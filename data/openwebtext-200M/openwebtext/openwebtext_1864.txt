As Nasa prepares to launch a mission to Pluto , the space tourism industry is gearing up for blast - off in 2009 .
But before you book a ticket , consider this : weightlessness is just falling with style , and as for a spaceship ...
Planet Earth is the best you 'll find , and it 's free !
It is easy to forget that we are in space already .
We are moving through it on a rocky globe that has sufficient gravity to hold us firmly to its surface .
Indeed , Earth has so much gravitational attraction that - unlike the Moon - it can hold down individual gas molecules and provide us with an atmosphere .
" Spaceship Earth " even rotates to give us a good view all round .
Packed with food , minerals and natural resources , it is by far the best spaceship we have .
But of course by space we normally mean " outer space " - the immense , cold , dark place up there , where " nobody can hear you scream " .

The definition of outer space is straightforward - outer space begins where our atmosphere ends .
Our atmosphere gradually peters out and gets thinner , so it does n't have a clear boundary .
However , at an altitude of 100 km ( 62 miles ) the atmosphere is so tenuous that for many purposes it can be regarded as absent .
Accordingly , 100 km is generally taken to be the limit of our atmosphere and therefore the edge of space .
The 100 km mark is n't totally arbitrary - it is also termed the Karman line after Theodore von Karman : a pioneer of aeronautics .
Karman calculated that at this altitude the air is so thin that a conventional aircraft would need to be going so fast to get any lift under its wings that it might as well lose them , give up , and be a spacecraft instead .
( This is something of an oversimplification - but that 's the essence of it . )
But what of gravity - does gravity end at the Karman line ?
The answer is a firm no .
At 100 km , an astronaut 's weight has only fallen by about 3 % .
In higher Earth orbits , an astronaut 's weight decreases further , but even at an altitude of 2,600 km , it is still a half of its Earthbound value .
High dives
At great distances from Earth , gravity does eventually fall to almost zero - but orbiting astronauts remain , relatively speaking , close to our planet where gravity maintains high values .
As an example , the space shuttle was designed to go no higher than 1,000 km and , by all accounts , has never exceeded more than two - thirds of that .
SPACE TOURISM PLANS Richard Branson is planning flights into space as early as 2009
He has teamed up with famed aircraft designer Burt Rutan
In 2004 Rutan won the X - Prize for the first private piloted spaceflight Tickets on Branson 's Virgin Galactic service are $ 200 k ( £ 114 k )
Test flights are due to start next year
Clear sky for Virgin spaceship Orbiting astronauts are n't weightless , they merely have the sensation of weightlessness - and you do n't even need to be in outer space to experience this sensation .
Olympic divers lose their sensation of weight every time they jump off a high board .
Skydivers have the same sensation for a short time after they jump from their aircraft .
These sensations are unfamiliar to most of us , because few of us are high divers or skydivers , but we have all felt something related to this whilst travelling in a lift .
While you do n't actually feel weightless in a lift , sometimes you do feel briefly heavier or lighter .
To understand the feeling of absolute weightlessness we need to stretch our imaginations and take this lift example to its extreme .
Should you ever be unlucky enough to be in a lift when its cable breaks , you would feel exactly the same sensation of weightlessness as a high diver , skydiver or indeed an astronaut in orbit .
You , your fellow passengers and other loose items in the lift compartment would even appear to float around as you descend .
Whenever you fall freely under the influence of gravity you feel weightless - in fact , gravity seems to disappear , but it has n't .
So orbiting astronauts are n't really weightless , they merely feel weightless because they are falling .
This is a puzzle , because astronauts experience apparent weightlessness for hours , days , even months .
How can they fall for so long without hitting the ground ?
The orbiting body is moving sideways so fast that , despite falling towards the Earth , it quite literally keeps missing it
Isaac Newton provided a solution a long time ago .
Newton reasoned that , because the Earth has a curved surface , the ground gradually curves downwards and falls in height as you move across it .
He proposed that , if a falling object could move across the Earth 's surface rapidly enough as it fell , the surface of the Earth might fall away under it at the same rate .
In this way , a falling object could maintain the same height above the ground , despite falling .
By travelling fast enough to follow the Earth 's curvature , it could literally " fall around " it .
What Newton was describing was a low - Earth orbit .
There are other ways of explaining how this works .
Another , perhaps simplistic , way is to argue that the orbiting body is moving sideways so fast that , despite falling towards the Earth , it quite literally keeps missing it .
8 km/ second
For future space - tourists and the unconvinced , we can put some figures into Newton 's example to illustrate .
At an altitude of 100 km , your spaceship will fall vertically by about 4.75 m every second .
Flying start : Space tourism flight trials are due to start next year However , calculations show that the Earth 's curved surface also drops in height by 4.75 m when you travel across it for about 8,000 m .
This means that as long as your spacecraft is travelling across the Earth 's surface at about 8,000 m per second as it falls , you should maintain the same height .
You are in orbit .
While the principle of a low - Earth orbit is straightforward , it poses many challenges .
Eight kilometres per second is about 29,000 km per hour or 18,000 mph - you simply can't go this fast in the atmosphere due to the immense drag forces produced .
Even if the necessary power were somehow available , the heat generated by the friction would cause your vehicle to burn up .
To go this fast , you need to get above the restrictive atmosphere - above the Karman line - into space .
This is the real reason why astronautics is commonly associated with weightlessness .
It really has little to do with escaping gravity , especially in the vicinity of Earth .
It is to do with escaping the atmosphere .
Only above the atmosphere can astronauts attain the immense speeds necessary for orbit .
Once in orbit they are constantly falling and this gives them the appearance of being weightless .
Sounds fun .
But I for one do n't intend to become a space tourist .
Spaceship Earth is fine by me - I do n't need expensive tickets to travel on it , and I can also see outer space from it .
It 's the best spaceship we have .
Rather than paying to leave it , maybe we should concentrate on looking after it - and all its passengers .
Nick Allen is a Master of Science in astrophysics and a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society .
Your comments : Good article ... I would have to agree that we should be concentrating on taking care of Earth rather than trying to leave it .
Apparently , this opinion is not the popular opinion .

Three hundred years ago , when Captain Cook sailed , home was just little England .
Now many of us , including Mr. Allen , think of the entire earth as our home because of explorers like Cook .
One day because of space exploration , the definition of " home " will be further broadened .
Perhaps in one hundred years , you will see an article written on the BBC by a similarly minded " homebody " like Mr. Allen advocating that we humans should not venture beyond Pluto and the Kuiper belt , and instead focus on exploring and improving our home in the solar sytem within the orbits of Neptune and Pluto .
Mike Dwyer , Tokyo , Japan Excellent piece of scientific writing .
I would have never known the fact about ' Karman Line ' .
It has motivated me enough to do a bit of my own study on weightlessness .
Reynel Castelino , Norfolk , VA,USA
I disagree - I do n't feel weightless when I skydive .
When you leave the plane you quickly accelerate to about 120 mph , and the wind resistance gives the impression of lying on something soft .
Your weight feels firmly supported by it , although obviously it is n't .
I for one ( were I rich ) would love to travel into space , purely to see the Earth from that unique viewpoint .
It would be a colossal waste of money though , when you consider how many people your money could help instead .
Rob Low , Tunbridge Wells , Kent , England RESPONSE FROM ARTICLE'S AUTHOR : Hi Rob , I totally agree - you certainly wo n't feel weightless when you reach your terminal velocity at about 120 mph .
You can only have the sensation of weightlessness when you are freely accelerating .
That 's why I was very careful to write that skydivers only have this sensation " for a short time after they leave their aircraft . "
BTW , thanks for all the nice comments .
Nick Allen
All very interesting Nick , and I know your article is somewhat tongue - in - cheek , but I think you are missing the point of space tourism .
For me the experience would not be about pseudo weightlessness but rather the thrill of the ride and most of all the view out the porthole .
Looking down at the distant earth as it passes beneath me and marvelling at the unhindered clarity of the sky would surely be worth the expense .
Duncan I , Worthing
This was the first time I was able to understand the whole concept of low earth orbit fully .
Thank you very much .
Now can you please write something simple like this about catapulting satellites , probes using the gravity of planets .
I think I will understand that concept with some more reflection , but just in case ...
Keep writing stuff like this , please .
clifford , Montreal , Canada
After a 3 year physics course with space science modules over the final two years , I can quite definitely say I would n't go up into orbit in a spacecraft in this age .
The amount of dangers posed by space debris , the risks from the spacecraft launch , and above all the fact that the protection from cosmic rays and particles emitted by the sun is vastly reduced in orbit make me very comfortable studying space with my feet on the ground .
Alex Vukmirovic , Southampton
Thanks for an informative and readable article on the difference between weightlessness and free fall .
I 'd just like to take issue with you on one point though .
Free fall is n't quite like falling , as we usually experience it .
It 's a lot more like floating underwater .
Describing it as falling does n't do justice to the wonderful feeling of freedom and security that comes with it .
As a nervous airline passenger I was worried that a parabolic flight would feel like really bad turbulence .
Instead it feels like the best scuba diving ever , only better .

Nice to see someone finally trying to put an end to the popular misconception that there 's no gravity in space and that being in orbit is merely perpetual free - fall !
However I 'd jump at the chance to go see space ship earth from space ( wherever that is !? ) !

Hordes of giant mice are devouring endangered seabird chicks on a remote South Atlantic island and may be pushing some of the birds to extinction , scientists report .
The carnage has harmed the breeding success of endangered Tristan albatrosses and threatened Atlantic petrels on Gough Island , a British territory a thousand miles ( 1,600 kilometers ) off the coast of South Africa .
The birds ' sole breeding ground is home to 22 bird species — 10 million birds in total — and is considered the world 's most important seabird colony .
Common house mice were introduced to the island more than a century ago .
Now three times larger than normal mice , the invasive rodents likely number more than a million .
Video cameras revealed one pack of ten mice feeding on a Tristan albatross chick 's wounds as it nested on the ground .
Footage also showed mice devouring Atlantic petrel and great shearwater chicks .
The birds did not fight off their attackers , even as some mice fed inside the body cavity of one albatross chick .
Researchers say the footage provides the first hard evidence that mice previously thought harmless to seabirds are willing to attack prey more than 300 times their weight .
" Like a House Cat Attacking a Hippo "
Nearly three feet ( one meter ) tall , a Tristan albatross chick can weigh up to 22 pounds ( 10 kilograms ) , or about as much as a turkey .
Gough Island mice weigh just 1.2 ounces ( 35 grams ) on average .
Geoff Hilton , a U.K. - based biologist with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and study co-author , has compared the mismatch to a house cat attacking a hippopotamus .
Hilton and his colleagues say that while the seabird chicks can defend themselves from other birds , the chicks do n't appear to be programmed to fend off novel predators like mice .
Ross Wanless , a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Cape Town , led the study , published in the online edition of the journal Biology Letters .
" The mice on Gough are amongst the biggest wild house mice in the world .
In winter , they eat through the ' island larder ' until they start to run out of seeds and invertebrates , " he said .
" At that point they increasingly start to eat seabirds , as well as other mice .
A Gough winter is not a nice place to be a seabird or a mouse . "
Wanless says Gough Island mice are depressing bird populations and will cause some species , such as the Tristan albatross , to go extinct if left unchecked .
The researchers believe mice become predatory when other introduced animal pests , such as rats and cats , are eliminated , freeing the mice from competition and predation .
While small in area , ocean islands sustain the world 's highest diversity of bird species , the researchers note , adding that over the past four centuries , 90 percent of global bird extinctions have involved island species .
Many such extinctions have been caused or aggravated by rats , cats , and other introduced animal pests .

Some other reason ?
It was deemed " must have " functionality for a number of reasons .
Two obvious ones being : 1 . dropping it would be a regression vs FC5 .
2 . It 's a major line item for RHEL5 , and Fedora is supposedly where stuff like this gets beaten into shape first .

Right now , as far as Xen goes , I 'm sitting on the fence waiting to see where things land .
With most of our virtualisation team tied up in hammering out RHEL5 , and Xensource sitting on their thumbs wrt pushing stuff upstream , I 'm not optimistic at all that anything notable will happen .
The grim meathook future currently looks like this : * Xensource 's Xen tree is based on 2.6.16 ( Yes , sixteen ) * FC6 has a 2.6.18 kernel and a rebase of Xen that Red Hat did .
* kernel.org current stable is .19
We can't move to this as an FC6 update until we get Xen in shape .
Juan mentioned that he 's going to jump on this soon , but its probably at least a weeks work .
* devel / is current on the road toward .20rc1 , and has n't got Xen applied at all ( zillions of rejects ) .
I find it hard to talk about Xen in person without cursing .

tbh , I agree with you .
Fedora should not be hostage to RHEL feature requirements .
Merging Xen was the single biggest headache I 've faced in kernel maintainence in the last 3.5 years .
Even NPTL against the RHL 2.4 kernels was a walk in the park compared to this fiasco .

Or something else ? )
Someone else .
I 'm not sure if it 's public , so I probably should n't say anything more ( though its probably not hard to figure out ) .

The bug in question had been there for months .
It turned out that it only affected filesystems made with 1 K block sizes , which is n't the default , but we did n't know that at first .
As this was a corner case , it unsurprisingly did n't get a great deal of testing .

Towards the end of FC6 dev cycle , we did a few things differently to improve things .
* bi-weekly status meetings .
Just a half hour concall to make sure everyone knew the state of the onion .
*
Will started hashing out test plans .
* Some process documentation got put on the wiki . * I believe there are weekly ( ? ) test team irc meetings .
Something else that should see the light of day at some point will be the eventual opening of our internal QA test harnesses ( along with some of the tests that we put a RHEL release through ) .
Getting stuff like this into the hands of eager wannabe testers is going to be really useful . >
More questions that you could ask , besides ' why did it go wrong last > time ? ' would be things like how does Fedora define a showstopper ?
Basically ' blocking ' criteria is something like .. * large class of machines does n't boot * really common machine does n't boot * installer falls over really easily with no workaround * common network cards do n't work ( preventing updates ) .
It 's spelled out a lot better than my feeble memory can remember somewhere on the fedoraproject.org wiki .
Good questions .
I snipped some of them that I felt others could answer better than I could , but I hope the above helps .

I think one the main topics in the Circos discussion group is how to install it , especially as it requires some specific Perl and C libraries to be in place .
This short tutorial gives a step - by - step overview on how to make Circos work on OS X , but it should be similar to other * nix flavours .
I just installed on my Mountain Lion box , but , again , it should be identical to previous versions of OS X .
My Circos is installed on
Circos location 1 / Applications / circos -0.55 /
and if we try running it
Circos trial run 1 $ perl / Applications / circos-0.55/bin/circos
I get this error , initially
Circos runtime error 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Can ' t locate Config / General.pm in @INC ( @INC contains : / Applications / circos-0.55/bin/lib /Applications/circos-0.55/bin/../lib /Applications/circos-0.55/bin /Library / Perl/5.12/darwin-thread-multi-2level / Library / Perl/5.12 /Network/Library /Perl/5.12/darwin-thread-multi-2level /Network / Library / Perl/5.12 / Library / Perl/ Updates/5.12.4/darwin-thread-multi-2level

/System / Library / Perl/Extras/5.12 . ) at / Applications / circos-0.55/bin/../lib/Circos.pm line 53 .
BEGIN failed -- compilation aborted at / Applications / circos-0.55/bin/../lib/Circos.pm line 53 .
Compilation failed in require at / Applications / circos -0.55 / bin / circos line 184 . BEGIN failed -- compilation aborted at / Applications / circos - 0.55 / bin / circos line 184 .
So , a lot of things going wrong , we need to check what is missing and install .
Circos has a couple of commands bundled in its package that help us working through the errors .
Best way to run them is to cd into Circos bin directory
Circos : checking modules 1 2 $ cd / Applications / circos-0.55/bin/ /Applications/circos-0.55/bin $ ./list.modules
In my case , running this script gave me a list of the required modules for Circos
Circos requirements 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 Carp Config:: General Data:: Dumper Digest:: MD5 File :: Basename File :: Spec:: Functions FindBin GD GD :: Polyline Getopt :: Long Graphics :: ColorObject IO :: File List:: MoreUtils List :: Util Math :: Bezier Math :: BigFloat Math :: Round Math:: VecStat Memoize POSIX Params :: Validate Pod:: Usage Readonly Regexp :: Common Set:: IntSpan Storable Time :: HiRes
Another script checks for the current status of each module ( still from the same dir )
Circos checking modules 1 / Applications / circos -0.55 / bin $ ./test.modules
and this finally gives me a list of the current status of each one of the required modules
Circos : requirements 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 ok Carp fail Config :: General is not usable ( it or a sub- module is missing ) ok Data : : Dumper ok Digest :: MD5 ok File : : Basename ok File :: Spec:: Functions ok FindBin fail GD is not usable ( it or a sub- module is missing ) fail GD : : Polyline is not usable ( it or a sub- module is missing ) ok Getopt : : Long fail Graphics : : ColorObject is not usable ( it or a sub- module is missing ) ok IO : : File ok List :: MoreUtils ok List :: Util fail Math : : Bezier is not usable ( it or a sub- module is missing ) ok Math : : BigFloat ok Math : : Round fail Math :: VecStat is not usable ( it or a sub- module is missing ) ok Memoize ok POSIX ok Params : : Validate ok Pod :: Usage fail Readonly is not usable ( it or a sub- module is missing ) ok Regexp : : Common fail Set : : IntSpan is not usable ( it or a sub- module is missing ) ok Storable ok Time : : HiRes
We have to address everything that failed in the test .
In this case , GD , Graphics : : ColorObjects , Math :: VecStat , Readonly and Set:: IntSpan .
We leave GD behind for a moment and focus on the other modules ( this list might vary for each Perl installation , so you might need to install more or less modules , but the commands are similar ) .
The easiest way to install module in Perl is to use cpan , the repository of Perl modules .
It has an interactive shell that we can use , and we will see how to do that .
In order to make sure our installation works we use sudo and call cpan ( from any directory )
1 $ sudo cpan
If this is the first time you are running it , just answer yes to all config questions and you are good to go .
Now we have to install the five modules required .
By using the command install , that can be achieved
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 cpan $ install Config :: General - output omitted - cpan $ install Graphics :: ColorObject - output omitted - cpan $ install Math : : Bezier - output omitted - cpan $ install Math :: VecStat - output omitted - cpan $ install Readonly - output omitted - cpan $ install Set : : IntSpan - output omitted -
Now , we deal with the last module and usually the most labourious to install , GD .
Ideally you should have all possible library support for GD and for this you have to install additional libraries .
We are going to start with two of the most common and see if we need anything else .
Usually libjpeg and libpng are required by GD .
So , let ’s download both of them
Downloading and install libjpeg and libpng 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 $ mkdir srctemp $ cd srctemp srctemp $ curl - O http://www.ijg.org/files/jpegsrc.v8d.tar.gz srctemp $ tar - xzvf jpegsrc.v8d.tar.gz srctemp $ cd jpeg - 8d srctemp / jpeg - 8d $ ./ configure srctemp / jpeg -8d $ make srctemp / jpeg - 8d $ sudo make install srctemp / jpeg - 8d $ cd .. srctemp $ curl - O ftp://ftp.simplesystems.org/pub/libpng/png/src/libpng16/libpng-1.6.2.tar.gz srctemp $ tar - xzvf libpng - 1.6.2.tar.gz srctemp $ cd libpng - 1.6.2.tar.gz srctemp/libpng-1.6.2 $ ./ configure srctemp/libpng-1.6.2 $ make srctemp / libpng - 1.6.2 $ sudo make install
That should do it for now .
We will download GD and check if the configuration we have so far is enough .
GD ’s website is still down , but we can get the source from Bitbucket and use identical commands to install is
Installing GD 1 2 3 4 srctemp $ curl - O https://bitbucket.org/libgd/gd-libgd/downloads/libgd-2.1.0-rc2.tar.gz srctemp $ tar - xzvf libgd - 2.1.0-rc2.tar.gz srctemp $ cd libgd - 2.1.0-rc2 srctemp/libgd-2.1.0-rc2/src $ ./ configure
At the end of the configuration run , you should see something like this
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ** Configuration summary for gd 2.1.0 : Support for PNG library : yes Support for JPEG library : yes Support for Freetype 2.x library : yes Support for Fontconfig library : yes Support for Xpm library : no Support for pthreads : yes
In my case , I ’m good to go .
But if in your case Freetype and Fontconfig are missing , you would have to download , configure , make and install them , just like libpng and libjpeg .
So now
1 2 srctemp / pierrejoye-gd-libgd -5551f61978e3/src $ make srctemp / pierrejoye - gd- libgd - 5551f61978e3/src $ sudo make install
We are almost there .
The last step is to install GD in Perl .
Normally , if we use cpan to install it on OS X , it fails .
So , we will have to do it by hand .
We go to CPAN website and download the latest Perl ’s GD implementation and with similar commands to above we install it .
Installing GD on perl 1 2 3 4 5 6 srctemp $ curl - O http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/L/LD/LDS/GD-2.49.tar.gz
( if curl fails copy and past on your browser ) srctemp $ tar - xzvf GD - 2.49.tar.gz srctemp $ cd GD - 2.49 srctemp / GD-2.49 $ perl Makefile .
PL srctemp/GD-2.49 $ make srctemp / GD - 2.49 $ sudo make install
you should see some output , maybe some warnings , but if you followed all the steps above the installation worked .
You can run the test .
modules script in order to check .
Leave a comment , if you get any errors , or send me an email .
The advice is all very practical .
But it ’s also a little pat and , as that salute to smiles as a social leveler suggests , naïvely patronizing in a way that ’s worth examining .
Critics of public diplomacy have been quick to disparage the American belief that international tensions can be eased by dispatching an official to proclaim that deep down we are all united by our love for , say , children — a Hughes staple — when the animus , in fact , arises from real policy differences with the U.S. government .
The pursuit of private diplomacy rests on the opposite innocent illusion : just tone down crass Americans ’ noisy cultural differences from others , and political and economic harmony can follow .
But what if Americans have no monopoly on brashness and do n’t really rate any longer as the overweening cultural trendsetters our demonizers , and we , reflexively assume ?
In essence , the mission of the American as World Citizen is to try and fit in better , or at any rate to stick out less : just what the U.S. as a nation is resented for making no attempt to do .
But it ’s hard to know which of our features cry out for modulation .
Does Turkey , a proudly secular and deeply devout society , distrust us for our wild popular culture or for our moralizing piety ?
Whatever might be the case , a mere 17 percent of respondents registered a positive image of Americans , according to a recent Pew survey , and only 3 percent expressed confidence in Bush , putting Turkey at the top of the list of U.S. detractors .
Meanwhile , two recent pop-culture sensations — a pulp thriller called “ Metal Storm ” and a film called “ Valley of the Wolves ” — feature the U.S. military as marauding invaders .
Paradoxically enough , the Turkish forces who take brutal revenge resemble nothing so much as their nemesis .
There is n’t much difference , it seems , between the Hollywood invasion thriller and the anti-Hollywood invasion thriller .
What may be most confusing of all is the warm welcome U.S. visitors actually receive in a country that is as culturally cacophonous as America and labors under no inhibitions when it comes to boasting and bullying .
The demurely dressed American tourist ( shoulders and knees covered , often in khaki ) can’t walk a block in Istanbul without seeing Turks wearing hijabs and jilbabs ( those modest coatdress coverings ) side by side with tank tops and tight jeans — and without getting lectured about where the true cradle of cultural diversity lies .
Here ’s a collision of secularism and Islamism , the Turks are right , that owes more to Ataturk and centuries of entanglement with Europe than to the corrosive allure of New World exports .
Busily monitoring our well - known tendency to strident self - importance , earnest American practitioners of personal diplomacy can risk missing the genuinely humbling lesson of being abroad : an awareness of how bewildering another country ’s own blend of boorishness and fervent belief , of openness and defiance , of backwardness and progress and of internal dissensions can be .
In the end , it ’s as narcissistic to assume we ’re the overbearing cause of everybody else ’s national identity crises in a dizzying world as it is to imagine that we can orchestrate the solutions to them .
The sobering , and liberating , truth is that our britches are not that big .
Readers responded to my last post with lots of theories and personal reports on people ’s preferences in interracial dating .
Also some complaints that I seemed to be asking for comments about only whites and blacks — an impression I did n’t mean to give .
Researchers have been studying other races , too .
They ’ve found that theories and anecdotal evidence are n’t a very reliable guide to these questions : some of the common stereotypes do n’t match the data .
Some of you did get it right , like Dan , who hypothesized that Asians are relatively more willing to date outside their race .
David predicted that black men are more likely to date white women than white men are to date black women — which is right , although not for the reason many people think .
It ’s not that white men are more reluctant to date non-whites ; it ’s that black women are less willing to date someone of another race .
At least that ’s the picture that emerges from studies of online daters and speed daters .
Men are generally willing to date someone of another race , but women are more reluctant , especially African - American women .
Consider “ Racial Preferences in Dating , ” a study of more than 400 graduate and professional students who participated in speed dating sessions at Columbia University organized by Raymond Fisman , Sheena S. Iyengar , Emir Kamenica and Itamar Simonson .
The researchers conclude : “ Even in a population of relatively progressive individuals who have self - selected into participation in a multi-cultural Speed Dating event , we observe strong racial preferences . ”
There ’s also a clear gender divide , as the researchers note : “ Women of all races exhibit strong same race preferences , while men of no race exhibit a statistically significant same race preference . ”
You might think the gender gap is the result of different dating goals : perhaps the men are more interested in short - term flings , whereas the women are looking for a lasting relationship and are concerned about potential complications from cultural differences .
But the researchers conclude otherwise after looking at the data :
“ Since older subjects ( who are more likely to attend the Speed Dating sessions in hope of starting a serious relationship ) have a weaker same race preference , this gender difference is unlikely to result from differential dating goals between men and women . ”
The researchers found that most women speed daters said yes ( meaning they ’d like to see a man again after the four - minute speed date ) less often to men of another race than they did to men of their own race .
Here ’s how much less interested they were in the other races , as compared with their enthusiasm for men of their own race :
African - American women said yes about 30 percent less often to Hispanic men ; about 45 percent less often to white men ; about 65 percent less often to Asian men .
White women said yes about 30 percent less often to black or Hispanic men , and about 65 percent less often to Asian men .
Hispanic women said yes about 20 percent less often to black or white men , and 50 percent less often to Asian men .
Asian women did n’t discriminate much by race ( except for showing a very slight preference for Asian men over black or Hispanic men ) .
After noting who said yes to whom , the researchers analyzed a confounding factor : the men ’s physical attractiveness .
They found that the women of different races generally agreed with one another in rating the various men ’s attractiveness — and that they were less willing to date a man of another race even when he was just as attractive as a man of their own race .
When the researchers controlled for the men ’s attractiveness , they found that white , Hispanic and Asian women generally showed about the same level of same - race preference , while black women showed a significantly higher preference .
These results from the speed dating experiment roughly jibe with the study I cited in the earlier post about height - income tradeoffs .
In that analysis of more than 20,000 online daters , split roughly evenly between Boston and San Diego , men did n’t show much preference for same - race partners .
Women did , and African - American women showed the most pronounced preference .
The researchers , after controlling for all other attributes ( height , weight , attractiveness , etc. ) , calculated how much extra income ( relative to the income of the average online male dater , $ 62,500 ) a man would need to overcome the racial barrier .
Here are some of the estimates ( there were n’t enough data to do all the interracial permutations ) of how much each extra income a man would need to be equally appealing to a woman as would a man of her own race :
For equal success with an African - American woman , a Hispanic man needs to earn an extra $ 184,000 ; a white man needs to earn an additional $ 220,000 .
For equal success with a white woman , an African - American needs to earn an additional $ 154,000 ; a Hispanic man needs $ 77,000 ; an Asian needs $ 247,000 .
For equal success with a Hispanic woman , an African - American man needs to earn an additional $ 30,000 ; a white man needs to earn an additional $ 59,000 .
For equal success with an Asian woman , an African - American needs no additional income ; a white man needs $ 24,000 less than average ; a Hispanic man needs $ 28,000 more than average .
I ’ll leave you with two questions :
Why do women have these preferences ?
And what might prompt them to pay less attention to a man ’s race ?
NYT : Main beneficiary of Edwards ' non-profit is Edwards himself RAW STORY
Published : Thursday June 21 , 2007 Print This Email
This
In order to keep his public profile up after the 2004 presidential election , John Edwards , no longer in the senate , started a non-profit organization called the Center for Promise and Opportunity .
The organization had the stated goal of " fighting poverty " and since 2005 has raised $ 1.3 million .
But , " unlike a sister charity created to raise scholarship money for poor students -- the main beneficiary of the center 's fund - raising was Edwards himself , federal tax filings show , " the New York Times is reporting .
Excerpts below : #
The organization became a big part of a shadow political apparatus for Mr. Edwards after his defeat as the Democratic vice presidential nominee in 2004 and before the start of his presidential bid this time around .
Its officers were members of his political staff , and it helped pay for his nearly constant travel , including to early primary states .
While Mr. Edwards said the organizations purpose was making the eradication of poverty the cause of this generation ,  its federal filings say it financed retreats and seminars  with foreign policy experts on Iraq and national security issues .
Unlike the scholarship charity , donations to it were not tax deductible , and , significantly , it did not have to disclose its donors  as political action committees and other political fund - raising vehicles do  and there were no limits on the size of individual donations .
...
But it was his use of a tax - exempt organization to finance his travel and employ people connected to his past and current campaigns that went beyond what most other prospective candidates have done before pursuing national office .
And according to experts on nonprofit foundations , Mr. Edwards pushed at the boundaries of how far such organizations can venture into the political realm .
Such entities , which are regulated under Section 501C - 4 of the tax code , can engage in advocacy but cannot make partisan political activities their primary purpose without risking loss of their tax - exempt status .

' Sign o’ the Times ' Is Prince 's Masterpiece .
The Road to Get There Was Filled With Hardship .
In 1986 , he recorded and scrapped at least three different album projects , toured the world , broke up his most celebrated backing band , …
Authorities confiscated more than $ 200 million in U.S. currency from methamphetamine producers in one of this city ’s ritziest neighborhoods , they said Friday , calling it the largest drug cash seizure in history .
The seizure reflected the vast scope of an illegal drug trade linking Asia , Mexico and the United States , officials said .
Two of the seven people arrested Thursday at a faux Mediterranean villa in the Lomas de Chapultepec neighborhood were Chinese nationals .
The group was part of a larger drug - trafficking organization that imports “ precursor chemicals ” from companies in India and China for processing into methamphetamine in Mexican “ super labs , ” authorities said .
The methamphetamine is eventually sold in the United States .
The raid resulted from an investigation that began in December , when authorities seized 19 tons of pseudoephedrine , a cold medicine that is a key ingredient in the production of methamphetamine , at a Mexican port on the Pacific Coast .
A legally registered Mexican company , listed by a trade association as the country ’s third - largest importer of pseudoephedrine , was implicated , officials said .
Mexican drug - trafficking organizations have become increasingly important in the U.S. methamphetamine trade , because the U.S. has imposed tougher controls on the sale of the chemicals used to produce the highly addictive drug .
President Felipe Calderon hailed the seizure as a major development in his government ’s war on drug traffickers , who have ravaged several Mexican cities and towns .
“ We are working in a decisive manner to save our country and to keep Mexico safe and clean , ” Calderon told an audience in Tijuana .
“ I do n’t even want to imagine how many young people this gang poisoned with its drugs .
But I can assure you , they will do it no longer . ”
Mexican officials said the cash seized was mostly in U.S. $ 100 bills and weighed at least 4,500 pounds .
“ Kudos for the Mexicans , ” said Donald C. Semesky , financial operations chief for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration .
“ They ’re very serious in this effort , and we commend them . ”
U.S. officials said that , if confirmed , the cash seizure would be several times larger than any other made from drug traffickers .
A spokesman for the Mexican attorney general ’s office said that experts were still analyzing the $ 205.6 million in cash to check for counterfeits but that the bills appeared to be legitimate .
Officials with the attorney general ’s organized crime unit used a moving truck , guarded by a 25 patrol - car caravan , to take the money to its headquarters .
Authorities said the traffickers were led by a naturalized Mexican citizen of Chinese descent who appeared to have left the country .
Several machines for manufacturing pills were found at the site , but the group did not produce drugs there .
The mansion appeared to serve as a financial operations center and cash storage facility .
Exclusive neighborhood
The neighborhood is home to some of the capital ’s wealthiest residents and many members of the diplomatic corps .
The back of the property is contiguous with a racquetball court at the Ukrainian ambassador ’s residence .
The Israeli Embassy is a few blocks away .
Most neighbors and the many maids and security guards who work in the area declined to comment on the raid .
The few who did said they had no knowledge of illicit activity .
“ The problem is that all of these houses are veritable fortresses , ” said one of the neighborhood ’s security guards , who asked not to be named .
“ You never know what goes on inside .
The doors open automatically .
The owners all have chauffeurs .
People go in and out , and you never see anything . ”
A driver - bodyguard arrested at the house had told neighbors he was a retired lieutenant colonel in the Mexican army .
Neighbors said he walked a German shepherd along the tree - lined streets .
Authorities said the chain of events that brought police to the mansion began in December , when they discovered a shipping container filled with barrels of pseudoephedrine on a storage lot at customs offices in Lazaro Cardenas , a port city about 175 miles northwest of Acapulco .
The chemicals had been manufactured in China and shipped to Mexico on a British - flagged vessel that was bound for Long Beach .
The seizure led authorities to a chemical company , Unimed Pharm Chem , based in the city of Toluca , about 40 miles west of Mexico City .
The company reported legally importing 32 tons of pseudoephedrine in 2004 .
“ The resulting investigation showed that this company illegally imported ... pseudoephedrine acetate from India , ” the attorney general ’s office said in a statement .
“ These chemicals are used to illegally produce methamphetamines . ”
Mexican Atty Gen. Eduardo Medina Mora said in a radio interview that one of the Chinese exporters involved in shipping the chemicals to Mexico is an illicit “ shadow ” company not registered with Chinese authorities .
Last year , Mexican authorities raided what they termed the largest methamphetamine lab in the Western Hemisphere at an industrial park in Guadalajara .
The factory had 11 custom - designed pressure cookers capable of producing 400 pounds of the drug each day , about 20 times the production of a typical California lab .
U.S. officials estimate that 80 % of the methamphetamine sold on U.S. streets is produced by Mexican criminal organizations .
For these drug cartels , whose business mushroomed when they became the middlemen in the shipment of Colombian cocaine to the United States , methamphetamine is a lucrative side business worth billions of dollars , analysts say .
Officials at the DEA ’s Office of Financial Operations estimated that 90 % of the money transferred from the United States to Latin American suppliers of drugs leaves the U.S. as cash .
Drug traffickers transfer $ 8 billion to $ 24 billion to Mexico each year , according to authorities .
$ 100 bills preferred
Most of the cash is carried across the U.S. - Mexico border by car or on foot as $ 10 and $ 20 bills and later converted to $ 100 bills , officials say .
Semesky said $ 100 bills are the preferred method for making large payments between drug organizations , because they are less bulky .
With $ 20 bills , $ 1 million weighs 110 pounds .
“ They do n’t want to build a storage location for 20s , ” the DEA ’s Semesky said of the drug traffickers .
“ You ’re talking about decreasing that bulk at least five times . ”
Before Friday , the largest reported amount of cash seized by Mexican authorities was $ 7 million , which was found inside electric appliances at Mexico City ’s international airport in 2005 .
The appliances were headed for Colombia .
Mexican officials said they worked past midnight Thursday to count the seized bills , which were hidden inside locked metal shelves , suitcases and closets .
It was five times the amount that was seized in all of 2006 by Mexican authorities in anti-narcotic and money - laundering operations .
To provide a sense of the scale of the money involved , Mexican media compared the amount seized to various items in the 2007 federal budget .
The $ 205.6 million was more than the funding allocated to pensions for the handicapped by Mexico ’s social security agency .
It exceeded the amount of public funds provided to Mexico ’s political parties for campaign spending and also surpassed the budget of the Mexican Senate .
“ It ’s a lot of money , and we did n’t know a thing , ” said one security guard assigned to a nearby property .
“ We work outside and ca n’t even imagine what goes on inside these houses . ”

Budget airline RyanAir today unveiled their new ‘ pay as you weigh ’ pricing policy that will mean extra charges for customers exceeding the airline ’s recommended flying weight .
Under their revised terms and conditions those passengers deemed to be ‘ fatties ’ will be charged an increasing scale of penalty charges for the extra fuel costs they incur the airline .
RyanAir boss Michael O’Leary said he had done his utmost to deter fat people from flying on his airline , over - pricing the sandwiches or just having no food on sale whatsoever , but fat people simply resorted to boarding his planes with big bags of sandwiches , crisps and fizzy drinks .
Henceforth RyanAir customers will be required to give details of their height and weight at the point of booking .
Those with a body mass index ( BMI ) over 26 will be charged GBP25 for every BMI point they are over the limit .
These criteria have drawn heavy criticism from air travellers claiming that they are ‘ big boned ’ and pointing out that ‘ muscle weighs more than fat ’ .
RyanAir ’s check in staff have now been instructed to look out for people misrepresenting their weight on their booking forms .
As well as having to measure the dimensions of their hand luggage , passengers will now be required to pass through a metal frame of fixed width .
If they cannot squeeze through , an alarm will sound and a red light will flash the word ‘ Fat Bastard ’ above their heads .
Security staff on the x-ray machines have also been asked to look out for concealed cakes , pies and giant toblerones .
However RyanAir was prepared to concede that it was highly discriminatory to include pregnant women in the ‘ Fat Tax ’ scheme .
Instead mothers carrying unborn children will simply be charged the price of two passengers .

Egyptians accuse foreigners — including one American — of terror plots CAIRO ( AP )  Police have arrested an American , 11 Europeans and several others from Arab countries for allegedly plotting terrorist attacks in Middle Eastern countries including Iraq , the Interior Ministry said Monday .
The group was part of an Islamic militant terror cell that had adopted extremist ideas and were living in Egypt under the guise of studying Arabic and Islamic studies , the ministry said in a statement .
Along with the American , police arrested two Belgians , nine French and several others from Egypt and other Arab countries including Tunisia and Syria , the statement said .
The ministry did not provide names or say how many Egyptians and Arabs were arrested .
" Investigations have confirmed that those elements are related to some terrorist organizations abroad , " the ministry said .
" They were seeking to recruit others , teach them destructive beliefs , urging them for jihad , traveling to Iraq to carry out operations via other countries in the region . "
The U.S. Embassy in Cairo declined to comment about the arrests .
Telephone messages left with the Belgium and French embassies were not immediately returned .
They were arrested about a week ago , and some had been studying at Al - Azhar University , Sunni Islam 's most important seat of learning , police officials said .
They spoke on condition on anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media .
It was not immediately clear if all the arrests took place in Cairo .
All of the arrested were in jail pending further investigation , the ministry said .
Egypt has witnessed a string of suicide terror attacks in recent years at Sinai Peninsula tourist resorts .
Last week , an Egyptian state security court condemned to death three Islamic militants convicted of taking part in suicide attacks that killed 34 people in 2004 in the Sinai resort of town of Taba .
The three belonged to the militant group Tawhid and Jihad , which Egyptian security officials and prosecutors accuse of carrying out two other bombings against Sinai resorts that killed another 87 people — Sharm el - Sheik in July 2005 and Dahab in April .
In February , three British Muslims were released from an Egyptian prison after spending nearly three years in custody for allegedly belonging to a banned Islamic group .
The three accused Egyptian authorities of torturing them during their captivity , but the government denied the allegations .
Egypt operates under emergency laws , which gives the government wide powers to detain suspects without charging them .
The laws have been in place since the assassination of President Anwar Sadat in 1981 despite a growing chorus of opposition from both inside and outside the country .

To qualify for conscientious objector status and to be granted military discharge on that basis , an individual must oppose all wars , not just a particular war .
However , a conscientious objector may still embrace “ spiritual warfare ” between good and evil , the Department of Defense explained in a new policy instruction ( pdf ) .
“ An individual who desires to choose the war in which he or she will participate is not a Conscientious Objector under the law .
The individual ’s objection must be to all wars rather than a specific war . ”
But “ a belief in a theocratic or spiritual war between the powers of good and evil does not constitute a willingness to participate in ‘ war ’ within the meaning of this Instruction . ”
In other words , it is possible both to be a “ spiritual warrior ” and a conscientious objector .
It is uncertain whether enlisting in spiritual warfare on the side of evil would void this distinction .

Leandro from Brazil wrote in with a classic and crucial question :
Do you need a college degree to be successful ?
Leandro is 21 and currently studies computer engineering and does NOT like it .
His parents think he absolutely needs the degree – he does n’t :o )
My take : No .
You do n’t need a college degree to be happy and successful .
I myself have a university degree ( a masters in computer science ) – but I chose my studies 100 % based on my interests at the time .
I was a major geek and my studies let me do some pretty cool stuff .
And while I would not have gotten my first “ real ” job without my degree , I would of course have gotten another job – even without the degree .
And anyway , my first job sucked :o )
I believe success comes from doing something that :
You ’re good at You like doing Someone is willing to pay you for
You need all three .
Does this such an area currently exist for you ?
Be realistic !
If such an area does not currently exist , you can make one for yourself – and one way to do this is to study .
But considering how many possibilities are out there , I refuse to believe that this can only be achieved by suffering through 4 - 5 years of boring , unpleasant studying , just so you can wave a piece of paper around after you graduate .
Also , ask yourself this :
If you truly do not enjoy your studies – how much can you possibly enjoy working in the same field later ?
For a long time we ’ve been telling people that “ Sure , studying is not much fun , but you just have to get through 4 - 5 years of it and then everything is gravy . ”
First of all , this rarely turns out to be true , and secondly , this tends to make higher education an exercise in conformity – not learning .
Those who complete their studies are not necessarily the best and the brightest , but those most willing to knuckle under and do as they ’re told .
If I were in Leandro ’s shoes , I would either :
Find a way to make my studies fun .
Study with some fun people , go for some fun classes , work on my strategies and the way I spend time .
If that ’s not possible , I ’d witch to some kind of studies I really liked and found interesting or to a different school , where they did n’t make things as boring .
Or alternatively get a job or start my own company and do something really cool
What ’s your take on this ?
Did you enjoy studying ?
How did you choose your studies ?
Are you happy and successful with or without a degree ?

Google is undertaking the most radical change to its search results ever , introducing a “ Universal Search ” system that will blend listings from its news , video , images , local and book search engines among those it gathers from crawling web pages .
The new system officially rolls out today for anyone using Google.com and searching in English .
Not everyone will see it at first , but over the course of the next several days , Universal Search should be more , well , universal .
A new navigational interface has also been unveiled for Google and is covered more in the companion piece to this article , Google ’s New Navigational Links : An Illustrated Guide .
The move potentially should be a huge boon for searchers , while search marketers who have paid attention to the importance of specialized or vertical search will see new opportunities .
To fully explain the importance to both groups , I ’m going to work step - by - step through the concept of vertical search engines , how they ’re often ignored by searchers and search marketers alike , then how Google is going to make this content more visible through Universal Search .
As this is a long article , here are jumps to specific sections , should you wish to skip ahead :
What The Hell Is Vertical Search ?
I hate the term vertical search .
I routinely ask audiences if they understand what it means , and significant numbers do n’t .
I prefer the term specialized search or specialty search , but the financial community in particular has popularized the use of “ vertical ” search .
Let me explain the concept .
Regular search — when you go to Google , Yahoo , Microsoft , Ask or any general - purpose search engine — is a “ horizontal ” search in that you are searching across a wide spectrum of material .
Information from sports sites , news sites , medical sites , shopping sites — the entire horizontal spectrum of topics is represented .
With vertical search , you slice down vertically through one topic area .
You search only against the news sites or against the medical information , for example .
This type of focus can make for more relevant results .
Need help on fixing windows in your house ?
Search on that horizontally , and information about the Windows operating system might dominate the listings , simply because there ’s so much about Windows out there .
Try using a vertical search engine that only has home improvement information , and information about repairing the type of windows you look out of should become much more visible and relevant .
Making Vertical Search Visible
Sadly , many people are unaware of the vertical search resources that are out there .
Indeed , Google has long put links to its vertical search services above the search box on its home page .
First they were in the form of “ tabs , ” then later as regular links that currently promote that you can vertically search for images , or video , or news , or maps or in many more specialized areas .
To really understand all the vertical searches Google itself runs , consider this list :
“ You almost need a search engine for all our search engines , ” said Google ’s Marissa Mayer , vice president of search products and user experience , in talking with me about today ’s Universal Search news .
“ We ’re so excited about taking all these different silos of information and making them all into one . ”
Certainly the home page links have n’t worked to expose the vertical richness .
Few searchers use those links .
Test this yourself .
Ask someone if they know what those links do .
Quite often , they ’ll tell you no — in fact , that they ’ve not seen them before .
I ’ve shown people how do to an image search using them and literally gotten gasps of astonishment in response .
These people had no idea you could search and get back actual images .
I ’ve long written about this problem and described the solution as “ invisible tabs . ”
From my article on the topic back in December 2003 :
Many people simply do not see or use tabs , just like they regularly ignore drop down boxes , radio buttons and any type of other option you put out .
Search engines have told me this over the years , and I also see it first hand … .
The solution to tab blindness is clearly for me and an army of other search educators to head out and teach people how to use tabs !
Naturally , that ’s not going to happen .
No , the solution really is for the search engines to make use of “ invisible tabs , ” where they make the correct choice for the user , behind the scenes .
This is what Google is doing with Universal Search .
Google ’s hitting several of its vertical search services all at once , then bringing back those results to blend in with “ regular ” results .
More Than A OneBox To Me & Book Search Blending
Has n’t Google been already making vertical results available through those OneBox displays that appear at the top of some search results ?
Yes , but Universal Search is going beyond that .
Let ’s look at Google Book Search to illustrate this .
Google Book Search is Google ’s vertical search engine that lets you find matching pages within books that it has scanned .
Curious about that part in Tom Sawyer where he was whitewashing the fence ?
Enter tom sawyer fence , and Google Book Search tells you it ’s on page 22 of one edition of Mark Twain ’s classic novel .
So , Google Book Search lets you look within the content of books , but only if you specifically know to use that search engine .
Most people just turn to Google ’s regular search .
That ’s why Google tries to remind you there ’s more than web search using OneBox displays like this :
See how the arrow is pointing at book search matches ?
This little section is called a OneBox , and it sits above and separate from the 10 “ regular ” search results that come from Google ’s crawling of the web .
This is effectively Google saying “ Hey !
We ’ve got a book search engine with matches for this .
You might want to check the results there ! ”
If you did click through , you ’d then search just against the book content and get back matching book pages , like this :
Some people skip past the OneBox prompts because they look weird compared to the “ real ” results .
However , Mayer said the bigger issue was that OneBoxes were “ clunky ” and often not as relevant as the results coming below them .
For example , Mayer said that the first result in Google might get clicked on more than a third of the time out of all the clicks on that page .
In fact , Google ’s search quality team makes it a goal to try and make that first result as relevant as possible .
In contrast , the OneBox insertions get clicked on less despite getting prime placement on the page , since they are n’t as relevant .
Universal Search aims to fix this through blending .
With Universal Search , Google will hit a range of its vertical search engines , then decide if the relevancy of a result from book search is higher than a match from web page search .
( FYI , Infoseek got a patent related to this type of blending back in 1997 ; See also : Google ’s Universal Search Patent Application & Assigned Patents from Infoseek from SEO By The Sea ) .
If so , a web page result might get dropped and a book search result inserted .
That means instead of a OneBox , book results will begin showing up in Google search like this :
See how this is the same page listed at the top of Google Book Search , when I did a specific search there .
This screenshot from Google illustrates how in the future , that “ book page ” will just get mixed in among the web pages of regular Google searches .
Of course , Google already does this with some of its other properties .
For example :
So mixing in book search results is n’t quite as radical as it sounds on the face of it .
On the other hand , listings from the services above are getting in because they ’re part of the web page index , as best I can tell .
Rather than replacing a web page listing , as Universal Search does with book search , they ’ll be part of web search ( and potentially one of the listings that might get kicked out to make room for material from a vertical resource ) .
FYI , the OneBoxes are n’t dead , not even for cases where Universal Search is in place .
In other words , you might still see a news OneBox or a Books OneBox .
Says Google :
While the OneBox has n’t entirely gone away , it has been replaced in many cases by blended results in relevant positions .
As we continue development , we ’ll continue to evolve our use of both the OneBox and blended results to deliver the most relevant results .
News & Local Blending
I ’ve covered how book search results will be blended .
Let ’s turn next to news and local result blending , since they work in similar ways .
Here ’s how news results currently get inserted :
As Universal Search rolls out this week , that OneBox display will get replaced , with news material blended like this :
Similarly , local search results are being integrated .
Before Universal Search , a OneBox would display them like this :
With Universal Search , they ’re blended like this :
FYI , news search results began being blended last month , for some people , as part of an official change .
Local blending started getting spotted by other widely yesterday .
Single Listing Vs. Multiple Listings Replacement
( NOTE : I ’ve updated and clarified this section since Universal Search went live )
With the news blending example above , Google dropped only one of its usual web page listings to insert either a news unit .
That unit can move around , by the way .
It might be at the top of the page , somewhere in the middle or even at the end , based on wherever Google determines it will be most relevant related to the other listings .
But what it is NOT supposed to be is positioned outside the regular 10 results in the way the OneBoxes have historically been .
Instead , these units take one of the 10 regular positions .
With the local blending example , you can see that three web page results have been removed to make room for the three local listings along with the map .
But sometimes , only one local listing will show .
Google told me :
For the time - being , three local results are taking the place of three web results for result sets that trigger a grouped local UI .
This happens only to categorical use cases ( e.g. restaurants mountain view , new york dental school ) , where a group is appropriate .
When there ’s just one navigational result , like siam royal palo alto , there ’s only one local result displacing one web result .
While there are no immediate plans to change this , it could happen over time .
Google ’s not taking the more dramatic step of simply replacing the bulk of the 10 web page listings with news or local material , even if a query might indicate this makes sense .
For example , a search for new york hotels is pretty local oriented .
Why not shift over to showing a
full page of local results ?
Or if there ’s a breaking news event , say with the Virginia shooting , most people searching under that term probably would be better served by getting many more actual news results than shown in a single unit .
Video Blending & Video Meta Search
There ’s nothing new about Google listing links to video content in its regular search results , including links to pages in Google - owned Google Video and YouTube .
However , Universal Search is changing things .
Instead of considering that content as part of its web pages index , Universal Search will run a video search query across an enhanced version of Google Video .
What ’s enhanced ?
Google Video is morphing into a meta video search site , similar to how Blinkx operates .
Eventually , Google Video will list content that ’s hosted at Google Video , YouTube or anywhere on the web .
Today , Google Video itself will remain listing only Google Video and YouTube content .
The enhanced version will only be accessible through Universal Search .
In the near future , Google Video itself will shift over .
As for that video content , unlike with news and local , more than one blended results might appear .
For video content outside of Google Video and YouTube , the display will be like this :
Content on Google ’s own video hosting services will look like this :
See the little +
Watch Video part in the listing ?
That ’s a video Plus Box , which have been spotted in the past .
Now they are being formalized .
Clicking on that will open up the video and let you watch it within the search results , like this :
After years of people ignoring tabs and links designed to get them to do specialized searches , Google is taking the plunge to push the right buttons behind the scenes and make specialized or vertical search results part of the “ normal ” experience .
Image Blending & Multiple Blends
For some searches , matches from Google Image Search will appear .
Unlike the other blending , these will NOT take the place of one of the 10 regular listings .
They were found to be too disruptive that way , Mayer said .
Instead , those deemed to be of high relevancy will appear at the top of results , while those that are important but perhaps not as relevant will be shown at the bottom .
It ’s also important to note that blending may happen from one or more of the vertical search engines .
For example , Mayer talked about a search for Steve Jobs where pictures of him would be on top , news in the middle and a video clip at the bottom .
And Web Search Is ….?
One thing that ’s slightly confusing is that Universal Search will continue to be labeled as “ Web ” on the search results page .
OK , most of the content is coming from web - based sources ( Book Search is the key exception ) .
But aside from these vertical search databases , there also remains a WEB PAGE database , what Google originally started with and what remains the core to everything else .
I almost wish Google had labeled this “ All ” or “ Everything ” search , so that Web search could be a specific drill - down option for those specifically after web page content .
Impact On Searchers & Search Marketers
Overall , I think this is a great move for Google to make , assuming the actual implementation works .
Mayer was at pains to explain this is the start of Universal Search , and that Google expect to refine and adjust things going forward .
It should be helpful to searchers who have simply continued to ignore vertical search properties and miss out on good content within them .
As for search marketers , I ’ve written for years that there were to two major changes coming for search engines : personalization of results and the growth of vertical .
From 2003 :
As a search engine marketer , the implementation of invisible tabs means that traffic from organic web page listings will diminish over time .
The more specialty databases are implemented , the less traffic will fall to web search results .
That need n’t be a problem .
The skilled search engine marketer ’s most important asset is understanding how search engines get various types of listings , then helping their clients enter the appropriate databases .
Think beyond web page databases , and you ’ll be prepared for the future .
From last year :
Vertical search is important because it ’s one of the two major things I ’ve long talked about as being how search will advance .
First generation search analyzed words on a page to rank content .
Second generation search tapped into link analysis .
Third generation search to me is looking at both user input ( what we visit ; what we click on ; personalized results ) and making search go more vertical .
Why the generational jumps at all ?
To improve relevancy .
Each generation has fought the double challenge of being overwhelmed by increasing amounts of information to organize plus having ranking systems become more and more vulnerable to manipulation and outright spam .
Google ’s now done both now within the space of weeks , moved forward on the personalized and vertical fronts .
Google Ramps Up Personalized Search and Google Search History Expands , Becomes Web History cover key things that both marketers and searchers need to understand , on the personalized from .
As for verticals — search marketers must understand that the supremacy of web page search just took a major hit .
Web pages will still draw traffic — still plenty of traffic .
But vertical search databases offer what remains a largely unexplored and ignored frontier .
Pay attention to them , at Google and elsewhere .

Postscript , January 2008 : Be sure to read Google Universal Search : 2008 Edition on how Google Universal Search has continued to evolved .
Between my server and my Windows Media Center home theater PC , I have at least two PCs on all the time at home .
Have you ever wondered how much it 's costing you to leave a computer on 24 hours a day , 7 days a week ?
The first thing you need to know is how much power your computer draws .
The best way is to measure the actual power consumption .
You 'll need a $ 30 device like the Kill - a - Watt to do this accurately .
Once you get one , you 'll inevitably go through a phase where you run around your home , measuring the power draw of everything you can plug into a wall socket .
For example , I learned this weekend that our 42 " plasma television draws between 90 watts ( totally black screen ) and 270 watts ( totally white screen ) .
Based on a little ad - hoc channel surfing with an eye on the Kill - a - Watt 's LCD display , the average appears to be around 150 watts for a typical television show or movie .
But I digress .
Once you 've measured the power draw in watts ( or guesstimated the power draw ) , you 'll need to convert that to kilowatt - hours .
Here 's the kilowatt - hour calculation for my server , which draws ~ 160 watts :
160 watts * ( 8,760 hours per year ) / 1000 = 1401.6 kilowatt - hours
The other thing you 'll need to know is how much you 're paying for power in your area .
Power here in California is rather expensive and calculated using a byzantine rate structure .
According to this recent Mercury News article , the household average for our area is 14.28 cents per kilowatt - hour .
1401.6 kilowatt - hours * 14.28 cents / 100 = $ 200.15
So leaving my server on is costing me $ 200 / year , or $ 16.68 per month .
My home theater PC is a bit more frugal at 65 watts .
Using the same formulas , that costs me $ 81 / year or $ 6.75 per month .
So , how can you reduce the power draw of the PCs you leave on 24/7 ?
Configure the hard drives to sleep on inactivity .
You can do this via Control Panel , Power , and it 's particularly helpful if you have multiple drives in a machine .
My server has four hard drives , and they 're typically asleep at any given time .
That saves a solid 4 - 5 watts per drive .

Upgrade to a more efficient power supply .
A certain percentage of the input power to your PC is lost as waste during the conversion from wall power to something the PC can use .
At typical power loads ( ~90w ) , the average power supply efficiency is a disappointing 65 % .
But the good news is that there 's been a lot of recent vendor activity around more efficient power supplies .
The Fortron Zen fanless power supply , for example , offers an astonishing 83 % efficiency at 90w load !
If you upgraded your power supply , you could theoretically drop from 122w @ 65 % efficiency to 105w @ 83 % efficiency .
That 's only a savings of $ 20 per year in this 90w case , but the larger the power usage , the bigger the percentage savings .

Do n't use a high - end video card .
I 'm not sure this is widely understood now , but after the CPU , the video card is by far the biggest power consumer in a typical PC .
It 's not uncommon for the typical " mid-range " video card to suck down 20 + watts at idle -- and far more under actual use or gameplay !
The worrying number , though , is the idle one .
Pay close attention to the video card you use in an " always - on " machine .

This one 's kind of a no - brainer , but worth mentioning .
A CRT eats about 80 watts , and a LCD of equivalent size less than half that .

Disconnect peripherals you do n't use .
Have a server with a CD - ROM you rarely use ?
Disconnect the power to it .
A sound card you do n't use ?
Pull it out .
Redundant fans ?
Disconnect them .
That 's only a savings of a few watts , but it all adds up .
If you 're building a new PC , it 's also smart to avoid Intel 's Pentium 4 series , as they use substantially more power than their AMD equivalents .
Intel 's Pentium - M , on the other hand , delivers the best bang for the watt on the market .
Although it was originally designed for laptops , it can be retrofitted into desktops .

Group develops fresh new way to promote impeachment
Michael Roston
Published : Tuesday May 15 , 2007 Print This Email This
A group seeking to promote the impeachment of President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney is hoping to further their case by appealing to many Congress members ' well known sweet tooths .
The Progressive Democrats of America have offered to send ' ImpeachMINTS ' to Senators and Representatives in Congress .
" For a ' fresher democracy ' order yours today ! " the PDA website says .
The group , which helped drive a push in California last month to get the state 's Democratic Party to officially endorse impeachment , is seeking donations to send packets of the breath mints to Congressional offices .
With a $ 10 donation , the Progressive Democrats will send the candies to a donor 's Congressional representative .
A $ 15 donation send the mints to both of a donor 's senators as well as their Member of Congress .
More information is available at the PDA 's website .
The initiative was put forward by Australia 's indigenous affairs minister , Mal Brough , who said the compulsory teaching of English would help Aboriginal children living in remote and economically deprived communities to escape poverty and inequality and find jobs .
He also revealed that the government was considering a plan to require Aboriginal parents to ensure that their children attend school or risk losing welfare payments .
" If you do n't have maths and English and a basic education ... then you can't be employed , " Mr Brough said .
Referring to children living in some of Australia 's most inaccessible communities , he added : " Most of the children do n't speak any semblance of English .
So what chance have they got ? "
He said he was not suggesting that Aboriginal people should give up their own language but that they should follow the example of migrants to Australia , such as Greeks and Italians , who are bilingual .
His comments , made at a particularly sensitive time as Australia marks the 40th anniversary of the 1967 referendum that allowed Aborigines to be counted as citizens , infuriated some indigenous leaders .
Tauto Sansbury of the Aboriginal justice advocacy committee said the idea was insulting and would reinforce old - fashioned stereotypes .
" They still want to treat Aboriginal people the way it was back in the 30s and 40s , where they 're the master and we 're the servant and our attitude is ' yes boss , we 'll do what you want ' , " he said .
Another activist Sam Watson said the government seemed to be " inventing new ways of showing Aboriginal people cultural disrespect " .
Federal opposition education spokesman , Stephen Smith , however , said he agreed in principle with the government 's push for indigenous children to be compelled to learn English .
" As a general proposition , we have to improve the standards of Aboriginal literacy and numeracy , " he said .
" We have to go right back to basics .
We have to sit down frankly and say , ' All of the things we 've done in the past , where have we ended up ? ' "
Indigenous MP Linda Burney agreed that speaking English would help lift indigenous children out of poverty and inequality .
" Aboriginal kids do need to be bilingual but it's a bit rich coming from a person who actually is part of a government that took away funding for bilingual programs in the Northern Territory , " she said .
" It is important for Aboriginal children to speak English but it can't be at the expense of your mother tongue . "
Australia 's 460,000 Aborigines make up 2 % of the population and are the country 's most disadvantaged group , with far higher rates of unemployment , alcohol and drug abuse , domestic violence and health problems .
The number of Aboriginal languages that existed in Australia prior to colonisation is estimated to be about 600 .
Currently there are 200 different Aborginal dialects across Australia , with about 20 in constant use .
Many Aborigines speak dialects mixed with English that may be incomprehensible to an inexperienced listener .
This is a public service announcement to all project managers , business analysts , others working in the I.T. industry , and the general public : producing good software is hard .
The next time you wonder why the software you are using crashed , or why your software development project is behind schedule , or why your software does n't meet the users needs , remember this point .
People I have dealt with professionally who are not software developers occasionally make comments that imply that writing enterprise business software is a fairly straight - forward task , easily handled by the average developer .
I have challenged these statements by pointing out that reality disagrees .
The majority of software development projects are overrun or canceled .
Software that does make it into production often has serious operational failures , performance issues , or fails to meet users ' requirements , and much of it is poorly designed , making it difficult to correct these issues and implement enhancements .
These problems cannot be blamed solely upon weak developers .
Across the industry , the typical software development team will be staffed by average developers ( by definition ) , which means that the problems I just described affecting a majority of projects result from the efforts of average developers .
In defense of software developers , the leading causes of project failure or overrun are actually in the areas of project management ( i.e. overly aggressive schedules ) and requirements gathering .
Problems in these areas cause much more serious impacts , and this is perhaps why project managers and business analysts sometimes feel that writing the code is the easy part .
But it is not .
Even assuming sufficient time , clear requirements , and a decent solution architecture ( which are big assumptions ) , producing working , high - quality code is hard .
Why is this ?
I 'll first look at meeting the functional requirements .
For a typical enterprise business application many of the functional requirements are admittedly simple , and can be summarized as creating data entry screens for a particular set of data .
Many of the enterprise business applications I have been involved with , however , also have more complex functional requirements such as complex business rules , batch processing , web services , or data conversion .
These more challenging requirements are the ones most likely to cause problems for the development team .
Software must also meet non-functional requirements in areas such as performance , usability , and maintainability , and I believe that most enterprise software does poorly in these areas .
It is simple to explain why : everyone is focused on meeting the functional requirements - clients , testers , and project managers as well as developers - so the non-functional requirements are neglected .
Even when someone - most often the architect - considers the non-functional requirements , it is difficult to address them all at the same time .
Typically multiple iterations are necessary .
For example , a developer first writes code that meets the functional requirements , then tries out the user interface and make improvements to address usability issues , then tests and addresses performance issues , and finally cleans up the code to ensure the design is maintainable - easy to understand and modify .
These multiple iterations take time , skill and dedication , and if a developer is lacking in one of these areas , the non-functional requirements will likely be neglected .
Combine the challenges in both the functional and non-functional requirements , and the result is that the typical software application will fall short in at least one area .
Add in other common challenges like a compressed schedule and unclear or changing requirements , and the chance of success plummets even lower .
In other words , producing good software is hard .

THE VEEP’S OFFICE ….
Yesterday I wondered if National Review would take notice of Dick Cheney ’s laughable theory that the vice president is both a legislative and an executive officer and therefore bound by the rules of neither .
My money was on Mark Levin to make some kind of bizarre , pretzel - like defense of Cheney ’s assertion , but today I was disappointed .
Levin can usually be counted on to say something kookily belligerent no matter what the subject , but he decided to lay low on this one :
Rather than arguing that the vice president , as president of the Senate , is exempt from coverage , I would have argued that this is a purely internal executive branch issue .
Therefore , who cares what Dick Durbin , Rahm Emanuel or the Democrat front group CREW have to say about it .
Levin does n’t quite admit that Cheney ’s theory is absurd , but he does sensibly suggest that it ’s not exactly a winning argument .
Meanwhile , the Weekly Standard ’s Bill Kristol , after offering a desultory defense of Cheney on the grounds that oversight is “ a pain in the neck , ” also decided that discretion was the better part of valor .
After Juan Williams pushed back , all Kristol could offer was a defeated shrug .
When you do n’t even have Mark Levin and Bill Kristol on your side , it ’s time to give it up .
Maybe noted constitutional scholar Ann Coulter will find a way to defend Cheney , but it looks like that ’s about it .
Everybody knows that New Orleans was founded by the French .
But the area where we stand in Alabama also used to be part of the French North American empire in the 18th century .
Not far from here , north of Montgomery , was a military fort called Fort Toulouse .
The French controlled one third of the continent at the time .
The reason why I have to deliver this presentation in English today , however , is of course that the French lost most of their empire in 1763 , at the end of the Seven Years ' War — or what Americans call the French and Indian War .
The French were great explorers but , as the saying goes , their empire was a giant with clay feet .
Although France was by far the largest country in Europe — it had 20 million inhabitants in 1700 , compared with six million for England and Wales — it sent very few settlers across the Atlantic .
Most of the ten million or so French Canadians who live in Canada and the United States today are descendants of only some 10,000 settlers who stayed on this continent .
Huguenots were forbidden to settle in the colony and hundreds of thousands went elsewhere in Europe and North America instead .
But the main reason why so few Frenchmen crossed the Atlantic is that there was not much to do in Canada — not because of the weather , to which colonists quickly adapted , but because of the abysmally stupid French economic policy .
Mercantilism was of course the official doctrine in France , just like in England .
The colony was seen as a source of raw materials for the benefit of the mother country .
The fur trade with the Indians was its main economic activity .
This could have allowed colonists to accumulate some capital to develop other activities .
But during most of the period , it was in the hands of a monopoly , and profits went to France instead of being reinvested in Canada .
There were n't many opportunities for investments anyway .
There was very little that could be profitably produced in Canada .
Apart from small - scale crafts , manufacturing was forbidden when it would bring competition to metropolitan producers .
The prices of various goods were controlled .
And silliest of all , trade with the neighbors — the English colonies to the south — was forbidden , although contraband was widespread .
One thing the French managed particularly badly was money .
Until the 1660s , when there were still only about 3,000 French settlers in the St. Lawrence Valley , economic exchange in the colony took place primarily by barter .
Beaver pelts constituted the most commonly traded commodity , but other types of pelts , as well as liquor , served as alternative media of exchange .
Religious orders brought some money to the colony , and once a year , the King would send a large sum to pay for the administration and the soldiers stationed in the colony .
Most of that money was paid to metropolitan merchants for imported goods and brought back to France .
The government started manipulating the money in 1661 , by ordaining that the value of currencies circulating in Canada should be 25 % higher than their nominal values in France .
This was designed to induce currency imports , favor the monetization of economic exchange and integrate colonial economic activity with that of the mother country .
But of course the revaluation had its perverse effects .
It led to an inflow of poor quality French coins containing a large proportion of copper , while merchants only accepted gold and silver coins as payment .
By most accounts , the price level in Canada gradually increased to accommodate the revaluation so that the purchasing power of metropolitan currency was unchanged in the long run .
In his History of Money and Banking in the United States , Murray Rothbard writes that apart from medieval China , the world had never seen government paper money until the colonial government of Massachusetts emitted a fiat paper issue in 1690 .
In a footnote however , he explains that the only exception was a curious form of paper money issued five years earlier in Quebec , which became known as " card money . "
You wo n't be surprised to learn that war and protectionism had something to do with the appearance of paper money , in both New France and Massachusetts .
To simplify a bit , the two empires were then vying for control of the Great Lakes area , which at the time was the new frontier of the fur trade .
The Dutch and English merchants in Albany , New York , were able to offer a higher price than the French for the pelts and were attracting some of the Indian allies of the French , as well as French adventurers who were selling fur in contraband .
They were also arming their Iroquois allies and encouraging them to attack French parties and their Indian allies .
The French were constantly at war with the Iroquois .
In 1684 , new soldiers had arrived from France for another campaign against them .
However , in the fall of that year , the annual appropriations failed to arrive .
The intendant of the colony , Jacques de Meulles , had no funds to pay colonial officials and troops .
( The intendant was what could be called the top bureaucrat in the colony , second only to the governor who represented the king . )
In June 1685 , he decided to issue his own credit notes .
Because good paper was rare , he collected the playing cards in the colony and , with his seal and signature , issued them in various denominations as paper money .
By an ordinance , the cards became legal tender and merchants had to accept them .
It is perhaps just a coincidence , but it is certainly fitting that inflationary paper money , which is often called " funny money , " appeared on this continent as playing cards with a bureaucrat 's signature on them .
At first however , the issue of card money was not inflationary .
The cards were backed by funds that were supposed to arrive from France , and were fully redeemed when those funds arrived .
From the point of view of the authorities , they also had the advantage of being worth nothing to New Yorkers and New Englanders .
They could not be used for trade and did not contribute to any outflow of currency — trade and currency outflow of course being bad from a mercantilist perspective .
Five years later , the French and the English were again at war with each other .
In 1689 , during the Glorious Revolution , William of Orange had acceded to the English throne , and James II had fled to France .
In North America , there were raiding parties on both sides of the border and major invasion plans were drawn up .
A French plan to invade the city of New York and deport its population never materialized .
But in the summer of 1690 , a flotilla of 32 ships with 2000 men left Boston , while 2500 English soldiers and Indian fighters left on foot to invade the St. Lawrence Valley .
Fortunately for my ancestors , bad weather , luck and an epidemic of smallpox among the troops saved New France .
The English had to return to Boston without any booty .
Soldiers were grumbling for their pay and there was fear of a mutiny .
The Massachusetts government tried without success to borrow from Boston merchants .
In December 1690 , it decided to print £ 7,000 in paper notes and , as Rothbard explains , pledged " that it would redeem them in gold or silver out of tax revenue in a few years and that absolutely no further paper notes would be issued .
Characteristically , however , both parts of the pledge went quickly by the board :
The issue limit disappeared in a few months , and all the bills continued unredeemed for nearly 40 years . "
Massachusetts would again issue massive amounts of paper money after another failed expedition against Quebec in 1711 .
As might be expected , in Canada too , the intendant got into the habit of issuing card money .
As confidence in the new money grew , the population began to regard it as a stable asset and to retain a proportion instead of redeeming their entire holdings every year .
But instead of keeping currency reserves to cover the card money still in circulation , colonial authorities increased their spending .
They also started to issue card money in excess of the French government 's annual appropriation .
The cards were very useful but prices started increasing as people realized that there were more and more of them in circulation .
In the early 1700s , the War of the Spanish Succession extended to the French and English colonies in North America .
Military spending rose continuously and the growth in the supply of card money far outstripped that of the colonial budget .
In 1705 , the French Crown refused to redeem all of the card money presented to it , which amounted to a devaluation .
The colonial authorities responded by creating more .
Inflation was running rampant and the colonial economy was in disarray .
In 1714 , the Crown decided to get rid of this system and to buy back the cards at half their face value .
For some years , the monetary situation reverted to what it had been before 1685 .
Various attempts were made to provide the colony with a stable currency , which only ended up creating more confusion .
In 1729 , a new issue of card money was made .
By this time however , it was n't the only form of paper money , nor the most important .
The government started issuing promissory notes , which were redeemable by a bill of exchange on the Naval Treasury , in outlying regions where currency and even card money was in short supply .
Unlike card money , they could be issued by any number of military officers and control of their supply lay beyond both the intendant and the metropolitan government .
The inflation thus created amounted to a tax to finance military expenditures .

The situation deteriorated until the fall of Quebec City and Montreal in 1759 and 1760 , which brought about the final end of the French regime .
The war years were marked by economic breakdown and something close to hyperinflation .
During the peace negotiations , France agreed to convert card money and Treasury paper into interest - earning debentures , with discounts ranging from 50 to 80 percent .
However , with the French government essentially bankrupt , these bonds quickly fell to a discount and , by 1771 , they were worthless .
A Quebec historian , Gérard Filteau , wrote ( my translation ) :
What is remarkable about the Canadian financial system is that it inaugurates a new kind of money destined to have a great future : the cards are the first banknotes in circulation .
Another remarkable fact is that the country has no asset , no monetary reserve to guarantee the value of its paper money .
This money is nothing but a representative sign , which gets its value from the honesty of the government and the goodwill of the royal treasury .
Such a guarantee , based solely on morality , is insufficient in that it ties the value of money to the good behavior of a few bureaucrats , and imposes on it fluctuations that depend on the integrity of some men and the vicissitudes of politics .
At the time of the conquest , there were only 70,000 colonists in New France , as opposed to more than a million in the English colonies to the south .
Paper money helped to destabilize and slow down the economic and demographic development of New France .
It contributed to the downfall of the French empire in North America .
Later , it would play a substantial role in the French and America revolutions .
Today , unfortunately , it is used the world over and continues to distort economic calculations .

Most software development projects , in fact most IT development projects have unforeseen problems that cause them to run late , overrun budgets , collapse under their own weight or get cancelled .
This is best practice , it is not a problem , it only looks like a problem .
A Thought Experiment
A bank has an annual budget of $ 10 million for internal software projects , all projects are the same size and complexity .
Over the years it has collected all sorts of data about the projects it runs , it has found that projects have fallen into two distinct groups :
Group One
These are projects run by standard development groups and behave pretty normally .
They normally succeed , but often take longer and cost more than originally expected and sometimes have unforeseen problems , during or after development .
In general things work out , but very few projects go completely to plan , approximately 15 % of projects are cancelled outright and never result in anything usable .
Projects normally cost about $ 100,000 to complete , involve a number of developers , testers , a documenter and a project manager .
They typically take 3 - 6 months
Group Two
These projects are critical and use the critical development process , they are no larger nor more complicated than group one projects , but cost of error or project failure is very high ( e.g. death , bankruptcy etc ) .
These projects are very thoroughly researched , designed and developed , they are verified using tools and manual review at each stage and all products are formally tested before being integrated into the whole product .
Prototypes are created to illuminate unfamiliar areas .
All issues are tracked back to their point of origin , analysed and the software is checked for errors with the same pathology or method of introduction , sometimes new processes are added to the methodology to prevent similar errors being introduced .
The bank has never cancelled one of these projects after initial evaluation and so far , they have all been completed to time and budget .
Projects normally cost $ 1 million , involve several inter - dependant development teams each with its own testers , project manager and documenter .
There is an independent test team that continually tests the products of the development teams , a documentation team , a project board and an overall project manager .
These projects typically take 12 - 24 months .
In summary group one projects cost $ 100,000 and take 3 - 6 months , but are not fully controlled , 15 % failure .
Group two projects of the SAME SIZE and COMPLEXITY cost 10 times more and take much longer , but always work as expected .
The Software development manager moves to a new position where he is advising blue chip multinationals about introducing in house software development , none of these blue chip companies use software that could kill anyone or bankrupt the company , which process should be suggest :
Group 1
or Group 2
Well …
For $ 10 million you can have
Group 1 :
10,000,000 / 100,000 ) * 85 % and some hassle because project do n’t run to plan .
=> 85 successful projects .
Group 2 :
( 10,000,000 / 1,000,000 ) * 100 % and some hassle because the development process is so much work .
=> 10 successful projects .
And even though group 1 projects overrun , they still take less time than group 2 projects , because most of the overrun is unforeseen work , not mistakes .
Conclusion
Group 1 , every time .
In the real world
The European information technology observatory ( http://www.eito.com/) estimates total IT spending for 2007 will exceed 2 Trillion US$ , that a whole lot , about one Microsoft every 8 weeks .
Clearly some of this is basic office equipment and other zero risk expenses , but using almost any percentage you care to name ( I seem to remember 40 % from somewhere ) there is still an awful lot being spent on new developments and other higher risk projects .
This is important because the numbers are large enough that statistical effects are overwhelming .
Best practice is not to work out every detail in advance , not to test everything to absolute certainty , best practice is to work on the fine detail of a project on the project .
In best practice , we find things out after the project has started , in best practice projects often run late , overrun budgets and occasionally get cancelled .
Best practice is not an excuse to do a bad job , good staff , concerted effort at all stages and sound practices are still needed .
However , shit happens , live with it .
For some reasons why this might be see
What is obvious to me now and The very brilliant , Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering will be useful as well .
This is best practice , it is not a problem , it only looks like a problem .

One of the most enduring stereotypes spread by religious people about atheists is that we are “ angry ” .
Some particularly creative apologists add the detail that what we are truly angry at is God – which is impossible , by definition , since a person must first believe in God as a precondition of being angry at God – or that we react with anger or hostility to the mere mention of the religious beliefs of others .
However , many theists who make this claim leave it at stating that atheists carry around some kind of generalized , diffuse anger at everything and nothing .
Needless to say , the standard purpose of these stereotypes is to smear and disparage atheists by making it seem as if we are somehow less than complete as people .
But it should come as no surprise that I have observed precisely the opposite to be true : when we are not confronted by religious harassment and oppression , atheists in general are ordinary , normal , happy people , just like everyone else .
I have been writing for this website for over five years now , and in that time , I have had the chance to meet , interact with , and speak to a great number of my fellow atheists .
I can testify from personal experience that atheists , on the average , are no angrier than theists and in some cases less angry .
All we want is what everyone wants : to live our lives in peace and security , to make our own decisions and live as we see fit , free of outside harm and harassment .
We are generally quite peaceful and happy – when we are not being harassed by others who want to convert us , treat us as inferior , or take our civil rights away , that is !
On the other hand , what is indisputable is that there is a huge amount of anger seething and fuming among religious people .
Not all religious people are angry or embittered , of course , but a very great number of them apparently are .
The surest evidence of this is that whenever a public figure speaks out against religion , or worse , takes any sort of action to oppose the encroachments of religion , such as filing a lawsuit to defend the constitutionally mandated separation of church and state , that person inevitably becomes the target of a blistering torrent of profane , obscene , violent , and threatening messages .
Many believers , it is apparent , lash out with furious and disproportionate rage and hatred when their beliefs are challenged or opposed in any way .
Take the most famous example , Michael Newdow , the atheist who filed a lawsuit to have the phrase “ one nation under God ” removed from the Pledge of Allegiance on the self - evident grounds that it is an unconstitutional endorsement of religion .
As a result of this case , Newdow has received so many profane , hateful and violent phone messages that he has incorporated them into a parodic song , “ My God is in My Soul “ .
( Scroll down to song # 8 on that page to see the lyrics .
The phrases in quotation marks were culled from recordings left on Newdow ’s answering machine . )
Indeed , not only has Newdow been insulted and threatened , the same fate has befallen even reporters who merely gave him coverage .
From Bob Norman ’s 2002 article , “ First Pledge “ :
… some extremist Christians … once again exposed their savage underbellies .
They barraged Newdow with hundreds of death threats and hate mail .
I know this not only because he shared many of them with the national media but because I received them too .
… A man who identified himself as Scott Sandlin wrote in the subject line of his e-mail : “ YOU should be shot . ”
I ’ve written about mobsters , rogue cops , dirty politicians , and all manner of South Florida hustlers in the past , but I ’ve never been threatened like this .
Or consider the case of Jim McElroy , the lawyer representing atheist Philip Paulson in a church - state lawsuit over a massive cross on public property in Mount Soledad , California :
San Diego lawyer Jim McElroy insists he is n’t terribly bothered by the scathing insults and threats directed his way .
A few weeks back , someone wrote him an e-mail telling him to “ burn in hell . ”
Someone else sent a note that opened with the words , “ Hey Dumb * ** McElroy . ”
Then there was this message , e-mailed several months ago .
“ When outraged Americans come and commit justifiable homicide against James McElroy , I ’m throwing a party and inviting McElroy ’s family and friends and co-workers …
It will be a great festive day ! ” … McElroy is no stranger to controversial litigation .
He sued white supremacist Tom Metzger .
He represented a group of doctors who perform abortions in a battle against protesters .
As a crusading college student in Illinois , he engaged in organized debates against members of the Ku Klux Klan .
Still , McElroy said , the level of raw hatred directed his way in recent months rivals anything he has seen in his career .
On a recent morning , McElroy – the self - described “ black sheep ” son of Richard Nixon supporters – stood near his desk on the 14th floor of a Broadway high - rise and played some messages left on his answering machine .
“ I think you are absolutely disgusting , ” one caller said .
“ How can you get up in the morning and look at yourself in the mirror ? ”
Another caller declared , “ You guys are a bigger abomination than the doggone stupid atheists that you represent . ”
A few months ago , McElroy received a phone call so vitriolic that , at his secretary ’s urging , he notified the police .
The profanity - laced message threatened a Mafia - style “ hit ” on him .
“ It sounded like a cross between Tony Soprano and the ‘ Godfather , ' ” he recalled .
— ” Cross case brings mountain of hate mail “ , The San Diego Union - Tribune , 14 May 2006
Or take this example from the Des Moines Register :
“ Last Saturday I was on a panel with a local Muslim leader addressing the Muhammad cartoon controversy at Vanderbilt University , ” Seigenthaler said .
“ He and I had a respectful disagreement regarding publication of the cartoons .
But there was a fundamentalist Christian dentist in the audience who was shouting at the top of his voice that Islam was an evil , murderous religion .
I thought he might come after the panelist . ”
Security was called .
The Muslim leader said the dentist “ shows up everywhere I go . ” — ” Religious hate e-mail falsely uses reporter ’s name “ , 25 February 2006
Jim McElroy ’s experience was replicated by the Southern Poverty Law Center after their opposition to disgraced theocrat Roy Moore ’s placement of a Ten Commandments monument in the rotunda of an Alabama state judicial building :
After the case gained national attention in August , when Moore defied a court order to remove his monument , hundreds of hateful e-mails began pouring into the Center .
The messages ’ vitriolic tone became exceedingly strident after Moore was removed from office in mid-November …
Center leaders were called “ scumbags , ” “ Christ - killers ” and “ subhuman . ”
Many other messages labeled the Center staff as “ communist , ” and the tone of a great number was decidedly anti-Semitic .
Some hate mail merely entreated Center staff to “ be ashamed , ” while others called for the Center to “ burn in hell . ”
A Portland man wrote Cohen to say that he wanted to witness Cohen ’s public execution “ just for the opportunity to spit in your face beforehand . ”
… Following are excerpts :
“ Dees and Cohen are a pair of chickenhawk jackals who never tell the truth . ”
“ Dees is a godless s.o.b. jew and deserves to burn in hell . ”
“ You ’re the lowest form of human waste — just human maggots !
Enough is enough !
Quit your ongoing battle against Christians and religion in American society .
We true American citizens are going to be watching you and your organization closely now .
Many Christians are just now realizing who the real enemy is , and there is no doubt — whatsoever — our # 1 enemy in America is Morris Dees and his Southern Poverty Law Center .
We Christians are watching you closely now . ”
“ May the wrath of God be delivered upon you . ”
“ I hope all of you who had anything to do with removing the Ten Commandments die in a car accident with a fuel tanker along with the rest of your filthy , stinking , traitorous families ! ”

Keep your sick perverted thoughts to yourself .
No one else gives a *****, Maybe you ’ll see Hitler as you burn in hell !
YEE HA !
***** YOU AUSTIN CLINE DIE MOTHER *****, DIE !
In his forthcoming book The God Delusion , Richard Dawkins gives some examples of religious hate mail received by the Freedom from Religion Foundation .
Most is merely filthy and profane , but the last example , which stops just short of making a murderous threat , is genuinely chilling :
Satan worshipping scum …
Please die and go to hell …
I hope you get a painful disease like rectal cancer and die a slow painful death , so you can meet your god , SATAN …
If you do n’t like this country and what it was founded on & for , get the fuck out of it and go straight to hell …
PS
Fuck you , you comunist whore …
Get your black asses out of the U.S.A .
We will not go quietly away .
If in the future that requires violence just remember you brought it on .
My rifle is loaded .
And for sheer depths of hatred , few can match the following message sent to atheist filmmaker Brian Flemming :
You ’ve definitely got some nerve .
I ’d love to take a knife , gut you fools , and scream with joy as your insides spill out in front of you .
You are attempting to ignite a holy war in which some day I , and others like me , may have the pleasure of taking action like the above mentioned .
However , GOD teaches us not to seek vengeance , but to pray for those like you all .
I ’ll get comfort in knowing that the punishment GOD will bring to you will be 1000 times worse than anything I can inflict .
The best part is that you WILL suffer for eternity for these sins that you ’re completely ignorant about .
The Wrath of GOD will show no mercy .
For your sake , I hope the truth is revealed to you before the knife connects with your flesh .
Merry CHRISTMAS !!!
Even the Bible contains passages encouraging the hatred of nonbelievers ( and it is tempting to wonder whether passages such as these gave many of the people quoted above their ideas ) :
Do not I hate them , O Lord , that hate thee ?
And am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee ?
I hate them with perfect hatred : I count them mine enemies .
— Psalm 139:21 - 22
I realize I am quoting a lot of religious hate , but it is to make a point .
Clearly , there is a vast number of theists out there who are filled with anger and hatred ; however , no op - ed columnist or theologian , to my knowledge , has ever wondered why religious people always seem so angry .
Ironically , the evidence that religious people adduce to prove that atheists are angry usually never even approaches this level of vitriol .
Consider the following e-mail , held up by a Christian blogger as an example :
You think you know the truth ?
Do you talk to god ?
Why are you blindly supporting bush , and his boys ?
Because bush is a christian ?
That ’s the problem with christians .
They take a fairy tale ( the bible ) , and make it the truth .
Since you know the truth , this is a waste of my time writing you .
But I had to vent , because you people ( all religions ) are ****** up this planet .
This e-mail is certainly harshly worded and none too polite .
But does it even approach the level of hate on display above ?
Does it display the drooling lust for violence that much of the religious hate mail shows ?
Does it threaten the poster personally , or attack his sexuality or personal appearance ?
No .
It criticizes his beliefs and his actions , heatedly to be sure , but that is still a far cry from the psychopathic spasms of rage regularly targeted at atheists who speak out .
However uncivil the language , this was neither a threat nor an ad hominem attack , whereas atheists regularly experience both .
Too many religious individuals , when criticizing atheists for their supposed anger , confuse strong criticism with personal attacks .
But the question must be asked : even if this religious propaganda were correct and atheists were angrier than the average person , what would this prove ?
In other words , why is being angry necessarily a bad thing ?
When atheists look around the world , we see countless evils being done in the name of religion , countless examples of suffering and oppression being wrought on the downtrodden and the innocent and justified by invoking the name of God .
When we read the scriptures of many of these religions , we see shocking instances of cruelty and hatred being urged against nonbelievers .
And what makes the insult far worse is that these unjust practices are often defended as the epitome of goodness because they allegedly come from God .
What is the proper response to these evils if not anger ?
If we could observe these evils passively and not be stirred to emotion , that would be a far more serious indictment of atheism than the absurd claim that atheism is somehow discredited because we feel anger when we see the innocent and the weak being taken advantage of , as any emotionally healthy person would .
There are many famed religious figures both real and legendary who reacted with anger to events that outraged them .
According to the Christian Bible , Jesus was so angered to see the money - changers in the Jewish temple that he made a whip of cords , kicking over their tables and lashing them with his whip until they were driven out .
He also spoke harshly to people who challenged him , calling them “ whited sepulchres ” and “ serpents ” , as well as other examples of harsh denunciation .
Would Christians call Jesus an angry person because of this ?
In the Old Testament , when Moses returned from Mt. Sinai bearing the stone tablets of the Ten Commandments , he witnessed the Israelites worshipping a golden calf and was so angry that he threw the holy tablets of the law to the ground and smashed them to pieces .
Do Jews read this and wonder what made Moses such a bitter and angry person ?
Do they ask why he was so threatened by the golden calf , since it represented a deity he did not even believe in ?
Or do they conclude , just as Christians conclude after reading the story of Jesus cleansing the temple , that this anger was a righteous act provoked by sin and injustice ?
Clearly , the latter is the case .
But most religious people seem unwilling to apply a similarly forgiving standard toward atheists .
After all , there are many reasons why an atheist might legitimately feel angry .
One is the suffering inflicted on innocent people due to religion , described above .
It can not be overemphasized that this alone constitutes a more than sufficient rationale for anger at the false beliefs that are causing harm to people , but there are other reasons as well .
One is the claim , endlessly repeated by religious proselytizers , that upon our deaths we will go to Hell to suffer for all eternity , and that we deserve this fate .
Surely it is not hard to understand why an ordinary person would feel anger toward someone telling them that they deserve to be tortured .
Similarly , it should not be hard to understand why an atheist would feel resentment upon being told that we have no morals , that our lives are meaningless and hopeless , that we are all secret hypocrites , that we are unpatriotic and hate our country , and so on – claims that atheists do hear very frequently from obnoxious religious preachers .
Ironically , the believers most inclined to insist that atheists are angry are the ones who often turn this claim into a self - fulfilling prophecy by treating every atheist they meet with condescension and disrespect , and then acting shocked when they are answered in kind .
It should be emphasized that atheists have a real reason for feeling anger at the harm done by religion .
Namely , if there is no afterlife and no assurance of divine justice , then the suffering of innocents matters far more , because this is the only life we have and the only chance we have to get it right .
Every evil that happens and goes unpunished is , in a sense , an opportunity forever lost .
On the other hand , it is very strange that so many theists seem to display such anger and hatred .
After all , if they are correct and God is truly on their side , they cannot lose in the end , and surely God ’s infinite power cannot be thwarted or diminished in the slightest by anything any atheist could say or do .
If religious people truly believed what they say they do and were consistent about it , they should no more feel anger towards atheists than the lord of a mighty castle should feel angry or threatened by a child throwing pebbles at the wall .
Yet many religious people do seem to feel upset and threatened by atheists – they must , or they would not bother to hurl such epithets and threats at us .
What else could make them attempt to cow us into silence ?
What motivates the “ angry atheist ” stereotype ?
The most important reason , I suspect , is that it is a defense mechanism .
I have said in the past , and still maintain , that some believers are fundamentally threatened by the very idea of atheists existing , because they have been taught that only through belief in God can one find happiness , meaning or purpose .
The existence of a happy , content atheist leading a meaningful life would throw their entire worldview into question , and so they deny this psychologically threatening possibility by asserting that atheists are intrinsically “ angry ” and therefore lacking in peace or satisfaction .
Second , I argue that the claims of angry atheists also stem in part from psychological projection .
Many believers are so attached to their religious views and hold them in such high regard that they falsely assume that everyone else must feel the same way about those beliefs .
They therefore assume that only an angry , bitter person could fail to see the merit in what seems so obvious to them .
Dan Barker explains , in a passage from his book Losing Faith in Faith , that shows his usual keen insight : “ When some people hear criticism of their religious views , it makes them angry and they project that anger back on the messenger .
They assume that the feelings they experience when they read the criticism are the same feelings the skeptic had when it was written . ”
Finally , it should be said , this stereotype does contain a small grain of truth .
There have been a few atheists who treat all religious people with scorn and hostility , and an even rarer few who seem to take a perverse delight in being hated by the religious majority .
The late and infamous Madalyn Murray O’Hair comes first to mind here ; although she did some trailblazing legal work on behalf of church - state separation , her incendiary tirades against religion – and even against other atheists with whom she disagreed – probably breathed new life into this stereotype for an entire generation of religious apologists .
Although I doubt O’Hair was the inspiration for the “ atheists are angry ” straw man , she certainly helped to reinforce it .
And this type of behavior hurts the cause of atheism in general .
It detracts from our legitimacy and makes it that much easier for people to dismiss us as cranks with nothing worthwhile to say .
For this reason , I strongly recommend that atheists today repudiate her approach in no uncertain terms , and make it clear that her attitudes do not define or represent us .
As part of this , I further recommend that all atheists make a renewed effort to treat theists in a civil manner .
This is not to say we should refrain from criticism of religion , but rather that we should focus our criticisms on the beliefs themselves and not personally attack the people who hold them .
Of course , exceptions will have to be made for especially evil or obnoxious believers whose individual behavior truly does deserve condemnation .
While atheists cannot , by definition , be “ angry at God ” , there are some atheists who have phrased their arguments imprecisely , thus giving the wrong impression to believers who are not familiar with the intent behind atheological arguments .
For example , the argument from evil is often misinterpreted as the atheist ’s claiming that they are angry at God for allowing evil to happen , rather than recognizing its true purpose , which is to show that the existence of evil rules out the existence of a benevolent and omnipotent deity .
Again , it is important to be precise , especially when dealing with the wider society that is not already familiar with atheological arguments , so that we are not misunderstood .
An analogy may help enlighten theists who do not see how we can criticize religious beliefs without being religious ourselves .
One might watch Star Wars and consider Darth Vader to be a despicable and malevolent character , one who committed many evil deeds in the context of the movie .
But given that statement , does it follow that one “ hates Darth Vader ” ?
Applying that phrase without qualification would give an erroneous idea of a person ’s actual beliefs and perspectives on what is real and what is fictional .
We can condemn a moral outlook similar to Darth Vader ’s without believing that any such specific person actually exists , and this is a good metaphor for the way most atheists think about god -belief .
And if a large number of people sincerely believed that Darth Vader was real and were inspired by his example to commit similar evil acts , we might rightly feel angry at this idea that had brought about such suffering , without believing that the idea corresponds to anything in reality .
A participant in an Internet forum discussion phrased a similar idea quite well :
“ It is never the message , rather , it ’s the messengers that disturb me .
It ’s never Jehovah knocking on my door at dinner time with a little tract about Salvation in exchange for a love gift of $ 5 or whatever I can afford , nor is it Yahweh standing on the courtroom steps with His Rules in Stone bolted to public property , nor is it the Lord himself who shoots at medical doctors or bombs women ’s health clinics or torches congregations of Faithful in Waco .
Allah - in - the - flesh will never be found wearing a dynamite girdle in the middle of a Jewish shopping district , nor will Moroni ever be caught shaking - down 3rd world peasants for their last dime in the name of some polygamist god . ”
As this passage puts it , atheists are not , and cannot be , angry at a god we do not even believe in .
Beyond us there is nothing but the world of natural forces , and since these are not personified beings , it makes no sense to feel anger at them .
Rather , if we are angry , it is anger at the people who use their belief in such a god to justify violence , oppression , and denial of others ’ most basic rights , and who then have the audacity to tell us that we are the immoral ones because we do not share their beliefs .
If we are angry , it is not undirected or purposeless , but because we can see a brighter future lying ahead for humanity , and we are justifiably angered by those people who are standing in the way .
But that does not exclude us from also finding happiness in all the beauty , wonder , and love that can be found in this life .
With hope and resolution , but without purposeless or unnecessary anger , we atheists look forward to a future world where these pleasures are open to all humanity , without any distracting and darkening veils of superstition to occlude our sight .
A political row has erupted in Italy over whether state television should air a BBC documentary about the sexual abuse of children by Roman Catholic priests .
The dispute broke out after a conservative politician said the Italian broadcaster , RAI , should block the documentary because it was part of what he called ' a media execution squad ready to open fire on the Church and the Pope ' .
The head of the parliament 's oversight committee for the broadcaster , asked the Director General of RAI Claudio Cappon to deny permission to air ' Sex Crimes and the Vatican ' .
It was scheduled to be aired as part of a talk show ' Year Zero ' hosted by a progressive journalist , Michele Santoro .
The documentary was aired on the BBC in October but never in Italy , although bloggers have translated the programme and it now ranks as one of Italy 's most popular downloaded videos .
Several leftist politicians have attacked the request for censorship .
Italy 's powerful Roman Catholic Church has condemned the documentary .
At the weekend , a newspaper of the Italian bishops ' conference , accused bloggers who put the documentary on the web of spreading ' infamous slander ' .
The documentary examined what it described as secret Vatican documents setting out procedures to deal with general abuse of the confessional by a priest to silence his victim .
The original document , written in 1962 , was updated in 2001 to deal more specifically with paedophilia as the church around the world became embroiled in a string of sexual abuse scandals .
His birthday is October 1 , a day every Chinese person will celebrate .
He cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan and established diplomatic relations with People 's Republic of China .
His administration did n't fire a single bullet overseas .
He was awarded Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his contributions to world peace .
He is still surprisingly active both physically and spiritually at the age of nearly 83 .
He enjoys working in his peanut field .
He has so far written 21 books .
He is The New York Times ' best selling author .
His name is Jimmy Carter , the 39th President of the United States .
Recently he was interviewed in his office at the Carter Center in Atlanta by Yong Tang , a Washington - based correspondent of People 's Daily .
Jimmy Carter and Yong Tang ( R )
" I like the word competition better than confrontation "
Yong Tang :
You became American President five years after President Nixon first visited China .
However , since his visit in 1972 there was not much progress in bilateral relationship between Washington and Beijing .
What made you decided to normalize relationship with China ?
Carter : I first visited China in 1949 when I was a young naval officer .
It was a year when the Nationalist Chinese left Mainland China and went to Taiwan .
Then on October 1 , 1949 , my birthday , the People 's Republic of China was formed .
Yong Tang :
You have the same birthday with my country .
It was really a beautiful coincidence .
Carter : Yeah !
I was very excited and pleased when Nixon did go to China .
But I was disappointed when they announced there was only one China and did n't say which one .
As you know , the more conservative Americans , including particular Republicans , still looked upon Taiwan as the only China .
So when I became President , I thought it was time to make a change .
I saw the enormous need for better understanding , better communication , better friendship and cooperation with China .
So I decided that would be one of my goals as President .
So beginning in early 1978 , Deng Xiaoping and I had very secret negotiations .
I did n't even use the State Department .
All of the messages went from the White House directly to China .
I thought that it was one of the most needed diplomatic goals in my country 's life .
And I think it was the right thing to do and one of the best things I ever did .
Yong Tang :
As many researchers and biographers have suggested , your decision to establish diplomatic relationship with China was a very courageous one and hurt your relationship with the Congress .
What do you think of the significance of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and America ?
In the long run , how has the decision affected China and the entire world ?
Carter :
Well , it was proven to be one of the best things that ever happened to my country , and I think it has had a beneficial effect on China as well .
When I went over in 1981 to visit China as the guest of Deng Xiaoping , he wanted me to see the first phases of economic freedom moving toward a free enterprise .
And I think that may not have happened if we did n't have normal relations .
Also his establishment of the right of little villages to have local elections was another possible result of the normalization .
So I think that , in many ways , it has stabilized the political and military situation in the East , in Asia and also in several other countries .
Yong Tang : I know you are a close friend of Mr. Deng Xiaoping .
After the normalization announcement in December 1978 , Deng Xiaoping was invited by you to visit the United States .
You met him many times since his 1979 visit .
2007 is the 10th anniversary of his death .
Can you tell me your impression of Mr. Deng , his visit to the White House and your later meetings with him in China ?
Carter :
He was a strong man .
He was a great and wise man .
He was courageous .
And he was very honest and frank .
Yong Tang :
Also a very heavy smoker ?
Carter :
He was that .
That 's one thing that I did n't like .
( Laughs )
But when he told me something , I believed it to be true , and it was .
He never wavered in his commitment to achieve the normalization of relations , but also to accommodate some of the special political obstacles that I had to overcome dealing with Taiwan .
Yong Tang : I know that you have visited China many many times .
During those visits , you visited many places in China , met many Chinese leaders and talked to ordinary Chinese people .
What changes in China have impressed you most ?
Carter :
Well , the most remarkable changes in China have all been related to economic change .
I saw the original birth of free enterprise when Deng Xiaoping would only permit small farmers to have one tiny project : buy chickens or repair bicycles or make clay pots ; they could n't have two , only one .
And later he expanded that to villages , and then he expanded on up .
So that has been the primary change that I have seen and that has been impressive to me .
It has been profoundly noticeable to the whole world .
I would say that in the field of freedom , religious freedom , there has been great progress made .
I had an argument with him .
I requested that he permit freedom of religion and that he permit Bibles to come back into China .
I 'm a Christian , and he agreed to do both of those things and did them .
So in 1982 the Chinese National People 's Congress approved the guarantee of freedom of religion .
There are still some restraints on religion but progress has been made .
And when I first visited China after I left the White House , it was impossible for a person in China to move from one place to another , except if the government ordered him to .
Now there is more freedom of movement , more freedom of religion , and more economic freedom .
Yong Tang :
What do you think of the future of US - Sino relations ?
Do you think the US China relations will continue to profoundly impact the development of international regime ?
Carter :
My prayer and my hope are that the relation will always be friendly .
But I think there 's going to be more competition between China and the United States , which is already evident economically .
I have seen your Premier Wen Jiabao making great efforts in Latin America , Africa , and other places around the world to expand the diplomatic and economic relationships with those countries .
Some are in competition with the United States .
I think that 's healthy , but that shows what is going to happen in the future .
I think the competition between the United States and China is going to be increasingly important .
If we can maintain mutual respect and mutual trust , then that competition can be beneficial .
Yong Tang :
But some experts claim that a confrontation between China and America is unavoidable because of our huge differences in political systems and diplomatic priorities and Taiwan issues .
How do you think of that ?
Carter :
Well , I like the word competition better than confrontation .
You know , confrontation has the connation of possible military action .
I do n't believe that , with any degree of wisdom in Beijing or Washington , we are going to have a military confrontation .
But it is inevitable that we are going to be more competitive , even in space and military capabilities as well as economics and politics .
But if we retain our friendships then that competition can be peaceful and maybe mutually beneficial .
Yong Tang : I know The Carter Center was established in 1982 .
This year is the 25th anniversary of the Center .
Can you tell me what the initial goals in setting up the Center were ?
How have those goals changed over the years ?
What kind of role does the Center play in the world and especially in China ?
Carter :
Our original goal was to have a center here where I could negotiate peace agreements to avoid wars or to end existing civil wars .
Over time , we expanded our programs .
We have observed 67 elections in the world , including in Indonesia and Palestine and so forth .
And we work to prevent and eradicate diseases that are prevalent in poor countries .
Our operations are in more than 65 nations around the world , 35 in Africa .
For almost 10 years we have been invited by the government of China to come and help monitor the conduct of elections in small villages .
I 'll be back in China in November .
And my hope is that after the National People 's Congress sessions next year , The Carter Center will have opportunities to consider other areas of cooperation with China .
We 've had two other projects in China that were very important to me .
And I wanted to do something in China to show Deng Xiaoping my gratitude .
Deng Pufang , his son , crushed his spin when he was pushed out of a third story window in the Cultural Revolution .
I went to Deng Xiaopng and said what can The Carter Center do to help you ?
He gave me two projects .
One was to help build in China , for the first time , a factory to produce highly capable prosthetics , artificial arms and legs and so forth .
So we helped with that .
And the other one was to train teachers all over China to deal with children who were blind and deaf .
So those were two projects that we had in China , prior to our work with elections , when Deng Xiaoping was still around .
Yong Tang : I know you are known as the human rights President .
When you were at the White House , you promoted a foreign policy that placed human rights at the forefront .
This was a break from the policies of several predecessors , in which human rights abuses were often overlooked if they were committed by a nation that was allied with the United States .
The Carter Center continues to promote human rights worldwide .
In your view how do you strike a balance between national security and human rights ?
Carter :
When I became President , I announced that human rights would be the foundation of our foreign policy and the rights of individual human beings would be preeminentï¿½ï¿ ½freedom of speech , freedom of association , freedom of movement , freedom to choose one 's own government as well as social and economic rights such as the right of a human being to have a decent place to live , health care , and education .
So we did that when I was President .
I would say that the most obvious result has been the democratization of a number of countries .
For instance , when I became President , most of the Latin American countries were dictatorships .
They had military dictatorships in countries like Ecuador , Peru , Brazil , Argentina , Chile and Paraguay , and now they are all democracies .
One reason for that are the human rights policies I established .
There have been some changes made in governments around the world to promote human rights .
But I think also is more awareness that every human being has a right to decent place to live and to education , health care , and freedom .
I believe in the freedom to choose one 's own leaders , and freedom to worship .
" We can be that kind of superpower , a benevolent superpower "
Jimmy Carter receives interview from Yong Tang
Yong Tang : in your book Our Endangered Values : America 's Moral Crisis , you insist that foreign policy of the Bush administration is a failure .
How do you think of American foreign policy at the moment ?
Carter :
It 's still the same .
It 's still contrary to what all of President Bush 's predecessors did .
It 's different from what his father did .
It 's different from what Ronald Reagan did .
It 's different form what I did and what Bill Clinton did .
First , we now have the policy of preemptive war , and we 've never had this before .
We pretty well have abandoned all of the nuclear arms agreements we have conducted in the past .
We have tax policies in this country that reward rich people .
We have abandoned the Kyoto commitments to preserve the economy and the environment of the world .
We abandoned , in my opinion , the basic principles of human rights with the use of torture , imprisonment in Guantanamo , and a declaration that the Geneva Convention restraints on the treatment of prisoners no longer applies to us .
Those kinds of things have been very disturbing to me .
Yong Tang :
What are the major sources of all the above mentioned problems ?
What is the biggest mistake ?
Carter :
It 's a very complex subject , and I can't give you a brief answer .
But I think some of the people in Washington now believe in American hegemony in many parts of the world .
We have by far the strongest military power on Earth .
I think our defense budget is equal to all the other defense budgets in the world combined .
I think they saw that as a way to plant American presence and control in Iraq and other places around the world .
They wanted to do this without any international restraints from the United Nations or from existing treaties and laws .
I think this is a basic policy problem .
Yong Tang : in the same book , you said that you are glad that America has a strong defense , but size and physical prowess are n't the only attributes of a superpower .
They should also include " a demonstrable commitment to truth , justice , peace , freedom , humility , human rights , generosity and the upholding of other moral values " .
Which country in the history is qualified for a superpower with such attributes ?
Is it too idealistic ?
Carter : Yes , it is idealistic .
You have to go back in ancient times , say to the Roman Empires , to see a nation that was dominant in its area , because it did n't dominate China and they had some benevolent attributes .
I think that America , in the future , would have the capabilities of becoming such a Superpower .
You know , I was a military man , my training was in the military ; I was in the Navy force for 11 years .
Anyway , I had a strong defense , but I never dropped a bomb , we never launched a missile , we never fired a bullet .
Still we preserved our own security and peace with others .
Yong Tang : During your Administration ?
Carter :
Yes , that 's true .
And we still promoted human rights and peace and justice .
At that time we were not the only superpower in the world because we were about equal with our nuclear arsenals with the Soviet Union and China as well .
But now the United States is dominant , so far , in economics and military and so forth .
I think if our country adopts these principles , we can be that kind of superpower , a benevolent superpower .
" That 's the most accurate word that describes what 's going on in Palestine "
Yong Tang : Your latest book , Palestine : Peace Not Apartheid , was published in December 2006 .
You believe that " Israel 's continued control and colonization of Palestinian land have been the primary obstacles to a comprehensive peace agreement in the Holy Land " .
The book has created considerable controversy , especially for the use of the word apartheid in the title and throughout the book .
You defended your argument during a lecture at George Washington University .
I attended that lecture personally .
Why do you want to write this book and how do you justify the use of the word apartheid ?
Carter : Because that 's the most accurate word that describes what 's going on in Palestine .
Apartheid is when two different people live in the same area , and they are forcibly separated and one of the people dominates and persecutes the other .
That 's what 's happening in Palestine and that 's what apartheid is .
I wrote the book for two reasons .
One is to publicize , or reveal , the terrible plight of the Palestinians ; how they are being abused and persecuted .
And second , to try to give new light to the peace process in the Middle East ; it 's now dead .
We have n't had a single day of peace talks in more than six years , and I hope that my book will instigate some attention of the world to the plight of the Palestinians and help promote a new light for the peace talks .
Yong Tang : Did you anticipate such a strong response from the Jewish communities here ?
Carter :
My private mail from Jews and others has been positive .
But it 's impossible almost , in this country , for a Jewish American to criticize the government in Israel .
But they know that what I say is accurate , and they want to see peace talks start again , but they can't criticize the policies of the government , even when they disagree with those policies .
Yong Tang :
Why can't they ?
Carter : A small percentage of the Jewish community in America , probably one percent of the total population , feel that for them to criticize the Jewish government in Israel is not appropriate .
It is criticized severely in Jerusalem ; in the Parliament , in the public forums , in the news media , and so forth .
In fact , their preeminent newspaper there is Haaretz , and Haaretz 's editorial page uses the word apartheid to describe the situation .
Prominent members of their government , including former attorney general and the three different prime ministers also use the word apartheid .
And the number one human rights organization , Bethselem , also refers to apartheid .
So it 's a common thing in Israel , but in the United States it 's just not an acceptable thing to do .
" Before I go into a sensitive political area of the world I get permission from the White House "
Yong Tang : I know you were born on a peanut farm in Georgia .
Right ?
Carter : Yes .
Yong Tang : Like Bill Clinton , you started from scratch and you are not a rich President .
Political analysts say it is becoming more and more difficult in America to run for presidency if you do n't have enough money .
Is that true ?
Carter :
Yes , yes it is .
It 's bad , it 's true and bad .
I did n't have any money when I ran for president .
Yong Tang :
One example of American Dream is that every child born on a small farm may become American President someday .
Your experience is typically the fulfillment of that American Dream .
Some American people are quite proud of that .
Carter :
That 's gone now .
Now people that can have a chance to be the nominee of Democratic or Republican Party are those who can raise , in advance , a hundred million dollars , because the laws have changed in the last 25 years since I ran for president .
Now , very rich people and powerful corporations and others can give money to the candidates to finance their campaign .
I think it 's unfortunate but it 's true .
We will never know how many potentially wonderful presidents never have a chance now because they can't or wo n't adopt a policy of raising enormous sums of money .
Yong Tang :
Do you think America will do something to change that unfortunate election politics so that poor but capable persons can still run for presidency ?
Carter : I do n't know .
I hope so .
But right now the Republican Party is dominate in our country , in the White House and in the Supreme Court , and has a very conservative philosophy .
They think that anybody that has money ought to have a legal right to invest it in future candidates for Congress and also the presidency .
Yong Tang :
My readers very much want to know how a president lives in the White House .
Does American president have any kind of extra benefit except the salary ?
Carter : ( Laughs )
You do n't get much salary as a President !
Yong Tang : I know the annual salary for President at your time was about 200,000 dollars , now that has increased to 400,000 dollars .
Did you need to pay everything at your own expense when you were in White House ?
Carter :
You have to pay for food and all that .
Well , the White House is very large , and two of our sons and one of our daughters lived there with us .
One of them attended and graduated from George Washington University .
Inside the White House grounds , there is a swimming pool and a bowling alley .
We also had Camp David , which is a good resort area 35 minutes by helicopter from the White House , so we could go to Camp David on the weekends .
So there was a lot of recreation ; and I took a lot of exercise .
I enjoyed being the President .
Yong Tang :
How was the benefit changed when you retired ?
Carter : I get the same retirement pay that a member of Congress gets , so every time Congress raises their salary , I get more benefits .
But all my other income since I left the White House has been from my books .
I do n't receive any money from The Carter Center ; in fact , I give money to The Carter Center .
So my income is primarily from the books that I write ; I 've written 21 books .
Yong Tang : Does the White House have any restrictions on what a former president can say or do ?
You went to a lot of sensitive areas including North Korea , Cuba and somewhere in the Middleeast .
In 1994 , you went to North Korea and met with North Korean President Kim Il Sung , resulting in the signing of the Agreed Framework .
You visited Cuba in May 2002 and met with Fidel Castro
This made you the first President of the United States , in or out of office , to visit the island since the Cuban revolution of 1959 .
Did you need to get approved by the White House before you went to those areas ?
Carter : I 've always gotten approval from the White House .
Sometimes it 's very reluctant approval .
But I have made a policy that is voluntary on my part that before I go into a sensitive political area of the world I get permission from the White House .
Yong Tang : I know you are a strong critic of Bush administration .
Do you think the government is listening whenever you are criticizing and making recommendations ?
Carter :
Well , yes .
When I write a book or write an editorial for the New York Times , or the Washington Post , or Time magazine , or Newsweek magazine , I 'm sure they read what I say .
I also write personal letters to the President .
Every time when I make a trip overseas for the last 25 years , when I return home I have sent a trip report to the President and also to the Secretary of State .
And I send a copy of it to the Secretary General of the United Nations , so they always know what I have done overseas as soon as I get back .
Yong Tang : From a young age , you showed a deep commitment to Christianity , serving as a Sunday School teacher throughout your political career .
Even as President , you prayed several times a day , and professed that Jesus Christ was the driving force in your life .
Today you still pray everyday and teach Sunday School every Sunday ?
Why are you so committed to Christianity ?
Carter :
Yes , I still pray everyday , and I teach Sunday School every Sunday , because it 's been the foundation of my beliefs .
When I describe what a good superpower ought to be , those are the characteristics of Jesus Christ whom I worship .
We call him the Prince of Peace , so I worship the Prince of Peace , not war .
He believed in humility and service and forgiveness and love and alleviation of suffering , so those characteristics of a human being are compatible with the demonstrative life of Jesus Christ .
This is the most important foundation of all of my social and moral and ethical values .
Yong Tang : George Bush also said he is very faithful to Christianity .
When asked about why he declared war against Iraq , he answered that it is the order from God .
Carter : I am not sure that is exactly what he said .
But I do n't doubt his faith .
I would n't comment on that .
" I was in my peanut field yesterday "
Yong Tang : I know when you retire , you are doing a lot of different things .
In addition to the work at the Carter Center , you are a University Distinguished Professor at Emory University and teach occasional classes there .
You also teach a Sunday School class at Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains , Georgia .
Being an accomplished amateur woodworker , you have occasionally been featured in the pages of Fine Wood Working magazine .
You and your wife are also well - known for your work with Habitat for Humanity , a program that helps poor people to afford their first home .
You also write books and paint pictures .
You have so many things to do .
It is really amazing !
How do you manage such a tight schedule at such an old age ?
Carter :
Well , you know the people that arranged for this meeting , they arrange my life too .
( Laughs )
I tell them what I want to do , and they find the time and a place for me to do it .
I have a very relaxed and easygoing life .
We still live in the place where I was born , in Plains , Ga .
My wife and I both came from this little town .
Just 635 people in the whole town ; 60 percent of them are black people .
We still claim land that my father , my grandfather , and my great - grandfather owned .
Yong Tang :
So you are still a farmer ?
Carter : Yes .
I was in my peanut field yesterday ; I have my roots there .
But we have a very exciting life , an adventurous , unpredictable life .
Yong Tang :
Do you think a president should learn from you when he retires ?
Carter : Each retired President has his own life to live .

Scientists at the University of Chicago and the National Museum of Natural History in Washington , D.C. , have produced new evidence to finally resolve the mysterious identity of what they regard as one of the weirdest organisms that ever lived .
Their chemical analysis indicates that the organism was a fungus , the scientists report in the May issue of the journal of Geology , published by the Geological Society of America .
Called Prototaxites ( pronounced pro-toe - tax - eye - tees ) , the organism went extinct approximately 350 million years ago .
Prototaxites has generated controversy for more than a century .
Originally classified as a conifer , scientists later argued that it was instead a lichen , various types of algae or a fungus .
Whatever it was , it stood in tree - like trunks more than 20 feet tall , making it the largest - known organism on land in its day .
" No matter what argument you put forth , people say , well , that 's crazy .
That does n't make any sense , " said C. Kevin Boyce , an Assistant Professor in Geophysical Sciences at Chicago .
" A 20 - foot - tall fungus does n't make any sense .
Neither does a 20 - foot - tall algae make any sense , but here 's the fossil . "
The Geology paper adds a new line of evidence indicating that the organism is a fungus .
The fungus classification first emerged in 1919 , with Francis Hueber of the National Museum of Natural History in Washington , D.C. , reviving the idea in 2001 .
His detailed studies of internal structure have provided the strongest anatomical evidence that Prototaxites is not a plant , but a fungus .
" Fran Hueber has contributed more to our understanding of Prototaxites than anyone else , living or dead , " said Carol Hotton , also of the National Museum of Natural History .
" He built up a convincing case based on the internal structure of the beast that it was a giant fungus , but agonized over the fact that he was never able to find a smoking gun in the form of reproductive structures that would convince the world that it was indeed a fungus , " Hotton said .

Prototaxites lived worldwide from approximately 420 million to 350 million years ago .
During this period , which spans part of the Silurian and Devonian periods of geologic time , terrestrial Earth looked quite alien in comparison to the modern world .
Simple vascular plants , the ancestors of the familiar conifers , ferns and flowering plants of today , began to diversify on land during the Devonian Period .
" Initially , they 're just stems .
They do n't have roots .
They do n't have leaves .
They do n't have anything like that , " Boyce said .
Millipedes , wingless insects and worms were among the other organisms making a living on land by then , but no backboned animals had yet evolved out of the oceans .
" That world was a very strange place , " Boyce said .
Although vascular plants had established themselves on land 40 million years before the appearance of Prototaxites , the tallest among them stood no more than a couple feet high .
By the end of the Devonian , approximately 345 million years ago , large trees , ferns , seeds , leaves and roots had all evolved .
" They 're all there .
They just exploded over this one time period , " Boyce said .
Canadian paleontologist Charles Dawson published the first research on Prototaxites in 1859 , based on specimens found along the shores of Gaspé Bay in Quebec , Canada .
Hueber pored through Dawson 's field notebooks , written " in a completely illegible scrawl , " Hotton said .

" Fran spent months deciphering them for clues about the localities where specimens had been collected , how Dawson interpreted them and other information that helped understand this humongous fungus , " she said .
Hueber also traveled to Canada , Australia and Saudi Arabia to collect specimens .
He tediously sliced them into hundreds of thin sections and made thousands of images taken through microscopes to determine the organism 's identity .
Now Boyce , Hotton and their colleagues have produced independent evidence that supports Hueber 's case .
The team did so by analyzing two varieties -- isotopes - - of carbon contained in Prototaxites and the plants that lived in the same environment approximately 400 million years ago .
The metabolism of plants is limited by photosynthesis .
Deriving their energy from the sun and their carbon from carbon dioxide in the air , any given type of plant will typically contain a similar ratio of carbon - 12 to carbon - 13 as another plant of the same type .
" But if you 're an animal , you will look like whatever you eat , " Boyce said .
And Prototaxites displayed a much wider variation in its ratio of carbon - 12 to carbon - 13 content than would be expected in any plant .
Geological processes can alter the isotopic composition of fossils , but Boyce and his colleagues conducted tests to verify that the carbon isotopic composition of the specimens they analyzed stemmed from organic rather than geologic factors .
As for why these bizarre organisms grew so large , " I 've wondered whether it enabled Prototaxites to distribute its spores widely , allowing it to occupy suitable marshy habitats that may have been patchily distributed on the landscape , " Hotton said .
The relatively simple Devonian ecosystems certainly seemed to contain nothing to prevent them from growing slowly for a long time .
Plant - eating animals had not yet evolved , Boyce said .
But even if Prototaxites had n't been eaten by the dinosaurs and elephants that came much later , they probably grew too slowly to rebuild from regular disturbances of any kind , Boyce said .
" It 's hard to imagine these things surviving in the modern world , " he said .
Co-authoring the Geology paper with Boyce , Hotton and Hueber himself were Marilyn Fogel , George Cody and Robert Hazen of the Carnegie Institution of Washington , and Andrew Knoll of Harvard University .
Their work was funded by NASA 's Astrobiology Institute and by the American Chemical Society Petroleum Fund .
New developments are producing to ever more accurate time technologies
Researchers used short pulses of laser light to produce images of electrons leaving atoms and recorded what happened to within 100 attoseconds .
To imagine how long this is , if 100 attoseconds is stretched so that it lasts one second , one second would last 300 million years on the same scale .
Scientists used the technique to record the dynamics of electrons in atoms and report their findings in Nature .
The research team employed extreme ultraviolet ( XUV ) light pulses to excite atoms , prompting them to emit electrons , the small negatively charged particles that are a fundamental part of every atom .
" We accelerate the electrons spinning around the nucleus .
Some pick up so much energy that they leave the atoms forever , " Professor Ferenc Krausz , of the Technische Universitat Wien , in Austria , told BBC News Online .
Future clocks
At the same time , the scientists used a device called a Few - Cycle Laser to capture " tomographic images " of these electrons that gave information about how they behaved with time .
This allowed the scientists to distinguish events within 100 attoseconds , the shortest interval of time ever recorded .
THE ATTOSECOND
An attosecond is one quintillionth ( 10 to the power of minus 18 ) of a second Caesium atomic clocks are accurate to one second over many millions of years
The development of laser counters will push clocks to theoretical billion - year accuracy The clocks ' technology will be used in telecommunications and experiments testing fundamental theories in physics
They will also be used to time important processes in biologocal cells , to aid our understanding of disease
Existing atomic clocks are very accurate and measure time by counting the number of times caesium atoms jump back and forth between different energy levels .
These jumps , or " ticks " , occur at microwave frequencies .
But researchers are increasingly looking to count ticks using optical frequencies , with the help of lasers .
This would offer the prospect of more stable and therefore more accurate clocks .
" The more stable the clock , the better you can measure time , " said Dale Henderson of the UK's National Physical Laboratory .
Brixton Fish Market gets its stock from as far away as Senegal
Brixton Fish Market is , as ever , doing a brisk mid-afternoon trade .
An unremitting flow of shoppers , laden with groceries from nearby fruit and veg stands , file in to pick up their weekly fish supply .
They choose from a bewildering array of stock , some more appealing than others .
Prehistoric - looking pomfret and oily catfish nestle amid neon - red " strawberry " groupers and blue - streaked parrot fish .
The market caters almost exclusively to Brixton 's diverse African , Caribbean and Portuguese communities .
' Wonderful fish '
But campaigners hope more and more people in Britain will start to sample the types of fish it sells rather than opt for " traditional " varieties including cod , plaice and haddock .
The market has not sold cod since the price of the threatened fish rocketed , explains market manager Sajjad Ghaffar .
The pomfret could be eaten instead of cod
" Cod is too expensive now and our customers are used to eating all manner of fish from their homelands anyway , " he said .
" The fish we sell tastes wonderful .
Some of it is much more tasty than traditional European fish .
" People need to start trying it out and being adventurous .
Why not have a pomfret with your chips ?
" We have lots of alternatives to cod .
Our pollack is cheaper and just as good . "
Depleted stocks
The price of cod in the UK has risen in recent years as stocks have diminished .
The Marine Conservation Society is asking people to avoid buying cod , halibut , hake , monkfish and plaice from areas where stocks are deemed to be overfished .
Last month Asda announced it was to stop selling monkfish amid concerns over depleting stocks and the way it was being fished .
Sajjad Ghaffar said his fish was tastier than European varieties
The Marine Stewardship Council , which works to safeguard the world 's seafood supply , is urging people to buy fish bearing its blue " eco-label " , which indicates products sustainably fished .
The call was backed by Nadine Edwards , 31 , originally from Jamaica , who was buying several snappers in Brixton Fish Market ahead of a dinner party .
" People just need to branch out and try new things , " she said .
" I know people go for what they know but there are lots and lots of different types of fish out there which are just gorgeous . "
' Cod could be gone '
But around the corner at LS Marsh & Sons fishmongers , which has been trading since 1932 , Ian Marsh said he was not sure people would stray from what they knew .
" People like to eat what they know and they know cod and traditional fish , " he said .
Ian Marsh said cod could be extinct in 10 to 15 years
" I think the thing that puts people off cod more than anything is the price .
It 's gone up hugely in the time I 've been in the business .
" I think if people do n't do something soon cod will be gone within 10 to 15 years really . "
He added that people could buy whiting or lemon sole as traditional alternatives to the endangered fish .
Brixton shoppers said a labelling scheme which explained what the more unusual fish tasted like and which gave cooking suggestions would help .
Barbara Andrauit , 27 , and David Beaulieu , 29 , both from France , bought £ 19 - worth of cod from Mr Marsh for a dinner party .
" We bought it because we know what it 's like , " Barbara said .
Barbara Andrauit said she would consider buying unusual fish
" Some of the other fish just looks ugly and unappealing .
At least we know what we 're getting .
" But if I knew what other fish was like I would consider buying it .
If there was more information . "
Others , however , said they would be less happy to try new varieties of fish .
Eyeing the fish on offer in Brixton Fish Market suspiciously , Dennis McCann , 52 , said : " It all looks a bit to foreign to me .
" I like fish and chips and I like a good cod or plaice .
I just can't imagine having pomfret and chips . "

The vast freshwater ecosystem of the Amazon River is home to abundant animal life , and many of its species thrive by virtue of their ferocity .
If one were to ask the locals which of the river ’s indigenous species is the most treacherous , a few might describe the roaming packs of carnivorous piranhas , or the massive anaconda snakes ; but based on the general sentiment of the region , the most frequently uttered response would be “ candirú . ”
The candirú is a tiny catfish which dwells in the depths of the Amazon River .
These fish do not hunt in packs like the piranha , nor are they exceptionally large like the anaconda .
In fact , the candirú is among the tiniest vertebrates on the planet , and it is sometimes referred to as the “ toothpick fish ” due to its small size and slender shape .
Only a handful of people have had the misfortune of crossing paths with the candirú , but their experiences serve as cautionary tales to any who venture into the mighty river .
Though the candirú is a parasite , humans are not among its viable hosts .
It lingers in the murky darkness at the river ’s bottom , quietly stalking its neighboring fish .
Light is scarce in the soupy deep , but the candirú does not need to see… it can taste the traces of urea and ammonia that are expelled from breathing gills .
The tiny hunter shadows its prey , almost invisible due to its translucent body and small size .
When the target fish exhales , the candirú detects the resulting flow of water and makes a dash for the exposed gill cavity with remarkable speed .
Within less than a second it penetrates the gill and wriggles its way into place , erecting an umbrella - like array of spines to secure its position .
A candirú attached to a host fish
Unconcerned with the host ’s panicked thrashing , the firmly anchored parasite immediately nibbles a hole in a nearby artery with its needle - like teeth , feasting upon the bounty that gushes forth .
Within two minutes the candirú ’s belly is swollen with the blood of its victim , and it retracts its gripping barbs .
Though it may seem that the exploited host fish has escaped , its injuries are so extensive that chances of survival are grim .
Meanwhile the victorious attacker slinks back into the river ’s dark places to digest its meal .
There are many troubling stories from the region regarding human run-ins with the candirú .
It is not uncommon for people swimming or bathing in the river to urinate while in the water , an action which creates tiny water currents that are rich in urea and ammonia , much like an exhaling fish .
The story goes that the tiny , slender catfish cannot always distinguish a urinating human from an exhaling fish gill , and on occasion it will attempt its trademark high - speed attack on some unfortunate soul ’s submerged , exposed urethra .
Silvio Barbossa was allegedly one such soul .
He was swimming in the Amazon River when he claims he went head to head with the tiny parasite :
“ I felt like urinating .
I stood up , and it was then it attacked me .
The candirú attacked me . [ … ]
When I saw it , I was terrified .
I grabbed it quickly so it could n’t go deeper inside .
I could only see the end of its tail flapping .
I tried to grab it , but it slipped away from me and went in . [… ]
I was very afraid , because the candirú bites . ”
According to claimed victims , when the candirú successfully invades a human , it proceeds exactly as it would with a fish host .
After entering the misidentified orifice , it quickly wriggles its way in as far as possible , often accompanied by the victim ’s frantic attempts to grip the slippery , mucus - coated tail .
In the unlikely event that the panicked victim manages to grasp the fish , its backwards - pointing barbs would cause excruciating pain at each pull , and bring a quick end to the dramatic tug - of - war .
Once inside , the parasite inches its way up the urethra to the nearest blood - gorged membrane , extends its spines into the surrounding tissue , and starts feasting .
For the candirú , this misguided journey would be a one - way trip ; its bloody banquet leaves it too swollen to escape .
The only known retaliation against the invader would be delicate and expensive surgery , or failing that , a folk remedy which combines two herbs in a desperate gambit to slowly kill and dissolve the fish .
Silvio was reportedly fortunate enough to have access to modern medical facilities , though he had to endure three days of profound agony before the fish was extracted by an awestruck urogenital surgeon .
Verified reports of candirú attacks upon human genitalia are scarce , and in general , the risk is not given much credence by the medical community .
And , despite reports to the contrary , it is certainly impossible for the fish to swim up a stream of urine originating from above the waterline .
In short , if one urinates in the Amazon while their genitalia is submerged and exposed , the risk is elevated from impossible to ridiculously improbable .
DO NOT BACK UP , SEVERE URETHRA DAMAGE
Silvio ’s incident was the first semi-credible report of a candirú attacking a human , but such leg - crossingly horrific tales have haunted the region for generations .
According to legend , many men chose castration as an alternative to a slow , excruciating death back before surgery was an option .
Though such brushes with the candirú are vanishingly rare in statistical terms , it is wise to heed the advice of the locals , and avoid urinating in the Amazon River at all costs .
When the natives of the Amazon speak , one would be foolish not to listen .
They are privy to some of the world ’s most horrible truths .

Just a few weeks ago , the biggest worry for Pete V. Domenici — New Mexico ’s longest - serving senator ever and “ godfather ” of the state Republican Party — was convincing voters he intended to run next year for a seventh term .
But the sudden eruption of what might be the biggest controversy of Domenici ’s political career — involving reports that he tried to pressure a federal prosecutor to speed up a corruption probe of a prominent Democrat during last year ’s midterm election campaign — has put Domenici ’s legacy in doubt and could drastically alter New Mexico ’s political landscape .
Domenici is dealing with allegations that he and another New Mexico Republican , Rep. Heather A. Wilson , pressured U.S. Attorney David C. Iglesias in late October to produce an anticipated indictment of former New Mexico Senate President Manny Aragon .
The fact that Iglesias was one of eight U.S. attorneys fired by the Bush administration after the 2006 elections has added fuel to the political brush fire .
Critics contend that Wilson was looking for a boost during the toughest race of her career , a contest with Democratic state Attorney General Patricia Madrid that Wilson ended up winning by 861 votes .
A timeline presented by Iglesias , according to political blogger Heath Haussamen , placed a call he received from Wilson in October as coming shortly after the second of four polls showed her trailing in the race .
Domenici ’s calls , according to Iglesias ’ recollection , came about four days after a fourth poll showed Wilson losing .
Both Domenici and Wilson have not denied making the calls but say they were not meant to intimidate or influence Iglesias .
Domenici issued a statement on March 4 apologizing for his call , while Wilson said in a March 6 statement that her call was not “ motivated by politics or partisanship . ”
New Mexico is an almost evenly split partisan “ battleground ” state that has a Democratic governor ( Bill Richardson ) , a Democratic senator ( Jeff Bingaman ) who has long been paired with Republican Domenici , and a House delegation in which Wilson is joined by Republican Steve Pearce and Democrat Tom Udall .
New Mexico was a swing state in the past two presidential elections , giving President Bush a 1 percentage - point margin in 2004 and Democrat Al Gore a razor - thin edge in 2000 .
So a political flap of this magnitude has at least the potential to tip the partisan balance .
Most politicos both in state and in Washington and on both sides of the aisle agree that if Domenici wants another term , it ’s his for the taking — as long as the controversy does not blow up into a full - blown scandal .
But this unexpected trouble raises new questions about whether Domenici — who recently appeared to bat down retirement rumors by launching a fundraising effort for a 2008 campaign — is certain to run again next year at age 76 for a seat he first won in 1972 when he was 40 .
If any incumbent would have a cushion of public sympathy , it would be Domenici .
After relatively close races his first two times out , he won his next four contests by margins ranging from 30 percentage points ( over Democrat Gloria Tristani in 2002 ) to 46 points ( over Democrat Tom R. Benavides in 1990 ) .
Fundraising also has never been a problem for the popular incumbent , who spent $ 4.1 million in 2002 for a 5 - to - 1 ratio over Tristani .
Given these stats , “ it would take something a lot more dramatic than this to threaten [ Domenici ’s ] viability , ” said Albuquerque pollster Brian Sanderoff .
But that might not be as true for Wilson , who has been groomed by the Republican Party as Domenici ’s heir apparent but has endured several close races — including the 2006 nail biter — in the politically competitive , Albuquerque - based 1st District .
Domenici massaged the way for Wilson to win the 1st District seat in the March 1998 special election necessitated by the death of Republican Rep. Steven H. Schiff .
Wilson , then 40 years old and a member of then - GOP Gov. Gary E. Johnson ’s Cabinet , won the short - term contest — though with 44.5 percent of the vote and a 5 - point margin over Democrat Phillip J. Maloof , as a Green Party candidate pulled down nearly 15 percent — then won a full term that November by 7 points .
But Wilson , even after wins of 11 points in 2002 and 9 points in 2004 , has not been able to rest comfortably in the 1st , and she endured a political bruising in the 2006 election that is now again the focus of attention .
Among those paying attention is a Democrat who many in his party would like to see challenge Wilson in 2008 , but who has explicitly ruled out doing so : Albuquerque Mayor Martin Chavez .
While Chavez has said he would not challenge Domenici , he is considered a strong contender for the Democratic Senate nomination should Domenici reverse himself and retire .
Nonetheless , Chavez had some choice words for the 1st District incumbent , saying , “ Heather Wilson will no longer be elected in New Mexico , ” and calling Wilson ’s actions “ reprehensible . ”

Income Distribution Heresies
In a recent paper published by the Cato Institute , I made the seemingly heretical observation that inequality in incomes , wages , consumption , and wealth among the U.S. population as a whole does not appear to have increased significantly since 1988 .
My Cato paper was condensed and revised from a paper I presented at the Western Economics Association ( WEA ) last July .
That WEA paper , in turn , was condensed and revised from Chapter 5 in my book Income and Wealth , written early last year as part of a series of college textbooks for Greenwood Press .
Income and Wealth did not say that U.S. inequality probably stopped rising after 1988 .
That thesis arrived much later , and tentatively , in two pages of the Cato paper .
My book ’s tutorial is about avoiding common statistical pitfalls involved with measuring the growth of average wages and incomes over time , the division of income between labor and capital , the concepts of mobility and lifetime incomes , the concentration of wealth ownership , etc .
Early chapters explain why inequality might be expected to increase over time , because I too had initially assumed the “ professional consensus ” asserting an ongoing increase in inequality was an adequate substitute for facts .
I have been bemused by the emotional , non-factual responses at various blogs to my inability to discover any evidence of a “ significant and sustained ” rise of inequality since 1988 .
By “ significant ” I mean to exclude the .003 increase in the Gini index for pretax money income between 2001 and 2005 that Brookings ’ Gary Burtless mentioned .
Oxford University economist Anthony Atkinson suggests the Gini coefficient must rise by 3 percentage points in order to be considered a significant new trend .
By “ sustained , ” I mean to exclude the tax - induced spike in capital gains realizations in 1986 , the 1993 break in Census Bureau data , and the Internet stock euphoria of 1997 - 2000 .
Surveying the Evidence
My heretical claim did not originate with me .
My Cato paper cited the following evidence :
Card and DiNardo found that wage inequality did not increase from 1988 to 2000 .
Johnson , Smeeding and Torrey found that a Gini coefficient for a broad measure of consumption , from the Survey of Consumer Finances , fell slightly from 0.283 in 1986 to 0.280 in 2002 .
Kopczuk and Saez found that the top shares of wealth were stable during the 1990s .
The top 1 percent ’s share of wealth was also stable from 1995 to 2004 , according to more recent estimates from Arthur Kennickell .
Unless these scholars have erred , that takes care of wages , wealth , and consumption .
And it does so without even mentioning the Consumer Expenditure Survey , which I am supposedly enamored of , according to Gary Burtless .
What about disposable ( after - tax ) income ?
Last November , a study by Burkhauser , Oshio and Rovba found that , “ For the United States … real mean household size - adjusted after - tax income increased by 10.93 percent over the 1980s and by 7.27 percent over the 1990s while median after - tax income increased by 5.95 percent and 7.10 percent respectively over these periods …
[ But ] income inequality rose substantially over the business cycle of the 1980s whether measured by the 90/10 ratio ( 23.67 percent ) or by the Gini coefficient ( 14.17 percent ) .
In contrast , income inequality fell over the 1990s business cycle [ 1989 to 2000 ] whether measured by the 90/10 ratio ( - 6.82 percent ) or the Gini coefficient ( - 2.24 percent ) . ”
From 1989 to 2000 , they added , “ the confluence of significant economic growth and work - based welfare reforms dramatically improved the employment and economic well - being of single women with children relative to the rest of the population and more generally did so for lower - skilled workers . ” [ 1 ]
The aforementioned 90/10 ratios , incidentally , compared incomes between the highest and lowest deciles of full - time workers .
The ratio was 6.9 % in 1987 - 90 and 6.7 % in 2003 - 2004 , which lends support to the Card - DiNardo finding that wage inequality did not increase even between polar extremes .
I have discovered great resistance to this message , particularly from conservative economists .
One reason appears to be a common misunderstanding about the assumed link between incomes and work .
CEA Chairman Edward P. Lazear says , “ There is little doubt that there has been a 25 - year trend of a growing gap , sometimes called income inequality , between the wages of the skilled and the unskilled . ”
Despite the absence of doubt , Lazear ’s assertion is clearly inconsistent with the research of Burkhauser , Oshio and Rovba , Card and DiNardo and others .
But I am far more troubled by his conceptual muddling of skill gaps and inequality .
An accompanying graph does not clearly show median hourly earnings for college grads growing faster than those with less schooling from 1989 to 1996 or from 2001 to 2004 .
But even if there was such a sustained trend , a growing gap between wages of college graduates and high - school dropouts would necessarily translate into increased income inequality only if : ( 1 ) everyone worked full - time all year , and ( 2 ) all income came from work , and ( 3 ) college graduates were not a rising share of the labor force and native high - school dropouts a declining share .
The number of people who worked full - time all year in 2005 amounted to only 3.2 million in the poorest fifth of households but 16.7 million in the top quintile .
There are many more singles in the lower income groups ( including students and widows ) , and many more mature two - earner couples at the top .
The top quintile – every couple with a pretax income above $ 91,705 – accounted for 29.1 percent of all full - time , year - round workers , which is the largest single reason they received 40 % of disposable income in 2004 [ xls ] .
The top quintile also had more college grads , but that only affects market income if they work . [ 2 ]
Economists who try to explain most difference in household income by hourly wages are ignoring the huge differences in the number of hours worked per household .
They are also ignoring transfer payments , most of which ( except the EITC ) are effectively limited to those who work little or not at all .
Other economists attempt to dismiss the Card - DiNardo conclusion by referring to the top 1 percent ’s share of W2 income .
First , let me make a general objection .
We will never discover anything about the distribution of income among all or even most Americans by looking at only 1 percent of the tax - paying population .
We gather no information about what is happening to living standards of the poor or the ( typically undefined ) “ middle class ” by examining only the upper tail of the income distribution .
Pretending to describe the income distribution by using only the share of income going to the top 1 % makes no more sense than doing the same with the incomes of the bottom 1 % .
Except under extreme zero-sum reasoning ( arguing that an extra billion for Steve Jobs means a billion less for others ) , the top 1 % fetish is essentially irrelevant .
Even if you insist on focusing on the top 1 % , it is particularly misleading to compare – as Piketty and Saez do in their widely cited study – income reported on tax returns in two years ( 1980 and 2004 ) that fall before and after the 1986 Tax Reform Act .
In the Piketty - Saez estimates of W2 labor income , the top centile ’s share suddenly increased from 7.3 % in 1986 to 9.4 % in 1988 and then averaged 9.1 % from 1988 through 1996 .
That is quite consistent with the reasonable estimates of elasticity of taxable income cited in my December 14th Wall Street Journal op - ed , and not with Piketty and Saez ’s subsequent disavowal of Saez ’s own estimates .
Using the Social Security data that Burtless cites , Schwabish finds [ pdf ] “ the share of earnings at the top of the distribution … has fallen precipitously ” from 2000 to 2003 .
My Cato paper showed that is also true of CEO pay .
Both rebounded in 2004 because more than 11 % of SCF respondents reported receiving stock options in 2001 [ pdf ] — reported on W2 ’s when exercised , and first exercisable in 2004 .
That , too , is a predictable response to lower tax rates , and executives accounted for only a fourth of option grants by 1999 [ pdf ] .
Statistical Mirages
My Cato paper compared the 20.7 % real increase in top decile pay from 1979 to 2004 with the 21 % increase in bottom quintile pay , using median income from the Survey of Consumer Finances .
Not interesting ?
Critics prefer to focus on defects in Census Bureau data which , Burtless suggests , I am either unaware of or reluctant to reveal .
For example , my Cato paper compared the Census Bureau estimate of the income share of the top 5 % with that of Piketty and Saez .
The Census figure rose from 18 % in 1986 to 20.9 % in 2004 , mostly because of a data break in 1993 .
The comparable Piketty - Saez figure jumped from 22.6 % in 1986 to 27 % in 1988 , which I attribute to the 1986 Tax Reform and so did Piketty and Saez until recently .
Their measure of the top 5 percent ’s share of income ( as they define it ) hit 31.2 % by 2004 .
Paul Krugman and others were a bit too quick to blame sample size and top coding of Census data .
Even when we exclude all income above $ 5 million from the Piketty - Saez estimate of the top 5 percent ’s share , that would narrow the gap by only 0.9 % leaving nine percentage points unexplained .
The fact that Census includes cash transfer payments in total income is also not nearly enough to begin to fill the gap .
My Cato paper also cited the Census Bureau ’s Gini coefficient for their broad ( 14th ) definition of disposable income , which subtracts income and payroll taxes , adds cash and in - kind transfer payments , and ( unfortunately ) also adds capital gains that show up on tax returns .
This is the measure Burtless approves of yet does not disclose .
The Gini coefficient for disposable income can be rounded to 0.38 or 0.39 for all but one year between 1984 and 1992 , meaning it was essentially unchanged .
It briefly jumped to 0.41 in 1986 for just one year , but that was clearly due to a rush to sell assets before the capital gains tax went up .
The index was identical in 1985 , 1988 and 1992 , at 0.385 .
In 1993 , when the Census survey methods were computerized and “ top- coding ” limits hugely increased , the Gini suddenly leaps to 0.40 in 1993 where it remained in 2004 , following a brief rise to .41 when capital gains boomed in 1999 - 2000 .
In order to pretend to see any sustained upward trend in the Gini for disposable income from 1984 to 2004 , one would have to argue that it happened in one year – 1993 .
That ’s where the Census Bureau critics begin to stumble .
Burtless writes :
The Census Bureau questionnaire does not provide accurate or consistent assessments of the incomes of the top 2 % or 2½ % of income recipients .
One reason is that respondents ’ answers are top - coded , or at least they were in the not - too - distant past .
Another is that the sample of high - income recipients is too small to give an accurate or consistent estimate of the incomes of the very top income recipients , say , those with incomes above $ 750,000 a year .
This means the Census Bureau probably gives us an underestimate of true income inequality every single year , no matter which concept of income we choose to measure .
Burtless claims the CBO misses a lot of income among those with more than $ 750,000 a year , which he seems to equate with the top 2 % or 2 1/2 % .
But $ 750,000 is only slightly shy of the $ 1.1 million threshold defining the top one - tenth of one percent in Piketty and Saez .
It is miles above the $ 266,800 threshold defining the top 1 % in CBO ’s definition of income which includes , absurdly 59.4 % of corporate profits .
Sampling errors are random , so even if one believes 1080 is too small a sample for the top 2 % , that cannot tell us whether such incomes will be overestimated or underestimated .
It certainly does not imply “ an underestimate of true income inequality every single year . ”
At worst , the estimate of top 2 % incomes would be too large some of the time and too small at other times , which is presumably what Mr. Burtless means by “ consistent . ”
The core of the CBO and Piketty - Saez estimates relies on a sample of adjusted gross income from the Statistics of Income ( SOI ) division of the IRS .
That sample is twice as large as the sample of 54,000 in the Current Population Survey ( CPS ) Annual Social and Economic Supplement .
But the Census Bureau surveys everyone , while the SOI survey just covers those who file a tax return .
The SOI sample oversamples incomes above $ 5 million , but excludes a few trillion dollars of lesser incomes mainly because of tax avoidance ( the $ 1 trillion AGI gap ) and legal nonfilers .
The net result it to exaggerate the ratio of highest incomes to total income .
There is no top - coding of total income , contrary to what Piketty and Saez and Paul Krugman have implied , but there is top - coding of specific types of income in the public use data to protect respondents ’ privacy .
When the Census Bureau calculates the income share of the top 5 % , they use internal data that is free of top - coding , but there remain what Census officials call “ internal processing limits ” on , for example , the maximum salary recorded for any one job .
Edward J. Welniak , Chief of the Income Statistics Branch of Census Bureau , explains :
In 1979 , the questionnaire allowed the recording of up to $ 99,999 for 23 income sources .
In 1985 , the limit for recording earnings from longest job increased to $ 299,999 .
The final recording limit increase occurred in 1993 when each of the four earned income sources allowed the recording of amounts to $ 9,999,999 .
[3 ]
The post -1993 limits obviously pose no problem for total incomes above $ 750,000 , much less for average incomes of the top 1 % or top 5 % .
Welniak found that in 1999 there were no more than 26 cases excluded out of a sample of 54,000 .
He also found , as have Burkhauser and others , that the increases in internal processing limits have caused the increase in inequality over time to be overstated , not understated .
Welniak notes that public use data caused “ overstatement of income inequality growth over the 1967 - 2001 period , ” because the tighter restrictions in the past make it look as though inequality was lower than it really was , while the easing of top - coding limits in the 1990s looks like increased inequality ( rather than just increased visibility of high - income data ) .
In Welniak ’s words , “ The larger growth in income inequality using public - use data is the result of : 1 ) topcoded income in 1967 which reduced measured income inequality and 2 ) increased high income through the plugging of mean topcoded values beginning in 1996 . ”
The pregnant remark from Burtless about respondents ’ answers being top - coded “ in the not - too - distant past ” is a major reason why I argue that Census Bureau Gini coefficients , or top income shares , do not show that inequality has increased since the late 1980s .
Welniak calculates that the 1985 change in methodology caused “ a slight increase ” in measured inequality , when none really occurred .
Since the Gini coefficients from 1979 to 1984 were understated , that means the apparent increase in Gini coefficients in the late eighties was overstated .
In 1993 , Welniak notes that “ CPS ASEC introduced computer - assisted personal interviewing and increased the recording levels for earnings to $ 1 million as well as increasing the recoding levels for other income sources . ”
When Burtless refers to 0.469 as “ the highest Gini coefficient ever recorded , ” he is technically correct that it is higher than 0.466 in 2001 , but he is not correct to compare it with pre-1993 data .
As the Economic Policy Institute has explained , “ a change in survey methodology in 1993 led to a sharp rise in measured inequality . ” [ 4 ]
The dramatic 1993 increases in the amounts of income recorded , and the substitution of computers for pencils , caused a spurious jump in inequality measures .
Before 1993 , in that not - so - distant past , some limits on the amount of certain types of income caused Gini coefficients to be understated , underestimating actual inequality and therefore creating a spurious increase when comparing years before and after 1993 .
It is baffling why Paul Krugman , Piketty and Saez and Burtless all thought sample size and “ top- coding ” was some sort of refutation of my observation that income inequality has not increased since the late eighties .
Sample size could go either way , and changes in top - coding points in the exact opposite direction of what they are trying to imply .
Conclusion
For reasons that were partly explained in my book and further explained in a forthcoming academic paper , not one of the four data sets that attempt to estimate income from a sample of tax returns are credible for comparing income share across periods of changing tax rates .
CBO data is arguably the worst of the four , and Piketty and Saez is the best .
Even W2 data ca n’t be compared across different tax regimes because ( 1 ) the timing of nonqualified stock options exercises is highly sensitive to stock prices and because ( 2 ) switching to restricted stock — which does not appear on the W2 — is highly sensitive to the tax rates on dividends and capital gains .
Ask Bill Gates or Steve Jobs .
If there were any better data showing a significant and sustained increase in the inequality of disposable income , consumption , wages , or wealth since 1988 , I suspect someone would have shared it with us by now .

Scheme
Scheme is a statically scoped and properly tail - recursive dialect of the Lisp programming language invented by Guy Lewis Steele Jr. and Gerald Jay Sussman .
It was designed to have an exceptionally clear and simple semantics and few different ways to form expressions .
A wide variety of programming paradigms , including imperative , functional , and message passing styles , find convenient expression in Scheme .
Scheme was one of the first programming languages to incorporate first class procedures as in the lambda calculus , thereby proving the usefulness of static scope rules and block structure in a dynamically typed language .
Scheme was the first major dialect of Lisp to distinguish procedures from lambda expressions and symbols , to use a single lexical environment for all variables , and to evaluate the operator position of a procedure call in the same way as an operand position .
By relying entirely on procedure calls to express iteration , Scheme emphasized the fact that tail - recursive procedure calls are essentially goto's that pass arguments .
Scheme was the first widely used programming language to embrace first class escape procedures , from which all previously known sequential control structures can be synthesized .
More recently , building upon the design of generic arithmetic in Common Lisp , Scheme introduced the concept of exact and inexact numbers .
Scheme is also the first programming language to support hygienic macros , which permit the syntax of a block - structured language to be extended reliably .

US military prepares Fallujah - style bloodbath in Iraqi city of Baqubah
By Peter Symonds
25 June 2007
A huge US offensive codenamed “ Operation Arrowhead Ripper ” is underway in the Iraqi city of Baqubah , as part of extensive American operations aimed at suppressing insurgent groups in Baghdad and areas to the north and south of the capital .
US troops , backed by armoured vehicles , artillery , helicopter gunships and warplanes , have sealed off the city of 300,000 .
The action recalls the murderous November 2004 assault on Fallujah in which much of the population fled and large sections of the town were levelled .
The number of US deaths has risen sharply as troops have been ordered into more aggressive actions throughout Iraq .
A further 10 soldiers were killed on Saturday — seven in three separate roadside bombings in Baghdad and Tikrit .
Another soldier was killed by small arms fire and two more died of noncombatant causes .
A total of 32 have died in the past six days and 80 so far this month .
Top US generals are warning of continuing high casualty rates .
No reports have been released of Iraqi civilian casualties , which are certain to be far higher .
In a bid to prevent anti-occupation militia leaders fleeing Baqubah , the US military cordoned off the city , trapping the entire population .
At least 8,000 American troops backed by 2,000 Iraqi soldiers and police are systematically sweeping through Baqubah , arbitrarily detaining suspects , destroying pockets of resistance and levelling any building regarded as a potential threat .
Media reports , largely from journalists embedded with US troops , have attempted to portray the operation as a humanitarian mission to liberate the population from “ Al Qaeda ” .
While the designation of all anti-occupation fighters as Al Qaeda extremists suits the Bush administration ’s propaganda purposes at home , it bears no relation to reality .
Sunni extremists last year proclaimed Baqubah the capital of the “ Islamic State of Iraq ” but the group known as “ Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia ” is just one of a number of Sunni insurgent outfits involved .
Reflecting the sentiments in the US military hierarchy , embedded reporter Michael Yon could barely contain his glee over the Baqubah operation .
“ People are trying to escape the fighting , but we made this mistake in places like Tal Afar and Fallujah where our people attacked and left huge escape routes .
This time , the number one priority is to trap and destroy Al Qaeda , ” he wrote on his blog on Friday , adding : “ At the going rate , Al Qaeda in Baqubah will soon have two choices : Surrender , or die . ”
US forces are turning Baqubah , the capital of Diyala province to the north - east of Baghdad , into a giant prison camp .
As the operation got underway last week , leaflets were dropped on the city ordering all residents to remain inside their homes .
The New York Times reported that the military intended to “ fingerprint and take biometric data from every resident who seems to be a potential fighter ” .
Under conditions where survey after survey has revealed that the majority of the Iraqi population is hostile to the US occupation and supportive of armed insurgents , that means everyone is suspect .
According to Stars and Stripes on June 22 , US troops were ordered last Tuesday to detain all Iraqi men they encountered .
A US company from the First Battalion , 23rd Infantry Regiment detained four teenage boys , cuffing their hands with plastic flex and took them away for interrogation .
The father of the two of the boys pleaded with the troops to tell him what would happen with them .
He begged the soldiers not to hand his sons over to Iraqi soldiers or police , fearing that Shiite militiamen who dominate the security forces might kill them .
Embedded journalists dutifully repeated official propaganda that the operation was about winning “ hearts and minds ” and “ bonding ” the Iraqi forces with the local population .
But it was difficult to disguise the widely felt distrust , fear , resentment and hostility to Iraqi and American troops alike .
The New York Times on Friday reported a conversation between a US captain and a resident which “ soon turned into a debate on the Americans ’ conduct in Iraq ” .
While he had no sympathy for Al Qaeda , the 50 - year - old Iraqi angrily criticised US troops for gunning down a man for no reason , a claim the captain denied .
He also made clear that he regarded the Iraqi forces as even worse — little more than Shiite militia in uniform .
American troops went into Baqubah in mid-March but only managed to “ pacify ” two eastern neighbourhoods .
The latest offensive , which began last Tuesday , is focussed on west Baqubah .
“ In Khatoon , the southernmost section of the operations area , the US military conducted earth - shaking bombing runs and house - to - house searches for two days , punctuated by occasional gunfights , ” the Los Angeles Times explained .
Operational commander Brigadier - General Mick Bednarek told the media on weekend : “ It is house to house , block to block , street to street , sewer to sewer — and it ’s also cars , vans — we ’re searching every one of them . ”
He claimed that US forces controlled about 60 percent of the city and had killed 60 to 100 fighters .
Bednarek said troops had trapped about 50 to 100 insurgents and were “ closing the noose ” but predicted it could be weeks before Iraqi military and police secured the area .
Colonel Steve Townsend , commander of the 3rd Stryker Brigade , identified three districts of the city as a problem and said the military proposed to erect concrete barriers and checkpoints around those areas .
Speaking to Reuters , Command Sergeant Major Jeff Huggins bluntly declared : “ We are enveloping the enemy in a kill sack . ”
As in Fallujah , the US military intends to use its vastly superior firepower to level any source of armed resistance .
Early on Friday , US helicopter gunships slaughtered 17 “ Al Qaeda suspects ” on the outskirts of the nearby town of Khalis .
A recent report from Fallujah provided a glimpse of what a “ pacified ” Baqubah will be like .
Much of the city remains in ruins .
Little compensation or assistance has been provided to the residents , who are again under martial law , including a curfew from 6 p.m. to 8 a.m. Muhammed Aydan , a 42 - year - old father , told the IRIN news agency : “ We are living like prisoners , lacking assistance at all levels .
Aid support , which last year was always here , ca n’t be seen anymore .
We depend solely on ourselves , drinking dirty water even though we know our children are getting sick from it .
Power supply is less than two hours a day in some areas of Fallujah and sometimes we have to go three days without a shower to save water . ”
In Baqubah , residents are already complaining of receiving no water or electricity since the start of Operation Arrowhead Ripper .
Insisting that Baqubah is a Sunni insurgent stronghold , the Shiite - dominated government in Baghdad has provided little in the way of assistance and services to the city on the pretext that it would fall into the hands of Al Qaeda .
It is already clear that the offensive in Baqubah is not going to be the final showdown with anti-occupation insurgents that the American military had hoped it would be .
Lieutenant General Raymond Odierno told the press last Friday that US intelligence estimated that 80 percent of the top Al Qaeda leaders had fled the city before fighting had even begun .
Amid recriminations as to who was responsible , Odierno declared : “ Frankly , I think they knew an operation was coming in Baqubah .
They watched the news .
They understood we had a surge .
They understood Baqubah was designated as a problem area . ”
Baqubah is just the most prominent of a series of targets aimed at so - called Al Qaeda strongholds that have been used as staging areas for attacks in Baghdad .
In what it terms “ the Battle of the Baghdad belts , ” the US military is conducting operations in other areas of Diyala to the north of the capital , the Arab Jabour area in the south , various safe havens to the west and northwest and in the Baghdad districts of Adhamiya , Rashid and Mansour .
Odierno claimed on Friday that the new operations had been successful in seizing more than 700 detainees , killing 160 insurgents and uncovering hundreds of weapons caches and bombs .
What Odierno is describing is not the suppression of isolated groups of insurgents , but a colonial - style war of repression against a hostile population .
As they rampage through cities like Baqubah , the US troops are creating fresh reserves of hostility and opposition to the illegitimate American occupation of the country .
President Bush has a ( changing ) standard for success in Iraq .
But does he have a standard for failure ?
It 's the kind of question I 've faced with my clients in my work as an executive coach , helping leaders become more effective .
I met recently with a CEO client I 've had for years .
He has several pet projects that , in my opinion , should be shut down .
His view is that , come hell or high water , they will continue until they succeed .
We both have our perspectives , and many others have weighed in as well .
At our recent meeting , I asked him to describe what success would look like .
He did .
But then I asked a tougher question :
What is your standard that , if met , would leave no doubt of failure ?
Something that would say it 's time to walk away from Business X or Project Y ?
We discovered that he had n't defined one .
So as Business X limped along for nine months without scoring a win , and Project Y looked headed for defeat as well , there would continue to be plenty of opinions – but no definitive action .
That 's why we agreed on the need for a failure measurement that transcends opinions .
Great leaders set and stick with clear standards for failure as well as success .
Others act like gambling addicts , greedily seeing only success , depleting their cash without any off switch .
Similar to my client 's situation , there has never been agreement on the status of the war in Iraq because there are no agreed - upon measurements .
Until such a yardstick exists , we can't agree about whether the US is winning or losing .
If we can't agree on present conditions , then it 's critical that we have tripwires at both ends of the effectiveness spectrum : one for success , and one for failure .
The former is difficult to determine because it 's shifted considerably .
In 2005 , the White House defined victory in Iraq in three stages that culminate in a peaceful , united , stable , and secure partner in the war on terror .
But just this month , President Bush appeared to lower the bar , saying : " Either we 'll succeed , or we wo n't succeed .
And the definition of success as I described is sectarian violence down .... "
Meanwhile , the tripwire for failure does n't seem to exist .
Obviously , the United States must not share its failure guidelines with the enemy .
But if such standards were crystal clear among America 's leaders , we would see much greater consensus in Washington , if not an end to the US occupation of Iraq .
Gen. David Petraeus and Mr. Bush ask that we wait until we assess the " surge . "
They , like my CEO client , wo n't know when to give up unless they develop a failure standard .
Being stubborn helps leaders rise to the top .
They like to get their way , to be right , and to win .
Taken too far , that lovable bull - headedness becomes naked obsession , ego , or self - will – signs of addiction .
Recovering addicts , like great leaders , know when to admit defeat .
It 's not too late for our leaders to set and stick with an objective , measurable standard for losing .

The corgi was minced and cooked with apple , onion and seasoning
It was reported on 30 May that Ono watched performance artist Mark McGowan consume a dead dog on London radio station Renaissance FM and tasted what he was eating .
But she was not , as reported in an earlier version of the story , in the studio at the time , having flown to Russia for the opening of her Moscow Biennale show .
McGowan , a vegetarian , said he staged the stunt to protest over the Royal Family 's alleged treatment of animals .
A fox was reportedly mistreated during a hunt led by Prince Philip in January , though the RSPCA said it did not suffer .
' Exhilarating '
McGowan described the corgi - which he said had died at a breeding farm - as " really disgusting " .
" It 's stinky , it 's white - looking , it 's not like any meat I 've ever seen , " he continued .
Viewed " as an art piece " , though , he considered his unusual meal " exhilarating " .
However , presenter Bob Smith said he was not convinced the meat - reportedly cooked with apple , onion and seasoning - actually came from a dog .
McGowan 's previous stunts include leaving a tap running in a gallery to highlight water wastage and using his nose to push a peanut to Downing Street to protest against student debt .
A spokeswoman for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ( Peta ) said she approved of his latest shock tactic .
If old dogs have n’t been able to learn new tricks , maybe that ’s because no one has known how to teach them properly .
Until quite recently orthodox neuroscience held that only the brains of young children are resilient , malleable , and morphable — in a word , plastic .
This neuroplasticity , as it is called , seems to fade steadily as the brain congeals into its fixed adult configuration .
Infants can sustain massive brain damage , up to the loss of an entire cerebral hemisphere , and still develop into nearly normal adults ; any adult who loses half the brain , by contrast , is a goner .
Adults can’t learn to speak new languages without an accent , ca n’t take up piano in their fifties then go on to play Carnegie Hall , and often suffer strokes that lead to permanent paralysis or cognitive deficiencies .
The mature brain , scientists concluded , can only decline .
It turns out this theory is not just wrong , it is spectacularly wrong .
Two new books , Train Your Mind , Change Your Brain ( Ballantine Books , $ 24.95 ) by science journalist Sharon Begley and The Brain That Changes Itself ( Viking , $ 24.95 ) by psychiatrist Norman Doidge , offer masterfully guided tours through the burgeoning field of neuroplasticity research .
Each has its own style and emphasis ; both are excellent .
Both authors present more or less the same historical background , recounting landmark experiments by a small constellation of neuroscientists who doggedly championed the idea of adult neuroplasticity through its wilderness years , from the 1960s throughmid-1990s .
Both also describe how mainstream neuroscience , to its chagrin as well as its delight , is finally warming to the idea that much of the neural dynamism in the childhood brain remains active all through life ( it just needs a little help to manifest fully ) .
Finally , both authors conclude that adult neuroplasticity is a vastly undertapped resource , one with which Western medicine and psychology are just now coming to grips .
An important emerging research agenda is to figure out ways to direct and maximize this brain repair and reorganization .
Those permanently paralyzed stroke patients ?
Quite a few are now recovering far more function than conventional physical therapy allows , thanks to new rehabilitation programs that capitalize on neuroplasticity .
Other breakthroughs include treatments for learning disorders like dyslexia , mental training programs that can halt and even reverse senility , and promising treatments for post - traumatic stress , ­obsessive - compulsive disorder , depression , and other notorious ills of the human mind .
Some of the new techniques are so low - tech that they could have been employed by physicians of antiquity , if only they had known about them .
In fact , great breakthroughs in applied neuroplasticity were apparently made long ago by practitioners of Tibetan Buddhism .
The scientific investigation of Buddhist meditation , one of the most fascinating areas of neuroplasticity research today , is the focus and polestar of Begley ’s book .
In elegant and lucid prose , she recounts the story of a remarkable collaboration forged just a few years ago between Western neuroscientists and senior Tibetan Buddhist monks .
Their spiritual leader , the Dalai Lama , who brokered much of the discourse , comes across as remarkably astute and friendly to science .
This unusual syncretic exercise between the academy and a major world religion may rouse suspicion among hard - nosed skeptics , but an open mind here will be rewarded .
The research does not concern metaphysical claims regarding reincarnation and karma ; rather , it involves measurable , replicable effects of Buddhist meditation practices on the mind and brain .
This rigorous mental training drives neuroplasticity in ways that awe many of the scientists studying it .
Brain scans reveal that the neural activity of highly trained monks is off the charts , relative to meditation novices , in circuits that involve maternal love ( caudate ) , empathy ( right insula ) , and feelings of joy and happiness ( left prefrontal cortex ) .
Even when these monks are not meditating , their brains bear the imprints of their psychic workouts .
The latter two structures , for instance , are anatomically enlarged .
Based on results like these , Begley holds out hope that our emotional lives and personalities , far from being carved in stone by our genes and early experiences , will prove as sculptable through mental training as our bodies are through physical training .
Doidge ’s book covers more territory at the expense of tighter focus .
This is not a bad thing , since the end result is a solid survey of one of neuroscience ’s hottest areas .
A practicing psychiatrist , Doidge chronicles not only the science and theory of neuroplasticity , but also his conversations with diverse patients — dealing with all manner of emotional and neurological afflictions — who are directly benefiting from the science .
He speaks with researchers , too , about their moments of inspiration and insight .
Along with eminently clear accounts of the relevant concepts and experiments , he gives well - turned descriptions of personalities and in - the - moment reactions .
This wider sampling and more intimate depiction makes for an appealing read .
If either book can be faulted , it would be for the occasional whiff of overstatement .
At times each author seems to say that our brains ’ potential for transformation is essentially infinite , rather than merely astonishing and paradigm busting .
But these excesses of enthusiasm are understandable , given the present - day backdrop .
Science , like any other human endeavor , is susceptible to trends and pendulous swings of groupthink .
The current vogue is for “ neurogenetic determinism , ” the view that your genes and subconscious are the true , essential shapers of who you are and how you think and behave ; the conscious mind is little more than a self - important figurehead along for the ride .
Begley and Doidge wade against this current with a strong message of hope :
By recognizing neuroplasticity as a real and powerful force , we can tilt our theories of mind back into a realm where choice and free will are meaningful concepts , and where radical improvement to the human condition is possible using the right , scientifically proven techniques .
The wonderful thing is , the hope they offer is not of the blind variety .
There are solid , empirical reasons to think they may be right .
Perhaps the world does not need another web browser – but it may want Bart Decrem's .
Decrem and a small cadre of programmers in Palo Alto , California , have spent this summer quietly readying Flock , an open - source browser , for an early October beta launch .
Several members of the team , including Decrem , hail from the Mozilla Foundation , which produced the Firefox browser upon which Flock is built .
Flock advertises itself as a " social browser , " meaning that the application plays nicely with popular web services like Flickr , Technorati and del.icio.us .
Flock also features widely compliant WYSIWYG , drag - and - drop blogging tools .
The browser even promises to detect and authenticate all those user accounts automatically .
It 's a clear attempt to be the browser of choice for the Web 2.0 user .
It 's no coincidence that the buzz has built rapidly to a rolling boil .
Blogger and tech pundit Robert Scoble simply calls it " awesome . "
Given the recent swell of anticipation surrounding Flock , the preceding stealth period seems quaint by contrast .
Since an August demo at Bar Camp , enthusiastic blog posts have amounted to love letters in their enthusiasm .
But why ?
" The browser has not evolved all that much , " Decrem says .
" The basic concept or vision has not changed . "
He says the web was until recently conceptually conceived as a big library , a collection of documents to search and consume .
Browsers were all about navigation .
Now , he notes , " Web 2.0 is a stream of events , people and connections . "
A better browser is one that will understand this new user environment .
Recently , Firefox has become , for many , the multi-platform browser of choice .
Popular extensions like Greasemonkey have given users unprecedented control over their browsing experience .
But combining separately developed , often - updated extensions can make Firefox unstable .
Boris Mann , a Flock tester and admirer , claims that it " takes the best - of approach .
It takes Greasemonkey and other power - browsing tools and it makes them work .
And their genius is sticking with Firefox at the rendering level . "
Decrem notes that Flock will not attempt to compete with Firefox , which he helped launch last year .
" Open source is an important part of our DNA , " he adds .
Yet , browsers are still " too inert " for Decrem 's tastes .
The Flock team speaks of moving back to the original vision of Tim Berners - Lee , that the web should be a two - way experience .
" There are lots of opportunities to innovate the browser client .
We are receiving a lot of interest as we plant those seeds . "
The clamor suggests that there is considerable interest in a beefier browser .
And while Flock 's initial audience is clearly power users , Kris Krug of Bryght sees it as " a Web 2.0 on - ramp " that will draw more people to social software , blogging and photo sharing .
" We are not trying to do Firefox with five more features .
We are trying to solve a very specific problem – yet it 's a problem commonly experienced by many users , " says Decrem .
Rumor has it that Flock will soon announce key partnerships around its search , bookmarking and blogging tools .
While the Flocksters experimented with their own hosted bookmark service , " we concluded we 're not an online services company , " says Decrem .
Scoble thinks
Flock is just the beginning of integrated web applications .
In a weighty compliment , he draws a comparison to Microsoft Office , which in the 1990s succeeded in migrating users of separate spreadsheet , word - processing , database and presentation programs to a single , bundled product .
" Today we 're using too many different services to share our stuff on the internet , " says Scoble .
" Blogging , photo sharing , wikis , maps , podcasting ( and ) video blogging are all separate services .
They probably will be joined in one system with common user interfaces . "
Flock may or may not become the Office of the web .
But , for now , it 's one of a kind , at least as far as buzz goes .
U.S. may negotiate with Iraqi insurgents
An Iraqi boy inspects a damaged car after a massive car bomb tore through a market in the Baghdad district of Amil , Tuesday .
The team , led by Gen. David Petraeus and U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker , is laying out a new course for how to proceed in the four - year - old war , the officials told CNN .
One element of the plan is to try to identify groups of people -- including possibly Sunni extremists and militia groups -- with whom U.S. officials feel they can do business , such as negotiating power - sharing and cease - fire agreements and granting economic aid , the sources said .
But those with whom officials feel they cannot do business -- such as determined suicide bombers -- will remain targets of military forces , the sources said .
The officials cited an inability to maintain current troop levels into the summer as a reason for the changed course .
" We have been focused too long on defeating the enemy , " one official said .
" We need to bring them to the negotiating table . "
The announcement is an acknowledgment that the traditional war - fighting stance of trying to capture or kill all insurgents is failing , that the country may have devolved into a civil war , and that the only way to proceed is to use military force sparingly and attempt to bring many insurgents into the fold .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- U.S. officials said Wednesday that a " joint campaign plan redesign team " is preparing a new diplomatic and military strategy for Iraq , which is expected to be approved by the end of the month .

The UK is awaiting the release of a report by the Gowers Review of Intellectual Property , a task force charged with suggesting changes to the country 's intellectual property laws .
The formation of the commission has inspired a flurry of private books and reports on IP designed to influence debate on the subject .
While many of these are exactly as interesting as you 'd expect , a new report from the Institute for Public Policy Research offers a fascinating look at the reasons behind intellectual property rights and suggests a new way forward for Britain : thinking about knowledge as a public resource first , and a private asset second .
Is this idealistic , anti-business pinko blue - skying ?
The group says no .
The two functions of knowledge
The report , which was funded by the BBC , the British Library , and the UK Film Council , is an attempt to get beyond the rhetoric of IP maximalists who always want more protection and longer copyright terms and free culture radicals who want to " share information with impunity . "
Recognizing the legitimate private rights that must be granted to business in order to encourage investment and creative production , the authors of the report also make a strong case for " creating as strong a political voice for public domain as currently exists for other interests . "
Only when consumers ( and the businesses that rely on public domain work ) have a real seat at the table can the concerns of each group be properly balanced .
The report opens with an observation : knowledge can play two very different roles in society .
It can be a commodity that is bought , sold , and protected by copyright , but it can also serve as " social glue " that gives a society a sense of cohesion .
" It is through the sharing of information that we are able to develop our intellectual and creative talents , discover new artists , create new businesses , forge alliances between academic and commercial institutions , and learn from one another , " says the report , and argues that both uses — not just the business case for copyrights — need to be considered by the government .
Four models
The study details four models which balance these competing interests in different ways .
First , there 's the American model , where knowledge is understood solely as an asset .
Some fair use , parody , and public domain rights are recognized , but consumer rights are restricted , copyright terms are extended , and DRM trumps fair use .
This is because knowledge is viewed as a form of property , not a social good .
As the study notes , there is a danger in this approach : " Where IPRs [ intellectual property rights ] are understood as comparable to conventional property rights , public domain could potentially disappear altogether , just as the enclosure movement eradicated common land all over the UK in the late 18th century . "
The second model currently describes the UK , where knowledge is an asset first and a public resource second .
This means that producers are generally protected first , and while more consumer rights may be upheld , the relationship between DRM and fair use is not resolved , and copyright terms may be continuously extended .
The third model is that of a society where knowledge is first seen as a public resource and only secondarily as an asset .
Comparing this to the " open access " movement in academic publishing , the authors note that such an approach is not anti-business .
Under this model , public interest is the basis for IP policy , copyright terms are not extended , and fair use trumps DRM .
Finally , the fourth model is " cyber- socialism , " where knowledge is seen only as a public resource and copyright is not allowed .
The profits of creativity are returned to the public and a " new ethic of playfulness and voluntarism " is the norm .
The authors see these ideals at work in open source projects like Linux and Wikipedia , but point out that " it is not clear how such a model could be used to fit in investment - heavy models of innovation and creativity , such as the development of drugs or films . "
Recommendations
When it comes to issuing recommendations , the report is clear : the UK should move gradually from the second model to the third .
The obvious objection that arises is that such a model is " anti- business " and does not reward producers for their investments of time and money .
The authors of the report shrewdly point out , though , that " the goal of a policy framework that suits business in general is illusory . "
Business is not a monolith ; while certain approaches to intellectual property might be better for certain types of businesses , companies can thrive even under the fourth model ( think of open source firms like Red Hat ) .
Furthermore , the authors believe that making knowledge a social good first will actually foster increased innovation and therefore more money for UK businesses .
In defense of their position that the public interest has no strong advocate at the bargaining table , the report points out that the Patent Office 's official mission is to " stimulate innovation and enhance the international competitiveness of British industry and commerce , " not to ensure that British citizens have appropriate access to knowledge .
Were the government to transition to the third model , that would have to change .
The government itself is less keen on any sort of radical change to the current system , but has shown a willingness to consider ideas found in the report .
But the government will give much more consideration to whatever recommendations are made by the Gowers Review .
Ripping a CD legally
While some of the larger structural changes desired by the IPPR might not end up as Gowers Review recommendations , one of their specific proposals stands a good chance of becoming law in the near future .
Britain has a bizarre copyright law that prevents consumers from legally ripping music from CD to their portable music players , which criminalizes the activities of half the people in the country , according the the Guardian .
Ian Kearns , the deputy director of the IPPR , told the paper , " When it comes to protecting the interests of copyright holders , the emphasis the music industry has put on tackling illegal distribution and not prosecuting for personal copying is right .
But it is not the music industry 's job to decide what rights consumers have .
That is the job of government . "
The IPPR report calls for the removal of the restriction on CD ripping .
With most people doing it anyway , you can bet such an item would be a popular feature of the Gowers Review .
We 'll know within weeks whether it made the cut .

Tool use in wild chimpanzees ( Image : David Bygott )
By training captive chimps to use tools in different ways , they have shown experimentally that primates develop cultural traditions through imitation .
This has long been suspected from observations in the wild , but has not been shown directly .
It suggests that culture has ancient origins , scientists write in Nature .
The study was carried out by a team at the University of St Andrews in the UK and the National Primate Research Center of Emory University in Atlanta , US .
They presented two different groups of chimps with a problem relevant to their wild cousins : how to retrieve an item of food stuck behind a blockage in a system of tubes .
One chimpanzee from each group was secretly taught a novel way to solve the problem .
Ericka was taught how to use a stick to lift the blockage up so that the food fell out .
A chimpanzee watches her mother retrieve food ( Drawing by Amy Whiten )
Another female chimp , Georgia , was shown how to poke at the blockage so that the ball of food rolled out of the back of the pipes .
Each chimp was then reunited with its group , and the scientists watched how they behaved .
They found that the chimps gathered around Ericka or Georgia and soon copied their behaviour .
By the end of two months , the two different groups were still using their own way of getting at the food and two distinct cultural traditions had been established .
" This is the first time that any scientist has experimentally created two different traditions in any primate , " Professor Andrew Whiten of the University of St Andrews told the BBC News website .
" Moreover , it is the first time anyone has ever done this with tool use in any animal . "
Ancient origins
The research adds weight to decades of field studies on wild primates suggesting that they have rich cultural traditions unmatched in species other than our own .
Chimpanzees in West Africa , for example , use stones and pieces of wood to crack open nuts for food ; but this has never been observed in chimps living in East Africa .
It suggests that the common ancestor of chimps and humans , living some four to six million years ago , probably also had a desire to conform - the hallmark of human culture .
" If both species have elements of culture , it is highly likely the ancient ancestor had too , " said co-author Dr Victoria Horner , " so culture probably has a deep - rooted ancient origin . "

Most web pages are made up of HTML files linked to separate image files .
Here 's a way to embed an image directly into an HTML file .
Enter the URL of any JPEG , PNG or GIF on the web :
How does it work ?
A table is created which is filled with large numbers of 1x1 cells .
Each cell has a background colour of the corresponding pixel in the image .
That 's all it is ; just a massive grid of coloured table cells .
View the source to see the details or browse the Python script or the Perl script which generates the table .
Why does it take so long to load ?
Tables are an inefficient way of encoding detailed graphics .
A normal image file takes about two bytes to encode each pixel .
By contrast the HTML version takes nearly fifty bytes to do the same .
This means the size of the file is very large .
To combat this , the HTML table uses basic RLE compression .
Runs of multiple cells on the same row with the same colour are merged into one cell using the COLSPAN attribute .
One could achieve higher compression ratios by also merging cells that had very similar colours ; thus making the format ' lossy ' .
Why does it take so long to display ?
Web browsers are designed to display image files ; they are n't optimised for 10,000 cell tables .
To help the browser out , the table is chopped up into smaller tables , each containing about 15 horizontal lines .
This allows browsers like MSIE to render the chunks independently without having to wait for the entire image to load .
Other browsers such as Mozilla do n't care , since they are capable of rendering tables as they load .
So it 's big , bloated and slow .
What use is this ?
In its pure form , none .
At least none that I can think of .
However , it is the seed for a powerful tool .
Combining table - based images with JavaScript opens the door to the creation and manipulation of dynamic content .
Take a look at this simple example of a column of navigation buttons .
Each of the arrows is a clever mix of graphics ( for the tip ) , text ( for the label ) and simple table - based imagery ( for the borders , and background ) .
JavaScript is used to bring the whole thing together and to animate it on mouse roll - overs .
Using pure graphics would have involved loading ten different images ( instead of two ) and would have made it more difficult to create or edit the text on the buttons .
The lesson here is to think outside the box .
Images and HTML are more interchangeable than they look .
With a little imagination one can make small , dynamic and visually appealing content without resorting to Flash or Shockwave .
What 's next ?
URI - encoded images have made table - encoded images obsolete ( except for Internet Explorer ) .
I 've written a library which creates images with JavaScript .

Democratic senator : Impeachment ' sucks all of the oxygen out of the air ' Miriam Raftery
Published : Wednesday May 2 , 2007 Print This Email This Gravel : Impeachment ' will come , in due course '
At last weeks debate , Democratic Presidential candidates were asked to raise their hands if they would support impeachment .
Other than Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( who has introduced impeachment papers against Cheney ) , not a single candidate raised their hand .
So RAW STORY decided to find out why .
At the California Democratic Convention in San Diego over the weekend , RAW STORY obtained responses directly from Senator Christopher Dodd ( D - CONN ) , and 2008 candidates New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson and former Alaskan Senator Mike Gravel , then elicited help from a blogger present to pose the question to Senators Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) and former North Carolina Senator John Edwards .
Senator Barack Obama ( D - IL ) did not host a press conference and was not available to the media .
The question was posed slightly differently for various candidates , depending on availability .
The most detailed response came from Gravel during a press conference .
RAW STORY listed several potential grounds for impeachment , including starting a war on apparently false premises , issuing signing statements that ignore the will of Congress , abolishing habeus corpus , and declaring the " right " to spy on Americans  e-mails even as the White House itself " loses " thousands of e-mails now requested by Congress .
 Dont worry about impeachment ,  Gravel said in a reassuring tone , adding that he has held discussions with House Judiciary Chair John Conyers ( D - MI ) .
 That will come , in due course . 
Gravel plan could land Bush " behind bars " Gravel criticized the President as a lousy and immoral commander in chief , but also levied criticism at Democrats for only passing a non-binding resolution to end the war .
Nor does the former senator believe simply cutting off funds would work .
 I filibustered to end funding in the Vietnam War , but it was not successful ,  he recalled .
Instead , Gravel revealed a novel plan to bring about an end to the Iraq War , impeachment , or possibly both and perhaps even land the President " behind bars . "
 I have drafted a law that says we must get troops out of Iraq in 60 days ,  he said .
 Leave all the equipment behind The President must certify that he took troops out .
If he violates this law he should go to jail for five years with no parole , and pay a $ 1 million fine .
It says so right in the law . 
He believes he could muster enough support in the House to pass the bill .
If the Senate filibusters , he would urge Reid to call for a cloture vote daily .
 The media will feed on this like maggots ,  said Gravel , who predicts the measure would pass and that a veto could ultimately be overridden .
If the President and Vice President then refuse to enact the law , he concluded , once you have them breaking the law , now you impeach . 
Dodd : " I 've been down that road " RAW STORY caught up with Dodd at a dinner honoring House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
We asked what kind of example it sets for kids across America if Congress fails to impeach the President and Vice President for lying about the justification for war , violating the Constitution , and issuing signing statements declaring the right to ignore laws passed by Congress .
 Ive been down that road ,  said Dodd , who shook his head and recalled the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton as he hastened away .
 It sucks all of the oxygen out of the air . 
In a hallway after a press conference , we asked Richardson what message it sends to kids regarding accountability if Congress fails to hold the President and Vice President accountable for their actions .
 We should enforce our laws ,  said Richardson , but stopped short of supporting impeachment .
 This is why Im for the deauthorization ,  he added in an apparent reference to deauthorizing the Presidents use of military force in Iraq .
Blogger June Caldwell prodded a delegate at a packed meet - and - greet with supporters to pose the question to John Edwards .
The blogger phrased the question this way :  If Congress cant get votes to override the Presidents veto , is impeachment a viable alternative to ending this war ? 
According to the blogger , Edwards replied ,  No , just keep sending him the bill . 
No candidate understands the ramifications of impeachment more fully than former First Lady Hillary Clinton .
The New York senator 's husband was impeached for " obstruction of justice " and " perjury " after denying to a grand jury that he had " sexual relations " with a White House intern , but the Senate acquitted him in 1999 .
Asked by a bystander to support impeachment of Bush , the former first lady replied ,  I understand the sentiment ,  then jested ,  We will impeach him in November 2008 ,  according to our blogger source .
PASADENA , Calif . —
Sometimes a particular piece of plastic is just what you need .
You have lost the battery cover to your cellphone , perhaps .
Or your daughter needs to have the golden princess doll she saw on television .
Now .
In a few years , it will be possible to make these items yourself .
You will be able to download three - dimensional plans online , then push Print .
Hours later , a solid object will be ready to remove from your printer .
It ’s not quite the transporter of “ Star Trek , ” but it is a step closer .
Three - dimensional printers have been seen in industrial design shops for about a decade .
They are used to test part designs for cars , airplanes and other products before they are sent to manufacturing .
Once well over $ 100,000 each , such machines can now be had for $ 15,000 .
In the next two years , prices are expected to fall further , putting the printers in reach of small offices and even corner copy stores .
The next frontier will be the home .
One company that wants to be the first to deliver a 3 - D printer for consumers is Desktop Factory , started by IdeaLab , a technology incubator here .
The company will start selling its first printer for $ 4,995 this year .
Deadliest Creatures
Researchers following a group of adult polar bears wearing GPS collars found a 45 percent mortality rate among the cubs of those who swam 30 miles or more at a time , as compared with an 18 percent mortality rate among the cubs of other polar bears .

You might not think of these cuddly bears as being deadly , but wait until you read what they can do .
Inside you 'll find some other truly scary creatures , from things so small you 'll barely see them to ones so big you can't miss them ( but you 'll wish you did ) .
Most do n't kill very many humans , but they can be incredibly ferocious predators in the wild , and each demands our respect .
Editor 's Note :
This list , originally published in 2005 , was updated in March 2016 to reflect the latest information .
The list of bugs , beasts and lethal animals of several kinds , however , has n't changed one iota .
Asian Cobra
Indian cobra ( Image credit : Kamalnv , Wikipedia )
While the Asian cobra does n't hold the title of most venomous snake , it does the most with what it has .
And it 's one creature that kills its fair share of people .
Of the 50,000 human deaths by snakebite a year , Asian cobras are responsible for the largest chunk .
Oh , and if you ever come face to face with one , keep in mind they can shoot venom up to 6 feet ( 2 meters ) with tremendous accuracy .
The cocktail of neurotoxins and poisons can blind you .
The next one will really bug you .
Mosquito

Most mosquito bites just make you itch .
But some mosquitoes carry and transfer malaria causing parasites .
As a result , these little pests are responsible for the deaths of more than two million people a year .
Most recently , mosquitoes were identified as carriers of the scary zika virus , too .
Now for some perspective , as this next great killer rarely actually kills a human . . .
Great White Shark

You knew this one would be on the list , right ?
Blood in the water can excite these sharks into a feeding frenzy , where they 'll use all 3,000 of their teeth to bite anything that moves .
We must say , though , that for all their ferociousness , human deaths from shark attacks are rare .
In 2014 , there were 72 unprovoked shark attacks on humans worldwide , and three deaths .

You do not want to tangle with this gelatinous blob !
Australian Box Jellyfish
Tropical - dwelling box jellyfish have a cube - shaped body , and four different types of special - purpose eyes :
The most primitive set detects only light levels , but another is more sophisticated and can detect the color and size of objects .

Also known as the sea wasp , this salad - bowl sized jellyfish can have up to 60 tentacles each 15 feet long .
Each tentacle has 5,000 stinging cells and enough toxin to kill 60 humans .
There are no official records kept , but researchers figure dozens of people are killed by these jellies every year : far more than are killed by sharks !
One word on this next killer : Roar !
African Lion

Giant fangs ?
Check .
Lightning quick ?
That too .
Razor sharp claws ?
You betcha .
Hungry ?
You better hope not .
These big cats are near perfect hunters .
But here 's something we bet you did n't know :
In the days after a full moon , lions are more likely to attack humans , one study found .
Why ?
Because with bright moonlight , their regular prey sees them coming , and the lions get hungry .
Watch where you step if this next beast is nearby . . .
Crocodile
Among crocodilians , Crocodylus rhombifer ( shown here ) is one of the world ’s most endangered species with the smallest natural distribution .
In Cuba , the species coexists with the American crocodile ( Crocodylus acutus ) .

Do n't mistake this croc for a log !
It can lay still in the water , waiting for passers by .
Then , in the blink of an eye , it 'll lunge at prey , pulling it under water to drown and dismember .
You 're more likely to die of a bee sting than to be killed by a crocodile , but still , what a way to go !
Modern crocs inherited their famed " death roll " from their ancient ancestors , a 2014 study of fossils found .
OK , this next beast is huge .
But deadly ?
Elephant

Not every elephant is as friendly as Dumbo .
Elephants kill more than 500 people a year worldwide .
African elephants generally weigh in around 16,000 pounds .
All the better to stomp you with .
And then there 's those sharp tusks ( graphic video ) .
Next :
Do notkiss this little critter .
Poison Dart Frog

These pint - sized frogs are n't for kissing .
Their backs ooze a slimy neurotoxin that is meant to keep predators away .
Each frog produces enough of the toxin to kill 10 humans .
Next : A surprise entry is next .
Polar Bear
Researchers following a group of adult polar bears wearing GPS collars found a 45 percent mortality rate among the cubs of those who swam 30 miles or more at a time , as compared with an 18 percent mortality rate among the cubs of other polar bears .
( Image credit : World Wildlife Fund )
Sure they might look cuddly at the zoo , but in the wild they eat elephant seals for breakfast .
Get between one and its cub and it could easily rip off your head with one swipe of its giant paw .
Still , there are only two or three attacks on humans by polar bears each year , almost always because humans get into their environment , often while camping , and do n't take proper precautions , according to the conservation group Polar Bears International .
The next and last deadly beast on our list gets vicious in a whole different way .
. .
Cape Buffalo

When faced with a predator , cape buffaloes charge head on .
That 's 1,500 pounds of beast topped off with two big , sharp horns .
You 're lucky if there 's only one - the real danger comes when a herd of thousands stampedes in your direction .
By the way , did you know why American bison are often wrongly called buffalo ?
It 's because when early settlers saw them , they were reminded of the creatures by that name that they 'd seen elsewhere .

Wright ( left ) , Mason ( second right ) and Gilmour ( right ) played together
Roger Waters and David Gilmour , who famously fell out more than 25 years ago , appeared separately at the tribute gig at London 's Barbican Centre .
Gilmour was joined by original drummer Nick Mason and keyboard player Rick Wright , while Waters played solo .
Damon Albarn , Chrissie Hynde and Robyn Hitchcock also performed Barrett songs .
The guitarist was the band 's first creative force and an influential songwriter , writing their early favourites .
Gilmour ( centre ) led the other artists in a grand finale
They then took part in a finale performance of Bike , from the band 's debut album , featuring all the night 's performers - except Waters .
Waters , a former schoolfriend of Barrett with whom he formed the band in 1965 , played his own song Flickering Flame before the interval .
The musician , who is playing at Earls Court on Friday and Saturday , said he found smaller shows " more frightening " because he had a " sense of shame " - which Barrett did not suffer from .
Creative risks
" Before the illness , he kinda lived his life like he walked , " the star told the crowd .
" I think it 's because of his lack of a sense of shame that he was able to take all the creative risks he did . "
The " illness " was a mental deterioration blamed on heavy drug use , which led to Barrett leaving the band in 1968 and living most of the rest of his life as a recluse .
" Without Syd , I do n't know what I 'd be doing - I 'd probably be a property developer or something , " Waters added .
The show included snippets of films from Pink Floyd 's early days
When Gilmour , Mason and Wright appeared at the show 's climax , some fans shouted " where 's Roger ? " and " Pink Floyd " - but those hoping for the classic line - up were disappointed .
The quartet have only buried their differences and performed together once since 1981 - after being on the receiving end of Bob Geldof 's famously forceful powers of persuasion for Live 8 in 2005 .
But the night was intended to be about Barrett rather than Gilmour and Waters .
Nephew 's thanks
Damon Albarn performed a song from the guitarist 's solo album Opel - a list of spoken words that the Blur and Gorillaz frontman described as " early rap " .
Albarn also persuaded Barrett 's nephew Ian to speak on stage .
Referring to his uncle 's real name Roger , he said : " I 'm sure Rog is up there somewhere .
" Just thanks - I 've got so much to thank him for . "
Martha Wainwright , Kate McGarrigle and her niece Lily Lanken gave one of the evening 's most touching performances , playing See Emily Play , which reached number six in the UK 1967 .
Syd 's musical vision was a one - off that defined the mood and sound of psychedelic London
Joe Boyd
Pink Floyd producer
Chrissie Hynde played two songs from Barrett 's The Madcap Laughs album , while The Incredible String Band 's Mike Heron , Captain Sensible and Oasis bassist Andy Bell also appeared .
The performers played in front of psychedelic visuals put together by the people who created Pink Floyd 's legendary light shows on swinging London 's underground scene .
The concert was curated by Pink Floyd collaborator Nick Laird - Clowes and Joe Boyd , who produced the band 's early records .
' Important ' songwriter
Listening to Barrett 's solo albums was a reminder of " what a great songwriter he was and how important he was to British culture " , Boyd said .
" Syd 's musical vision was a one - off that defined the mood and sound of psychedelic London 1966 - 67 , " he told the BBC News website .
" His legacy is more abstract , since the biggest Floyd albums do n't include his songs .
But his influence is felt not only in everything the Floyd ever did , but also via very British artists as diverse as Bowie to Cocker and so many more . "
Barrett died in July at the age of 60 from complications arising from diabetes .
John Hockenberry on Reporting the War at NBC
John Hockenberry is a long - time , well - known American journalist .
He ’s won four Emmy awards and three Peabody awards .
Now that , as he puts it , “ mainstream media does n’t want John Hockenberry anymore , ” he ’s become a Distinguished Fellow at the MIT Media Lab , where he recently gave a talk which commented on some of his experiences covering the Iraq war while at NBC .
Here are some excerpts :
I was very happily employed at NBC .
I was n’t like , running around , trying to stuff toilet paper into the plumbing and sabotage the place . [ … ]
But I was interested , because we had a lot of meetings at NBC about , you know , if you ’re doing a story and the person you ’re doing the story about offers to buy you a drink , you ’ve gotta say no .
If you ’re doing a story and they send you , after they see the story , some napkin rings — silver napkin rings that are monogrammed “ Thank you , Jon , for the story , ” you ’ve got not only to return those , you ’ve got to report those to the standards people at NBC because there ’s a whole ethics and conflict - of - interest thing .
So at one of these ethics meetings — I called them the return - the - napkin - ring kinds of meetings — I raised my hand and said “ You know , is n’t it a problem that the contract that GE has with the Coalition Provisional Authority [ … ] to rebuild the power generation system in Iraq [ is ] about the size of the entire budget of NBC ?
Is that kind of like the napkin rings thing ? ”
And the standards people said “ Huh .
That ’s interesting .
No one ’s brought that up before . ”
Now I ’m not saying that I ’m smart or that I ’m advanced or that I ’m ahead of my colleagues or maybe I had a lot of free time to think about this or maybe I ’m some pinko - proto - lefty like Richard Nixon .
I do n’t know !
But the fact that it drew a complete blank among the NBC standards people was interesting to me .
[ Now ] in fact what happens in the networks — and you can find this at ABC and other networks at well — is that this [ conflict with the profit motive ] manifests itself [ as journalists saying ]
“ Well , we are better reporters because we deal with these kinds of conflicts all the time .
And because we deal with those and we always decide in favor of the audience , it sort of exercises our journalistic muscle . ”
And this is the line you get from all of the entities .
You may or may not be aware that there was a real strong full - court press to sell the media — and I ’m not pro- or against it at this particular point , but there was a process in place where individuals in the media got access to the individuals involved in the planning of the war .
There were generals who came in , there were former secretaries of defense , Schwarzkopf spent a whole lot of time giving sort of off - the - record , quiet briefings .
And the generals would sort of bring in a certain group of editors and reporters and I went to all of these briefings .
At one of them , Hockenberry explains , a well - known pollster told about a briefing he gave to all the senior officials at the White House about how the polling data from the Arab world showed that America ’s negatives were simply off - the - charts .
Everyone was quiet .
Condi asked a few technical questions and then finally Karl Rove spoke up .
“ Well , that ’s just until we start throwing our weight around over there , ” he said .
Hockenberry was stunned and thought they should do a piece on what this revealed into the mentality of the war ’s planners .
But NBC
News did n’t think this was a very good idea .
America wanted the war to happen ; their job was just to wait and see how it turned out .
“ We ’re not particularly interested in the story , ” Hockenberry explains .
“ We ’re a process that ’s trying to maintain people in front of the set , so in a certain sense media at that point was doing its own kind of shock - and - awe that went right along with the war ’s shock - and - awe [ because ] the business is just to grab eyeballs . ”
Later , his team edited together a montage of clips about what it was like for reporters who were still in Iraq to experience the shock - and - awe campaign .
Vibrant images , narrated by a tense reporter who was on the ground at the time .
We played this piece for the editors .
And it was very moving , very powerful , and it was a very different perspective from what we were getting .
And at the end [ … ] there was quiet around the table , because it was kind of an emotional piece and certainly the emotion in this reporter ’s voice was detectable over a satellite phone line .
And the standards person goes — and again , this is his job , I do n’t begrudge him that — he goes , “ Seems like , seems like she has a point of view here . ”
The table was silent .
Just dead silent .
And I was infuriated .
But whenever I get this sort of infuriated feeling I think “ You know , this is a career - ending moment here . ”
There is something I could say that would be right .
There is something I could say that would be wrong .
And there is something that I could say that would be right — and also would be wrong .
And it was the beginning of the coverage of an event that would be extraordinary and I definitely wanted to be around to be a part of the next day ’s coverage , but I had to say something .
And it seemed as though , if nobody said anything , people would go “ well , I guess we ’ll have to tone her down . ”
So I said , “ You mean , the war - is - bad point of view ? ”
The piece aired .
You should follow me on twitter here .

Via Washingtonpost.com :
On Nov. 10 , 2005 , Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales sent a letter to a federal judge in Montana , assuring him that the U.S. attorney there , William W. Mercer , was not violating federal law by spending most of his time in Washington as a senior Justice Department official .
That same day , Mercer had a GOP Senate staffer insert into a bill a provision that would change the rules so that federal prosecutors could live outside their districts to serve in other jobs , according to documents and interviews .
Congress passed the provision several months later as part of the USA Patriot Act reauthorization bill , retroactively benefiting Mercer and a handful of other senior Justice officials who pull double duty as U.S. attorneys and headquarters officials .
Justice officials say the measure was a necessary clarification to ensure that prosecutors could fill temporary postings in Washington , Iraq and elsewhere , and that it also applies to assistant U.S. attorneys .
But the episode , which received little notice at the time , provides another example in which Gonzales 's statements appear to conflict with simultaneous actions by his aides in connection with U.S. attorney policies .
Lawmakers investigating the department 's handling of the dismissal of eight U.S. attorneys have repeatedly accused Gonzales of being less than truthful about the roles played by himself and the White House .
Subject : Defense of Marriage in the Name of the LambFrom : " Patrick Farley " To : comments@whitehouse.gov Date : Tue , June 6 , 2006 Dear Mr. President , I am deeply concerned about the proposed Constitutional Amendment which will define marriage as being strictly between a man and a woman -- for the Book of Revelation CLEARLY states that there is another sanctioned Marriage , the coming Wedding between the city of New Jerusalem and The Lamb .
I urge you to remember this passage from Revelation 21 : " And I John saw the holy city , new Jerusalem , coming down from God out of heaven , prepared as a bride adorned for her husband ...
And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues , and talked with me , saying , Come hither , I will shew thee the bride , the Lamb 's wife .
" This Marriage is , after all , the goal toward which all * true * Christians strive ; I fear we would insult the Almighty if we neglected to codify it into our national law .
For remember too this passage from Revelation 22 : " For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book , if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy , God shall take away his part out of the book of life , and out of the holy city , and from the things which are written in this book !
" Do we dare risk writing our great nation out of the Book of Life by committing the sin of ommission ?
Mr. President , I urge you to veto any Defense of Marriage bill which comes across your desk unless it CLEARLY states that marriage shall only be between a man and a woman , OR between the City of New Jerusalem and The Lamb .
The fate of not just our nation , but our immortal souls , may depend on it .
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with us all .
Amen !
Patrick Sean FarleySan Francisco , CA
While the White House has often denied having a Plan B for Iraq , it turns out that the Pentagon has thought about what to do if Plan A , the " surge " doesnt work .
According to Steve Inskeep and Guy Raz of National Public Radio , plan B would involve maintaining a series of military bases around Iraq with some 30,000 to 40,000 U.S. troops .
That plan would have them stay for decades , under the excuse that they could train the Iraqi troops and deter neighboring countries , such as Iran and Turkey , from sending their own troops into the country .
Already the U.S. has built military compounds that look permanent , supplied with air - conditioning , movie theatres , Starbucks coffee houses , and fast food outlets .
The idea is hardly new .
For the last decade , the neocons have advocated that the U.S. establish bases in Iraq to police the Middle East and make the area safe for Israel .
Although no one is totally certain why the Bush Administration took us into the quagmire of Iraq , it seems plausible that securing bases in that part of the world was one significant factor .
At the time , the U.S. had major military installations in Saudi Arabia ; but they had generated considerable opposition among the Saudis and in the rest of the Arab world , with the result that the Royal family was increasingly desirous of getting rid of them .
In 1998 , Osama Bin Laden issued a Fatwa Urging Jihad Against Americans , ostensibly because American troops were now stationed on " sacred " soil , the land that contains Mecca and Medina .
In the latest Republican debate , Ron Paul raised that issue , only to be widely criticized by the Republican right .
Paul , however , was correct : that was a major factor in 9/11 .
The U.S. strong bias favoring Israel no doubt contributed as well .
The twin towers were not brought down , however , because we attempted to provide equal rights for people of all genders or that we wear immodest clothing and live " immoral " lives .
They were destroyed because of our foreign policy , in particular , because we had troops in Muslim parts of the world .
We now have even more of them and are seen as a new version of the Crusades .
This implies that , if we maintain a strong military presence in Muslim countries , including Iraq , we will continue to generate hatred and terrorism .
Osama and his allies will persist in attacking us .
Permanent or long term bases in Iraq will only bring more fire and brimstone to the world .
The only way to reduce terrorism significantly is to leave the Middle East to the Middle Easterners .
Why are we building the largest embassy in the world in Baghdad ?
Iraq is a relatively small , unimportant , and backward country sitting on a lot of oil .
That the U.S is constructing this mammoth compound tells the world that it is planning to occupy that part of the globe for a long time .
Iraq will become an unofficial colony used to police the rest of the Middle East .
In particular , the U.S. will be watching over Persia or , as it is now called , Iran .
The Persians have a long and great history and will not relish the idea that a western Christian newcomer will be supervising their behavior .
Nor will the Sunni governments in the region look with favor on this " crusading " states attempting to dictate their actions .
The only way to prevent another 9/11 is to vacate the Middle East .
We have no need to be there .
Some would argue that our dependence on foreign oil requires that we control the largest supply of petroleum in the world .
This is untrue ; there is no necessity for America to rule the oil - rich territories .
Countries with large supplies of oil have no use for that fuel except to sell it .
All of those oil - based states have become dependent on the revenues that come from selling it .
They have no choice .
Nothing can be done with that liquid except market it .
Even if radical Islamists take control of one of the petro-states , its government will still have to sell the oil to generate the revenue necessary to maintain its power .
Unfortunately , none of the presidential candidates , with the exception of Ron Paul , understands this .
Even those strongly opposed to the war , such as Congressman John Murtha , advocate " repositioning " our troops , a mantra that keeps being repeated .
In some cases the politicians seem to be talking about moving the troops to self - contained bases in Iraq or in Kurdistan .
In other cases " reposition " means moving the troops over the horizon to the Persian Gulf .
If the idea , however , is to secure peace and stop terrorist attacks on the U.S. , keeping our troops in the Middle East will fail .
It will only generate more terrorism .
We must pull our soldiers back to the United States and stop trying to police the world .
Philip Pullman , the Whitbread award - winning author of His Dark Materials , has condemned children 's television as ' social poison ' , treating its audience as marketing opportunities while portraying them as dangerous and feral .
Pullman castigated broadcasters for sacrificing high - quality programmes in favour of those that yield more marketing opportunities .
' Children are regarded by broadcasters as a marketing opportunity at best , a dangerous and feral threat at worst , and an expensive nuisance otherwise , ' Pullman said .
' This social poison goes much deeper than broadcasting , of course , but it 's particularly visible there .
' There used to be ... a sense of responsibility among broadcasters : a feeling that this extraordinary medium ... should be used to make things better , richer , more interesting for those who made up the audience - especially for children , ' he added .
There are now more than 20 dedicated pay and free - to - air children 's channels , but spending on original children 's programmes on public service channels has declined in real terms by more than a third , while the average cost of producing one hour of original children 's programming fell from £ 85,000 in 1998 to £ 57,000 in 2006 .
ITV responded to this shifting market recently by announcing it would not commission any new children 's programmes , a decision that caused Ofcom to launch a review of children 's programming , the results of which will be published later this year .
But Pullman is concerned the damage done to children 's television has gone too far to be corrected without more effort .
' The ideology of " profit before everything " in children 's television is toxic , ' he said .
' When young audiences are regarded as customers to be separated from their money as quickly and efficiently as possible , there is no chance for life - enhancing work to flourish . '
Much of Pullman 's own work has appeared on television , with the author 's blessing .
When Billie Piper and Julie Walters were confirmed as protagonists in the BBC production of his novel , The Ruby in the Smoke , he said he was delighted , because he had ' always felt that TV , rather than film , was the natural home for the Sally stories ' .
Pullman went on to say that fiction loses its value unless it ' tackles the great moral dilemmas of our time ' .
' Fantasy , and fiction in general , is failing to do what it might be doing , ' he said .
' It has unlimited potential to explore all sorts of metaphysical and moral questions , but it is not doing that .
' You can't leave morality out unless your work is so stupid and trivial and so worthless that nobody would want to read it anyway .
' Taking children 's needs seriously is not different from taking every human need seriously , ' he said .
' It is absolutely central to a true and humane vision of the whole of life .
If we need to challenge the prevailing neo-liberal , market - based religion in order to do it , then we should do so proudly . '
Pullman 's new film , The Golden Compass , starring Daniel Craig and Nicole Kidman , the first of three to be based on the trilogy , His Dark Materials , opens on 7 December .
В четверг на востоке Москвы рухнул Бауманский ( официальное название — « Басманный » ) продовольственный рынок .
Около 5.00 внезапно обрушилась крыша двухуровневого здания на общей площади 13 тыс .
квадратных метров , сообщил прокурор Москвы Анатолий Зуев .
В этот момент в здании шла оптовая торговля , и , по некоторым данным , внутри могли находиться от 100 до 150 человек .
К 12.30 из-под завалов извлечены тела 27 погибших и 25 раненых ,
сообщил журналистам находящийся на месте происшествия глава пресс - службы МЧС России Виктор Бельцов , передает « Интерфакс » .
Рухнувшими конструкциями придавило также 25 припаркованных рядом с рынком машин , в которых находились люди .

По последним данным , два человека доставлены в тяжелом состоянии в реанимационное отделение 36-й клинической больницы , 9 тяжело раненых — в 29 -ю клиническую больницу им .
Баумана , и еще 4 — в клинику НИИ скорой и неотложной помощи им .
Склифосовского .
Они получили переломы ребер , ног и рук , травмы живота , черепно - мозговые травмы , рассказал представитель МЧС .
При этом , по словам находящегося на месте происшествия мэра Москвы Юрия Лужкова , « cреди тех , кто спасен , пока мы москвичей не имеем » .
« Я думаю , что и среди погибших в основном приезжие » , — отметил Лужков .
По данным представителей азербайджанской диаспоры , среди жертв обрушения есть граждане Азербайджана .
По словам вице - президент а Союза азербайджанцев мира Джафар Гасанов , 13 азербайджанцев погибли , еще трое находятся в НИИ скорой помощи им .
Склифосовского , передает « Интерфакс » .
Поисковые работы на месте трагедии продолжаются .
Спасатели пытаются найти под завалами живых людей .
Последняя объявленная минута тишины показала , что там могут находиться еще 11 раненых .
Их ищут с помощью служебных собак , завалы разбирает тяжелая техника .
Как говорят спасатели , людей под завалами очень много , и , вероятнее всего , погибших будет в 2 - 3 раза больше .
Эту информацию подтверждают и работники рынка , очевидцы происшедшего и выжившие .
Как сообщил корреспонденту « Газеты .
Ru » один из чудом спасшихся рабочих , он в момент обрушения находился в центральном проходе на первом этаже .
« Вдруг по проходу пронесся ураган , вырубилось электричество » , — рассказал он .
После этого рабочий спрыгнул в яму -склад , куда подъезжающие фуры обычно сваливают товары .
Именно это и спасло рабочего и еще одного его друга .
Он сказал , что оптовый рынок открывается для покупателей около 4 часов утра , и к 5 часам клиентов было довольно много .
Один из продавцов , работавший под уцелевшим сектором крыши , сказал , что в момент трагедии к нему подошел уже шестой покупатель .
Сейчас рядом со зданием находятся не только спасатели , но и родственники тех , кто мог оказаться в здании в момент трагедии .
Женщины безуспешно пытаются найти мужей , работавших на рынке .
Некоторые из них работали там вместе с мужьями , но им удалось избежать страшной участи .
При этом , работы , по словам спасателей , идут очень сложно – образовавшиеся завалы нужно ликвидировать так , чтобы никто больше не пострадал .
Для людей , которые могут оказаться под ними , с помощью тепловых пушек подается теплый воздух .
Причины трагедии пока неизвестны .
Мэр Москвы Юрий Лужков заявил , что это совершенно точно не теракт .
По предварительным данным , здание рухнуло из - за перегрузки снегом крыши или конструкций здания , « которые были далеко не свежими » ( рынок построен в 1975 году ) , сообщил журналистам Лужков .
« Возможная причина — в том , что крыша имела форму вогнутого купола и большое количество снега , скопившегося на ней привело к обрушению » , — передает РИА « Новости » слова мэра .
В то же время , по его словам , крыша была оборудована специальным стоком и рассчитана на большое количество снега .
« Она не нуждалась в специальной очистке » , — отметил мэр .
Действительно , как говорят очевидцы , кровлю рынка не чистили никогда .
По факту обрушения здания возбуждено уголовное дело по ч.2 ст. 109 УК РФ ( причинение смерти по неосторожности двум и более лицам ) , сообщил прокурор Москвы Анатолий Зуев .
По его словам , рассматриваются три основные версии происшедшего : нарушение правил эксплуатации , ненадлежащее исполнение обязанностей должностными лицами при осмотре технического состояния здания и неверное конструктивное решение при проектировании .
Последняя версия , по- видимому , будет рассмотрена наиболее внимательно .
Обрушившееся здание было спроектировано архитектором Нодаром Канчели — он же работал и над конструкцие й
Трансвааль - Парка , рухнувшего 14 февраля 2004 года .
Глава МЧС Сергей Шойгу уже заявил , что , по его данным , причиной трагедии , скорее всего , стало конструктивное нарушение .
Правда , по слова м Лужкова , после обрушения аквапарка были проверены все здания , спроектированыне этим архитектором , в том числе и Басманный рынок .
При этом здание рынка совсем недолго не дожило до перестройки .
По словам Лужкова , на его месте было запланировано строительство нового здания .

On her very first Saturday night in the city last March , at a clandestine Japanese lounge operating without a liquor license in Midtown , Ms. Mimura ordered a drink more appropriate to the girl she still was than the woman she aspired to be : milk and Malibu rum .
She had arranged to meet a fellow student from her first hip - hop class who went by the nickname Smiles , and a friend of his .
Before their arrival , Ms. Mimura confided , “ I want American boyfriend . ”
She spent those first weeks struggling to learn her way around the city .
She found it difficult to navigate the subway or to find Internet access .
For a month , she slept on the couch in the Brooklyn apartment of her best friend from childhood , a design student at LaGuardia Community College .
The two women spent hours in deep conversation .
Ms. Mimura wrote in her diary about her ex-boyfriend and why he had abandoned her .
In one entry , which she allowed a reporter to read with the help of a translator , she confided that she had been needy and insecure around the boyfriend .
Six months after the breakup , it was still hard to let go .
She phoned him from New York and they talked about why their romance had ended .
“ I still need him , ” Ms. Mimura said .
One night , Ms. Mimura went to the East Village club Sin Sin , at a monthly party called “ Soulgasm , ” where a well - known dancer , Henry Link of Elite Force Crew ( who has danced for Michael Jackson and Mariah Carey ) , often shows up .
The party is popular with young Japanese women interested in hip - hop culture .
About 1 a.m. Mr. Link appeared , dressed in a T - shirt and track pants , and soon a circle formed around him as he danced .
From time to time challengers stepped into the circle to battle , using their own dance moves , with crowd reaction measuring their success .
Ms. Mimura bounced with anticipation .
In Japan , she never would have tried such a thing , but when an opening came she handed her beer to a bystander and plunged into the circle .
Mr. Link stood back in admiration , and spectators nodded and clapped .
Image Bank
BY ANY measure , Goldman Sachs is a formidable company .
The bank knocks the spots off its competitors , whether in pure “ investment banking ” , the traditional craft of underwriting and mergers and acquisitions in which it made its name , or in its new focus , trading for customers and its own account .
Even compared with leaders in other industries , Goldman makes spectacular returns .
Among its latest record - busting yardsticks was a 40 % quarterly return on equity .
The average pay - packet of its 24,000 staff last year was $ 520,000 — and that includes a lot of assistants and secretaries .
This makes the bank an easy target for populist politicians and tabloid newspapers .
The real reason why Goldman should matter to outsiders is not because it is a manufacturer of millionaires ( good luck to it ) ; but because it stands at the centre of a two - decade - long transformation of the financial markets and a new approach to risk .
Business risks that were once seen as a lumpy fact of life are now routinely sliced up and packaged into combinations that generally suit issuers and investors alike .
At the heart of the change has been the development of huge markets in swaps , derivatives and other complex and often opaque instruments that allow the transfer of risk from one party to another .
From small beginnings in 1987 , the face value of contracts in interest - rate and currency derivatives is now more than $ 200 trillion — 16 times America 's GDP .
A further $ 17 trillion is outstanding in ( even newer ) credit - default swaps , which allow bond investors to lay off the risk of issuers defaulting .
Led by Goldman , investment banks have innovated at a furious pace and changed the mix of their own businesses .
They have taken on more risk as they have moved from more transparent markets , in which margins are slim , to more profitable portfolios of derivatives and direct private - equity investments .
The face value of Goldman 's derivatives exposure is more than $ 1 trillion , although the bank says that its net exposure , once you offset all its positions , is $ 58 billion , against shareholders ' funds of $ 28 billion .
The bankers ' innovations have brought huge rewards to their industry .
In the past decade it has garnered revenues of more than $ 125 billion , more than three times the level in the previous decade .
Simply the best
This huge new risk industry has produced gains for people far away from Wall Street and the City of London .
Car companies have been able to hedge away many risks that once were seen as an incurable part of the business — and thus focus on what they do best .
Pension funds have been able to shape their portfolios to fit their appetite for risk .
Friction is bad for economies ; the risk industry reduces it to all our benefits .
Yet the sheer size of the numbers involved does mean it is worth raising three questions .
How exactly has Goldman and its industry achieved this ?
Can it be sustained ?
And what should happen if something goes wrong ?
Like most of its rivals , Goldman is a difficult institution for outsiders to understand .
Until 1999 it was a private partnership .
With public ownership came greater reporting responsibilities , but precisely what Goldman is up to remains obscure .
The bank likes to say that it still relies a lot on traditional investment banking , but Goldman 's accounts show that its profits come increasingly from trading .
The sharp - suited investment bankers act as a sales force for less - well - dressed colleagues who work out how to make money from swaps , options and direct investments ( see article ) .
Goldman was not the first to realise that new financial techniques had the potential to alter risk management for companies of all kinds .
Bankers Trust , now part of Deutsche Bank , was arguably quickest off the mark .
But once it joined the risk - management game , Goldman steadily accumulated market nous .
It applied this by building a proprietary technology system , shunning the off - the - shelf products used by many of its competitors .
People who have left Goldman say that this system is unmatched at rivals .
One consequence is that Goldman seems confident that it can take more risks than its competitors do .
Its trading revenues are the most volatile among big investment banks and it has the most days when it loses money .
Overall , however , it makes the most money .
Inside the black box
But for how long ?
The market doubts the run of huge profits can last .
Goldman 's shares are valued less richly than those of competitors it so obviously outwits .
Moreover , investment banks are less highly valued than less glamorous commercial banks and retail brokerage firms .
This could be because investors think Goldman will struggle to sustain the breakneck innovation that keeps it ahead of others .
Goldman 's ascendancy is already showing stresses — most recently the struggle to manage conflicts of interests across its business lines .
Hank Paulson , Goldman 's boss , recently chastised its London team of investment bankers for appearing too aggressive in their offers to buy companies , thereby threatening the bank 's reputation for being an adviser .
In Japan , for just this reason , some of Goldman 's M&A customers have deserted it for rivals .
These kerfuffles show that conflicts of interest can probably be solved by market pressure rather than intervention by regulators .
A bigger problem for both investors and regulators has to do with risk itself .
Outsiders — and perhaps even insiders — find it hard to judge whether Goldman 's business is sustainably good or has thrived thanks to a dose of unsustainable good luck and skill .
In addition , the very improvements in risk management that have spread risk far and wide make it harder to know where risk is concentrated or how risks might combine to threaten the system 's overall health .
So far central banks have concluded that the system is more robust than it was .
But the trading models that have propelled Goldman will be tested one day .
At worst , the bank itself — or , more likely , a second - tier rival or a hedge fund — might fall into the kind of dramatic spiral that killed off Long - Term Capital Management ( LTCM ) , a hedge fund , in the late 1990s .
Financial markets have always been subject to crises .
Any crisis would affect Goldman , because it is so intertwined with the system .
The bank says it keeps plenty of liquid reserves against the dread day .
It might well profit from any crisis ( it did from LTCM ) .
But the chances are that some banks , somewhere , will get into serious trouble .
If that happens , the losses of any bank will be for its shareholders ; they should not expect any bail - out .
The wider question has to do with systemic risk .
If the much vaunted systems do not work , then the central banks will have to step in ( as the Federal Reserve did with LTCM ) .
In the past , though , such collapses did less damage to the financial system than the regulatory over - reaction that followed them .
If policymakers were to respond to the next crisis by ushering in a more conservative regime that severely limited financial risk - modelling and risk - management , the global economy would be the poorer for it .
That is what should stick in people 's minds when the day comes .
Until then , why not do something too often forgotten ?
Love Goldman or hate it , you ought to admire it and the system it epitomises .
And hang on tight .
Husband and wife used the codenames David and Deborah
Carlos Alvarez , 61 , and his 56 - year - old wife , Elsa , received a five and three - year term respectively for exchanging coded messages with Cuba .
Both said they took responsibility for their actions but had wanted to establish an open dialogue with Cuba .
But a Miami district judge said that their behaviour had undermined US foreign policy towards the country .
" As we know , a good motive is never an excuse for criminal conduct , " Miami Judge Michael Moore said before he sentenced the couple .
The pair were accused of sending coded messages about fellow Cuban - American exiles living in Miami back to Cuba .
Carlos Alvarez was accused of being in contact with Cuban intelligence agencies since 1977 .
' Innocuous information '
The psychology professor , based at Florida International University , disguised his identity using the codename David .
His wife also communicated with Cuban agents under the name Deborah but to a lesser extent than her husband .
Before being sentenced , Carlos Alvarez told the court he had once been part of an underground movement that sought to oust Castro 's regime but that he later became " an advocate of dialogue . "
" I decided to engage in a relation that would require sharing what I consider innocuous information and analysis for access , " he said , adding , " The method and channel that I used were unfortunately wrong . "
Carlos Alvarez 's lawyer claimed that the messages included no secret , classified or defence material and often amounted to no more than " simple gossip " .
But US lawyer Matthew Axelord said that the pair had gone to great lengths to conceal their actions .
" This was not idle chit - chat , " he said , " Carlos Alvarez was tasked directly by the Cuban intelligence service to provide certain information and he provided that information . "
I resume my call to impeach Alberto Gonzales .
In an interview today with The Seattle Times , fired U.S. Attorney John McKay recalls this :
McKay said he began to have concerns about politics entering the Justice Department in early 2005 , when Gonzales addressed all of the country 's U.S. attorneys in Scottsdale , Ariz . , shortly after he took over as attorney general .
" His first speech to us was a ' you work for the White House ' speech , " McKay recalled . " ' I work for the White House , you work for the White House . ' " McKay said he thought at the time , " He could n't have meant that speech , " given the traditional independence of U.S. Attorneys .
" It turns out he did . "
He looked around the meeting room and caught the eyes of his colleagues , who gave him looks of surprise at Gonzales ' remarks .
" We were stunned at what he was saying . "
If Gonzales understood anything about being Attorney General , it was that he had to keep at least the appearance of independence from the White House .
And it was all about that appearance in his opening statement at his confirmation hearing :
With the consent of the Senate , I will no longer represent only the White House ; I will represent the United States of America and its people .
I understand the differences between the two roles .
In the former , I have been privileged to advise the president and his staff ; in the latter , I would have a far broader responsibility : to pursue justice for all the people of our great nation , to see that the laws are enforced in a fair and impartial manner for all Americans .
Wherever we pursue justice , from the war on terror to corporate fraud to civil rights , we must always be faithful to the rule of law .
And this was about appearances , too , from the same day of testimony :
And I feel a special obligation , maybe an additional burden coming from the White House to reassure the career people at the department , and to reassure the American people that that I 'm not going to politicize the Department of Justice .
" I work for the White House , you work for the White House . "
Alberto Gonzales perjured himself in his confirmation hearing !
He did not believe what he was telling the Senate Judiciary , he lied through his teeth in expressing his commitment to the pursuit of justice over the pursuit of his boss 's political whims .
Never again can a White House counsel be made Attorney General .
Never again can a real estate lawyer turned presidential lackey be elevated to a position where he or she can so much damage to our country .
And this particular Attorney General is not fit to serve .
Impeach Gonzales .
( H/T TPMmuckraker )
Yet , he continued , the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that Congress and the executive branch , in exercising their broad power over naturalization and immigration , can make rules that would be unacceptable if applied to American citizens .
In the judge 's view , the government has the right to detain people indefinitely as long as their eventual removal is " reasonably foreseeable . "
If that interpretation stands , it could apply to millions of noncitizens , including tourists removable for visa violations , said Gerald L. Neuman , a law professor at Columbia who is an expert in human rights law and was not involved in the case .
" It does n't seem to limit the motives the government has to have in being slow in removing them ; it could even be just basic neglect , " he said .
But Professor Neuman cautioned that " it 's only a district judge 's decision . "
" The decision encourages the government to behave this way without fear of financial liability , " he said , but it does not carry the weight of a ruling by an appellate court .
" This interpretation is attackable even among other judges in Brooklyn , let alone Lower Manhattan . "
But David Cole , a law professor at Georgetown University and a co-counsel in the lawsuit , said the ruling was the only one of its kind and made New York " an equal protection - free zone " because the government can detain immigrants wherever it chooses .
" What this decision says is the next time there is a terror attack , the government is free to round up every Muslim immigrant in the U.S. , based solely on their ethnic and religious identity , and hold them on immigration pretexts for as long as it desires , " he said .
" We saw after 9/11 what the government did in an era of uncertainty about how far it can go .
Judge Gleeson has essentially given them a green light to go much further . "
The class - action lawsuit , Turkmen v. Ashcroft , is the first and largest of several brought by immigrants held after 9/11 .
The named plaintiffs in the case include former detainees who came back to the United States this year for depositions and were required to be in the custody of federal marshals at all times .
Among them were Hany Ibrahim , a deli worker , and his brother , Yasser , a Web designer , Egyptian Muslims who said then that putting themselves back in the hands of the government they were suing was an act of faith in America .
If you ’ve ever been to Disney World , you ’ve noticed that employees ( cast members ) all wear name badges that are typically first name with the home town under the name .
It ’s been a very effective consumer activity , one which almost everybody in the industry followed .
Guests would delight in seeing somebody from their state and / or home town .
Wait staff would tell you about people who would tip more and kids would play the equivalent of the license plate game , tracking down people from where they live , all over the parks .
It was an amazingly subtle but effective brand / marketing activity for the Mouse .
I say was because they ditched it .
Yup .
Some marketing wonk in Disney decided to take that little tiny piece of brand real estate and change it .
Because of the 50 year celebration , they re-issued all of the name tags so that you saw a branding message about the happiest celebration on earth .
Uh Huh .
The net effect of this exercise ?
Pissed off employees and customers talking more about this ‘ loss ’ and talking about the pissed off employees vs. talking about the happiest celebration on earth .
It was fascinating to ask employees “ What happened to the name badges ” and watch the robot - like smiles turn to growls as they complained about the “ jerks , goofs , idiots , morons , and those people in head office ” .
Ah , yep , those would be quotes .
Disney , the master at controlling the message , making everybody happy happy , has hundreds , if not thousands of ‘ cast members ’ all grumbling outwardly to the customers .
I randomly asked 20 employees at the various parks and , to the person , got a grumbling , growling , not happy answer , all pointing fingers at , well , see the above list .
The more important observation ?
The guests walking around talking about it .
In lines , people would ask the employee in front of the Ride .
At the gift shops , people were asking the clerks .
At the restaurants , you guessed it , people were asking the staff about it .
The responses , as you can imagine , were not pleasant .
Ranging from the polite , yes it is a change , to the more direct home office moron alert .
While not up there with the New Coke Old Coke mess , it is a pretty interesting lesson in how the front office , you , often gets completely disconnected with what actually is going on and what actually matters to people on both sides of your counter .
So , boys and girls , Mickey says the lesson for today is :
Pay attention to what really matters when it comes to your employees and guests .
You ’re likely to be amazed at what you find .
Memo to Seth :
They have really really clean fire trucks at Disney World .
The downturn in the US housing market will force businesses to slash 73,000 jobs a month in the new year and could be more damaging to the world economy than the dotcom crash , economists have warned .
After official figures last week showed that the number of new homes sold in July was 22 per cent lower than a year earlier , while prices were almost flat , fears are mounting that the ' orderly ' housing slowdown predicted by the Federal Reserve will become a full - blown crash .
' Things do seem to be getting worse very quickly .
Freefall is a strong word , but I think it 's the right one to use here , ' said Paul Ashworth , chief US economist at Capital Economics .
House prices have been rising at unprecedented double - digit rates in recent years , giving homeowners massive windfalls and supporting a wave of investment in new construction .
However , the number of unsold new homes is now at a 10 - year high .
Ashworth reckons 30 per cent of all the jobs created since the end of the last recession in 2001 - 1.4 million - have been in sectors related to the housing market boom , from construction to DIY stores .
As the boom runs out of steam , Capital calculates that 73,000 jobs a month will be lost .
The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged for the first time in 18 meetings earlier this month , as chairman Ben Bernanke weighed the risks of high inflation and the threat to growth from the long - expected housing market crunch .
Stephen Roach , chief economist at Morgan Stanley , predicts that the property slowdown will shave at least 2 percentage points off GDP growth next year , taking the US perilously close to recession , as construction spending plummets and homeowners lose the cushion of extra wealth that comes from rapid price rises .
' For a wealth - dependent US economy , the bursting of another major asset bubble is likely to be a very big deal , ' he said , warning that , with US fiscal and trade imbalances now larger than five years ago , the fallout for the rest of the world could be more devastating than the aftermath of the dotcom boom .
' A bursting of the property bubble poses equally serious risks for America 's key trading partners and for the rest of an increasingly integrated global economy , ' he added .
Anxieties about the fragile US housing sector come as analysts in the UK debate whether this month 's rise in interest rates will dent prices here .
Property website Hometrack will warn tomorrow that the so - called ' mini - boom ' that has buoyed the market in London over the past few months will be snuffed out by higher mortgage costs .
Fionnuala Earley , group economist at Nationwide , said she believed the market could ride out the rate hike , but expects it to slow going into the new year .
' There are supportive factors : buy - to - let figures are strong , and immigration suggests there 's going to be tenant demand , and there are property supply constraints , ' she said .
' But if the MPC 's raising rates , it 's a warning shot , and people are going to think again about whether they should move and whether they should stretch themselves . '
Ah , the MRE .
That portable , “ tasty ” meal eaten by US troops in the field , or when one ’s unit does n’t have anything else with which to feed people .
As someone who has been in the military , I ’ve eaten my share of them .
They seem really cool at first , but that coolness factor wears off after about your second or third MRE .
That ’s when they start tasting the same .
A few years ago , my Air National Guard unit went to South Dakota for a two - week training exercise with the Army .
During that time we had three meals a day : one hot meal and two MREs .
Because we were in the Air Force and not the Army , we were n’t too keen on playing Army games and pretending we were at war .
So we would leave our compound and go to McDonald ’s or something similar for one of those meals .
This resulted in a large collection of MREs for myself .
After sitting in my basement at room temperature for the last three years , a good friend of mine really wanted to try one .
So , I decided to document his experience for you all to see .
Here is the tasty meal we picked out : Beef with Mushrooms .
There are about 24 different MREs out there right now .
The military tends to phase out the most unpopular ones after a few years .
I checked the latest MRE menu and the last time Beef with Mushrooms MREs were made was back in 2002 .
That makes this MRE at least five years old .
Here are the contents of the MRE .
There are a few things that are common to all MREs and a few things that are different in each one .
All come with matches , salt , sugar , a napkin , a moist towelette , coffee , creamer , a spoon , gum , Tabasco Sauce , and a flameless heater .
The items that are unique to this MRE are the main course items , oatmeal cookies , crackers , cocoa mix , and strawberry jam .
Other MREs might have jalapeño cheese spread instead of strawberry jam or Skittles instead of oatmeal cookies .
The first thing we tried was the crackers .
We decided to put a little of the strawberry jam on them for taste .
One thing MRE food lacks is flavor so anything you can enhance the taste is always a plus .
The jam was n’t too bad but the crackers were a little dry so we put those off to the side to fix our main course .
One cool thing about the MRE is that you do n’t have to eat your food cold .
Each one comes with a flameless heater .
Just add water .
Once the chemical reaction starts you can put in your meal pouches .
The heater is surprisingly effective and will get so hot that it can burn you if you are n’t careful .
The water will actually start boiling and steaming after about a minute .
Unfortunately , it is quite difficult to warm up the entire meal .
Most of the heat is distributed unevenly throughout the food .
Once the rice pouch was heated my friend dug in .
According to him it was n’t too bad .
I guess it ’s pretty hard to screw up rice .
This is the main course .
The actual beef and mushrooms .
Yes , the food actually looks this disgusting in real life .
It had the consistency of dog food .
There ’s also something unsettling about eating this stuff with a spoon , as if to add insult injury .
One would think that the manufacturer could have at least supplied a spork .
This is why every MRE comes with Tabasco Sauce .
At least that ’s my opinion on the matter .
People typically use it to hide the horrible taste or to bring out the “ flavor ” in the bland food .
As you can see from the picture , the bottle is quite small so one must decide beforehand which food is the most disgusting and use it on that .
These oatmeal cookies are the “ dessert ” .
Sometimes MREs will come with surprisingly good deserts .
The mint pound cake is surprisingly tasty and is especially prized .
These cookies , however , were not tasty in the least .
They were bland ( surprise ) and fell apart when I took a bite out of one .
In conclusion , I hope you have enjoyed this little MRE play - by - play .
Most MREs do n’t taste too bad , but they do n’t taste too good either .
Also keep in mind that this particular MRE has been discontinued .
You can actually buy MREs in some camping stores and on eBay , but they are a little pricey .
I think they usually go for about $ 7.25 each , which is a little pricey for a crappy meal .

Seattle
I ONCE had a friend who did sex work , which is a nice way of saying that he was a prostitute .
He was based in Los Angeles and one of his clients was a movie star .
Not just any movie star , but a top male movie star .
A sex symbol .
This guy used to fly my friend first class to far - flung locales , usually to unwind after a big location shoot .
Sorry , but I ca n’t tell you who this movie star is .
It ’s not that I ’m afraid of being sued or that I disapprove of outing .
Nope , the reason I ca n’t tell you the name of this movie star is , well , I do n’t know it .
No matter how many times I asked , no matter how much I pried , my friend simply would n’t tell me the guy ’s name .
My friend would n’t even tell me where he was meeting his famous client , lest the places where his films were being shot offered a telling clue .
My friend took the callboy ’s code of silence seriously .
Besides the sheer scale of the hypocrisy , the Ted Haggard scandal does n’t tell us much we do n’t already know about closeted gay or bisexual men ; closet cases will take enormous risks to get their needs met and will often do great harm to themselves and to those they profess to love .
What ’s new in the Haggard scandal — perhaps we should call it a flameout — is the refusal of Mike Jones , a former male prostitute , to honor the callboy ’s code of silence , the omertà of gay hookerdom .

In court documents filed with the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond , Va. , the Justice Department said a new anti-terrorism law being used to hold detainees in Guantanamo Bay also applies to foreigners captured and held in the United States .
Immigrants arrested in the United States may be held indefinitely on suspicion of terrorism and may not challenge their imprisonment in civilian courts , the Bush administration said Monday , opening a new legal front in the fight over the rights of detainees .
" It 's pretty stunning that any alien living in the United States can be denied this right , " said Jonathan Hafetz , an attorney for Al - Marri .
" It means any non-citizen , and there are millions of them , can be whisked off at night and be put in detention . "
The practice of detaining people incommunicado has been condemned by human rights bodies , including the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture , as a human rights violation which can lead to other violations such as torture or ill - treatment or interrogation without due process safeguards .
Access to a lawyer is an important safeguard to ensure that detainees ’ rights are protected , not only with regard to criminal or other proceedings , but also with regard to conditions of detention and a detainee ’s physical and mental health .
Prolonged incommunicado detention or solitary confinement can in itself be a form of cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment .
The Bush administration 's treatment of Ali Saleh Kahlah al - Marri ought to be shocking and horrifying .
Instead , it is now not only depressingly familiar , but also something that is formally sanctioned by the U.S. Congress .
In 2001 , al - Marri , a citizen of Qatar , was in the United States legally , on a student visa .
He was a computer science graduate student at Bradley University in Peoria , Illinois , where he had earned an undergraduate degree a decade earlier .
In Peoria , he lived with his wife and five children .
In December , 2001 he was detained as a " material witness " to suspected acts of terrorism and ultimately charged with various terrorism - related offenses , mostly relating to false statements the FBI claimed he made as part of its 9/11 investigation .
Al - Marri vehemently denied the charges , and after lengthy pre-trial proceedings , his trial on those charges was scheduled to begin on July 21 , 2003 .
But his trial never took place , because in June , 2003 -- one month before the scheduled trial -- President Bush declared him to be an " enemy combatant . "
As a result , the Justice Department told the court it wanted to turn him over to the U.S. military , and thus asked the court to dismiss the criminal charges against him , and the court did so ( the dismissal was " with prejudice , " meaning he can't be tried ever again on those charges ) .
Thus , right before his trial , the Bush administration simply removed Al - Marri from the jurisdiction of the judicial system -- based solely on the unilateral order of the President -- and thus prevented him from contesting the charges against him .
Instead , the administration immediately transferred al - Marri to a miltiary prison in South Carolina ( where the administration brings its " enemy combatants " in order to ensure that the executive - power - friendly 4th Circuit Court of Appeals has jurisdiction over all such cases ) .
Al - Marri was given the " Padilla Treatment " -- kept in solitary confinement , denied all contact with the outside world , including even his own attorneys , not charged with any crimes , and given no opportunity to prove his innocence .
Instead , the Bush administration simply asserted the right to detain him indefinitely without so much as charging him with anything .
Last month , Congress endorsed this behavior and expressly vested the President with the power of indefinite , unreviewable detentions when it enacted the so - called Military Commissions Act of 2006 .
And the Bush administration has wasted no time relying on that statutory authority to justify the exercise of this extreme detention power .
From the AP today
The MCA authorizes the administration to detain any non-citizen ( at least ) as an enemy combatant and does not require that they be charged with any crime nor given an opportunity to prove their innocence .
That includes resident aliens and foreigners who have legally entered the U.S. : This is not a case of someone being detained on a battlefield or even overseas , nor is it the case of someone who entered the country illegally .
He was in the U.S. legally and was detained while sitting at home .
And just as he was about to start his criminal trial , the President essentially cancelled the trial and ordered him detained indefinitely and incommunicado .
As Amnesty International has said with respect to this case : Sermons like that about the value of basic individual rights and the imperatives of due process were previously delivered by the United States .
Now , they need to be delivered to us , because we seem to have rejected them .
The denial of habeas corpus rights is the most Draconian aspect of the MCA , as it authorizes detention for life with no real review and no meaningful opportunity to prove one 's innocence .
Sen .
Chris Dodd said prior to the election that he regrets the decision not to filibuster the MCA : " I regret now that I did n't do it . . .
This is a major , major blow to who we are . "
And Sen . Pat Leahy , soon - to - be Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , has confirmed that he is " drafting a bill to undo portions of a recently passed law that prevent terrorism detainees from going to federal court to challenge the government 's right to hold them indefinitely .
" That has to happen .
At the very least , re-establishing habeas corpus rights for detainees is an absolute imperative .
We simply cannot be a country that vests in the President the power to order people imprisoned for life with no real review of the charges against them , particularly when the detainees are not detained on any battlefield , and particularly when they are detained inside the U.S.
There is no greater betrayal of the core principles of American political life than to have the federal government sweep people off the streets , throw them into a black hole with no contact with the outside world and no charges asserted of any kind , and simply keep them there for as long as the President desires -- in al - Marri 's case , with respect to detention , now five years and counting As always , the most extraordinary and jarring aspect of cases like this one is that these principles -- which were once the undebatable , immovable bedrock of our political system -- are now openly debated and actively disputed by our own government .
By itself it is astonishing -- and highly revealing about where we are as a country -- that such precepts even need to be defended at all .
How to turn your blog in to an OpenID
Would n’t it be great if you could use the same account to log in to multiple sites and applications , without having to trust them all with your password ?
Would n’t it be even better if you could do this without having to hand ownership of your online identity over to some monolithic third party ?
( I ’m looking at you , .NET Passport Microsoft Passport Windows Live ID . )
The good news is , you can !
OpenID is a decentralised authentication system invented by LiveJournal but now being developed as an open standard under the careful mentorship of the Apache Software Foundation .
Anyone can create an OpenID , and the number of sites which let you log in with one is growing by the day .
An OpenID is simply a URL .
My OpenID is simonwillison.net , the address of my weblog .
I can use it to sign in to any site that supports OpenID , and because I ’m the only person with control over my weblog ’s homepage I ’m the only person who can use that identity .
If you want your own OpenID ( and you should ) , here ’s how to get one .
1. Sign up with an OpenID provider
OpenID is decentralised , which means that anyone can set themselves up as an OpenID provider .
You can run your own server if you want to ( phpMyID is one way of doing that ) but there are a number of free services that will host an ID for you .
Those include :
LiveJournal .
They invented it , and if you have a LiveJournal account you already have an OpenID — it ’s the URL of your journal .
I ’m swillison.livejournal.com .
Vox — Six Apart ’s sexy new social network thang .
I ’m simon.vox.com .
VeriSign Labs , who have done some excellent work around OpenID and run a provider as part of their Personal Identity Provider service .
I ’m swillison.pip.verisignlabs.com .
MyOpenID , run by JanRain , authors of the most widely used OpenID libraries .
I ’m swillison.myopenid.com .
If you already have an account with Vox or LiveJournal you can skip straight to step 2 .
If not , pick the provider that you trust the most and create an account there .
This is n’t a permanent decision : you can move provider at any time without losing your account , provided you follow step 2 .
2 . Point your own site at your new OpenID
Here comes the magic .
Having picked your provider and created an OpenID there , edit the HTML of your weblog ’s homepage ( or indeed whichever URL you want to use as your personal OpenID ) and add the following to the document < head > :
< link rel= " openid.server " href = " http://www.livejournal.com/openid/server.bml " > < link rel= " openid.delegate " href = " http://swillison.livejournal.com/ " >
Replace the openid . delegate href with the OpenID at your provider , and the openid . server href with that provider ’s OpenID server .
You can find the server by viewing source on your OpenID page there , or by using this table :
OpenID Provider Server URL LiveJournal http://www.livejournal.com/openid/server.bml
Vox http://www.vox.com/services/openid/server
VeriSign https://pip.verisignlabs.com/server
MyOpenID http://www.myopenid.com/server
This delegation mechanism is key to OpenID ’s status as a truly decentralised authentication system .
If you decide you no longer trust your identity provider you can switch to another one by just editing a couple of lines of HTML — your OpenID will stay the same .
3 . Log in to something !
Now that you have an OpenID , you can use it to log in to all sorts of sites .
Find their OpenID login form and enter your new OpenID — that ’s the URL of your weblog .
You will be redirected to a page on your identity provider which will either ask you to log in or ask you to authorize the site to use your identity .
Click “ Yes ” and you ’ll be sent back to the original site and magically logged in — no password required .
I ’ve been collecting a list of sites that allow you to log in using OpenID under the openidconsumer tag ; sites you may have heard of include Ma.gnolia , Zooomr and Wikitravel .
OpenID on simonwillison.net
This whole entry is a round - about way of announcing the addition of OpenID support to my weblog engine .
You can sign in here ; once signed in you ’ll be able to leave comments with a pretty OpenID logo ( proving that they came from you ) and track recent comments that you ’ve posted on the Your Comments page .
I ’m working on adding other functionality for logged - in users such as the ability to edit your own comments or for trusted users to flag comment spam .
This kind of light - weight account mechanism is one of the things that makes OpenID so interesting .
I doubt I could convince anyone to create a new account just to access a few features on my weblog , but if they already have an OpenID the overhead of logging in is small enough that I ’m hopeful at least a few people will give it a go .
As always , report any bugs in the comments .
Update : I ’ve created a screencast showing how to use OpenID .
But last week , as it happens , C - Span did contact the speaker ’s office to have it take down a different clip from her blog — one shot by C - Span ’s cameras at a House Science and Technology Committee hearing on global warming where Ms. Pelosi testified , Mr. Daly said .
( The blog has substituted material filmed by the committee ’s cameras , he said . )
C - Span , a private nonprofit company financed by the cable and satellite affiliates that carry its programming , says that over more than 25 years of operating it has consistently asserted its copyright to any material it shoots with its own cameras .
But that message can get lost .
“ We are structurally burdened , in terms of people ’s perception , because we are the only network that has such a big chunk of public domain material , ” said Bruce Collins , the corporate vice president and general counsel of C - Span .
He estimated that 5 to 15 percent of C - Span ’s programming is from the House and Senate floor , and thus publicly available .
“ It is perfectly understandable to me that people would be confused , ” he said .
“ They say , ‘ When a congressman says something on the floor it is public domain , but he walks down the street to a committee hearing or give a speech and it is not public domain ? ’ ”
The issue is of recent vintage for C - Span .
In May , C - Span said that it had for first time asserted its copyright against a video - clip site , ordering YouTube to take down copies of Stephen Colbert ’s pointed speech in front of President Bush at the White House Correspondents ’ Association dinner .
Clips of the speech had been viewed 2.7 million times on YouTube in the 48 hours before it was taken down .
Why You Shop At Wal - Mart : Economics Eats Itself
There is a theory ( quite an elegant one , actually ) that says that because we live in a marketplace of free choices we end up getting basically what we want — our dollars are like votes for the society we wish to live in .
Many have challenged this view , from a variety of perspectives , but Tom Slee ( who calls this notion MarketThink ) has chosen to focus on just one : the economic subfield of “ game theory ” .
In his elegant little book , the poorly - titled No One Makes You Shop At Wal - Mart , Slee walks through the major discoveries of game theory , explains them in simple language with reference to a fictional town of Whimsley , and discusses how they refute standard economic conclusions while still playing by basic economic assumptions with effects that appear to show up in the real world .
Take the problem of littering , for example .
The town of Whimsley has a large park between its coffee shop and its office building .
Residents can toss their empty coffee cups on the ground in the park , thereby saving themselves the trouble of carrying it but minutely spoiling the park , or they can carry it to the trash at the office , saving the park but bothering their hands .
In the absence of anyone else , each resident is better off tossing their cup — the bother of carrying it is much more than the small amount of spoilage .
But if everyone does this , the park is quickly full of litter .
Each individual , acting perfectly rationally , creates a situation that none of them want .
A similar problem gives the book its title .
Imagine you get some utility from having a vibrant downtown of independent shops .
Then a Wal - Mart opens up on the outskirts of town .
You begin shopping at the Wal - Mart because the prices are cheaper and you can still walk through the vibrant downtown when you like .
But with everyone buying things at Wal - Mart , the downtown stores can no longer afford to stay open and the center of your city turns into an empty husk .
You ’d prefer to have the vibrant downtown to the Wal - Mart , but nobody ever gave you that choice .
The book is full of dozens of examples like this , each with careful analysis and clear writing .
Perhaps the most odd feature of the book is its politics .
On the one hand , Slee is plainly a committed leftist , with positive references to Naomi Klein and other capitalist critics .
But on the other hand , he never gives up on the rational actor and methodological individualist assumptions of modern economics , and shows little patience for those ( typically his political allies ) who have more thorough - going critiques .
Nonetheless , the book is a recommended read for anyone interested in these questions .
Online Bonus : Watch Tom Slee eviscerate Chris Anderson ’s inbox - stuffer , The Long Tail on his weblog , Whimsley .
Because , remember folks , “ Abundance , like growth itself , is a force that is changing our world in ways that we experience every day , whether we have an equation to describe it or not . ” ( p. 146 )

God 's Contintent , Christianity , Islam and Europe 's Religious Crisis 5/18/2007 08:33:00 PM

God 's Contintent , Christianity , Islam and Europe 's Religious Crisis
Philip Jenkins '
In fact , I recommend anyone interested in Islam & Europe to buy it and read it !
It is dense on data and citation , and the narrative benefits from the author 's multi-faceted understanding of the history and development of religions and religious institutions .
While Jenkins ' previous two books ,
Despite the occasional lapses from objectivity , his most biting rebuttals seem to be aimed at American conservatives who glory in visions of Eurabia .
There are numerous quotations of Front Page Magazine , Mark Steyn and Claire Berlinski , mostly to emphasize the exaggerations and substantive weakness of the claims .
evangelical Christians vs. Muslims in Europe , inclusive of the Russian Federation :
Some Religious Minorities in Europe ( includes Russia )
1900 1970 2000 2025 Muslims 2.3 % 2.7 % 4.3 % 5.1 % Evangelicals , Charismatics and Pentecostals 8 % 4.6 % 8.2 % 9.8 %
The author 's point in offering these data is that no one speaks of the evangelical " bounce back " in Europe , even though it is a reality , and numerically more significant than the Muslim presence .
Jenkins does suggest that there are those on the Left who are wedded to the Secularization Hypothesis , and continue to view religion as the opium of the masses which is naturally going to fade away .
And so they dismiss , ignore , or minimize , the vitality of Christian religious movements within the continent .
But it seems his greater irritation is toward American conservatives , who prematurely mourn a religious civilization as if it is dead and buried for the sake of politics and propaganda .
Jenkins offers several reasons why commentators have a tendency to view Europe as " Allah 's Continent " even though only a small proportion of the residents of Europe are Muslim .
First , scholars tend to count one as " Muslim " on the slightest pretext , because Islamic identity is viewed as a catchall .
In contrast , Christian affiliation is associated more closely with a pro-active identification .
This results in the exaggeration of the number of religious Muslims and an underestimate of Europeans with sentiment or sympathy toward Christianity .
In other words , while secular individuals from a Muslim background can be assumed to have some relationship with the Islamic cultural complex , the same certainly applies to secular individuals from a Christian background !
Jenkins himself regularly repeats the claim that " 8 - 10 % of French are Muslims or of Muslim origin . "
The latter is key , it is well known that French " Muslims " are Second , there is the regional concentration of Muslims .
Rotterdam is half Muslim ( in a nation that is 4 % Muslim ) .
Greater London is 10 % Muslim ( in a nation that is 2.5 % Muslim ) .
Paris is surrounding by suburbs dominated by ethnic North Africans .
There are other dense " pockets " of Muslims throughout Europe , from the industrial heartland of Germany to Malmo to Copenhagen .
Muslims are highly concentrated in particular locales , and this ties in to the third issue , and that is that the European elites also concentrate in the same urban conurbations where Muslims are preponderant .
Brussels , the capital of the EU , is 20 % Muslim !
I am always surprised when I read papers in England complaining that a television show with one non-white character out of 10 does not " reflect Britain . "
But London , and that I believe is the critical variable , because the chattering class naturally conflates its own circumstance with that of the nation .
Fourth , Muslims are a problem .
Issues of class and race are confounded with the role of religion , but Islam qua Islam and its relation to the West are obviously of some importance in the world at this point .
Even if only half of South Asians in Britain are Muslim , they are the half which grips the attention of the media and the public because their impact is not banal or workaday .
Discussions about " Asians " and their problems in Britain elide the reality that the " Asians " are invariably the Muslims .
Fifth , there is politics at work .
Parties on the Far Right in the late 20th century emerged in large part because of the Muslim problem , so it is in their interest to heighten its threat .
Elites on the Left
Against the salience of the Islamic presence on the European continent Jenkins makes a powerful case that Christianity is still a vital , if not preeminent , force on the cultural landscape .
He rebuts the common assertion that Europeans are atheistic & materialistic in the majority with a simple appeal to the
Jenkins also bridges some of the ideas in his previous books by pointing out that a substantial proportion of the immigrants to Europe are Christian .
These communities serve as vital hubs of religious evangelism and Christian belief .
To some extent one might wonder what Third World Christianity has to do with European Christianity , but of course many religious denominations are international .
Just as there is a global Islam , the revivalism of which has world - wide ramifications , so the beliefs of Christians outside of Europe impacts those within Europe .
The Anglican Communion is now demographically a predominantly African Christian community .
Similarly , Roman Catholicism is a religion with a representation on every continent , and its primary regions of growth lay in Africa and to a lesser extent Asia .
For Roman Catholicism this is critical because the sharp decline in the number of seminarians across Europe , excepting Poland , has resulted in the common presence of non-white priests and monastics .
In parts of France immigrants and transplants from Francophone West Africa have been critical in filling the breach left by the lack of replenishment of clerical ranks from the native populace .
In other situations we have peoples who are reaching & pushing back to the " mother church . "
African Lutherans are uncompromising in their criticism of the Lutheran hierarchy of northern Europe , who they accuse of being decadent and ineffectual .
The Mizo peoples of northeast India were originally converted to Christianity by Welsh Protestant nonconformists , but with the decline of fidelity to organized Christianity in Britain they have now sent missionaries back to Wales ( in some ways one might contend this is an expanded recapitulation of the evangelization of Anglo - Saxon Britain from Ireland during the late 6th and early 7th century , as the Irish themselves were converted to Christianity by the Romano - British ) .
The zeal of Korean missionaries is also well known , and their recent problems in the Middle East show just how seriously they take the " Great Commission " ( I do find it rather peculiar when 3/4 of their fellow Koreans remain non-Christian that they venture off to foreign lands like the Irish who ventured into the pagan lands of barbarian Europe ) .
The point here is not that the Scotch will be converted back toward " orthodox " Presbyterianism by the Koreans , it is that the same international religious tendrils which have wafted the embers of Islam across the Mediterranean also have resulted in an indwelling of Christians from across to the world to the continent which has been the faith 's traditional home .
Even if native Europeans were totally lacking in any religious vision or sentiment , Islam is certainly not the only alternative on the scene , for immigrants from other Christian hands have replanted a very vital strand of contemporary Christianity , heavily influenced by the Pentecostal movement , upon European soil .
Emphasizing the native European attachment to Christianity ( revival movements , staunchly Christian nations like Poland ) , as well as immigrant Christianity communities , allows Jenkins to make his case that Islam does not look across a godless continent filled with nihilists , unchallenged and unassailable .
When intellectuals , American and European , speak of the death of Christianity and the post - Christian landscape , they are highlighting two distinct dynamics .
First , the European elite is in many ways post - Christian .
Tony Blair , though an Anglican of some religious convictions , is diffident and tentative in expressing his Christian faith in public .
European statesmen such as Francois Mitterrand have been openly irreligious , while even in Catholic Poland until recently the head of state was personally an unbeliever .
Though American elites are often accused of being " out of touch , " Jenkins argues that European elites exhibit a far greater distance from their " hinterlands " in terms of outlook and world - view ( he suggests that the small size and low number of cultural capitals results in a far greater centralization in terms of elite socialization ) .
Dutch elites in the immigrant filled cities no doubt find it easy to forget that their nation is host to a the reemergence of the ancient classical pattern where Christianity is simply a major cult within a religiously diverse landscape .
The analogy is not totally apt insofar as unlike late antiquity Christians and Christianity still command the heights of the culture , and are a far greater proportion of the population identify as Christians .
Additionally , while late antique Europeans lived in a landscape where pagan religious assumptions were normative and served as the cultural backdrop , today 's post - Christians live in the shadows of their Christian cultural past .
Nevertheless , Europeans have ushered in an age where a wide range of beliefs are acceptable and in currency , just as it was so in late antiquity .
This is a time when the Prince of Wales admits that he would prefer to be a defender of the faith s , not a faith .
European is post - Christian insofar as Christian assumptions are not unchallenged and always at the center of the cultural discourse because the culture is by definition and necessity explicitly Christian .
In decades past the Roman Catholic Church in Italy would not have to reiterate its central role in Italian life , because that would be a given .
But today the presence of a Muslim minority , as well as the rise of secularity , means that Italian Catholicism must pro-actively make the case for its relevance and centrality .
And it is this counter - reaction which Jenkins argues is nearly inevitable .
He offers a historical perspective , in 1798 ancien regime .
Despite the restoration after the fall of Napoleon , the ancien regime did fall and transform into the modern era of nation - states , but Christianity did not die .
It is also important to remember the power of anti-clericalism throughout much of the 19th and early 20th century , and the allure and appeal of radical politics for the European working classes .
In 1881 Italian nationalists attempted to laicism have been at tension for two centuries .
If Europeans tire of the ennui of secular materialism and consumer decadence it seems far more plausible that indigenous religious traditions , prominently local Christianities , will serve the role as the vehicle for a revived organized supernaturalism as opposed to Islam .
There are already signs that in parts of northern Europe where Islam is prominent that locals are exploring their relationship with Christianity anew .
In Scandinavia the Lutheran churches were ( or are ) arms of the state .
In Denmark they term it the Distant Church , and these churches exhibit all the sclerotic tendencies of government bureaucracies .
But just as Pietism arose in response to the cooling of Reformation embers , so a second look at religious traditions visited only in passing , at confirmation and marriage , may be induced by the alternative example of Islamic religious communities which are defined by their relationship to their god .
The pessimism in regards to European Christianity seems to resemble the nostalgia that some intellectuals felt toward classical paganism , which encapsulated a native spirituality more congenial with nationalist sentiment .
European neo-Paganism is in fact a reconstructed tradition which serves as a religious focus for a wholesale re-identification with a national past , mythic or not .
But in the generality it failed as a mass movement , and the reason is simple : paganism died in Europe as an organized and explicit movement , its influence was felt within the cultural substratum in custom and tradition , and re-scaffolding these folkways in a systematic manner into a new religious movement proved impossible because the chain of connection across the generations had been broken .
The same is not true of Christianity , hundreds of millions of Europeans remain Christian believers , the chain of belief has not been broken !
Christianity is not a memory , but a living tradition in some recess , but that recess has been a draw down from a high point after the revivals of the 19th century in the face of 18th century rationalism .
spends a great deal of time on the role and nature of Islam in Europe .
Jenkins offers many ideas and posits future trends which might surprise some .
I wo n't cover these in detail in this post , but rather will follow up later , as I want to keep the focus on Christianity .
But I have to ask , why the relative ignorance of much of the data that Jenkins presents in his book ?
Part of it is surely human psychology .
Readers of this weblog are intelligent , but they can get carried away as much as anyone .
A regular reader of this weblog ( going on 5 years ) conflated the fact that the majority of elementary age children in Rotterdam were Muslim ( the city is , as I said , half Muslim ) with the possibility that the majority of Dutch children were Muslim !
Another reader in a chat was worried about the numbers of Muslims in France , and when I asked him numbers he assumed they were in the 20 - 30 % range .
I respectively offered that the concern is laudable , but one should take 5 seconds and go to Google to look at the range of data ( 15 % is probably the high bound ) .
Another reader responded that in France the problem was that one can't speak out against immigrants and Islam .
I was busy so I did n't respond that the National Front has been a powerful anti-immigrant force ( though ineffectual ) for a generation now , winning 10 - 20 % of the national vote , so such a contention seems highly misleading .
Th reader was likely not stupid , but they were simply blurting out impressionistic thoughts and telegraphing sentiments common in the right - wing press ( i.e. , the inevitable " Death of Europe , " its weakness in the face of Islam and jihadism , etc. ) .
I have been guilty of this myself .
A few years ago I asked on an e-list I was a member of " what northern European nation will become Muslim first ? "
By " first " I meant in this generation , within 10 - 20 yeas .
I was stupid and lazy , and basically engaging in intellectual masturbation instead of courting the data .
I regret the time wasted on this , though it was enjoyable at the time .
In some ways it was a byproduct of the web - masturbatory tendencies of the whole " warblogger " period , where people who knew nothing felt free to say anything about everything .
I was n't a total retard , but my working hypothesis was that a " tipping point " might be reached where Europeans start to convert to Islam .
Now , if I was an absolute ignoramus this sort of model might be plausible , but , I did know some history .
I 'd read a fair amount of Roman , Byzantine and Islamic history , and I had a sense of how " religious change " occurs .
I also knew that the idea that Christianity was n't a lower class religion , that in fact it was a cult of the urban " middle class , " and that it spread to the society at large via elite patronage after the conversion of Constantine and the suppression of pagan cults during the reign of Theodosius .
Finally , I 'd also read a fair amount of sociology of religion and knew of the importance of social networks in the spread of new religions , and the utility bundles which they needed to bring to be successful .
In expressing views which seem laughably simplistic in hindsight I was catering to my masturbatory tendencies and my detestation of Islam , using worst case scenarios to stoke my own sense of Schadenfreude , that the Europeans were getting what was coming to those pussies .
My own animus toward the central tendency of the Muslim religion remains , but I have come to grips to the likelihood that to grapple with reality one must model it properly .
So small details matter , for example , 1/3 of the Muslims within Europe ( excluding Russia ) are n't immigrants or their children .
Rather , they 're part of the old communities of the Balkans .
This is relevant to projecting the impact that non-white immigrants have upon European Islam , and making an identity between racial minorities and Islam .
The cultural influence of Islam and is relationship with race and class are important , plausible high bound estimates of the number of Muslims ( e.g. , assuming no defection and a broad definition of " Muslim " ) allow us to arrive at a ~ 20 % figure for what proportion of the residents of European are of that faith in 2050 .
The Republic of Macedonia is about 33 % Muslim .
These are members of the Albanian ethnic minority , a long established community in the Balkans .
Though today a co-dominion between the Christian Slavs and Muslim Albanians has been achieved , it is only after a civil war in which the Albanians reacted to what they perceived to be overbearing domination and prejudice .
An analogy between Macedonia in the 1990s and Europe in 2050 is not totally apt , insofar as Muslims in Macedonia are established as one ethnic community speaking a common language , sharing a common history , and also deriving some support from neighboring Albania .
But , this might be a situation which allows us to get a sense of the outer boundary of the problems which Islam might cause , in regards to serving as a focus for rebellion of a minority community which demands concessions from the majority .
Nevertheless , it is a far cry from the imposition of Sharia across Europe and domination by mullahs and clerics .
My own concern with this issue as an American has to do with my interest in Europe , the font of Western civilization , and the source of modernity as we understand it .
To Americans " Europe " can mean many things .
To some liberals it is a socialist utopia of secularism .
To many conservatives it is a decadent civilization which we must look to as a warning , a caution about what America might become if it turns its back on its own peculiar cultural traditions .
I think that we Americans have to get over some of these issues , and take and accept Europe on its own terms .
It is a great civilization , of which we Americans are a branch .
It lives to validate its own purpose , and not serve as a prop for our own political quarrels forward our own national interest .
Of course , I believe that acknowledging this reality does serve American national interests , but that is a separate issue altogether .
Do most liberals know that German abortion laws are stricter than those of the United States ?
What about the prevalence of right - wing parties which promote a racialist ideology ?
Do conservatives know that the greatest number of Christians still reside on the European continent ?
If they are Catholic do they give thought to what their pessimism implies for the Bishop of Rome and the great religious centers and sites of their faith ?
Presumably conservatives glory in the canon of Western civilization , but will they sit still in the face of the transformation of the lands from which that canon emerged ?
There is one particular issue which I think puts into stark relief the wrongheaded attitude that Americans have toward Europe : Turkey .
Some conservatives seem to want Turkish admission to the E.U. solely for its proximate impact , as it might please our military ally and somehow aid in the " War on Terror . "
Many liberals see it as part of the multicultural project , a testament to the inclusiveness of modern civilization .
But what about the Europeans ?
After all , they 're the ones who have to live out this experiment !
The European elite is conflicted , and the populace seems dead set against it .
I wo n't elucidate the reasons why Turkish admission is not a " good idea , " but the promotion of this position on the shallow grounds which I have seen on both the American Right and Left highlights the fact that in some ways my nation 's elites look to Europe as if it was just another part of the great world " Out There , " just as blacks and other minorities are charming and " diverse " people in the far off lands away from the Upper East Side or the other redoubts of the American oligarchy .
In the interests of short term tactical position within their own social systems , their own set of hierarchies , they are willing to sell down the river the civilization with which we most definitely have a " special relationship . "
The birth , death , and evolution of cultures are complex topics .
Like a ball of yarn it is almost impossible with untangle all the strands to get a clear picture of the underlying structure .
That being said , the largest threads can be extricated and they serve as a infrastructure which scaffolds the overall structure .
Religion is one of the those " infrastructures " within " culture " in its broadest sense .
Religion is either the justification or the cause of social change , of public debate , the trigger for cataclysmic wars and the mediator of the most banal of social exchanges .
I have written organized religion can be a powerful cultural force to channel social impulses in concurrent directions .
But the basic raw material of magnetism is always there within a molecule , even if they are not aligned together within the ore .
We can not project demographics with a linear model which assumes that fertility rates will stay constant , nor can we assume that the increased " secularism " in the West which began during the 1960s will continue without end .
We can also evaluate hypotheses about mass conversions of Europeans to Islam by using models and analogies to other situations and scenarios where such things did occur .
Masses of Africans converted to Islam and Christianity within this century , while Papuans accept the " white man 's religion " so as to imbibe some of his magical technology .
European warlords took upon the mantle of Christianity to validate their monarchies within the commonwealth of post - Roman states , one God and one King .
And with them came peoples , willingly or not .
It does not take a deep understanding or knowledge of history to dismiss the probability that Europeans will look to the ghettos and housing projects for their spiritual renewal , even assuming that they are the soulless golems which some of their critics accuse them of .
Rather than focusing on the Europeans it is more important to look to European Islam , because it seems highly like that though it will be a junior partner in the dance with post - Christendom , it will definitely have something to say and help shape the course of events .

If you reply to a non-valued comment I 'll just delete your whole comment too , so just be warned .
This post is partly for Google , and partly to encourage people to read this book and draw their own conclusions .
More data is welcome !
Your uninformed opinion , not so much .
Despite the occasional lapses from objectivity , God 's Continent is not a work of rhetoric steeped in anecdote and reliant upon shared norms to render it credible scholarship , its empirical bent is central , the narrative is an extended argument awash in data .
The Next Christendom was a tightly presented brief that the future of the Christian religion lay the Third World , specifically , in Latin America , Africa and Asia .
In it Jenkins ' made the case that the Secularization Hypothesis is false , that it applies primarily to Europe , and that the United States is not an exceptional nation in its religiosity , rather , it is reflective of the worldwide vitality of organized religion .
In large measure The Next Christendom and The New Faces of Christianity were aimed at a secular and progressive Western audience out of touch with the realities of religious expression , but whose own lives might soon be impacted by the changes being wrought by demography .
After all , it is entirely plausible that within the next generation the Pope is more likely to be an African prince of the Church than a conservative German theologian .
This is a very different book with a different audience .
Though Jenkins does spend a fair amount of time engaging secular liberals and their confusions regarding the nature of the religion of the masses of " Europeans , " .
There are numerous quotations of , Mark Steyn and Claire Berlinski , mostly to emphasize the exaggerations and substantive weakness of the claims .
God 's Continent relays clearly the message that the reports of Christendom 's demise are greatly exaggerated .
I wo n't repeat the general arguments made by the likes of Steyn and Berlinski , rather , the first half of Jenkins ' book does the leg work by simply collecting data and doing elementary school level math .
Here are , for example , the number of justChristians vs. Muslims in Europe , inclusive of the Russian Federation :
The author 's point in offering these data is that no one speaks of the evangelical " bounce back " in Europe , even though it is a reality , and numerically more significant than the Muslim presence .
Jenkins does suggest that there are those on the Left who are wedded to the Secularization Hypothesis , and continue to view religion as the opium of the masses which is naturally going to fade away .
And so they dismiss , ignore , or minimize , the vitality of Christian religious movements within the continent .
But it seems his greater irritation is toward American conservatives , who prematurely mourn a religious civilization as if it is dead and buried for the sake of politics and propaganda .
Jenkins offers several reasons why commentators have a tendency to view Europe as " Allah 's Continent " even though only a small proportion of the residents of Europe are Muslim . , because Islamic identity is viewed as a catchall .
In contrast , Christian affiliation is associated more closely with a pro-active identification .
This results in the exaggeration of the number of religious Muslims and an underestimate of Europeans with sentiment or sympathy toward Christianity .
In other words , while secular individuals from a Muslim background can be assumed to have some relationship with the Islamic cultural complex , the same certainly applies to secular individuals from a Christian background !
Jenkins himself regularly repeats the claim that " 8 - 10 % of French are Muslims or . "
The latter is key , it is well known that French " Muslims " are nearly as secular in their habits as French " Catholics , " and a recent survey found that 4 % of respondents identified as Muslim .
This implies that a non-trivial number ( assuming that around 1 out of 10 French citizens is of ethnic identity which is conventionally Muslim ) of French Muslims have even disavowed a nominal association with the religion , which is parallel with a concurrent decline of Catholic identification in the mainstream French population since the 1960s ..
Rotterdam is half Muslim ( in a nation that is 4 % Muslim ) .
Greater London is 10 % Muslim ( in a nation that is 2.5 % Muslim ) .
Paris is surrounding by suburbs dominated by ethnic North Africans .
There are other dense " pockets " of Muslims throughout Europe , from the industrial heartland of Germany to Malmo to Copenhagen .
Muslims are highly concentrated in particular locales , and this ties in to the .
Brussels , the capital of the EU , is 20 % Muslim !
I am always surprised when I read papers in England complaining that a television show with one non-white character out of 10 does not " reflect Britain . "
But a quick survey of the UK Census shows that this is in fact a proportional representation of Britain ( in fact , more than a proportional representation ) .
Nevertheless , it is not a representation of , and that I believe is the critical variable , because the chattering class naturally conflates its own circumstance with that of the nation ..
Issues of class and race are confounded with the role of religion , but IslamIslam and its relation to the West are obviously of some importance in the world at this point .
Even if only half of South Asians in Britain are Muslim , they are the half which grips the attention of the media and the public because their impact is not banal or workaday .
Discussions about " Asians " and their problems in Britain elide the reality that the " Asians " are invariably the Muslims ..
Parties on the Far Right in the late 20th century emerged in large part because of the Muslim problem , so it is in their interest to heighten its threat .
Elites on the Left co-opt Muslims as tools in their own conflicts and culture wars with the Right , high and low .
If Muslims serve as the new revolutionary class then it is in the Left 's interest to promote them and encourage the perception of the power of this constituency , as well as to facilitate its mobilization under the leadership of individuals with whom other segments of society can negotiate .
In the United States there is the peculiar synergy of jingoism and anti-Europeanism that is the hallmark of much of the New Right combined with the neoconservative perception that anti-Semitism is locally on the rise across Europe and that Islam and Islamism are both regional and worldwide problems which the continent is not addressing .
Against the salience of the Islamic presence on the European continent Jenkins makes a powerful case that Christianity is still a vital , if not preeminent , force on the cultural landscape .
He rebuts the common assertion that Europeans are atheistic & materialistic in the majority with a simple appeal to the same survey which I have pointed to .
Europeans have become sharply detached from organized Christianity , but majorities still retain sympathy with supernaturalism broadly construed , and large minorities ( in some nations the majority , e.g. , Greece , Spain , Poland and Ireland ) of religious believers remain with a strong Christian identity .
And then there is the gray land of Europeans who are weakly connected to Christian orthodoxy , but have powerful cultural affinities with their traditional denominational backgrounds ( Edward Said , an atheist from an Anglican religious background , often said that Islam was his civilization .
Similarly , it seems plausible to say that many atheists in the West are of the Christian civilization , whether they like to admit it or not ) .
The large numbers of Europeans who make recourse to rituals such as baptism & confirmation attest to this sentimental attachment .
Additionally , there are some metrics on which Europeans might be said to exhibit greater religiosity than Americans .
For example , the enormous numbers of Catholics who make pilgrimages to holy sites throughout the continent dwarfs any cognate in North America , no doubt in part because of the relative dearth of " sacred spaces " in the United States in comparison to Europe , but also perhaps because that is part of European religious practice which has no equivalent in the United States .
Though it seems fair to say that the average European is less religious than the average American , it is also important to remember that many European cultures are not characterized by the wall of church - state separation which Americans take for granted , and religious assumptions may " guide " the society in a manner surprising to some .
For example , on the issue of abortion Europeans have had a range of responses , with some states as liberal in their laws as the United States ( generally in Scandinavia and Britain ) , but most more conservative ( Germany ) , and some rather restrictive ( Portugal ) .
This diversity is a function of the fact that religious forces , especially the Catholic Church , are political actors who serve to act as breaks upon " progressive " social tendencies .
While in the United States such as activism might be seen as improper , or evidence of the power of the Religious Right , in nations where the church is given a nod in the Constitution ( though not necessarily established ) and explicitly religious parties have long existed such objections are not feasible .
Jenkins also bridges some of the ideas in his previous books by pointing out that a substantial proportion of the immigrants to Europe are Christian .
These communities serve as vital hubs of religious evangelism and Christian belief .
To some extent one might wonder what Third World Christianity has to do with European Christianity , but of course many religious denominations are international .
Just as there is a global Islam , the revivalism of which has world - wide ramifications , so the beliefs of Christians outside of Europe impacts those within Europe .
The Anglican Communion is now demographically a predominantly African Christian community .
Similarly , Roman Catholicism is a religion with a representation on every continent , and its primary regions of growth lay in Africa and to a lesser extent Asia .
For Roman Catholicism this is critical because the sharp decline in the number of seminarians across Europe , excepting Poland , has resulted in the common presence of non-white priests and monastics .
In parts of France immigrants and transplants from Francophone West Africa have been critical in filling the breach left by the lack of replenishment of clerical ranks from the native populace .
In other situations we have peoples who are reaching & pushing back to the " mother church . "
African Lutherans are uncompromising in their criticism of the Lutheran hierarchy of northern Europe , who they accuse of being decadent and ineffectual .
The Mizo peoples of northeast India were originally converted to Christianity by Welsh Protestant nonconformists , but with the decline of fidelity to organized Christianity in Britain they have now sent missionaries back to Wales ( in some ways one might contend this is an expanded recapitulation of the evangelization of Anglo - Saxon Britain from Ireland during the late 6th and early 7th century , as the Irish themselves were converted to Christianity by the Romano - British ) .
The zeal of Korean missionaries is also well known , and their recent problems in the Middle East show just how seriously they take the " Great Commission " ( I do find it rather peculiar when 3/4 of their fellow Koreans remain non-Christian that they venture off to foreign lands like the Irish who ventured into the pagan lands of barbarian Europe ) .
The point here is not that the Scotch will be converted back toward " orthodox " Presbyterianism by the Koreans , it is that the same international religious tendrils which have wafted the embers of Islam across the Mediterranean also have resulted in an indwelling of Christians from across to the world to the continent which has been the faith 's traditional home .
Even if native Europeans were totally lacking in any religious vision or sentiment , Islam is certainly not the only alternative on the scene , for immigrants from other Christian hands have replanted a very vital strand of contemporary Christianity , heavily influenced by the Pentecostal movement , upon European soil .
Emphasizing the native European attachment to Christianity ( revival movements , staunchly Christian nations like Poland ) , as well as immigrant Christianity communities , allows Jenkins to make his case that Islam does not look across a godless continent filled with nihilists , unchallenged and unassailable .
When intellectuals , American and European , speak of the death of Christianity and the post - Christian landscape , they are highlighting two distinct dynamics .
First , the European elite is in many ways post - Christian .
Tony Blair , though an Anglican of some religious convictions , is diffident and tentative in expressing his Christian faith in public .
European statesmen such as Francois Mitterrand have been openly irreligious , while even in Catholic Poland until recently the head of state was personally an unbeliever .
Though American elites are often accused of being " out of touch , " Jenkins argues that European elites exhibit a far greater distance from their " hinterlands " in terms of outlook and world - view ( he suggests that the small size and low number of cultural capitals results in a far greater centralization in terms of elite socialization ) .
Dutch elites in the immigrant filled cities no doubt find it easy to forget that their nation is host to a " Bible Belt " of Calvinist believers .
Nations as disparate as Norway , France and Scotland have regions of elevated Christianity commitment .
But these concentrations of organized Christianity highlight the second trend : .
The analogy is not totally apt insofar as unlike late antiquity Christians and Christianity still command the heights of the culture , and are a far greater proportion of the population identify as Christians .
Additionally , while late antique Europeans lived in a landscape where pagan religious assumptions were normative and served as the cultural backdrop , today 's post - Christians live in the shadows of their Christian cultural past .
Nevertheless , Europeans have ushered in an age where a wide range of beliefs are acceptable and in currency , just as it was so in late antiquity .
This is a time when the Prince of Wales admits that he would prefer to be a defender of the faith , not a faith .
European is post - Christian insofar as Christian assumptions are not unchallenged and always at the center of the cultural discourse because the culture is by definition and necessityChristian .
In decades past the Roman Catholic Church in Italy would not have to reiterate its central role in Italian life , because that would be a given .
But today the presence of a Muslim minority , as well as the rise of secularity , means that Italian Catholicism must pro-actively make the case for its relevance and centrality .
And it is this counter - reaction which Jenkins argues is nearly inevitable .
He offers a historical perspective , in 1798 the Pope was held captive as anti-Christian revolution swept Europe .
Many savants of the age predicted the death of Christianity and the .
Despite the restoration after the fall of Napoleon , thedid fall and transform into the modern era of nation - states , but Christianity did not die .
It is also important to remember the power of anti-clericalism throughout much of the 19th and early 20th century , and the allure and appeal of radical politics for the European working classes .
In 1881 Italian nationalists attempted to seize the body of Pius IX and throw it into the Tiber river .
In France the Catholicism andhave been at tension for two centuries .
If Europeans tire of theof secular materialism and consumer decadence it seems far more plausible that indigenous religious traditions , prominently local Christianities , will serve the role as the vehicle for a revived organized supernaturalism as opposed to Islam .
There are already signs that in parts of northern Europe where Islam is prominent that locals are exploring their relationship with Christianity anew .
In Scandinavia the Lutheran churches were ( or are ) arms of the state .
In Denmark they term it the Distant Church , and these churches exhibit all the sclerotic tendencies of government bureaucracies .
But just as Pietism arose in response to the cooling of Reformation embers , so a second look at religious traditions visited only in passing , at confirmation and marriage , may be induced by the alternative example of Islamic religious communities which are defined by their relationship to their god .
The pessimism in regards to European Christianity seems to resemble the nostalgia that some intellectuals felt toward classical paganism , which encapsulated a native spirituality more congenial with nationalist sentiment .
European neo-Paganism is in fact a reconstructed tradition which serves as a religious focus for a wholesale re-identification with a national past , mythic or not .
But in the generality it failed as a mass movement , and the reason is simple : paganism died in Europe as an organized and explicit movement , its influence was felt within the cultural substratum in custom and tradition , and re-scaffolding these folkways in a systematic manner into a new religious movement proved impossible because the chain of connection across the generations had been broken .
The same is not true of Christianity , !
Christianity is not a memory , but a living tradition in some recess , but that recess has been a draw down from a high point after the revivals of the 19th century in the face of 18th century rationalism .
God 's Continent spends a great deal of time on the role and nature of Islam in Europe .
Jenkins offers many ideas and posits future trends which might surprise some .
I wo n't cover these in detail in this post , but rather will follow up later , as I want to keep the focus on Christianity .
But I have to ask , why the relative ignorance of much of the data that Jenkins presents in his book ?
Part of it is surely human psychology .
Readers of this weblog are intelligent , but they can get carried away as much as anyone .
A regular reader of this weblog ( going on 5 years ) conflated the fact that the majority of elementary age children in Rotterdam were Muslim ( the city is , as I said , half Muslim ) with the possibility that the majority of Dutch children were Muslim !
Another reader in a chat was worried about the numbers of Muslims in France , and when I asked him numbers he assumed they were in the 20 - 30 % range .
I respectively offered that the concern is laudable , but one should take 5 seconds and go to Google to look at the range of data ( 15 % is probably the high bound ) .
Another reader responded that in France the problem was that one can't speak out against immigrants and Islam .
I was busy so I did n't respond that the National Front has been a powerful anti-immigrant force ( though ineffectual ) for a generation now , winning 10 - 20 % of the national vote , so such a contention seems highly misleading .
Th reader was likely not stupid , but they were simply blurting out impressionistic thoughts and telegraphing sentiments common in the right - wing press ( i.e. , the inevitable " Death of Europe , " its weakness in the face of Islam and jihadism , etc. ) .
I have been guilty of this myself .
A few years ago I asked on an e-list I was a member of " what northern European nation will become Muslim first ? "
By " first " I meant in this generation , within 10 - 20 yeas .
I regret the time wasted on this , though it was enjoyable at the time .
In some ways it was a byproduct of the web - masturbatory tendencies of the whole " warblogger " period , where people who knew nothing felt free to say anything about everything .
I was n't a total retard , but my working hypothesis was that a " tipping point " might be reached where Europeans start to convert to Islam .
Now , if I was an absolute ignoramus this sort of model might be plausible , but , I did know some history .
I 'd read a fair amount of Roman , Byzantine and Islamic history , and I had a sense of how " religious change " occurs .
I also knew that the idea that Christianity was n't a lower class religion , that in fact it was a cult of the urban " middle class , " and that it spread to the society at large via elite patronage after the conversion of Constantine and the suppression of pagan cults during the reign of Theodosius .
Finally , I 'd also read a fair amount of sociology of religion and knew of the importance of social networks in the spread of new religions , and the utility bundles which they needed to bring to be successful .
In expressing views which seem laughably simplistic in hindsight I was catering to my masturbatory tendencies and my detestation of Islam , using worst case scenarios to stoke my own sense ofthat the Europeans were getting what was coming to those pussies .
My own animus toward the central tendency of the Muslim religion remains , but I have come to grips to the likelihood that to grapple with reality one must model it properly .
So small details matter , for example , 1/3 of the Muslims within Europe ( excluding Russia ) are n't immigrants or their children .
Rather , they 're part of the old communities of the Balkans .
This is relevant to projecting the impact that non-white immigrants have upon European Islam , and making an identity between racial minorities and Islam .
The cultural influence of Islam and is relationship with race and class are important , plausible high bound estimates of the number of Muslims ( e.g. , assuming no defection and a broad definition of " Muslim " ) allow us to arrive at a ~ 20 % figure for what proportion of the residents of European are of that faith in 2050 .
The Republic of Macedonia is about 33 % Muslim .
These are members of the Albanian ethnic minority , a long established community in the Balkans .
Though today a co-dominion between the Christian Slavs and Muslim Albanians has been achieved , it is only after a civil war in which the Albanians reacted to what they perceived to be overbearing domination and prejudice .
An analogy between Macedonia in the 1990s and Europe in 2050 is not totally apt , insofar as Muslims in Macedonia are established as one ethnic community speaking a common language , sharing a common history , and also deriving some support from neighboring Albania .
But , this might be a situation which allows us to get a sense of the outer boundary of the problems which Islam might cause , in regards to serving as a focus for rebellion of a minority community which demands concessions from the majority .
Nevertheless , it is a far cry from the imposition ofacross Europe and domination by mullahs and clerics .
My own concern with this issue as an American has to do with my interest in Europe , the font of Western civilization , and the source of modernity as we understand it .
To Americans " Europe " can mean many things .
To some liberals it is a socialist utopia of secularism .
To many conservatives it is a decadent civilization which we must look to as a warning , a caution about what America might become if it turns its back on its own peculiar cultural traditions .
I think that we Americans have to get over some of these issues , .
It is a great civilization , .
It lives to validate its own purpose , and not serve as a prop for our own political quarrels forward our own national interest .
Of course , I believe that acknowledging this reality does serve American national interests , but that is a separate issue altogether .
Do most liberals know that German abortion laws are stricter than those of the United States ?
What about the prevalence of right - wing parties which promote a racialist ideology ?
Do conservatives know that the greatest number of Christians still reside on the European continent ?
If they are Catholic do they give thought to what their pessimism implies for the Bishop of Rome and the great religious centers and sites of their faith ?
Presumably conservatives glory in the canon of Western civilization , but will they sit still in the face of the transformation of the lands from which that canon emerged ?
There is one particular issue which I think puts into stark relief the wrongheaded attitude that Americans have toward Europe : Turkey .
Some conservatives seem to want Turkish admission to the E.U. solely for its proximate impact , as it might please our military ally and somehow aid in the " War on Terror . "
Many liberals see it as part of the multicultural project , a testament to the inclusiveness of modern civilization .
But what about the Europeans ?
After all , they 're the ones who have to live out this experiment !
The European elite is conflicted , and the populace seems dead set against it .
I wo n't elucidate the reasons why Turkish admission is not a " good idea , " but the promotion of this position on the shallow grounds which I have seen on both the American Right and Left highlights the fact that in some ways my nation 's elites look to Europe as if it was just another part of the great world " Out There , " just as blacks and other minorities are charming and " diverse " people in the far off lands away from the Upper East Side or the other redoubts of the American oligarchy .
In the interests of short term tactical position within their own social systems , their own set of hierarchies , they are willing to sell down the river the civilization with which we most definitely have a " special relationship .
"
The birth , death , and evolution of cultures are complex topics .
Like a ball of yarn it is almost impossible with untangle all the strands to get a clear picture of the underlying structure .
That being said , the largest threads can be extricated and they serve as a infrastructure which scaffolds the overall structure .
Religion is one of the those " infrastructures " within " culture " in its broadest sense .
Religion is either the justification or the cause of social change , of public debate , the trigger for cataclysmic wars and the mediator of the most banal of social exchanges .
I have written copiously about the different things that religion can mean , that it can be .
Like the felicitous alignment of molecules within ore to generate a magnetic field , religion can be a powerful cultural force to channel social impulses in concurrent directions .
But the basic raw material of magnetism is always there within a molecule , even if they are not aligned together within the ore .
We can not project demographics with a linear model which assumes that fertility rates will stay constant , nor can we assume that the increased " secularism " in the West which began during the 1960s will continue without end .
We can also evaluate hypotheses about mass conversions of Europeans to Islam by using models and analogies to other situations and scenarios where such things did occur .
Masses of Africans converted to Islam and Christianity within this century , while Papuans accept the " white man 's religion " so as to imbibe some of his magical technology .
European warlords took upon the mantle of Christianity to validate their monarchies within the commonwealth of post - Roman states , one God and one King .
And with them came peoples , willingly or not .
It does not take a deep understanding or knowledge of history to dismiss the probability that Europeans will look to the ghettos and housing projects for their spiritual renewal , even assuming that they are the soulless golems which some of their critics accuse them of .
Rather than focusing on the Europeans it is more important to look to European Islam , because it seems highly like that though it will be a junior partner in the dance with post - Christendom , it will definitely have something to say and help shape the course of events .
God 's Continent : Christianity , Islam and Europe 's Religious Crisis is a very good book .
It is dense on data and citation , and the narrative benefits from the author 's multi-faceted understanding of the history and development of religions and religious institutions .
While Jenkins ' previous two books ,
The Next Christendom The New Faces of Christianity , painted a vibrant & fresh portrait of Christianity across the world , from Africa to Latin America and Asia , God 's Continent is geographically more narrow - focused , though thematically broader .
Unlike many academics Jenkins has the ability to be sympathetic toward his subjects without seeming patronizing or turning into an advocate ( though on occasion he does verge upon the latter ) .
Importantly , as an Episcopalian he does not necessarily view all religions as fundamentally outmoded and primitive , allowing contempt to cloud the narrative .
Though his sympathies and potential biases are pretty obvious , the data are so abundant that it takes little effort to arrive at conclusions at variance with the author's .

Hagel :
There are ways to deal with ' a president who says ' I do n't care ' Ron Brynaert
Published : Sunday March 25 , 2007 Print This Email This Senator Chuck Hagel ( R- NE ) , a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who is considering running for president in 2008 , stopped just short of threatening impeachment against President George Bush on ABC's This Week with George Stephanopoulos on Sunday morning .
Hagel has been a vocal critic of the war in Iraq and recently referenced impeachment in an interview published in April 's edition of Esquire Magazine , telling Charles P. Pierce , " The president says , ' I do n't care . '
He 's not accountable anymore .
He 's not accountable anymore , which is n't totally true .
You can impeach him , and before this is over , you might see calls for his impeachment .
I do n't know .
It depends how this goes . "
Hagel disagrees that " right now we 're actually seeing the increase in forces actually start to deliver some results in Baghdad , " as the White House has argued .
" No , I do n't see that , " Hagel told Stephanopoulos .
" In fact , there are more incidents , not less .
Sure , in parts of Baghdad , in overall Baghdad , over the last two or three weeks , we have seen some fewer , but not around the country .
Look at what happened two days ago , one of the two vice presidents of Iraq was attacked there at his own compound and is lying mortally wounded in a hospital . "
Hagel added , " No , it is n't getting any less dangerous , and the fact is that was predictable , the more American troops you flood into a zone , sure , you 're going to see some immediate effect of that but that has nothing to do with the long - term or lasting effect .
This solution in Iraq is not going to come by continuing to put more and more Americans in there because we 're bogging ourselves down .
We are further eroding our credibility and stature in the Middle East .
It 's going to make it more and more difficult for us to get out because we are going to have to get out . "
Hagel mentioned that the Inspector General testified before Congress this week , and " reminded all of us that we have now spent almost a half a trillion dollars in Iraq , " and " have put at least 40 billion in economic development there , [ w ] hich we do n't know what we got out of it . "
" There 's still no oil law , " Hagel added .
" Billions of dollars have been ripped off , unaccounted for , and one more point on this -- over $ 22 billion of Iraqi money still sits in the accounts of the Iraqi government that they have n't spent .
So something has to give here , George . "
Hagel then expanded upon his " impeachment " comments in the Esquire interview .
" Well , any president who says ' I do n't care ' or ' I will not respond to what the people of this country are saying about Iraq or anything else ' or ' I do n't care what the Congress does , I am going to proceed , ' if a president really believes that , then there are , what I was pointing out , there are ways to deal with that , " Hagel said .
Hagel added , " This is not a monarchy . "
" And you think that would be appropriate in this case ? " Stephanopoulos asked .
Hagel hedged a little bit , " I did n't say that .
I did n't call for it .
I did n't predict it .
What I was saying , I was laying out options here .
No president can dictate to this country , nor should he .
This is a constitutional form of government .
We have three equal branches of government .
No president is bigger than the other two .
There are three co-equal branches of government .
Article 1 of the Constitution is not the presidency .
It 's the Congress . "
But the Republican senator again referred to impeachment when he said that " there are ways to deal with this . "
" So what I was pointing out , George , is that there are ways to deal with this and I would hope the president understands that , " Hagel said .
" I mean , his comments this weekend , yesterday in his radio address were astounding to me .
Saying to the Congress in effect , you do n't belong in this .
I 'm in charge of Iraq . "
Transcript of interview : # MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Good morning , everyone .
The White House and congressional Democrats squared off again this week with showdowns looming on Iraq war funding and the firing of those eight U.S. attorneys .
And our headliner this morning is a man who often finds himself at odds with both sides , Senator Chuck Hagel .
Welcome back , senator .
SEN .
HAGEL : George .
MR . STEPHANOPOULOS : I want to get to your presidential plans later in the interview but let 's begin with Attorney General Gonzales and these documents that came out late Friday night which showed that he did attend at least one meeting where this U.S. attorney situation was discussed , but when the controversy bubbled up earlier this month he denied attending any meetings .
Take a look at this .
ATTORNEY GENERAL ALBERTO GONZALES : ( From videotape . )
Like every CEO , I am ultimately accountable and responsible for what happens within the Department .
But that is , in essence , what I knew about the process , was not involved in seeing any memos , was not involved in any discussions about what was going on .
I never saw documents .
We never had a discussion about where things stood .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Does the Attorney General have a credibility problem ?
SEN .
HAGEL : He does have a credibility problem .
George , as you know because you 've been in administrations , as well as your service over on Capitol Hill , we govern with one currency and that 's trust .
And that trust is all important and when you lose or debase that currency , then you can't govern .
And I think he 's going to have some difficulties .
They 've changed their stories .
They 've moved back and forth , and I have always believed and I 've been in and out of this town a little bit , the only way to govern is be straightforward .
Be honest .
The stories will always come out .
There are no secrets and it's not just because there 's a bob Woodward in this town .
Just be straight out , transparent and if you 've got a problem , fix it but get out of it .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS : How do you explain his problems here ?
What do you think happened here ?
SEN .
HAGEL : I do n't know if he got bad advice or if he was not involved in the day - to - day management .
I do n't know what the problem is but he 's got a problem .
You cannot have the nation 's chief law enforcement officer with a cloud hanging over his credibility , and then you couple that with other recent events over there with the national security letter debacle with the FBI , the abuses of the Patriot Act , all within the purview of the Attorney General 's scope of management , it 's week after week there 's another problem .
This needs to be addressed and I think the president makes a big mistake if he tries to make this a constitutional issue and make it a separation of powers issue .
Fix the problem .
Ronald Reagan did it .
Bill Clinton did it .
Other presidents have done it .
Invoke executive privilege then say it's in the interest of the country to get to the bottom of this and fix it .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Those are two separate issues .
I want to get to both .
On the first , on the Attorney General himself , you said he has a deep credibility problem .
You 've pointed out all the other problems that have come up in the Justice Department over the last couple of years .
Do you think he can still serve effectively as Attorney General ?
SEN .
HAGEL : Well , I do not , and I think the president is going to have to make a tough choice here .
The president has a number of other big issues that he is going to be dealing with and dealing with right now .
We 've got the Iraq war issue that is continuing to deepen and worsen .
We will be focused in the Senate this week on that issue .
The House just passed a tough bill yesterday or Friday on the supplemental spending .
We 've got another dozen big issues out there that the president must govern on .
He must focus on , and he must lead the country and the world on .
And he surely cannot be burdened by his chief law enforcement officer under a cloud of credibility .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
You also mentioned the showdown over executive privilege .
The White House said this week that they 're willing to send up White House officials like Karl Rove to discuss this , but it has to be in private .
It ca n't be under oath .
One conversation only and no transcript .
What do you think of those conditions ?
SEN .
HAGEL : Well , I do n't think those are conditions .
My goodness , is n't the objective here -- is to get to the bottom of the issue ?
Is n't the objective to find out the truth ?
Is n't the objective to be transparent and let the American people know what happened ?
What went wrong .
If there is something that needs to be fixed , then let 's find out what it is and let 's fix it .
The president has talked about those kind of things over the years , but to say you can't have a transcript , the American people should not understand or know what 's going on , it not be done under oath , I just do n't understand .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
So you just think he should invoke the privilege but then voluntarily send the officials up to testify ?
SEN .
HAGEL : That 's the way I would do it and I think we have a very clear past record of other presidents taking that same course of action .
President Reagan did that on Iran - Contra .
" The Washington Post " has a story today which highlights your picture -- MR.
STEPHANOPOULOS :
Thanks for reminding me , Senator ! ( Laughs ) SEN .
HAGEL : And we are very appreciative of your selfless public service to our country , George .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Thank you .
SEN .
HAGEL : But there are many examples of how presidents in the past have handled this and handled things like this very responsibly .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Let 's talk about Iraq .
You mentioned the House Democrats passed their bill .
Their version of the Iraq war funding bill this week which imposed benchmarks on the Iraqi government but also set a deadline for the removal of all U.S. combat forces .
Can you sign on to that ?
SEN .
HAGEL : Well , I believe this , and I 've said this from the beginning .
There will not be a military solution to Iraq .
The solution to Iraq will come as a result of a political accommodation by the people in Iraq , the Iraqi people , which will result in a political resolution .
I have said also that I 'm absolutely opposed to a further American military escalation in Iraq .
That 's what 's going on here .
And it 's one of these , oh , by the way -- It 's one of these gradual incremental - type oh , by the ways .
We first heard the president 's announcement on this a few weeks ago , 21,500 troops .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
The question is how do you stop it ?
SEN .
HAGEL : Well , I think the Congress is going to play a role now like we have not played before .
You 've already seen the House play that role .
We will debate it this week in the Senate .
Senator Jim Webb and I are going to introduce some legislation that will , in fact , have the force of law in the future involvement of our military , in our country and what conditions that future will be .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS : So combining legislation , what kind of conditions are you going to try to impose ?
SEN .
HAGEL : It will be binding legislation , and it will be focused on deployment , redeployment , training , equipment .
What we 're doing to our force structure in this country is disastrous .
We essentially are ruining our National Guard .
We are destroying our Army .
We 're destroying our Marine Corps .
We can't sustain this kind of not only deployment , but training tempo , and the consequences of that , you 're seeing at Walter Reed Hospital , for example and the consequences of that , for example , dumbing down your United States Army .
We are now in a situation , we 're waiving criminal records , drug abuse records to entice people to join the Army .
You are ruining a 30 - year effort to produce , which we have , the best Army in the world .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS : I 'm unclear on what exactly you 're trying to do .
Are you going to be setting an end date for U.S. involvement ?
I do n't want to get too far ahead of Senator Webb on this .
We have not announced what exactly those amendments will say .
We will do that early next week , either tomorrow or Tuesday , but I would say that it does affect the outcome , the conditions of America 's military involvement in Iraq .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Well , then , just to be clear , though , you cannot accept what the House passed , would you vote to strip those conditions from the legislation ?
SEN .
HAGEL : I would want to see what , in the end , I have to vote on .
Let me put it this way , I will not accept the status quo .
I will not continue to support with my vote the status quo .
I am opposed to the president 's current policy .
I am opposed to the president 's further escalation of America 's military involvement .
We are undermining our interest in the Middle East .
We are undermining our military .
We 're undermining the confidence of people around the world in what we 're doing .
We have , clearly , a situation where the president has lost the confidence of the American people in his war effort .
It is now time , going into the fifth year of that effort , for the Congress to step forward and be part of setting some boundaries and some conditions as far as -- MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS : But the White House has argued , Stephen Hadley was here last week , that right now we 're actually seeing the increase in forces actually start to deliver some results in Baghdad .
Do n't you see that at all ?
SEN .
HAGEL : No , I do n't see that .
In fact , there are more incidents , not less .
Sure , in parts of Baghdad , in overall Baghdad , over the last two or three weeks , we have seen some fewer , but not around the country .
Look at what happened two days ago , one of the two vice presidents of Iraq was attacked there at his own compound and is lying mortally wounded in a hospital .
No , it is n't getting any less dangerous , and the fact is that was predictable , the more American troops you flood into a zone , sure , you 're going to see some immediate effect of that but that has nothing to do with the long - term or lasting effect .
This solution in Iraq is not going to come by continuing to put more and more Americans in there because we 're bogging ourselves down .
We are further eroding our credibility and stature in the Middle East .
It 's going to make it more and more difficult for us to get out because we are going to have to get out .
You know , we had the Inspector General testifying , our Inspector General , Mr. Bowen , he was testifying before the Congress this week .
I met with him alone for an hour and a half .
He reminded all of us that we have now spent almost a half a trillion dollars in Iraq .
We have put at least 40 billion in economic development there .
Which we do n't know what we got out of it .
There 's still no oil law .
Billions of dollars have been ripped off , unaccounted for , and one more point on this -- over $ 22 billion of Iraqi money still sits in the accounts of the Iraqi government that they have n't spent .
So something has to give here , George .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
It is clear to me that you are angry about this and you also gave an interview to " Esquire " magazine this month , the April edition of " Esquire " magazine where you were quoted as saying , " the president says ' I do n't care ' , he 's not accountable anymore , he 's not accountable anymore , which is n't totally true .
You can impeach him .
And before this is over , you might see calls for his impeachment . "
SEN .
HAGEL : Well , any president who says " I do n't care " or " I will not respond to what the people of this country are saying about Iraq or anything else " or " I do n't care what the Congress does , I am going to proceed , " if a president really believes that , then there are , what I was pointing out , there are ways to deal with that .
This is not a monarchy .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
And you think that would be appropriate in this case ?
SEN .
HAGEL : I did n't say that .
I did n't call for it .
I did n't predict it .
What I was saying , I was laying out options here .
No president can dictate to this country , nor should he .
This is a constitutional form of government .
We have three equal branches of government .
No president is bigger than the other two .
There are three co-equal branches of government .
Article 1 of the Constitution is not the presidency .
It 's the Congress .
So what I was pointing out , George , is that there are ways to deal with this and I would hope the president understands that .
I mean , his comments this weekend , yesterday in his radio address were astounding to me .
Saying to the Congress in effect , you do n't belong in this .
I 'm in charge of Iraq .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS : You 're talking about the U.S. attorney controversy ?
SEN .
HAGEL : No , I 'm talking about what he was referring to specifically in his radio address about what the House of Representatives did on Iraq .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Friday on Iraq , okay .
SEN .
HAGEL : And essentially dismissing them .
Now , he can disagree , of course .
I understand that .
That 's his responsibility .
But to dismiss them , the Congress by saying , " you do n't have a role in this , you 're irrelevant to this , " he 's getting some bad advice and I would suggest they all go back and reread the Constitution .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Let me talk to you about your own plans for the White House .
You gave this press conference in Nebraska a couple weeks ago that you had the whole press corps come in , national press corps , and then essentially had nothing to announce and a lot of people were scratching his heads .
I was , at the end of it , including the late night comics .
Look what Jay Leno said .
TONIGHT SHOW HOST JAY LENO : ( From videotape . )
Nebraska senator Chuck Hagel , he 's a Republican , called a press conference to announce he 'll be making a decision about running for president sometime later in the year .
So he called a press conference to say maybe later in the year he 's going to say something important .
This is the kind of bold , decisive leadership this country needs .
( Laughter . ) MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
What was that about ?
SEN .
HAGEL : Well , first of all , I did n't ask all the media to come .
In fact , I do n't think there was one network correspondent there except one from a cable news show .
I told the people of Nebraska that I would make an announcement on a decision sometime early this year .
I owed that to them .
I thought about just putting out a press release , George , and saying this is what I 'm going to do .
Then I thought I do n't think that 's right .
People deserve to understand why and I think the way to do that is just come before them .
I went to Nebraska .
We did n't make a big deal about it .
We did n't ask people to come .
We put out a one - paragraph statement .
I did n't ask the party to come .
My family was n't there .
It was the press who built this up .
I did n't build it up .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
So what factors are in play now in your decision ?
SEN .
HAGEL : Same factors that have always been .
Number one , I said I was n't ready to make a decision about my political future .
I do n't work off of someone else 's time line , George .
I 've never done that .
I do n't work off someone else 's expectations .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
So you do n't think it 's too late to get in now ?
A lot of people looked at it and said , " He 's not running . "
SEN .
HAGEL : Well , I 'll make that decision .
I can't worry about things I can't control .
I do have a job now and that 's an important job .
I think if this town , all of us in elective office , paid a little more attention to focusing on the responsibilities we have now to govern and try to focus on , as I have and I 'm going to continue to do , Social Security reform , entitlement reform , immigration reform , being just three bills that I 've been leaders on , I 'm going to come back and introduce new legislation on that -- those are jobs that need to be attended to and issues right now .
Now , I will make a decision when I think I 'm ready and my family is ready .
I can't control what the Nebraska people or the people of this country will do or will not do .
I learned a long time ago to put my energies into things , George , that I can control .
So I 'm sorry if I did n't fulfill expectations of some people , but I never misled anybody on this .
MR .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
Well , come back when you 're ready to announce .
Senator Hagel , thanks very much .
SEN .
HAGEL : Thanks , George . #
LAST YEAR , the National Journal asked a group of Republican senators and House members : “ Do you think it ’s been proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Earth is warming because of man-made problems ? ”
Of the respondents , 23 % said yes , 77 % said no .
In the year since that poll , of course , global warming has seized a massive amount of public attention .
The U.N. 's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a study , with input from 2,000 scientists worldwide , finding that the certainty on man-made global warming had risen to 90 % .
So , the magazine asked the question again last month .
The results ?
Only 13 % of Republicans agreed that global warming has been proved .
As the evidence for global warming gets stronger , Republicans are actually getting more skeptical .
Al Gore ’s recent congressional testimony on the subject , and the chilly reception he received from GOP members , suggest the discouraging conclusion that skepticism on global warming is hardening into party dogma .
Like the notion that tax cuts are always good or that President Bush is a brave war leader , it ’s something you almost have to believe if you ’re an elected Republican .
How did it get this way ?
The easy answer is that Republicans are just tools of the energy industry .
It ’s certainly true that many of them are .
Leading global warming skeptic Rep. Joe L. Barton ( R - Texas ) , for instance , was the subject of a fascinating story in the Wall Street Journal a couple of years ago .
The bottom line is that his relationship to the energy industry is as puppet relates to hand .
But the financial relationship does n’t quite explain the entirety of GOP skepticism on global warming .
For one thing , the energy industry has dramatically softened its opposition to global warming over the last year , even as Republicans have stiffened theirs .

The truth is more complicated -- and more depressing : A small number of hard - core ideologues ( some , but not all , industry shills ) have led the thinking for the whole conservative movement .
Your typical conservative has little interest in the issue .
Of course , neither does the average nonconservative .
But we nonconservatives tend to defer to mainstream scientific wisdom .
Conservatives defer to a tiny handful of renegade scientists who reject the overwhelming professional consensus .
National Review magazine , with its popular website , is a perfect example .
It has a blog dedicated to casting doubt on global warming , or solutions to global warming , or anybody who advocates a solution .
Its title is “ Planet Gore . ”
The psychology at work here is pretty clear :
Your average conservative may not know anything about climate science , but conservatives do know they hate Al Gore .
So , hold up Gore as a hate figure and conservatives will let that dictate their thinking on the issue .
Meanwhile , Republicans who do believe in global warming get shunted aside .
Nicole Gaudiano of Gannett News Service recently reported that Rep. Wayne Gilchrest asked to be on the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming .
House Republican leader John Boehner of Ohio refused to allow it unless Gilchrest would say that humans have not contributed to global warming .
The Maryland Republican refused and was denied a seat .
Advertisement
Reps . Roscoe Bartlett ( R - Md. ) and Vernon Ehlers ( R - Mich . ) , both research scientists , also were denied seats on the committee .
Normally , relevant expertise would be considered an advantage .
In this case , it was a disqualification ; if the GOP allowed Republican researchers who accept the scientific consensus to sit on a global warming panel , it would kill the party ’s strategy of making global warming seem to be the pet obsession of Democrats and Hollywood lefties .
The phenomenon here is that a tiny number of influential conservative figures set the party line ; dissenters are marginalized , and the rank and file go along with it .
No doubt something like this happens on the Democratic side pretty often too .
It ’s just rare to find the phenomenon occurring in such a blatant way .
You can tell that some conservatives who want to fight global warming understand how the psychology works and are trying to turn it in their favor .
Their response is to emphasize nuclear power as an integral element of the solution .
Sen .
John McCain , who supports action on global warming , did this in a recent National Review interview .
The technique seems to be surprisingly effective .
When framed as a case for more nuclear plants , conservatives seem to let down their guard .
In reality , nuclear plants may be a small part of the answer , but you could n’t build enough to make a major dent .
But the psychology is perfect .
Conservatives know that lefties hate nuclear power .
So , yeah , Rush Limbaugh listeners , let ’s fight global warming and stick it to those hippies !
Cult members of Monafiqeen - e - Khalq .
According to the Pentagon and the CIA , these women will help bring down the mullahocracy in Iran .
Of course , the truth of the matter is quite different , as these poor deluded women will likely become yet another group of neocon victims along the road to a “ clash of civilizations . ”
William Lowther and Colin Freeman , writing for the Sunday Telegraph , tell us what we knew more than a year ago : the United States is fomenting terrorism in Iran .
“ America is secretly funding militant ethnic separatist groups in Iran in an attempt to pile pressure on the Islamic regime to give up its nuclear program , ” reports the newspaper .
“ In a move that reflects Washington ’s growing concern with the failure of diplomatic initiatives , CIA officials are understood to be helping opposition militias among the numerous ethnic minority groups clustered in Iran ’s border regions . ”
As should be expected , the Sunday Telegraph , as a neocon newspaper formerly associated with Baron Black of Crossharbour , aka Conrad Black , has sugar - coated this terrorism against the Iranian people , dismissing it as “ pressure ” against the “ Islamic regime ” the neocons accuse of working feverishly on nuclear weapons , an allegation completely devoid of any evidence , that is beyond the Brothers Grimm fairy tales invented by the neocons .
Moreover , the “ failure of diplomatic initiatives ” is entirely the fault of the United States , as Iran has , on several occasions , attempted diplomatic overtures , only to be rebuffed .
In other words , no matter what Iran does it will be shocked and awed , that is after MEK and other terrorist groups blow up a few more buses .
“ The operations are controversial because they involve dealing with movements that resort to terrorist methods in pursuit of their grievances against the Iranian regime , ” the newspaper continues .
Controversial ?
In fact , they are illegal under international law .
No doubt Iran would be completely justified in attacking New York , Los Angeles , Chicago , Miami , etc. , in response to these violations of its national sovereignty .
Nothing “ impair[s ] the inherent right of individual or collective self - defense if an armed attack occurs , ” stipulates Article 51 , Chapter VII of the United Nations charter in respect to “ action with respect to threats to the peace , breaches of the peace , and acts of aggression , ” not that we can expect the United Nations to support Iran ’s self - defense .
“ In the past year there has been a wave of unrest in ethnic minority border areas of Iran , with bombing and assassination campaigns against soldiers and government officials . ”
Imagine the outrage if Iran flamed the fans of “ unrest ” in the “ ethnic minority border areas ” of the United States .
Every yahoo in the country would be calling for the U.S. to turn Iran into a glass parking lot .
Imagine the response if Iranian terrorists engaged in “ bombing and assassination campaigns against soldiers and government officials ” here in the United States .
“ Funding for [ the ] separatist causes [ of Kurds , Ahwazi Arabs , Baluchis , and Azeris ] comes directly from the CIA ’s classified budget but is now ‘ no great secret ’ , according to one former high - ranking CIA official in Washington who spoke anonymously to The Sunday Telegraph . ”
No kidding .
For those of us doing our homework , such behavior is a no- brainer , as the CIA has engaged in such for decades in far - flung places around the world , including Guatemala , Indonesia , Chile , Greece , Zaire , Nicaragua , Afghanistan , Angola , El Salvador , Haiti , Panama , Yugoslavia , on and on and on , ad infinitum , resulting literally in the murder of more than a million people .
Not only did the CIA and the Pentagon hatch Operation Gladio , Operation CHAOS , MK - ULTRA , engage in drug trafficking , money laundering , and create the “ the mighty Wurlitzer ” propaganda machine that long ago penetrated the very core of the corporate media , they staffed their various “ intelligence ” ( covert murder and mayhem ) organizations with former Nazis , employing lovelies such as General Reinhard Gehlen , Klaus Barbie ( ” the Butcher of Lyon ” ) , Otto von Bolschwing ( Eichmann collaborator ) and SS Colonel Otto Skorzeny , a personal friend of Hitler .
Naturally , we should n’t expect the Sunday Telegraph to provide such a frame of reference .
Lowther and Freeman continue :
“ Although Washington officially denies involvement in such activity , Teheran has long claimed to detect the hand of both America and Britain in attacks by guerrilla groups on its internal security forces .
Last Monday , Iran publicly hanged a man , Nasrollah Shanbe Zehi , for his involvement in a bomb attack that killed 11 Revolutionary Guards in the city of Zahedan in Sistan - Baluchistan .
An unnamed local official told the semi-official Fars news agency that weapons used in the attack were British and US - made . ”
Washington may “ officially ” deny such involvement , but the neocons , led by the universal fascist Michael Ledeen — ” a fixture of Washington ’s neo-conservative community for more than 20 years , ” according to journalist Jim Lobe — have advocated such “ operations , ” i.e. , common terrorism , for quite some time now .
Ledeen , “ who divides his time among National Review Online , JINSA , and the American Enterprise Institute ( AEI ) , ” Scott Thompson wrote back in 2003 , “ is stirring up [ U.S. private foundations and think - tank ] networks in Congress and the press , and lining up tainted intelligence to justify war on Iran … .
His efforts should be understood as reflecting the immediate intentions of the Administration neo-conservatives . ”
Ledeen and company have been putting this operation in place for some time .
In 2001 , Ledeen founded the Coalition for Democracy in Iran ( CDI ) , with a call for regime change in that country .
One of his partners in founding the coalition was Dr. Rob Sobhani , a professor at Georgetown University and president of Caspian Energy Consulting .
Support for the CDI also comes from the Center for Security Policy ’s Frank Gaffney , former Rep. Jack Kemp , Joshua Muravchik of AEI , and former CIA director James Woolsey , who sits on the Defense Policy Board .
Woolsey has also worked for the Doug Feith / Abram Shulsky “ Office of Special Plans ” in the Pentagon , which cooked the intelligence to push through the Iraq War .
One of CDI ’s policies , as spelled out in the June 15 Washington Post , is to support Brownback ’s call for an Iran Liberation Act , similar to the 1997 one for Iraq .
Thus it should not be surprising Plan Iran Attack is unfolding in similar fashion to Plan Iraq Attack , the latter moving along quite nicely for the neocons , who are dedicated to destroying Arab and Islamic culture and society , a strategy for human misery long ago sketched out by Zionist Israelis , indeed before the establishment of a “ Jewish state ” on confiscated land , depopulated through terrorist methods .
According to the Sunday Telegraph , the current CIA — and we must assume , Pentagon covert ops — ” policy is fraught with risk , ” as many “ of the groups share little common cause with Washington other than their opposition to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , whose regime they accuse of stepping up repression of minority rights and culture . ”
The Baluchistan - based Brigade of God group , which last year kidnapped and killed eight Iranian soldiers , is a volatile Sunni organization that many fear could easily turn against Washington after taking its money .
A row has also broken out in Washington over whether to “ unleash ” the military wing of the Mujahedeen-e Khalq ( MEK ) , an Iraq - based Iranian opposition group with a long and bloody history of armed opposition to the Iranian regime .
The group is currently listed by the US state department as terrorist organization , but [ John Pike , head of the “ influential ” Global Security think tank in Washington ] said : “ A faction in the Defense Department wants to unleash them .
They could never overthrow the current Iranian regime but they might cause a lot of damage . ”
Not a big deal , of course , as the CIA organized and unleashed the Mujahideen in Afghanistan against the Soviet Union , its “ Arab ” faction , almost exclusively Sunni of the reactionary Wahhabi sort , soon enough to be reformulated into the eminently useful “ al - Qaeda , ” taking the “ jihad ” into Bosnia , Kosovo , Macedonia , and Chechnya .
Likewise rag - tag terrorist gangs , as equally demented , as MEK certainly is with its Marxist flavor of Islam ( never mind the big time discrepancies ) , are now being unleashed against Iran , not for the purpose of liberating the Iranian people from the admittedly medieval and undemocratic mullahocracy , but rather with the idea of causing “ a lot of damage ” in the lead - up to a full - scale shock and awe attack .

Over the weekend I attended my brother - in - law ’s high school graduation .
My wife and I were nervous when her brother excitedly told us that the commencement speaker was someone who had spoken to the class before , and was " a pilot who had been in Vietnam and told us he ’d done the things that the US government had denied it was doing . "
Apprehensive as I was , the speech did n’t turn out as my - country - right - or - wrong as I had feared .
He mostly stuck to the clichéd yet important truisms that young people need to hear .
( Of course they wo n’t believe you when you tell them , but after they make the mistakes of chasing popularity , adopting other people ’s moral codes , etc. etc. , maybe your words will help them understand exactly what went wrong .
Then they can continue the cycle by warning the next crop of bored teenagers . )
However , the one thing that really bothered me about this guy ’s talk was that he actually told them : " Now kids , the most important thing you can do to turn around this great nation of ours is to vote .
Does anyone here know what percentage of the eligible voters participated in the last presidential election ? "
Now this is a very typical view , especially coming on Memorial Day weekend .
Yet I think it is just plain dumb .
Bear with me as I try to explain my ( literally ! ) politically incorrect views on voting .
The people who lament the state of our nation obviously do n’t like the politicians we ’ve been electing , right ?
So at first blush , should n’t they be blaming the people who voted for them ?
Let ’s go back to the speaker at my brother - in - law ’s graduation .
He did n’t come right out and say it , but I ’d be willing to bet my pocket Constitution that this guy was a strong supporter of George Bush over John Kerry and Al Gore .
So what would have happened if more people had turned out to the polls ?
Either the same outcome would ’ve occurred , or we ’d have John Kerry leading us in the fight against Islamic terrorism .
So why was this guy complaining ?
Really folks , let ’s think this through .
The people who complain about the lack of voting seem to imply that if only people were more interested , then there would be great candidates from which to choose .
No , actually the causality is the other way around .
In our great system — at least for the last several decades — the voters have really been presented with only two possibilities .
One candidate pledges to moderately invade economic liberties and strongly invade civil ones , while the other candidate pledges the reverse .
The voters slowly come to see that there really is n’t a dime ’s worth of difference between the parties .
( Did you know that the " conservative " George W. Bush has increased federal spending at the highest rate since Lyndon Johnson , and that even if you exclude defense spending , he ’s increased spending more than the " liberal " Clinton ?
What about the " right winger " Richard Nixon , who imposed wage and price controls and took the US off the gold standard ?
And how about those compassionate Democrats who care about children , like Janet Reno ? )
Now in this environment , what the heck is the concerned citizen supposed to do ?
Keep mindlessly pulling the lever for the politician who will merely slow ( not reverse ) the erosion of the Constitution ?
No , I submit that , in his or her capacity as a voter in the general election , the best thing the voter can do ( if the choices really are abysmal ) is either vote for a third party candidate or abstain altogether .
The worst thing in the world to do would be to cast a vote for an admittedly awful candidate and thus grant legitimacy to his rule .
Just to distinguish my cynical views on government in general , from my specific objections to the " You ’re right to vote " crowd :
It would have made sense if the commencement speaker had advised the kids to go into politics , or to become very active in the primaries of the party that best represented the particular student ’s views .
I personally would ’ve disagreed with that advice , since I agree with H.L. Mencken that elections are just advance auctions on stolen goods .
But at least that advice would ’ve made sense .
In contrast , if you are as disgusted as most people are with the clowns running for office , then think before you repeat the mantra that it ’s everyone ’s duty to go vote .
Maybe if the clowns starting getting only 10 or 15 percent turnout , more responsible people would go back into politics .
And if you wanted to be really radical , after you tell kids to follow their hearts , be individuals , disagree with the crowd , and so forth , maybe you could point out that elections are giant popularity contests .
That at least might get their attention , since they ’ve probably never heard that before .
I grant you , you wo n’t change anything right away .
But perhaps in twenty years when they ’re explaining to their own kids about the days when you could cross state lines without showing the national ID card , they might vaguely remember that cranky old man who talked to their high school class , making some anal distinction between democracy versus a republic .

6 Foreign Expressions You Should Know By Daniel Scocco
Whether you like it or not , foreign expressions represent an integral part of the English language ( and of many other languages , too ) .
Knowing the meaning and usage of the most used ones is very important .
First of all because it will enable you to understand pieces of text that include them .
Secondly , because you might also need to use those expressions on particular situations ( avoid using them just to sound smart though ) .
Below you will find 6 foreign expressions commonly used in English , enjoy !
1. De Facto
De facto is a Latin expression that means “ actual ” ( if used as an adjective ) or “ in practice ” ( if used as an adverb ) .
In legal terms , de facto is commonly used in contrast to de jure , which means “ by law . ”
Something , therefore , can emerge either de facto ( by practice ) or de jure ( by law ) .
And what of the plastic red bench , which has served as his de facto home for the last 15 years and must by now be a collector ’s item ?
( NY Times )
2. Vis-à-Vis
The literal meaning of this French expression is “ face to face ” ( used as an adverb ) .
It is used more widely as a preposition though , meaning “ compared with ” or “ in relation to . ”
It ’s going to be a huge catalyst in moving the whole process forward and it really strengthens the U.S. position vis-a - vis our trading partners ( Yahoo ! News )
3. Status quo
This famous Latin expression means “ the current or existing state of affairs . ”
If something changes the status quo , it is changing the way things presently are .
Bush believes that the status quo — the presence in a sovereign country of a militant group with missiles capable of hitting a U.S. ally — is unacceptable .
( Washington Post )
4. Cul-de-sac
This expression was originated in England by French - speaking aristocrats .
Literally it means “ bottom of a sack , ” but generally it refers to a dead - end street .
Cul - de-sac can also be used metaphorically to express an action that leads to nowhere or an impasse .
But the code of omerta was in effect for two carloads of fans circling the cul - de-sac to have a look at the house .

5. Per se
Per se is a Latin expression that means “ by itself ” or “ intrinsically . ”
The mistake it made with the Xbox is that there is no game console market per se ; there are PlayStation , GameCube , and Xbox markets .

6 . Ad hoc
Ad hoc , borrowed from the Latin , can be used both as an adjective , where it means “ formed or created with a specific purpose , ” and as an adverb , where it means “ for the specific purpose or situation . ”
The World Bank ’s board on Friday ordered an ad hoc group to discuss the fate of President Paul Wolfowitz ( CNN )

The Los Angeles city attorney ’s office filed false - imprisonment and dependent - care - endangerment charges against hospital giant Kaiser Permanente on Wednesday , the first criminal prosecution of a medical center accused of “ dumping ” patients on skid row .
The charges stem from an incident earlier this year when a 63 - year - old patient from Kaiser Permanente ’s Bellflower hospital was videotaped as she left a taxi in gown and socks , and then wandered skid row streets .
In addition to the criminal charges , the city attorney filed a civil lawsuit against Kaiser , using a state law on unfair business practices that city prosecutors usually implement against unscrupulous slumlords to force them to clean up their buildings .
The suit seeks a judge ’s order to forbid all Kaiser medical facilities from dumping homeless patients on skid row or impose financial sanctions if it violates the order .
Kaiser is one of 10 area hospitals under investigation by city prosecutors for allegedly discharging patients to the 50 - block area of downtown that is known for missions and homeless encampments .
City Atty .
Rocky Delgadillo said Wednesday that the Kaiser case was a first step in holding hospitals accountable for dumping .
“ We seek to end the inhumane and illegal practice , ” Delgadillo said .
“ We believe this is the right action to take and it speaks to this region ’s values .
We are in the right place at the right time to hold Kaiser accountable . ”
A Kaiser spokeswoman on Wednesday said she was “ very surprised ” by the charges .
“ I ca n’t understand how these charges would be levied based on what I know of the incident , ” said Diana Bonta , vice president of public affairs for Kaiser Southern California .
She said Kaiser had changed some of its practices since the March incident to better serve discharged homeless patients .
“ As soon as we heard about it , we said this is not how we do business , ” she said .
“ And we apologized .
Since then , we have been talking not only with the city attorney ’s office , but we ’ve worked with the agencies that service the homeless . ”
The indictment marks a turning point in the city ’s yearlong effort to halt the practice by hospitals , as well as some outside law enforcement agencies , of dumping patients and criminals on downtown ’s troubled skid row .
The push comes as city leaders are trying to crack down on crime and blight in the district , which has the largest concentration of homeless people in the western United States .
The LAPD recently began more aggressive police patrols , and Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa has vowed to find more housing to get transients off the street .
In Sacramento , lawmakers earlier this year passed legislation designed to reduce dumping homeless people by requiring all municipalities to devise plans to help their homeless populations .
Legal experts said the Kaiser lawsuit was novel but did have some legal precedent .
“ This may be a bit of creative lawyering , but when they first used these kind of tactics against slumlords , it raised eyebrows but worked , ” said Laurie Levenson , a law professor at Loyola Law School .
“ Corporations can be charged with crimes , ” she said .
“ In many ways it is better to go after the corporate entity as a prosecutor when it is a matter of policy and practice . ”
Unfamiliar with skid row
City officials have been in contact with Reyes since the March incident , when a “ dumping cam ” at the Union Rescue Mission , installed last year after Los Angeles police began accusing hospitals and police agencies elsewhere of dumping people on skid row , captured Reyes ’ arrival in the downtown zone .
She wandered for about three minutes on busy San Pedro Street and then on the sidewalk before workers at the mission brought her inside .
Reyes , who was interviewed after the incident , said she could not remember what happened after she left the hospital or how she got to skid row .
According to the 20 - page court filing , Reyes was brought by ambulance to the Bellflower hospital on March 17 .
At the time , she was suffering from dementia , living in the park and “ regularly collecting and recycling cans and bottles as a way to generate income for herself , ” court documents said .
Reyes spent three days at the hospital for treatment of facial wounds .
The day she was discharged , March 20 , hospital staff members wrote on her chart that she was “ non-talkative , ” “ forgetful ” and “ disoriented , ” according to court documents .
“ Despite these findings , ” prosecutors said , “ the Kaiser Bellflower staff made no other efforts to assess or treat her medical condition . ”
Instead , the documents say , hospital staff “ summoned a taxicab and directed the taxi driver to transport Ms. Reyes to skid row , approximately 16 miles away .
[ She ] was literally rushed out of the hospital and into the taxi even though the hospital staff could not locate her clothes .
[ T ] hey escorted her to the taxi without any pants , even though Ms. Reyes expressed concern about her clothes . ”
Court documents allege that Reyes was not told that she was being taken to skid row .
After Reyes arrived at skid row , Union Rescue Mission staff members worked out a special arrangement so that she could remain in the facility during the day rather than check out the next morning and re-apply for a bed later in the day .
But three days after her discharge from Bellflower , according to the documents , Reyes “ lost consciousness in the bathroom of URM , falling and suffering head trauma . ”
Jeff Isaacs , head of the city attorney ’s criminal division , said Reyes was subsequently hospitalized at Los Angeles County - USC Medical Center , where she was diagnosed with pneumonia , anemia and dementia , a progressive brain dysfunction , and remained in the hospital for at least 45 days .
A guardian has been appointed to protect her interests , Isaacs said .
Reyes also is being represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California and Public Counsel .
Representatives from both organizations said Wednesday that they planned to file a second lawsuit on Reyes ’ behalf soon .
“ This is the first case in the nation where there is a joint effort by government and civil rights groups to halt the practice of hospital dumping , ” said Mark Rosenbaum , the ACLU ’s legal director .
Rosenbaum said that meetings with Kaiser and hospitals failed to yield reform — and that was part of the reason for the court filings .
“ It is like they lit a match to the Hippocratic oath , ” he said .
Dan Grunfeld , president and chief executive officer of Public Counsel , the largest pro-bono legal firm in the nation , echoed that sentiment .
“ This is as stark a case as you are likely to find , ” he said .
“ You have a relatively older woman in adult diapers and gown dumped on a skid row sidewalk .
That is a pretty profound statement .
Ms Reyes is not alone .
There are a lot of Ms. Reyes ’ out there .
We hope to achieve a systemic change . ”
Several hospitals accused
City prosecutors said they spent months examining more than 40 allegations that hospitals had dropped patients on skid row after discharge , often against the patient ’s wishes .
The investigation yielded 15 potential cases , they said .
The cases included a man with a foot wound who was dropped on skid row by a taxi after being discharged from a Covina area hospital and a man left outside the Union Rescue Mission last year with a head gash .
If convicted , Kaiser Permanente would be placed on probation that would limit its behavior and contain potential penalties .
Any criminal finding could influence a medical facility ’s bonding and its ratings by medical organizations .
Kaiser ’s Bonta said the hospital group was committed to treating homeless patients with respect and care .
After the Reyes case , Kaiser stopped using taxis to transport patients to skid row .
It now uses a van service .
Hospital officials are instructed to notify skid row providers in advance if they are sending a discharged patient there .
Moreover , the van driver is supposed to escort the patient inside the facility and ensure that a handoff occurs , she said .
“ These issues with the homeless are difficult and complex , ” Bonta said .
“ It takes all of us working together to find the best way to ensure that care is rendered through this process . ”

Remotely Eavesdropping on Cell Phone Microphones
I give a talk called “ The Future of Privacy , ” where I talk about current and future technological developments that erode our privacy .
One of the things I talk about is auditory eavesdropping , and I hypothesize that a cell phone microphone could be turned on surreptitiously and remotely .
I never had any actual evidence one way or the other , but the technique has surfaced in an organized crime prosecution :
The surveillance technique came to light in an opinion published this week by U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan .
He ruled that the “ roving bug ” was legal because federal wiretapping law is broad enough to permit eavesdropping even of conversations that take place near a suspect ’s cell phone .
Kaplan ’s opinion said that the eavesdropping technique “ functioned whether the phone was powered on or off . ”
Some handsets ca n’t be fully powered down without removing the battery ; for instance , some Nokia models will wake up when turned off if an alarm is set .
Seems that the technique is to download eavesdropping software into the phone :
The U.S. Commerce Department ’s security office warns that “ a cellular telephone can be turned into a microphone and transmitter for the purpose of listening to conversations in the vicinity of the phone . ”
An article in the Financial Times last year said mobile providers can “ remotely install a piece of software on to any handset , without the owner ’s knowledge , which will activate the microphone even when its owner is not making a call . ”
Nextel and Samsung handsets and the Motorola Razr are especially vulnerable to software downloads that activate their microphones , said James Atkinson , a counter - surveillance consultant who has worked closely with government agencies .
“ They can be remotely accessed and made to transmit room audio all the time , ” he said .
“ You can do that without having physical access to the phone . ” [ … ]
Details of how the Nextel bugs worked are sketchy .
Court documents , including an affidavit ( p1 ) and ( p2 ) prepared by Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Kolodner in September 2003 , refer to them as a “ listening device placed in the cellular telephone . ”
That phrase could refer to software or hardware .
One private investigator interviewed by CNET News.com , Skipp Porteous of Sherlock Investigations in New York , said he believed the FBI planted a physical bug somewhere in the Nextel handset and did not remotely activate the microphone .
“ They had to have physical possession of the phone to do it , ” Porteous said .
“ There are several ways that they could have gotten physical possession .
Then they monitored the bug from fairly near by . ”
But other experts thought microphone activation is the more likely scenario , mostly because the battery in a tiny bug would not have lasted a year and because court documents say the bug works anywhere “ within the United States ” –in other words , outside the range of a nearby FBI agent armed with a radio receiver .
In addition , a paranoid Mafioso likely would be suspicious of any ploy to get him to hand over a cell phone so a bug could be planted .
And Kolodner ’s affidavit seeking a court order lists Ardito ’s phone number , his 15 - digit International Mobile Subscriber Identifier , and lists Nextel Communications as the service provider , all of which would be unnecessary if a physical bug were being planted .
A BBC article from 2004 reported that intelligence agencies routinely employ the remote - activation method .
“ A mobile sitting on the desk of a politician or businessman can act as a powerful , undetectable bug , ” the article said , “ enabling them to be activated at a later date to pick up sounds even when the receiver is down . ”
For its part , Nextel said through spokesman Travis Sowders : “ We ’re not aware of this investigation , and we were n’t asked to participate . ”

Life in the Ginormous Little Town
Among those who became aware earlier this year of the fall 2005 communications between Mr. Foley and the 16 - year - old page , who worked for Representative Rodney Alexander , Republican of Louisiana , were Representative John A. Boehner , the majority leader , and Representative Thomas M. Reynolds of New York , chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee .
Mr. Reynolds said in a statement Saturday that he had also personally raised the issue with Speaker J. Dennis Hastert .
“ Despite the fact that I had not seen the e-mails in question , and Mr. Alexander told me that the parents did n’t want the matter pursued , I told the speaker of the conversation Mr. Alexander had with me , ” Mr. Reynolds said .
In a chronology of the episode released later on Saturday , the speaker ’s office said Mr. Hastert did not recall any such discussion and had no previous knowledge of the matter .
“ While the speaker does not explicitly recall this conversation , he has no reason to dispute Congressman Reynolds ’ recollection that he reported to him on the problem and its resolution , ” the statement said .
The statement , issued after senior aides , the House clerk and legal advisers huddled for much of Saturday in the Capitol , said senior staff members in the speaker ’s office first learned of the e-mail messages from Mr. Alexander ’s office in the fall of 2005 and took steps to investigate .
Aides to the speaker and other Congressional Republican leaders said the messages , which an Alexander aide described to them as “ overfriendly , ” were much less explicit than the others that came to light after ABC News first disclosed the e-mail correspondence with Mr. Alexander ’s page .
The aides said Mr. Alexander ’s office , at the request of the page ’s family , did not show them copies of the messages .
In those messages , sent after Hurricane Katrina , Mr. Foley asked about the well - being of the boy , a Monroe , La. , resident .
He wrote : “ How are you weathering the hurricane .
. .are you safe .
. . send me a pic of you as well . ”
The page sent the note to a former colleague , describing it as “ sick . ”
Almost all voted for Bush in 2000 .
Serving their civilian neoconservative superiors , they endured contempt .
Donald Rumsfeld 's closest aide , the undersecretary of defence for intelligence , Stephen Cambone , joked that the army 's problems " could be solved by lining up 50 of its generals in the Pentagon and gunning them down " , according to Michael Gordon and General Bernard Trainor in their new book on the Iraq invasion , Cobra II .
In September 2001 , Rumsfeld held a Pentagon meeting where he declared the " bureaucracy " - the career professionals - to be " a serious threat to the security of the United States " .
The generals have been wary of engaging in public debate for fear of being misconstrued as political .
But they are haunted by Vietnam and deeply influenced by HR McMaster 's 1997 book , Dereliction of Duty , which argues that the joint chiefs of staff of the Vietnam era failed in their constitutional responsibility to object strenuously to misguided strategies .
( McMaster is a general serving in Iraq . )
As the generals have stepped forward to demand Rumsfeld 's resignation , they speak in the language of McMaster 's book .
On March 19 , retired Major General Paul Eaton , who was in charge of training the Iraqi army , called Rumsfeld " incompetent strategically , operationally and tactically " .
On April 2 , retired General Anthony Zinni , former chief of US Central Command , said : " Poor military judgment has been used throughout this mission . "
On April 9 , retired Lieutenant General Gregory Newbold wrote : " I now regret that I did not more openly challenge those who were determined to invade a country whose actions were peripheral to the real threat - al - Qaida . "
On April 13 , retired Major General John Riggs and Major General Charles Swannack , former commander of the 82nd Airborne , went public .
" They only need the military advice when it satisfies their agenda , " said Riggs .
Swannack emphasised that Rumsfeld bore " culpability " for the abuses at Abu Ghraib .
In response , the Bush administration has mounted a full - scale PR defence .
Rumsfeld appeared in the guise of King Solomon on rightwing radio talkshow host Rush Limbaugh 's programme : " This , too , will pass . "
Bush proposed a syllogism : " I 'm the decider , and I decide what 's best .
And what 's best is for Don Rumsfeld to remain . "
But the revolt of the generals , speaking for much of the serving senior officer corps , is unprecedented in scope and depth .
The White House press secretary , Scott McClellan , resigned this week partly to distract attention from Rumsfeld .
Clinging to Rumsfeld as indispensable to his strength , Bush reveals his fragility .
Their denial extends beyond the realities of Iraq and its history to that of the US .
Bush & co disdained nation building as something soft and weak connected to the Clinton presidency , just as they belittled and neglected terrorism as a Clinton obsession before September 11 , and as the president dismissed history as weightless .
" History ?
We do n't know .
We 'll all be dead , " Bush remarked in 2003 .
" We cannot escape history , " said Abraham Lincoln .
The living president has already sealed his reputation in history .

COPENHAGEN ( Reuters ) - Danish police rounded up foreigners it said had helped fuel a wave of violence that followed the eviction of activists from a Copenhagen youth center earlier this week .

The arrests followed some of the worst violence early on Saturday , when police fought street battles with hundreds of youths who torched cars and vandalized a local school .
Media reports said organizers sought to rally supporters for fresh demonstrations via mass cell phone text messages .
Police were braced for fresh clashes on Saturday night and drafted reinforcements from other districts and borrowed police vans from Sweden , police spokesman Flemming Steen Munch said .
Attempts to restart violence on Saturday night were quickly quashed by police .
A demonstration in Copenhagen ’s multi-ethnic , working class Norrebro district was dispersed by police when some youths began hurling Molotov cocktails .
Earlier in the day , a peaceful demonstration was held ending in Norrebro district , the focus of recent protests with the hippie enclave Christiania .
“ It ’s a lot calmer tonight , ” a police officer said .
Police said they raided houses , schools and hostels , detaining about 100 activists , half of whom foreigners .
Local media said more than 600 people have been held since the violence erupted on Thursday .
They included Germans , Swedes , Norwegians , Italians , Irish , British and Spaniards .
Police said detained foreigners raids would be expelled .
The conflict over the youth center has simmered since 2000 when local government , which had lent it to the youngsters since 1982 , sold the building to a religious group .
Police moved to evict the squatters early on Thursday , implementing a court order issued last year .
VEHICLES TORCHED
Earlier on Saturday , Copenhagen saw some of the worst violence since the eviction of the squatters .
Witnesses said protesters vandalized a high school , threw cobblestones at police and smashed shop windows .
Two police officers and three protesters have been injured , police said .
Minister of justice Lene Espersen on Friday praised the way police handled the protests to minimize injuries , and also urged parents to persuade their children not to resort to violence .
Activists have vowed to keep up the protests to retake control of the worn - down building in Norrebro in which artists such as Nick Cave and Bjork have performed .
The youths have repeatedly called for a political solution to the dispute over the youth center but rejected a proposal to move to another building .
Danish police in 1993 for the first and only time since World War Two fired into a demonstration , the night of a referendum on the European Union Maastricht treaty .
A total of 113 shots were fired and nine people hurt , prompting a public outcry and a reform of police strategy .
The scope of recent violence has stunned this relatively wealthy and peaceful Nordic country .
But Denmark has a tradition of non-conformism and tolerance for rebellion against authorities , and many Copenhagen residents say they support the youngsters ’ wish to stay in the youth house .
“ The struggle will continue for a long time .
As long as there is no Youth House in Copenhagen , there will be a fight to get one , ” said Jan , a spokesman for the youth center .
The incredible disappearing sysadmin
New technologies are making it easier than ever to do without the expensive techs who monitor servers , sending their jobs offshore .
SAN FRANCISCO ( Business 2.0 Magazine ) -- Nearly half of U.S. IT jobs involve the upkeep and maintenance of computers - a sector previously thought to be safe from offshoring .
But technological change is sweeping the industry , and soon the servers that host your favorite websites or run your online banking could be run from halfway around the world .
Almost any company , of course , stands to benefit from reducing its computing costs .
But there 's also a huge opportunity for companies that can help cut those costs :
Worldwide spending on systems administration , as it's known , is an estimated $ 110 billion a year .
In the U.S. , systems administrators make an average of $ 29 per hour .
Moving those jobs to India could save companies up to 60 % per year , according to a new McKinsey study .
Who 's poised to profit
The first group of companies that are likely to cash in are the Indian IT services firms that have already parlayed India 's cheaper labor into outsourcing contracts to develop software and run call centers for U.S. companies .
Tata Consultancy Services ( Charts ) and Wipro ( Charts ) are ahead of rivals like Infosys ( Charts ) in tapping the remote systems administration market .
Then there are software and hardware makers whose products help automate systems administration .
Any process that 's automated , after all , is that much easier to hand off to an outsourcer .
Sun Microsystems ( Charts ) , for example , has introduced so - called " lights - out " features into its servers , which allow the remote diagnosis of physical problems that used to require an administrator 's presence .
And companies like Splunk , a San Francisco startup , are developing software that speeds up routine administration tasks .
The biggest winners , though , may be players like IBM ( Charts ) and Hewlett - Packard ( Charts ) , which offer a complete package of all of the above - increasingly automated hardware , sophisticated monitoring software , and IT consultants who can design , build , and manage the combination .
Lights out for sysadmins
The result of these innovations :
While the servers themselves will likely remain here in the U.S. , they 'll need fewer sysadmins , and it will be easier than ever to have those sysadmins based overseas .
The notion of more IT jobs moving offshore is likely to set off predictable controversy .
But the truth is that systems administration is increasingly becoming a more remote , hands - off job , with servers already clustered in data centers , albeit here in the U.S. , far from the administrators who monitor them .
Many data centers today operate with their lights dimmed - darkened homes for servers that only get visited when their minders indicate that they need attention .
And if the administrators are n't in the same building , does it matter if they 're on the same continent ?
" The end - state is for large corporations to have a couple large data centers in the U.S. , in Europe , and in Asia , " with systems administrators distributed around the world , says James Kaplan , who is an IT infrastructure consultant at McKinsey , and one of the study 's lead authors .
Kaplan says that , at most , 20 to 50 percent of systems administration work will remain in high - cost areas like the U.S. and Western Europe .
For those only casually familiar with the IT outsourcing trend , it 's easy to assume that systems administration is part of the work already parceled out to offshore companies .
But that 's not the case .
According to Kaplan 's research , few offshore IT contracts involve systems administration work today .
A variety of factors have limited this type of offshoring .
For one thing , maintenance of many systems used to require hooking up a keyboard and monitor to a server to diagnose problems .
That could only be done in person , requiring skilled personnel close to the server .
And monitoring a system remotely requires a rock - solid network connection , something that was hard to get overseas .
Furthermore , the trained personnel to run such operations simply did n't exist overseas until recently .
India 's technical colleges had focused on training graduates for software programming .
But that , too , is changing : According to Kaplan , the number of trained systems administrators in low - cost markets like India tripled from 5,000 in 2003 to 15,000 in 2005 .
Coaxing reluctant IT managers
As a result , companies once reluctant to outsource crucial database and mainframe management are now reconsidering .
More mature server - monitoring software from IBM and HP , coupled with improved networks overseas , has made reliance on offshore monitoring centers easier for U.S. IT managers to stomach .
The offshore server monitoring and maintenance market stands to grow to $ 3 billion dollars by 2007 , according to McKinsey .
To address this growing market , Tata has built a 250,000 - sq. ft. network operations center in Chennai , India , from which it monitors and manages U.S. and European servers .
The company now remotely manages servers for 120 clients , up from 73 at the beginning of 2005 , including the likes of Verizon and Alcoa .
Smaller players , like San Francisco - based Splunk , have also benefited .
Splunk 's software indexes log files , the automatically generates records of a computer 's activities , to make them easier to search and help diagnose problems .
The company 's software is used in continent - spanning projects by Tata , Computer Sciences Corporation , and EDS .
Opsware , a publicly traded software company based in Sunnyvale , Calif. , also could get a boost from the trend , since it makes software that automates server installation and management .
And who stands to lose ?
Chiefly the 270,000 people employed as sysadmins in the U.S.
But with only 15,000 low - cost replacements available overseas , it 's unlikely their jobs will be at immediate risk .
And realistically , this wave of offshoring is most likely to eliminate the most annoying , repetitive parts of their jobs , freeing them up for more creative work .
Sysadmins of the world , unite - you have nothing to lose but your server log files .

Here 's another macro that would be hard to do with just closures and reference parameters .
It 's also reeeeally hard to do in C , because C does n't have a very good representation for program fragments ( just strings ) and does n't even have good ways for a macro to pick apart that representation .
So I 'll have to conduct the example in Lisp only .
The goal is to have something that looks like a function that takes a ( numerical ) function as an argument and finds its roots , or a root .
Something like this : ( findroots ( lambda ( a ) (* ( sin a ) (+ a ( * 3 a ) ) ) ) )
There are various ways this can be done .
But for our purposes , we wish to implement this in terms of a function " newton " that takes two arguments , both of which are numerical functions , where the second argument implements the derivative of the first argument .
So , for example , ( newton ( lambda ( x ) (* 3 x ) ) ( lambda ( x ) 3 ) ) would return the root of the linear equation y = 3*x , and ( newton #' sin #'cos ) would return a root ( or all the roots :-) of the function " sin " .
To save the programmer the trouble of writing out , or even figuring out , the derivative of the function in question , we will code " findroots " as a macro and require that it be given an actual lambda expression , not just the name of a function .
( defmacro findroots ( lx ) ( let ( ( var ( first ( second lx ) ) ) ( body ( third lx ) ) ) ( labels ( ( diff ( e v ) ( cond ( ( atom e ) ( if ( eq e v ) 1 0 ) ) ( ( eq ( first e ) '+ ) `(+ , ( diff ( second e ) v ) , ( diff ( third e ) v ) ) ) ( ( eq ( first e ) '-) ( if ( null ( rest ( rest e ) ) ) `(- , ( diff ( second e ) v ) ) `(- , ( diff ( second e ) v ) , ( diff ( third e ) v ) ) ) ) ( ( eq ( first e ) '*) `(+ (* , ( diff ( third e ) v ) , ( second e ) ) (* , ( diff ( second e ) v ) , ( third e ) ) ) ) ( ( eq ( first e ) ' sin ) `(* ( cos , ( second e ) ) , ( diff ( second e ) v ) ) ) ( ( eq ( first e ) ' cos ) `(* (- ( sin , ( second e ) ) ) , ( diff ( second e ) v ) ) ) ) ) ) `( newton , lx ( lambda ( , var ) , ( diff body var ) ) ) ) ) )
What this is doing is tearing apart the lambda expression symbolically , computing a symbolic derivative , blindly using all the usual rules one learns in first - semester calculus .
Note that the " labels " construct allows one to locally define one or more recursive procedures within an expression .
( To clarify the exposition , I have omitted all the error - checking code that an expert macro programmer would have inserted in the definition of " findroots " to ensure that the argument to the macro is well - formed . )
The expansion of the macro invocation ( findroots ( lambda ( a ) (* ( sin a ) (+ a (* 3 a ) ) ) ) ) is ( NEWTON ( LAMBDA ( A ) (* ( SIN A ) (+ A (* 3 A ) ) ) ) ( LAMBDA ( A ) (+ (* (+ 1 (+ (* 1 3 ) (* 0 A ) ) ) ( SIN A ) ) (* (* ( COS A ) 1 ) (+ A (* 3 A ) ) ) ) ) ) ( as actually computed by " Liquid Common Lisp " version 5.0.3 ) and you can see that the second argument to " newton " is indeed the ( completely unsimplified ) symbolic derivative of the first argument .
It is not too difficult to have the macro make some simplifications as it goes , by using two utility functions " make - sum " and " make - prod " that check for certain special cases , such as x+0 = x and x*0 = 0 : ( defmacro findroots ( lx ) ( let ( ( var ( first ( second lx ) ) ) ( body ( third lx ) ) ) ( labels ( ( make - sum ( p q ) ( cond ( ( and ( numberp p ) ( numberp q ) ) (+ p q ) ) ( ( equal p 0 ) q ) ( ( equal q 0 ) p ) ( t `(+ , p , q ) ) ) ) ( make - prod ( p q ) ( cond ( ( and ( numberp p ) ( numberp q ) ) ( * p q ) ) ( ( equal p 0 ) 0 ) ( ( equal q 0 ) 0 ) ( ( equal p 1 ) q ) ( ( equal q 1 ) p ) ( t `(* , p , q ) ) ) ) ( diff ( e v ) ( cond ( ( atom e ) ( if ( eq e v ) 1 0 ) ) ( ( eq ( first e ) '+ ) ( make - sum ( diff ( second e ) v ) ( diff ( third e ) v ) ) ) ( ( eq ( first e ) '-) ( if ( null ( rest ( rest e ) ) ) `(- , ( diff ( second e ) v ) ) `(- , ( diff ( second e ) v ) , ( diff ( third e ) v ) ) ) ) ( ( eq ( first e ) '*) ( make - sum ( make - prod ( diff ( third e ) v ) ( second e ) ) ( make - prod ( diff ( second e ) v ) ( third e ) ) ) ) ( ( eq ( first e ) ' sin ) ( make - prod `( cos , ( second e ) ) ( diff ( second e ) v ) ) ) ( ( eq ( first e ) ' cos ) ( make - prod `(- ( sin , ( second e ) ) ) ( diff ( second e ) v ) ) ) ) ) ) `( newton , lx ( lambda ( , var ) , ( diff body var ) ) ) ) ) )
Then expansion of that same macro invocation ( findroots ( lambda ( a ) (* ( sin a ) (+ a (* 3 a ) ) ) ) ) is ( NEWTON ( LAMBDA ( A ) (* ( SIN A ) (+ A (* 3 A ) ) ) ) ( LAMBDA ( A ) (+ (* 4 ( SIN A ) ) (* ( COS A ) (+ A (* 3 A ) ) ) ) ) )
Note that this particular implementation of " findroots " does not attempt any simplification of the given function itself , nor any simplification of fragments of that given function in the derivative ; that 's why we still see " (+ A (* 3 A ) ) " rather than " (* 4 A ) " in the code .
But it 's still a bit prettier ( and more efficient ) than before .
It has simplified " (+ 1 (+ (* 1 3 ) (* 0 A ) ) ) " to " 4 " and has simplified " (* ( COS A ) 1 ) " to " ( COS A ) " .
By the way : to fans of Lisp macros , any macro facility incapable of this particular application is not the true macro facility .

The case of the two Fox News journalists , held hostage in Gaza , is worth dwelling upon .
. . .
The degree to which our starch is awash is exhibited in the behaviour of so many of our captives , but especially in these two .
They were told to convert to Islam under implicit threat ( blindfolded and hand - tied , they could not judge what threat ) , and agreed to make the propaganda broadcasts to guarantee their own safety .
That much we can understand , as conventional cowardice .
( Understand ; not forgive . )
But it is obvious from their later statements that they never thought twice ; that they could see nothing wrong in serving the enemy , so long as it meant they 'd be safe .
. . .
I assume they are not Christians ( few journalists are ) , but had they ever been instructed in that faith , they might have grasped that conversion to Islam means denial of Christ , and that is something many millions of Christians ( few of them intellectuals ) have refused to do , even at the cost of excruciating deaths . . .
And the two Fox journalists , whom I will not stoop to name , begged for their lives even though , in retrospect , their lives probably were n't in danger .
. . .
Men without chests , men without character , men who do n't think twice .
Q : If you 're a kid and you 've had enough of the school bullies pants - ing you in the cafeteria , what 's one of the smartest things you can do ?
A : Punch one of them in the nose as hard as you can and then stand your ground .
UPDATE
When Fox News journalists Steve Centanni and Olaf Wiig were being held by Gaza kidnappers , they were used as solemn symbols of our grand struggle against Islamic fascists .
But ever since they were released , physically unharmed , they have become , as John Amato documented the other day , the targets of the same sort of hostility and bizarre resentment which was directed at Jill Carroll when she was released .
It 's almost as though the fact that they were n't killed -- and then refused to read some fictitious propaganda script about their captivity -- instantaneously transformed them from glorious martyrs in the War on Terror to impediments which needed to be neutralized through attacks on their mental health and character .
Yesterday , David Warren , a columnist for Real Clear Politics and The Ottawa Citizen , attacked Centanni and Wiig for being cowards and " men without chests " and said that they illustrate so much of what is wrong with the West and why we are losing to the Islamofascists : Warren argues that the cowardice of the two Fox journalists in saving their own lives illustrates why we are losing the War of Civilizations -- because of what Warren calls the " Chestlessness " of our " men . "
As Warren puts it : " That is the substance of most Islamo - fascist propaganda : that the West consists of straw men , of men without chests , of men easily pushed over . "
To Warren , the cowardly chestlessness of Western men is why " the West is proving unable to cope with a threat from a fanatical Islamic movement , that it ought to be able to snuff out with fair ease .
" Warren has a biography page on his website .
In telling us about himself , Warren complains that " the thumb on ( his ) right hand still hurts sometimes from when it was broken in a dodgeball game , " tells us that his favorite sport is cricket , talks of his love for Ella Fitzgerald and Jane Austen , touts his devout Catholicism , confesses that he has " been estranged [ from his wife of 18 years ] for going on four years , " and says he is " fascinated by seeds , small shells , tiny fishes , & insects .
" He also has a picture of himself , which I admit to finding genuinely relevant , for reasons I have explained here .
In this case , what is so striking about it is Warren 's shocking , almost - complete physical resemblance to other rhetorical tough guy warriors like Hugh Hewitt and John Hinderaker .
Perhaps most revealingly , this Crusader for Masculine Chestfulness confesses that he " could barely even pass phys .
ed. , " but assures us that he was " Not weak , especially ; just more - or - less incapable of following orders . "
But do n't worry , he assures us : " I am heterosexual . "
And while Warren denounces as " cowards " journalists like Centanni and Wiig who travel to Gaza and other war zones ( Centanni was the first journalist on the scene where Saddam Hussein 's two sons were killed ) , he gently , and with grand understatement , pronounces himself " an idle person .
" Our foreign policy is driven at least as much by psychological factors as political ones -- at least .
So much of the bellicose , tough - guy warmongering to which we are subjected on a daily basis -- all the talk about not wanting to be weak , scared , appeasers who run from fights -- is generated by the same forces that account for David Warren , someone who calls journalists in Gaza " cowards " while he lounges around listening to Ella Fitzgerald and whining about his sore thumb , someone who demands that other men risk their lives and more and more people be incinerated so that he can finally feel strong and courageous and powerful while he sits around complaining about Earl Grey tea ( " Earl Grey is an especially contemptible tea , for it was first blended in the kitchens of the notorious Whig statesman " ) .
David Warren really is a poster child for so much of the forces driving our country to endless wars and reckless destruction .
It 's the same mindset that allows people who have never sacrificed or risked anything for their country to accuse those who have risked their lives of being cowards and appeasers ( see Jack Murtha , John Kerry , Wesley Clark , and on and on and on ) .
Hey , Jonah Goldberg - why do you favor the war in Iraq ?
But for people like Jonah and David Warren , that is accomplished by urging fights where they have nothing at risk .
This is not a " chickenhawk " argument .
It is far beyond that .
So much of our public dialogue is dominated by people -- exactly like David Warren -- desperate to bask in the reflected glory of epic warriors without ever risking anything and to feel powerful and strong and resolute and " full - chested " while sitting at home , protected and safe but still scared of everything .
They are people who have an endless need to parade themselves around as courageous nobles without ever doing anything noble or courageous . : Jon Swift examines the anger directed by others at the Fox News journalists for being released alive by the Islamofascists , while TBogg provides a graphic illustration of our brave warrior .
Padilla suffered brain damage during captivity , experts say
By Tom Carter
24 February 2007
On February 22 , two expert defense witnesses testified that José Padilla suffered brain injuries during the course of his detention in a US naval brig and that he is mentally unable to stand trial .
Padilla , a US citizen , was arrested at O’Hare Airport in Chicago in May 2002 and declared a “ material witness ” in the investigation into the September 11 terrorist attacks .
In June 2002 he was designated an “ enemy combatant ” by the Bush administration , which claimed he was an Al Qaeda operative and had been plotting to explode a radioactive “ dirty bomb ” in a US city .
He was subsequently held , without charges and in defiance of fundamental democratic rights , in a South Carolina naval brig .
According to a brief filed by his lawyers , he was deliberately and systematically tortured for the three - and - a - half years duration of his incarceration .
( See “ Citing torture , lawyers for Jose Padilla argue case should be dismissed ” )
Patricia Zapf , an associate professor at the City University of New York and clinical forensic psychologist , testified that Padilla exhibited a “ strong indication of cognitive impairment . ”
She estimated that there was a 98 percent chance that he had suffered brain injuries during his confinement .
Dr. Zapf described Padilla as “ immobilized by anxiety ” whenever he was questioned about his incarceration and treatment .
“ He said he ca n’t relive it , he ca n’t go through it again , and he ca n’t name names , ” she said .
Angela Hegarty , a forensic neuropsychiatrist and assistant professor of clinical psychology at Columbia University , argued that Padilla did not fully understand the legal proceedings now under way , and that he is convinced that they represent yet another stage of his interrogation .
For example , he has been disinclined to speak with his attorneys about his experiences in the brig because he thinks they are government agents .
“ He hits a stone wall and his logic shuts down , ” said Dr. Hegarty .
“ His overwhelming anxiety interferes with his reasoning . ”
He is also unable to place events in chronological order , she said .
Both witnesses reiterated the concerns of Padilla ’s legal counsel that he is so terrified of being returned to the brig , where he is convinced he will die , that he will do anything to avoid it , including lie in court about the conditions of his confinement .
Hegarty referred to this behavior as a form of Stockholm syndrome , in which kidnap victims and prisoners in helpless situations are psychologically inclined to defend their captors .
“ When you are helpless and dependent on an all - powerful group , it takes away your anxiety when you line up with them , ” she said .
Padilla fears that if he contradicts the government in court , he will be punished for it when the trial is over .
He is currently being held in a Florida jailhouse .
The witnesses also confirmed that Padilla outwardly exhibits classic symptoms of post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , including hypervigilance , facial tics , and extreme paranoia .
According to a brief filed at the outset of the case , during his confinement Padilla was force - fed drugs such as LSD and PCP , forced into “ stress positions , ” systematically deprived of sleep , subjected to extreme temperatures and noise , kept in total isolation in a tiny cell under 24 - hour surveillance , manacled and hooded for long periods of time , and underwent routine harsh interrogation .
Padilla ’s attorneys , led by Anthony Natale , argue that the damage to Padilla ’s mental faculties is so severe that he is legally unable to stand trial or assist in his own defense .
If the court finds that Padilla is unfit to stand trial , as his lawyers argue , then the trial , scheduled to begin April 16 , cannot go forward .
The government would no doubt appeal such a decision , but in the meantime Padilla would likely be institutionalized and given psychiatric treatment .
Lawyers for the government , led by John C. Shipley , have attempted to stop this from happening by flatly denying that Padilla suffers from PTSD , citing a standardized test he was given while in custody .
The government is also expected to call its own expert psychiatric witness — Rodolfo Buigas , a psychological evaluator for the Bureau of Prisons — who will say that Padilla is fit for trial .
The prosecution has focused as well on an alleged inconsistency in Padilla ’s defense : the defense lawyers argue on the one hand that Padilla is mentally unfit for trial , and simultaneously argue on the other that he is to be believed when he says he was tortured by the US government .
The ongoing legal proceedings themselves are an inconvenience for the Bush administration , which originally arrested Padilla as a test case in the attack on fundamental democratic rights and assertion of police - state executive powers associated with the so - called “ war on terror . ”
Padilla was held incommunicado without trial or charges for almost four years before a November 2005 Supreme Court case threatened to call into question the entire practice of extra-legal detention .
The Bush administration reacted to this development by hastily cobbling together criminal charges against Padilla and indicting him in a Florida criminal court .
While this saved for the moment the denial of elementary democratic and legal rights to so - called “ enemy combatants , ” it forced the government into a courtroom where it is required to provide at least some evidence to substantiate the charges against Padilla .
The new criminal charges against Padilla , it should be noted , bear absolutely no relationship to the allegations of a “ dirty bomb plot ” — made on national television by then attorney general John Ashcroft as well as Bush himself — that constituted the initial justification for his incarceration .
Padilla is now charged with conspiring to murder , kidnap and maim people in a foreign country , as well as two counts of conspiracy and aiding terrorists abroad .
Judge Marcia Cooke , upon examining the new government allegations , acknowledged that the government ’s case was “ light on facts . ”
Padilla pled not guilty .
On February 26 , the military personnel who oversaw Padilla ’s incarceration are scheduled to answer questions in court , although the prosecution aims to block this testimony on the grounds that it will compromise “ national security . ”
Judge Cooke overruled a number of government objections to the testimony of Zapf and Hegarty , however , and may likewise allow Padilla ’s jailers to testify .
What Is Software Design : 13 Years Later Code As Design : Three Essays by Jack W. Reeves .
Click here for the introduction .
This is Part Two of People have occasionally asked whether I did any follow - on writing to my " What Is Software Design " article .
The answer has basically been " No , not really . "
I want to make it clear that that is not because I forgot about it or otherwise changed my mind .
Allow me to offer a bit of explanation .
When the article appeared , I hoped–actually expected –that I would get some type of rebuttal from some sort of industry " expert . "
I was looking forward to this since part of my reason for writing the article had been hopes of stimulating discussion within the software industry about the overall software development process .
Nothing happened .
There were no letters to the editor that I know about and nothing ever sent directly to me .
C++ Journal became defunct shortly after that issue , and I figured my article had gone to that great land fill in the sky that swallows most publications .
I went on to doing other things .
It was n’t until 1997 or 1998 that I got an email from Bob Martin ( who had just taken over as editor of the C++ Report ) letting me know there was a wiki page about my article on Ward Cunningham ’s c2.com web site .
This was –quite literally –the first time I knew anybody had read my article ( other than the people I personally gave a copy to ) .
I started to follow the discussions on the wiki page and occasionally on some news groups , but deliberately stayed out of them myself for several reasons : a ) I was focused on certain other things at the time , b ) it was pretty obvious that other people who had accepted what I was trying to say were just as qualified –maybe more so–to argue the points as I would have been ( I specifically remember Michael Feathers writing ) , and c ) last but not least , it still looked to me like there was a lot of opposition to the concept .
Unfortunately , most of the arguments sounded pretty much like the ones I had been dealing with for almost 15 years by that point ( remember , I had had the idea almost 10 years before I wrote the article ) .
I had grown tired of trying to deal with people who were totally incapable of getting past their own pre-conceptions to even consider the idea rationally .
It was like trying to explain that the French speak a different language to someone who is convinced that " different language " really just means " different dialect of English " .
No matter what you say , they will parse your arguments against their beliefs and either dismiss you out of hand , or patronize you with their counter arguments .
I had seen a number of projects where " design it in the code " worked , but even the people on such projects often refused to accept the reality .
My level of cynicism about being able to improve things was very high .
It still is , but I think it is time I made some attempt to actually defend myself , rather than let other people do it .
Therefore , what I am going to do is address some of the most common criticisms I have seen about " What Is Software Design ? " .
A. Initially , the most common criticism I would see can be summarized as " If source code is the design , then programmers are designers ; but obviously they are not , therefore source code cannot be the design . "
Nobody states it that baldly , but when you parse what they do say , it comes down to the same thing .
These are circular arguments that start with the assumption that programming / coding is a manufacturing type of activity .
In logic , this is known as a " Begging the Question " fallacy .
In essence , these people say " your assumption ( i.e. source code is the design ) contradicts my assumption ( i.e. programmers are assembly workers ) , therefore your assumption must be wrong . "
Someone might suggest that I am doing the same thing , i.e. starting with the assumption that source code is a design .
I accept that –up to a point .
While I will admit that a lot of the article reads like an attempt to prove that " source code is the design " , that was not really what I was trying to do .
The following quote is from the beginning of the article : " This article assumes that final source code is the real software design and then examines some of the consequences of that assumption .
I may not be able to prove that this point of view is correct , but I hope to show that it does explain some of the observed facts of the software industry , ... "
I did not set out to prove that " source code is the design " ; I will readily concede that what is a " design " is to some extent a matter of definition .
The point of the article was to try to show how this assumption led to much better explanations of numerous observed facts .
I am still waiting for anyone to offer better explanations based upon alternative assumptions .
B . These days , thanks in part to the rise of Extreme Programming and other Agile Methods , people are starting to accept ( grudgingly ) that programmers are not assembly line drones .
Unfortunately , that does n’t mean they are willing to accept the concept of " the source code is the design " .
The arguments can be summarized by the example that is still on the wiki page : " As for throwing the whole design thing out , and just designing in code ... Hahahahahahahahah no really Hahahahahahahahah :) "
This really makes me angry .
For reasons that I do not understand , reasonably intelligent people insist upon confusing the concept of design as process versus design as product .
You would think that anyone who passed high school would understand the difference between the process of writing a paper ( for example ) and the paper itself .
Certainly , you would expect anyone with a college background to understand that there are often lots of different ways to arrive at the same solution .
Nevertheless , people keep insisting that my contention of " the source code is the design " means " do n’t do design , just code . "
I never said anything of the sort .
What I did say was : " In software engineering , we desperately need good design at all levels .
In particular , we need good top level design .
The better the early design , the easier detailed design will be .
Designers should use anything that helps .
Structure charts , Booch diagrams , state tables , PDL , etc . — if it helps , then use it . "
Today , I would phrase it differently .
I would say we need good architectures ( top level design ) , good abstractions ( class design ) , and good implementations ( low level design ) .
I would also say something about using UML diagrams or CRC cards to explore alternatives .
Nevertheless , I will not back away from the following statement : " We must keep in mind , however , that these tools and notations are not a software design .
Eventually , we have to create the real software design , and it will be in some programming language .
Therefore , we should not be afraid to code our designs as we derive them . "
This is fundamental .
I am not arguing that we should not " do design . "
However you want to approach the process , I simply insist that you have not completed the process until you have written and tested the code .
Personally , I think a person with his feet on the desk staring at the ceiling can be " doing design " just as seriously as someone playing with UML diagrams in ROSE .
I have always known that you are better off if you put some real thought into what you are trying to do before actually doing it .
People differ widely in what helps them think , however .
Some people use pencil and paper .
Others like white boards or even computer tools .
Some people like to bounce ideas off of other people , others like peace and quiet .
Some people feel comfortable with diagrams like UML .
Others prefer CRC cards .
What approach they choose does n’t matter ; until someone starts insisting that these intermediate designs should be products in their own right .
It ’s the code that matters .
If you get good code , does it really matter how it came about ?
If you do n’t get good code , does it really matter how much other garbage you made people do before they wrote the bad code ?
Everybody that has been in this business any length of time has seen plenty of examples where someone obviously sat down and coded the first thing that popped into their mind .
Later , when it became obvious that there were shortcomings with the approach , there was too much blood , sweat , and " skin " invested in the code to scrap it and do something better .
Fine , we all know a little thought can go a long way .
On the other hand , any of us who has spent time on a traditional development project with its strict rules forbidding the writing of a single line of code until the " design " is completed and reviewed and approved , etc. knows you can waste a hell of a lot of time producing documents that are out of date literally days after the actual coding starts .
Why bother ?
You think we could find some happy medium of " enough " design effort , but not too much .
There is no such thing .
The only way we validate a software design is by building it and testing it .
There is no silver bullet , and no " right way " to do design .
Sometimes an hour , a day , or even a week spent thinking about a problem can make a big difference when the coding actually starts .
Other times , 5 minutes of testing will reveal something you never would have thought about no matter how long you tried .
We do the best we can under the circumstances , and then refine it .
One last comment : I also did not say that the only necessary documentation is the source code .
I specifically pointed out in the article : " ... auxiliary documentation is as important for a software project as it is for a hardware project . "
The source code may be the master design document , but it is seldom the only one necessary .
B ’. I cannot resist making a remark about a side issue that often comes up in discussions about Extreme Programming and Agile methods that is related to the above .
This is often phrased as a question : what about the Less Able Programmer ?
The issue seems to be that only the very best programmers can " design " and " code " at the same time .
To offset this , we must have all those intermediate design steps and products mentioned above to make up for the lack of experience and talent of the average programmer .
To me , this is like asking " what do we do about the less able physician ? "
I know the practice of medicine and software development are not analogous , but bear with me for a moment .
An awful lot of the practice of medicine is pretty much rote ( we joke about " take two aspirin and call me tomorrow " ) .
Nevertheless , the medical profession still insists upon some pretty high standards of intelligence , education , and experience before someone is allowed to call themselves an MD .
In other words , we want our doctors to know what they are doing .
In software development , questions about the less able programmer really come down to trying to substitute a process for intelligence , aptitude , and experience .
Apparently , a lot of people think that if we force people to create enough UML diagrams ( or whatever ) , have enough reviews , and otherwise follow a detailed process , that eventually they will figure out what they are doing and code it correctly .
There is no evidence that such approaches have worked in the past , and I see no reason to believe they will work in the future .
In fact , my own experience says that properly using tools such as UML involves a considerable level of expertise and experience in its own right .
C. Another argument I have seen questions the contention that the goal of an engineering effort is some type of documentation .
Some people argue that the goal of engineering is a " product " and that real engineers often " build " things and those " things " are as much a product of engineering as any documentation .
This argument tries to sidestep the question of " What is a Software Design ? " by implying a parallel between the " things " that other engineers build and what software developers create .
Frankly , this is nonsense .
I will concede that there are engineers who build " things " with little or no formal design documentation , although I suspect that even in those cases there is probably some design documentation ( even if it is on the back of an envelope ) .
In any case , I think we can safely say that such projects produce only one - off products and are usually done by individuals .
When an " engineering " effort starts involving more than a couple of people , or when it has a formal manufacturing phase , then documentation starts to loom larger and larger as the actual product of the engineering effort .
You better believe that the engineers at Toyota or Motorola produce documentation , and we ’ll not even think about the engineers at Boeing or Lockheed .
So , while it might be true that a lot of engineers do things besides producing design documents , anyone who calls himself an engineer knows what a design document in his field looks like , and probably produces such more often than not .
Can we say the same for " software engineers " ?
Incidentally , this contention regarding engineers and documentation was not mine originally , but instead something I picked up from an article in Datamation back in 1979 .
I agree with it completely however .
D. One final but fairly minor argument I have seen is that source code is still too high level to be a design .
At least one critic wanted to call source code the " specification . "
His ( or her ) take was that the real design is what comes out of the compiler .
In some sense this is just a matter of definition , but I still disagree with it .
The generally accepted definition is that a " specification " states the what , which is followed by a design document that details the how .
While there is a certain amount of flexibility allowed of the compiler in determining the how of object code , there is certainly no creativity involved .
And that is where I draw the line .
When the document is detailed enough , complete enough , and unambiguous enough that it can be interpreted mechanistically , whether by a computer or by an assembly line worker , then you have a design document .
If it still requires creative human interpretation , then you do n’t .
In software development , the design document is a source code listing .

Connexion by Boeing , a business unit of The Boeing Company , and Intel have announced plans to promote high - speed , in - flight wireless Internet services , and say they have successfully finished compatibility tests with laptops that use Intel 's Centrino mobile technology .
Connexion by Boeing Wi-Fi service is available already on 70 airplanes and 100 daily routes worldwide on Lufthansa Airlines , Scandinavian Airlines , Japan Airlines , ANA , Singapore Airlines , and China Airlines .
Soon , Austrian Airlines , Korean Air , El Al , Asiana , and Etihad will begin offering the services on long - range aircraft .
Wi -Fi Copilots
The announcement marks the first time Intel and Connexion by Boeing have worked together on the in - flight Wi -Fi effort , and includes the addition of Intel 's Wireless Verification Program to the partnership .
Through that verification program , Intel works with wireless service providers to improve quality of service , having verified 103 service providers in 70,000 hotspots worldwide .
Connexion by Boeing spokesman Terrance Scott says Intel 's involvement will help ensure that air passengers have high - quality in - flight Wi -Fi service .
Connexion already has reached wireless roaming agreements with more than 600 corporations and 17 service providers as part of its efforts to build the in - flight service .
Travelers connect through an established account with Connexion by Boeing or use the roaming platforms of their existing wireless providers , typically paying $ 29.95 for unlimited access on an international flight , or $ 19.95 for access on flights lasting less than 6 hours .

Earth 's temperature has increased by about 1 degree Fahrenheit ( 0.56 degrees Celsius ) in the last century .
Most of the warming in the last 50 years is attributed to human activities , according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency .
Goldilocks and the Greenhouse What makes Earth habitable ?
This LiveScience original video explores the science of global warming and explains how , for now , conditions here are just right .
However , climate change has gone from being a scientific actuality to a political wedge issue , used as a cudgel by parties of all persuasions to point fingers and score points .
Consequently , many people , including scientists and politicians , ca n’t seem to arrive at agreement on the issue .
LiveScience recently reached out to several experts and visionaries for their views on this controversial topic and dug up published comments of others .
Here we present a spectrum of opinions and concerns ranging from the importance of climate change being " grossly exaggerated " to " If President Bush could jump in a time machine and experience a single day in 2056 , he 'd return to the present shocked and awed . "
Jim Hansen , director of NASA'S Goddard Institute for Space Studies , in an email interview :
" The argument about whether there is global warming is over .
It is now clear that , for thirty years , we have been in a strong global warming trend at a rate of about 0.2 Celsius per decade for the past 30 years , [ meaning ] there has been 1 degree Fahrenheit ( 0.56 degrees Celsius ) global warming in the past 30 years .
The Earth is now at its warmest level in the period of instrumental data , that is , since the late 1800s . "
Naomi Oreskes , associate professor of history and director of the Program in Science Studies at the University of California , San Diego in an editorial piece in The Washington Post in 2004 :
" Many people have the impression that there is significant scientific disagreement about global climate change .
It 's time to lay that misapprehension to rest .
There is a scientific consensus on the fact that Earth 's climate is heating up and human activities are part of the reason .
We need to stop repeating nonsense about the uncertainty of global warming and start talking seriously about the right approach to address it .
" The basic picture is clear , and some changes are already occurring .
A new report by the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment — a consortium of eight countries , including Russia and the United States — now confirms that major changes are taking place in the Arctic , affecting both human and non-human communities , as predicted by climate models . "
Christine Rogers , senior research scientist , Harvard School of Public Health , Harvard University , in an email interview :
" The impacts of the changes the climate scientists are predicting are being tested in a number of systems .
For plants , it seems that elevated levels of CO2 [ carbon dioxide ] will increase plant biomass , water use efficiency , and reproductive effort .
Some experiments have shown that this includes an increase in pollen production .
Since some plants have pollen that is highly allergenic , this could mean increased exposure to allergens and an increase in illness for those who are pollen allergic .
" It remains to be seen whether this increased exposure will also cause an increase in the number of people with allergic disease . "
Paul Epstein , associate director of the Center for Health and the Global Environment at Harvard Medical School , in an email interview :
" The most coherent explanation is that climate is changing because of burning of fossil fuels and felling forests .
The health , environmental , and economic costs of inaction are rapidly becoming unmanageable .
Stabilizing the climate will require a clean energy transition that will also benefit public health , improve energy security , and can become the engine of economic growth for this 21st century .
" We 're seeing changes in asthma , heat wave deaths , and the spread of infectious diseases that are indicative of enormous changes affecting the environment .
Climate and disease are stalking humans , wildlife , agriculture , forests , and marine habitat ; which are our life support systems . "
David Archer , professor in the Department of the Geophysical Sciences from the University of Chicago , in an email interview :
" The warming of the past several decades has been faster and risen to higher temperatures in the past decades than has been seen in thousands of years .
Rising CO2 [ carbon dioxide ] levels can easily explain the warming , but there is no alternative explanation that does not involve rising CO2 or predict further warming .
Scientists have done their job , it is time now to confront the reality of human - induced climate change resulting from emission of CO2 from fossil fuel consumption . "
Kurt M. Cuffey , professor of geography at the University of California in Berkeley , in an editorial for The San Francisco Chronicle in 2005 .
" When we look at the complex environmental systems of our planet , from climate to the polar ice sheets , there will always be lingering uncertainties , and some surprises probably await us .
But in the thorough and convincing rebuttal of the last contrary arguments , we have just witnessed a historically important validation of the scientific evidence for human causation of climate warming .
And Katrina and the waning polar ice caps remind us how important this is .
" It is time for remaining skeptics to look at the tear - streaked faces of refugees from New Orleans , as well as the startling map of ice shrinkage around the North Pole , and begin to plan for the future . "
(( ImgTag||right|null|null|null|false ) )
Patrick J. Michaels , professor of Natural Resources , Virginia Tech , State Climatologist for Virginia in an email interview :
" In climate science , we only have two things : data ( the past ) and models or hypotheses ( the future ) .
The data show us that distribution of warming since the mid-1970s is consistent with what one would expect from an enhanced carbon dioxide - related greenhouse effect .
The ensemble behavior of our models is that , once this warming is initiated , it tends to take place at a constant ( rather than an ever - increasing ) rate .
Indeed this has been the case for the last three decades .
" Consequently we know , with considerable confidence , the rate of warming for the policy - foreseeable future , and it is about 0.85 degrees Celsius , [ 1.53 degrees Fahrenheit ] per half - century .
This is near the low end of projections made by the United Nations .
However , there is no known suite of technologies that can affect this rate significantly , so the proper policy is to invest in the future rather than to waste money today in a futile attempt to significantly reduce warming . "
Daniel Gilbert , professor of psychology at Harvard University in Op - Ed section of The Los Angeles Times earlier this month :
" Because we barely notice changes that happen gradually , we accept gradual changes that we would reject if they happened abruptly .
" Environmentalists despair that global warming is happening so fast .
In fact , it is n't happening fast enough .
If President Bush could jump in a time machine and experience a single day in 2056 , he 'd return to the present shocked and awed , prepared to do anything it took to solve the problem .
" The human brain is a remarkable device that was designed to rise to special occasions .
We are the progeny of people who hunted and gathered , whose lives were brief and whose greatest threat was a man with a stick .
When terrorists attack , we respond with crushing force and firm resolve , just as our ancestors would have .
Global warming is a deadly threat precisely because it fails to trip the brain 's alarm , leaving us soundly asleep in a burning bed .
" It remains to be seen whether we can learn to rise to new occasions . "

I have played music in some of the sleaziest dives on the West Coast .
I am not joking .
I ’ve had a lunatic cowboy launch a full can of Pabst at my head because he thought I was singing about him .
( Remember “ Third Rate Romance , Low Rent Rendezvous ” ? )
I once had to conk a drunk with my Telecaster as he assaulted my bass player .
I ’ve strummed and sung while dancers slugged each other , puked up tequila , tried to have sex , and took advantage of an overflowing bar sink to play Slip n’ Slide across the floor ( breaking wrists and noses as they slammed into the far wall ) .
I got so good at playing in the middle of riots that , one night in a Virginia City basement bar , I caught a drunk with my right foot to keep him from falling into my mic stand , stood him up by putting my knee in his chest , and then drop - kicked him back into the crowd ... all without missing a beat or botching a chord on my guitar while I sang the chorus of “ Brown Sugar ” .
And you ask :
What the heck does any of this have to do with marketing ?
And I will tell you :
Learning to soothe the savage beast with music is n’t much different than using words to persuade him to buy .
You are dealing , in both cases , with ...
The Irrational Side
Of A Human Being .
For example : I discovered early on that , while making out a playlist for a gig , every blessed song must either :
( a ) make ‘em cry in their beer ... or ...
( b ) wanna shake their booty .
The only exceptions are boring weddings ( which I refuse to play ) , or touring with someone who has a hit record ( which I have never done -- my gigs have always been bars or dances ) .
That means , no matter how much the keyboard player wants to do soppy ballads , or how badly the chick singer wants to belt out Broadway hits ... you stick to tunes that pass the test .
If you play something slow , it better have the burly guy with the Harley tattoo wiping away a tear .
And no matter how fast a song is , it better be rigged with a vicious back beat that forces people to get up and dance .
Or you ’re gonna be playing for the pissed - off bartender and an empty room for the rest of the night .
How do I use this discovery while writing killer ad copy ?
Easy .
Great copy has a rhythm , a grace to it .
Essentially , it bops to an inner back beat .
So you never , ever use sentences that are n’t immediately and easily understood .
Or that interrupt the rhythm .
Your reader will not go back and re-read a sentence that baffles him .
He will simply move on to something else .
You gotta hook into your prospect ’s soul , and get him nodding his head .
Occasionally , I have written copy that is so right on , readers have shouted in glee as they raced through it .
I ’ve seen it .
Every fiber of their being wakes up , and a “ bliss dump ” of urgent need and genuine excitement takes over .
Much like a kick - ass rendition of “ Rollin ’ And Tumblin ’ ” can ignite a room full of lonely secretaries and uptight executives and get ‘em dancing on the tables and throwing ties and bras into the chandeliers .
( Yeah , I ’ve seen that , too . )
Or ... if you ’re solving a problem that saves your prospect from a life in Hell , you do n’t want to dick around with even a sliver of copy that is n’t riveted to the humanity of what he ’s feeling .
You ’re both crying in your beer , but not because it ’s hopeless ... rather , you ’re purging the wound , and offering hope and a better life where before there was only despair .
Why does one band starve , while another has people begging them to play lavishly - funded gigs every weekend ?
You gotta lay into your audience with exactly what they need and want -- even if they are n’t clear on what it is they really crave .
This requires you to be a little ahead of your market , and a little smarter .
I ca n’t tell you how many times drunks have pleaded for “ Free Bird ” by Lynyrd Skynyrd .
Heck , I ’ve had guys threaten me when I refused .
But you ca n’t play it .
It ’s a long , hard - to - pulloff song that gets a few die - hards excited , but loses the rest of the crowd .
And you ’re up there , looking silly for 12 minutes while the call for taxis becomes a din .
Same with your target market .
You listen to no one but the numbers and your gut instinct ( if you have a gut that has proven itself already ) .
No matter how much your partners , your wife , or your lawyer insist that you to do something ... if it ’s not gonna spur sales , then you do n’t do it .

Farm aid plumps up Iraq funding
Democrats insert $ 3.7B that 's unrelated to war
WASHINGTON —
Three months after promising to curtail spending on pet legislative projects , House Democrats have salted the Iraq emergency spending bill with $ 3.7 billion for farm interests that make significant donations to Democrats .
Rep. Sanford Bishop , a Georgia Democrat who refers to himself as " the peanut congressman , " makes no apologies for helping to put $ 74 million into the spending bill to cover storage fees for peanut growers .
He says he would have backed the measure even if peanut interests had n't contributed $ 35,750 to last year 's race , according to a USA TODAY analysis of PoliticalMoneyLine 's contribution database .
" That 's what politics is : Who gets what , when and how , " said Bishop , an Appropriations Committee member .
Rep. Jerry Lewis of California , the ranking GOP member on the committee , and other Republicans have charged that the provisions are tailored to attract support from moderate Democrats for language requiring troops to be out of Iraq by fall 2008 .
Rep. David Obey , D - Wis. , the committee chairman , said the money is mostly for disaster relief , which had been left undone by Republicans .
" Every time there is a disaster on the farming front , the federal government provides assistance , " Obey said .
" This is no different than what 's been done for the last 50 years . "
The $ 124 billion bill — which will be debated today and scheduled for a vote Friday — also includes :
•$ 25 million for spinach growers to offset losses from last fall 's E. coli contamination .
The chief backer is Rep. Sam Farr , D - Calif. , an Appropriations Committee member from the spinach - rich Salinas Valley .
His last campaign received $ 30,600 from spinach interests , according to the Center for Responsive Politics .
•$ 252 million for milk subsidies , inserted by Obey , who has raised $ 113,000 from dairy interests since 1989 , including at least $ 9,000 last cycle , Center figures show .
Obey said those donations played no role in his actions .
" I represent dairy farmers .
You got a problem with that ? "
•$ 3.3 billion for crop and livestock losses owing to drought , flooding and other natural disasters .
Crop and livestock farmers gave $ 6.6 million to Democrats in the last campaign cycle , according to the Center .
Bishop and Farr say they support the Iraq language regardless of the farm funding .
Last year , the Republican - controlled Congress added $ 4 billion in farm aid to a $ 97 billion emergency Iraq bill , but the Bush administration negotiated to cut the farm aid to $ 400 million .
The National Security Council sent a stern three - page warning to all the country ’s newspaper editors detailing banned topics , including the rise in gasoline prices or other economic woes like possible new international sanctions , negotiations with the United States over the future of Iraq , civil society movements and the Iranian - American arrests .
The entire campaign is “ a strong message by Ahmadinejad ’s government , security and intelligence forces that they are in control of the domestic situation , ” said Hadi Ghaemi , an Iran analyst for Human Rights Watch .
“ But it ’s really a sign of weakness and insecurity . ”
At least three prominent nongovernment organizations that pushed for broader legal rights or civil society have been shuttered outright , while hundreds more have been forced underground .
A recent article on the Baztab Web site said that about 8,000 nongovernment organizations were in jeopardy , forced to prove their innocence , basically because the government suspects all of them of being potential conduits for some $ 75 million the United States has earmarked to promote a change in government .
Professors have been warned against attending overseas conferences or having any contact with foreign governments , lest they be recruited as spies .
The Iranian - Americans are all being detained basically on the grounds that they were either recruiting or somehow abetting an American attempt to achieve a “ velvet revolution ” in Iran .
Analysts trace the broadening crackdown to a March speech by Ayatollah Khamenei , whose pronouncements carry the weight of law .
He warned that no one should damage national unity when the West was waging psychological war on Iran .
The country has been under fire , particularly from the United States , which accuses it of trying to develop nuclear weapons and fomenting violence in Iraq .
President Ahmadinejad and other senior officials have dismissed all the criticism as carping .
The president blames the previous administration for inflation or calls it media exaggeration , while Tehran ’s chief prosecutor , Said Mortazavi , said Iranians who oppose the Islamic Republic look for an excuse to criticize it .
After a meeting of senior police and judiciary officials in Tehran on June 19 to review what was described as “ the public security drive , ” the Iranian Labor News Agency quoted Mr. Mortazavi as saying that if the state did not protect public security , then “ louts ” and criminals “ would be safe in society .
Embryo research will be controlled
When the ban was proposed last year there were fears among scientists it would hamper medical breakthroughs .
Hybrid embryos will only be allowed for research into serious disease and scientists will require a licence .
Scientists welcomed the proposals put forward in the draft fertility bill , but opponents questioned the ethics of using human cells in this way .
Hybrids
Public Health Minister Caroline Flint denied that the government had staged a climbdown , saying they had always wanted to " leave the door open " for this type of research to be allowed on a case - by - case basis .
She said scientists had put forward more evidence about the importance of using hybrid embryos .
We saw this was an area where these could be used for scientific benefit
Public Health Minister Caroline Flint
" We saw this was an area where these could be used for scientific benefit . "
The draft bill allows the creation of human embryos that have been physically mixed with one or more animal cells .
However , true human - animal hybrids , made by the fusion of sperm and eggs , remain outlawed .
And in all cases it would be illegal to allow embryos to grow for more than 14 days or be implanted into a womb .
Scientists say their work could help find cures for devastating diseases , such as Alzheimer's .
Professor Robin Lovell - Badge , head of the division of Developmental Genetics at the MRC National Institute for Medical Research , said : " This research has many potential benefits for the understanding of disease and for treatments and should not be feared . "
PROPOSALS
' Need for the father ' removed Welfare of the child checks retained Sex- selection for non-medical reasons banned Statutory storage period for embryos extended from five to 10 years Donors informed if their child is seeking identifying information about them Parenthood provisions for civil partners and other same - sex couples Screening embryos for serious medical conditions and as a suitable tissue match permitted Deliberately screening - in a disease or disorder , such as if two deaf parents wished to have a deaf child , banned Up to a year ' cooling off ' period if consent to embryo storage by one of the couple involved is withdrawn Donor - conceived children allowed to find out if they have sisters or brothers also conceived through donation , when they reach 18
But Josephine Quintavalle , of the campaign group Comment on Reproductive Ethics , disagreed , saying : " It is appalling that the government has bowed to pressure from the random collection of self - interested scientists and change its prohibitive stance .
" This is a highly controversial and terrifying proposal , which has little justification in science and even less in ethics .
" Endorsement by the UK government will elicit horror in Europe and right across the wider world . "
The government signalled its intentions in December 's White Paper , which contained 25 proposals to overhaul the current laws .
Ministers felt the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 needed to be updated as science has moved on significantly .
The draft bill also proposes scrapping the requirement for clinics to consider the need for a father when deciding on treatment .
This means clinics will no longer be able to deny treatment to lesbians and single mothers out of hand .
Another proposal is to merge the regulatory bodies the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority and the Human Tissue Authority to form a single regulatory body called RATE .
The British Medical Association , however , believes this is a bad idea .
It says the complex and sensitive issues that surround reproduction and embryo research are very different from those relating to the retention and use of organs and tissues after death and , therefore , would be too much for one new body to oversee .
Maybe I 'm just getting old or I 'm just utterly incompetent when it comes to typing on cell phones , but I just can't text message people .
The phone always guesses the wrong word or I have to keep going back to fix something , the buttons are tiny , basically typing on them is a horrible experience .
I find it even more insane that I 'm typing on a phone to begin with , something that I could use to actually speak with someone .
Well since everyone insists on texting me anyways , I need a real keyboard .
I need the G - Tech - Smart Fabric Roll - Up Bluetooth Keyboard .
Simply unroll this ultra thin fabric keyboard and it connects to your cell phone wirelessly via bluetooth and you 're good to go .
I still hate cell phones .

BBC News defence correspondent , Dhi Qhar
Dhi Qar , in the British sector , was among the first Iraqi provinces to assume control of its own security .
Its police chief tells the BBC one third of his officers are linked to illegal militias .
The British want Dhi Qar to be a model for change in Basra
" You must get away from Basra , " said the British army .
" The view you get there is too negative .
We 'll take you to Muthana or Dhi Qar - those are the real success stories . "
Dhi Qar and its neighbour Muthana were the first two provinces to get control of their own security from the British , last year .
They are held up as a model of how things should work in Basra .
After arriving at the main base in Dhi Qar , Col Ed Brown - of the newly - formed Rifles Regiment - took us to the police headquarters in Dhi Qar 's capital , Nasiriyah .
Once at the police station , senior officers boasted of the low murder rate - less than 30 a month and mostly tribal killings .
They looked forward to new business investment in the province , even tourists .
Sons killed
This was the good news story in Dhi Qar the Army was so anxious for us to see .
But after listening to half an hour of this , Brig Gen Ghalib al Jaza 'aere could contain himself no longer .
The militias , they are all ex-criminals , now you will find that these people are carrying out torture exactly as Saddam used to do
Brig Gen Ghalib al Jaza'aere
A gaunt figure , once imprisoned under Saddam , the general is now the Ministry of Interior official in overall charge of Dhi Qar and Muthana .
More recently , two of his sons were killed by the militias .
He was in no mood for public relations .
At 0430 that morning , he said , the Mehdi militia had attacked the main police station in neighbouring Muthana with rocket - propelled grenades .
Minutes earlier , those guarding the station had mysteriously disappeared .
Some police officers had apparently colluded in the attack on their own station .
Political protection
The police chief for Dhi Qar , Gen Abdul Hussein Al Saffe , was also in the room .
I asked him how many of his own men he could n't trust because they were linked to the illegal militias .
" One third , " he said , adding that they had political protection and he could not sack them .
The other general - the one who has lost two sons - was now angrily gesticulating .
They had been forced , for tribal or political reasons , to hire 300 to 400 officers who were completely illiterate , he said .
" In Saddam 's time , you might have to take a corporal or a sergeant who could n't read or write if they had connections , " he said .
" But now it is colonels , even a brigadier , and there is nothing we can do . "
The stories came pouring out .
A drug smuggler captured and sent to Baghdad but taken to a mental hospital for " treatment " lasting a couple of days then freed ; a double murderer sentenced to death then mysteriously allowed out of jail ; a police officer caught smuggling weapons to be used against British troops .
They sacked that officer , they said , but he was reinstated and even promoted by Baghdad .
Iraqi problems
All of this is a reflection of the fact that the Iraqi government is kept in power by political parties who each have a paramilitary wing .
Things are imperfect but we make a huge mistake ... if we try and turn this into Surrey
Col Ed Brown
A more immediate problem for these two senior officers is that , since January , they have received none of their budget from Baghdad .
Wages are paid , but there is no money for fuel , vehicles , equipment or weapons .
Col Brown told me afterwards : " What we must do as coalition forces is to give as much support as we can without actually taking back the responsibility for security because it is very clearly theirs . "
He went on : " Things are imperfect but we make a huge mistake , and we will move down a road that will end in real failure , if we try and turn this into Surrey .
It is n't .
" There is a level of violence here - but that is life in Iraq .
It 's been like this for thousands of years .
It 's not going to change . "
The hope now of the British high command , according to one senior officer , is to " tip - toe away from southern Iraq " leaving behind some kind of security structure which will survive .
British officers recognise that militia infiltration , torture in police stations , and illiterate but untouchable officers are all serious problems .
But these are now viewed as Iraqi problems , for the Iraqis alone to solve .

Lazy Dynamic - Programming can be Eager .
L. Allison ,
Department of Computer Science ,
Monash University ,
Australia 3168 .
December 1991 , Revised May 1992
Abstract .
Lazy - evaluation in a functional language is exploited to make the simple dynamic - programming algorithm for the edit - distance problem run quickly on similar strings : being lazy can be fast .
Keywords : dynamic - programming , edit - distance , functional programming , lazy evaluation .
1. Introduction
The edit - distance problem [ $ Sell ] is to find the minimum number of point - mutations , D A B , required to edit one given string A into another given string B . A point - mutation is one of the following : change a letter , insert a letter , or delete a letter .
Sometimes one also wants to find a minimal set of mutations that edits A into B .
The problem , and variations on it , are important in Molecular - Biology for comparing linear macro- molecules for similarity [ $ Sank ] [ $ Bish ] .
It also arises in spelling correction , file comparison and other " computing " problems [ $ Wagn ] .
It is closely related to the longest - common - subsequence problem .
There is a large body of work in the computing and biological literature on algorithms , in imperative languages , for the edit - distance problem and its relatives .
This paper discusses solving the edit - distance problem in a lazy functional language [ $ Peyt ] .
It begins with a simple but inefficient algorithm .
Removing the cause of the inefficiency leads to a functional version of the well - known ( imperative ) dynamic - programming algorithm ( DPA ) [ $ Sell ] [ $ Wagn ] , which has O ( |A | * | B| ) time and space - complexity .
A simple modification of this second algorithm and an obvious observation lead to an O ( |A | * ( 1+D A B ) ) algorithm .
This is fast for the important special case of similar strings .
It exploits lazy - evaluation to gain its speed .
It is as simple as the basic DPA but , thanks to lazy - evaluation , effectively implements an eager or greedy strategy [ $ Mill ] [ $ Myer ] which requires added complication when written in an imperative language .
This may give hope to the less energetic among us : being lazy can be fast .
A = acgtacgtacgt B = acatacttgtact A = acgtac gtacgt || ||| | ||| | B = acatacttgtac t ^ ^^ ^ | || | | || delete | || | insert * 2 | change D A B = 4 An Example .
Given strings
A and B , a natural way to begin to compute D A B is to compare their first letters , hd A and hd B .
( Equivalently , a start can be made with the last letters . )
If they are equal , no mutation is required here , so the edit - distance of the remainder of the strings , As=tl A and Bs=tl B , is computed .
If they are not equal a mutation is required and there are three possibilities : ( i ) hd A can be changed into hd B and As edited into Bs , ( ii ) hd A can be deleted and As edited into B , or ( iii ) hd B can be inserted and A edited into Bs .
The least costly alternative is chosen .
If either string is null , the edit - distance is the length of the other string .
This leads to the first algorithm :
D []
B = length B || { A is null} D A [ ] = length A || { B is null} D A B = let As=tl A , Bs=tl B in if hd A = hd B then D As Bs else 1 + min3 ( D As Bs ) ( D As B ) ( D A Bs ) Algorithm 1 : Inefficient .
This and other algorithms are written in lazy ML ( LML ) [ $ Augu ] .
Note that `|| ' separates cases in the definition of a function and that `[ ] ' denotes the empty list or string .
If A=B , the algorithm runs in O ( |A| ) time , checking equality one character at a time , and it is clearly impossible to do better .
However , the worst - case complexity is exponential in the length of the strings , as the function is triply - recursive ; consider A=aaa ... and B=bbb ... .
The cause of the inefficiency is that intermediate results are calculated more than once .
For example , D As Bs can be calculated three times .
In such cases , the intermediate results should be calculated once and stored in a data - structure for re-use .
2. An O ( |A | * |B| ) Algorithm
A data - structure is used to remove the source of inefficiency in the previous algorithm .
It holds intermediate results D A [ 1..i ] B [ 1..j ] , i, j>=0 .
From the previous section we know the following equations :
D A[ 1..i ] " " = i , i>=0 D " " B [ 1..j ] = j , j>=0 if i>0 & j>0 : D A [ 1..i ] B [ 1..j ] = D A [ 1..i - 1 ] B [ 1.. j - 1 ] , if A [ i ] = B[j ] = 1 + min(( D A [ 1..i-1 ] B [ 1.. j - 1 ] ) , ( D A [ 1..i - 1 ] B [ 1..j ] ) , ( D A [ 1..i ] B [ 1.. j - 1 ] ) ) otherwise Useful Equations .
These equations form the basis of the well - known dynamic - programming algorithm ( DPA ) for the edit - distance problem [ $ Sell ] .
A matrix , Dmatrix [ i , j ] , would be used to hold D A [ 1..i ] B [ 1..j ] , i>=0 , j > =0 , in an imperative language :
a c a t ... -> B 0 1 2 3 4 ... a : 1 0 1 2 3 ... c : 2 1 0 1 2 ... g : 3 2 1 1 2 ... t : 4 3 2 2 1 ... . .... | v A Dmatrix .
A list of rows can be used in a functional program , each row being a list of ints .
It can be seen that a row can be calculated from left to right , given the previous row .
An element depends only on the elements to the west , north - west and north .
This leads to the following functional version :
D A B = let rec Rows = [ 0 .. length B ] { the first row } .
( EachRow A ( hd Rows ) ) { the other rows} and EachRow [ ] lastrow = [ ] || EachRow ( Ach. As ) lastrow = let rec DoRow [ ] NWs W = [ ] || { NW N } DoRow ( Bch. Bs ) ( NW.N ) W = { W me} let me = if Ach = Bch then NW else 1 + min3 W NW ( hd N ) { NB .
N is a list} in me .
( DoRow Bs N me ) and firstelt = 1 + hd lastrow and thisrow = firstelt .
( DoRow B lastrow firstelt ) in thisrow .
( EachRow ( tl A ) thisrow ) in last ( last Rows ) Algorithm 2 : O ( |A | * |B| ) .
Note that `.' is the list constructor , also known as `cons ' .
A lazy functional language , such as LML [ $ Augu ] , is needed to run this algorithm .
Function DoRow calculates one row , except for the first element .
A row is recursively defined , the current element `me ' depending on the previous element , to the west , W . Me becomes the previous element for next element .
The current element also depends on two elements in the previous row , to the north - west and the north , NW and hd N .
Note that N is a list beginning with the northern element .
This is an example of a circular program [ $ Bird ] [ $ Alli ] , using a recursively defined data - structure .
It runs in O ( |A | * | B| ) time and space .
This is both its best - case and its worst - case complexity , so while a lot has been gained in the general case , compared with algorithm 1 , something has been lost for the particular case of identical strings .
3. An O ( |A | *( 1+D A B ) ) Algorithm
The previous algorithm used a list of rows to store intermediate results .
If one thinks of the values as " heights " in a contour - map , they represent a valley climbing from 0=D " " " " in the north - west to a height of D A B in the south - east , with a peak D " " B to the north - east and another peak D A " " to the south - west .
D A B is the maximum height of the valley floor in the south - east .
We are not interested in the peaks .
This suggests reorganising the data - structure as diagonals ; apart from that the data - structure contains the same values as before .
An entry still depends on three neighbours which lie on the diagonal below , the current diagonal and the diagonal above .
Each diagonal therefore depends on the diagonal below and the diagonal above where a row depends only on the row above .
The code needs a little modification to accommodate this :
D A B = let rec and MainDiag = OneDiag A B ( hd Uppers ) ( - 1 . ( hd Lowers ) ) and Uppers = EachDiag A B ( MainDiag.
Uppers ) {upper diagonals} and Lowers = EachDiag B A ( MainDiag.
Lowers ) {lower diagonals} {note swap B A !} and OneDiag A B diagAbove diagBelow = let rec DoDiag [ ] B NW N W = [ ] || DoDiag A [ ] NW N W = [ ] || DoDiag ( Ach. As ) ( Bch. Bs ) NW N W = let me = if Ach =
Bch then NW else 1 + min3 ( hd W ) NW ( hd N ) {see below} in me .
( DoDiag As Bs me ( tl N ) ( tl W ) ) {along diag} {hope these ^^^^ ^^^^ not evaluated} and firstelt = 1 + hd diagBelow and thisdiag = firstelt .
( DoDiag A B firstelt diagAbove ( tl diagBelow ) ) in thisdiag and EachDiag A [ ]
Diags = [ ] || EachDiag A ( Bch. Bs ) ( LastDiag. Diags ) = let NextDiag = hd ( tl Diags ) in ( OneDiag A Bs NextDiag LastDiag ) {one diag &} .
( EachDiag A Bs Diags ) { the others} and LAB = ( length A ) - ( length B ) in last ( if LAB=0 then MainDiag else if LAB>0 then select LAB Lowers else { LAB < 0} select ( - LAB ) Uppers ) Algorithm 3 : O ( |A | * ( 1+D A B ) ) .
The algorithm defines all ( |A|+1 ) * ( | B|+1 ) entries in all diagonals but they are not necessarily all evaluated .
It prints the last entry in the appropriate , LAB = |A| - |B| , diagonal .
The worst - case complexity is O ( |A | * | B| ) as before , eg. when A=aaa ... and B=bbb ... .
However , if A=B the complexity is now O ( |A| ) because only the main diagonal is evaluated .
What happens in other cases crucially depends on the definition of min3 .
A standard implementation of min3 is as follows :
{standard} min3 X Y Z = min X ( min Y Z )
This requires all three of X , Y and Z to be evaluated .
The reason that min3 is called is that a run of matches has come to an end and a change may be needed on the diagonal .
Given the above definition of min3 , if A and B are unequal but similar , the complexity is still O ( |A | * |B| ) ; consider A=cc...cca and B=cc...ccb .
Because the last characters differ , min3 is called and all of the upper and lower triangular areas of the data structure are evaluated to calculate X and Z .
A little thought reveals that if X < Y in our situation then Z>=X , so there is no need for min3 to evaluate Z in that case .
A better coding of min3 for our purposes is :
{special} min3 X Y Z = if X < Y then X else min Y Z
Now Z is only evaluated if X >=Y .
The new min3 is biased to examine elements closer to the main diagonal , ie .
X and Y , in preference to the the one further from it , Z .
This is a good thing because it means that diagonals are only evaluated up to a " height " of D A B .
Only parts of at most 1+2*D A B central diagonals are evaluated at all .
This algorithm therefore runs in O ( |A | * ( 1+D A B ) ) time and space .
eg. Only 3 diagonals are evaluated if A=cc...cca and B=cc...ccb .
Note that it is important to compare X and Y first , and to try to avoid evaluating Z , in order to gain the efficiency .
A similar technique can also be used in the first two algorithms where it brings a small improvement but does not change their underlying complexities .
The algorithms were coded in lambda - calculus and run on an instrumented interpreter , and also coded in LML and timed to confirm their expected behaviour .
A = acgtacgtac ...
B mutated from A by point mutations , change : insert : delete in ratio 2:1:1 , uniformly spread through length of string .
length = | A| = | B| 0 10 20 -> D A B length ----------------
1000 : 0.11 0.72 1.47 CPU time ( secs ) 2000 : 0.29 1.59 3.17 for 4000 : 0.62 3.42 6.35 LML , Dec -5000 / 125 Using special min3 0 10 20 -> D A B length ----------------
1000 0.12 30 30 2000 0.28 112 130 CPU time ( secs ) 4000 0.62 524 491 Using standard min3 Sample Timing Results for Algorithm 3 .
Although it is lazy and driven by the demand to print the last entry of the LAB diagonal , algorithm 3 evaluates just the entries that an eager , imperative algorithm does [ $ Mill ] .
Briefly , the latter tries to " push " along the LAB diagonal from the north - west to the south - east for as far as it can with a run of matches .
If the run terminates in a change , it pushes the two neighbouring diagonals to the end of a run .
This gives enough information to advance the LAB diagonal to the next " height " and so on .
This strategy requires major changes from the simple DPA in an imperative language .
It all happens automatically in the final lazy functional DPA .
If a minimal set of mutations to edit A into B is needed , they can be recovered by tracing back from the south - east of the data - structure to the north - west following the chain of dependencies selected by min3 .
Further reflection can reveal that because each diagonal is monotonic increasing , a " dual " data - structure which stores the positions of contours in the previous data - structure can be used .
However , this requires major surgery on the algorithm .
It leads to a functional version of Ukkonen 's algorithm [ $ Ukko ] , having the same time - complexity as above but O ( ( D A B ) 2 ) space - complexity for the data - structure .

Part I
Several years ago word got round that the US government was going to put an RFID chip into a passport .
Privacy advocates rallied and ranted about the insecurity of the technology , the lack of standards , the foibles of technological advance , and the massive infrastructure expenses required to build a system to support an RFID passport , and pronounced the idea Dead On Arrival .
Congratulations are due to those intrepid folks , because their voices were heard , their concerns noted , and the International Civil Aviation Organization ( ICAO ) returned to the drawing board and has now issued specifications for an RFID - enabled biometric passport that focuses on the technical concerns and addresses them quite handily .
The concept remains intact and is now much stronger for the technical tests it was subjected to , rather than weaker for its violations of human rights principles .
I found myself with the opportunity to dig deep into the issue directly from the horse ’s mouth , so to speak , and if you ’re interested , I ’ll tell you all about it .
First , the players :
ICAO – International Civil Aviation Organization .
This is , for lack of a better reference , the United Nations Air Travel Overlord .
It is a multi-national , transnational organization that sets the standards and rules by which international flights are conducted .
One of their top mission priorities is to regulate border crossings by airplane .
As such , they have taken on the task of developing the standards which all nations will adhere to when sending or receiving international passengers on flights across their respective borders .
This scope has been expanded to the entire design of specifications for passports worldwide .
Interpol – International Criminal Police Organization .
If you were n’t aware , this is an international police force that focuses on crimes that cross borders , specifically terrorism , human trafficking , and smuggling , among others .
They have been very busy bees , setting up the I - 24/7 global network of databases which governments and police agencies are using to track criminals internationally .
IATA – International Aviation Travel Association .
A trade alliance of airlines that regulates everything from what seats will be available on a plane to the price - fixing rules airlines must adhere to when selling you a ticket .
In our story , they are one of the victims , though I would hardly call this enemy of my enemy a friend .
They are desperate to get in on the whole scheme in order to get their piece of the power - pie and feel more than a little snubbed that they were n’t invited to the party earlier .
ISO – International Standards Organization .
If you ’re into computers , you ’ve heard this acronym thrown around .
This is the organization that decides technical specifications for all technologies .
If you ’ve ever heard the term , “ ISO standard , ” this is who they are talking about .
In this case , they set the base standards of the RFID chip that is being embedded into passports .
Our story actually starts some 30 years ago , when ICAO first recommended that passports have a Machine Readable Zone ( MRZ ) at the bottom of the data page .
The bit in red is the machine readable zone .
Probably 90 % of today ’s passports have this , and it ’s not a big deal , really .
It ’s just a way for a scanner to read the same data on the front of the passport and push it into a computer screen with a wee bit of check - digits to verify on .
But it set the stage for the universalization of the passport internationally .
Today , ICAO has revealed its mandated specifications for the new generation of passports .
But why does ICAO feel the need for a new passport ?
Their justifications are quite simple and obvious .
1. Terrorism
2. International Crime
3. Holistic Transnational Identity Integrity
Holista - what ?
Yeah , that ’s the one they snuck in there and it ’s a fun , fun phrase .
Holistic , as in broadly viewed , all encompassing , well - rounded .
Transnational as in global , not limited to national borders .
Identity integrity , as in verifying that you really are who someone thinks you should be .
If you ’re worried about National Id or Real Id , baby , you got another thing coming .
So what they want , right there , is the ability to identify any traveler by any number of means , from any angle , in any country , with as much absolute certainty as can be had ; and not a negative identification , as in , “ Whoever you are , you ’re not Osama . ”
But positive identification , “ You are not Osama .
You are Joe Paxer . ”
Positive identification , worldwide , at any time , by all governments , even ones that wo n’t claim you .
But there are obvious problems with trying to identify all the traveling citizens of all the governments in all the countries in the world .
All these governments have different databases , some do n’t have any databases of the citizens at all , and if they do , they are in different formats with different purposes and different abilities .
The logistics of trying to interconnect 189 governments ’ databases quickly escalates well beyond the realm of “ nightmare ” into some kind of Lovecraftian singularity of technological horror .
Enter Interpol , stage right .
The I - 24/7 network constructed by Interpol is more than just network .
It is in its third year of operation and they ’ve got the bugs worked out .
There are several databases behind the I - 24/7 network , of which 189 countries including the United States are members of and are connected to .
I ’ll just list a few :
· NCB – a database of criminal data currently containing the information on over 170,000 international criminals , including their biometric data such as fingerprints , iris scans , and photographs .
· SLTD – a database tracking lost and stolen passports around the globe .
Countries that have blank passports stolen can register them here , and whenever they pop up again , Interpol can track them .
· DNA – a database of individuals , not necessarily criminal that I ’m aware of , that contains DNA records .
Thirty - six nations currently routinely submit DNA records to this database .
Yup , a global DNA database .
· ICAID – International Child Abuse Image Database .
Images of abused children are stored here for the purposes of identifying them and prosecuting their tormentors .
Interestingly , all governments are connected to these databases , except Somalia .
Of all the countries , the U.S. is the least connected .
It has Interpol stations at only two entry points in the US -- the border of Mexico and Texas , and in New York .
I presume that many national border police and Customs offices simply connect to those stations for Interpol access instead of directly to the Interpol I - 24/7 network .
But Interpol is more than just an international police force or a police networking agency .
They have the ability to request that an identity ( remember , you are n’t a person , you are a holistic , transnational identity ) be denied international travel by simply making the request to the UN .
That request is propagated out to the member countries , who are obliged to comply and detain whoever matches that identity they can find and turn them over to Interpol .
So Interpol and the UN are in bed together , and ICAO is a branch of the UN responsible for determining passport specifications .
A passport that is universally similar can be universally added to a single database , even if that passport contains biometrics , and Interpol has a global network of databases already in operation .
Nice convergence , do n’t you think ?
Now , this is no conspiracy .
None of this is secret stuff and Interpol really is interested in catching criminals and beating up child molesters and ICAO really is interested in giving people better methods to guarantee they are who they say they are .
There is no “ We ’re gonna get the peasants now ! ” mentality .
The problem is not insidious intent , but typical scope creep and a basic assumption that differs from those of us in the freedom movement .
That scope creep is nothing more than , “ Let ’s try this one more thing , ” over and over again .
And the assumption is , quite simply , that we , the peasants , can and should trust them and all of their actions implicitly .
There are lots of discussions on privacy of the passport holders , but always privacy between me and you .
Not once do they mention privacy from the government or the police forces .
It simply does n’t enter their minds .
The concept is as alien as a revolution without dancing .
This is not to excuse any of their actions .
On the contrary , pointing out that they do not have evil intentions only emphasizes what the road to hell is actually paved with .
And let there be no mistake , this road is indeed paved .
Not planned , not under discussion , paved .
It ’s a done deal .
The e-Passport specification is law .
You never got to vote on it .
There were no legislators to petition .
No letters to write .
No recourse other than a newspaper , if they would even bother with such dry material .
ICAO is not an elected organization , and they developed their mandate with only the input they specifically sought .
They are not beholden to whatever government claims you , rather that government is beholden to them .
That is why I called them a transnational organization , as their authority exceeds the nations that are a part of it .
So while we were complaining about Real ID , and National ID , and Piggly - Wiggly Grocery store cards , ICAO simply took the entire debate out of the public view and made it happen .
E - Passports , passports with an embedded RFID chip are here and they are here to stay .
As of the end of 2006 , 16 nations including the United States will be issuing the e-Passport according to ICAO specifications .
Another 43 nations will be compliant by the end of 2007 .
And by 2010 , all 189 member nations are required to be compliant .
Today , right now , as you are reading this , there are already more than 50 million e-Passports in circulation , and most people who have them do n’t even know it .
It seems that ICAO wanted to avoid the much maligned “ RFID ” stigma , so they dropped it from open discussion , changed the name , and the entire thing slipped beneath the radar .
So much so that , when they had a trial run of the technology at LAX , folks carrying e-Passports did n’t get into the express e-Passport lines , because they did n’t know what they were carrying , or what the symbol on their passport meant .
ICAO has since tasked their PR department to promote and education the public on their e-Passports .
The e-Passport symbol and its suggested location on international passports .
If you want a non-chipped passport , you ’d better get it now .
2010 may seem like a long way off , but the countries that struggle to meet that deadline are the same ones that struggle for things like food and water .
Germany has already fully implemented the e-Passport .
Most of the European Union members are geared up for it as we speak and will have it in 2007 .
As I mentioned earlier , the US is already issuing them .
Every day that passes increases your chances of getting a chip in your passport .
And even if you do get one without a chip , all you ’ve done is buy some time .
Many of the countries are scaling back the validity of their passports to five years instead of the more common ten .
What this means is that by 2020 , every legal international traveler will have an e-Passport , as all the non-chipped passports in the world will have expired by then .
Many travelers will have had three passport issuances or renewals by then , one every five years .
The e-Passport is here and it ’s here to stay .
Does n’t bother you ?
You do n’t travel internationally ?
Pay attention .
Interpol and ICAO both have openly stated that e-Passport is the first step , not the last .
Airports are a convergence of security issues as you have people , property , airplanes , airports , and national and international borders all sardined into little aluminum tubes on air .
Of course that ’s the priority .
Of course air travel is the focus today .
But the specification for biometrics and the RFID chip structure has been specifically designed to be suitable for use in all travel documents , National IDs , and social service IDs .
Indeed , the passport specification itself allows the issuing country flexibility to include any additional functionality they want , including additional biometrics , cross references to social service records such as Social Security , or even allowing the bearer to add in his loyalty shopping cards and bank accounts , if the country allows it .
All of it tied directly to your biometric data and uploaded to national and international databases for tracking .
Fully implemented , the ICAO specification could be used to secure identity not only at airports , but land and water borders , concerts , sports events , critical infrastructure and industry , and even your local shopping mall .
Cameras recording your every public move are passé , last year ’s news .
The problem with camera recordings is that there are n’t enough people to watch them .
And that brings us to the brilliantly logical and effective piece of the ICAO specifications for biometric RFID passports , facial recognition biometrics .
Stay tuned !
Picture of the Swedish e-Passport and chipped National ID .
Part II
In Part I , I covered the basic premise of the e-Passport .
The International Civil Aviation Organization and Interpol have collaborated to create a universally accepted and trackable passport with biometrics stored in the RFID chip embedded into the passport .
Fifty million e-Passports are already in circulation , and most people do n’t know they have them .
The US is already issuing them .
Most of the EU will be issuing them next year .
And by 2010 , all 189 member nations will be issuing e-Passports to international travelers .
In this part , we cover the biometrics in the passport , a digital photo of your face .
Facial Recognition
Two years ago the community was up in arms over the idea that a chip in a passport would contain an iris pattern or a retina pattern or even a DNA pattern for anyone to scan .
And then that faded out and it appeared to be scaled back to a simple digital version of the photograph of the bearer stored in it .
And that is exactly true .
Does n’t seem insidious at all , really .
But there are reasons , very good reasons , why there is a photo instead of a fingerprint or an iris scan in the chip data .
And that ’s because your face is a biometric .
Not only is it a biometric , it is the universal biometric standard of the human race .
Every day you yourself use facial recognition to identify people .
You do n’t need a computer , special training or even working eyeballs ( ask a blind person to identify you by touch ) .
Facial recognition technology has quietly matured to the point where software can scan live video feeds in real - time , find faces in the video stream , capture them , and match them against photographs in databases in merely a few seconds .
I was shown a demonstration where software was real - time scanning and matching multiple people walking across a lobby .
A large LCD display showed the video stream with little red boxes zooming in on heads , freezing good frames whenever the software detected a face turned towards the camera , and a second computer monitor was matching up to six faces simultaneously to a database of photographs .
I matched someone in their test database at 54 % .
A low match , for certain , but if the tolerance is turned up to 80 % , agents have a reliable method of determining if you look close enough to a wanted person to be stopped for questioning .
The company doing this demonstration told me they recently implemented the system at the 2006 US Open Golf Tournament , where their camera scanned crowds and incoming fans ’ faces and matched them against criminal watch lists .
They had probable matches on 23 people , and ended up refusing entry to three of them .
Their software is production worthy , not a beta - test or a concept or a trial run .
Write them a check , and they ’ll plug it in for you wherever you like .
They even had some great suggestions for capturing close up images for even better profiling , such has hiding cameras at eye level behind seductive advertising .
Even a quick glance up to the boobs in your face gets your head framed perfectly for capture and matching to the photographic databases .
No problem , you say .
You ’ll just grow a beard and get a tan .
Sorry , but superficial facial features are given superficial weight .
The key features facial recognition uses are written in bone structures .
Good luck changing the size of your eye sockets , the distance between your eyes , the width of your head , or the corners of your mouth without having your skull smashed by a Freightliner first .
I suspect your best bet at foiling these cameras requires stealing an idea from Claire Wolfe ’s book , Rebelfire :
Out of the Gray Zone , and start a fashion trend in wide - brimmed floppy hats .
The blue dots indicate features the software looks for .
The orange lines are the measurements it takes to plot your face ’s unique characteristics .
Of course , when you enter a place where you are presumed to volunteer your face for biometric examination , you will be required to remove hats and facial coverings ( except prescription eyeglasses , as the software compensates for those ) .
So a wide - brimmed , floppy hat will be great at the basketball game , but wo n’t do you any good checking in for your flight , bus , or train .
And this is established technology .
What ’s next ?
Since facial recognition works by plotting distances between key features , such as the center of the eyes , it is merely an application of formula to take those measurements into three dimensions , thus allowing for facial recognition software to compensate for distance , rotation , and tilt of the head .
That ’s right , 3 - D facial recognition is on the very near horizon .
There are some sweaty little programmers working on it right now .
And here ’s the fun , fun , fun part of why facial recognition was chosen to be the biometric standard around the world .
How many of you readers have had an iris scan taken ?
Anybody ?
Bueller ?
What about fingerprints ?
Okay , a few more of you .
Has the government ever take a photo of you ?
Maybe before you woke up to freedom ?
Driver ’s license ?
Old passport ?
Mug shot ?
See what I mean ?
It ’s an obvious choice when you consider the costs of enrolling the world into an iris scan .
Chances are , they already have a mostly viable photograph of you on file .
It is an elegant convergence of technology and opportunity .
An e-Passport reader demo I viewed scanned the passport , pulled the physical image up , scanned the chip and pulled the digital image up , placed the two side by side for comparison , verified they were identical , took a picture of the person standing in front of them , used facial recognition to compare the person to the pictures , all while comparing the pictures to a watch - list database for a match .
Four points of comparison keyed on one photograph , with three comparison methods engaged : visual comparison by the operator , one - to - one match against the photos on the passport , and one - to - many match against the watch - list databases .
You could already be “ enrolled ” into the international comparison databases by your government without having to volunteer your biometric data .
There are companies who have facial recognition software specialized to finding matches from imperfect mug shots and old photographs .
The vast majority of populations have had their picture taken and those photos are on file , or will be soon .
Now , the folks doing the matching definitely want higher quality source photos , so they want to recapture everyone ’s picture as best as they can , but that merely improves the quality of the result .
Not getting your picture ever taken again does n’t foil the system .
The idea is to have a computer simply flag an operator , “ Hey I got an 80 % match on this fella , check and make sure for me , ” and the operator can do that final 20 % analysis on your face visually , without special training in fingerprints or iris scans .
The computers and the software are used to discount the 80 or 90 % negative matches they expect so the operators can visually verify more people in less time .
Additionally , the biometrics stored in the e-Passport is generic .
It ’s not a formula of your facial characteristics , because ICAO did not want to limit the specification to any particular technology or proprietary format .
It ’s a simple digital image , like any of the billions found on the internet today .
Store the image , and use whatever the latest , greatest software package is available to process it .
This means that if a software application is compromised , the country can simply replace it without having to reissue passports or recapture photos .
However , this does leave room for discrepancy and inconsistent results between countries as they employ different vendors or different facial recognition algorithms to process and recognize e-Passport photographs .
With today ’s technology , a decent source photo such as a passport or driver ’s license photo has a 95 % success rate to match the subject , regardless of any superficial facial features .
Ninety - five percent .
It ’s going to get more effective with time .
Part III
In Part II , I covered the basics of facial recognition , the biometric piece of the e-Passport , and how the technology works and is implemented .
Unless you have never had a government photo taken of you in your adult life , or are willing to alter the bone structure of your face , the technology will probably be able to match you fairly accurately .
In these parts , I cover the technical details of the e-Passport itself .
It gets a bit dry .
I cover document security , chip technology , encryption , and data security .
So if the technical readouts of this battle station are of no interest , I wo n’t get my feelings hurt if you skip parts III and IV .
Neither will the dead Bothans .
Promise .
The Passport
The goal of the passport specifications as developed by ICAO are meant , quite simply , to create the most secure document in the world .
No small undertaking , and quite a distant goal to meet , but that ’s the goal , and they ’ve made some effective decisions to try and reach it .
Now , anyone who has studied security in any depth probably realizes that nothing is secure .
Security is a measure of how expensive it is to thwart the security measures .
Previously , thwarting passport security was a fairly cheap endeavor .
My current passport is a simple printed booklet with a paper photo laminated into the inside cover .
I could probably create one with a decent photo copier , some scissors , and a laminating machine .
But the new passport specs are designed to be more difficult to forge , tamper with , or steal than ever before .
It will be easier to counterfeit money than to counterfeit a passport .
The physical e-Passport .
There are three threats to the security of the e-Passport ; forgeries , falsifications , and illegal issuance .
Forgeries involve the complete creation of a false passport .
Falsifications take an existing legally issued passport and change the data on it .
And illegal issuance is to convince the government to actually issue a legal passport to someone they did n’t want to , or to steal blank passports and issue them fraudulently .
The substrate of the passport , or the paper , is highly recommended to include several features that you ’ll probably recognize from all the Monopoly ™ money floating around the globe nowadays .
UV reactive paper lights up all special and pretty under an ultraviolet lamp .
Dual - tone watermarks are difficult for all but the top - end photocopiers to duplicate .
Chemical reactions like those special pens they use to check a $ 20 can be built into the paper .
Fluorescent fibers , colored flecks , and plastic threads are all options to make it difficult to reproduce legitimate looking passport paper .
An example of UV reactive , chemically sensitive substrate with security threads .
The printing on the passport is also subject to a wide variety of security methods .
These include background art and text , often in rainbow colored print .
There can be UV printing that is invisible to the naked eye but shows up clearly under the same UV lamp .
Micro printing and printed watermarks are also included .
In addition , today ’s printing techniques allow all of the above to be personalized to the passport .
So there could be the bearer ’s name micro-printed or UV - printed into the paper .
Or perhaps the background art includes a UV version of the photograph .
Personalization makes it impossible to get a generic template for the printer to run off a bunch of legitimate looking passports , because each one must be customized .
And printing the data for the passport is not printing on the paper , but into the paper , laminate , or plastic .
The result is that an ink - jet printed passport actually has ink injected into the substrate .
You ca n’t scrape the ink off without damaging the paper , and the paper changes color and shows tampering very easily .
Laser engraving into the laminate offers the same challenges , particularly when that laser engraving is personalized .
An example of laser engraving into the laminate .
And of course , there are the neat - looking OVDs , or Optical Variable Devices such as holograms and foil printing .
Previously we ’ve seen OVDs on credit cards where they are a generic template .
But on the passport , the OVDs can also be personalized , commonly to be either a hologram of the photo or even the entire visual passport .
Another twist on this is using lasers to print refractive OVDs into the laminate of the data page .
Obviously this all requires some very specialized equipment .
Not so obviously , the equipment is n’t very big , and would fit fully assembled onto an average sized dinner table .
An example of a personalized OVD .
Obviously these measures make forging or altering a passport much more expensive and difficult than previously .
And that leads us to the weakest link in the chain , by ICAO ’s own admission , fraudulent issuance of a real passport .
As in all automated systems , and all security systems , and indeed , all systems anywhere and everywhere , human beings can be both the strongest or weakest links in the chain .
In order to secure against the fraudulent issue of legitimate passports , governments are encouraged to greatly tighten their issuance security at every point .
From the ordering and storage of passport materials to the printing process to the application processing agents , they need to maximize security .
They are also encouraged to make multiple people responsible for the approval of a passport so that anyone wanting to bribe their way into a fraudulent passport must bribe two or three or five people instead of just one .
Additionally , governments are encouraged to track all passports from cradle to grave , including spoiled and blank passports .
Interpol ’s I - 24/7 Stolen and Lost Passport database will track any and all non-valid passports and is already in operation catching criminals with false passports today .
And the passport itself is protected against unauthorized issuance by the RFID chip embedded within it .
And that , in turn , leads us to the digital technology .
Part IV
Part III covered the physical design and security of the e-Passport .
In Part IV , I cover the RFID chip , the logical data system , and the digital security features .
More technical read - outs .
No wamp - rats .
ISO 14443 Contact - less Integrated Chip
The International Standards Organization has specification 14443 for contact - less chip design for identification .
The detailed technical specs of this design are available on their site for a fee , if anyone is interested .
ICAO took this specification and narrowed it down to make the passport specifications universally applicable across all the member nations .
It is a radio - frequency ID chip , that ’s the contact - less part .
Mandatory minimum data size is 32 K , although 64 K is recommended , and some countries are implementing even larger storage capacities for their own purposes .
ICAO has specified the LDS , or Logical Data System so that all countries will implement data on the chip the same way .
The LDS consists of 16 data groups .
And here they are :
1. MRZ – the same data that is in the Machine Readable Zone visible on the passport .
Mandatory .
2. Facial image sample – this is the mandatory digital photograph sample to be used for facial recognition .
Usually about 20 K in size .
Conforms to ISO image standard SC37 .
3. Fingerprint image sample – Optional storage for fingerprint biometrics , should the issuing country choose to include it .
Also ISO SC37 standard .
4 . Iris image sample – Optional storage for iris biometrics , should the issuing country choose to include it .
Also ISO SC37 standard .
5 . Secondary facial image storage – Optional storage of a second image .
This is for profile images , angled images much like the multiple angles taken for mug shots .
Not SC37 standard as this will be country - specific ( think National ID images ) .
6. Reserved .
7. Signature image storage – Optional image of the bearer ’s signature .
8. Substrate security features – Optional .
This tells a chip reader what security measures to look for in the paper .
9. Data structure security features – Optional .
This tells a chip reader what security measures to look for in the data structure .
10 . Data security features – Optional .
This tells a chip reader what security measures to look for in the data itself .
11 . Additional personal details – Optional name , alias , address , or document numbers .
This is stored in national characters ( whereas the rest of the document is stored in the Latin alphabet ) .
This means that Arabic language names or Kanji could be reproduced accurately in the native alphabet and length here .
12 . Additional details about the document – Issuing agency , issue date , image of the document , observations , and amendments .
Also in national alphabet instead of Latin .
13 . Optional data field – Anything the country wants to put here .
14 . Reserved .
15 . Active Authentication Public Key ( in the future , this will be used to verify an authorized reader is attempting to access the chip ) .
16 . Emergency contact information – People to contact in case of emergency and their contact information .
In addition , there are six Secure Object Data fields that are stored in the protected memory of the chip .
This is where the hash values and private keys for the encryption are stored .
So as you can see , there ’s quite a bit of potential in these chips .
Lots of room for governments to add what they want , and many of them are taking advantage of it .
Germany is using the fingerprint field and the optional fields to tie their e-Passport to their National ID .
Other governments will use them to tie into social service accounts and records .
We can probably expect that someone will tie it into medical records .
But how is this chip authenticated and secured ?
So glad you asked .
Hashes , Encryption and Keys , Oh My !
The data on a passport includes a hash value of the data in the MRZ ( Machine Readable Zone ) .
What is a hash value ?
Pretty simple concept .
A hash takes a string of characters and performs a calculation on them to get the hash value .
For example , if we say each letter of the alphabet ’s numeric value is its position , A = 1 , B = 2 , C = 3 , and we have a hash formula of +4 , then the hash value of “ ABD ” = 568 , because A ( 1 ) + 4 = 5 , and B ( 2 ) + 4 = 6 .
Usually hash formulas are far more complicated than that , but that ’s the idea .
So the passport contains the data , plus the hash value of the data .
If you want to verify that the data has n’t been changed , you take the data , perform the hash calculation on it , and check and see if it is the same as the hash value stored on the passport .
So in our example , if the hash value presented is 568 , but the data on the passport is ABC , when we apply + 4 to ABC we get 567 as a result , which is different than 568 , and we know the data has been changed .
Of course , the key to this , is keeping the hash formula a secret .
If the formula gets out , a counterfeiter could alter the data , apply the formula , and then alter the hash value to match the forged data .
So the next step is to secure the hash value .
This is done by encrypting the hash value with a 2048 bit encryption scheme .
If you ’re familiar with PGP , this stuff is the same .
The hash is encrypted with a 2048 bit private key , which can only be unlocked using the appropriate public key .
So when a government issues a passport , it calculates the hash value , and then encrypts it with its ultra -secure private key .
That private key is recorded in the inaccessible - to - all - but - itself private memory of the chip ( any hackers feel their Spidey - sense tingling ? ) .
When a reader wants to validate a passport , it looks at the data on the passport and applies the hash calculation .
Then it takes the country ’s public key and uses it to try and open the encrypted hash value stored in the passport .
The chip matches the public key presented by the reader to the private key stored in secured memory and if they match , decrypts the hash value .
The reader then compares the two hash values to see if they match .
So who secures the public keys ?
I am utterly ecstatic that you asked .
The public keys are shared among the issuing countries and to ICAO in what is called the Public Key Directory ( PKD ) .
This is a wide open directory of keys and anyone can download all the keys .
Anyone .
You , me , Joe Blow .
This is because the keys are used to authenticate the data on the passport , not provide privacy protection .
Did you get that ?
The idea is that anyone who needs to validate your passport can download these keys and use them to check that the passport was authentically issued and that the visible and machine readable data matches the data stored on the chip .
What ’s to keep someone from using the public keys to reverse engineer the private keys and make their stolen passports authenticate ?
Fantastic question .
My giblets quiver with joy .
The ICAO PKD also keeps the Country Certificate Authority , which validates that the public keys are still valid .
The recommendation is that each key be used for 90 days or a couple hundred thousand passports .
When using a public key to decrypt a passport , the software should validate the key is still usable with ICAO .
If the key is compromised , the validation fails and the software notifies the operator that the passport may be compromised as well .
Yes , this means that if someone hacks a public key , several hundred thousand people will get pulled aside when they try to use their passports for extra special questioning .
So who secures the Country Certificates ?
Lots of men with lots of guns , knives , and sharp , pointy sticks .
You knew it would come to that .
It always does .
So what about privacy , now that I ’ve brought it up ?
Privacy was one of the biggest complaints about RFID - enabled passports brought to bear by critics .
And while the solution is not perfect , it does appear to satisfy at least some of the complaints .
ICAO recommends ( recommends , not mandates ) that e-Passports be designed with Basic Access Control ( BAC ) in mind .
Basic Access Control is designed to prevent skimming of the passport .
Skimming is what they call it when someone with a chip reader in their pocket waves it over you hoping to trigger the RFID chip and capture its data surreptitiously .
BAC consists of two protections .
One is that the front and back cover of the passport be lined with aluminum to shield the chip ; an honest - to - goodness , official , tinfoil hat .
This means that the book must be opened in order to transmit energy to the chip .
The other part is the implementation of a read key consisting of the MRZ .
The idea is that not only does the book have to be opened , but the Machine Readable Zone must be scanned and transmitted to the chip accurately before the chip will respond to requests .
So even if your passport is open in your pocket , a skimmer would n’t be able to send the right sequence of characters to open the chip except if they were able to accurately predict the data in your passport right down to the check digits in the MRZ .
Most countries are including BAC in their passport design .
Some are not .
The other threat to privacy that ICAO acknowledges is the threat of eavesdropping , this being where , while a legitimate authority ( boy , do I hate that phrase ) is reading your passport ’s chip , someone with a hidden reader nearby is also receiving the transmission .
Unfortunately , the recommendation to protect against this threat is a little weaker and consists of , “ Make sure you buy passport readers that are shielded from eavesdropping ” , thus putting you and me at the mercy of government competence and forethought .
You can sense my confidence all the way over there , ca n’t you .
Unfortunately , ICAO , being a governmental agency , seems to have a rather convenient blind spot regarding privacy .
Yes , they ’ve selected standards and recommended guidelines that help protect my passport data from you , and you from me , but nothing , absolutely nothing , addresses the fact that a few million government agents at entry - level grunt - work border and security jobs will have access to our data through one of the most potentially abusive data networks in the world .
They simply assume that each and every one of us can trust each and every one of them with our absolute holistic transnational identities .
And considering the security levels in place , how hard to you think it will be prove “ them ” wrong if someone on the inside abuses the system ?
Yeah , that ’s my thought too .
Part V
Part III and IV covered the details of the e-Passport , including the security measures of the physical book and the digital design of the chip .
In this concluding part , I speculate , postulate , and theorize on where it ’s all going and what we can do about it .
You might want to have a drink handy .
No , not that drink , a real drink .
The Crystal Ball
This is the fun part .
Speculation , rhetoric , paranoia .
Love it , love it , love it .
All of this will be implemented from two directions .
Scratch that , is being implemented from two directions .
From one direction you will get the “ justified ” version : International arrivals on flights and border control .
From the other side you ’ll get security around social events and infrastructure .
How ubiquitous is the corporate ID badge ?
It ’ll get there too , eventually .
On the travel side you will soon see e-Passport readers on Customs agents ’ desks .
That ’s guaranteed .
Also guaranteed within the next two or three years is that you will see kiosks to check - in for flights where you put your e-Passport into the slot and it automatically takes your picture , validates , and prints your boarding pass .
Most likely , your boarding pass will include your biometric data as well , so that you do n’t give it away before you board the plane , you naughty , naughty boy .
IATA , the International Air Travel Association , AKA , the Airline Cartel , is miffed with this whole development , because they were never invited to the party .
Airlines are seen as the first line of defense against international travelers criminals , and so they are expected to take on the expense of outfitting every check - in terminal and border station with e-Passport readers , e-Passport enabled kiosks , biometric boarding passes and who knows what else .
This will put an even greater burden on your airline employees as they take on an ever burgeoning role as border - agents - with - a - union - paid - smile .
Of course , IATA , which decides how much all airlines will charge for international travel ( Can you say price - fixing ?
I knew you could . ) will have to pay for these multi-million dollar infrastructure upgrades and angry , frustrated , impatient passengers somehow .
The costs are already being reflected in the cost of the e-Passport itself , which is leaning towards a near universal doubling in price .
You and I will pay for it through higher prices on the ticket and possibly service fees and aggravation and profiling .
But folks who trust their government will love the faster lines and easier check - in , even if it costs them their privacy , dignity , and pocketbooks .
And where it ’s implemented internationally , it ’s only a hop and skip and reach - around to require it domestically , although this might be harder in the US since Real ID does n’t conform to the e-Passport specifications .
Give it time .
Once there are enough e-Passports for the airlines to justify their business cases , the model will be developed and it will scale up and down to all different areas and settings .
Almost all major sports events and social gatherings will soon have real - time cameras scanning faces and matching against criminal databases .
It ’s been field tested and it works .
The Olympics , the US Open , the Super Bowl have all had successful facial recognition profiling systems in operation in the past two years .
What is really disturbing is that ICAO openly admits that the facial recognition and watch - lists are effective on their own .
In fact , they recommend that countries use negative facial recognition testing as a solution to criminal border crossings .
In other words , they recommend that , in the interim , while they only have criminals and not everyone in the system yet , countries simply use the system to make sure you ’re not on the watch - list .
This strongly suggests that , if the purpose of facial recognition is to catch criminals , the mug shots and negative testing against the watch - lists are all that is necessary .
But ICAO emphatically wants everyone to move forward with positive identification of this holistic , transnational identity .
All that they need is , “ You are not Osama . ”
That ’s all they need .
But they want , specifically , to positively identify you , even if you do n’t remotely match anyone on a watch list .
Why is that , do you think ?
Non-digital databases of mug shots will eventually be digitized and added to the global databases .
Political rights activists may be able to slow down the adding of driver ’s license and other state - created photo IDs , but eventually , I bet it happens .
The technology needs some improvements ( speed ) , but it ’s only a road bump to facial recognition on the highways .
On the plus side , this might reduce the number of minor traffic stops to fish for criminals , as the cameras will simply notify the cops which cars to chase when they get a near match .
Joe American will love it because he gets surveilled more but probably hassled less , and that ’s just cool with him .
But that assumes your normal traffic stop is actually to fish for criminals and not just a revenue generator .
( Was that a collective sigh I heard ? )
In fact , so far , everyone I ’ve discussed this with seems to love the idea of just scanning their passport and walking onto a plane .
The efficiency it provides far , far outweighs any concerns they have over privacy or tracking , even when they are the ones to mention “ Big Brother ” first .
Apparently Big Brother is just fine and the hash result of 2 + 2 is five .
What can you do ?
To be honest , I ’m not sure .
They ’ve covered many of the bases .
There is no public recourse for this , it ’s a done deal .
There ’s no one to punish , these are n’t elected officials .
Anyone who needs or wants a passport that does n’t reflect their day - to - day identity better already have their alias identity well established .
That is the weakest point in the system .
Somehow , they have to get those initial biometrics and identities matched up .
That ’s the opportunity , and you get only one shot at it .
Did I mention that one of the checks they do when issuing an e-Passport is to validate that no other e-Passport has been issued with matching biometrics ?
No double - issuance here .
Even if you get your assumed identity set up with an e-Passport , you ’ll only be able to travel under that identity .
It will become your holistic , transnational identity , even if it ’s not the name your kids call you .
Your false identity could easily eclipse the validity of your real identity , and I can only guess at the kind of craziness that could generate .
I can just see a bevy of private individuals with successfully false e-Passports on the day the e-Passport and the national driver ’s licenses are married together with the bank records and IRS tax rolls and the same biometric shows up on three identities and trips several dozen alarms across a thousand government and corporate databases while they fill up the tractor at the bio - diesel station that just installed a networked photo camera to comply with their insurance policy .
For myself ?
I came in late to the game , and my state has had digital photos on driver ’s licenses for years .
I can only assume I ’m already compromised .
So I ’m going to try and stay away from airports and buy a big , floppy , sexy hat .
In the world of cutting - edge physics , discoveries are often made using intricate procedures and elaborate , expensive instruments .
But a paper by Cornell graduate student Scott Bunch and colleagues shows how interesting results can also come from much simpler methods .
Bunch found that a single sheet of graphene , a form of carbon atoms in a plane just one atom thick , can be isolated and used as an electromechanical resonator .
The material could be useful for weighing atoms and molecules , which have extremely small masses ; as a membrane to separate gases or to measure pressure ; or for other experiments that call for a very stiff but exceptionally thin and light sheet of material .
The research appears in the Jan. 26 issue of the journal Science .
Creating a sheet of cohesive material just one atom thick is impossible with most substances ; most ball up or disintegrate as they are shaved into ever - thinner slices .
Carbon , though , is unique : in diamonds , its covalent bonds form nature 's hardest substance .
And as graphite , it bonds tightly in a two - dimensional plane but very loosely in the third dimension .
So sloughing off a few layers is as easy as writing with a pencil .
Bunch etched a silicon dioxide wafer with tiny trenches , each about 1 micron ( a millionth of a meter ) wide and 300 nanometers ( a nanometer is a billionth of a meter ) deep .
He spread a light layer of graphite over the wafer simply by gluing a chunk of it onto a toothpick and writing on the wafer 's surface .
Using an optical microscope , he then identified trenches that were spanned by very thin layers ( each tens of thousands of atoms across ) of graphene sheets ( the term for single - atom - thick sheets of graphite ) .
Using atomic force microscopy , which measures the amount of deflecting force a tiny cantilever experiences as it scans nanometers over the surface of a specimen , Bunch and colleagues determined the thickness of the layers ( number of graphene sheets ) that spanned the trenches .
Raman spectroscopy , a technique that measures the way a substance scatters monochromatic light , confirmed that several trenches were spanned by single sheets of graphene .
By delivering a tiny current to the single - atom bridges and using a laser to detect their vibrations , Bunch 's group could determine the stiffness of the material .
" How fast they vibrate is a function of how thick they are , how long they are and how stiff the material itself is , " Bunch said .
" It turns out that graphene is one of the stiffest materials around . "
It 's also ultrathin and light , which might make it valuable as an extremely sensitive scale for tiny masses or a gauge for pressure differences .
And it 's simple .
" These are basically the thinnest vibrating structures you can have , " said Bunch .
" So it 's surprising that they 're so easy to make . "
The paper 's co-authors include Cornell physics graduate students Arend van der Zande and Scott Verbridge ; professors Jeevak Parpia , Harold Craighead and Paul McEuen ; and Pomona College undergraduate Ian Frank and professor David Tanenbaum .
Cheney tried to nix agency targeting him RAW STORY
Published : Friday June 22 , 2007 Print This Email This The Vice President attempted to " nix " the agency that was targeting him , Friday 's New York Times reports .
" For four years , Vice President Dick Cheney has resisted routine oversight of his offices handling of classified information , and when the National Archives unit that monitors classification in the executive branch objected , the vice presidents office suggested abolishing the oversight unit , according to documents released yesterday by a Democratic congressman , " the New York Times reports .
Scott Shane reports , " The Information Security Oversight Office , a unit of the National Archives , appealed the issue to the Justice Department , which has not yet ruled on the matter . "
On Thursday , Michael Roston reported for RAW STORY that the Office of Vice President Dick Cheney told an agency within the National Archives that for purposes of securing classified information , the Vice President 's office is not an 'entity within the executive branch . '
" The Oversight Committee has learned that over the objections of the National Archives , you exempted the Office of the Vice President from the presidential executive order that establishes a uniform , government - wide system for safeguarding classified national security information , " Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) , the Committee 's chairman , wrote in a letter to Cheney .
" Your decision to exempt your office from the President 's order is problematic because it could place national security secrets at risk .
It is also hard to understand given the history of security breaches involving officials in your office . "
Excerpts from Times article : #
In the tradition of Washingtons semantic dust-ups , this one might be described as a fight over what an entity  is .
The executive order , last updated in 2003 and currently under revision , states that it applies to any entity within the executive branch that comes into the possession of classified information .
J. William Leonard , director of the oversight office , has argued in a series of letters to Mr. Addington that the vice presidents office is indeed such an entity .
He noted that previous vice presidents had complied with the request for data on documents classified and declassified , and that Mr. Cheney did so in 2001 and 2002 .
But starting in 2003 , the vice presidents office began refusing to supply the information .
In 2004 , it blocked an on - site inspection by Mr. Leonards office that was routinely carried out across the government to check whether documents were being properly labeled and safely stored .

On January 20 , 2003 , the English journalist William Leith decides he has to lose weight .
That ’s the day he gets on the bathroom scale and finds that it ’s “ the fattest day of my life ” : he ’s just over six feet tall and he weighs two hundred and thirty - six pounds .
He feels lousy .
He feels repulsive .
In fact , he is repulsive .
His girlfriend tells him to stop tucking his shirt into his trousers —
“ It just bulks you out ” — and she does n’t want to have sex with him anymore .
He resolves , not for the first time , to do something about it .
He gets on a plane and goes to New York to see Dr. Atkins , and he decides , more or less at the same time , to write a book about his eating problems .
“ The Hungry Years : Confessions of a Food Addict ” ( Gotham ; $ 25 ) is the result : Bridget Jones with a Y chromosome , a significant coke habit , and a sneaky sort of intellectual ambition .
Leith ’s book is about food addiction , but he ’s interested in all sorts of addictions and what it is about our culture that makes it so easy to stuff ourselves , leaving us filled but unfulfilled : “ This is the fat society .
This is where people come , so they can have exactly what they want .
And what they want is . . . more . ”
Most of all , he ’s interested in himself .
If he can figure out why he ’s a food addict , then maybe he can figure out why he ’s unhappy : “ I am fat because I have other , deeper problems . ”
And if he can figure out what these deeper problems are then maybe he can stop stuffing himself .
The cure has two courses .
The physical bit is getting the weight off ; the psychological bit is getting the weight off his mind .
Dr. Atkins takes care of the first .
Leith arrives at Atkins ’s Manhattan clinic just months before the great man ’s death , and about two years before the “ low - carb craze ” will itself be pronounced dead , with the venture - capital - crammed Atkins Nutritional , Inc. , going into bankruptcy .
But Atkins is then enjoying a boom : some months before , Gary Taubes published a pro-Atkins polemic in the Times Magazine ( “ What If It ’s All Been a Big , Fat Lie ? ” ) , and a copy of New York that Leith picks up declares , “ Welcome to a City in the Throes of CARB PANIC . ”
Leith masters the Atkins metabolic mantra : carbohydrates cause a rush of insulin ; the insulin reduces blood glucose , causing cravings for more carbs ; the body becomes insulin - resistant ; and it shifts its attention to saving fat .
Food fat does n’t make your body fat ; carbs are the culprit .
As the pounds fall off — thirty in four months — Leith becomes an evangelist : his obituary of Atkins in the Guardian of April 19 , 2003 , is a panegyric .
He reads Thomas Kuhn ’s historical theory of scientific development and decides that Atkins is achieving nothing less than a dietary “ paradigm change . ”
Atkins is a hero of our time .
The other part of the cure is psychotherapy .
The Atkins diet is the instrumental arm of a psychodynamic search : it ’s good to lose weight in the most effective way you can , but Leith still feels the need to sort out the psychic reasons that he ’s become a fatty .
There ’s much recollecting of childhood traumas ; original sin for Leith was not an apple but an apple pie — one of his grandmother ’s that he secretly gobbled down at the age of seven .
By the end of his therapy , Leith has concluded that there are “ many many reasons ” for his food addiction .
It ’s too complex for him to understand and , perhaps , too complex for any specific diet to remedy or therapy to analyze .
As the Atkins diet works its wonders , he feels happier : he gets fit , and he even goes for a twenty - five - mile hike with his ( new ? ) girlfriend , at the end of which they pop into a pub and tuck in like ordinary human beings — “ spaghetti with a meat sauce , and some garlic bread , and a bottle of wine . ”
He ’s genuinely hungry for the first time in ages .
As the proverb has it , hunger turns out to be the best sauce .
He winds up — like the growing number of Atkins dieters who have fallen away from the faith — edgily wondering if moderation in all things might , after all , be the answer .
Leith wants to lose weight because he wants not to be repulsive , and he ’s not alone .
A fifth of American men and more than a third of American women say they would like to lose at least twenty pounds , and you do n’t need a statistical survey to establish that sexual appeal is a big part of the reason .
Thundering denunciations of the equation between female thinness and sexiness have little effect .
The world is unfair that way — possibly almost as unfair to fat men as to fat women .
In Paddy Chayefsky ’s 1955 play “ Marty , ” the title character whines , “ I ’m just a fat little man .
A fat ugly man . ”
Moreover , statistics do establish that fat people earn less : possibly because the sort of people who make less money tend to be fat , possibly because fat people are discriminated against , or , most likely , a bit of both .
It was not always so .
When the Duchess of Windsor pronounced that “ you can never be too rich or too thin , ” it was a sign of a demographic shift with far - reaching cultural consequences .
The language that our ancestors used to assess people ’s weight generally had a qualitative and whole - body character : “ thin , ” “ gaunt , ” “ lean , ” “ lanky , ” “ stout , ” “ fleshy , ” “ corpulent , ” “ beefy , ” “ plump , ” “ portly , ” and , finally , “ fat . ”
With some exceptions , it was good to be fat : in the Oxford English Dictionary , one definition of the adjective is “ in well - fed condition , plump , ” and in its figurative usages it signalled an abundance of good things — “ the fat of the land , ” a “ fat living ” for a cleric .
In 1825 , the French gourmand Brillat - Savarin wrote that “ to acquire a perfect degree of plumpness . . . is the life study of every woman in the world . ”
Male or female , body fat showed you were a considerable person , that you commanded resources .
Holbein ’s great portrait of Henry VIII depicts not an obese man but a Big Man .
And fat John Falstaff was , in his own estimation , “ a goodly portly man , i’faith , and a corpulent , of a cheerful look , a pleasing eye , and a most noble carriage . ”
In societies marked by dietary scarcity — which is to say in practically any period before the twentieth century and in practically any present - day country outside the developed world — bodily bulk functions as a visible mark of power , affluence , and even good humor .
In the late Middle Ages , the starving masses fantasized about the Land of Cockaigne , where you could idly gorge yourself on cakes and cream , and the American hobo anthem “ Big Rock Candy Mountain ” was a version of the same never - satisfied dream of abundance : “ There ’s a lake of stew / And of whiskey too /
And you can paddle / All around it in a big canoe . ”
It ’s hard to avoid the conclusion that fat became ugly when the poor became fat .
But being fat is n’t just an aesthetic bane ; it ’s understood to be a medical one as well .
And this , too , is a historically recent development .
When Prince Hal dismissed Falstaff by telling him that “ the grave doth gape for thee thrice wider than for other men , ” he meant to make a joke , not to offer a summary of epidemiological evidence .
Writers from the Renaissance through the nineteenth century were , of course , aware that health risks might attend the very fat .
Even Brillat - Savarin , for whom obesity was essentially a moral , mechanical , and social problem , not a medical one , noted that extreme obesity “ opens the way for various diseases , such as apoplexy , dropsy , and ulcers of the legs , and makes all other ailments more difficult to cure . ”
Yet our ancestors certainly did not recognize a linear relation between increasing weight and health risk , and an over - all association between the gluttonously fat and a shortened life span was sometimes even denied , as when Francis Bacon judged that “ the greatest gluttons are often found the most long - lived . ”
Whatever objections the early moderns had to corpulence were as much moral as they were strictly medical .
People who gorged themselves gave a visible sign of poor self - control ; what mattered was their flawed character , not their mortality risk .
Gluttony was a vice before obesity was a disease .
November 2005
In the next few years , venture capital funds will find themselves squeezed from four directions .
They 're already stuck with a seller 's market , because of the huge amounts they raised at the end of the Bubble and still have n't invested .
This by itself is not the end of the world .
In fact , it 's just a more extreme version of the norm in the VC business : too much money chasing too few deals .
Unfortunately , those few deals now want less and less money , because it 's getting so cheap to start a startup .
The four causes : open source , which makes software free ; Moore 's law , which makes hardware geometrically closer to free ; the Web , which makes promotion free if you 're good ; and better languages , which make development a lot cheaper .
When we started our startup in 1995 , the first three were our biggest expenses .
We had to pay $ 5000 for the Netscape Commerce Server , the only software that then supported secure http connections .
We paid $ 3000 for a server with a 90 MHz processor and 32 meg of memory .
And we paid a PR firm about $ 30,000 to promote our launch .
Now you could get all three for nothing .
You can get the software for free ; people throw away computers more powerful than our first server ; and if you make something good you can generate ten times as much traffic by word of mouth online than our first PR firm got through the print media .
And of course another big change for the average startup is that programming languages have improved -- or rather , the median language has .
At most startups ten years ago , software development meant ten programmers writing code in C ++.
Now the same work might be done by one or two using Python or Ruby .
During the Bubble , a lot of people predicted that startups would outsource their development to India .
I think a better model for the future is David Heinemeier Hansson , who outsourced his development to a more powerful language instead .
A lot of well - known applications are now , like BaseCamp , written by just one programmer .
And one guy is more than 10 x cheaper than ten , because ( a ) he wo n't waste any time in meetings , and ( b ) since he 's probably a founder , he can pay himself nothing .
Because starting a startup is so cheap , venture capitalists now often want to give startups more money than the startups want to take .
VCs like to invest several million at a time .
But as one VC told me after a startup he funded would only take about half a million , " I do n't know what we 're going to do .
Maybe we 'll just have to give some of it back . "
Meaning give some of the fund back to the institutional investors who supplied it , because it was n't going to be possible to invest it all .
Into this already bad situation comes the third problem : Sarbanes - Oxley .
Sarbanes - Oxley is a law , passed after the Bubble , that drastically increases the regulatory burden on public companies .
And in addition to the cost of compliance , which is at least two million dollars a year , the law introduces frightening legal exposure for corporate officers .
An experienced CFO I know said flatly : " I would not want to be CFO of a public company now . "
You might think that responsible corporate governance is an area where you can't go too far .
But you can go too far in any law , and this remark convinced me that Sarbanes - Oxley must have .
This CFO is both the smartest and the most upstanding money guy I know .
If Sarbanes - Oxley deters people like him from being CFOs of public companies , that 's proof enough that it 's broken .
Largely because of Sarbanes - Oxley , few startups go public now .
For all practical purposes , succeeding now equals getting bought .
Which means VCs are now in the business of finding promising little 2 - 3 man startups and pumping them up into companies that cost $ 100 million to acquire .
They did n't mean to be in this business ; it 's just what their business has evolved into .
Hence the fourth problem : the acquirers have begun to realize they can buy wholesale .
Why should they wait for VCs to make the startups they want more expensive ?
Most of what the VCs add , acquirers do n't want anyway .
The acquirers already have brand recognition and HR departments .
What they really want is the software and the developers , and that 's what the startup is in the early phase : concentrated software and developers .
Google , typically , seems to have been the first to figure this out .
" Bring us your startups early , " said Google 's speaker at the Startup School .
They 're quite explicit about it : they like to acquire startups at just the point where they would do a Series A round .
( The Series A round is the first round of real VC funding ; it usually happens in the first year . )
It is a brilliant strategy , and one that other big technology companies will no doubt try to duplicate .
Unless they want to have still more of their lunch eaten by Google .
Of course , Google has an advantage in buying startups : a lot of the people there are rich , or expect to be when their options vest .
Ordinary employees find it very hard to recommend an acquisition ; it 's just too annoying to see a bunch of twenty year olds get rich when you 're still working for salary .
Even if it 's the right thing for your company to do .
The Solution(s )
Bad as things look now , there is a way for VCs to save themselves .
They need to do two things , one of which wo n't surprise them , and another that will seem an anathema .
Let 's start with the obvious one : lobby to get Sarbanes - Oxley loosened .
This law was created to prevent future Enrons , not to destroy the IPO market .
Since the IPO market was practically dead when it passed , few saw what bad effects it would have .
But now that technology has recovered from the last bust , we can see clearly what a bottleneck Sarbanes - Oxley has become .
Startups are fragile plants — seedlings , in fact .
These seedlings are worth protecting , because they grow into the trees of the economy .
Much of the economy 's growth is their growth .
I think most politicians realize that .
But they do n't realize just how fragile startups are , and how easily they can become collateral damage of laws meant to fix some other problem .
Still more dangerously , when you destroy startups , they make very little noise .
If you step on the toes of the coal industry , you 'll hear about it .
But if you inadvertantly squash the startup industry , all that happens is that the founders of the next Google stay in grad school instead of starting a company .
My second suggestion will seem shocking to VCs : let founders cash out partially in the Series A round .
At the moment , when VCs invest in a startup , all the stock they get is newly issued and all the money goes to the company .
They could buy some stock directly from the founders as well .
Most VCs have an almost religious rule against doing this .
They do n't want founders to get a penny till the company is sold or goes public .
VCs are obsessed with control , and they worry that they 'll have less leverage over the founders if the founders have any money .
This is a dumb plan .
In fact , letting the founders sell a little stock early would generally be better for the company , because it would cause the founders ' attitudes toward risk to be aligned with the VCs ' .
As things currently work , their attitudes toward risk tend to be diametrically opposed : the founders , who have nothing , would prefer a 100 % chance of $ 1 million to a 20 % chance of $ 10 million , while the VCs can afford to be " rational " and prefer the latter .
Whatever they say , the reason founders are selling their companies early instead of doing Series A rounds is that they get paid up front .
That first million is just worth so much more than the subsequent ones .
If founders could sell a little stock early , they'd be happy to take VC money and bet the rest on a bigger outcome .
So why not let the founders have that first million , or at least half million ?
The VCs would get same number of shares for the money .
So what if some of the money would go to the founders instead of the company ?
Some VCs will say this is unthinkable — that they want all their money to be put to work growing the company .
But the fact is , the huge size of current VC investments is dictated by the structure of VC funds , not the needs of startups .
Often as not these large investments go to work destroying the company rather than growing it .
The angel investors who funded our startup let the founders sell some stock directly to them , and it was a good deal for everyone .
The angels made a huge return on that investment , so they 're happy .
And for us founders it blunted the terrifying all - or - nothingness of a startup , which in its raw form is more a distraction than a motivator .
If VCs are frightened at the idea of letting founders partially cash out , let me tell them something still more frightening : you are now competing directly with Google .

A Blackpool family has created a " fitting memorial " to deceased dad Mick Egan - by converting him into a synthetic diamond , the BBC reports .
Egan died last year of a brain haemorrhage and his wife Susan decided on a novel way of preserving his memory .
A US company extracted carbon from Egan 's ashes , heated it to create graphite and then compressed the result to create a rough diamond which was then cut to the family 's specifications .
Susan Egan was evidently delighted with the result , enthusing : " We had to have a blue one because my husband 's eyes are blue .
I never visualised that it would be so beautiful until it arrived .
He is my diamond geezer now .
" It was the right thing to do and it just brings me so much comfort that I 've got it now to last forever .
He loved being the centre of attention .
He could light a room up when he walked in it .
In some respects the diamond lights up , which is a memory of how he was . "
The memorial arrived the day before daughter Celeste 's wedding , allowing dad to accompany her down the aisle .
She said : " It was emotional but it was nice emotion because I was pleased that it had happened and that I could have something of my Dad to take down the aisle with me .
It seemed like the right thing to do for us as a family and for my Dad - we think he would have loved the idea . " ®

Surprise ! [ KX ]
Considering the well - known benefits of breastfeeding , it should come as no surprise that for many new mothers , few healthcare professionals are more critical than lactation consultants .
Though providing nourishment to newborns in this manner is an entirely natural thing , in actual practice , it does not always come as easy as some expect .
There are frequently challenges along the way that can prove discouraging and disheartening in the absence of a skilled instructor .
It is recommended that new babies are breastfed for at least the first six months of life in order for them to receive the full complement of nutrients and immunities their mothers can provide .
While it is common for those not in the know to assume that this is a simple proposition , there are many difficulties that can emerge along the way .
Low production , nipple pain , and poor latch are just a few of the issues that routinely plague new moms .
Luckily , a certified New York lactation consultant stands ready to offer the guidance and encouragement necessary to continue on and achieve successful breastfeeding now and well into the future .
While these professionals can certainly bring critical assistance once a baby has arrived , it is even better to enlist the help of a lactation consultant during pregnancy .
By doing so , it is possible to become thoroughly familiar with essential techniques , feeding concerns , breast pump purchases , and more .
Once the infant has been born , this same consultant can offer tips along the way to smooth the transition for both mother and child .
To ensure an effective relationship with a lactation consultant , it is wise to conduct some research and have face - to - face interviews in advance of hiring .
Learning about a prospective consultant ’s prior experience , breastfeeding philosophy , and other key details will help foster a relationship of trust and respect .
Given the sensitive nature of the process involved , it is important to feel entirely comfortable with the person ultimately selected .
When it comes to narrowing a list of possible candidates , consider asking friends and family who have employed a lactation consultant in the past or request a list of referrals from healthcare providers you trust .
Securing recommendations in this way will provide the peace of mind necessary to make an informed decision that works well for everyone .
By availing yourself of the knowledge and training of a New York lactation consultant , you will know you are working to provide your new baby with the best possible start in life , and that is truly priceless .
In economic jargon Iraq is a “ lose - lose ” situation .
In strategic and political terms it is one big mess .
The question – “ There are two kinds of land mines : the kind that explodes when you step on it , and the kind that explodes when you take your foot off .
Which one is Iraq ? ” – already contains the answer .
Iraq is both .
The U.S. can't win the war in Iraq .
But the withdrawal of U.S. and coalition troops would not guarantee stability .
On the contrary , it may only further destabilize Iraq .
The risks are tremendous and the ramifications for the rest of the region are terrifying .
Iraq could disintegrate into three sectors – Kurdish in the north , Shiite in the center and south and Sunni in the rest of the country , with dozens of other fiefdoms and independent warlords and gangs .
The division of Iraq could create a domino effect in other parts of the Middle East .
If Iraq ’s sovereignty is challenged today , tomorrow could see battles over borders and internal instability in countries like Jordan , Lebanon , Syria , the United Arab Emirates or Saudi Arabia .
This potential exists because most of the nations in the region as well as their borders are inventions of 19th and early 20th century colonial powers .
The colonialists drew the borders and divided the Middle East according to their economic or religious interests .
Some of the decisions were simply based on their capricious behavior and emotions .
Thus , the division of the Middle East into political and national units does not necessarily match ethnic , geographic or political logic .
Yet , as in Africa , the colonial borders have been accepted and sanctioned by the local authorities for one major reason : the alternative is worse .
The reality that both options – to withdraw or to stay – are bad ones forces the U.S. to choose not between good or better but between bad or worse .
To remain in Iraq is the worst decision possible .
But improvement can be achieved only by dialogue and engagement with all the major players – above all Russia , Saudi Arabia , Turkey , Syria and , yes Iran .
The Bush administration has to acknowledge that its policies so far have failed .
It has to admit that it needs Iran and Syria to neutralize the Iraqi minefields .
Tehran and Damascus hold important keys to defuse the tension .
Of course it will require the U.S. to be ready to pay a certain price for both countries ’ cooperation , and to make concessions .
In return for Syria ’s consent to tighten security at its border with Iraq to end its support for Hezbollah in Lebanon , the U.S. will have to promise President Bashar al - Assad to improve relations with him , provide economic incentives and bring Israel to negotiate a peace agreement with him , with the ultimate goal of returning the Israeli - occupied Golan Heights .
Such a deal is possible .
It is within U.S. power .
And securing a deal with Syria to help save America ’s face in Iraq would not necessarily be a counterproductive move for Israel ’s interests either .
As far as Iran is concerned , the chances of a deal are less promising .
A deal with Iran has to be comprehensive : not only about reducing Tehran 's intervention in Iraqi politics and its support for Shiite militias .
The deal will have to cover Afghanistan and the most sensitive issue of all – Iran 's desire to have nuclear weapons .
How to achieve this after nearly thirty years of mistrust , hard feelings , bad blood , conflicting interests and distorted messages between Iran and the U.S. ?
Easier said than done .
And still one has to try .
The Sharm el - Sheikh summit offers a good opportunity .
It is a good launching pad .
The expected meeting between the U.S. Secretary of State and Iran 's Minister of Foreign Affairs shows that there is no alternative to talking .

This is an introduction to the state of the art in Grid Computing in mid-2006 .
I start with some definitions and motivation , look at grid economics , survey the kinds of infrastructure that are out there now , and touch on future directions .
The introduction is “ brief ” in the sense that it does little more than touch the surface of the subject , but it ’s still immensely long for a blog .
[ Update : MapReduce is here and multi - node today !
It ’s called Hadoop . ]
Defining Terms · Houston , we have a problem : nobody agrees what “ Grid ” means .
Check out Wikipedia for a list of alternative definitions .
Whatever .
I think that the massed Opterons folding proteins in university computing centers are grids .
I think the Google and Yahoo data centers handling a kazillion searches a day are too .
And I think that SETI@Home is too .
So I ’m going to be sloppy and use “ grid ” to mean any scenario where you want a good way to throw a whole bunch of computers in parallel at a problem , and you want some infrastructure there to help .
How I Got Here ·
For an application I was thinking of , I needed something like memcached or Prevayler or Tangosol Coherence ; a really fast distributed hash table storing data in RAM across a lot of machines .
I looked at those things and eventually decided they did n’t really meet my needs , so I built my own .
It worked pretty well ( fast ! ) , but once I was finished I realized the infrastructure was broken .
I had to pick what machines I was going to run on and preconfigure the system with static files .
Which was n’t good enough , since I wanted to be able to add machines to the grid on demand , and to detect and survive the condition when a machine failed .
So I decided I needed to run it on one of these new - fangled “ Grid ” thingies and went looking for infrastructure .
This article details what I found .
I do n’t claim it ’s complete , just that it represents the results of research by a motivated non-specialist .
Grids are Great ... · Grids are becoming attractive in a lot of different scenarios .
One reason is that we ’re all generally moving toward scaling out rather than up ; throwing lots of relatively cheap machines at problems in parallel , rather than trying to use one big honking mainframe - class box .
The potential wins in flexibility and scaling are huge ; of course , life gets more complex .
Another driving force is one of my favorite mantras : “ Memory is the new disk .
Disk is the new tape . ”
( First uttered by Jim Gray . )
This is true in a bunch of different ways .
First , memory is several orders of magnitude faster than disk for random access to data ( even the highest - end disk storage subsystems struggle to reach 1,000 seeks / second ) .
Second , with data - center networks getting faster , it ’s not only cheaper to access memory than disk , it ’s cheaper to access another computer ’s memory through the network .
As I write , Sun ’s Infiniband product line includes a switch with 9 fully - interconnected non-blocking ports each running at 30 G bit / sec ; yow !
The Voltaire product pictured above has even more ports ; the mind boggles .
( If you want the absolute last word on this kind of ultra - high - performance networking , check out Andreas Bechtolsheim ’s Stanford lecture . )
Do n’t forget the disk part of the mantra .
For random access , disks are irritatingly slow ; but if you pretend that a disk is a tape drive , it can soak up sequential data at an astounding rate ; it ’s a natural for logging and journaling a primarily - in - RAM application .
So , why would n’t you deploy a grid for every computing platform ?
... Except When
They ’re Not · Jim Gray ( of Microsoft research , quoted above , pictured here ) published a wonderful paper in 2003 entitled Distributed Computing Economics ; the abstract says : “ Today there is rough price parity between ( 1 ) one database access , ( 2 ) ten bytes of network traffic , ( 3 ) 100,000 instructions , ( 4 ) 10 bytes of disk storage , and ( 5 ) a megabyte of disk bandwidth . ”
Let ’s put that another way : memory space and compute cycles are pretty cheap .
Disk space is effectively free .
Moving data around in large quantities is expensive .
In Jim ’s case , he ’s been working with big astronautical data sets .
When he wants to send one to a colleague on the other side of the continent , he loads it onto a desk - side computer stuffed with 250G disks , puts that in a FedEx box and off it goes .
The take - away is that you ’d like to maximize the ratio of the amount of computation to the amount of data traffic .
The perfect example , of course , is SETI@Home , in which remote nodes perform lengthy calculations on tiny chunks of data .
Another approach , of course , is to have the data live in the grid .
Consider a big search engine like Google or Yahoo : the incoming requests and outgoing results are modest in size ; the data living in the grid is enormous , but it stays there .
Two Kinds of Grids ·
Here ’s what real - world grids do today :
Render movies .
Simulate circuits .
Predict financial risks and returns .
Model oil - fields .
Build Web search indices .
Search the Web .
One of these is not like the others .
Items 1 through 5 in the list above are batch jobs .
This is what a lot of grids do ; let ’s call them “ batch grids ” .
Searching the Web is n’t a batch job at all , it ’s online 24x7x365 and will go on providing this service as long as Homo sapiens is still using computers .
The notion of a Web search engine “ ending ” or “ completing ” is silly .
Let ’s call this kind of grid a “ service - oriented grid ” .
By definition , a service - oriented grid has to be available , which means you have to be able to connect to it while it ’s running .
Also , for the economic reasons we discussed above , the data pretty well has to live in the grid .
Batch and Service - oriented Grids Today ·
This table groups grid technologies by batch or service orientation , and also by whether they ’re here now and deployed now , or still largely speculative for one reason or another .
The Grid Landscape Today Futures Batch MPI , MapReduce , SGE , DRMAA Service - Oriented Globus , Google , Yahoo , etc. Rio , Gridbus
I ’ll touch on each of these and try to end up with a compete - ish picture of the current landscape .
MPI · It stands for Message Passing Interface , and may be found at MPI - Forum.org .
MPI was first standardized in 1994 , and the current MPI - 2 dates from 1997 .
It ’s a set of FORTRAN and C libraries for doing parallel computing , taking care of the bookkeeping of moving data around among processes working together in a grid ; it also does parallel I/O .
I looked around and found some talk about Java APIs , but nothing that looked like it had complete coverage and was being maintained and used .
This is n’t surprising , because the style of the API is very un -Java .
MPI is by far the world ’s most popular “ grid ” API , in terms of code that ’s actually being run today by real people to do real work .
If you go to any academic supercomputing center , you can bet they ’ll be running a lot of MPI .
It supports several message - passing patterns : point - to - point , broadcast , and so on .
You can call it synchronously ( do n’t return until the messages get there ) or asynchronously ( launch the message traffic and I ’ll go on working ) .
It ’s got language - independent data binding , if by “ language - independent ” you mean “ FORTRAN and C ” .
Here ’s a basic C - language call from the MPI Tutorial at NCSA .
int MPI_Bcast ( void * buffer , int count , MPI_Datatype datatype , int rank , MPI_Comm comm ) ;
Co-operating programs in MPI lingo are called “ Processors ” , by which they mean “ processes ” .
They live in a named cluster , each identified by an integer called its “ rank ” .
In the call above , count items whose type is given by datatype and which are stored at the address given by buffer will be copied from buffer in the processor identified by rank to buffer in all the other processors in the group identified by comm ; it ’s a broadcast operation .
MPI can group the processes into matrices and sub-matrices to divide the work up .
It also has an interesting “ Reduce ” operation , which can aggregate data from many processors , put it through a computation step , and store the result in one of them .
This provides a natural lead - in to what is probably the single most important advance in batch grid technology in the last decade ; Google ’s MapReduce .
MapReduce ·
This is described in MapReduce : Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters by Jeffrey Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat .
It ’s an absolutely remarkable piece of work , and I recommend that anyone who cares about this stuff read it .
The idea is that the programmer provides a map function , which reads ( usually a modest number ) of key / value pairs and emits ( usually a large number ) of other key / value pairs , and a reduce function , which takes the map output pairs , aggregated by key , and produces a useful result .
Here ’s an example from the paper that shows how you ’d use it to count the number of occurrences of each unique word in a large number of documents .
map ( String input_key , String input_value ) : // input_key : document name // input_value : document contents for each word w in input_value : EmitIntermediate (w , " 1 " ) ; reduce ( String output_key , Iterator intermediate_values ) : // output_key : a word // output_values : a list of counts int result = 0 ; for each v in intermediate_values : result += ParseInt( v ) ; Emit( AsString ( result ) ) ;
The MapReduce implementation ( in C++ ) is tremendously clever ; it uses some elegant tricks to work around machines which fail in mid-run , machines which run anomalously slow , and even bugs that are provoked by weird input values .
The benchmark results are impressive : a grep style program running on a few thousand CPUs scanned 1010 100 - byte records , extracting 92,000 matches , in 80 seconds ; and sorted those 1010 records in 839 seconds .
MapReduce really represents a qualitative step forward in the state of the art .
Java fans will be delighted to hear that Doug Cutting , of Lucene and Nutch fame , is working on a Java version called Hadoop .
The benchmark results are impressive already .
The Sun Grid Engine ·
This is a specialized instance of Sun ’s N1 Grid Engine deployed on the public - facing Sun Grid .
The easiest way to introduce it is to look at how you ’d run a simple job , for example :
Step1 initializes , reads data file “ input.txt ” , writes three intermediate files .
Step2 processes them in parallel , writes three output files , no cross-dependencies .
Step3 processes the three output files to generate the final output .
Let ’s assume there are shell scripts step1.sh , step2.sh , and step3.sh which run the steps .
You ’d create a shell script , say it ’s called run.sh , like so :
#!/bin/sh qsub - N step1 -b n step1.sh qsub - N step2 - hold_jid step1 -b n step2.sh qsub - N step2 - hold_jid step1 -b n step2.sh qsub - N step2 - hold_jid step1 -b n step2.sh qsub - hold_jid step2 -b n step3.sh
The qsub command does all the work .
Its - b argument is for “ binary ” , in this case the value is always “ n ” for no , since these are scripts .
The the - N assigns a job - step ID , so step1.sh is called “ step1 ” .
The - hold - jid argument says not to run until all jobs with the named job - step ID have completed .
Note that the last step does n’t need to have a job - step ID because there ’s nothing waiting for it to complete .
Then you zip up run.sh , step*.sh , and input . txt ; you use a Web GUI to submit the zipfile to the grid engine , track its process , and , when it ’s done , fetch the output .
This all works just fine and people are running these kinds of jobs right now today .
It ’s amazingly reminiscent of the JCL that we used to use to submit punched - card decks to mainframes when I was a kid .
Which is OK ; that was highly evolved technology and is entirely appropriate for batch - job wrangling .
The Sun Grid creates a private subnet , connected to nothing , for each job , as well as a private filesystem .
So obviously it ’s not service - oriented in any meaningful way .
The Grid people are aware that service - oriented grids are interesting , but they ’re also keenly aware that our grid , in the hands of a malicious user , could flatten any given bank in seconds , and maybe even give Google a headache .
The Global Grid Forum ·
On the net at ggf.org , this organization first met in 2001 .
It ’s big ; there are 34 working groups .
They ’ve produced a ton of specifications , the best known of which are DRMAA and OGSA .
DRMAA is not very interesting .
It provides C and Java interfaces that let programmers do more or less what the Grid Engine ’s qsub and friends do ; it ’s been implemented on the Sun Grid and in “ Project Condor ” at the University of Wisconsin - Madison .
OGSA , for Open Grid Services Architecture , is a much bigger thing , an attempt to provide standardized general - purpose infrastructure for a service - oriented grid .
One of their use cases gives a good flavor for the kind of problem they ’re addressing , and is interesting .
Imagine a grid which is receiving telemetry data from all over the Caribbean : air and water temperature , barometric pressure , wind speed .
If you see sudden changes in a bunch of these over a 50 - square - km area , you need to run some large - scale hurricane simulations Pretty Damn Quick to decide whether or not to evacuate New Orleans .
OGSA tries hard to Solve The Whole Problem , and it ’s based on the WS -* technologies ; indeed , it is a key contributor to WSRF ( Web Services Resource Framework ) .
There ’s another organization , Globus , which actually produces open - source implementations of OGSA standards ; here ’s a block diagram of the architecture from their online tutorial .
To give more flavor , here ’s an excerpt :
Writing and deploying a WSRF Web Service is easier than you might think .
You just have to follow five simple steps .
Define the service 's interface .
This is done with WSDL Implement the service .
This is done with Java .
Define the deployment parameters .
This is done with WSDD and JNDI .
Compile everything and generate a GAR file .
This is done with Ant. Deploy service .
This is also done with a GT4 tool .
This is not just theory , the Globus toolkit is in release 4 and ( they claim ) is being used by a whole bunch of different academic - research projects .
Clearly , there is a remarkable amount of flexibility in this architecture , purchased at the price of complexity .
There will also be a runtime cost to all the SOAP - packet marshaling and unmarshaling ; whether it ’s significant will be highly dependent on application specifics .
I ’m probably the wrong person to come to for an opinion on OGSA and Globus .
Not only is my antipathy to the WS -* suite well - known , but the specs clustering around WSRF have always struck me as particularly offensive , since on the face of it they seem to re-implement HTTP ( badly ) on top of SOAP on top of HTTP .
Having said all that , it seems like Globus is an actual running , usable instance of general - purpose service - oriented grid infrastructure .
In fact , the only one I ’ve encountered .
Rio ·
When I started looking around for grid infrastructure , a bunch of different people pointed me at the Jini Rio Framework .
Here ’s its architecture diagram .
Rio ’s introductory text says “ Project Rio provides a model to dynamically instantiate , monitor & manage service components as described in an architectural meta - model called an OperationalString . ”
It ’s based on multiple layers of abstraction and the documentation uses lots of words that I thought I understood in ways that make it obvious they mean something different .
To start with , I do n’t know what an “ architectural meta - model ” is .
Rio ’s sample “ Hello World ” app has one interface , six classes , and 625 lines of code .
Now , to be fair , it ’s very complete and and has a nice Swing user interface .
Rio provides a lot of facilities that sound like they ought to be useful , including help for handling errors and failures in your infrastructure .
It ’s pretty clear that understanding Rio is going to take a lot of work , and if you ’re going to be using something for infrastructure in a large - scale high - performance situation , it ’s important to understand all the layers thoroughly .
I think that Rio has a terrific future , but seriously needs work to reduce the barrier to entry .
Gridbus ·
If you go Googling around for “ Service - Oriented Grid ” you ’re pretty quickly going to run up against the work of Prof.
Rajkumar Buyya ( right ) of the University of Melbourne , director of the Gridbus project .
Like OGSA , Gridbus is ambitious , but in a different direction .
It aims to provide an infrastructure that comprises not only the technical requirements for doing grid computing , but also an economic model so that multiple players can combine dynamically to offer a grid utility , competing for business .
There is apparently a .
NET - based implementation of at least part of the theory , called Alchemi , which reached 1.0 in December 2005 .
Web - Facing Service - Oriented Grids ·
Of course , multitudes of people do grid computing every day , when they search at Yahoo ! or Google , or shop at Amazon , or use any of a huge number of Web - facing services .
Most of which are implemented as grids ; it ’s the only practical way to deal with Web - scale traffic .
The trouble is that these guys all build their infrastructure themselves , by hand , down to the metal .
None of them are in the business of offering general - purpose grid infrastructure that you can use to run your programs on your computers , or even on theirs .
So let ’s revisit that table above , adding “ Infrastructure ” to the title and removing all the entries that are n’t in the you - can -use - it infrastructure business :

Conclusion ·
There are a lot of options out there ; this article has reviewed the ones that I turned up when I was looking for something to use myself .
Unfortunately , I decided that none of them really met my needs .
My problem is that I ’ve been a Unix guy for twenty years and a Web guy for ten .
My feeling is that if something says it ’s a service , the right way to talk to it is to get a hostname / port - number combination , call it up , send a request , and wait for a response .
My feeling is that a good way to have processes work together is for them to exchange streams of text using standard input and standard output .
My feeling is that if I ’m going to be stressing out the performance of an app on a grid , I do n’t want too many layers of abstraction between me and the messages .
My feeling is that server failures are going to have to be handled in an application - specific way , not pushed down into the abstraction layer .
So I ended up writing my own piece of service - oriented grid infrastructure , named Sigrid , which is n’t like any of the other things in this essay .
I ’ll write that up here soon .
But I ’m 100 % sure that there are lots of problems out there where one of the alternatives described here will do just what you want .
With lumps of buttery mashed potatoes , steaming hunks of thick turkey , and slabs of hearty pumpkin pie , many of us used Thanksgiving to kick off a holiday season full of steaming , rich cuisine .
But why is it that we reach for heavy warm foods when the weather gets colder ?
Is it custom and habit , or is something more at work ?
In a 1998 issue of Vegetarian Times , Lisa Turner explains that substantial foods , which are often high in calories and fat , break down more slowly in the digestive tract , releasing a steady flow of energy to the body and raising internal body temperature .
High calorie , fatty foods are the only thing that gets some of our fellow mammals through the winter : bears transform such foods into thick insulation so that they can sleep through the winter , and other animals , like squirrels , use the energy to survive the cold winter months .
Though it may be surprising , the colorful vegetables which decorate winter ’s colorful tables are dense themselves .
The prominence of these hearty vegetables , from pumpkins to beets to acorn squash , which ripen just in time to take the place of summer ’s fresh tomatoes , zucchini and lettuce , is another reason winter fare tends to be denser .
Unfortunately for humans , winter often means enjoying less physical activity outside in the cold and more cocoa by the radiator , so rather than burning off those extra calories , we get the infamous holiday weight gain .
Our mammalian instincts are not the only thing that makes us eat fatty foods in winter : Kate Heyhoe , in her online column Global Gourmet Today , explains that culture drives some wintertime culinary customs .
Chinese tradition identifies winter as a season for rich and hot “ yang ” foods like beef and chicken , bamboo and mushrooms , and spicy or sour dishes .
There may be physiological support for this cultural custom .
Chili peppers , which are commonly used in “ yang ” foods , get their bite from a compound called capsaicin .
This compound quickens the body ’s metabolism and produces heat , writes Vikki Ortiz for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in Wisconsin .
The ginger and garlic also used in these dishes contain natural antibacterial compounds .
Vitamin C and beta carotene – also found in winter vegetables like carrots and broccoli – can stimulate the immune system , helping the body fend off winter bugs like the flu and sinus infections .
All these things — including tradition and familiarity — affect our preferences for down - home , winter comfort food , but when a comfort food becomes a lifeline , there may be more going on than cherished memories and mammalian instincts .
When coupled with depression , fatigue , or withdrawal from society , excessive cravings for high - carb , high - fat foods may be a sign of winter Seasonal Affective Disorder , or SAD .
Winter SAD may be caused by lack of sunlight , according to the American Academy of Family Physicians web site .
The symptoms may be eased by extra light exposure .
If more time spent outside or by a window is not enough , a doctor may recommend use of a light box , but not tanning beds which contain harmful UV light that ages and burns skin .
The symptoms usually stop naturally in the springtime , as sunlight increases and creamy casseroles give way to crisp salads .
Our seasonal culinary desires have their roots in biochemistry and instincts , in seasonal availability and in cultural or family traditions .
From Grandma ’s herb - roasted turkey to Aunt Beverly ’s sweet potato bake , we have many reasons to reach for rich heavy comfort foods as the wind turns chilly .

You know something is up when a film like V for Vendetta is a box office hit .
Adapted from a series of graphic novelettes ( i.e. , comic books ) written by Alan Moore and illustrated by David Lloyd , the plot is set in a dystopian future Britain where " the Party " rules , dissidents are rounded up , the Koran is banned , and the threat of terrorism keeps the ruling elite firmly entrenched in power .
From his underground lair , " V " is a kind of futuristic Scarlet Pimpernel , who strikes out at the regime  destroying the Old Bailey in a spectacular pyrotechnic display  while reciting sonnets from Shakespeare and wooing a beautiful girl whose fate has been delivered into his gloved hands .
He wears a mask  a sardonic visage reminiscent , at least in my mind , of Cyrano de Bergerac  and as the plot unfolds so does the origin of his vendetta against the Powers That Be : he was tortured and disfigured by the regime ’s renditioners .
As he kills those responsible for his agony , one by one , the viewer is led toward the denouement : a reenactment of the Guy Fawkes legend , in which the modern - day incarnation of that early - 17th - century English subversive succeeds in blowing up Parliament and sparking a revolution .
The right wing hates this movie , and it is n’t hard to see why : it explodes all their pretensions about being the party of " freedom , " and it pretty clearly parallels the hypocritical cant of the War Party as it pretends to battle " terrorism " while engaging in a campaign of state terrorism that far surpasses anything a small band of amateurs could possibly hope to dish out .
They must find particularly galling a subplot in which evidence emerges that a deadly series of biowarfare attacks attributed to " religious fanatics " ( and we do n’t mean George W. Bush and Jerry Falwell ) turn out to be the work of a sinister cabal inside the government  the perfect excuse for a crackdown .
All of this  economic collapse , political turmoil , the dictatorship of " the Party "  is clearly identified in the film as the product of a series of wars , stretching from Iraq to Syria to Iran and beyond .
I was particularly intrigued by references to " the former United States of America , " and hints of a future history in which imperialism has drained the once mighty U.S. until it is a pitiful husk of its former self , crippled by economic dislocation and embroiled in civil war .
You would think that the Brits , themselves victims of imperial overstretch , would sympathize with " the colonies , " but the anti-Americanism of " the Party " is virulent  and that is a clever touch indeed .
We are treated , early on , to a display of the most vulgar Yankee - bashing by a Rush Limbaugh - type bloviator , " the Voice of London , " a preening , braying , drugged - out shill who barks out government propaganda over the British Television Network ( BTN ) .
He sneers at the " Yanks " who " had everything " and then , in a mere 20 years or so , gave in to softness , liberalism , and appeasement and " lost it all . "
The sound of gloating in his snarl and the vicious hostility in his voice as he rails against an offer of American aid makes a real point about the kind of nationalist vaunting represented by " the Party " : it does n’t allow for any international rivals .
Every competing center of power is a threat , and when a competitor goes down one is expected to kick him in the teeth .
Those weak - willed Americans , they thought they had it all : but they did n’t have the stuff of which real empire - builders are made .
There is a faint echo , here , of Niall Ferguson ‘s contempt for our lack of the proper Anglo - Saxon imperial instinct , as well as a unique twist on the War Party ’s favorite charge of " anti-Americanism . "
Another skillful touch is the evocation of the end of the Soviet empire as the regime of " the Party " dissolves .
" Remember , remember the fifth of November " : Guy Fawkes Day in England and the date chosen by " V " as the day his own personal insurrection is scheduled to become more generalized .
As thousands gather in front of Parliament in response to his call , all garbed in " V " - style masks and flowing black capes , and move toward the massive legions of " the Party , " one thing is clear : the regime has been decapitated .
The gendarmes receive no order to move : the government ’s response to a full - scale revolt is complete paralysis .
The crowd cuts through the wall of steel thrown up around Parliament , like one of " V " ’s whirling knives slicing the throats of his adversaries .
" The Party " is finished .
There was an attempt to demonize this film because it supposedly " advocates terrorism , " but that fell flat when it became a box office hit  did the neocons and their fellow red - state fascists really mean to be saying that the movie - going American public is pro-terrorist ?
Clearly , the regime depicted in the movie deserves to be overthrown , and that lesson is eventually learned by the female lead ( Natalie Portman ) , who spends a lot of time arguing with " V " over the morality of righteous murder .
As he hunts down and knocks off his torturers , leaving a single red rose on the corpses as a sign of his authorship , " V " has to listen to her whining and caviling until he subjects her to a simulated imprisonment in the regime ’s torture chambers ( which her parents actually endured ) , and she  finally !
 generates the requisite amount of rage to understand the meaning of justice .
The two of them become a team of moral avengers , roles that evoke the origin of this script in the comic book genre .
The movie version renders these characters in full , multidimensional reality while retaining the larger - than - life symbolism redolent of the graphic novel form .
And the acting ai n’t bad , either
Go see V for Vendetta , and remember this : by supporting a work of art that embodies your political and philosophical values , you are helping to fight the cultural rot that the War Party feeds on .
There is a scene in the movie when Natalie Portman is going about her job at the BTN and passes a security guard watching some ridiculous " reality " show .
She asks , " How can you watch that trash ? "
The contempt in her voice is clearly that of the authors of this script , who are acutely aware of the political consequences of entertainment as cultural " soma . "
Alternately , a key moment as the anti-regime revolution gathers force is the rebellion of a BTN celebrity , who turns his show into a satire of the high chancellor ( waspishly and brilliantly played by John Hurt ) .
The catalytic revolutionary moment occurs when the public stops believing the lies of the regime  a moment V for Vendetta brings closer to realization in our own world .
The value of the media as a political weapon is clearly understood by the makers of this movie , and they utilize it to make their effort a resounding success .
I have to add that V for Vendetta seems to be part of a larger trend in which political analysis of a " subversive " sort is once again becoming embedded in popular culture , not only in the movies but in song lyrics  particularly rap music .
Now , I ’m no fan of Eminem or Public Enemy  this guy is more my style  but I ’m glad to see that song lyrics are now becoming concerned with something more than odes to sex , drugs , and a relentless narcissism .
In his famous essay " The End of History , " Francis Fukuyama predicted that the arts would degenerate , under a regime of global American hegemony , into something that Alexandre Kojeve , his mentor , likened to " the buzzing of bees . "
" In the post - historical period , " wrote Fukuyama , " there will be neither art nor philosophy , just the perpetual caretaking of the museum of human history . "
And indeed this has seemed to be the case , recently , particularly in the field of music , where the cult of sensuality has seduced Americans away from anything that might upset the Regime too much  except for an occasional reprimand from the FCC for a too - brazen display of sexuality .
In short , I am thrilled to learn , via this movie and other cultural phenomena , that history has apparently not ended , at least in the cultural sense  and for that we should all breathe a sigh of relief .

LONDON , April 5 — The 15 British marines and sailors held captive in Iran for nearly two weeks arrived back home today .
But Britain ’s relief at their safe return was tarnished by questions about how they behaved during their detention and why they had been captured in the first place .
At the same time , Prime Minister Tony Bair abandoned the careful , diplomatic language he used during the crisis .
Today , when the captives were safely en route to Britain , his tone became tough , almost antagonistic , as he spoke of possible links between the Iranian government and terrorism in Iraq .

The British captives ’ homecoming was carefully choreographed .
On Wednesday , before their release in Tehran , they were shown on television wearing outfits issued by the Iranian government — ill - fitting suits for the men and a headscarf and trousers for the lone woman , Leading Seaman Faye Turney .
But when they arrived at Heathrow Airport outside London today , the eight sailors and seven marines were dressed once more in military clothing that had been flown in from Britain .

The following is my term paper , graded an " A , " from my Philosophy of Evolution college class ; it was written in May 2004 .
I have made some relatively slight modifications to the original draft .
Michael Behe is an " Intelligent Design " theorist .
In a paper he wrote , titled Molecular Machines : Experimental Support for the Design Inference and available for review at http://www.arn.org/docs/behe/mb_mm92496.htm, he presents a condensed version of his case for Intelligent Design and against the theory of evolution by natural selection .
The key tenet of his argument for design is " irreducible complexity , " which he alleges is present throughout the biological world and impossible to achieve through evolution by natural selection .
To define this phenomenon , he writes :
By irreducible complexity I mean a single system which is composed of several interacting parts that contribute to the basic function , and where the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning .
An irreducibly complex system cannot be produced gradually by slight , successive modifications of a precursor system , since any precursor to an irreducibly complex system is by definition nonfunctional .
Behe uses his famous mousetrap argument to explain his point , turning it into an argument by analogy , citing both human and nonhuman natural structures as analogous to a mousetrap in the impossibility of their formation by successive modification .
Behe begins by explicating the mousetrap .
A mousetrap has 1 .
A platform to serve as the base ; 2 . A hammer to trap the mouse ; 3 . A spring that is connected to the base that will hold the hammer in place , 4 .
A catch to release the hammer when set ; 5 . A bar , connected to the catch , to hold back the hammer when the trap is set .
Behe argues that each part of the mousetrap works with all the other parts and that each part is absolutely necessary for the trap to function .
He correctly states that if , for example , the hammer was taken out , the mousetrap would effectively cease working .
So , he argues , a mousetrap is an irreducibly complex system that must have been designed , since it could not have been created through succession with modification — any precursors , he says , would be worthless .
Behe uses an argument by analogy to connect the mousetrap to biological systems , saying that the design inference he uses with mousetraps must also apply to things like cilia .
He goes into detail explaining the complexity of cilia , writing :
Cilia are composed of at least a half dozen proteins : alpha-tubulin , beta - tubulin , dynein , nexin , spoke protein , and a central bridge protein .
These combine to perform one task , ciliary motion , and all of these proteins must be present for the cilium to function .
If the tubulins are absent , then there are no filaments to slide ; if the dynein is missing , then the cilium remains rigid and motionless ; if nexin or the other connecting proteins are missing , then the axoneme falls apart when the filaments slide .
So , he argues , missing any part of the modern cilium , function would be impossible and , therefore , the remains would be useless .
Half a cilium would be nonfunctional and not favored by natural selection , and , therefore , the modern cilia would never come to be .
After all , natural selection cannot anticipate future gain , and so immediate gain must exist for it to select for something .
Behe uses the identical argument for complex structures like the human eye and bacterial flagellum , as well as functions like blood clotting and photosynthesis .
Even before moving to objections scientists have raised to Behe ’s argument , I wish to name a few of my own .
First ,
Behe talks in the paper of “ black boxes . ”
Saying that sometimes “ a key piece of a particular scientific puzzle [ is ] beyond the understanding of the age , ” Behe defines the term as “ a machine or structure or process that does something , but the actual mechanism by which it accomplishes its task is unknown . ”
While arguing for a precise scientific explanation of how structures he calls irreducibly complex could have come to be , he writes , “ This is the level of explanation that Biological science eventually must aim for .
In order to say that some function is understood , every relevant step in the process must be elucidated . ”
Unfortunately , Behe is now just setting himself up for trouble .
Here , Behe is clearly guilty of the same offense of which he accuses Darwinians .
He is assuming design without being able to explain a bit about how it happened — not a single step in the process .
He is looking at the structure of the human eye , assuming design , and leaving that black box shut , not peering into the details of how such design could actually occur .
God is not an explanation because God is a way of stopping the cycle of questions .
By citing God , research into a particular phenomenon ends — no more knowledge can be gained .
For example , think about earthquakes .
Suppose , 600 years ago , it was decided that God produced earthquakes .
That would have prevented discovery of the truths we know now .
In this way , God is a cop -out for what we have yet to understand fully ; worse yet , God is an outright impediment to such discovery .
Moving on to a formal retort to Behe ’s argument , I visited the website http://www.world-of-dawkins.com/Catalano/box/behe.shtml.
Immediately , the writer points out what I just explained : Behe offers no explanation of how Intelligent Design works in terms of steps , laws or explanatory models .
He infers design in exactly the same way he accuses evolutionists of inferring selection .
Immediately , the site dismantles the key tenet of Behe ’s argument : that irreducibly complex systems cannot have been created through succession with modification .
First , the site reminds us that biochemical structures “ evolve layer upon layer , contingency upon contingency , always in flux , and retooling to serve current functions . ”
That means , if we use the mousetrap example momentarily , the function could have changed over the course of time .
Say the base came into existence first .
It could have been selected for as an effective paperweight .
Then say the hammer and spring mutated into existence .
Combining all three now , we find ourselves with something that can clip several pieces of paper together .
And so it continues until the function of mouse catching comes to be .
Another Behe falsifier is called “ improvements become necessities . ”
Dr. H. Allen
Orr writes :
An irreducibly complex system can be built gradually by adding parts that , while initially just advantageous , become — because of later changes — essential .
The logic is very simple .
Some part ( A ) initially does some job ( and not very well , perhaps ) .
Another part ( B ) later gets added because it helps A . This new part is n’t essential , it merely improves things .
But later on , A ( or something else ) may change in such a way that B now becomes indispensable .
This process continues as further parts get folded into the system .
Dr. Orr helpfully uses this theoretical objection to Behe ’s argument for more concrete purposes when commenting that the creation of lungs from air bladders used to be simply a non-essential improvement for terrestrial exploration .
When organisms grew to be terrestrially bound , however , that improvement became crucial to survival .
This shows how as mutations led away from aquatic life and toward terrestrial existence , what was once an improvement transformed itself into an essentiality , all without design .
Another anti-Behe attack utilized criticizes his argument by analogy as adequate proof for his irreducible complexity theory .
The writers of this site say that Behe essentially argues :
A mousetrap is “ irreducibly complex ” — it requires all of its parts to work properly
A mousetrap is a product of design .
The bacterial flagellum is “ irreducibly complex ” — it requires all of its parts to work properly .
Therefore the flagellum is like a mousetrap .
Therefore the flagellum is a product of design .
This is an example of an inductive argument , and so the conclusion presented is not a certainty ; it is merely very likely if the premises are valid .
But , the comparison is not a strong one because while we know the process by which a mousetrap is designed , as previously stated , we have no such process for how biological things could have been intelligently designed ( again , God is just a means of halting investigation ) .
Besides that possibly fatal flaw , the argument also has a couple of other holes .
For example , Behe does not even attempt to resolve the issue of how the designer was designed .
A designer who created such a wondrous thing as the human eye must be equally or more wondrous himself — and so equally needy of being designed .
In addition , the website explains , " To Behe , a system has evolved when he , or others , can imagine how it has evolved , otherwise it was a product of intelligent design . "
This is clearly insufficient evidence to disprove the theory of evolution , and a rationale that Dr. Richard Dawkins would likely term " the Argument from Personal Incredulity . "
Quite simply , evolution is a slow process of tiny modifications .
Things only become clear in retrospect , so it 's hardly surprising that some products of evolution cannot be picked apart right now .
After all , evolution has occurred for billions of years , but we discovered the phenomenon less than 200 years ago .
Behe wishing for a complete explanation of every evolved structure , even those perhaps still evolving , is blatantly setting evolution up to fail .
The other argument from design I 'll cover in this examination appears at http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/theodore_drange/tuning-revisited.html and is titled " The Fine - Tuning Argument Revisited ( 2000 ) . "
Rather than questioning evolution as a good explanation for how different species developed on Earth , this argument aims to give God a role as the planner of our physical constants .
On this website , Theodore M. Drange writes both the argument and the refutation .
First , he presents the argument from design , quoted here :
( P1 ) The particular group of values that exists for the fundamental physical constants of our universe ( call it " GPC " ) is just one of a huge number of different groups of values , all of which are physically possible ( i.e. , not ruled out by more basic laws ) .
( P2 ) For all , or at least a large number , of the various groups of values mentioned above , the probability of the existence of any particular group is not considerably less than the probability of the existence of GPC itself .
( P3 ) It is not the case that there exist a great many worlds ( or regions of spacetime ) , separated from our observable universe , each with its own group of values for fundamental physical constants .
( C4 ) Therefore [ from P1 , P2 , & P3 ] , the existence of GPC is exceedingly improbable .
( P5 ) GPC is the only group of values for the fundamental physical constants of a world ( or region of spacetime ) that would permit the origin , development , and continuation of life as we know it within that world .
( P6 ) The capability of permitting life as we know it is a very special feature within the set of hypothetical physically possible worlds .
( C7 ) Hence [ from C4 , P5 , & P6 ] , the existence of GPC is remarkable , surprising , and in need of explanation .
( P8 ) Given the truth of ( C7 ) , the hypothesis that GPC was a product of intelligent design ( call it " IDH " ) is the very best explanation there is for the existence of GPC .
( C9 ) It follows that there is good evidence that IDH is true .
On its face , this argument for the truthfulness of Intelligent Design seems valid , in that the premises and earlier conclusions do logically seem to lead to the final conclusion .
That said , it is also an inductive argument ( the inference to the best explanation ) and therefore cannot be sound because it cannot be certainly known .
That , however , is a moot point because Drange skillfully shows how woefully weak this argument is by picking apart several of its premises and therefore nullifying the conclusion .
Drange 's first objection calls P1 into question .
Drange correctly points out that people advocating what he terms " The Fine - Tuning Argument " have yet to prove that physical constants different than what currently exist could ever be .
Drange writes , " It may be that scientists of the future will come up with a [ theory ] that will show why values for physical constants other than [ those currently existing ] are not physically possible . "
Drange does not provide positive evidence for the counterclaim , but simply shows that the premise given has not been proven .
The one proposing the argument bears the burden of proving the premises , not the person raising a doubt .
Next , Drange attacks P2 by saying an Intelligent Design theorist proposing the Fine - Tuning Argument must provide evidence that most of the various possible worlds ( each with differing constants ) have about as much of a chance of existing as our current universe .
If that is n't the case , our current constants are not all that surprising , because the " competition " is improbable .
However , again , this is a moot point because , " Physicists do not have any data on the basis of which such probability computations could be made . "
Therefore , we have no idea whether our constants are less probable , more probable or equally probable as compared to other constants ( themselves questionable in the absence of evidence they are physically possible ) .
The next objection raised skewers P3 by suggesting that many different universes may exist , and so the existence of one with our constants is hardly surprising when taken in that context .
He then extends the criticism , applying it to the claim that life 's presence in this universe is remarkable .
If there are multiple universes " then the fact that we happen to exist in one of the very few worlds capable of sustaining life as we know it would not be ... incapable of being reasonably explained simply by ... chance . "
Again , though there is not solid evidence for the existence of multiple worlds , neither can it be conclusively and self - evidently said that multiple ones do n't exist .
Another fundamental problem with people making this kind of design argument is that they seem to think that since life as we know it could not come to be without specific constants , that those constants necessarily had to be .
This is an unreasonable interpretation of the Anthropic Principle .
Dr. Daniel Dennett explains the reasonable version of that principle as essentially :
It must be the case that if life as we know it depends on specific physical constants , then , since such life exists , the world contains those constants .
This has nothing to do with the necessity of the constants , per se .
Rather , it is simply explaining that , if something is necessary for something else to exist , and that second something does exist , the first something by necessity must .
The unreasonable Anthropic Principle interpretation is fallacious in assuming that life as we know it had to evolve ( thereby making the constants compulsory ) , which is a baseless assumption .
The next stated objection questions whether our universe and its characteristics are special at all ( chipping away at P6 of the argument ) .
If there are other universes with differing physical constants ( a possibility that cannot be ruled out without evidence ) , each one might have fascinating things occurring inside it totally unrelated to life .
Basically , Drange is saying that we are putting too high a value on life by seeming to think nothing else could be more interesting .
Intelligent Design theorists are also falsely leaping to the conclusion that we can even comprehend what might develop in other universes , while Drange argues we can't really know how things would progress .
Drange writes :
And even if it were true that no other possible world , with different values , would have permitted life as we know it , nevertheless , whatever world had come about , it would probably have had some other unique feature (s ) at least as interesting as the property of permitting life as we know it .
From this perspective , there would be nothing special about our universe , and that makes [ the premise ] totally unsupported and thus doubtful .
The final objection relates to the premise that design is the best explanation for our universe ‘s constants .
Though Drange goes on about this for quite a while , I 'll focus on just a few objections here .
First , Drange argues that Intelligent Design is flawed because there is no information about either the designer (s ) or the designing process .
It is essentially a theory comprised of an effect without the benefit of a cause .
He also raises an interesting point in wondering why , if the designer (s ) wished to create an intelligent life form , they created a universe so sparsely populated with life ( which itself took billions of years to evolve and billions more to gain intelligence ) .
And , going back to a Behe problem , Drange wonders where those who designed the universe came from .
Drange considers this " at best , simply replacing one mystery by an even greater mystery . "
APPARENTLY , I ’m an idiot .
Every financial advice columnist seems to be telling me so .
My crime : buying morning coffee from Starbucks for my wife and me .
Avoiding the regular cup of overpriced coffee has become an easy cliché for financial advisers , a symbol of money frittered away .
The advice has appeared just about everywhere .
Drop the caramel mocha frappu - whatever , they say , or you ’ll spend your retirement testing recipes that combine Hamburger Helper and dog food .
David Bach , the author of “ The Automatic Millionaire , ” pushes what he calls the Latte Factor , which he has defined as “ the daily extravagances that drain your resources . ”
Another guru , Paul Farrell , has estimated that skipping Starbucks and compounding the savings could save you an eye - popping $ 500,000 by retirement .
At my own newspaper , Damon Darlin , a financial columnist , has repeatedly brought up this issue .
Before bringing up a point of disagreement — what logicians call the “ Big But ” — it is common to bestow a few compliments to ease the sting .
So , as a preface to the Big But , let me say that Mr. Darlin is a fine journalist and , for all I know , a swell dancer besides .
Still , I disagree .
Buy the damned coffee , if it makes you happy .
When I show up back at the house after dropping off my high schooler in the morning and I have that latte in hand for my wife , she will sometimes refer to me as “ my hero ! ”
After more than 30 years together , this is about the only time I am called that .
Morph of a Nerd CEO - The Power of Silence
Mr. Oak ( not his real name but he values his privacy ) taught me to negotiate .
Needless to say , negotiation is an essential skill for CEOs and it is a valuable one for nerds or anyone else .
In the late 1960s Mr. Oak was the Director of MIS Operations or some such title for a large conglomerate and I was Manager of Systems Programming , my usual nerd job .
Like most big companies we used IBM mainframes .
But we had brought some Other Vendor equipment into our data center in New York both to try it out and to give us some leverage over Big Blue .
Lesson # 1 : leverage is good .
Unfortunately the Other Vendor mainframe did n’t run most of the time and was n’t serviced promptly when it failed .
I could n’t get the attention of anyone but our hapless and powerless account rep at Other Vendor , Inc. and I told Mr. Oak about the problem .
Naturally , Mr. Oak did n’t pay the bill for the equipment that did n’t work .
Lesson # 2 : holding the money is a position of power .
It ’s much weaker to ask for a refund .
High executives from Other Vendor , Inc. requested an urgent meeting and threatened unspecified legal action .
Mr. Oak ignored the threat , waved off all the dates they proposed , and suggested some dates of his own further in the future .
They agreed to one of them .
Lesson # 3 : start winning right away , even on modalities .
Demanding and conceding are habits .
Mr. Oak had me gather all instances of malfunction and shoddy , tardy service in preparation for our meeting .
He turned down my suggestion that we give them this data in advance because , he said , we were n’t having a debate over the past , we wanted what we wanted in concessions in the meeting .
Lesson # 4 : negotiation is not debate .
I had been a very good debater in school .
I was still a very green negotiator .
Also he was not interested in thinking through what they might argue about our occasional failures to call them promptly or to read the documentation or follow instructions .
We must concentrate on arguing our case ; not theirs .
Lesson # 5 : never negotiate with yourself .
“ By the way , what do we want from them ? ” I asked .
“ Money , of course , ” said Mr. Oak , amused at my naiveté .
“ What about better service in the future ? ” I asked .
“ They ’ll promise that anyway , ” said Mr. Oak , “ and they ’re more likely to deliver if they understand that it costs them not to . ”
“ How much ? ” I asked .
“ We need to find out how much authority they have , ” he said .
“ If it ’s too little , we ’ll have to negotiate with someone higher . ”
But he would n’t be more specific than this about his goal .
Lesson # 6 : Know what dimension you want to win in .
In this case it was money but it does n’t have to be .
Lesson # 7 : Do n’t limit your aspiration until you find out what is achievable .
Aim high .
When the executives of Other Vendor , Inc. came in for the meeting , they were shown to a waiting room and plied with diuretics like coffee and tea and made to wait .
You can figure out Lessons # 8 and # 9 easily enough .
Before we went into the meeting half an hour after the appointed time , Mr. Oak surprised me by reminding me to go to the men ’s room ; it had been a long time since even my mother had done that .
He also told me forcibly not to speak except when he asked me a question .
He knew I liked to talk .
“ What if they ask me a direct question ? ” I asked .
“ Either I ’ll answer it or ask you to or not , ” he said .
We did n’t apologize for keeping them waiting .
Mr. Oak did n’t ask how they were hitting them or about their wives and families .
He instructed me to read the list of offences which I did .
When I finished , they started to read the list of our offences which Mr. Oak had n’t let me prepare for .
“ That ’s irrelevant , ” Mr. Oak said .
On his desk under a plastic sheet he kept lists of words .
They were in columns of harsh , strong , and mild .
For example , “ fight ” , “ argue ” , “ discuss ” .
Lesson # 10 : Choose your few words carefully .
“ What ? ” one of them said .
Mr. Oak said nothing .
With difficulty , I said nothing .
“ We are prepared , ” one of them said , “ to give you a credit for the actual time the machine was down . ”
“ We already told you , ” said Mr. Oak , “ that it was worse than useless to us . ”
They waited but he did n’t say anything else .
Finally , the other , higher ranking of them said “ We will credit your whole past bill . ”
“ Then take the machine out , ” said Mr. Oak .
Lesson # 11 : Do n’t counter explicitly until you have to .
“ We will give you three months credit going forward . ”
Silence from Mr. Oak .
They are beginning to squirm as both the silence and their full bladders make them increasingly uncomfortable .
“ Five months .
Tom , do n’t you think that is enough time to evaluate and see that our machine is superior to IBM ? ”
But I had my instructions .
More silence .
We settled at full past credit , nine months future credit , and permanent onsite technical support with almost another computer worth of spare parts .
They hurried out to the men ’s room as soon as they decently could .
Lesson # 12 : There ’s nothing as powerful as silence .
This is the most important lesson I learned that day from Mr. Oak .

Starting as a sole practitioner ;

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
It seemed so obvious at the time , back at the peak of the Internet bubble seven years ago this month .
Profits no longer mattered .
You see , it was different this time .
It was a new paradigm .
Internet companies were changing the world and old measurements of success , such as profitability , did n't apply anymore .
Until of course , they did .
And we 're still living with the fallout from the resulting collapse in Internet stocks and tech stocks in general , seven years later .
The parallel with what 's happening in the mortgage market seems eerily familiar .
In the media , the general rule of thumb is that the next big crisis in the financial markets will come from something totally unexpected .
An earthquake in Japan ( Barings collapse ) ; a plunge in Asian and Russian currencies and debt ( Long - Term Capital Management ) ; a shell game in the executive suite at one of America 's most respected new economy companies ( Enron ) .
The thing about the brewing mortgage debacle , however , is that everyone saw it coming .
They just refused to believe it .
Questions have been asked about risky mortgage loans going back to 2003 .
What would happen to all the leverage taken on by home buyers when interest rates started to rise and the market turned around .
But the answer was always the same .
It 's different this time .
The banks and lenders have sold the loans .
They do n't hold them .
Well , who does ?
The standard answer , seemingly true , was that they 'd all been carved up and sold through various derivative instruments , so the risk was spread over a greater number of investors .
Oh , we all said .
Those derivative markets are so hard to understand .
The big boys like Bear Stearns BSC , - 10.00 % and Lehman Brothers LEH , know how to hedge against this stuff .
And they 'd never pass along bad goods , right ?
So here we are this week at the popping of another great Wall Street myth ; another big con that everybody -- even on the street -- bought into because the money was easy and the returns were great .
It was n't like the media did n't try to do stories looking for signs of a turnaround .
A piece about the prospect for banks , filed by MarketWatch 's own Nick Godt back in September , looks remarkably prescient this week in its description of how the subprime lenders looked vulnerable .
Read full story .
Other media had similar warning stories .
But even the most pessimistic forecasts by people interviewed in these stories were offset by reassurances from the industry that everything was appropriately hedged .
In short , plenty of people worried this might happen but precious few were prepared to bet on it -- until now .
What 's bizarre here is that the revelations of the problems in the mortgage market , caused by overaggressive selling as well as borrowing during the housing boom , are coming the same week as the elite of Wall Street gather to decry the state of financial regulation in this country as too restrictive , what with Sarbanes - Oxley and all that .
Here we are in the middle of another self - induced financial implosion -- in a regulated industry by the way -- and the great minds are telling us that the answer is less regulation .
So just like with the Internet bubble , investors and in this case many home buyers are learning an expensive lesson about boom and bust .
Each day subprime housing loan problems are turning up in new unexpected areas -- General Motors , H&R Block , specific mutual funds tied to real estate .
The list will get larger and more unusual with each passing week .
These bad loans are out there -- and somebody owns them , or pieces of them .
The search is on for who is holding the bag , be it subprime lenders , banks , investors in collateralized debt obligations , or CDOs , investment banks , GM GM , - 2.37 % and H&R Block HRB , +2.46 % , or maybe one of the mutual funds in your 401 ( K ) .
At the end of the day , the horrible reality is that in some way , we all own them .
And it serves us right .

The Mignonette , 1884 ( Queen v. Dudley )
Sixteen hundred miles away from the closest shore their only hope was to get on the main trade route and be picked up by another ship .
However parsimonously rationed , the two tins of turnips were quickly consumed .
Occasional rainfall permitted the men to collect some unsalted water in their oilskins .
Parker , much sicker than the others , quickly ate his rations ; the rest were able to hold out longer .
On the fourth day they spotted a turtle asleep on the water , hauled it on board , and fed on it for nearly a week , even eating the bones and chewing on its leathery skin .
They tried to catch some fish , but with no success .
Their lips and tongues parched and blackened from thirst , they took to drinking their urine .
Eventually Parker and Stephens resorted to drinking seawater , then thought to be certain poison . .
On the nineteenth day , feeling more dead than alive , Dudley proposed that one of them , to be chosen by lots , be killed for the rest to feed on .
Brooks would not hear of it ; Stephens was hesitant , and the idea was temporarily abandoned .
Dudley next tried to persuade Stephens .
He no longer talked about drawing lots .
Parker evidently was the sickest , and he had no wife or children ; it only seemed fair , Dudley reasoned , that he be the one killed .
Finally , Stephens agreed .
Dudley walked over to where Parker lay at the bottom of the boat , his face buried in his arms .
" Richard , " he said in a trembling voice , " your hour has come . "
" What ?
Me , sir ? " mumbled the only half - conscious boy , uncomprehendingly .
" Yes , my boy , " Dudley repeated and then plunged his penknife into Parker 's neck . .
For the next four days all three , including Brooks who had objected to the killing , fed on the young boy 's body , even drinking his blood .
On the twenty - fourth day of their odyssey they were sighted by a German boat , the Montezuma , heading home from South America .
Of the three men , only Brooks was able to clamber aboard ; the rest had to be carried .
Parker 's remains , still in the dinghy , left no doubt about what had happened and both Dudley and Stephens completed the tale as soon as they had recovered sufficiently .
The German crew , however , continued to treat them with the utmost kindness . .
In September the 6th , 1884 , the Montezuma sailed into Falmouth .
The survivors were taken to the Customs House and closely questioned .
It did not occur to them that they had done anything criminal .
Dudley told of their adventure with something resembling gusto and even insisted on keeping the penknife with which he had killed Richard Parker as a memento .
They were stunned when they were put under arrest and charged with murder .
The upright Dudley immediately insisted that he was the ringleader and that Brooks was completely innocent .
Brooks was indeed discharged and became the prosecution 's chief witness . .
Throughout the trial and the preparations preceding it , public sympathy was almost entirely on the side of the " cannibals . "
When Dudley traveled from Falmouth to London to meet his wife at Paddington Station , people took their hats off as he passed .
The trial judge described Dudley as a man of " exemplary courage . "
The mayor of Falmouth was threatened with murder for having arranged the men's arrest .
The prosecutor was similarly threatened , if he obtained a conviction .
And , most remarkably , Daniel Parker , Richard Parker 's eldest brother , forgave Dudley in open court , and even shook hands with him .
Parker 's family planted a tombstone on Richard 's grave that read : .
" Though he slay me , yet I will trust him . "
( Job , xiii , 15 )
Lord , lay not this sin to their charge .
Finally he remarked that a rule permitting the killing of someone in situations of necessity would be virtually unworkable .
" Who is to judge of this sort of necessity ? " he asked .
" By what measure is the comparative value of lives to be measured ? " he continued .
" Is it to be strength , or intellect , or what ? "
The court then sentenced the defendants to death . .
For all its rhetoric the court , however , did not want to be taken too seriously .
A pardon by the home secretary had been arranged in advance , and when it came time to pronounce the death sentence , the judges did not even wear their black hoods as is customary on such occasions . .
The defendants were released from prison six months later .
Brooks had already gone back to sea , but neither Dudley nor Stephens were enamored of the idea .
Stephens settled down near Southampton and apparently supposted himself through odd jobs .
He continued to be absorbed by the events on the dinghy and over time went quietly mad .
Thomas Dudley emigrated to Sydney , Australia , where he became a small shopkeeper and managed to keep his past history a secret .
He too was haunted , however , by memories of the dinghy , which according to one report , he tried to relieve by great quantities of opium .
He died as the first victim of the bubonbic plague that hit Australia in 1900 .

FAKERY ….
Remember those charges that North Korea was flooding the world with counterfeit U.S. bills laundered through a bank in Macau ?
A recent audit says it ’s not true :
“ From our investigations it is apparent that … the Bank did not introduce counterfeit U.S. currency notes into circulation , ” the Ernst & Young audit said , noting that large cash deposits from North Korea were routinely screened for counterfeits by the Hong Kong branch of an unidentified bank with U.S. operations .
The audit ’s conclusions about the laundering of counterfeit currency are significant because they cast doubt on Bush administration claims that North Korea has engaged in state - sponsored counterfeiting and introducing these fake bills via Banco Delta .
This is a big deal .
On September 19 , 2005 , North Korea finally agreed in principle to abandon its nuclear weapons programs , prompting optimism that the six - party talks might finally be making progress .
In a triumph of timing — maybe deliberate , maybe not — the very next day the Bush administration announced sanctions on the Macau bank , freezing its North Korean assets and causing the always prickly North Koreans to assume the U.S. was acting in bad faith .
Shortly thereafter they walked out of the talks , and a year later announced that they had tested a nuclear weapon .
Now we find out that the charges were probably unfounded .
Just like we found out in February that the original charges in 2002 that North Korea was pursuing uranium enrichment might not have been true either .
Just another example of the Bush administration doing its best to bring our credibility down to the level of the most batshit insane regime on earth .
Good job , guys .
The Top Reasons Users Call The IT Help Desk
SupportSoft 's evaluation covered about 2 million call logs for 20 large global companies .
Forget any of your passwords lately ?
If so , you 've got plenty of company .
Together , password trouble -- and four other problem areas -- contribute to 75 % of the calls corporate help desks get , according to a new study released by SupportSoft , a provider of technology - glitch automation software .
For its " IT Headache Index , " SupportSoft evaluated about 2 million call logs for 20 large global companies .
SupportSoft has been analyzing corporate call logs quarterly for the last two years , but this is the first time it has made its findings public , says James Morehead , company 's VP of product marketing .
Password problems , including the need to reset them , make up a fifth of the calls corporate IT help desks get .
" The number of different passwords needed to get work done is staggering , " says Morehead .
The other top reasons for calling the help desk include systems issues , such as hardware failures , which make up 16 % of calls ; enterprise software problems , such as trouble accessing ERP ( Enterprise Resource Planning ) applications , which also contribute to 16 % of the trouble ; connectivity issues , like trouble accessing a VPN or virtual private network causes 12 % of problems ; and e-mail complaints -- like being unable to open a message , are responsible for 11 % of the calls .
The other remaining reasons users cry uncle include an assortment of trouble , including slow - running PCs and printer problems .
Looking ahead , Morehead predicts deployments of Microsoft 's Vista will become a new reason for users to seek out help .

The Magnificent Tail of Comet McNaught
Credit & Copyright : Robert H. McNaught
Explanation : Comet McNaught , the Great Comet of 2007 , has grown a long and filamentary tail .
The spectacular tail spreads across the sky and is visible to Southern Hemisphere observers just after sunset .
The head of the comet remains quite bright and easily visible to even city observers without any optical aide .
The amazing tail is visible on long exposures and even to the unaided eye from a dark location .
Reports even have the tail visible just above the horizon after sunset for many northern observers as well .
Comet McNaught , estimated at magnitude - 2 ( minus two ) , was caught by the comet 's discoverer in the above image just after sunset last Friday from Siding Spring Observatory in Australia .
Comet McNaught , the brightest comet in decades , is now fading as it moves further into southern skies and away from the Sun and Earth .
Video : NBA legend with political aspirations , Charles Barkley : ' It 's an easy call .
We 've got to get out of Iraq . '
David Edwards and Josh Catone
Published : Wednesday February 21 , 2007 Print This Email This NBA Hall of Fame player , Charles Barkley announced his intentions last July to run for Governor of Alabama , perhaps in 2010 .
" I was a Republican until they lost their minds , " said Barkley at the time .
In a talk with Wolf Blitzer on CNN this afternoon , Barkley may have begun to sketch out a platform on which to launch his political career .
" I want to be a politician , " Barkley said .
" I think I understand how the system works , I think a lot of politicians are corrupt , and it's about time we put some people in there who are going to look out for the majority of the people instead of the rich people . "
When asked about the war in Iraq , Barkley replied that the situation was simple , " It 's an easy call for me .
We 've got to get out of Iraq .
[ Saddam Hussein ] is dead .
That situation has n't gotten better .
So , anything that the Republicans say about the war in Iraq -- it 's just bogus .
I mean , it 's a terrible situation .
We 've got a lot of innocent kids getting killed over there , and we 're never going to be safe over there . "
Classifying himself as an Independent , Barkley told Blitzer , " I think the Republicans are terrible , and the Democrats are not much better .
...
But I think the Republicans have took the country in a terrible situation .
And let 's get one thing straight about the last elections : the Democrats did not win , they won because the other team was n't any good .
They 've got to get their act together , because this country right now is in serious , serious turmoil . "
IF YOU have ever sat alone in a bar , depressed by how good - looking everybody else seems to be , take comfort — it may be evolution playing a trick on you .
A study just published in Evolution and Human Behavior by Sarah Hill , a psychologist at the University of Texas , Austin , shows that people of both sexes reckon the sexual competition they face is stronger than it really is .
She thinks that is useful : it makes people try harder to attract or keep a mate .
Dr Hill showed heterosexual men and women photographs of people .
She asked them to rate both how attractive those of their own sex would be to the opposite sex , and how attractive the members of the opposite sex were .
She then compared the scores for the former with the scores for the latter , seen from the other side .
Men thought that the men they were shown were more attractive to women than they really were , and women thought the same of the women .
Dr Hill had predicted this outcome , thanks to error - management theory — the idea that when people ( or , indeed , other animals ) make errors of judgment , they tend to make the error that is least costly .
The notion was first proposed by Martie Haselton and David Buss , two of Dr Hill 's colleagues , to explain a puzzling quirk in male psychology .
As studies show , and many women will attest , men tend to misinterpret innocent friendliness as a sign that women are sexually interested in them .
Dr Haselton and Dr Buss reasoned that men who are trying to decide if a woman is interested sexually can err in one of two ways .
They can mistakenly believe that she is not interested , in which case they will not bother trying to have sex with her ; or they can mistakenly believe she is interested , try , and be rejected .
From an evolutionary standpoint , trying and being rejected comes at little cost , except for hurt feelings .
Not trying at all , by contrast , may mean the loss of an opportunity to , among other things , spread one 's DNA .
There is an opposite bias in women 's errors .
They tend to undervalue signs that a man is interested in a committed relationship .
That , the idea goes , is because a woman who guesses wrongly that a man intends to stick around could end up raising a child alone .
On looks , however , men and women make the same error .
So go on , pluck up your courage : you may think the competition is frighteningly hot , but then so does she .
JERUSALEM — Israel has appointed a top general to oversee a war against Iran , prompting speculation that it is preparing for possible military action against Tehran ’s nuclear program .
Maj . Gen. Elyezer Shkedy , Israel ’s air force chief , will be overall commander for the “ Iran front , ” military sources told the London Sunday Telegraph .
News of the appointment comes just days before a United Nations deadline expires for Iran to give up its nuclear program , which Western governments fear will be used to produce atomic weapons .
Despite Iran ’s offer last week to engage in “ serious talks ” on the matter , Israel fears even more than other Western nations that the offer is simply to buy time for Tehran to secure all the technology it needs to build the bomb .
“ Israel is becoming extremely concerned now with what they see as Iran ’s delaying tactics , ” said Israeli Iran analyst Meir Javedanfar .
“ [ The planners ] think negotiations are going nowhere , and Iran is becoming a major danger for Israel .
Now they are getting ready for living with a nuclear Iran or letting the military take care of it . ”
The prospect of Israel “ living with ” a nuclear Iran appears remote .
Last week , Giora Eiland , Israel ’s former national security adviser , told reporters that Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad would “ sacrifice half of Iran for the sake of eliminating Israel . ”
Mr. Ahmadinejad “ has a religious conviction that Israel ’s demise is essential to the restoration of Muslim glory , that the Zionist thorn in the heart of the Islamic nations must be removed , ” Mr. Eiland said .
Gen .
Shkedy , who was appointed to the role two months ago , will coordinate intelligence gathered by Israel ’s foreign spy agency Mossad and military sources , in order to draw up battle plans .
Then , during any war with Iran , he will command the campaign from a “ hot seat ” in the Israeli army ’s headquarters in Tel Aviv .
“ It ’s natural that Shkedy is nominated to this role , because the air force is Israel ’s only force that can reach and sustain a military operation against Iran , ” said Uri Dromi , a former air force colonel and military analyst .
“ Everyone is playing with dates and time frames , but the list of options is becoming shorter , ” he added .
“ I think we have one year open [ to launch military action ] .
Israel will have to decide . ”
Officially , Israel stresses that it does not want to take the lead in tackling Iran and that a massive campaign of air strikes would be best led by the United States , which has forces in Iraq that are much closer to Iranian targets .
Gen .
Shkedy ’s appointment to the Iran command role was made by Israel ’s chief of staff , Lt. Gen .
Dan Halutz , in the run-up to this summer ’s Lebanon war but emerged only last week .
Gen .
Shkedy , 49 , is the son of Holocaust survivors and has a picture in his office of an Israeli F - 15 flying over Auschwitz .
The father of three makes no bones about the Iranian threat to Israel .
“ Ahmadinejad is trying with all his might to reach a nuclear capability .
There ’s no argument about his intentions , ” he said in an interview two months ago , about the time of his appointment .
“ This … nuclear weaponry can come to constitute an existential threat to Israel and the rest of the world .
My job is to maximize our capabilities in every respect .
Beyond that , in this case , the less said the better . ”

Anais Nin's Collage Technique
" The role of a writer is not to say what we all can say , but what we are unable to say . "
In a lot of places , the dirt often “ cracks horrendously , ” said Bill Steen , a natural builder in Elgin , Ariz . , because “ they just pound it into place . ”
Mr. Steen and his wife , Athena Swentzell Steen , have led an effort to modernize the techniques , adding sand and fiber in carefully calibrated amounts to control cracking .
Mr. Steen , 59 , is half Mexican and grew up in an adobe house in Tucson with earthen patios .
Ms. Swentzell Steen , 45 , who is half Pueblo Indian , grew up in adobe houses in Santa Fe. , N.M.
“ When you grow up and you ’re living in a house that ’s got three - foot adobe walls , that stuff just imprints on you . ”
Mr. Steen said .
“ We kept thinking about the materials , the clay , ” he added .
“ We decided to refine that recipe and make a floor that was crack - free , solid and really serviceable . ”
( Mr. Steen ’s instructional pamphlet , “ Earthen Floors , ” is something of a bible to natural builders ; it is out of print , but he said an updated version would be available on the couple ’s Web site , caneloproject.com , within a few months . )
“ There ’s all sorts of recipes ” for the floors , Mr. Steen said .
“ There ’s no one way to do it . ”
In fact , no firm standards seem to exist .
Michelle Moore , a vice president of the United States Green Building Council , a nonprofit industry group in Washington that sets standards for pro-environment construction , said that its guidelines do n’t even mention earthen floors or natural building .
She said , however : “ We envision a future where all buildings are green .
Natural building techniques are an important part of that , but they ’re not the only approach . ”
And Steven Moore , director of the graduate program in sustainable design in the architecture school of the University of Texas at Austin , said that such building techniques “ are not part of the program at all . ”
For natural builders , the most practical benefit of earthen floors is thermal .
( The high density and low thermal conductivity of an earthen floor allows it to capture and retain warmth . )
Some builders install radiant heating systems in their floors , which circulate hot water and reduce the need for conventional heating .
And when the floor receives direct sunlight it can act as a passive solar device , absorbing heat during the day and releasing it at night .
At the moment , the floors are more popular in the West than elsewhere .
“ The East Coast tends to be much more conservative , ” said Mary Golden , a builder in Rochester who has contracts to install two earthen floors this summer and already has one in her own home .
“ And it ’s inertia .
They came out of the Southwest , and they ’re taking their time moving across the country . ”

Economics reporter , BBC News , Detroit Motor Show
Many US firms are predicting that demand for bigger cars will pick up
Chrysler 's chief economist Van Jolissaint has attacked European attitudes to global warming , describing climate change as " way , way in the future , with a high degree of uncertainty " .
He was particularly critical of the recent Stern Report on climate change , which was commissioned by the UK government and calls for urgent action to tackle the problem .
His words are in sharp contrast to the green image that the US car companies have been trying to promote at this year 's Detroit motor show .
Mr Jolissaint was speaking at a private breakfast where the chief economists of the " Big Three " US car firms presented their forecasts for auto industry sales this year .
Most of the audience - which was mainly made up of parts suppliers - seemed to nod in agreement with Mr Jolissaint .
Uncertain magnitude
Mr Jolissaint , a Chrysler veteran who was recently appointed the chief economist for the German - US DaimlerChrysler Group , said that since he started spending more time at the company 's corporate headquarters in Stuttgart he had been surprised by European attitudes towards global warming .
In response to a question from the floor , he said that global warming was a far - off risk whose magnitude was uncertain .
He said that from an economic point of view , it would be more rational to spend lots of money on today 's other big problems , and only make small and limited changes in policies relating to global warming , such as a slight increase in gasoline or carbon taxes .
Airlines and factories are being urged to help cut global warming
Mr Jolissaint said the report , written by a former adviser to UK Chancellor Gordon Brown , was based on dubious economics and did not include a discount rate .
Until recently Sir Nicholas Stern was the second permanent secretary at the UK Treasury .
Chrysler 's chief economist said his German colleagues at DaimlerChrysler 's headquarters in Stuttgart and other professionals in Europe viewed global warming " with much more alarm than we do " .
He called on Europeans to deal with climate change " in a step - by - step , rational way , and not play much Chicken Little " , referring to the US children 's story in which Chicken Little runs around in circles saying " the sky is falling " .
If nothing else , Mr Jolissaint 's remarks illustrate the yawning gap between mainstream opinion on climate change among the educated elites of Europe and America .
But they are also consistent with the cynical view held by some in the US environmental lobby that announcements by car companies about the future development of green vehicles are nothing more than window dressing .
A spokesman for DaimlerChrysler told BBC
News that while the science of climate change remained " uncertain " , the company supported " concurrent advances in climate science to ensure fuller understanding of the controversies surrounding this issue and to avoid inappropriate responses by government or the private sector " .
The company was " committed to develop new advanced technologies to minimise any potential impact our vehicles might have on global climate or the environment in general , " he said .
Bigger cars ?
On Sunday , GM boss Rick Wagoner told the world 's press that there was " now an irrefutable business case for producing green cars " and that the company recognised that fossil fuels would eventually run out , or be in such short supply as to force prices much higher .
At the same time , GM 's chief economist - who last year forecast that oil prices would average $ 40 a barrel when in fact they topped $ 60 - was predicting that oil prices would fall this year as new oil supply came on stream .
Will a drop in the price of oil boost demand for larger vehicles ?
Despite the fact that the chief economists have not forecast growth in US vehicle sales in 2007 , after 16.5 million units were sold in 2006 , they were more optimistic about their outlook than many Wall Street analysts .
One reason for their relative optimism was a remarkably sanguine view of the other economic risks facing the auto industry .
There is widespread agreement that the US economy will slow next year , partly because of a sharp drop in house prices .
But Ford 's chief economist , Ellen Hughes - Cromwick , said there was little to link house prices and auto sales .
She also argued that the US central bank , the Federal Reserve , was likely to cut US interest rates by half a percentage point in coming months to prevent the US economic slowdown turning into a full - blown recession .
This has not been the consensus view in financial markets , and in fact many analysts have stated that Ford would suffer most if the US economic slowdown was more severe than expected .
And some , such as Sean McAlinden of the Center for Automotive Research , have warned that it could even push Ford close to bankruptcy .
Would the fountain of your mind were clear again , that I might water an ass at it .

The incident was a shocking end to the war for journalists
Judge Santiago Pedraz issued the warrant for Sgt Shawn Gibson , Capt Philip Wolford and Lt Col Philip de Camp , of the US 3rd Infantry Division .
Jose Couso , of Spanish TV network Telecinco , died in April 2003 when a US tank fired on the Palestine Hotel .
Reuters news agency cameraman Taras Protsyuk , a Ukrainian , was also killed .
The National Court agreed to consider filing criminal charges against three members of the tank crew two years ago , acting on a request from Mr Couso 's family .
' No co-operation '
Speaking on Wednesday , the judge said he had issued the arrest order because of a lack of judicial co-operation from the US in the case .
The family of Mr Couso said they were delighted at the news , and that they now hoped justice would be done .
US officials say the tank crew believed they were being shot at when they opened fire , although TV footage of the incident did not record any incoming fire .
The incident was witnessed on TV around the world on the day before the fall of the regime of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein , as the Palestine was the base for almost all the foreign media crews in Baghdad .
Earlier on the same day , a correspondent for the Arabic TV broadcaster al - Jazeera was killed when US missiles hit the network 's office in Baghdad .
Following the incident , then - US Secretary of State Colin Powell said a US review of the incident had found the use of force was justified .
Stock markets in the United States have been setting records lately , despite economic conditions that hardly seem like a recipe for boom times on Wall Street .
Gasoline has jumped above $ 3 a gallon in price , yet the Dow Jones Industrial Average recently pushed above 13000 for the first time in its history .
Economic activity in the US is slowing , due in part to a housing - market slump , yet the Standard & Poor 's 500 index is flirting with its historic high of 1527.46 set in 2000 .
What gives ?
How far can this stock market go ?
One explanation for the bullish performance could be that Wall Street is misreading an economy that faces trouble on several fronts .
That would be bad news for future profits .
But other explanations are more prevalent among financial professionals .
Two factors in particular stand out : strong conditions beyond US borders and a merger binge that is pushing up share prices of target companies .
" A lot of major companies have done very well with their overseas markets , " says Robert Carey , chief investment officer at First Trust Advisors , an investment firm in Lisle , Ill .
" The distinction between US companies and foreign companies is getting very hard to draw . "
Companies like IBM , Coca - Cola , and Intel – all among the 30 in the Dow Jones Industrial Average – derive well over half their revenue stream from overseas .
In the final quarter of 2006 , US - based corporations saw the earnings of their foreign affiliates surge to an annualized level of $ 272 billion , up 38 percent from the pace in the fourth quarter of 2005 .
That amounts to about 15 percent of all US corporate profits , as measured by the US Commerce Department .
Emerging markets such as China are a key source of growth for American corporations .
But lately , US exports have also been aided by a stronger economy in Europe , where more than half of those foreign - affiliate profits come from .
Record profits , meanwhile , give corporations and investors lots of money to invest .
Many companies are buying back some of their own outstanding shares , a tactic for returning profits to shareholders .
Others are using the money as fuel for takeovers .
The merger wave has buoyed share prices in the US and beyond .
Media companies such as Dow Jones and Yahoo are among the stocks that have surged early this month on rumors of possible acquisition ( by News Corp. and Microsoft , respectively ) .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , speaking on May 3 to students at the Harvard Business School in Boston , called the past three years " a global economy that 's as strong as anything I 've seen in my business career . "
For now , the good times for American businesses are rolling along , even though forecasters agree that the rate of profit growth is slowing from double - digit rates .
Mr. Carey is in the upbeat camp of investing strategists who think the stock rally has room to run this year – with the Dow reaching 14000 by year - end in a First Trust Advisors forecast .
" The issue is profits , " he says .
" This quarter has been a complete shock to a lot of people , " as earnings handily beat expectations .
The share price for the S&P index is now about 16 times the earnings for its 500 companies , Carey says .
That does n't qualify as cheap on Wall Street .
But " it 's a pretty reasonable multiple , " he says .
Certainly , it reflects a more balanced investor mood than existed in early 2000 , just before the dotcom stock bubble burst , which helped set the stage for a wider sell - off .
But if some analysts see the Dow heading from 13000 to 14000 and beyond this year , many also say it could be a volatile ride .
Some say it 's a good time to remember an old adage on Wall Street : " Sell in May and go away . "
Historically , the period from May through October has been less favorable for share prices than the winter - to - spring period .
Already , the Dow has had a strong run-up this year .
The widely watched index of large US firms traversed from 12000 to 13000 in just 126 days , hitting the new milestone on April 25 .
In trading Monday morning , the Dow stood near 13300 , while the S&P 500 index was a bit above 1500 .
Risks loom ahead on several fronts .
One debate on Wall Street is how long the tide of profits from overseas – and the merger boom – will continue .
The rest of the world is n't immune from a slowdown in the US , which remains the globe 's largest economy and biggest importer of goods .
In addition , the large cash pools that are driving corporate mergers could dwindle if economic conditions turn for the worse .
For now , most economic forecasters see no recession looming for the US , despite the housing - market head winds .
Yet some of the best - performing stocks recently have been companies that typically do well during slowdowns – relatively " safe " industries such as healthcare , utilities , and telecommunications , according to economists at Merrill Lynch .
" We are due for a [ downward stock market ] correction , but there 's no way of knowing when that might be due , " says Michael Cosgrove , who publishes the Econoclast , a market newsletter based in Dallas .
He expects stocks to generally post returns of 6 to 8 percent annually over the next several years , but with downs as well as ups along the way .
Inflation , and the threat of new government policies that restrict trade or raise taxes , are among the risks to shares prices , he says .
Another economist who tracks the markets , David Ranson , says recent highs in the price of gold – above $ 690 an ounce – are an indicator of more inflation on the way .
This is a question widely debated among economists , and a key topic for Federal Reserve policymakers as they meet in Washington this week .
If inflation persists even as the economy slows , that could push up interest rates , making life tougher for corporations that now enjoy a low cost of capital .
Still , Mr. Ranson , who heads H.C. Wainwright & Co. , Economics in Hamilton , Mass. , expects US stocks to end the year modestly higher than they are today .
THE CURRENT fad for teaching Chinese to secondary school pupils is not just remarkably unrealistic ( even at university age , it takes a year or two of hard slogging to read and write good Mandarin , and if you do not regularly use it , it quickly grows rusty ) .
It is also throwing up some interesting cross-cultural issues , as Chinese teachers encounter their first classrooms full of European adolescents .
The French newspaper , Le Figaro , reports this morning how three French cities are either using or preparing to use a " survival kit " for Chinese language teachers , most of whom are Chinese - born or Chinese nationals , and who are " going through Hell " as they struggle to keep order , to quote one education boss from the city of Rennes .
Numbers of French pupils applying to study Chinese rose by 30 % this year , and nationally 20,000 teenagers will be embarking on their first steps with putonghua this autumn .
Top piece of advice in the survival kits ?
Guidance on how European adolescents differ from those in Asia .
" Your class will be filled with pupils of differing ability : appearing to be the best will be a source of shame to them , and they think exploring how far they can push an adult is funny , " the French guide suggests .

BBC News , Tehran
Men also are subject to scrutiny over their clothing
The move is part of an unusually fierce crackdown on what is known locally as bad hijab , or un-Islamic clothing , that this year is also targeting men .
Hair stylists have been warned that they could lose their licences if they do not comply .
However , police have denied a report that they have ordered barbers not to serve customers wearing ties .
Wild
Police say that as well as avoiding Western hairstyles and make up , barbers should not pluck customers ' eyebrows .
Some young boys in Iran sport very wild hair styles , using gel to make their long hair stand on end in a fashion not seen in other countries .
Meanwhile newspapers in Iran have quoted the police as saying that 16,000 women and 500 men have been cautioned in the last week over their improper clothing .
It is not clear if these figures are nationwide or only apply to the capital , Tehran .
Iranian television has said the crackdown on un-Islamic clothing has entered its second phase now where mobile police units will patrol Tehran to look for those who are not observing Islamic dress properly .
According to the local media , Tehran 's public prosecutor has suggested women who violate dress rules should be exiled from the capital to remote areas of the country .
A member of the parliament 's legal committee has said there is no legal impediment to doing this .

PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION ( London : Butterworths , 1979 )
The major change in the second edition of this book is the addition of a new chapter on probabilistic retrieval .
This chapter has been included because I think this is one of the most interesting and active areas of research in information retrieval .
There are still many problems to be solved so I hope that this particular chapter will be of some help to those who want to advance the state of knowledge in this area .
All the other chapters have been updated by including some of the more recent work on the topics covered .
In preparing this new edition I have benefited from discussions with Bruce Croft , David Harper , Stephen Robertson and Karen Sparck Jones .
I am grateful to the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory for providing me with the facilities for carrying out the work .
Finally , I am indebted to the Royal Society for supporting me on their Scientific Information Research Fellowship .
PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION ( London : Butterworths , 1975 )
The material of this book is aimed at advanced undergraduate information ( or computer ) science students , postgraduate library science students , and research workers in the field of IR .
Some of the chapters , particular chapter 6 ( this became chapter 7 in the second edition ) , make simple use of a little advanced mathematics .
However , the necessary mathematical tools can be easily mastered from numerous mathematical texts that now exist and , in any case , references have been given where the mathematics occur .
I had to face the problem of balancing clarity of exposition with density of references .
I was tempted to give large numbers of references but was afraid they would have destroyed the continuity of the text .
I have tried to steer a middle course and not compete with the Annual Review of Information Science and Technology .
Normally one is encouraged to cite only works that have been published in some readily accessible form , such as a book or periodical .
Unfortunately , much of the interesting work in IR is contained in technical reports and Ph.D. theses .
For example , most the work done on the SMART system at Cornell is available only in reports .
Luckily many of these are now available through the National Technical Information Service ( U.S. ) and University Microfilms ( U.K. ) .
I have not avoided using these sources although if the same material is accessible more readily in some other form I have given it preference .
I should like to acknowledge my considerable debt to many people and institutions that have helped me .
Let me say first that they are responsible for many of the ideas in this book but that only I wish to be held responsible .
My greatest debt is to Karen Sparck Jones who taught me to research information retrieval as an experimental science .
Nick Jardine and Robin Sibson taught me about the theory of automatic classification .
Cyril Cleverdon is responsible for forcing me to think about evaluation .
Mike Keen helped by providing data .
Gerry Salton has influenced my thinking about IR considerably , mainly through his published work .
Ken Moody had the knack of bailing me out when the going was rough and encouraging me to continue experimenting .
Juliet Gundry is responsible for making the text more readable and clear .
Bruce Croft , who read the final draft , made many useful comments .
Ness Barry takes all the credit for preparing the manuscript .
Finally , I am grateful to the Office of Scientific and Technical Information for funding most the early experimental work on which the book is based ; to the King ;s College Research Centre for providing me with an environment in which I could think , and to the Department of Information Science at Monash University for providing me with the facilities for writing .

First Chapter : Introduction
Two classic car collectors from the US state of Idaho found the wallet after it fell out of the back of a vintage car they were planning to restore .
After an internet search they found and contacted the owner , Glenn Goodlove .
Mr Goodlove said he probably lost the wallet in the back seat of his 1946 Hudson car while kissing a girl when he was home on leave from the US Navy .
" If it was in my sailor - mentality years , I might have attempted to , as they said in those years , ' make out , " ' Mr Goodlove told the Idaho Twin Falls Times - News .
Vital clues
Jon Beck , 61 , and Chuck Merrill , 72 , bought the now - vintage vehicle in Idaho after placing an ad in a local newspaper to buy a classic car in need of restoration .
Like a couple of kids , we thought we had a goldmine
Jon Beck
Classic car collector
Since 1952 , the car had travelled from Washington state , where Mr Goodlove 's grandfather owned it , to finish up neglected in Idaho , changing hands several times en route .
Driving the car home after buying it , the collectors stopped at a restaurant and saw something had dislodged below the back seat .
" Like a couple of kids , we thought we had a goldmine , " Mr Beck said .
Instead , they found some small change - the leather wallet held a $ 10 bill , Mr Goodlove 's military ID , his Social Security card , his driver 's licence and several jewellery receipts from 1952 .
But they were all in the name of Glenn Putnam .
After searching online , Mr Beck discovered that Mr Putnam had since changed his name to Glenn Goodlove and moved to San Diego , California .
He called Mr Goodlove , asking to speak to a man who used to drive a ' 46 Hudson .
" There was a silence for about 15 seconds , " Mr Beck told the Twin Falls Times - News .
" Then he said , ' Who is this ? " '
Mr Goodlove , now 75 , says he did not even remember losing the wallet , but the find has brought memories of his youth in Everett , Washington , flooding back .
" I could see the house and the car and the town and all the good stuff from living there , " he said .
" They 've been flowing ever since he talked to me . "
Mr Beck and Mr Merrill will post the wallet back to Mr Goodlove .

I Need Smart RSS
by Bruce Eckel
April 6 , 2007
Summary
I 've come to rely on other people rather than RSS feeds to point out the really important stuff to me .
Advertisement
I stopped watching TV news and reading newspapers years ago , and am much happier for it .
And I do n't feel terribly uninformed .
If some non -infotanment thing happens , someone always seems to tell me about it , so I find out .
Or I 'll occasionally watch John Stewart and he brings me up to speed without being too awfully serious about it .
I tried RSS from both ends and found it a necessary idea but a bad implementation .
Necessary because it 's helpful to know that something useful has appeared on the internet .
Notice I say " that " something has appeared , rather than " when " it has appeared , and the " when " is part of the reason I turned off the RSS feeds .
It became another form of noise , interrupting my thought process and throwing me out of the flow .
Yes , there are all kinds of adjustments you can make so your RSS reader is n't popping things up all the time .
I know that , but the general problem is noise .
Having something that goes out and collects everything is like subscribing to the New Yorker .
They just pile up and give you yet another task to accomplish , most of which is wading through yet more accumulated cruft trying to figure out what 's important so you can read that .
And as much as we try to say " it 's not that hard to skim , " in my experience it takes a remarkeable amount of mental energy to do the wading , and I seem to have a lot more in reserve to focus on the real thing when my informal network of filter - people ( usually folks who have come to conferences and workshops ) do it for me .
The other reason RSS is a bad implementation -- but in the current world , the only type of implementation that is practical -- is that what we really want is a " publish - subscribe " mechanism .
You only really need to be told once that a new article is posted .
But you do n't want to give me your identity , because I might abuse it .
So instead of a simple publish - subscribe , RSS is a constant - checking mechanism , which is so inefficient that it might be second only to porn in sucking down bandwidth on the Internet .
That 's just conjecture , but my experience of writing my own RSS feeder was that it rapidly hammered my web site so much that my ISP started charging me significantly more money .
This is why intermediate feed services appeared , but of course those feed services must then handle the traffic .
If RSS had been given any serious thought when it was designed , the feed provider would have been given control over the number of visits the reader could have .
Maybe I can't know your information , but I should be able to throttle the amount of hammering you 're doing on my site .
It all comes down to noise .
RSS gives me as a consumer way too much noise , and it inflicts the provider with too much noise .
It might be considered a kind of agile solution because of the way that it was created -- quick and simple -- but that 's not all there is to agility .
Agility is also , and possibly most importantly , about improving the implementation as new information is acquired .
To me , agility means you are always in the midst of an ongoing experiment .
Because of its static nature , RSS is really a Web 1.0 technology .
There 's no way for the community at large to add information .
Because of this , RSS pours more noise into your world .
What I need is something that only gives me the right information , for me .
This is something I would be more than happy to pay for ; enthusiastic , even .
I 'm not sure that I would need to pay for it , or if that would be the right solution -- especially because it might end up being payment per good article and whoever was being paid would then have incentive to push more articles at me in hopes of getting more money .
A better solution might be something that combines the approach of Pandora.com with a friend list .
Pandora allows you to select music you like from general categories , and when they play songs you do or do n't like , you give feedback and the mechanism theoretically gets better and better at predicting what you want to hear .
Things like Digg have touched on this but they are producing a mass vote , not a customized preference .
I do n't really want to read what gets the highest votes .
I want to read what is important to me , not to the largest number of people that happen to be interested in voting on articles .
So we need an inversion of control , where it 's not about " most popular " but rather about " most appropriate . "
And it constantly improves the way it defines what this means .
That , of course , continually narrows the selection , which is desirable but can become too narrow .
That 's where the " friends " mechanism comes in .
If I have a pool of friends and we can throw suggestions into that pool , this will help discover new potential interesting material .
If one friend tends to throw in things that are too noisy , I can quietly block that person out without them knowing about it .
They might still be making valuable contributions to others in the pool but if those contributions do n't work for me then I can tune them out .
This design could be the next newspaper , the one that the futurists have been promising for awhile : the customized newspaper where you only have articles that are good for you .
Of course , most of the futurists could n't see how this was going to happen and so they assumed the current newspaper organizations would build these papers for you .
In general I think this is still unlikely , mostly because newspapers are too stuck in the way they do things right now .
However , I could still imagine a design like the one I describe above being the thing that saves newspapers , precisely because I would be willing to pay for it .
It provides a valuable enough service for me .
And if there were traditional newspaper columnists that I felt were valuable and informative , I think I 'd be willing to pay for those as well -- of course , that would probably inevitably extend to " regular " bloggers , especially when micropayment systems finally get sorted out .

BBC News , Damascus
Islamic militants forced Selwan to jump into a bonfire
They claim that Islamic extremists in Iraq are trying to wipe them out through forced conversions , rape and murder .
The Mandaeans are pacifists , followers of Adam , Noah and John the Baptist .
They have lived in what is now Iraq since before Islam and Christianity .
More than 80 % have been forced to flee the country and now live as refugees in Syria and Jordan .
Even there they do not feel safe - but they say western governments are unwilling to take them in .
Victim voices
There are thought to be fewer than 70,000 of the Sabian Mandaeans spread across the world - only 5,000 are left in Iraq .
Mazen 's legs are peppered with machine gun wounds
Nine - year - old Selwan likes watching cartoons and playing football .
But he is too scared to leave his flat .
The other children tease him .
He has burns all down the side of his face and on 20 % of his body .
He was kidnapped by Islamic militants who forced him to jump into a bonfire - because he is Mandaean .
Now his family lives in a tiny flat in a slum in Damascus .
I meet Luay .
He is too scared to be identified and does not want to use his full name .
He was dragged off the street by armed men and forcibly circumcised - a practice not allowed in the Mandaean religion .
He is 19 and is now unlikely ever to find a bride from his own faith .
Worse , he was forcibly converted .
That means in the eyes of those same extremists , if he now declares himself Mandaean he is apostate .
To the extremists , that makes him a traitor to Islam , who may be murdered .
He says he will not be safe in any Muslim country .
' Convert or die '
Then there is Enhar , raped by a gang of masked men in front of her husband - because she would not wear a veil .
Our ethnic minority and our ancient religion will die off
Kanzfra Sattar , Mandaean bishop
Mazen used to be a prosperous jeweller .
Now he lives in a cramped flat , with his wife and children .
Water drips through the ceiling .
His legs are peppered with machine - gun wounds , he can barely walk .
Shoaki wears a Manchester United hat and shows me the scars where a gang beat and cut him with a knife - he watched his brother murdered in front of him .
Mandaean elders use words like annihilation and genocide - they believe Islamic militants , both Sunni and Shia , offer them two choices - convert or die .
" Some will not consider us people of the book ... they see us as unbelievers , as a result our killing is allowed , " says Kanzfra Sattar , one of only five Mandaean bishops left worldwide .
' Wait in line '
He believes they are a litmus test for modern Iraq - in a secular state these doctors , engineers and jewellers would thrive .
Kanzfra Sattar is one of only five Mandaean bishops left
In the country as it is without law and in the grip of religious extremism , he fears they will be destroyed .
" We are small in numbers , we ask all the governments of the world to extend a hand of help , " Kanzfra Sattar says .
He says he wants the West to accept his people as refugees .
I ask him what will happen if they do not - he replies simply : " Our ethnic minority and our ancient religion will die off . "
The UN 's refugee agency , the UNHCR , says there may be as many as a million Iraqis who have fled to Syria .
" The numbers that will be resettled are tiny compared to the very large numbers that are here , " says Laurens Jolles , the head of a UNHCR team .
He acknowledges that the Mandaeans will just have to " wait in line " , with other vulnerable groups .
Roughly two million Iraqis have fled to Syria , Jordan and Turkey .
But there are no plans to welcome large numbers to the West .
The US has offered places to 7,000 , while Britain says it will consider every case " on its merits " .
So the Mandaeans wait in line .
Shoaki puts it more simply : " Here , we live in despair . "

Political and social chaos has been with us for a very long time .
Given the revolutions of the past and present , class warfare , and scheming of those seeking power , the human race has shown a remarkable resilience and managed to survive thus far .
The new factors in the equation of the balance of mankind and the rest of nature are the technological advances that have changed how political and social chaos can develop , and the advances in industry that have the potential to inflict serious environmental alterations .
Threats of nuclear war , biological catastrophe , and climate change now bring into question as to how humanity can continue to survive .
Personally , I think that with the growth of true threats to survival , there has been growth of human ingenuity as well .
We have yet to release a Frankenstein 's monster of technology upon the world .
Despite the stockpiles of nuclear weapons , there has been no global warfare .
Medical research is in a renaissance of advance .
Climate change remains a concern , but I believe that we are an adaptable species , as we have adapted before and will again .
The larger question is how will humanity survive , which is what is asked .
It 's very likely that the resources of today may no longer be available in a century .
But consider the resources available today that were not available a century before .
As stated before , we are an adaptable species , and when one window of resources closes , it 's likely that other windows will be openable .
Of course , the speed that everything progresses at has increased .
Will we be able to adapt in time ?
Perhaps not for a lot of us , but consider that in the 14th century , the Black Death wiped out over a third of Europe 's population .
Yet Europe survived and prospered .
We may again have a catastophe that has similarly devestating effects , but I feel confident that after the catastrophe , humankind will prosper .
Why do I place this faith in humanity ?
Because I must .
Without the belief that we will continue to grow and overcome the pains of social chaos as we mature as a species , we might as well not have any faith at all .
I 'm not talking religion ( although that may or may not be a part in its current forms ) , but simply the same belief that we will survive just as much as the sun will rise the next day .
Two posts down it 's clear that Lieberman 's website is n't suffering from a Denial of Service attack .
But now I have the definitive answer as to why Lieberman 's site went down .
They are paying $ 15 / month for hosting at a place called MyHostCamp , with a bandwidth limit of 10 GB .
MyHostCamp is currently down , along with all their clients .
Here 's the deal -- you get what you pay for .
My hosting bill is now over $ 7 K per month .
A smaller site does n't need that much bandwidth , but if you 're paying $ 15 because your $ 12 million campaign is too freakin ' cheap to pay for quality hosting , then do n't go blaming your opponent when your shitty service goes out .
For their part , the Lamont campaign has offered its technical expertise to get Lieberman 's site back up ( which could be done in an hour by a competent sysadmin ) , and has added a link to the googlecached version of Lieberman 's site at the top of their blog .
One side is acting mature , the other is running around making baseless accusations .
Update : Dan Gerstein , Lieberman spokesperson , admits they have no evidence Lamont 's campaign or his supporters are behind their website woes .
I 'm telling you , it 's down because they were too cheap to pay for quality hosting .
That 's a lesson to all of you campaigns skimping on hosting .
$ 15 wo n't cut it .
Update II : Joe 's site shares one server with 73 other sites .
They pay $ 15 / month for an overcrowded server , and then they blame others when it goes down ?
Full list of sites on Joe 's server on the flip .
Update III : From an email :
http://www.meetned.com/
69.56.129.130
http://www.joe2006.com/
69.56.129.130 MeetNed.com - Up .
Joe2006.com - Down .
DoS attacks do n't affect particular accounts on a server .
They bring down the whole server .
The attack site is up , their campaign site is down .
This is n't a DoS attack .
Will the Lieberman campaign reimburse state and federal investigators wasting resources to confirm that the site went down because the campaign was too cheap to hire a quality hosting provider ?

The BBC posted a short photo - spread today that looks at the implosion of four cooling towers at the Chapelcross nuclear power station , in Scotland , where the UK used to produce weapons - grade plutonium .
"
The towers were brought down in 10 seconds , generating an estimated 25,000 tonnes of rubble , " we read I think it 's interesting , though , that the towers seem to crimp and torque in some of these pictures , almost whirling , or folding , down onto themselves like some kind of self - imploding Richard Serra sculpture , made of lead - reinforced concrete .
Might demolition somehow reveal other geometries and architectural forms – otherwise unknown material tendencies held at bay by engineering ?
In loosely related news , meanwhile , I 'm excited to announce that Jeff Byles , author of Rubble : Unearthing the History of Demolition , will now be speaking at Postopolis !
next week – so if you 've got a soft spot for demolition , and the various arguments surrounding it , please stop by !
More speakers to be announced shortly , including an up - to - date schedule .
Iraqi infant mortality soars by 150 percent — a damning revelation of US war crimes
By Bill Van Auken
9 May 2007
The infant mortality rate in Iraq has increased by a shocking 150 percent since 1990 — the highest such increase recorded for any country in the world — according to an annual report issued by the child advocacy group , Save the Children .
According to the report , in 2005 , the last year for which reliable data is available , one in eight Iraqi children — 122,000 in all — died before reaching their fifth birthday .
More than half of these deaths were recorded among new - born infants , with pneumonia and diarrhea claiming the greatest toll among Iraqi babies .
The infant mortality rate has long been considered one of the key measures of societal progress and wellbeing .
The astounding figures recorded in Iraq are an accurate reflection of the social devastation wrought both by the US invasion of 2003 and more than a decade of US - backed economic sanctions that preceded it .
“ Conservative estimates place increases in infant mortality following the 2003 invasion of Iraq at 37 percent , ” according to the Save the Children report .
The implications of such a change — in the space of just two years — are staggering .
Given the steady escalation of the armed conflict in Iraq and the continued deterioration of social conditions for masses of people in the country , the rate of increase in infant and child deaths was no doubt even greater over the course of 2006 .
The report blamed the horrific decline in infant and child health since the invasion on the steadily worsening living conditions for the Iraqi population as a whole , including “ electricity shortages , insufficient clean water , deteriorating health services and soaring inflation . ”
This overall destruction of basic social infrastructure unleashed by the US invasion and occupation has been translated into a horrendous decline in child health .
“ Only 35 percent of Iraqi children are fully immunized , and more than one - fifth ( 21 percent ) are severely or moderately stunted ” as a result of malnutrition , the study found .
The statistics compiled by Save the Children indicate that in 1990 the mortality rate for children under five in Iraq stood at 50 for every 1,000 live births — among the best outcomes reported for the entire Arab world at the time .
In 2005 , the figure was 125 per 1,000 live births — roughly equivalent to the figures recorded in countries like Malawi , Mauritania , Uganda and Haiti .
While some countries — all with one exception in Africa — have higher death rates than Iraq , none came even near the rate of increase in infant mortality recorded by the US - occupied country ( Botswana came closest , with a 107 percent rise , while still recording a slightly lower rate of 120 deaths per 1,000 live births ) .
The destruction of the conditions and very lives of Iraqi children began well before US troops invaded the country in 2003 .
The 1990 - 1991 Gulf
War saw more than 90,000 tons of US bombs and missiles dropped on Iraq , smashing much of its essential infrastructure , including power plants and water and sanitation systems and creating the conditions for a public health disaster .
The war was followed by a decade of punishing sanctions that deprived Iraqi children and the population as a whole of essential medical supplies and adequate nutrition .
Even chlorine , needed to purify water , was embargoed , depriving infants and small children of a clean water supply and condemning many to death .
It was during this period that the United Nations Children ’s Fund ( UNICEF ) estimated that an additional half a million Iraqi children had died between 1991 and 1998 as a result of the sanctions .
In 1998 , the coordinator of United Nation humanitarian operations in Iraq , Denis Halliday , resigned in protest calling the sanctions a form of “ genocide ” and “ a deliberate policy to destroy the people of Iraq . ”
Halliday said at the time , “ We are in the process of destroying an entire society .
It is as simple and terrifying as that .
It is illegal and immoral . ”
President Bill Clinton ’s Secretary of State Madeleine Albright , confronted in a television interview with the UN estimate of 500,000 children having died as a result of the US - backed sanctions , famously answered , “ We think the price is worth it . ”
The rise in infant mortality rates represents the starkest manifestation of the murderous impact that US aggression upon Iraq and its children over a protracted period .
But there are many other indications that for those who survive , conditions of life have become increasingly unbearable .
According to figures reported by the Iraqi government , some 900,000 children have been left orphans by the carnage that has swept Iraq since the US invasion of 2003 .
It is estimated that at the present levels of violence , some 400 children are left orphaned every day in the country .
The Iraqi Ministry of Education , meanwhile , estimates that barely 30 percent the country ’s 3.5 million elementary school children are attending classes , a sharp decline from 75 percent last year .
A study sponsored by the World Health Organization in the Iraqi city of Mosul , found fully 30 percent of school children surveyed suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder .
Significantly , the other country that is presently occupied by the US military and remains the scene of a bitter counterinsurgency war — Afghanistan — ranks as the second worst in the world in terms of its infant mortality rate , with 257 deaths for every 1,000 live births .
In other words , more than one out of four Afghan children dies before the age of five .
On average , every Afghan mother sees two of her children die as infants , while one in six women die in childbirth .
According to the Save the Children study , 40 percent of Afghan children are malnourished and less than half have access to safe water .
The report also notes that , while “ 1 child in 100,000 in the United States dies of pneumonia each year , roughly 1 in 15 ” dies of the disease in Afghanistan .
On a world scale , Save the Children reports , “ Every year , more than 10 million children die before they reach the age of 5 , most from preventable causes and almost all in poor countries . ”
It adds that while infant global infant mortality rates had improved in previous decades , “ rates of progress are slowing and in many countries , child death rates are getting worse . ”
The organization insists that available and low - cost solutions could easily prevent 6 million of these deaths annually .
These include , “ skilled care at childbirth , breastfeeding , measles immunization , oral rehydration therapy for diarrhea and medical care for pneumonia . ”
But for many of the most impoverished countries , and for many others in the most oppressed layers of society elsewhere , these elementary forms of health care and education are not provided .
The statistics included in the report also indicate that the problems of infant mortality reflect the worldwide growth of social inequality , which is literally killing millions of children every year .
“ A child in the poorest fifth of a population is more than twice as likely to die compared to a child from the richest fifth , ” the study finds .
“ Eliminating health - care inequities — and bringing mortality rates among the poorest 80 percent of the population down to those prevailing among the richest 20 percent — would prevent about 4 million of the 10 million deaths each year . ”
In addition to the growing impact of social inequality within each country , the gap between the wealthiest and most impoverished countries has also continued to widen .
While in 1990 , the child mortality rate for sub-Saharan Africa was 20 times higher than for the industrialized countries , by 2005 , the rate was 28 times as high , the study said .

Back in the stone age ( say , about 20 years ago ) we used to have this quaint concept for media we purchased called " fair use . "
I wo n't get into the legal definitions , but it meant in practice that if I had a book , I could read it at home , or I could take it into work and read it there .
In college , I would read novels in the back of boring lectures , and soon hit on the tactic of xeroxing 20 - 30 pages of my book and putting the copies in a folder to disguise what I was doing .
Fortunately , fair use let me do so without penalty .
Sometimes a friend would read an article in a magazine he thought was cool , and he would xerox a copy of the article ( a sample of the magazine , so to speak ) and share it with me .
Increasingly , in the digital age , none of the behaviors are allowed anymore .
For years I used to install my copy of turbo tax on both my home and office computers , and carry my tax file back and forth on a floppy to work on it .
Then , a couple of years ago , Turbo
Tax installed a form of rights management that required that I buy a second copy of the same software for my own personal use for my office .
In effect , I could no longer carry my novel to work -- I had to buy a second copy if I wanted to read it at the office .
The same situation has prevailed with digital music files - increasingly recording companies are taking the position that if you want a digital file on both your iPod and your home system , you need to buy two copies .
And the sampling and sharing we used to do all the time with magazine and newspaper articles are not longer permitted for digital media .
Having firmly established the principle that multiple uses by the same individual of the same digital media should require multiple purchases , where do we go next ?
Well , I think that we will look back on the release of Windows Vista as the next great milestone in killing fair use .
Microsoft may have left out nearly every product enhancement they originally promised for Vista , particularly the revamped file system , and tried to hide the fact with some pretty desktop eye candy , but they found plenty of time to add numerous DRM and copy protection schemes to the OS .
Because , having killed fair use for multiple copies , believe it or not , the media companies are attempting to kill fair use even for the original media by the original buyer !
I know this sounds crazy , but in Windows Vista , media companies are given the opportunity to , in software , study your system , and if they feel that your system is not secure enough , they can downgrade the quality of the media you purchased or simply refuse to have it play .
In other words , you may buy an HD DVD and find that the media refuses to play on your system , not because you tried to copy it , but because it feels like your system * might * be too open .
The burden of proof is effect on the user to prove to the media companies that their system is piracy - proof before the media they paid for will play ( emphasis added ) .
PVP [ a new Vista DRM component ] eliminates these security gaps , enabling a series of DRM measures that keep
a high - resolution content stream encrypted , and in theory completely protected ,
from its source media all the way to the display used to watch it .
If the system
detects a high - resolution output path on a user 's PC ( i.e. , a system capable of
moving high - res content all the way to a user 's display ) , it will check to make
sure that every component that touches a protected content stream adheres to the
specification .
If it finds a noncompliant device , it can downgrade the content
stream to deliver a lower - quality picture -- or it can even refuse to play the
content at all , depending on the rights holder 's preferences .
So you see the next step .
First , they prevented fair use of copies .
Now , they are going to prevent fair use of the original .
Back to the book analogy , its as if the book will not open and let itself be read unless you can prove to the publisher that you are keeping the book in a locked room so no one else will ever read it .
And it is Microsoft who has enabled this , by providing the the tools to do so in their operating system .
Remember the fallout from Sony putting spyware , err copy protection , in their CD's -- turns out that that event was just a dress rehearsal for Windows Vista .
As Rosoff 's statement implies , many of Vista 's DRM technologies exist not
because Microsoft wanted them there ; rather , they were developed at the behest
of movie studios , record labels and other high - powered intellectual property
owners .
" Microsoft was dealing here with a group of companies that simply do n't trust
the hardware [ industry ] , " Rosoff said .
" They wanted more control and more
security than they had in the past " -- and if Microsoft failed to accommodate
them , " they were prepared to walk away from Vista " by withholding support for
next - generation DVD formats and other high - value content .
Microsoft 's official position is that Vista 's DRM capabilities serve users by
providing access to high - quality content that rights holders would otherwise
serve only at degraded quality levels , if they chose to serve them at all .
" In
order to achieve that content flow , appropriate content - protection measures must
be in place that create incentives for content owners while providing consumers
the experiences they want and have grown to expect , "
Nope , no arrogance here .
Matt Rosoff , lead analyst at research firm Directions On Microsoft , asserts that
this process does not bode well for new content formats such as Blu-ray and
HD - DVD , neither of which are likely to survive their association with DRM
technology .
" I could not be more skeptical about the viability of the DRM
included with Vista , from either a technical or a business standpoint , " Rosoff
stated .
" It 's so consumer - unfriendly that I think it 's bound to fail -- and when
it fails , it will sink whatever new formats content owners are trying to
impose . "

Update : OpenOffice 2.1 is out .
We love OpenOffice at our company .
We stopped buying MS Office a couple of years ago and have been thrilled with the decision .
The version 1 release was weak but since version 2.0 it has been a very strong offering .
It is nice to see Sun getting its Microsoft hatred out in a more productive manner than suing them all over the place .
The peaks are snowy but the valleys remain bare
Some resorts have delayed their openings , while early season World Cup ski races have been cancelled .
While the peaks of many mountains have finally been dusted in white , lower runs are still green because it has been too warm to make artificial snow .
Tourist workers , however , say they are still optimistic of a white Christmas .
The lack of snow has been particularly felt in Austria , where newspapers have run headlines such as " Spring in December , " and " Winter cancelled " .
The resort of St Anton has delayed the scheduled opening of its season from 26 November to 8 December .
' Season lasts longer '
Eleanore Gudmundsson , from the Austrian National Tourist Office , says it is too early for skiers to get depressed .
" Of course we are waiting for the snow to come .
Sometimes we have enough snow in the beginning of December , other years we do not have enough snow , " she said .
The highest resorts , like Val Thorens , are well covered
" Basically , we can say that winter tends to start a little bit later but the tourist season lasts a little bit longer .
This year , I remember skiing until the beginning of April and we had perfect snow conditions . "
Resort officials , hotel owners and seasonal workers are pinning their hopes on storms forecast for this week .
Matt Taylor of the BBC Weather Centre said south - westerly and westerly winds had kept the temperature mild during autumn across Western Europe , but more northerly winds arriving soon could cause a drop in temperature .
" There will be a big low pressure area forming on Wednesday night in the Alps and a chance for snowfall on higher areas as those north - westerly winds arrive , " he said .
All of Europe 's skiing fields seem to be affected - St Moritz in Switzerland and Val D'Isere in France have cancelled skiing events , while Soldeu in Andorra , in the Pyrenees , has also delayed the start of its season .
Fears about the long - term prospects of the ski industry remain .
A recent UN report on climate change warned that snowfall in low - altitude resorts in the Alps is likely to become increasingly unreliable in the coming decades .
Not worried
But local people say they have seen such conditions before .
Nick Newell , who runs a ski chalet for Nick Ski in the French resort of La Tania , says he is not worried .
" It 's probably pretty similar to normal for this time of year - it 's just not been very cold to put the [ artificial snow ] cannons on .
But it only takes about three days to make a run up with cannons . "
And any worries had had no effect on bookings , he said .
" We 're up over 10 % on last year , and choc - a - block for much of the season , " he said .
Google boss Eric Schmidt said the search engine could one day answer hypothetical questions
The web giant currently anonymises a user 's search history after 18 months .
There are concerns among some privacy advocates that Google could know too much about a user 's web history .
But Marissa Mayer , vice - president of search , said the firm would look at letting users opt in to having their search data held for longer .
Google currently offers an opt - in personalised search facility , which learns how and what users search for in order to improve the accuracy of results .
Personalised search
Speaking at a press event in Paris , Ms Mayer said : " Personalised search tracks and shows you in your search history the clicks and trends of your searches .
" Based on what we see as your searching pattern it ultimately can enhance your result .
" There 's a simple way to turn it on and off .
We will only use the data that a user gives us to target personalised search . "
Google anonymises that information after 18 months and so the search engine has to re-learn the patterns of user behaviour .
Our goal is to have a Google search as fast as a light beam to and from our data centres from your location
Marissa Mayer , Google
She said : " We have declared that we keep our records of searches for 18 months .
We think that this was a good compromise and also something which benefited our users .
" Eighteen months is sufficient to do a good job of personalising so we think that personalised search will continue and will be successful .
" At the same time it protects our users ' privacy as we anonymise the logs after 18 months . "
But she said Google would consider offering an enhanced form of the service .
" For users who opt in for us to have data longer , as long as they explicitly consent , there is the possibility we can do that , " she said .
Predict intent
The more a search engine can learn about a user 's surfing habits , the better it can predict their intent .
With more web history data , Google could offer users a " hyper- personal " experience , with results based on potentially years ' worth of pattern analysis of a user 's search history .
Speaking about the long - term aspirations for Google , Eric Schmidt , the firm 's chief executive , said one day the search engine could potentially answer questions such as " What shall I do tomorrow ? " and " Which college should I go to ? " .
" Google is not at all done with your information problems .
There are many , many examples of where it would be nice if Google had more of an ability to understand time and choices .
" It will be some years before we can at least partially answer those questions .
But the eventual outcome is ... that Google can answer a more hypothetical question . "
He added : " The important principle , and I want to say this over and over again , is that this is opt - in , user choice . "
Biggest hurdles
One of the biggest hurdles facing any search engine is trying to understand what a user is specifically searching for when using terms which could be interpreted in different ways and the context of the search itself .
Google says it searches tens of billions of pages , three times more than its nearest rival .
The number of pages it searches has grown by more than a factor of a 1,000 in the last eight years , said Ms Mayer .
She said : " In the early days of the internet you could actually offer search results as a list , and organise them by hand .
" But as you include more and more information , relevance and ranking gets harder . "
Ms Mayer said that speed of search results was becoming an increasingly important factor .
" We have continually tried to improve our speed and that speed has yielded more and more searches .
" Our goal is to have a Google search as fast as a light beam to and from our data centres from your location . "

Getting people to click on another search site is tricky
Given that search is the number one web activity and intrinsic to the fabric of online life it is perhaps strange that most people are content to limit their information - seeking to just one search engine .
With few studies to prove that Google 's results are significantly better than its rivals , search engines such as Ask are keen to persuade users to experiment with the alternatives .
But it is going to be hard to break the Google habit .
" There is nothing to stop people using other search engines , " said Nate Elliot , analyst with research firm Jupiter .
" It is n't much trouble to go to another but people increasingly have Google on their browser window and even for those that type it in each time it has become a habitual thing , "
It was n't always so .
Mr Elliot remembers a time when searchers were a " far more fickle bunch " , with search engines such as AltaVista and HotBot flavours of the month .
Google noise
Google 's popularity was partly kick started by its clean , uncluttered homepage which won many admirers .
Now efforts to tie users to it with downloadable search toolbars and services such as Gmail and Google Earth are paying dividends , while partnerships with ISPs , portals and social networks are cementing its brand in consumers ' minds .
AltaVista was one of the first popular search engines
" Google is seen as being innovative and they do a great job of portraying themselves as innovators .
That could be a matter for debate but in the consumer 's mind it is n't , " he said .
With the search marketing spend in the UK netting a healthy £ 607 m in 2006 , being an also - ran in the race to beat Google can be profitable and , increasingly , rivals are realising that overtaking Google in the near future will be a mammoth task .
" It 's not about overhauling Google but more about narrowing the gap .
There is no point trying to be a flat - out copy .
It is more a question of offering a different experience with tools that provide users with a better experience , " said Mr Elliot .
Ask , which last year ditched its iconic butler Jeeves , has been working hard to differentiate itself with tools that allow users to get a miniaturised version of a site before they visit it as well as offering ways to refine search around related topics .
Ask has adopted guerrilla tactics to tackle the 800lb Google gorilla in its latest marketing campaign .
In a series of TV ads it is represented as a revolutionary underground alternative .
" The Google brand is so ubiquitous that people stop listening to the messages of alternative engines .
It is hard to fight through the noise that surrounds Google , especially in the media , " said Jim Lanzone , chief executive of Ask .
" When it comes to information people should n't limit themselves to one option .
" It is n't really anti-Google .
Google just happens to be the brand that people are unreasonably attached to and the issue is that people are not experimenting with other products .
It is not about overthrowing the regime but more why you should also elect us , " he said .
Meta-search
But while there are studies that show people think search in general is not as good as they would like , there is little evidence that they are looking to switch their loyalties from Google .
Ask is offering tools to tune search results
One alternative is the idea of meta - search - search engines that compile results from a variety of other search engines .
One such is WebFetch , the brainchild of InfoSpace , a company that has been powering the search engines of companies such as The Guardian , EMAP , the London Stock Exchange and Pipex for years .
WebFetch is InfoSpace 's first foray into the consumer market and it compiles results from all the leading search engines , including Google , Ask , MSN and Yahoo .
It has limited ambitions - hoping to grab just 1 % of the search market in the UK .
" We are not naive enough to think that we are going to take over but perhaps people are looking for something different , " said Dominic Trigg , vice president of search and directories at InfoSpace .
Unlike Ask , WebFetch will not be relying on advertising campaigns .
Instead Mr Trigg and his team have been given a year to build up the reputation of WebFetch , largely by word - of - mouth .
Its sister search engine in the US - DogPile - has won some admirers .
It beat Ask , Google , Yahoo and MSN in a poll conducted by JD Power .
The survey rated search engines on a set of criteria , including functionality , ease of use and results .
People - powered
The movement to persuade users away from the dominant search engines such as Google and Yahoo may be small but it is gathering momentum from those with more solid radical credentials .
At the end of last year , Jimmy Wales , founder of the online encyclopedia Wikipedia offered an alternative " people - powered " search engine .
His plan , still in its infancy , is to Wiki - fy the process of internet search , so that human beings decide openly how to rank and organise information , not the huge private servers of Google and Yahoo .
He labelled the project " Search Wikia " and has high ambitions for it to be " the search engine that changes everything " .
The plan follows criticism of the secrecy surrounding the algorithms of the leading search engines .
The battle to challenge Google could be underway .
Ruby Code & Style
Creating DSLs with Ruby
by Jim Freeze
March 16 , 2006
Broadly speaking , there are two ways to create a DSL .
One is to invent a syntax from scratch , and build an interpreter or compiler .
The other is to tailor an existing general - purpose language by adding or changing methods , operators , and default actions .
This article explores using the latter method to build a DSL on top of Ruby .
A DSL , or domain specific language , is a ( usually small ) programming or description language designed for a fairly narrow purpose .
In contrast to general - purpose languages designed to handle arbitrary computational tasks , DSLs are specific to particular domains .
You can create a DSL in two basic ways :
Invent a DSL syntax from scratch , and build an interpreter or compiler .
Tailor an existing general - purpose language by adding or changing methods , operators , and default actions .
An advantage to the second approach is that you save time because you do n't have to write and debug a new language , leaving you more time to focus on the problem confronting the end -user .
Among the disadvantages is that the DSL will be constrained by the syntax and the capabilities of the underlying general - purpose language .
Furthermore , building on another language often means that the full power of the base language is available to the end - user , which may be a plus or minus depending on the circumstances .
This article explores using the second approach to build a DSL on top of Ruby .
Describing Stackup Models
At my job , where I work as an interconnect modeling engineer , we needed a way to describe the vertical geometric profile of the circuitry on a semiconductor wafer .
Descriptions were kept in a stackup model file ( We coined the word stackup because of the logical way the metal wires are constructed by stacking layers on top of each other in the fabrication process ) .
The issue was that each vendor had their own format for describing a stackup ; but we wanted a common format so we could convert between the various file types .
In other words , we needed to define a common stackup DSL and write a program that could export from our stackup format to any of the other vendors ’ stackup format .
The vendors did not use a sophisticated DSL language , but instead their languages contained only static data elements in a mostly flat textual database .
Their file formats did not allow for parameterized types , variables , constants , or equations .
Just static data .
Further , the format was overly simple .
It was either line based or block based with one level of hierarchy .
We started out describing our stack - up format with limited ambition since we only needed to meet the vendors ’ level of implementation .
But once we saw the benefit of having a more expressive language , we quickly augmented our format .
Why were we able to do this , but not the vendors ?
I believe it was because we used Ruby as a DSL , rather than start from scratch using C as the vendors did .
Granted , other languages could have been used , but I do n’t think the finished product would have been as elegant ; the selection of the general - purpose language is a critical step .
I also believe the vendors ’ development speed was handicapped from using C , prompting them to keep their stackup syntax simple to parse .
Perhaps , not coincidentally , many of the vendors used simple syntax constructs in their file formats common to many DSLs .
Because they occur so often , we are going to first look at how we can mimic these in Ruby before we move into more sophisticated language constructs .
Line - based and Block - level DSL Constructs
Line - based constructs are a way to assign a value or a range of values to a parameter .
Among the vendors ’ files we were looking at , the following formats were used :
parameter = value parameter value parameter min_value max_value step_value
Formats 1 and 2 are equivalent except for the implied ’= ’ in 2 .
Format 3 assigned a range of values to the parameter .
The more complicated formats contained a block construct .
The two that we encountered could be manually parsed with a line - based parser and a stack , or a key - letter and word parser with a stack .
These two formats are illustrated below :
begin type = TYPE name = NAME param1 = value1 param2 = value2 ... end
One of the block formats used “ C ” style curly braces to identify a block , but parameter / value pairs were separated by white space .
TYPE NAME { param1 = value1 param2 = value2 }
Third Time ’s a Charm
When we were building our DSL for the stackup file we solved the problem three times .
First , we wrote our own parser and decided it was too much work to maintain .
Not only the code , but also the documentation .
Since our DSL was sufficiently complicated , it was n’t obvious how to use all its features and therefore it had to be copiously documented .
Next , for a short period , we implemented the DSL in XML .
This removed the need for us to write our own parser , as XML is universally understood , but it contained too much noise and obscured the contents of the file .
Our engineers found it too difficult to mentally task - switch between thinking about the meaning of the stackup and mentally parsing XML .
For me , the lesson learned was that XML is not to be read by humans and probably a bad choice for a DSL , regardless of the parsing benefits .
Finally , we implemented the DSL in Ruby .
The implementation was quick since Ruby provides the parsing .
Documentation on the parser ( i.e. Ruby ) was not required since it is already available .
And the final DSL was easily understood by humans , yet compact and versatile .
So , let ’s build a DSL in Ruby that lets us define ‘ parameter = value ’ statements .
Consider the following hypothetical DSL file .
% cat params_with_equal.dsl name = fred parameter = .55
This is not valid Ruby code , so we need to modify the syntax slightly so Ruby accepts it .
Let ’s change it to :
% cat params_with_equal.dsl name = " fred " parameter = 0.55
Once we get the DSL to follow valid Ruby syntax , Ruby does all the work to parse the file and hold the data in a way that we can operate on it .
Now let ’s write some Ruby code to read this DSL .
First we want to encapsulate these parameters somehow .
A good way is to put them into a class .
We ’ll call this class MyDSL .
% cat mydsl.rb class MyDSL ... end #class MyDSL
From the developer ’s perspective , we want a simple and straightforward way to parse the DSL file .
Something like :
my_dsl = MyDSL.load( filename )
So , let ’s write the class method load :
def self.load ( filename ) dsl = new dsl.instance_eval ( File.read( filename ) , filename ) dsl end
The class method load creates a MyDSL object and calls instance_eval on the DSL file ( params_with_equal.dsl above ) .
The second argument to instance_eval is optional and allows Ruby to report a filename on parse errors .
An optional third argument ( not shown ) gives you the ability to provide a starting line number for parse error reporting .
% cat dsl-loader.rb require ' mydsl ' my_dsl = MyDSL.load( ARGV.shift ) # put the DSL filename on the command line p my_dsl p my_dsl.instance_variables % ruby dsl- loader.rb params_with_equal.dsl #< MyDSL:0x89cd8 > [ ]
name
parameter
name
parameter
self .name = " fred "
self .
parameter = 0.55
'@ '
@name = " fred " @parameter = 0.55
Is this code going to work ?
Let ’s see what happens :
What happened ?
Where didandgo ?
Well , sinceandare on the left hand side of the equals sign , Ruby thinks they are local variables .
We can tell Ruby otherwise by writingandin the DSL file or we can impose upon the user to do this using thesymbol :
But that is kind of ugly and , to me , about the same as if we had written
$ name = " fred " $ parameter = 0.55
Another way to let Ruby know the context of these methods is to declare the scope explicitly by yielding self ( the MyDSL object instance ) to a block .
To do this , we will need to add a top level method to jump start our DSL and put the contents inside of the attached block .
Our modified DSL now looks like :
% cat params_with_equal2.dsl define_parameters do |p| p.name = " fred " p.parameter = 0.55 end
where we have defined define_parameters as an instance method :
% cat mydsl2.rb class MyDSL def define_parameters yield self end def self.load ( filename ) dsl = new dsl.instance_eval ( File.read( filename ) , filename ) dsl end end #class MyDSL
And we change the require in dsl - loader to use the new version of the MyDSL class in mydsl2.rb :
% cat dsl-loader.rb require ' mydsl2 ' my_dsl = MyDSL.load( ARGV.shift ) p my_dsl p my_dsl.instance_variables
Theoretically , this should work , but let ’s test it out just to make sure .
% ruby dsl- loader.rb params_with_equal2.dsl params_with_equal2.dsl:2:in `load ' : undefined method `name= ' for #< MyDSL:0x26300 > ( NoMethodError )
Oops .
We forgot the accessors for name and parameter .
Let ’s add those and look at the complete program :
% cat mydsl2.rb class MyDSL attr_accessor : name , : parameter def define_parameters yield self end def self.load ( filename ) # ... same as before end end
% ruby dsl- loader.rb params_with_equal2.dsl #< MyDSL:0x25ec8 @name= " fred " , @parameter=0.55 > [ " @name " , " @parameter " ]
Now , let 's test it again .
Success !
This now works , but we have added two extra lines to the DSL file and have added some noise with the ‘ p. ’ notation .
This notation is better suited when there exists multiple levels of hierarchy in the file and there is actually a need for and a benefit from explicitly specifying context .
In our simple case we can implicitly define context and leave no doubt for Ruby that name and parameter are methods .
We do this by removing the ’= ’ sign and write the DSL file as
% cat params.dsl name " fred " parameter 0.55
Now we need to define a new type of accessor for name and parameter .
The trick here is to realize that name without an argument is a reader for @name , and name with one or more arguments is a setter for @name .
( Note : it is convenient to use this methodology even when multiple levels of hierarchy are present and context is explicitly declared . )
We define the accessors for name and parameter by removing the attr_accessor line and adding the following code :
% cat mydsl3.rb class MyDSL def name ( * val ) if val.empty ?
@name else @name = val.size == 1 ? val [ 0 ] : val end end def parameter ( * val ) if val.empty ?
@parameter else @parameters = val.size == 1 ? val [ 0 ] : val end end def self.load ( filename ) # ... same as before end end #class MyDSL
If either name or parameter is seen without arguments , they will return their value .
If arguments are present , they will be assigned the value when a single argument is present , or they will be assigned to an array of values for multiple arguments .
Let ’s run our sample parser ( changed to require the file mydsl3.rb ) to test our handiwork :
% ruby dsl- loader.rb params.dsl #< MyDSL:0x25edc @parameter=0.55 , @name= " fred " > [ " @parameter " , " @name " ]
Success again !
But defining these accessors explicitly is a pain .
So let ’s define a custom DSL accessor and make it available to all classes .
We do this by putting the method in the Module class .
% cat dslhelper.rb class Module def dsl_accessor( * symbols ) symbols .each { | sym| class_eval %{ def # {sym} ( * val ) if val.empty ?
@# {sym} else @#{sym} = val.size == 1 ? val [ 0 ] : val end end } } end end
The above code simply defines the dsl_accessor method which creates our DSL specific accessors .
We now plug it into the application and use dsl_accessor instead of attr_accessor to get :
% cat mydsl4.rb require ' dslhelper ' class MyDSL dsl_accessor : name , : parameter def self.load ( filename ) # ... same as before end end #class MyDSL
require
dsl-loader.rb
mydsl4.rb
% ruby dsl- loader.rb params.dsl #< MyDSL:0x25edc @parameter=0.55 , @name= " fred " > [ " @parameter " , " @name " ]
Again , we update thestatement into load thefile and run the loader :
This is all well and good , but what if we do n’t know the parameter names in advance ?
Depending on the use cases for the DSL , parameter names may be generated by the user .
Never fear .
With Ruby , we have the power of method_missing .
A two - line method added to MyDSL will define a DSL attribute with dsl_accessor on demand .
That is , if a value is to be assigned to a ( thus far ) non-existent parameter , method_missing will define the getters and setters and assign the value to the parameter .
% cat mydsl5.rb require ' dslhelper ' class MyDSL def method_missing ( sym , * args ) self.class.dsl_accessor sym send ( sym , * args ) end def self.load ( filename ) # ...
Same as before end end % head - 1 dsl-loader.rb require ' mydsl5 ' % ruby dsl- loader.rb params.dsl #< MyDSL:0x25b80 @parameter=0.55 , @name= " fred " > [ " @parameter " , " @name " ]
Wow !
Does n't that make you feel good ?
With just a little bit of code , we have a parser that can read and define an arbitrary number of parameters .
Well , almost .
What if the end - user does n't know Ruby and uses parameter names that collide with existing method calls ?
For example , what if our DSL file contains the following :
% cat params_with_keyword.dsl methods %w ( one two three ) id 12345 % ruby dsl- loader.rb params_with_keyword.dsl params_with_keyword.dsl:2:in `id ' : wrong number of arguments ( 1 for 0 ) ( ArgumentError )
BlankSlate
MyDSL
% cat mydsl6.rb require ' dslhelper ' class BlankSlate instance_methods .each { | m| undef_method (m ) unless %w ( __send__ __id__ send class inspect instance_eval instance_variables ) .include ?( m ) } end#class BlankSlate # MyDSL now inherits from BlankSlate class MyDSL < BlankSlate # ... nothing new here , move along ... end #class MyDSL
% head - 1 dsl-loader.rb require ' mydsl6 ' % ruby dsl- loader.rb params_with_keyword.dsl #< MyDSL:0x23538 @id=12345 , @methods =[ " one " , " two " , " three " ] > [ " @id " , " @methods " ]
Oh , how embarrassing .
Well , we can fix this ( mostly ) in short order with a little help from a class called 0 ] , which was initially conceived by Jim Weirich [ 1 ] .
The BlankSlate class used here is a little different than the one introduced by Jim simply because we want to keep a little more functionality around .
So we keep seven methods .
You can experiment with these to see which ones are absolutely required and which ones we are using just to visualize the contents of ourobject .
Now when we try to load the DSL file that is loaded with keywords , we should get something a little more sensible :
And sure enough , we do .
This is good news that we can remove spurious methods and free up more possibilities of parameter names for our end -users .
However , note that we can't give end - users a completely unrestrained license to use any name for a parameter .
This is one of the downsides of using a generic - programming language as a DSL , but I think that an end - user being prohibited from using class as a parameter name has only a small risk of being a deal killer .
Getting More Sophisticated
We are now ready to look at more complex DSL features .
Instead of a DSL for manipulating data , let ’s look at one that performs a more concrete action .
Imagine that we are tired of manually creating a common set of directories and files whenever we start a new project .
It would be nice if we had Ruby do this for us .
It would even be nicer if we had a small DSL such that we could modify the project directory structure without editing the low - level code .
We begin this project by defining a DSL that makes sense for this problem .
The file below is our version 0.0.1 of just such a DSL .
% cat project_template.dsl create_project do dir " bin " do create_from_template : exe , name end dir " lib " do create_rb_file name dir name do create_rb_file name end end dir " test " touch :CHANGELOG , :README , :TODO end
In this file , we create a project and add three directories and three files .
Inside the “ bin ” directory we create an executable file with the same name as the project using the : exe template .
In the ‘ lib ’ directory , we create a .rb file , and a directory , both named after the project .
Inside that inner directory , another .rb file with the same name as the project .
Next , back at the top level , the ‘ test ’ directory is created , and , finally , three empty files are created .
The methods needed for this DSL are : create_project , dir , create_from_template , create_rb_file and touch .
Let ’s look at these methods one by one .
The create_project method is our top level wrapper .
This method provides scope by letting us put all the DSL code inside a block .
( Complete listings are at the end of the article . )
def create_project ( ) yield end
The dir method is the workhorse .
This method not only creates the directory , it also maintains the current working directory in the @cwd instance variable .
Here , the use of ensure allows us to trivially maintain the proper state of @cwd .
def dir( dir_name ) old_cwd = @cwd @cwd = File.join ( @cwd , dir_name ) FileUtils.mkdir_p( @cwd ) yield self if block_given ?
ensure @cwd = old_cwd end
The touch and create_rb_file methods are the same except that the latter adds ” .rb ” to the filename .
These methods may be given one or more filenames where the names can be either strings or symbols .
def touch ( * file_names ) file_names.flatten.each { | file| FileUtils.touch( File.join( @cwd , " #{file} " ) ) } end
Finally , the create_from_template method is just a quick dash to illustrate how one may put some actual functionality into a DSL .
( See the source listings for the complete code . )
To run and test the code , we build a small test application :
% cat create_project.rb require ' project_builder ' project_name = ARGV.shift proj = ProjectBuilder.load( project_name ) puts " == DIR TREE OF PROJECT '# {project_name} ' == " puts `find #{project_name}`
And the results are :
% ruby create_project.rb fred == DIR TREE OF PROJECT ' fred ' == fred fred / bin fred / bin / fred fred / CHANGELOG fred / lib fred / lib / fred fred /lib/fred/fred.rb fred/lib/fred.rb fred /README fred / test fred / TODO
% cat fred / bin / fred #!/usr/bin/env ruby require ' rubygems ' require ' commandline require ' fred ' class FredApp < CommandLine :: Application def initialize end def main end end #class FredApp
Wow !
It worked !
And with not much effort .
Summary
I work on many projects that require a rather detailed control flow description .
For every project , this used to make me pause and consider how to get all this detailed configuration data into the application .
Now , Ruby as a DSL is near the top of the list of possibilities , and usually solves the problem quickly and efficiently .
When I was doing Ruby training , I would take the class through a problem solving technique where we would describe the problem in plain English , then in pseudo code , and then in Ruby .
But , in some cases , the pseudo code would be valid Ruby code .
I think that the high readability quotient of Ruby makes it an ideal language for use as a DSL .
And as Ruby becomes known by more people , DSLs written in Ruby will be a favorable way of communicating with an application .

Do n’t Throw Out Maybe Yet !
Jeffrey Zeldman ’s post “ Maybe ” is one option too many caught my eye this afternoon .
I completely agree with him that “ maybe ” is a pain in the neck .
From my vantage point , yes / no ( or like / dislike ) are the only user inputs that really matter .
But …
Most of you will notice that BeerRiot has a third option – “ shrug ” .
It was n’t always this way .
The first versions of BeerRiot had no middle ground – you liked a beer , or you disliked it .
I was staunch in my position , callously telling people that they should make up their mind .
It was n’t until over half of the first twenty people to which I showed BeerRiot asked , “ Where ’s ‘ meh ’ ? ” that I started to change my thinking .
I started to realize that being forced to make a black / white decision was making people uneasy .
They really wanted the comfort of being able to postpone making their choice .
The decision was pretty easy at that point .
I wanted people to stay around my site .
Therefore , it seemed a good idea to make them comfortable .
Shrug was born .
In the time since introducing shrug , I ’ve found it to be more than just indecision .
It ’s a way to acknowledge the existence of a thing , without passing judgement .
For beer voting , it lets me know that although I have no strong feelings about a beer , I have tried it ( something I have trouble remembering with the wide variety available ) .
I can see it working similarly for party invites : it lets the organizer know that even though I do n’t know my schedule , I have , in fact , received the invitation .
Here ’s another way to think about it .
Suppose there is no “ maybe ” option .
You must either accept or decline the invitation .
So , what are people who do n’t respond ?
Are they not “ maybe ” ?
Maybe you ’re a pessimistic person : you consider non-responders “ no ” .
Okay , then , if all non-responders are “ no ” , then why even have a “ no ” option ?
Why not just have “ yes ” ?
A unary system – respond “ yes ” , or you do n’t exist .
For BeerRiot , at least , that would seriously cut my dataset .
I think the same would be true for party invites .
You could n’t even tell what kind of buffer you might want to plan for – all you would know is the number of people who are definitely coming .
Or in BeerRiot ’s case , I could n’t tell if a beer is controversial – I ’d only know the number of people who like it .
So , I say do n’t throw maybe out yet .
It ’s more than just indecision .
It ’s user comfort and metadata all rolled into one .
I ’ll leave you with this , though : I do n’t see the point in more than three choices .
“ Kind - of - like ” and “ Sort - of - dislike ” are even less data than maybe to me .
At least with “ maybe ” I can tell the voter is unsure .
With “ maybe - like ” , I ca n’t tell if she ’s unsure or genuinely less positive about this beer than others .
P.S. I love Bill W. ’s comment about rating other people ’s ratings .
It ’s exactly the kind of problem that BeerRiot tries to solve .

IN THOSE parts of the planet that might once have been described as “ Christendom ” , this week marks the season of peace on Earth and goodwill towards men .
A nice idea in a world more usually thought of as seasoned by the survival of the fittest .
But goodwill and collaboration are as much part of the human condition as ill - will and competition .
And that was a puzzle to 19th - century disciples of Charles Darwin , such as Herbert Spencer .
It was Spencer , an early contributor to The Economist , who invented that poisoned phrase , “ survival of the fittest ” .
He originally applied it to the winnowing of firms in the harsh winds of high - Victorian capitalism , but when Darwin 's masterwork , “ On the Origin of Species ” , was published , he quickly saw the parallel with natural selection and transferred his bon mot to the process of evolution .
As a result , he became one of the band of philosophers known as social Darwinists .
Capitalists all , they took what they thought were the lessons of Darwin 's book and applied them to human society .
Their hard - hearted conclusion , of which a 17th - century religious puritan might have been proud , was that people got what they deserved — albeit that the criterion of desert was genetic , rather than moral .
The fittest not only survived , but prospered .
Moreover , the social Darwinists thought that measures to help the poor were wasted , since such people were obviously unfit and thus doomed to sink .
Sadly , the slur stuck .
For 100 years Darwinism was associated with a particularly harsh and unpleasant view of the world and , worse , one that was clearly not true — at least , not the whole truth .
People certainly compete , but they collaborate , too .
They also have compassion for the fallen and frequently try to help them , rather than treading on them .
For this sort of behaviour , “ On the Origin of Species ” had no explanation .
As a result , Darwinism had to tiptoe round the issue of how human society and behaviour evolved .
Instead , the disciples of a second 19th - century creed , Marxism , dominated academic sociology departments with their cuddly collectivist ideas — even if the practical application of those ideas has been even more catastrophic than social Darwinism was .
Trust me , I 'm a Darwinist
But the real world eventually penetrates even the ivory tower .
The failure of Marxism has prompted an opening of minds , and Darwinism is back with a vengeance — and a twist .
Exactly how humanity became human is still a matter of debate .
But there are , at least , some well - formed hypotheses ( see article ) .
What these hypotheses have in common is that they rely not on Spencer 's idea of individual competition , but on social interaction .
That interaction is , indeed , sometimes confrontational and occasionally bloody .
But it is frequently collaborative , and even when it is not , it is more often manipulative than violent .
Modern Darwinism 's big breakthrough was the identification of the central role of trust in human evolution .
People who are related collaborate on the basis of nepotism .
It takes outrageous profit or provocation for someone to do down a relative with whom they share a lot of genes .
Trust , though , allows the unrelated to collaborate , by keeping score of who does what when , and punishing cheats .
Very few animals can manage this .
Indeed , outside the primates , only vampire bats have been shown to trust non-relatives routinely .
( Well - fed bats will give some of the blood they have swallowed to hungry neighbours , but expect the favour to be returned when they are hungry and will deny favours to those who have cheated in the past . )
The human mind , however , seems to have evolved the trick of being able to identify a large number of individuals and to keep score of its relations with them , detecting the dishonest or greedy and taking vengeance , even at some cost to itself .
This process may even be — as Matt Ridley , who wrote for this newspaper a century and a half after Spencer , described it — the origin of virtue .
The new social Darwinists ( those who see society itself , rather than the savannah or the jungle , as the “ natural ” environment in which humanity is evolving and to which natural selection responds ) have not abandoned Spencer altogether , of course .
But they have put a new spin on him .
The ranking by wealth of which Spencer so approved is but one example of a wider tendency for people to try to out - do each other .
And that competition , whether athletic , artistic or financial , does seem to be about genetic display .
Unfakeable demonstrations of a superiority that has at least some underlying genetic component are almost unfailingly attractive to the opposite sex .
Thus both of the things needed to make an economy work , collaboration and competition , seem to have evolved under Charles Darwin 's penetrating gaze .
Dystopia and Utopia
This is a view full of ironies , of course .
One is that its reconciliation of competition and collaboration bears a remarkable similarity to the sort of Hegelian synthesis beloved of Marxists .
Perhaps a bigger one , though , is that the Earth 's most capitalist country , America , is the only place in the rich world that contains a significant group of dissenters from any sort of evolutionary explanation of human behaviour at all .
But it is also , in its way , a comforting view .
It suggests a constant struggle , not for existence itself , but between selfishness and altruism — a struggle that neither can win .
Utopia may be impossible , but Dystopia is unstable , too , as the collapse of Marxism showed .
Human nature is not , to use another of Spencer 's favourite phrases ( though one he borrowed from Tennyson , his poetical contemporary ) , red in tooth and claw , and societies built around the idea that it is are doomed to early failure .
Of the three great secular faiths born in the 19th century — Darwinism , Marxism and Freudianism — the second died swiftly and painfully and the third is slipping peacefully away .
But Darwinism goes from strength to strength .
If its ideas are right , the handful of dust that evolution has shaped into humanity will rarely stray too far off course .
And that is , perhaps , a hopeful thought to carry into the New Year .
2007 –2016 : documenting our journey
Towards the end of 2006 , Daniele and I were studying in Milan and were looking for interesting things to do with our abundant spare time .
One of the ideas was a website where users could collaborate on fiction in a non-traditional way .
Stories could be the product of the work of multiple authors , who could decide to work together on a common plot line or branch off to explore different ideas .
A few months later , at the very beginning of 2007 , we opened up novlet.com to external users , hoping that our attempt at explaining what we had in mind would resonate with someone .
Before long , users were starting to contribute stories faster than we could read them , some even volunteered to translate our application to their languages .
We were very happy to notice that the atmosphere was extremely collaborative , and authors were welcoming of contributions from others , even when these diverged from the story line they had originally imagined for their story .
Of course , all of Novlet ’s value came from its community , from people who decided to dedicate their time and creativity to write stories for others and themselves .
We are deeply honored that someone decided to put that effort into something we built and it informed everything we did ever since , pushing us to work on user - facing products .
Since launching Novlet , and despite the great satisfaction we got from seeing users contribute high quality content on the website , we moved on to new adventures .
We launched bitlet.org , which got a lot of attention since the very beginning , and later got very satisfying and rewarding jobs that unfortunately did n’t leave enough time to side projects .
On the other hand , a project like Novlet would need more attention : its visuals show the decade that passed since we originally built it , our nature of engineers guarantees that a “ small tweak ” would almost certainly lead to a multiple - months stream of work and spammers make sure that we ca n’t just leave Novlet be without supervision .
It is with a heavy heart that we decided to shut the site down and write this page as a testament to our passion for the project and gratitude to our users .
We decided to collect a few of the most interesting examples on Medium :
You can find a few more examples in Echoes from Novlet .
Thank you all ,

Thousands of council officers will be enforcing the ban
Ministers have given councils £ 29.5 m to pay for staff , who will be able to give on - the - spot £ 50 fines to individuals and take court action against premises .
They will have the power to enter premises undercover , allowing them to sit among drinkers , and will even be able to photograph and film people .
Smokers ' groups and industry officials said the plans were a " waste of money " .
The smoking ban is due to come into force on 1 July .
It covers virtually all enclosed public places including offices , factories , pubs and bars .
But neither outdoor space nor private homes will be affected .
The idea of getting public officials to snoop on people is distasteful and disproportionate
Simon Clark ,
Forest
Business owners also have a duty to ensure their customers comply - they are liable for £ 200 fines if proper signs are not displayed and , potentially , fines of £ 2,500 if they refuse to enforce the ban .
Local authorities have been given the power to enforce the ban so it does not consume police time .
A government - funded course is expected to train 1,200 council officers in the next few months with more expected to follow later .
Councils will use these fully - trained officers to brief other staff on how to enforce the law as many towns and cities will have scores of officers patrolling public places .
The teams will be made up of new staff and existing officers who will be freed up to carry out inspections and offer advice .
In London , there will be several hundred of the so - called anti-smoking police .
In Westminster , scores of council officers will able to issue fines , but the authority points out that the time taken up policing the ban will be equivalent to only two full - time posts .
Two approaches
Ian Gray , policy officer for the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health and chief trainer for the government course , said he expected most councils would take a " softly , softly approach " at first .
" But there will be some occasions where action has to be taken and I am sure the compliance officers will not shy away from that , " he added .
" These officers do not have to identify themselves when they go into premises and they can even film and photograph people to gather evidence although this may not be appropriate in many cases .
" There will be two ways of doing this , either staff can go in and identify themselves to the landlord , but they do n't have to . "
We want to make our presence felt from the start
Andy Hull ,
Liverpool City Council
In Nottingham , there will be about 30 officers patrolling the city , composed of new staff and existing environmental health officers .
But the council is also exploring the possibility of getting street wardens , who currently aid the local police force , to help ensure the ban is effectively enforced .
Steve Dowling , director of environment and public protection at Nottingham City Council , said : " We have about 100 wardens and they could keep an eye on whether people are smoking in pubs as they go about their other duties .
" But it is not just about pubs and restaurants .
" We will also be looking at the likes of car garages and shops are complying as well . "
' A sledgehammer '
In Liverpool , there will be a core team of about 20 to 25 staff keeping an eye on public places , although in the first few days after the start of the ban the council is planning to do a mass patrol of the city with 200 staff .
HAVE YOUR SAY
If only this money could be spent on having real police on our streets catching and deterring real criminals
Dan Hassett , Folkestone
Send us your comments
Liverpool City Council official Andy Hull said : " We want to make our presence felt from the start , and while we will probably just issue warnings on the first day , we wo n't be afraid of making an example of people or businesses if they try to make a stand . "
And across Wales , where the smoking ban comes into force in April , 500 officers will be carrying out inspections after councils received just under £ 3 m .
But Simon Clark , director of smokers ' lobby group Forest , said : " The idea of getting public officials to snoop on people is distasteful and disproportionate .
" It is like taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut .
Smokers will abide by the law so it will be a complete waste of public money . "
And a spokesman for the British Beer and Pub Association added the approach was too " heavy - handed and elaborate " , especially when the experience in Scotland , which has already introduced a ban , is considered .
" In Scotland , there have been just 11 fixed penalty notices issued to premises in the last 10 months , with many councils having issued none at all . "
A pre-Easter email from marketing bods at Amazon.co.uk raised the hackles of one Reg reader with its subject line : " Bonking like a Spring Bunny ?
Rampant Rabbits from £ 17.50 at Amazon.co.uk . "
The Rampant Rabbit is not , we are reliably informed , an actual Easter Bunny .
The email arrived complete with eye - watering pictures of " Spring Bunnies of a different sort " , love eggs , clitoral stimulators , butt plugs , and a range of goods called " male pleasure sleeves " .
The Reg reader , who denies ever purchasing such products , and certainly not from Amazon , was not impressed .
He told us by email : " This email was fully illustrated with all manner of ' exotic ' devices normally found in Sex Shops and not in my inbox . "
He did receive an apology from Amazon blaming a " technical error " and promised the mistake would not be repeated .
You can see the email here , but it 's probably not safe for work .
Amazon.co.uk would not tell us how many customers received the mail , or detail the nature of the " technical error " , but did send us the following statement :
Amazon.co.uk promotional mailings are based on previous purchases and should only go to customers who have previously purchased items from a particular store .
We are aware , however , that a ' Sex & Sensuality ' promotional mail was erroneously sent to a small number of customers who have never purchased anything from our ' Sex and Sensuality ' store .
We sincerely apologise to any customer who has received this promotional mail in error and for any offence it may have caused .
We trust that the customers in question will continue to use Amazon.
co.uk for their online shopping needs .
We hope so too . ®
At one point in the hearing , Charles E. Schumer , a Democratic Senator from New York , asked Mr. Sampson , “ Did you or did you not have in mind specific replacements for the dismissed U.S. Attorneys before they were asked to resign on December 7th , 2006 . ”
Mr. Sampson , who was testifying under oath , replied , “ I personally did not .
On December 7th , I did not have in mind any replacements for any of the seven who were asked to resign . ”
The Justice Department said that the e-mail did not contradict Mr. Sampson ’s sworn testimony .
" We have consistently stated that , with the exception of Griffin , individuals were not pre-selected for any of the eight U.S. Attorney positions prior to asking the U. S. Attorneys to resign , ” said Brian Roehrkasse , a Justice Department spokesman .
“ The list made public today had previously been shared with privately with Congress , and it in no way contradicts the Department prior statement .
The list drafted 10 months before the December resignations reflects Kyle Sampson ’s initial thoughts not pre-selected candidates by the Administration . ”
Mr. Sampson ’s lawyer , Bradford Berenson , also denied that the email contradicted Mr. Sampson ’s testimony .
" Kyle ’s testimony regarding the consideration of replacements was entirely accurate .
In December 2006 , when the seven U.S. Attorneys were asked to step down , no specific candidate had been selected to replace any of them , and Kyle had none in mind .
Some names had been tentatively suggested for discussion much earlier in the process , but by the time the decision to ask for the resignations was made none had been chosen to serve as a replacement . ”
The documents turned over today brought the total number of e-mails and other records produced by the Justice Department to more than 6,000 pages .
Justice Department officials said some documents were only recently discovered , including documents from officials who were not previously required to turn over their electronic files .
In some cases , the documents represented duplicate versions of documents already provided to the committees .
Some of the document had been previously withheld by the Justice Department , but were available for review by congressional investigators .
The e-mail was among more than 2,000 pages of documents released today by the Justice Department as part of a continuing stream of e-mails and other internal records produced by the agency in the last month in response to requests by the House and Senate judiciary committees .

People have had lots of objections to Digital Rights Management ( DRM ) technology – centering mainly on its clumsiness and the futility of its anti-infringement rationale – but until recently nobody had complained that the term “ Digital Rights Management ” was insufficiently Orwellian .
That changed on Tuesday , when HBO ’s Chief Technology Officer , Bob Zitter , suggested at an industry conference that DRM needs a name change .
Zitter ’s suggested name : Digital Consumer Enablement , or DCE .
The irony here is that “ rights management ” is itself an industry - sponsored euphemism for what would more straightforwardly be
called “ restrictions ” .
But somehow the public got the idea that DRM is restrictive , hence the need for a name change .
Zitter went on to discuss HBO ’s strategy .
HBO wants to sell shows in HighDef , but the problem is that many consumers are watching HD content using the analog outputs on their set - top boxes – often because their fancy new HD televisions do n’t implement HBO ’s favorite form of DRM .
So what HBO wants is to disable the analog outputs on the set - top box , so consumers have no choice but to adopt HBO ’s favored DRM .
Which makes the nature of the “ enablement ” clear .
By enabling your set - top box to be incompatible with your TV , HBO will enable you to buy an expensive new TV .
I understand why HBO might want this .
But they ought to be honest and admit what they are doing .
I can think of several names for their strategy .
“ Consumer Enablement ” is not one of them .
In the programming world , some parts of the Python community have been complaining about this new upstart , Ruby , luring developers away from the fold .
Some parts of the Perl community have been thinking , " Ha ha , Pythonistas !
See how you like a taste of your own medicine ! "
There 's C++ vs. Java vs. C#. There 's LISP vs. Haskel vs. whatever .
But for years I 've been saying " never mind the language wars , JavaScript already won . "
JavaScript quietly conquered the world by hitching a ride with web browsers .
Whatever language is your favorite , javascript is the most widely deployed language in the world .
Google Maps and Gmail drove that point home .
AJAX hype followed .
Mozilla gets credit for taking javascript seriously for probably the longest .
When Apple introduced Dashboard and Widgets , I thought they were wisely trying to lower the barrier for web developers to build applications specifically for OS X .
As if noticing that they needed to make it easy for JavaScript developers to build stuff for MacOS .
Microsoft followed suit with " Gadgets " in Vista .
( Google offers widgets too . )
Just in case you were n't paying attention to the Stevenote , javascript just [ 1 ] made the leap to cell phones .
On a related note there have been browser wars for a long time now : you know , Internet Explorer vs.
Firefox most recently , ( which was Netscape before that , always Mozilla underneath ) .
While those two have been fighting it out on the desktop , Safari just made the leap to cell phones .
If Apple can deliver on the vision they 've painted at Macworld , Safari just became a contender .
Apple also just lowered the barrier to cell phone application development because if you 're a web developer , now you 're also developing apps for phones just like Google and Yahoo .
Not much extra effort required : how does your web app look in Safari ?
Another thing to read between the lines : OS X now runs on at least three different processors : PowerPC , Intel , and whatever is inside the iPhone prototypes .
There 's an OS wars hook in here too .
Not just the cell phone OS wars : Palm vs. Symbian vs. Microsoft Smartphone OS vs. vs. Blackberry vs. embedded Linux .
For years
Windows fans have claimed that market share is why Windows suffers five orders of magnitude more viruses and malware than Mac OS .
If Apple can deliver , the iPhone is going to take the smart phone market by storm .
They 'll quickly become the leader in that market just as they have with iPods .
And that 's Mac OS running in there .
We might just get to see a real - world test : is the blight on Windows market share as Windows fans contend or is it sucky software as Mac fans contend ?
That debate has always been vacuous theory only -- how many angels can dance on the head of a pin ?
We may yet live to see an answer to the question about market share and virus proliferation .
Hat 's off to Apple .
[ 1 ] Eric 's standard Mac - bigotry disclaimer : Apple is never the first to market with some whizzbang technology ( with the exception of the original personal computer ) .
I know that Microsoft put IE on a smart phone and Javascript came along for the ride there .
Apple is never the first .
What they do is popularize technologies .
Mice and graphical user interfaces , laser printers ( and therefor the entire desktop publishing industry ) , build - in networking ( AppleTalk was included with the original Mac in 1984 ) , fashionable enclosures ( e.g. the original iMacs ) , USB , Bluetooth , Rendezvous Bonjour ( aka. Zeroconf ) , iPods .
All of those technologies were not Apple innovations per se .
But the broader market follows their lead when Apple bets on a given technology .
Apple does reshape the market landscape on a pretty regular basis .
They 've just staked a claim on the smartphone market .
Paypal users rejoice !
Ebay 's online payment platform should soon allow you to authenticate to their service via a secureID - like password generator .
The way the device works is simple .
First , users will have to enter their username and password on sites accepting paypal payments .
Then , they 'll have to look at their password generator and input underneath the other information the 6 - character numeric key they see displayed on its screen .
This number will change every 30 seconds , preventing villains that are trying to get in the victim 's account from successfully logging in , even if they are already in possession of the user 's login information .
The device will be completely platform and browser independant , so it will work anywhere you are , whether it is at the office , at home or on a $ 100 laptop in a school in the middle of the third - world .
For those of you who wish to learn more about the " Key " and are knowledgeable about computer security , you 'll be pleased to learn that the device operates on Verisign 's two - factor authentication system ( PDF ) , a relatively new and very secure OTP technology .
The PayPal security key will cost $ 5 for common users and will be free for business users .
There will be no recurring charges after that ; the extra layer of protection is completely free .
It will first be available in February 2007 to people in the US , Australia and Germany .
If we consider the extra security this thing will bring you , I do n't think anyone who uses paypal should ignore this offer .
It may actually save you quite a bit of money if you ever are gullible enough to follow the instructions in a phishing email .
I 've been thinking of running for high office on a one - issue platform : I promise , if elected , that within four years America will have cellphone service as good as Ghana's .
If re-elected , I promise that in eight years America will have cellphone service as good as Japan's , provided Japan agrees not to forge ahead on wireless technology .
My campaign bumper sticker : " Can You Hear Me Now ? "
I began thinking about this after watching the Japanese use cellphones and laptops to get on the Internet from speeding bullet trains and subways deep underground .
But the last straw was when I could n't get cellphone service while visiting I.B.M.'s headquarters in Armonk , N.Y .
But do n't worry -- Congress is on the case .
It dropped everything last week to pass a bill to protect gun makers from shooting victims ' lawsuits .
The fact that the U.S. has fallen to 16th in the world in broadband connectivity aroused no interest .
Look , I do n't even like cellphones , but this is not about gadgets .
The world is moving to an Internet - based platform for commerce , education , innovation and entertainment .
Wealth and productivity will go to those countries or companies that get more of their innovators , educators , students , workers and suppliers connected to this platform via computers , phones and P.D.A.'s .
A new generation of politicians is waking up to this issue .
For instance , Andrew Rasiej is running in New York City 's Democratic primary for public advocate on a platform calling for wireless ( Wi - Fi ) and cellphone Internet access from every home , business and school in the city .
If , God forbid , a London - like attack happens in a New York subway , do n't trying calling 911 .
Your phone wo n't work down there .
No wireless infrastructure .
This ai n't Tokyo , pal .
Hey , Paul Wolfowitz , Gimme Five !
More from Hubris by Michael Isikoff and David Corn :
In October 2001 , [ Wayne ] Downing , [ Paul ] Wolfowitz , and other proponents of a war with Iraq thought they had yet more ammunition for the case against Saddam .
A series of deadly anthrax - laced letters had been sent to the Capitol Hill offices of Senator Daschle and Senator Patrick Leahy and to several newsrooms .
Mylroie asserted that Saddam was behind the mailings .
An early forensic test of the anthrax letters ( which was later disputed ) appeared to show that the anthrax spores were highly refined and " weaponized . "
To the Iraq hawks , the news was electric .
" This is definitely Saddam ! " Downing shouted to several White House aides .
One of these aides later recalled overhearing Downing excitedly sharing the news over the phone with Wolfowitz and Feith .
" I had the feeling they were high - five - ing each other , " the White House official said .
" I had the feeling they were high - five - ing each other . "
By a wonderful coincidence , " five " is also the number of people killed by the anthrax :
Robert Stevens
Kathy Nguyen
Ottilie Lundgren
Thomas Morris Jr .
Joseph Curseen .
How happy they would have been to know their deaths would be the cause of celebration in the halls of power .
And how lovely that after Wolfowitz & co. found they could n't use the murder of their fellow Americans to start a war , they lost all interest in who actually HAD killed them .
If you can think of any jokes about this , I encourage you to share them .
I got nothing .
They do n’t call them the Associated Pravda for nothing .
AP has become a shell of its former self .
They used to do journalism .
Now they ’re little more than stenographers , reprinting any assertion , however outlandish , from the Bush administration as fact .
For example :
“ We ’re fighting a war over there because the enemy attacked us first , ” Cheney said .
Iraq had nothing to with September 11 .
Why did AP fail to mention that ?
The terrorism fight now centers on Iraq , the vice president said , because that is where the enemy has massed .
The war in Iraq started before the “ enemy ” was amassed there .
Again , AP could n’t mention this ?
He promised that the Army will have all the manpower , equipment and support it needs .
This , the same day we learn that the Bush administration refused to give our troops IED - proof vehicles because the Bushies were too cheap .
In AP ’s eyes , one assumes , it would be biased of them to challenge Cheney ’s lies .
They see their job as the daily stenographers of the administration ’s latest tales .
They are simply unable to look at any of their stories in a larger context , going so far as to contradict their own previous stories because to reference those previous stories , to note facts that prove the administration ’s latest assertions to be untrue , is somehow “ biased . ”
Yes , the truth is now “ biased . ”
So AP simply reprints the lies , unchallenged .
Who needs FAX machines when we can read partisan press releases on AP .
New York Timesvia PottersvilleSix years ago a man unsuited both by intellect and by temperament for high office somehow ended up running the country .
How did that happen ?
First , he got the Republican nomination by locking up the big money early .
Then , he got within chad-and - butterfly range of the White House because the public , enthusiastically encouraged by many in the news media , treated the presidential election like a high school popularity contest .
The successful candidate received kid -gloves treatment — and a free pass on the fuzzy math of his policy proposals — because he seemed like a fun guy to hang out with , while the unsuccessful candidate was subjected to sniggering mockery over his clothing and his mannerisms .
Today , with thousands of Americans and tens of thousands of Iraqis dead thanks to presidential folly , with Al Qaeda resurgent and Afghanistan on the brink , you ’d think we would have learned a lesson .
But the early signs are n’t encouraging .

Barack Obama has chosen not to attend September 's Democratic presidential primary debate co-sponsored by the Congressional Black Caucus Institute and Fox News , an aide said , effectively dooming the event .
Obama is the only member of the Congressional Black Caucus running for President , and his decision allows other candidates to skip the debate without facing criticism that they are turning their backs on a leading black institution .
Friday , John Edwards was the first candidate to announce he'd skip the debate .
The CBC Institute is hosting one other debate , with CNN in January , in which all candidates are expected to participate .
" CNN seemed like a more appropriate venue , " the aide said , adding that Obama himself had not called CBC leadership or Fox executives to deliver the news .
" It was handled at a staff level . "
The aide said that Obama will participate in the six officially - sanctioned Democratic National Committee debates , whose existence provided candidates a measure of cover to drop out of the Fox - sponsored debate .
A Fox News spokesman did n't immediately return a call and email seeking a reaction .

Feb. 26 , 2007  --
A record number of Americans disapprove of the war in Iraq , and a clear majority now favors the eventual withdrawal of U.S. forces , even if civil order has not been restored there -- potentially a tipping point in public attitudes on the war .
While solutions remain vexing , for the first time ABC News / Washington Post polls show a narrow majority of Americans support setting a deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. forces .
Two - thirds oppose George W. Bush 's troop surge ; most oppose it strongly .
It all makes for a continued hard slog for the president : Just 36 percent approve of his job performance overall , very near his career low of 33 percent last month .
Bush has n't seen majority approval in more than two years -- the longest run without majority support for any president since Harry Truman from 1950 - 53 .
While rooted in Iraq , Bush 's problems with credibility and confidence reach beyond it .
Sixty - three percent of Americans do n't trust the administration to convey intelligence reports on potential threats from other countries honestly and accurately .
And 58 percent lack confidence , specifically , in its ability to handle current tensions with Iran .
Iraq Weighs on President 's Popularity
Bush is paying the continued price of an unpopular war .
Sixty - four percent now say the war in Iraq was not worth fighting , up six points from last month to a new numerical high .
( It was 63 percent in October . )
A majority has n't said the war was worth fighting since April 2004 , and it 's been even longer since a majority has approved of how Bush is handling it .
Sixty - seven percent now disapprove ; 55 percent disapprove strongly .
In a fundamental change , 56 percent now say U.S. forces should be withdrawn at some point even if civil order has not been restored in Iraq .
That represents a continued , gradual departure from the " you break it , you 've bought it " sentiment that until now has mitigated in favor of continued U.S. involvement until some stability is attained .
Another part of this change has been a shift in views on setting a withdrawal date .
Given pro and con positions ( avoiding casualties vs. encouraging insurgents ) , support for a deadline has risen from 39 percent in late 2005 to 47 percent last summer and 53 percent now .
That 's a majority , but not a large one ; 46 percent still oppose a deadline , underscoring the difficulty of finding consensus on how to get out of Iraq .
Among those who do support a deadline , 85 percent said it should be within the next year ( including 46 percent who said it should be within the next six months ) , essentially unchanged from previous polls .
( Questions on troop withdrawal deadlines depend on the options offered . )
The Blame Game : Advantage Democrats
Views on Iraq are accompanied by a broad sense that the main blame for failing to control the violence in Iraq rests with its own government ( 70 percent say so ) , not the United States ( 18 percent ) .
Indeed , two - thirds favor reducing U.S. military and financial support if the Iraqis fail to make progress restoring order -- one of the popular steps proposed by the Iraq Study Group in December , but not taken up by Bush .
( Another is the group 's proposal for a shift to a military training mission , with most U.S. combat forces withdrawn by early 2008 ; at the time of the proposal , 69 percent supported it . )
The Democrats in Congress continue to hold the upper hand on Iraq ( as well as more generally ) , but slightly less so than last month .
Then 60 percent of Americans trusted the Democrats over Bush to handle the war ; today , it 's 54 percent .
The current political wrangling over Iraq may be a cause , as well as an almost inevitable comedown from the Democrats ' election victory in November .
While 50 percent still approve of Nancy Pelosi 's work as House speaker , her disapproval is up by six points , to 31 percent .
( Comparing powerful Washington women , she 's bettered by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , with 58 percent approval .
Both vastly outshine Bush . )
One Democratic proposal on Iraq -- to block Bush 's surge by changing troop rotation rules -- wins 58 percent support .
But another -- restricting funding for the war in an effort to block the surge -- is more divisive , with 46 percent in favor and a slim majority , 51 percent , opposed .
Military funding is sensitive with troops in the field .
The Democrats continue to lead Bush in other areas as well , including a 52 - 39 percent advantage in trust to handle terrorism ( once Bush 's cornerstone issue , a majority has disapproved of his work on terrorism steadily since October ) .
The Democrats lead by wider margins in trust to handle the economy , despite its relatively good condition ; the federal budget ; and health care , with no gain for Bush from his State of the Union proposal to move health insurance tax breaks from corporations to individuals .
Iran's Role
The public divides about evenly on whether or not the administration has solid evidence that Iran is supporting insurgent attacks on U.S. forces .
As noted , though , more broadly , 63 percent do n't trust the administration to report intelligence on threats from foreign nations honestly and accurately .
That lack of trust can make it very hard to marshal public support when needed .
Nearly six in 10 also say they 're not confident the administration will do a good job of handling the tensions with Iran .
Just 11 percent are very confident it will handle this issue well ; three times as many , 34 percent , are not confident at all .
Underscoring his problems , even among Republicans , just 28 percent are very confident in Bush 's ability to deal with Iran , while among Democrats , 55 percent have no confidence whatsoever .
The Fight for Afghanistan
Views on the war in Afghanistan stand in contrast to those on Iraq .
A majority of Americans , 56 percent , say the war in Afghanistan was worth fighting , 22 points more than say that about the Iraq War .
But given broader , negative sentiment , there 's hardly robust support for expanded U.S. commitment in Afghanistan : Six in 10 say the United States is " doing enough " to help rebuild that county .
If there 's a strong case for expanded U.S. support for Afghanistan , as the administration has proposed , most Americans have n't been persuaded .
Longest Streak Since Truman
As noted , Bush has n't received majority approval in any ABC / Post poll in the last two years -- specifically in 25 months , since Jan. 16 , 2005 .
Compared with ABC / Post polls since the Reagan presidency , and Gallup polls before them , that 's the longest run with less than majority approval for any president since Truman .
It 's worth noting not just the length and breadth but also the continued depth of Bush 's unpopularity .
Barely two in 10 Americans ( 19 percent ) strongly approve of his job performance , while 49 percent strongly disapprove .
As noted , 55 percent strongly disapprove of his work on Iraq , while just 17 percent strongly approve .
And in a more personal measure , 29 percent are " angry " about the administration 's work in Iraq , while just 7 percent are pleased .
And beyond customary partisanship , there are other sharp differences between groups , though partisanship fuels some of them .
Among blacks , for example , just 9 percent approve of Bush 's job performance , and just 11 percent say that , given its costs versus benefits , the war was worth fighting .
This is largely ( but not exclusively ) because blacks overwhelmingly are Democrats .
( Among Democrats , 8 percent approve of Bush , and the same number call the war worth fighting . )
In addition to blacks , sentiment against the war peaks among women and young adults .
Sixty - three percent of women and 67 percent of people under 30 favor withdrawing U.S. forces even if civil order is not restored .
Many fewer men ( 48 percent ) or older adults ( 53 percent ) agree .

Problems with our health care system are leading some to fall prey to proposals calling for a nationalized single - payer health care system like Canada 's or Britain's .
There are a few things that we might take into consideration before falling for these proposals .
London 's Observer ( 3/3/02 ) carried a story saying that an " unpublished report shows some patients are now having to wait more than eight months for treatment , during which time many of their cancers become incurable . "
Another story said , " According to a World Health Organisation report to be published later this year , around 10,000 British people die unnecessarily from cancer each year -- three times as many as are killed on our roads . "
The Observer ( 12/16/01 ) also reported , " A recent academic study showed National Health Service delays in bowel cancer treatment were so great that , in one in five cases , cancer which was curable at the time of diagnosis had become incurable by the time of treatment . "
The story is no better in Canada 's national health care system .
The Vancouver , British Columbia - based Fraser Institute has a yearly publication titled , " Waiting Your Turn . "
Its 2006 edition gives waiting times , by treatments , from a person 's referral by a general practitioner to treatment by a specialist .
The shortest waiting time was for oncology ( 4.9 weeks ) .
The longest waiting time was for orthopedic surgery ( 40.3 weeks ) , followed by plastic surgery ( 35.4 weeks ) and neurosurgery ( 31.7 weeks ) .
Canadians face significant waiting times for various diagnostics such as computed tomography ( CT ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) and ultrasound scans .
The median wait for a CT scan across Canada was 4.3 weeks , but in Prince Edward Island , it 's 9 weeks .
A Canadian 's median wait for an MRI was 10.3 weeks , but in Newfoundland , patients waited 28 weeks .
Finally , the median wait for an ultrasound was 3.8 weeks across Canada , but in Manitoba and Prince Edward Island it was 8 weeks .
Despite the long waiting times Canadians suffer , sometimes resulting in death , under federal law , private clinics are not legally allowed to provide services covered by the Canada Health Act .
Regardless of this prohibition , a few black - market clinics service patients who are willing to break the law to get treatment .
In British Columbia , for example , Bill 82 provides that a physician can be fined up to $ 20,000 for accepting fees for surgery .
According to a Canada News article , " Shortage of Doctors and Nurses Could Hurt Medicare Reforms " ( 3/5/03 ) , about 10,000 doctors left Canada during the 1990s .
There 's help for some Canadian patients .
According to a Canadian Medical Association Journal article , " U.S. Hospitals Use Waiting - List Woes to Woo Canadians " ( 2/22/2000 ) , " British Columbia patients fed up with sojourns on waiting lists as they await tests or treatment are being wooed by a hospital in Washington state that has begun offering package deals .
A second U.S. hospital is also considering marketing its services . "
One of the attractions is that an MRI , which can take anywhere from 10 to 28 weeks in Canada , can be had in two days at Olympic Memorial Hospital in Port Angeles , Wash .
Already , Cleveland is Canada 's hip - replacement center .
Some of our politicians hold up the Canadian and British nationalized health care systems as models for us .
You can bet that should we ever have such a system , they would exempt themselves from what the rest of us would have to endure .
There 's a cure for our health care problems .
That cure is not to demand more government but less government .
I challenge anyone to identify a problem with health care in America that is not caused or aggravated by federal , state and local governments .
And , I challenge anyone to show me people dying on the streets because they do n't have health insurance .
WASHINGTON , Dec. 19 - Counterterrorism agents at the Federal Bureau of Investigation have conducted numerous surveillance and intelligence - gathering operations that involved , at least indirectly , groups active in causes as diverse as the environment , animal cruelty and poverty relief , newly disclosed agency records show .
F.B.I. officials said Monday that their investigators had no interest in monitoring political or social activities and that any investigations that touched on advocacy groups were driven by evidence of criminal or violent activity at public protests and in other settings .
After the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , John Ashcroft , who was then attorney general , loosened restrictions on the F.B.I.'s investigative powers , giving the bureau greater ability to visit and monitor Web sites , mosques and other public entities in developing terrorism leads .
The bureau has used that authority to investigate not only groups with suspected ties to foreign terrorists , but also protest groups suspected of having links to violent or disruptive activities .
But the documents , coming after the Bush administration 's confirmation that President Bush had authorized some spying without warrants in fighting terrorism , prompted charges from civil rights advocates that the government had improperly blurred the line between terrorism and acts of civil disobedience and lawful protest .
Introduction [ edit ]
This chapter explains how to formalize the meaning of Haskell programs , the denotational semantics .
It may seem to be nit - picking to formally specify that the program square x = x*x means the same as the mathematical square function that maps each number to its square , but what about the meaning of a program like f x = f ( x+1 ) that loops forever ?
In the following , we will exemplify the approach first taken by Scott and Strachey to this question and obtain a foundation to reason about the correctness of functional programs in general and recursive definitions in particular .
Of course , we will concentrate on those topics needed to understand Haskell programs . [ 1 ]
Another aim of this chapter is to illustrate the notions strict and lazy that capture the idea that a function needs or needs not to evaluate its argument .
This is a basic ingredient to predict the course of evaluation of Haskell programs and hence of primary interest to the programmer .
Interestingly , these notions can be formulated concisely with denotational semantics alone , no reference to an execution model is necessary .
They will be put to good use in Graph Reduction , but it is this chapter that will familiarize the reader with the denotational definition and involved notions such as ⊥ ( " Bottom " ) .
The reader only interested in strictness may wish to poke around in section Bottom and Partial Functions and quickly head over to Strict and Non-Strict Semantics .
What is Denotational Semantics and what is it for ? [ edit ]
What does a Haskell program mean ?
This question is answered by the denotational semantics of Haskell .
In general , the denotational semantics of a programming language maps each of its programs to a mathematical object ( denotation ) , that represents the meaning of the program in question .
As an example , the mathematical object for the Haskell programs 10 , 9+1 , 2* 5 and sum [ 1..4 ] can be represented by the integer 10 .
We say that all those programs denote the integer 10 .
The collection of such mathematical objects is called the semantic domain .
The mapping from program code to a semantic domain is commonly written down with double square brackets ( " Oxford brackets " ) around program code .
For example ,
[ [ 2*5 ] ] = 10 . {\displaystyle [ \![ {\texttt { 2*5}} ] \!]
=10.}
Denotations are compositional , i.e. the meaning of a program like 1+9 only depends on the meaning of its constituents :
[ [ a+b ] ] = [ [ a ] ] + [ [ b ] ] .
{\displaystyle [ \![ {\texttt { a+b}} ] \! ]=[\![ {\texttt {a}} ] \!]+[\![ {\texttt { b}} ] \! ].}
The same notation is used for types , i.e .
[ [ Integer ] ] = Z . {\displaystyle [ \![ {\texttt { Integer}} ] \!]=\mathbb { Z} .}
For simplicity however , we will silently identify expressions with their semantic objects in subsequent chapters and use this notation only when clarification is needed .
It is one of the key properties of purely functional languages like Haskell that a direct mathematical interpretation like " 1+9 denotes 10 " carries over to functions , too : in essence , the denotation of a program of type Integer ->
Integer is a mathematical function Z → Z {\displaystyle \mathbb { Z} \to \mathbb { Z} } between integers .
While we will see that this expression needs refinement generally , to include non-termination , the situation for imperative languages is clearly worse : a procedure with that type denotes something that changes the state of a machine in possibly unintended ways .
Imperative languages are tightly tied to operational semantics which describes their way of execution on a machine .
It is possible to define a denotational semantics for imperative programs and to use it to reason about such programs , but the semantics often has operational nature and sometimes must be extended in comparison to the denotational semantics for functional languages .
[ 2 ]
In contrast , the meaning of purely functional languages is by default completely independent from their way of execution .
The Haskell98 standard even goes as far as to specify only Haskell 's non-strict denotational semantics , leaving open how to implement them .
In the end , denotational semantics enables us to develop formal proofs that programs indeed do what we want them to do mathematically .
Ironically , for proving program properties in day - to - day Haskell , one can use Equational reasoning , which transforms programs into equivalent ones without seeing much of the underlying mathematical objects we are concentrating on in this chapter .
But the denotational semantics actually show up whenever we have to reason about non-terminating programs , for instance in Infinite Lists .
Of course , because they only state what a program is , denotational semantics cannot answer questions about how long a program takes or how much memory it eats ; this is governed by the evaluation strategy which dictates how the computer calculates the normal form of an expression .
On the other hand , the implementation has to respect the semantics , and to a certain extent , it is the semantics that determines how Haskell programs must be evaluated on a machine .
We will elaborate on this in Strict and Non-Strict Semantics .
What to choose as Semantic Domain ? [ edit ]
We are now looking for suitable mathematical objects that we can attribute to every Haskell program .
In case of the example 10 , 2 * 5 and sum [ 1..4 ] , it is clear that all expressions should denote the integer 10 .
Generalizing , every value x of type Integer is likely to denote an element of the set Z {\displaystyle \mathbb { Z} } .
The same can be done with values of type Bool .
For functions like f :: Integer ->
Integer , we can appeal to the mathematical definition of " function " as a set of ( argument , value ) - pairs , its graph .
But interpreting functions as their graph was too quick , because it does not work well with recursive definitions .
Consider the definition
shaves :: Integer -> Integer ->
Bool 1 `shaves` 1 = True 2 `shaves` 2 = False 0 `shaves` x = not ( x `shaves` x ) _ `shaves` _ = False
We can think of 0 , 1 and 2 as being male persons with long beards and the question is who shaves whom .
Person 1 shaves himself , but 2 gets shaved by the barber 0 because evaluating the third equation yields 0 `shaves` 2 == True .
In general , the third line says that the barber 0 shaves all persons that do not shave themselves .
What about the barber himself , is 0 `shaves` 0 true or not ?
If it is , then the third equation says that it is not .
If it is not , then the third equation says that it is .
Puzzled , we see that we just cannot attribute True or False to 0 `shaves` 0 ; the graph we use as interpretation for the function shaves must have an empty spot .
We realize that our semantic objects must be able to incorporate partial functions , functions that are undefined for some values of their arguments (.. that is otherwise permitted by the arguments ' types ) .
It is well known that this famous example gave rise to serious foundational problems in set theory .
It 's an example of an impredicative definition , a definition which uses itself , a logical circle .
Unfortunately for recursive definitions , the circle is not the problem but the feature .
Bottom and Partial Functions [ edit ]
⊥ Bottom [ edit ]
To define partial functions , we introduce a special value ⊥ , named bottom and commonly written _|_ in typewriter font .
We say that ⊥ is the completely " undefined " value or function .
Every basic data type like Integer or ( ) contains one ⊥ besides their usual elements .
So the possible values of type Integer are
⊥ , 0 , + 1 , − 1 , + 2 , − 2 , + 3 , − 3 , … {\displaystyle \bot ,0,+1, -1,+2,-2,+3 , -3 , \dots }
Adding ⊥ to the set of values is also called lifting .
This is often depicted by a subscript like in Z ⊥ {\displaystyle \mathbb { Z} _{\bot }} .
While this is the correct notation for the mathematical set " lifted integers " , we prefer to talk about " values of type Integer " .
We do this because Z ⊥ {\displaystyle \mathbb { Z} _{\bot }} suggests that there are " real " integers Z {\displaystyle \mathbb { Z} } , but inside Haskell , the " integers " are Integer .
As another example , the type ( ) with only one element actually has two inhabitants :
⊥ , ( ) {\displaystyle \bot , ( ) }
For now , we will stick to programming with Integer s. Arbitrary algebraic data types will be treated in section Algebraic Data Types since strict and non-strict languages diverge on how these include ⊥ .
In Haskell , the expression undefined denotes ⊥.
With its help , one can indeed verify some semantic properties of actual Haskell programs .
undefined has the polymorphic type forall a .
a which of course can be specialized to undefined :: Integer , undefined :: ( ) , undefined :: Integer ->
Integer and so on .
In the Haskell Prelude , it is defined as
undefined = error " Prelude.undefined "
As a side note , it follows from the Curry - Howard isomorphism that any value of the polymorphic type forall a .
a must denote ⊥ .
Partial Functions and the Semantic Approximation Order [ edit ]
Now , ⊥ {\displaystyle \bot } gives us the possibility to have partial functions :
f ( n ) = { 1 if n is 0 − 2 if n is 1 ⊥ else {\displaystyle f(n ) ={\begin{cases}1&{\mbox { if }}n{\mbox { is }}0 \\ - 2&{\mbox { if }}n{\mbox{ is }}1 \ \\bot &{\mbox { else }}\end {cases}}}
Here , f ( n ) {\displaystyle f( n ) } yields well defined values for n = 0 {\displaystyle n=0} and n = 1 {\displaystyle n=1 } but gives ⊥ {\displaystyle \bot } for all other n {\displaystyle n} .
The type Integer ->
Integer has its ⊥ {\displaystyle \bot } too , and it is defined with the help of the ⊥ {\displaystyle \bot } from Integer this way :
⊥ ( n ) = ⊥ {\displaystyle \bot ( n ) =\bot } n {\displaystyle n}
where the ⊥ {\displaystyle \bot } on the left hand side is of type Integer ->
Integer , and the one right hand side is of type Integer .
To formalize , partial functions say , of type Integer ->
Integer are at least mathematical mappings from the lifted integers Z ⊥ = { ⊥ , 0 , ± 1 , ± 2 , ± 3 , … } {\displaystyle \mathbb { Z} _{\bot }=\{\bot , 0 , \pm 1 , \pm 2 , \pm 3 , \dots \}} to the lifted integers .
But this is not enough , since it does not acknowledge the special role of ⊥ {\displaystyle \bot } .
For example , the definition
g ( n ) = { 1 if n is ⊥ ⊥ else {\displaystyle g(n ) ={\begin{cases}1&{\mbox { if }}n{\mbox { is }}\bot \\\bot &{\mbox { else }}\end {cases}}}
is a function that turns infinite loops into terminating programs and vice versa , which is solving the halting problem .
How can g ( ⊥ ) {\displaystyle g( \bot ) } yield a defined value when g ( 1 ) {\displaystyle g( 1 ) } is undefined ?
The intuition is that every partial function g {\displaystyle g} should yield more defined answers for more defined arguments .
To formalize , we can say that every concrete number is more defined than ⊥ {\displaystyle \bot } :
⊥ ⊏ 1 , ⊥ ⊏ 2 , … {\displaystyle \bot \sqsubset 1\ , \ \bot \sqsubset 2\ , \dots }
Here , a ⊏ b {\displaystyle a\sqsubset b} denotes that b {\displaystyle b} is more defined than a {\displaystyle a} .
Likewise , a ⊑ b {\displaystyle a\sqsubseteq b} will denote that either b {\displaystyle b} is more defined than a {\displaystyle a} or both are equal ( and so have the same definedness ) .
⊏ {\displaystyle \sqsubset } is also called the semantic approximation order because we can approximate defined values by less defined ones thus interpreting " more defined " as " approximating better " .
Of course , ⊥ {\displaystyle \bot } is designed to be the least element of a data type , we always have that ⊥ ⊏ x {\displaystyle \bot \sqsubset x} for all x {\displaystyle x} , except the case when x {\displaystyle x} happens to denote ⊥ {\displaystyle \bot } itself :
∀ x ≠ ⊥ ⊥ ⊏ x {\displaystyle \forall x
eq \bot \ \ \ \bot \sqsubset x}
As no number is more defined than another , the mathematical relation ⊏ {\displaystyle \sqsubset } is false for any pair of numbers :
1 ⊏ 1 {\displaystyle 1\sqsubset 1}
neither 1 ⊏ 2 {\displaystyle 1\sqsubset 2} 2 ⊏ 1 {\displaystyle 2\sqsubset 1}
This is contrasted to ordinary order predicate ≤ {\displaystyle \leq } , which can compare any two numbers .
A quick way to remember this is the sentence : " 1 {\displaystyle 1} and 2 {\displaystyle 2} are different in terms of information content but are equal in terms of information quantity " .
That 's another reason why we use a different symbol : ⊑ {\displaystyle \sqsubseteq } .
neither 1 ⊑ 2 {\displaystyle 1\sqsubseteq 2} 2 ⊑ 1 {\displaystyle 2\sqsubseteq 1}
but 1 ⊑ 1 {\displaystyle 1\sqsubseteq 1}
One says that ⊑ {\displaystyle \sqsubseteq } specifies a partial order and that the values of type Integer form a partially ordered set ( poset for short ) .
A partial order is characterized by the following three laws
Reflexivity , everything is just as defined as itself : x ⊑ x {\displaystyle x\sqsubseteq x} x {\displaystyle x}
, everything is just as defined as itself : Transitivity : if x ⊑ y {\displaystyle x\sqsubseteq y} y ⊑ z {\displaystyle y\sqsubseteq z} x ⊑ z {\displaystyle x\sqsubseteq z}
: if Antisymmetry : if both x ⊑ y {\displaystyle x\sqsubseteq y} y ⊑ x {\displaystyle y\sqsubseteq x} x {\displaystyle x} y {\displaystyle y} x = y {\displaystyle x=y}
Exercises
Do the integers form a poset with respect to the order ≤ {\displaystyle \leq }
We can depict the order ⊑ {\displaystyle \sqsubseteq } on the values of type Integer by the following graph
where every link between two nodes specifies that the one above is more defined than the one below .
Because there is only one level ( excluding ⊥ {\displaystyle \bot } ) , one says that Integer is a flat domain .
The picture also explains the name of ⊥ {\displaystyle \bot } : it 's called bottom because it always sits at the bottom .
Monotonicity [ edit ]
Our intuition about partial functions now can be formulated as following : every partial function f {\displaystyle f} is a monotone mapping between partially ordered sets .
More defined arguments will yield more defined values :
x ⊑ y ⇒ f ( x ) ⊑ f ( y ) {\displaystyle x\sqsubseteq y\ Rightarrow f( x ) \sqsubseteq f(y ) }
In particular , a monotone function h {\displaystyle h} with h ( ⊥ ) = 1 {\displaystyle h( \bot ) =1} is constant : h ( n ) = 1 {\displaystyle h( n ) =1} for all n {\displaystyle n} .
Note that here it is crucial that 1 ⊑ 2 {\displaystyle 1 \sqsubseteq 2} etc. do n't hold .
Translated to Haskell , monotonicity means that we cannot use ⊥ {\displaystyle \bot } as a condition , i.e. we cannot pattern match on ⊥ {\displaystyle \bot } , or its equivalent undefined .
Otherwise , the example g {\displaystyle g} from above could be expressed as a Haskell program .
As we shall see later , ⊥ {\displaystyle \bot } also denotes non-terminating programs , so that the inability to observe ⊥ {\displaystyle \bot } inside Haskell is related to the halting problem .
Of course , the notion of more defined than can be extended to partial functions by saying that a function is more defined than another if it is so at every possible argument :
f ⊑ g if ∀ x . f ( x ) ⊑ g ( x ) {\displaystyle f\sqsubseteq g{\mbox { if }}\forall x.f( x ) \sqsubseteq g( x ) }
Thus , the partial functions also form a poset , with the undefined function ⊥ ( x ) = ⊥ {\displaystyle \bot ( x ) =\bot } being the least element .
Recursive Definitions as Fixed Point Iterations [ edit ]
Approximations of the Factorial Function [ edit ]
Now that we have the means to describe partial functions , we can give an interpretation to recursive definitions .
Let 's take the prominent example of the factorial function f ( n ) = n ! {\displaystyle f( n ) =n!} whose recursive definition is
f ( n ) = if n == 0 then 1 else n ⋅ f ( n − 1 ) {\displaystyle f( n ) ={\mbox { if }}n==0{\mbox { then }}1 { \mbox{ else }}n\cdot f ( n - 1 ) }
Although we saw that interpreting this recursive function directly as a set description may lead to problems , we intuitively know that in order to calculate f ( n ) {\displaystyle f( n ) } for every given n {\displaystyle n} we have to iterate the right hand side .
This iteration can be formalized as follows : we calculate a sequence of functions f k {\displaystyle f_{k}} with the property that each function consists of the right hand side applied to the previous function , that is
f k + 1 ( n ) = if n == 0 then 1 else n ⋅ f k ( n − 1 ) {\displaystyle f_{k +
1} ( n ) ={\mbox { if }}n==0{\mbox { then }}1 { \mbox{ else }}n\cdot f_{k} ( n - 1 ) }
We start with the undefined function f 0 ( n ) = ⊥ {\displaystyle f_{0 }( n ) =\bot } , and the resulting sequence of partial functions reads :
f 1 ( n ) = { 1 if n is 0 ⊥ else , f 2 ( n ) = { 1 if n is 0 1 if n is 1 ⊥ else , f 3 ( n ) = { 1 if n is 0 1 if n is 1 2 if n is 2 ⊥ else {\displaystyle f_{1}(n)={\begin{cases}1&{\mbox { if }}n{\mbox { is }}0 \ \\bot &{\mbox { else }}\end {cases}}\ , \ f_{2}(n)={\begin{cases}1&{\mbox { if }}n{\mbox{ is }}0 \ \1&{\mbox { if }}n{\mbox{ is }}1 \ \\bot &{\mbox { else }}\end {cases}}\ , \ f_{3}(n)={\begin{cases}1&{\mbox { if }}n{\mbox{ is }}0 \ \1&{\mbox { if }}n{\mbox{ is }}1 \ \2&{\mbox { if }}n{\mbox { is }}2 \\\bot &{\mbox { else }}\end {cases}}}
and so on .
Clearly ,
⊥ = f 0 ⊑ f 1 ⊑ f 2 ⊑ … {\displaystyle \bot =f_{0}\sqsubseteq f_{1}\sqsubseteq f_{2}\sqsubseteq \dots }
and we expect that the sequence converges to the factorial function .
The iteration follows the well known scheme of a fixed point iteration
x 0 , g ( x 0 ) , g ( g ( x 0 ) ) , g ( g ( g ( x 0 ) ) ) , … {\displaystyle x_{0}, g( x_{0} ) , g( g( x_{0} ) ) , g( g( g( x_{0} ) ) ) , \dots }
In our case , x 0 {\displaystyle x_{0}} is a function and g {\displaystyle g} is a functional , a mapping between functions .
We have
x 0 = ⊥ {\displaystyle x_{0}= \bot } g ( x ) = n ↦ if n == 0 then 1 else n ∗ x ( n − 1 ) {\displaystyle g(x ) =n\mapsto {\mbox { if }}n==0 { \mbox { then }}1 { \mbox{ else }}n *x ( n - 1 ) \, }
If we start with x 0 = ⊥ {\displaystyle x_{0}= \bot } , the iteration will yield increasingly defined approximations to the factorial function
⊥ ⊑ g ( ⊥ ) ⊑ g ( g ( ⊥ ) ) ⊑ g ( g ( g ( ⊥ ) ) ) ⊑ … {\displaystyle \bot \sqsubseteq g( \bot ) \sqsubseteq g( g( \bot ) ) \sqsubseteq g( g( g ( \bot ) ) ) \sqsubseteq \dots }
( Proof that the sequence increases :
The first inequality ⊥ ⊑ g ( ⊥ ) {\displaystyle \bot \sqsubseteq g( \bot ) } follows from the fact that ⊥ {\displaystyle \bot } is less defined than anything else .
The second inequality follows from the first one by applying g {\displaystyle g} to both sides and noting that g {\displaystyle g} is monotone .
The third follows from the second in the same fashion and so on . )
It is very illustrative to formulate this iteration scheme in Haskell .
As functionals are just ordinary higher order functions , we have
g :: ( Integer -> Integer ) -> ( Integer -> Integer ) g x =
-> if n == 0 then 1 else n * x ( n - 1 ) x0 :: Integer ->
Integer x0 = undefined ( f0:f1:f2:f3:f4:fs ) = iterate g x0
We can now evaluate the functions f0 , f1 , ... at sample arguments and see whether they yield undefined or not :
> f3 0 1 > f3 1 1 > f3 2 2 > f3 5 *** Exception : Prelude.undefined > map f3 [ 0 .. ]
[ 1,1,2,*** Exception : Prelude.undefined > map f4 [ 0 .. ]
[ 1,1,2,6,***
Exception : Prelude.undefined > map f1 [ 0 .. ]
[ 1,***
Exception : Prelude.undefined
Of course , we cannot use this to check whether f4 is really undefined for all arguments .
Convergence [ edit ]
To the mathematician , the question whether this sequence of approximations converges is still to be answered .
For that , we say that a poset is a directed complete partial order ( dcpo ) iff every monotone sequence x 0 ⊑ x 1 ⊑ … {\displaystyle x_{0} \sqsubseteq x_{1}\sqsubseteq \dots } ( also called chain ) has a least upper bound ( supremum )
sup ⊑ { x 0 ⊑ x 1 ⊑ … } = x {\displaystyle \sup _{\sqsubseteq }\{x_{0} \sqsubseteq x_{1}\sqsubseteq \dots \}=x}
If that 's the case for the semantic approximation order , we clearly can be sure that monotone sequence of functions approximating the factorial function indeed has a limit .
For our denotational semantics , we will only meet dcpos which have a least element ⊥ {\displaystyle \bot } which are called complete partial orders ( cpo ) .
The Integer s clearly form a ( d ) cpo , because the monotone sequences consisting of more than one element must be of the form
⊥ ⊑ ⋯ ⊑ ⊥ ⊑ n ⊑ n ⊑ ⋯ ⊑ n {\displaystyle \bot \sqsubseteq \dots \sqsubseteq \ \bot \sqsubseteq n\sqsubseteq n\sqsubseteq \dots \sqsubseteq n}
where n {\displaystyle n} is an ordinary number .
Thus , n {\displaystyle n} is already the least upper bound .
For functions Integer ->
Integer , this argument fails because monotone sequences may be of infinite length .
But because Integer is a ( d ) cpo , we know that for every point n {\displaystyle n} , there is a least upper bound
sup ⊑ { ⊥ = f 0 ( n ) ⊑ f 1 ( n ) ⊑ f 2 ( n ) ⊑ … } = : f ( n ) {\displaystyle \sup _{\sqsubseteq }\{\bot = f_{0}(n ) \sqsubseteq f_{1}(n ) \sqsubseteq f_{2}(n ) \sqsubseteq \dots \}=:f( n) }
As the semantic approximation order is defined point - wise , the function f {\displaystyle f} is the supremum we looked for .
These have been the last touches for our aim to transform the impredicative definition of the factorial function into a well defined construction .
Of course , it remains to be shown that f ( n ) {\displaystyle f( n ) } actually yields a defined value for every n {\displaystyle n} , but this is not hard and far more reasonable than a completely ill - formed definition .
Bottom includes Non-Termination [ edit ]
It is instructive to try our newly gained insight into recursive definitions on an example that does not terminate :
f ( n ) = f ( n + 1 ) {\displaystyle f( n ) =f( n+1 ) }
The approximating sequence reads
f 0 = ⊥ , f 1 = ⊥ , … {\displaystyle f_{0}=\bot , f_{1}=\bot , \dots }
and consists only of ⊥ {\displaystyle \bot } .
Clearly , the resulting limit is ⊥ {\displaystyle \bot } again .
From an operational point of view , a machine executing this program will loop indefinitely .
We thus see that ⊥ {\displaystyle \bot } may also denote a non-terminating function or value .
Hence , given the halting problem , pattern matching on ⊥ {\displaystyle \bot } in Haskell is impossible .
Interpretation as Least Fixed Point [ edit ]
Earlier , we called the approximating sequence an example of the well known " fixed point iteration " scheme .
And of course , the definition of the factorial function f {\displaystyle f} can also be thought as the specification of a fixed point of the functional g {\displaystyle g} :
f = g ( f ) = n ↦ if n == 0 then 1 else n ⋅ f ( n − 1 ) {\displaystyle f=g( f ) =n\mapsto {\mbox { if }}n==0 {\mbox { then }}1 { \mbox{ else }}n\cdot f ( n - 1 ) }
However , there might be multiple fixed points .
For instance , there are several f {\displaystyle f} which fulfill the specification
f = n ↦ if n == 0 then 1 else f ( n + 1 ) {\displaystyle f=n\mapsto {\mbox{ if }}n==0 { \mbox { then }}1 { \mbox{ else }}f ( n+1 ) }
Of course , when executing such a program , the machine will loop forever on f ( 1 ) {\displaystyle f( 1 ) } or f ( 2 ) {\displaystyle f( 2 ) } and thus not produce any valuable information about the value of f ( 1 ) {\displaystyle f( 1 ) } .
This corresponds to choosing the least defined fixed point as semantic object f {\displaystyle f} and this is indeed a canonical choice .
Thus , we say that
f = g ( f ) {\displaystyle f=g(f ) }
defines the least fixed point f {\displaystyle f} of g {\displaystyle g} .
Clearly , least is with respect to our semantic approximation order ⊑ {\displaystyle \sqsubseteq } .
The existence of a least fixed point is guaranteed by our iterative construction if we add the condition that g {\displaystyle g} must be continuous ( sometimes also called " chain continuous " ) .
That simply means that g {\displaystyle g} respects suprema of monotone sequences :
sup ⊑ { g ( x 0 ) ⊑ g ( x 1 ) ⊑ … } = g ( sup ⊑ { x 0 ⊑ x 1 ⊑ … } ) {\displaystyle \sup _{\sqsubseteq }\{g( x_{0} ) \sqsubseteq g(x_{1} ) \sqsubseteq \dots \}=g\left(\sup _{\sqsubseteq }\{x_{0}\sqsubseteq x_{1}\sqsubseteq \dots \}\right ) }
We can then argue that with
f = sup ⊑ { x 0 ⊑ g ( x 0 ) ⊑ g ( g ( x 0 ) ) ⊑ … } {\displaystyle f=\sup _{\sqsubseteq }\{x_{0}\sqsubseteq g( x_{0} ) \sqsubseteq g( g( x_{0} ) ) \sqsubseteq \dots \}}
we have
g ( f ) = g ( sup ⊑ { x 0 ⊑ g ( x 0 ) ⊑ g ( g ( x 0 ) ) ⊑ … } ) = sup ⊑ { g ( x 0 ) ⊑ g ( g ( x 0 ) ) ⊑ … } = sup ⊑ { x 0 ⊑ g ( x 0 ) ⊑ g ( g ( x 0 ) ) ⊑ … } = f {\displaystyle {\begin{array}{lcl}g(f ) &=&g\left(\sup _{\sqsubseteq }\{x_{0}\sqsubseteq g( x_{0} ) \sqsubseteq g( g( x_{0} ) ) \sqsubseteq \dots \}\right ) \\&=&\sup _{\sqsubseteq }\{g( x_{0} ) \sqsubseteq g(g( x_{0} ) ) \sqsubseteq \dots \}\\&=&\sup _{\sqsubseteq }\{x_{0}\sqsubseteq g(x_{0} ) \sqsubseteq g( g( x_{0} ) ) \sqsubseteq \dots \}\\&=&f\end{array}}}
and the iteration limit is indeed a fixed point of g {\displaystyle g} .
You may also want to convince yourself that the fixed point iteration yields the least fixed point possible .
Exercises
Prove that the fixed point obtained by fixed point iteration starting with x 0 = ⊥ {\displaystyle x_{0}= \bot } ⊥ {\displaystyle \bot } g {\displaystyle g}
By the way , how do we know that each Haskell function we write down indeed is continuous ?
Just as with monotonicity , this has to be enforced by the programming language .
Admittedly , these properties can somewhat be enforced or broken at will , so the question feels a bit void .
But intuitively , monotonicity is guaranteed by not allowing pattern matches on ⊥ {\displaystyle \bot } .
For continuity , we note that for an arbitrary type a , every simple function a ->
Integer is automatically continuous because the monotone sequences of Integer s are of finite length .
Any infinite chain of values of type a gets mapped to a finite chain of Integer s and respect for suprema becomes a consequence of monotonicity .
Thus , all functions of the special case Integer ->
Integer must be continuous .
For functionals like g {\displaystyle g} ::( Integer -> Integer ) -> ( Integer -> Integer ) , the continuity then materializes due to currying , as the type is isomorphic to ::(( Integer -> Integer ) , Integer ) ->
Integer and we can take a= (( Integer -> Integer ) , Integer ) .
In Haskell , the fixed interpretation of the factorial function can be coded as
factorial = fix g
with the help of the fixed point combinator
fix :: ( a -> a ) -> a .
We can define it by
fix f = let x = f x in x
which leaves us somewhat puzzled because when expanding f a c t o r i a l {\displaystyle factorial} , the result is not anything different from how we would have defined the factorial function in Haskell in the first place .
But of course , the construction this whole section was about is not at all present when running a real Haskell program .
It 's just a means to put the mathematical interpretation of Haskell programs on a firm ground .
Yet it is very nice that we can explore these semantics in Haskell itself with the help of undefined .
Strict and Non-Strict Semantics [ edit ]
After having elaborated on the denotational semantics of Haskell programs , we will drop the mathematical function notation f ( n ) {\displaystyle f( n ) } for semantic objects in favor of their now equivalent Haskell notation f n .
Strict Functions [ edit ]
A function f with one argument is called strict , if and only if
f ⊥ = ⊥ .
Here are some examples of strict functions
id x = x succ x = x + 1 power2 0 = 1 power2 n = 2 * power2 ( n - 1 )
and there is nothing unexpected about them .
But why are they strict ?
It is instructive to prove that these functions are indeed strict .
For id , this follows from the definition .
For succ , we have to ponder whether ⊥ + 1 is ⊥ or not .
If it was not , then we should for example have ⊥ + 1 = 2 or more general ⊥ + 1 = k for some concrete number k .
We remember that every function is monotone , so we should have for example
2 = ⊥ + 1 ⊑ 4 + 1 = 5
as ⊥ ⊑ 4 .
But neither of 2 ⊑ 5 , 2 = 5 nor 2 ⊒ 5 is valid so that k cannot be 2 .
In general , we obtain the contradiction
k = ⊥ + 1 ⊑ k + 1 = k + 1 .
and thus the only possible choice is
succ ⊥ = ⊥ + 1 = ⊥
and succ is strict .
Exercises Prove that power2 is strict .
While one can base the proof on the " obvious " fact that power2 n is 2 n {\displaystyle 2^ {n}}
Non-Strict and Strict Languages [ edit ]
Searching for non-strict functions , it happens that there is only one prototype of a non-strict function of type Integer ->
Integer :
one x = 1
Its variants are constk x = k for every concrete number k .
Why are these the only ones possible ?
Remember that one n can be no less defined than one ⊥ .
As Integer is a flat domain , both must be equal .
Why is one non-strict ?
To see that it is , we use a Haskell interpreter and try
> one ( undefined :: Integer ) 1
which is not ⊥.
This is reasonable as one completely ignores its argument .
When interpreting ⊥ in an operational sense as " non-termination " , one may say that the non-strictness of one means that it does not force its argument to be evaluated and therefore avoids the infinite loop when evaluating the argument ⊥.
But one might as well say that every function must evaluate its arguments before computing the result which means that one ⊥ should be ⊥ , too .
That is , if the program computing the argument does not halt , one should not halt as well .
[ 3 ]
It shows up that one can choose freely this or the other design for a functional programming language .
One says that the language is strict or non-strict depending on whether functions are strict or non-strict by default .
The choice for Haskell is non-strict .
In contrast , the functional languages ML and Lisp choose strict semantics .
Functions with several Arguments [ edit ]
The notion of strictness extends to functions with several variables .
For example , a function f of two arguments is strict in the second argument if and only if
f x ⊥ = ⊥
for every x .
But for multiple arguments , mixed forms where the strictness depends on the given value of the other arguments , are much more common .
An example is the conditional
cond b x y = if b then x else y
We see that it is strict in y depending on whether the test b is True or False :
cond True x ⊥ = x cond False x ⊥ = ⊥
and likewise for x .
Apparently , cond is certainly ⊥ if both x and y are , but not necessarily when at least one of them is defined .
This behavior is called joint strictness .
Clearly , cond behaves like the if - then - else statement where it is crucial not to evaluate both the then and the else branches :
if null xs then 'a ' else head xs if n == 0 then 1 else 5 / n
Here , the else part is ⊥ when the condition is met .
Thus , in a non -strict language , we have the possibility to wrap primitive control statements such as if - then - else into functions like cond .
This way , we can define our own control operators .
In a strict language , this is not possible as both branches will be evaluated when calling cond which makes it rather useless .
This is a glimpse of the general observation that non-strictness offers more flexibility for code reuse than strictness .
See the chapter Laziness [ 4 ] for more on this subject .
Algebraic Data Types [ edit ]
After treating the motivation case of partial functions between Integer s , we now want to extend the scope of denotational semantics to arbitrary algebraic data types in Haskell .
A word about nomenclature : the collection of semantic objects for a particular type is usually called a domain .
This term is more a generic name than a particular definition and we decide that our domains are cpos ( complete partial orders ) , that is sets of values together with a relation more defined that obeys some conditions to allow fixed point iteration .
Usually , one adds additional conditions to the cpos that ensure that the values of our domains can be represented in some finite way on a computer and thereby avoiding to ponder the twisted ways of uncountable infinite sets .
But as we are not going to prove general domain theoretic theorems , the conditions will just happen to hold by construction .
Constructors [ edit ]
Let 's take the example types
data Bool = True | False data Maybe a = Just a | Nothing
Here , True , False and Nothing are nullary constructors whereas Just is a unary constructor .
The inhabitants of Bool form the following domain :
Remember that ⊥ is added as least element to the set of values True and False , we say that the type is lifted [ 5 ] .
A domain whose poset diagram consists of only one level is called a flat domain .
We already know that I n t e g e r {\displaystyle Integer} is a flat domain as well , it 's just that the level above ⊥ has an infinite number of elements .
What are the possible inhabitants of Maybe Bool ?
They are
⊥ , Nothing , Just ⊥ , Just True , Just False
So the general rule is to insert all possible values into the unary ( binary , ternary , ... ) constructors as usual but without forgetting ⊥.
Concerning the partial order , we remember the condition that the constructors should be monotone just as any other functions .
Hence , the partial order looks as follows
But there is something to ponder : why is n't Just ⊥ = ⊥ ?
I mean " Just undefined " is as undefined as " undefined " !
The answer is that this depends on whether the language is strict or non-strict .
In a strict language , all constructors are strict by default , i.e. Just ⊥ = ⊥ and the diagram would reduce to
As a consequence , all domains of a strict language are flat .
But in a non-strict language like Haskell , constructors are non-strict by default and Just ⊥ is a new element different from ⊥ , because we can write a function that reacts differently to them :
f ( Just _ ) = 4 f Nothing = 7
As f ignores the contents of the Just constructor , f ( Just ⊥ ) is 4 but f ⊥ is ⊥ ( intuitively , if f is passed ⊥ , it will not be possible to tell whether to take the Just branch or the Nothing branch , and so ⊥ will be returned ) .
This gives rise to non-flat domains as depicted in the former graph .
What should these be of use for ?
In the context of Graph Reduction , we may also think of ⊥ as an unevaluated expression .
Thus , a value x =
Just ⊥ may tell us that a computation ( say a lookup ) succeeded and is not Nothing , but that the true value has not been evaluated yet .
If we are only interested in whether x succeeded or not , this actually saves us from the unnecessary work to calculate whether x is Just True or Just False as would be the case in a flat domain .
The full impact of non -flat domains will be explored in the chapter Laziness , but one prominent example are infinite lists treated in section Recursive Data Types and Infinite Lists .
Pattern Matching [ edit ]
In the section Strict Functions , we proved that some functions are strict by inspecting their results on different inputs and insisting on monotonicity .
However , in the light of algebraic data types , there can only be one source of strictness in real life Haskell : pattern matching , i.e. case expressions .
The general rule is that pattern matching on a constructor of a data - type will force the function to be strict , i.e. matching ⊥ against a constructor always gives ⊥.
For illustration , consider
const1 _ = 1
const1 ' True = 1 const1 ' False = 1
The first function const1 is non-strict whereas the const1 ' is strict because it decides whether the argument is True or False although its result does n't depend on that .
Pattern matching in function arguments is equivalent to case - expressions
const1 ' x = case x of True -> 1 False -> 1
which similarly impose strictness on x : if the argument to the case expression denotes ⊥ the whole case will denote ⊥ , too .
However , the argument for case expressions may be more involved as in
foo k table = case lookup ( " Foo . " ++ k ) table of Nothing -> ... Just x -> ...
and it can be difficult to track what this means for the strictness of foo .
An example for multiple pattern matches in the equational style is the logical or :
or True _ = True or _ True = True or _ _ = False
Note that equations are matched from top to bottom .
The first equation for or matches the first argument against True , so or is strict in its first argument .
The same equation also tells us that or True x is non-strict in x .
If the first argument is False , then the second will be matched against True and or False x is strict in x .
Note that while wildcards are a general sign of non-strictness , this depends on their position with respect to the pattern matches against constructors .
Exercises Give an equivalent discussion for the logical and Can the logical " excluded or " ( xor ) be non -strict in one of its arguments if we know the other ?
There is another form of pattern matching , namely irrefutable patterns marked with a tilde ~ .
Their use is demonstrated by
f ~( Just x ) = 1 f Nothing = 2
An irrefutable pattern always succeeds ( hence the name ) resulting in f ⊥ = 1 .
But when changing the definition of f to
f ~( Just x ) = x + 1 f Nothing = 2 -- this line may as well be left away
we have
f ⊥ = ⊥ + 1 = ⊥ f ( Just 1 ) = 1 + 1 = 2
If the argument matches the pattern , x will be bound to the corresponding value .
Otherwise , any variable like x will be bound to ⊥ .
By default , let and where bindings are non-strict , too :
foo key map = let Just x = lookup key map in ...
is equivalent to
foo key map = case ( lookup key map ) of ~( Just x ) -> ...
Exercises
The Haskell language definition gives the detailed semantics of pattern matching and you should now be able to understand it .
So go on and have a look !
Consider a function or of two Bool ean arguments with the following properties : or ⊥ ⊥ = ⊥ or True ⊥ = True or ⊥
True =
True or False y = y or x False = x
This function is another example of joint strictness , but a much sharper one : the result is only ⊥ if both arguments are ( at least when we restrict the arguments to True and ⊥ ) .
Can such a function be implemented in Haskell ?
Recursive Data Types and Infinite Lists [ edit ]
The case of recursive data structures is not very different from the base case .
Consider a list of unit values
data List = [ ] | ( ) : List
Though this seems like a simple type , there is a surprisingly complicated number of ways you can fit ⊥ {\displaystyle \bot } in here and there , and therefore the corresponding graph is complicated .
The bottom of this graph is shown below .
An ellipsis indicates that the graph continues along this direction .
A red ellipse behind an element indicates that this is the end of a chain ; the element is in normal form .
and so on .
But now , there are also chains of infinite length like
⊥ ⊑ {\displaystyle \sqsubseteq } ⊑ {\displaystyle \sqsubseteq } ⊑ {\displaystyle \sqsubseteq }
This causes us some trouble as we noted in section Convergence that every monotone sequence must have a least upper bound .
This is only possible if we allow for infinite lists .
Infinite lists ( sometimes also called streams ) turn out to be very useful and their manifold use cases are treated in full detail in chapter Laziness .
Here , we will show what their denotational semantics should be and how to reason about them .
Note that while the following discussion is restricted to lists only , it easily generalizes to arbitrary recursive data structures like trees .
In the following , we will switch back to the standard list type
data [ a ] = [ ] | a : [ a ]
to close the syntactic gap to practical programming with infinite lists in Haskell .
Exercises Draw the non-flat domain corresponding [ Bool ] .
How is the graphic to be changed for [ Integer ] ?
Calculating with infinite lists is best shown by example .
For that , we need an infinite list
ones :: [ Integer ] ones = 1 : ones
When applying the fixed point iteration to this recursive definition , we see that ones ought to be the supremum of
⊥ ⊑ {\displaystyle \sqsubseteq } ⊑ {\displaystyle \sqsubseteq } ⊑ {\displaystyle \sqsubseteq } ⊑ {\displaystyle \sqsubseteq } ,
that is an infinite list of 1 .
Let 's try to understand what take 2 ones should be .
With the definition of take
take 0 _ = [ ] take n ( x : xs ) = x : take ( n - 1 ) xs take n [ ] = [ ]
we can apply take to elements of the approximating sequence of ones :
take 2 ⊥ == > ⊥ take 2 ( 1:⊥ ) ==> 1 : take 1 ⊥ == > 1 : ⊥ take 2 ( 1:1: ⊥ ) ==> 1 : take 1 ( 1:⊥ ) ==> 1 : 1 : take 0 ⊥ ==> 1 : 1 : [ ]
We see that take 2 ( 1:1:1 : ⊥ ) and so on must be the same as take 2 ( 1:1: ⊥ ) = 1:1 : [ ] because 1:1 : [ ] is fully defined .
Taking the supremum on both the sequence of input lists and the resulting sequence of output lists , we can conclude
take 2 ones = 1:1 : [ ]
Thus , taking the first two elements of ones behaves exactly as expected .
Generalizing from the example , we see that reasoning about infinite lists involves considering the approximating sequence and passing to the supremum , the truly infinite list .
Still , we did not give it a firm ground .
The solution is to identify the infinite list with the whole chain itself and to formally add it as a new element to our domain : the infinite list is the sequence of its approximations .
Of course , any infinite list like ones can be compactly depicted as
ones = 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 : ...
what simply means that
ones = ( ⊥ ⊑ {\displaystyle \sqsubseteq } ⊑ {\displaystyle \sqsubseteq } ⊑ {\displaystyle \sqsubseteq }
Exercises
Of course , there are more interesting infinite lists than ones .
Can you write recursive definition in Haskell for the natural numbers nats = 1:2:3:4 :... a cycle like cycle123 = 1:2:3 : 1:2:3 : ...
Look at the Prelude functions repeat and iterate and try to solve the previous exercise with their help .
Use the example from the text to find the value the expression drop 3 nats denotes .
Assume that the work in a strict setting , i.e. that the domain of [ Integer ] is flat .
What does the domain look like ?
What about infinite lists ?
What value does ones denote ?
What about the puzzle of how a computer can calculate with infinite lists ?
It takes an infinite amount of time , after all ?
Well , this is true .
But the trick is that the computer may well finish in a finite amount of time if it only considers a finite part of the infinite list .
So , infinite lists should be thought of as potentially infinite lists .
In general , intermediate results take the form of infinite lists whereas the final value is finite .
It is one of the benefits of denotational semantics that one can treat the intermediate infinite data structures as truly infinite when reasoning about program correctness .
Exercises
To demonstrate the use of infinite lists as intermediate results , show that take 3 ( map ( +1 ) nats ) = take 3 ( tail nats ) by first calculating the infinite sequence corresponding to map ( +1 ) nats .
Of course , we should give an example where the final result indeed takes an infinite time .
So , what does filter (< 5 ) nats denote ?
Sometimes , one can replace filter with takeWhile in the previous exercise .
Why only sometimes and what happens if one does ?
As a last note , the construction of a recursive domain can be done by a fixed point iteration similar to recursive definition for functions .
Yet , the problem of infinite chains has to be tackled explicitly .
See the literature in External Links for a formal construction .
Haskell specialities : Strictness Annotations and Newtypes [ edit ]
Haskell offers a way to change the default non-strict behavior of data type constructors by strictness annotations .
In a data declaration like
data Maybe ' a = Just ' !a | Nothing '
an exclamation point !
before an argument of the constructor specifies that it should be strict in this argument .
Hence we have Just ' ⊥ = ⊥ in our example .
Further information may be found in chapter Strictness .
In some cases , one wants to rename a data type , like in
data Couldbe a = Couldbe ( Maybe a )
However , Couldbe a contains both the elements ⊥ and Couldbe ⊥ .
With the help of a newtype definition
newtype Couldbe a = Couldbe ( Maybe a )
we can arrange that Couldbe a is semantically equal to Maybe a , but different during type checking .
In particular , the constructor Couldbe is strict .
Yet , this definition is subtly different from
data Couldbe ' a = Couldbe ' !( Maybe a )
To explain how , consider the functions
f ( Couldbe m ) = 42 f ' ( Couldbe ' m ) = 42
Here , f ' ⊥ will cause the pattern match on the constructor Couldbe ' to fail with the effect that f ' ⊥ = ⊥ .
But for the newtype , the match on Couldbe will never fail , we get f ⊥ = 42 .
In a sense , the difference can be stated as :
for the strict case , Couldbe ' ⊥ is a synonym for ⊥
is a synonym for ⊥ for the newtype , ⊥ is a synonym for Couldbe ⊥
with the agreement that a pattern match on ⊥ fails and that a match on Constructor ⊥ does not .
Newtypes may also be used to define recursive types .
An example is the alternate definition of the list type [ a ]
newtype List a =
In ( Maybe ( a , List a ) )
Again , the point is that the constructor
In does not introduce an additional lifting with ⊥ .
Here are a few more examples to differentiate between newtype and non-strict and strict data declarations ( in the interactive prompt ) :
Prelude > data D = D Int Prelude > data SD = SD ! Int Prelude > newtype NT = NT Int Prelude > ( \ ( D _ ) -> 42 ) ( D undefined ) 42 Prelude > ( \( SD _ ) -> 42 ) ( SD undefined ) *** Exception : Prelude.undefined [...]
Prelude > ( \( NT _ ) -> 42 ) ( NT undefined ) 42 Prelude > ( \ ( D _ ) -> 42 ) undefined *** Exception : Prelude.undefined [...]
Prelude > ( \( SD _ ) -> 42 ) undefined *** Exception : Prelude.undefined [...]
Prelude > ( \( NT _ ) -> 42 ) undefined 42

Abstract Interpretation and Strictness Analysis [ edit ]
As lazy evaluation means a constant computational overhead , a Haskell compiler may want to discover where inherent non-strictness is not needed at all which allows it to drop the overhead at these particular places .
To that extent , the compiler performs strictness analysis just like we proved in some functions to be strict section Strict Functions .
Of course , details of strictness depending on the exact values of arguments like in our example cond are out of scope ( this is in general undecidable ) .
But the compiler may try to find approximate strictness information and this works in many common cases like power2 .
Now , abstract interpretation is a formidable idea to reason about strictness : ...

Interpretation as Powersets [ edit ]
So far , we have introduced ⊥ and the semantic approximation order ⊑ {\displaystyle \sqsubseteq } abstractly by specifying their properties .
However , both as well as any inhabitants of a data type like Just ⊥ can be interpreted as ordinary sets .
This is called the powerset construction .
NOTE : i'm not sure whether this is really true .
Someone how knows , please correct this .
[ edit ]
Possible correction to my correction below , your notation for bottom is n't a powerset , its just a set which led to my correction .
Having read more , I have to retract the correction but I suspect `undefined = { {} , {( ) } }` in the first example and I 'm not sure that has any meaning in terms of Haskell notation so I guess it would be correct to call it ⊥ Original correction :
This is n't true , consider ( ) which would lead to undefined = ( ) which is n't true in Haskell : {( ) } \ \ ⊥ = {( ) }
Furthermore : { Just True} { Just False} \ / \ / { Nothing} { Just True , Just False} \ / \ / ⊥ = { Nothing , Just True , Just False} excludes
Just ⊥ but perhaps we'd be benefited if we could say data powerset Writer a b = Writer a b and get : ∀x y. Writer x y / \ / \ ∀x. Writer x ⊥ ∀y .
Writer ⊥ y \ / \ / Writer ⊥ ⊥ where undefined = Writer ⊥ ⊥ as the least defined occupant .
The idea is to think of ⊥ as the set of all possible values and that a computation retrieves more information this by choosing a subset .
In a sense , the denotation of a value starts its life as the set of all values which will be reduced by computations until there remains a set with a single element only .
As an example , consider Bool where the domain looks like
{ True} { False} \ / \ / ⊥ = { True , False}
The values True and False are encoded as the singleton sets { True} and { False} and ⊥ is the set of all possible values .
Another example is Maybe Bool :
{ Just True} { Just False} \ / \ / { Nothing} { Just True , Just False} \ / \ / ⊥ = { Nothing , Just True , Just False}
We see that the semantic approximation order is equivalent to set inclusion , but with arguments switched :
x ⊑ y ⟺ x ⊇ y {\displaystyle x\sqsubseteq y\iff x\supseteq y}
This approach can be used to give a semantics to exceptions in Haskell [ 6 ] .
Naïve Sets are unsuited for Recursive Data Types [ edit ]
In the section What to choose as Semantic Domain ? , we argued that taking simple sets as denotation for types does n't work well with partial functions .
In the light of recursive data types , things become even worse as John C. Reynolds showed in his paper Polymorphism is not set - theoretic [ 7 ] .
Reynolds actually considers the recursive type
newtype U = In ( ( U -> Bool ) -> Bool )
Interpreting Bool as the set { True , False} and the function type A ->
B as the set of functions from A to B , the type U can not denote a set .
This is because ( A -> Bool ) is the set of subsets ( powerset ) of A which , due to a diagonal argument analogous to Cantor 's argument that there are " more " real numbers than natural ones , always has a bigger cardinality than A .
Thus , ( U -> Bool ) ->
Bool has an even bigger cardinality than U and there is no way for it to be isomorphic to U .
Hence , the set U must not exist , a contradiction .
In our world of partial functions , this argument fails .
Here , an element of U is given by a sequence of approximations taken from the sequence of domains
⊥ , ( ⊥ -> Bool ) ->
Bool , ( (( ⊥ -> Bool ) -> Bool ) -> Bool ) ->
Bool and so on
where ⊥ denotes the domain with the single inhabitant ⊥.
While the author of this text admittedly has no clue on what such a thing should mean , the constructor gives a perfectly well defined object for U .
We see that the type ( U -> Bool ) ->
Bool merely consists of shifted approximating sequences which means that it is isomorphic to U .
As a last note , Reynolds actually constructs an equivalent of U in the second order polymorphic lambda calculus .
There , it happens that all terms have a normal form , i.e. there are only total functions when we do not include a primitive recursion operator fix :: ( a -> a ) -> a .
Thus , there is no true need for partial functions and ⊥ , yet a naïve set theoretic semantics fails .
We can only speculate that this has to do with the fact that not every mathematical function is computable .
In particular , the set of computable functions Nat ->
Bool should not have a bigger cardinality than Nat .

Online books about Denotational Semantics
" Building Block " Hypothesis :
A GA works by combining short , low - order ,
highly fit schemata ( “ building blocks ” ) into
fitter higher order schemata .
- But how would we recognise one if we saw one ?
- Building what ?
- How many of them are there ?
- Just how are they combined together ?
- When is recombination beneficial ?
- How does the effect of recombination depend on the fitness landscape ( and on other operators / parameters ) ?
I found a Power Point presentation ( named ) , by Chris Stephens , upon some critiques related to Building Block Hypothesis and , also , on the Building Blocks itself .
That presentation was held at FOGA 2007 .
I paid attention to four slides , I guess they speak by themselves .
It 's so intelligent and funny ! :)
Stephens made interesting question on the Building Block Hypothesis , see below : The good old Building Block Hypothesis !
I remember that , once , at a evolutionary computation class , I asked the professor how someone could guarantee that the unknown solution of a problem could be achieved through short , low order , above average schemata , if the solution itself is unknown ?!
What if the solution is neither short nor has low order ?
Could a genetic algorithm get the optimumworking through strings with below average fitnesses ?
The professor was so categoric and said that the Building Block Hypothesis really explains the way genetic algorithms work .
Well , when the problem has to do with decomposable / separable fitness functions , it should work fine , however put some dependencies among variables and you will see what happens - even for EDAs the dependencies can represent a frightening nightmare , since , when dealing with strong dependencies , the probability distribution that samples the strings can be almost computationally unfeasible to calculate .
NEW EPISODE All On The Line Tuesdays 8ET
The Joys of Menial Labor
We have a new column in this week ’s New York Times Magazine , which is a special issue on the boomer generation .
Our piece is called “ Laid - Back Labor , ” and it actually germinated from a blog post here a few months ago .
Here ’s one paragraph from the column :
Is n’t it puzzling that so many middle - aged Americans are spending so much of their time and money performing menial labors when they do n’t have to ?
Just as the radio and phonograph proved to be powerful substitutes for the piano , the forces of technology and capitalism have greatly eased the burden of feeding and clothing ourselves .
So what ’s with all the knitting , gardening and [ as the U.S. Census Bureau calls it ] “ cooking for fun ” ?
Why do some forms of menial labor survive as hobbies while others have been killed off ?
( For instance , we ca n’t think of a single person who , since the invention of the washing machine , practices “ laundry for fun . ” )
As always , we ’ve posted some related research material elsewhere on this site .
Comments welcome below .
Jena , about 220 miles north of New Orleans , is a small town of 3,000 people , 85 per cent of whom are white .
Tomorrow it will be the focus for a race trial which could put it on the map alongside the bad old names of the Mississippi Burning Sixties such as Selma or Montgomery , Alabama .
Jena is gaining national notoriety as an example of the new ' stealth ' racism , showing how lightly sleep the demons of racial prejudice in America 's Deep South , even in the year that a black man , Barak Obama , is a serious candidate for the White House .
It began in Jena 's high school last August when Kenneth Purvis asked the headteacher if black students could break with a long - held tradition and join the whites who sit under the tree in the school courtyard during breaks .
The boy was told that he and his friends could sit where they liked .
The following morning white students had hung three nooses there .
' Bad taste , silly , but just a prank , ' was the response of most of Jena 's whites .
' To us those nooses meant the KKK [ Ku Klux Klan ] , they meant , " Niggers , we 're going to kill you , we 're going to hang you till you die , " ' says Caseptla Bailey , a black community leader and mother of one of the accused .
The three white perpetrators of what was seen as a race hate crime were given ' in - school ' suspensions ( sent to another school for a few days before returning ) .
Jena 's major industry is growing and marketing junk pine .
Walk down the usually deserted main street and you will not find many black employees .
Bailey , 56 , is a former air force officer and holder of a business management degree .
' I could n't even get a job in Jena as a bank teller , ' she said .
' Look at the banks and the best white - collar jobs and you 'll see only white and red necks in those collars . '
Billy Doughty , the local barber , has never cut black men's hair .
' They just do n't come here , ' he mumbled .
' Anyway , their hair is different and difficult to cut . '
The majority of blacks live in an area known as Ward 10 .
Many homes are trailers , or wooden shacks .
Rubbish lies in the streets .
On ' Snob Hill ' , where the whites live , the spacious gardens and lawns are trimmed , the gravelled drives boast SUVs and nice new saloons .
Only two black families live there .
A teacher from Jena High had enough money to buy his way in .
But when he arrived local estate agents refused to show him a ' white ' property even though several were advertised in the local paper ( ' they 're all under contract , ' the agents lied ) .
The teacher eventually went to see one white owner and offered him cash .
' The guy preferred green [ dollars ] to black , so I got the property , ' laughed the teacher , ' but since we moved in three years ago we have n't been invited by a single neighbour . '
On 30 November , someone tried to burn Jena High to the ground .
The crime remains unsolved .
That same weekend race fights between teenagers broke out downtown , and on 4 December racial tension boiled over once more in the school .
A white student , Justin Barker , was attacked , allegedly by six black students .
The expected charges of assault and battery were not laid , and the six were charged with attempted second - degree murder and conspiracy to commit second - degree murder .
They now face a lifetime in jail .
Barker spent the evening of the assault at the local Baptist church , where he was seen by friends to be ' his usual smiling self ' .
Nine days later , with the case technically sub judice , the District Attorney made the following public statement to the local paper : ' I will not tolerate this type of behaviour .
To those who act in this manner I tell you that you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and with the harshest crimes that the facts justify .
When you are convicted I will seek the maximum penalty allowed by law .
I will see to it that you never again menace the students at any school in this parish . '
Bail for the impoverished students was set absurdly high , and most have been held in custody .
The town 's mind seems to be made up .
But now the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the American Civil Liberties Union - ' damned outsiders ' - have become involved and have begun to recruit , enthuse and empower the local black population .
Reporters from the BBC and the New York Times have been drawn to the story .
Jena does not like this publicity and shifts uncomfortably in the glare .
It is 42 years since President Lyndon Johnson closed the loopholes that allowed southern states to discriminate against blacks .
When the accused shuffle into court tomorrow , it 's Jena that will be on trial .

The Million Dollar Homepage was unavailable for an extended period early today , as huge publicity accompanied the completion of Alex Tew 's novel online advertising service .
Tew , a 21 - year - old UK college student , sold the final 1,000 pixels for $ 38,100 in an eBay auction that closed Wednesday , netting Tew a total of $ 1,037,100 in total ad sales .
The winner of the auction has not yet been announced .
Tew launched the site in September to pay his college expenses , offering 1 million pixels of ad space at $ 1 a pixel .
The gimmick has paid off in huge web traffic .
Milliondollarhomepage.com has received up to 500,000 unique visitors per day , and uses up to 200 megabits per second of Internet bandwidth , according to its host , Sitelutions .
The Million Dollar Homepage is scheduled to remain online for five years , and appears to now be back online after several hours of downtime , which can be seen in this performance chart :
A dynamically updating performance chart is available for milliondollarhomepage.com .
Netcraft offers a web site performance monitoring service that provides similar charts , along with e-mail alerts when an outage occurs .
Sitelutions is operated by InfoRelay Online Systems , an Englishtown , N.J. hosting company , which Tew has praised for its performance .
" They have given me an unbelievable level of support and ensured that the site has stayed online despite the millions of visitors , " Tew wrote in his weblog .
Sitelutions offers a 99.999 % network uptime guarantee , and says it donates 10 percent of its profits to charities chosen by its users .
Milliondollarhomepage.com has been a boost to other web hosting companies as well .
Globat bought 5,100 pixels , linking them to a special promotion that the company said has been a big success .
" We gained tremendous exposure and also sent a message to young entrepreneurs worldwide that creativity and ingenuity will always capture the interest of progressive companies such as Globat , " said Ben Neumann , president and CEO of Globat . " In Alex I saw the purest form of entrepreneurship .
He set a high goal and succeeded . "
Tew 's success has sparked the launch of dozens of copycat " pixel advertising " sites , including several that bought advertising on milliondollarhomepage.com .
I have not been a big fan of comic book movies .
Other than Spider - Man and Batman , there has n’t been too much to brag about .
Even the X - Men movies — which I enjoyed — left a lot to be desired .
Frank Miller ’s 300 , on the other hand , is every thing it should be .
CGI
Sin City
Yes , I am saying decapitations and gallons of blood are beautiful .
Live action andhave finally reached perfection .
Panel by panel , blood splat by blood splat , this movie creates a perfect mirror of Miller ’s graphic novel .
It is all thatwas not .
The cinematography and special effects are eyegasmiclybeautiful .
negative
Here are a couplereviews that describe everything I love about the movie :
book version of Gladiator with Frank Miller art direction . ”
300
, even with its impressive vistas of computer - generated soldiers , is just a throwaway epic .
Excuse me , but that ’s the point .
This is not a historically accurate geopolitical epic .
It is a just a good old fashioned get your money 's worth of a roller coaster .
Perhaps a mention in the opening credits of its graphic novel origins would have helped .
At least the Marvel Movies start with the Marvel logo and flashing comic pages .
Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times understands perfectly what 300 is trying to accomplish and reviewed it accordingly :
“ If you thought " Gladiator " was a bit too stingy with the bloodshed , if you felt " Sin City " could have been more stylized , if you hate it when the masses refer to graphic novels as " comic books , " this is your day . ”
So if you love Frank Miller stuff , see this movie .
If you love a good ass - kicking movie , see this movie .
If you want that , " I need to run up the steps of Philadelphia 's Museum of Art because I just saw Rocky II feeling , " see this movie .
One word of warning , you might not want to take your girlfriends and wives with you .
It is definitely not a “ date movie . ”
You will have to watch 3 or 4 Sandra Bullock movies to make up for it .
And who wants to do that ?

Cleveland Democratic Congressman Dennis Kucinich , who is drafting legislation to ban civilian ownership of handguns , kept a pistol in his house after police learned of a Mafia plot to kill him during his tumultous stint as Cleveland 's mayor during the 1970s .
Now seeking the presidency , Kucinich was among five Democratic candidates who admitted during a Thursday night presidential debate that they 'd kept guns in their houses during their adulthoods .
The other gun-toting Democrats were former Alaska Sen . Mike Gravel , Delaware Sen. Joe Biden , Connecticut Sen. Christopher Dodd and New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson .
" Shotgun , not pistol , " Biden volunteered during the MSNBC - sponsored debate in Orangeburg , South Carolina .
Kucinich spokesman Andy Juniewicz said the congressman kept a pistol at home long ago , after police learned that a Mafia hitman had planned to shoot Kucinich as he marched in an October 1978 parade .
Kucinich ended up missing the parade because he was hospitalized with an ulcer , but police feared subsequent murder attempts so they recommended that he keep a gun in the house , Juniewicz said .
Details of that plot were publicized during a 1984 Senate inquiry into organized crime activities .
News accounts at that time suggested that Cleveland organized crime figures were frustrated that some of Kucinich 's mayoral initiatives were thwarting their money - making plans .
Earlier in his career , Kucinich owned a starter 's pistol that he kept to scare potential muggers , said his congressional spokeswoman , Natalie Laber .
He no longer owns either weapon .
" From the time he first ran for city council , he has supported controls on handguns , " Laber said .
After this month 's massacre at Virginia Tech , Kucinich announced plans to draft legislation that would ban the purchase , sale , transfer , or possession of handguns by civilians .
A gun buy - back provision will be included in the bill .
The easy availability of handguns is " a growing national crisis of public health and safety , one that calls for a powerful , wide - ranging response from Congress , " Kucinich said last week .
Right - wing pundits in Internet ratings freefall RAW STORY
Published : Friday June 30 , 2006 Print This | Email This Many well - known right - wing media figures -- including Rush Limbaugh , Ann Coulter and Bill O'Reilly -- are losing their Internet audiences , according to an analysis of Web site ratings by IPD Group and U.S. Politics Today .
On the other hand , traffic for Moveon.org has risen .
On Thursday , Shakespeare 's Sister checked other sites from the right and left at the same tracking service , Alexa.com , used in the analysis .
According to the blogger , Free Republic , Hugh Hewitt , World Net Daily , and Pajamas Media have all suffered at least a 19 percent decline , while the traffic at Raw Story , Crooks and Liars , and Think Progress has risen .
A release issued by IPD Group reads : #
An odd thing seems to have happened to mighty right - wing talking head media juggernaut .
They are still talking , but fewer people seem to be listening -- at least on the Internet .
Alexa.com , which is owned and operated by Amazon.com , tracks online usage for all Web sites , large and small .
At Alexa.com , you can check a site 's activity up to the minute , or follow its trail back for many years .
At U.S. Politics Today , we thought it might be interesting to see how the right - wing media machine was doing .
Not well , it turns out .
During the past three months , for instance , Rush Limbaugh 's , traffic ranking has declined 18 percent .
He still huffs and puffs away daily on radio , but advertisers might want to double check the size of his audience .
If the bottom has dropped out on him online , it likely has had a similar trend line with his radio show .
Even Fox News , that gold standard of right - wing media , is down 13 percent .
Here are the numbers .
Ann Coulter is coining money by attacking widows and orphans -- a new game for her since she 's run out of Democrats , living and dead , to defame and verbally pillage .
You would think with all of the attention the promotion of her new book has given her would raise visitor numbers at her Web site .
Nope .
Traffic there is down 10 percent .
The audience chart reversal seems to be common across the entire right - wing side of the Internet viewing board .
Billoreilly.com has dropped 40 percent in the past three months .
Townhall.com , that once popular center for right - wing news and commentary , has fallen by 24 percent .
The Washington Times Web site is down by 27 percent .
And Matt Drudge , once the hottest right - wing name in Internet sites ?
Alexa.com says DrudgeReport.com is down 21 percent .
Could it be that Internet users are getting tired of political sites in general ?
Maybe so .
But MoveOn.org is up 13 percent in the same period .
President Bush 's fall from grace has been well documented by poll - after - poll .
The unpopularity of Congress may not be at historic lows , but those 20 - something level of support numbers can't be comforting to those who manage things on Capitol Hill .
It seems logical that with enthusiasm draining from the right - wing movement that put the president and the current Congress in place , the media chorus that has lavished praise on them all these many years would be affected by the change in fortune .
And so it seems , looking at the Alexa.com numbers -- if they are to be believed .
Those graph lines may not directly parallel the decline in GOP poll numbers , but they are all heading in the same direction -- down .
This week I ’m in West Virginia teaching creativity for the Federal Government .
I ’ve been hired to teach as part of a Leadership Development program for people from all departments and levels of government .
This program is a week - long retreat that happens here six times a year , and it ’s a pretty remarkable thing to be doing .
( I ’ll pause to allow you a moment to ask the same question everyone else has asked .
“ THIS administration ?
Hired YOU ? ” )
As a matter of fact , it did .
When I teach creativity , I have to shift gears .
It ’s like I have to step out of this camp that I ’m usually in , so that I can walk to the outside borders , and look in and view it from there .
That ’s the best way to describe what it feels like to move out of creating mode and into teaching about creating mode .
It ’s daunting to try and name something that ca n’t be named .
Creativity , in so many ways , ca n’t be named .
And yet , it must be given names and pointers so that people do n’t think that the little creativity camp is exclusive , and give up on ever find their way in .
Providing pointers and road signs helps people navigate better so they can get there on their own if they choose .
So , that ’s what I do .
I walk on a tiny little thin line when I teach .
I think it ’s the thin line in between the right and left brain .
In the spirit of this week , here are 17 Very Scattered and Random Celebratory Things I Know for Sure about Creativity .
1 – Creativity cures .
I ca n’t explain how or why .
I have this sense that our left - brain world , while productive and efficient , has made us jumpy , panicky , and sad .
Our addictions and miseries stem partly from allowing no time for play , no time for witnessing beauty , or for creating it .
I have known countless people ( including me ) who , when they started scheduling regular creative time in their lives , began to heal all kinds of messes and addictions .
2 – Creativity is about paying attention .
So is meditation .
So is enlightenment .
When I teach songwriting , I assign daily scheduled writing time .
Students always ask , “ What do you DO when you write ? ” I pay attention .
I play the guitar .
I moodle .
I spend time with the song I ’m writing .
Sometimes I have four songs going at once .
I spend time with each one of them as if they were children .
When I pay attention long enough , the song always begins to take shape .
But if I ’m pushing or demanding , it does n’t budge .
All areas of art have their own version of paying attention .
But no matter what you ’re creating , paying attention is a requirement .
( Are n’t the best meals you create the ones where you ’re simply happy to be preparing the food ? )
3 – Creativity is not sane .
I got a comment recently on my last post on creativity .
The angry commenter wrote , “ I think your ideas are insane . ”
Good !
Creativity is the one place where you get to let go of rationality and sanity .
4 – The only way to learn about creativity is to create things .
That ’s the bad news .
I can go on and on here .
You can buy twelve more books on how to be more creative .
But all you ’re doing is putting it off , asking for more time .
“ Just Do It ” is actually quite the wise advertising slogan .
When I wrote my first real song ( Pocketful of Pennies , on my first CD ) I got my first ah - ha glimpses about songwriting and songs .
I got that creating things is not linear , which brings me to the next thing I know .
5 – Creativity is squiggle-y .
Songs are linear .
Stories are linear .
Blogs are linear .
You ’d think that you ’d create them linearly .
But when you ’re creating things , nothing is linear .
Everything squiggles .
You do n’t start at Point A and go to Point C , via Point B. Creating a song might go like this :
You get an idea .
You sit with the idea .
Another idea comes about how to begin .
You start there because you have to start somewhere .
Then you end up writing a chorus that turns out to be the third verse .
A whole new chorus comes .
Then you get stumped .
Then you get one line that turns the whole idea around and shoots you off in the direction you were meant to go all along .
And it ’s easy for a while .
Then you get stumped again and re-write that third verse .
Eventually , a song that makes sense to the listener is born .
6 – Creativity is not an event .
It ’s not the prom .
It ’s the times you held hands under the bleachers during gym .
It ’s not a wedding .
It ’s the years after when you ’re laughing together as you ’re lying in bed at night .
It ’s not the Olympics .
It ’s the Saturday mornings you spend with your kid skating at the rink and smiling at how cute he looks charging along with such determination .
It ’s not Christmas Day .
It ’s all the twinkle lights and the smell of wood smoke and that one carol that reminds you of your grandma .
Creativity is the process and the unfolding .
It ’s not an event .
7 – Creative prolificity requires that your left - brain shut up .
( Mostly so that you can make up words like “ prolificity . ” )
Successful creativity has to do with tricking your nit - picky left - brain into going away for a while .
This is why having daily scheduled writing time or drawing time works so well .
After a few days of it , the left - brain gets really sick of this dumb inefficient use of time and eventually sits it out .
That ’s when things get good , and that ’s when you can really have fun .
One of my favorite pieces of advice from Julia Cameron is to say : “ Okay God , I ’ll take care of the quantity , YOU take care of the quality . ”
8 – Judgment transmogrifies into discernment when you ’re creative .
You ’d think that what I ’m describing here would make you so float -y that you ’d end up creating any old piece of crap that had no merit at all .
But over time , the left - brain critical side can join in , become less critical , and turn into a guide .
Rather than judging , it discerns .
If a song is n’t working , I know it .
And if I am paying attention to it and sitting with it , my critical mind becomes softer .
It says , “ Hmm . I wonder if you ’ve tried to use too many words in this line .
Maybe simplifying would make it funnier . ”
You ’ll eventually have to allow some place for that critical thinking part of you to come out .
Especially when you ’re editing .
And in deep creative spaces , that voice sounds less like judgment and more like discernment .
There ’s a big difference .
You learn how valuable that difference can be .
9 – Miserable people are rarely creative .
Complainers and cynics are n’t typically taking pottery classes and signing up to learn drawing .
They ’re too busy being pissed off to take action .
Creativity un - blocks stuck lives .
It ’s the side effect no one talks about .
I think it ’s because when you get to spend any significant time in the right hemisphere of your brain , a whole new world opens up to you .
10 – Everyone has valid fears , excuses , resentments , and blocks .
There are always reasons why you might : fail , suck , look stupid , make bad art , get laughed at , be called a fraud .
There are always reasons why you : do n’t have enough time , had a rotten childhood , got stopped in your tracks by a bad review , feel compelled to do everything for everyone else , feel guilty for taking the time .
There are always people : who will be mean , who will laugh , who wo n’t approve , who wo n’t show up , who will tell you that your ideas are insane .
Creativity teaches you to say , “ So - what ? ”
11 – Blogging is creative .
I think blogs have become so popular because bloggers get to just write .
They get to see the big deal of not making it such a big deal .
In addition to all the marketing and business blah - blah - blah that surrounds blogging , it is teaching all types to just create things .
12 – You do n’t have to get stoned to shut the critic up .
You just have to keep showing up .
In fact , I ’ll bet your art gets better when you ’re not stoned .
13 – If I am grouchy , angry , tense , or anxiety ridden , it usually means it has been too long since I sat with my guitar .
So , if you ’re feeling any of those things , or if you ’re a blogger , and you ’re feeling awful about how you have n’t written a post in three weeks , then just go sit down and write something .
Say Julia Cameron ’s prayer .
I am always amazed at how a morning of writing will lead me to this next point …
14 – When you ’re creating something , you really GET that all of the things that are supposed to matter so much do n’t matter much at all .
They do n’t .
We just let all these meaningless things occupy our minds because that ’s what our left - brains like to do .
They like to solve problems .
And when they do n’t have problems to solve , well , then they like to create them .
15 – Creativity is all at once this gigantic mystery and this no - big - deal simple joy .
It ’s like those Magic Eye books .
For the longest time I watched people staring at those stupid pictures and then exclaiming , “ WHOOOOOAAAA !’
And I could n’t figure it out .
I got angry and it seemed so unfair .
Then one day , kind of simply and slowly , my eyes made that necessary shift and I was IN .
When you ’re in , you can move your eyes all over the place and look around and it ’s no big deal , but at the same time it ’s really mysterious and wild , too !
That is exactly how creativity feels to me .
16 – Creativity is better than therapy .
See # 14
17 – Creativity is about showing up , not perfection .
If you want to be more creative in your life , if you crave a more artful life , start small .
Make cards for people .
Make ugly cards .
Call them “ Ugly Cards , Inc . ” Write bad poems .
Call them “ Bad Poems , Inc . ”
I bought a thank you gift for a friend of mine recently .
And it sat on my desk for weeks because I was waiting to find “ the perfect card . ”
Knowing what I know about Energy Drains and Creativity , I finally got so frustrated with myself and my perfectionist that I just ripped a piece of paper off a Kinko ’s notepad .
I folded it .
On the front of the “ card , ” I wrote : “ Beautifully crafted card with the perfect sentiment expressing exactly how grateful I am for your presence in my life . ”
And I opened the “ card , ” and on the inside I wrote : “ with the perfect little punch - line inside to make you laugh and feel good about yourself . ”
And I sent the card and package .
And it brought my friend great joy .
She loved the card .
Stop trying to be perfect .
Just show up .
It will unfold to reveal a hundred perfect little punch - lines .
If Crack Dealers Took Lessons From Walgreens , They Really Would Be Rich
Several weeks ago , I was talking to a physician in Houston , the sort of older gentleman family doctor you do n’t see much of anymore .
His name is Cyril Wolf .
He ’s originally from South Africa , but other than that , he struck me as the quintessential American general practitioner of decades past .
I ’d asked him a variety of questions — what ’s changed in recent years in his practice , how managed care has affected him , etc. — when suddenly his eyes fired up , his jaw set tight , and his voice took on a tone of great exasperation .
He began to describe a simple but huge problem in his practice : a lot of generic medications are still too expensive for his patients to afford .
Many of his patients , he explained , must pay for their drugs out - of - pocket , and yet even the generic drugs at pharmacy chains like Walgreens , Eckerd , and CVS could cost them dearly .
So Wolf began snooping around and found that two chains , Costco and Sam ’s Club , sold generics at prices far , far below the other chains .
Even once you factor in the cost of buying a membership at Costco and Sam ’s Club , the price differences were astounding .
Here are the prices he found at Houston stores for 90 tablets of generic Prozac :
Walgreens : $ 117
Eckerd : $ 115
CVS : $ 115
Sam ’s Club : $ 15
Costco : $ 12
Those are n’t typos .
Walgreens charges $ 117 for a bottle of the same pills for which Costco charges $ 12 .
I was skeptical at first .
Why on earth , I asked Wolf , would anyone in his right mind fill his generic prescription at Walgreen ’s instead of Costco ?
His answer : if a retiree is used to filling his prescriptions at Walgreens , that ’s where he fills his prescriptions — and he assumes that the price of a generic drug ( or , perhaps , any drug ) is pretty much the same at any pharmacy .
Talk about information asymmetry ; talk about price discrimination .
I had meant to blog about this , and had collected a few relevant links : a TV news report in Houston about Wolf ’s discovery ; an extensive price comparison compiled by a TV news reporter in Detroit ; a Consumer Reports survey ; and a research report on the subject from Senator Dianne Feinstein .
But I had forgotten all about this issue until reading this comprehensive article in yesterday ’s Wall Street Journal , which does a good job of measuring the difference in prices between chains ( most of the differences are n’t as drastic as Wolf ’s example with prescription Prozac , but they are still huge ) as well as the economics behind the pricing of prescription drugs in general .
Perhaps the most interesting sentence in the article is this one :
After a call from a reporter , CVS said it would drop its simvastatin price [ from $ 108.99 ] to $ 79.99 , as part of an “ ongoing price analysis . ”
So that ’s what they call it : “ ongoing price analysis . ”
I ’ll have to remember that the next time my kids catch me trying to buy a $ 2 toy when I ’d promised one for $ 20 .
It 's Kucinich , Gravel , and Biden in controversial Fox and Black Caucus - sponsored debate Michael Roston
Published : Tuesday May 29 , 2007 Print This Email This
With the leading candidates for the Democratic nomination in 2008 shunning a presidential primary debate sponsored by Fox News and a thinktank associated with the Congressional Black Caucus , Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) , Senator Joseph Biden ( D - DE ) , and former Alaska Senator Mike Gravel have announced their readiness to stand in a controversial spotlight .
" He 's ready to debate the issues anywhere at any time , and reach out to a new constituency , " said Alex Colvin , a spokesman for former Alaska Senator Mike Gravel .
" Senator Gravel looks forward to any opportunity to discuss the issues with other Democratic candidates . "
Rep. Kucinich , known primarily for his push to impeach Vice President Dick Cheney and his strong anti-war position , criticized his opponents who were unwilling to show up to the CBC / Fox debate .
" Fox broadcasts the World Series , too , but is it any less of a World Series because it's on Fox ?
Ask the fans in St. Louis , or Anaheim , or Boston , " the Ohio Democrat said in a statement released by his campaign .
" Lets face it , the race for the presidency is the World Series of politics , and here you have three candidates for President who are admitting that not only can they not hit right - handed pitching , they 're even afraid to step up to the plate and take a swing .
Well , I 'm one candidate for President who can hit any pitch anyone throws at me .
And I 'll be taking the field in Detroit this September with the Congressional Black Caucus . "
Senator Biden was a bit more muted than the competitors with whom he 'll be standing on stage , telling the New York Times through a spokesman on Sunday that " the caucus represented ' an important base ' and Fox offered an unparalleled forum for a candidate ' to hold the Bush administrations feet to the fire on their handling of Iraq . ' "
Senators Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and former Senator John Edwards have all refused to participate in the debate .
Senator Obama , who was rumored to have blackballed Fox News earlier in the year for broadcasting a disproven claim that he had been educated in an Islamic madrassa , said through a spokesman that " It just seems that CNN would be a more appropriate host . "
Senator Chris Dodd's ( D - CT ) office has not yet issued a comment on whether or not he would join in the debate .
Governor Bill Richardson of New Mexico at first told the Times he would not participate in the debate , but then said that the former Clinton administration Energy Secretary and Ambassador to the UN had not made a decision .
While the CBC 's cooperation with Fox News on presidential debates has been debated since the spring time , the debate itself is not scheduled until Sept. 23 , 2007 .
The CBC Institute will also sponsor a subsequent debate in Jan. 2008 with CNN .
This article is about high - level - optimization , i.e .
I will explain how I usually approach optimizing a program without going into the gory details .
There are a million books and web pages about low - level - optimizations and the tricks involved out there , therefore I will not dive into that ( could not possibly hope to cover this in a single blog - entry anyways ) .
Many of the points made here may sound like a matter of course , yet I have not obeyed them myself enough times in the past to know , that sometimes the temptation to just start changing stuff around in my programs is bigger than my rationality .
All of the points presented here can be found in any reasonably good book about optimization , but I know enough programmers that have never read any of them ( to be honest : I have not read too many of them either ) .
A little repetition of some obvious points will therefore not hurt .
Lets start by assuming I have a program that I think should run faster / consume less resources or become smaller , and I want to optimize the hell out of it .
My first advice to myself is usually :
Step away from the keyboard , Michael , and ask yourself , if an optimization step is really necessary ?
Are you solving a definite problem ?
Or do you just want to do it , because you can and want to prove yourself , what a hotshot programmer you are ?
Optimization does not come without costs , as it is usually harder to maintain an optimized program than an unoptimized one , as many optimizations sacrifice maintainability for e.g. speed .
I also need to spend some time doing the optimizations ( usually more than planned – quite often way more than planned ) , and my time is usually not free as well .
These are the costs to be payed , and I should only do so for a reason and not just because I can .
If I have convinced myself , that my program really needs optimizations , it ’s now time to start measuring ( despite my inner voice usually shouting something along the lines of : come on , Michael , just get started already ! ) .
Depending on what I want to optimize for , I might measure the memory footprint or the size of the program .
I will concentrate on the most usual case where I want to make my program run faster – in this case I will probably measure wall clock time .
Not everything I try will actually benefit the total execution time of the program ( e.g. because compilers know a lot of tricks these days and some of the changes I will try might cause one of these tricks to stop working – thereby slowing down the program ) .
Therefore it is necessary to have a solid starting point to compare with .
It is also important to have a way of verifying the correctness of my program .
I will not go into details here , but having tests will not hurt , as many optimizations will alter the semantics of the program .
Having a way to quickly revert changes to the program ( version control ) will also prove beneficial , but that is a topic for a different article alltogether .
Having done that , I am now ready for the real thing ( TM ) .
But where to start ?
Staying with our example of optimizing for speed ( which will persist to the end of this article ) , I usually start by unleashing the power of the compiler on the program .
Playing around with the compilers optimization options usually does not take long and does not hurt the maintainability of the program at all .
Therefore I usually try it first .
I have also successfully played around with profile guided optimization recently .
In most cases , this will yield only a couple percent speed increase , but I have witnessed greater ones as well and it is an easy thing to try .
After each optimization step , I need to make sure three things are taken care of :
I need to verify the correctness of the optimized program .
No one needs a lightning - fast program producing the wrong results .
And yes , some compiler optimizations will change the semantics of the program and may therefore produce wrong results .
If the program is still correct , I need to measure its performance ( in our example probably wall clock time ) and compare it to my previous performance measurement .
And yes , some compiler optimizations may make the program slower .
If the speed increased , I need to ask myself , if the programs performance now is sufficient .
If yes , stop optimizing ( even if it is hard , because you know of so many other things to try ) .
If no , try the next technique described below .
Now that the compilers had their fun with the program , it is almost time to get my hands dirty .
But before I can start making changes all over the place , I need to realize there is one critical piece of information I am still missing :
Where is my program spending all of its time ?
I used to think I know that just by looking at the program .
I am almost always wrong .
Most of the people I know are as well .
So before I spend my valuable time optimizing code that only contributes little to the total execution time , it is now time to utilize another tool out of my programmers toolbox : my trusted profiler ( you have one in there , too , do n’t you ? ) .
It will tell me exactly where the so called hotspots of my programs are and where my optimizations will really make a difference .
Most profilers work on a per-function - basis .
Therefore , I can already hear some people complaining :
Of course my code spends most of its time in ‘ big_function_foo ( ) ’ , all this profiling did not help me at all !
If you are one of these people complaining , I suggest thinking about the size of your functions a little more .
There are lots of rules of thumb among programmers regarding the maximum size of a function , e.g. not bigger than a screen or the minimum functionality that makes sense .
If you write your functions accordingly , you will have nice and meaningful profiler output as a side effect .
I wish I always obeyed these rules !
Of course , there are also profilers that work on a per-line basis .
I know from experience , not to take the line numbers it spits out too seriously ( because of program optimizations done by the compiler ) , but the information presented by these tools will allow me to at least isolate the regions of code that need optimizing , even if my functions are bigger than suggested in the above paragraph ( of course this never happens .
Never . Really ! 🙂 ) .
Now that I know , where to start optimizing , there is one last piece of high - level - advice I want to share .
Before starting to unroll loops or trying out any of the fancy low - level - techniques presented in the books about optimization , I once again take a step back and start thinking about algorithms and data structures for a while .
What complexity do the algorithms at my hotspots have ?
Is there maybe an alternative algorithm with less complexity ?
Or is it possible to change my data structures to avoid repeating calculations over and over again , therefore trading memory space for speed ?
In my experience , these and similar considerations have more potential to speed up programs than anything else .
Only after this potential has been thoroughly evaluated , low - level - optimizations should come into play .
Let ’s go through the three checks I mentioned earlier once again ( a little repetition wont hurt 😉 ) :
Is my program still correct ?
Is it faster than before ?
Is my program fast enough now for me to stop the optimization process ?
As mentioned above , these should be evaluated after every optimization step , including the ones sketched in the last paragraph .
This almost brings me to the end of this article .
All other techniques for optimization I would describe as having a lower level ( but if you disagree with me on this point , feel free to leave a comment ) .
There is one last technique , I would like to mention here : I could wait for six month and then buy a faster computer .
This has been a very important and successfull optimization in the past , as usually the processing speeds have increased a lot during that time .
But as I already mentioned in another article , these times may be over .
Herb Sutter describes it best in his article titled The Free Lunch Is Over : A Fundamental Turn Toward Concurrency in Software ( this is the last time I will link to this article , I promise 🙂 ) .
Unless your software has been parallelized already , you may not see any speed increases at all during the next few month ( years ? ) , except possibly due to increased cache sizes .
Which of course brings me back to my favorite topic of parallelization , which in itself is kind of like an optimization technique .
Unfortunately , not one I would consider high - level .
But this is a topic for another post …
Colbert bids a warm farewell to Paul Wolfowitz David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday May 22 , 2007 Print This Email This
In the following video clip from The Colbert Report , Stephen Colbert begins by speaking sympathetically of Paul Wolfowitz 's forced departure from the World Bank , saying " We can all relate to this situation .
...
My departure from The Daily Show was precipitated by my decision to get wasted and rub my bare butt on Jon Stewart 's desk . "
Colbert goes on to draw the conclusion that no Bush appointee ever steps down because of criticism , but only after being told what a wonderful job they 've done .
He suggests that anyone who would like to see the president impeached send the White House a letter saying that Bush " is the greatest president ever ...
He can bend spoons with his mind and his flesh tastes like apple pie . "

Tony Blair today made his strongest attack yet on the Iranian government , declaring that President Ahmadinejad 's government was a " major strategic threat " to the Middle East .
Despite calls from the James Baker - led Iraq Study Group for direct talks with Tehran and Damascus , Mr Blair said there was " little point " in including Iran and Syria in regional issues " unless they are prepared to be constructive " .
Ahead of his own trip to the Middle East before Christmas , Mr Blair repeated that as his premiership drew to a close he still regarded it as the most important issue facing the world .
The prime minister repeatedly reiterated his personal revulsion at the current conference , sponsored by the Tehran government , on the reality of the Holocaust , calling it " disgusting , unbelievable and shocking " .
Speaking at his final monthly press conference of 2006 , the PM said Mr Ahmadinejad s government was " deliberately causing maximum problems for moderate governments and for ourselves in the region - in Palestine , in Lebanon and in Iraq " .
" There is no point in hiding the fact that Iran poses a major strategic threat to the cohesion of the entire region , " Mr Blair told reporters .
Mr Blair said that he found the conference organised by Iran which questioned existence of the Holocaust " shocking beyond belief " .
" To go and invite the former head of the Ku Klux Klan to a conference in Tehran which disputes the millions of people who died in the Holocaust , what further evidence do you need to have that this regime is extreme ? " he asked .
He told a journalist from Israeli radio that the conference was a " disgusting " affront to the millions of families who lost relatives in the Holocaust .
It was " such a symbol of sectarianism and hatred towards a people " he added .
More than half the hour - long press conference focused on the Middle East , with Mr Blair quizzed on whether the UK could withdraw from Iraq in advance of the US , or in tandem with it .
He said the situation for UK troops in Basra was different from that for US troops in Baghdad , where there was more sectarian violence , but the UK withdrawal would not be affected by US decisions .
" If and when they [ US troops ] are able to change the situation in Baghdad , then they too will be in a different set of circumstances , but the pace at which both of those things may happen may be different , " Mr Blair said .
Mr Blair said it was still the intention to withdraw British troops once Iraqi authorities were able to take over .
" I certainly do not take the study group as saying that we should get out , come what may .
" What they are saying is that we have to increase our driving up of the capability of the Iraqi forces , because it 's obviously better that the Iraqis themselves take responsibility and indeed the Iraqi government is increasingly saying it wants to take responsibility .
" Then the coalition forces will still be in a support role but it wo n't be the same as it is at the moment . "
Asked about apparent UK opposition to the US policy of early de-Ba'athification of Iraq after the invasion , Mr Blair said the problems in Iraq were deliberately being caused by people opposed to the democratic process , and any decision on de-Ba'athification would not have changed that .
On the wider Israeli - Palestinian question , Mr Blair rejected comparisons of the peace process , where the UK government talked to Sinn Féin and the Democratic Unionists even at times when they refused to recognise each other .
" It is very difficult to see how you can negotiate with Hamas in circumstances where they are saying emphatically ' we deny the right of Israel to exist ' , " he said .
" There has to be a genuine willingness on their part - or at least on the parts of elements of Hamas - to engage in a meaningful way with Israel and I do n't notice that at the moment . "
Mr Blair said Hamas was being " deliberately unhelpful " .
" It is one thing to have a position about Israel which is your formal position ... but if you look at what they have been saying over the past few days it sounds to me , I am afraid , deliberately unhelpful .
" If you add up what has been said over the last few days about Israel - and not always in answer to a question either - then it 's quite difficult to see what the way forward is . "
The prime minister said he hoped to use his visit to make clear what the Palestinians could expect in return for progress .
" It is important for us to say very clearly ' this is what we will do if you are prepared to accept that any negotiation on two states must be on the basis of mutual respect and mutual recognition .
" One of the things I want to do in the course of the visit is to spell out exactly what we would do in those circumstances , for the Palestinians , including in respect of Hamas . "
Diebold voting systems critically flawed
Robert Lemos
SecurityFocus
Michael Shamos remembers that the call came late at night , during the last week of April .
 It is like the nuclear bomb for e-voting systems .
It 's the deal breaker .
It really makes the security flaws that we found ( in prior years ) look trivial . 
The call - - from election watchdog BlackBoxVoting.org -- described a critical vulnerability in Diebold Election Systems ' touchscreen voting systems that could allow any person with access to a voting terminal the ability to completely change the system code or ballot file on the system .
As a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University and adviser to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on electronic voting , Shamos realized that , at the very least , a workaround for the flaw needed to be in place by Pennsylvania 's next election -- at the time , less than three weeks away .
" This one is so bad , that we can't do just nothing , " Shamos told the state 's election officials at the time .
" Any losing candidate could challenge the election by saying , ' How do I know that the software on the machine is the software certified by the state ? ' "
Late Thursday , BlackBoxVoting published a redacted version of a paper describing the design flaw in Diebold AccuVote TSX and TS6 touchscreen election systems .
Because of the seriousness of the flaw , the full report detailing the issue has only been distributed to a limited group of computer scientists , state and federal election officials , and security groups .
" We have elections every single week this month , and there is no way to do meaningful remediation at this point , " said Bev Harris , founder of BlackBoxVoting .
Three states have already issued alerts on the flaws to election officials .
The Pennsylvania Department of State told county clerks to reinstall the software on election devices and then lock them up in a secure location until the May 16 general primary .
" The Department of State will furnish the authorized software to the counties on a PCMCIA card along with instructions for its installation , " a copy of the memo seen by Security Focus stated .
Both Iowa and California have also issued alerts , according to the Associated Press .
The incident represents the most major failure of the federal process to create secure election technology to date .
While researchers and civil rights groups have voiced strong criticism of electronic voting technology -- and in particular the systems ' security -- the national elections held in November 2004 saw only small problems that would likely not have impacted the outcome of the election .
However , trust remains a significant issue .
Voting machine makers and the certification labs that have tested election systems have been secretive about the technology .
And , while older machines and the method for counting votes tallied by the older technology were easily understood by the average voter , electronic voting systems have become more impenetrable and have not undergone significant and public testing , according to computer scientists that have called for more rigorous security testing .
Diebold has had a more turbulent relationship with states and security experts over e-voting .
The company 's CEO stepped down in December , a day before a law firm filed a shareholder suit against the company , claiming -- among other issues -- that the company misled investors about the state of its e-voting technology .
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced this week that it has opened an inquiry into how Diebold reports revenue , following the company 's admission in SEC filings that its election business overstated revenue and understated deferred revenue .
A representative of Diebold Election Systems could not immediately be reached for comment on the SEC inquiry or the design flaw , but Pennsylvania 's memo to election officials stated that the company had confirmed the vulnerability and acknowledged that the issue could be used to load malicious software on an election system .
" The probability for exploiting this vulnerability to install unauthorized software that could affect an election is considered low , " the memo to election officials stated .
" To exploit this risk , physical access is required to the Personal Computer Memory Card International Association ( PCMCIA ) slots on the machine during system startup . "
Other computer scientists do not believe the threat to be theoretical .
" It is like the nuclear bomb for e-voting systems , " said Avi Rubin , computer science professor at Johns Hopkins University .
" It 's the deal breaker .
It really makes the security flaws that we found ( in prior years ) look trivial . "
There is no real name for the movement that took over America six years ago and continues run it .
That 's part of the reason for its success .
Its very vagueness makes it hard to attack .
In actuality , it is not a single entity .
It is made up of three main parts .
Corporatism , which is based on the belief that whatever makes money is good -- and should not be restrained .
Neo-con megalomania , which is the belief that American power is absolute , irresistible , and always good , and should therefore be used -- without restraint .
And right - wing religion , which is the certainty that this movement 's form of Christianity is God-commanded ; therefore it should rule America and , through America , the world -- and any restraint against it is opposition to God .
To add to the confusion , this movement did not stand out on its own .
Its proponents entered into the existing Republican Party and the old Goldwater - Reagan conservative movement .
They brought those people along with them ( roughly half the voting population ) and ran for office under the guise of being Republicans and conservatives .
Most of what they said they stood for was in the mainstream .
Capitalism is good .
Being strong is good .
Education , financial security , and trade are good .
America is a good , idealistic country .
It 's good that America defeated its enemies in the past , like the Nazis and the Soviets , and it's a good idea that we remain capable of doing it in the future .
Faith and belief in a higher power is good .
We should be careful about foreign military adventures , though once we are attacked we have to be vigorous in our response and fight them over there before we have to fight them over here .
All that sounds reasonable , appealing , and familiar .
What distinguishes Bushism from old - line Republicanism and reasonable conservatism is not the names on their beliefs , it 's the quality of their beliefs .
The beliefs of Bushism are theological .
Theological thinking creates powerful and convincing rhetoric .
There are two reasons for this .
People with theological beliefs do n't mind lying .
It 's for the greater good .
This has been combined with the corporate attitude toward truth : " Coke adds life ! "
It does n't matter if it 's true or false , or absolutely meaningless .
If it moves the product , that 's what you say .
The result is spinning , which is more effective than straight - out lying .
For years , Bush was a master of spin .
If you analyze his speeches , it is exceedingly rare to find an outright lie that you can nail to the table .
Yet he was able to lead his listeners to conclusions that were absolutely false .
The classic example is in his 2003 State of the Union address , in which he said , " The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa . "
The substance was absolutely false .
He had been told as much by the CIA .
The consequences of creating a false impression were vast , tragic , and intensely stupid .
Yet , by putting the opening clause on it , citing the British government -- whose intelligence service did , at one time , think there was reason to believe it -- it is not , technically , a lie .
People with theological beliefs routinely lie to themselves .
In their theological minds , the theory is always true .
Only reality is flawed .
When the CIA stated that there was no substantive link between al - Qaeda and Iraq , Cheney disputed their claim and in effect said , " It must be true !
Find intelligence that does agree , or if you 're too incompetent , I 'll find it myself . "
Bush believes that cutting taxes always increases revenues and creates jobs .
Yet year after year , when the numbers came back and it did n't happen , the response was to insist on more tax cuts , because the theology says it has to happen .
Listening to Bush -- and Cheney and their supporters -- is exactly like listening to a Marxist explaining away Stalin .
And Mao , and the gulags , and the East German secret police , and the madness of Ceausescu .
They were a new force .
They believed completely in their cause and that they should have power .
They arrived cloaked in old and familiar and reassuring rhetoric , so they encountered little resistance , and conquered rapidly and thoroughly .
What is astonishing is how rapidly their ideas are being revealed as bankrupt .
The war in Iraq has demolished the myth of America 's unlimited power .
Iraq was the neo- cons ' great experiment in democracy and free - market capitalism .
The true believers really believed that simply by having people vote for a democratic - style government and sweeping away all restrictions on free markets , a little America would instantly emerge - - stable , friendly , prosperous , the envy of its neighbors .
Instead , it created a hell on Earth .
Anti-government government was exposed as bankrupt by Katrina .
Prosecutor - gate is revealing , quite rapidly , how the quest for power , fueled by theological righteousness , tossed out all other virtues -- like justice , fairness , and honesty .
Economists and pundits are behind the curve , but ordinary Americans get that Bush economics do not work for them .
And that what 's good for giant corporations is not necessarily what 's good for the USA .
Religion has been a sacred cow .
But the excesses of Christian power and the violent madness of Islamic fundamentalism have changed that .
Now atheist books are on the best - seller list .
Because it is necessary , it has become respectable to genuinely question why and how and what people believe .
Theological thinking , itself , has been revealed as bankrupt .
It is almost impossible to overstate how disastrous the eight years of Bush are going to turn out to be for the Republican Party and for the right .
It is not entirely visible yet , but this tumble downhill is going to turn out to be a fall off a cliff .
The Democrats , and the left , have a great opportunity here .
I hope they make something out of it , because those other people are dangerous idiots .
If they are going to , they can't simply fall back on their old rhetoric .
The world has changed .
It always changes .
It will keep changing .
They have to come up with something new .
Something that combines realism and good , hard - headed American pragmatism with ideals .
Then make it sound exciting .

Arizona authorities this week charged suspected members of a criminal ring thought responsible for 10 per cent of all fake money in the state after some members sent a printer , jammed with counterfeit bills , out for repair .
A three - month investigation by the U.S. Secret Service and the local sheriff 's office nabbed 10 suspects for crimes including forgery , weapons violations and drug charges , according to the Southwest Valley Republic .
The ring of counterfeiters allegedly included two Wal - Mart cashiers who accepted the fake bills as payment for big - ticket items in order to put the faux money into circulation .
The suspects would then go to a different Wal - Mart and return the items for cash , according to the news report .
The counterfeiters manufactured more than $ 160,000 , according to officials , most of which ended up in circulation .
Many software companies and printer makers add software to their products to make copying or printing currency nearly impossible .
Adobe Systems has quietly added technology to its graphics software to prevent consumers from copying and manipulating images of the world 's currency .
Hewlett - Packard also ships anti-counterfeiting measures in its printers , according to privacy expert Richard Smith .

Hugo Chavez must have it in mind to violate every law of economics in the book .
Price controls , nationalization , and now demonetization :
CARACAS , Venezuela , March 17 â € ”
Of all the startling measures announced by President Hugo ChÃ¡vez this year , from the nationalization of major utilities to threats of imprisonment for violators of price controls , none have baffled economists quite like his venture into monetary reform .
First , Mr. ChÃ¡vez said the authorities would remove three zeroes from the denomination of the currency , the bolÃ­var .
Then he said the new bolÃ­var , worth 1,000 old bolÃ­vars , would be renamed the â€œbolÃ­var fuerte , â€ or strong bolÃ­var .
Finally , at the behest of Mr. ChÃ¡vez , the central bank said this week that it would reintroduce a 12.5 - cent coin , a symbol of Venezuelaâ€™s prosperity in the 1960s and 1970s before freewheeling oil booms ended in abrupt devaluations , after three decades out of circulation .
Moves like this , of course , are common when countries are dealing with out of control inflation .
Instead of dealing with the root causes of the problem , which would require a dictator like Chavez to abandon his ambitious / insane plans for Venezuela ’s future , you simply change the monetary system and hope people will forget that the food they bought for 28,000 bolivars last week is the same as the food they ’re buying for 28 “ new bolivars ” this week .
And it would appear that at least some people realize this :
The decisions to rename the currency and reintroduce the unusual coin , known here as the locha , a term thought to derive from an anachronistic practice of dividing monetary units into eighths , have dumbfounded many Venezuelans .
More than a third of the countryâ€™s population of 26 million is under age 18 , with no memory of the coin , which stopped circulating in the 1970s .
â€ œI think that itâ€™s cheap psychology , â€ said Jhonny MÃ¡rquez , a manager at a transportation company .
â€ œI donâ€™t believe the inflation will go down .â€ Still , Mr. ChÃ¡vez , 52 , waxes nostalgic about the coin .
Citing â€ œthe respect Venezuelaâ€™s economy has around the worldâ€ in a transmission of his television talk show this month in which he announced the coinâ€™s return , Mr. ChÃ¡vez said , â€ œWeâ€™re going to end monetary instability in Venezuela.â€ 
Yea , sure you are .

Story Highlights • Presidential candidate says small force should remain past 2009
• New York senator says troops would fight terrorists , train Iraqis
• Scenario works only if Iraqis " get their act together , " she says
• Sen. Barack Obama laid out similar plan on Wednesday

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
If elected president , Sen. Hillary Clinton said , she would likely keep some U.S. forces in Iraq in a supporting role after 2009 because America has " a remaining military as well as a political mission " that requires a presence there .
However , in an interview with The New York Times published Thursday , Clinton said the American troops would not play a role in trying to curb sectarian violence .
Rather , they would be positioned north of Baghdad to combat terrorists , support the Kurds , counter any Iranian moves into Iraq and provide logistical , air and training support to the Iraqi government " if the Iraqis ever get their act together . "
" If there is not any political resolution , the civil war will continue and we need to get out of the way , " she told the Times .
( Watch how Americans think the war is going )
Clinton aides say her comments are consistent with a broader plan by Democrats in Congress to begin redeploying combat troops , with the goal of having U.S. forces out of Iraq by March 2008 .
However , some political analysts say her support for a continued presence in Iraq could touch a raw nerve with anti-war Democrats .
" They 're really not sure that she 's with them on Iraq and other issues , " said Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia 's Center for Politics .
" So they 're suspicious , and that suspicion shows itself in what they say about her . "
In 2002 , Clinton voted for a congressional resolution authorizing President Bush to take military action in Iraq .
And although she 's become a vocal critic of the way the war has been executed , she has repeatedly refused demands from anti-war Democrats to admit her vote was a mistake , although she has said " knowing what I know now , I would not have voted for it . "
Of her two closest rivals for the Democratic nomination , former Sen. John Edwards , has said his vote in favor of the 2002 resolution was a mistake ; Sen .
Barack Obama was still a state legislator in Illinois at the time of that vote , but he has opposed the war from the beginning .
Wednesday , Obama outlined a plan for maintaining a U.S. presence in Iraq similar to Clinton's .
" Withdrawal would be gradual , and we'd keep some U.S. troops in the region to prevent a wide war , to go after al Qaeda and other terrorists , " he said .
The question is whether , given her previous record on Iraq , Clinton 's call for continuing a U.S. presence might resonate differently with anti-war activists .
" They are not inclined to cut her much slack , " Sabato said .
" They are inclined to cut Barack Obama quite a bit of slack and John Edwards some slack as well . "
In Outliving the Great Variable Shortage , Tim Ottinger invokes Curly 's Law :
A variable should mean one thing , and one thing only .
It should not mean one thing in one circumstance , and carry a different value from a different domain some other time .
It should not mean two things at once .
It must not be both a floor polish and a dessert topping .
It should mean One Thing , and should mean it all of the time .
The late , great Jack Palance played grizzled cowboy Curly Washburn in the 1991 comedy City Slickers .
Curly 's
Law is defined in this bit of dialog from the movie :
Curly :
Do you know what the secret of life is ?
Curly : This .
[ holds up one finger ]
Mitch : Your finger ?
Curly :
One thing .
Just one thing .
You stick to that and the rest do n't mean shit .
Mitch :
But what is the " one thing ? "
Curly : [ smiles ]
That 's what you have to find out .
Curly 's Law , Do One
Thing , is reflected in several core principles of modern software development :
Do n't Repeat Yourself
If you have more than one way to express the same thing , at some point the two or three different representations will most likely fall out of step with each other .
Even if they do n't , you 're guaranteeing yourself the headache of maintaining them in parallel whenever a change occurs .
And change will occur .
Do n't repeat yourself is important if you want flexible and maintainable software .

And change occur .
Do n't repeat yourself is important if you want flexible and maintainable software .
Once and Only Once
Each and every declaration of behavior should occur once , and only once .
This is one of the main goals , if not the main goal , when refactoring code .
The design goal is to eliminate duplicated declarations of behavior , typically by merging them or replacing multiple similar implementations with a unifying abstraction .

The design goal is to eliminate duplicated declarations of behavior , typically by merging them or replacing multiple similar implementations with a unifying abstraction .
Single Point of Truth
Repetition leads to inconsistency and code that is subtly broken , because you changed only some repetitions when you needed to change all of them .
Often , it also means that you have n't properly thought through the organization of your code .
Any time you see duplicate code , that 's a danger sign .
Complexity is a cost ; do n't pay it twice .
Although Curly's Law definitely applies to normalization and removing redundancies , Do One Thing is more nuanced than the various restatements of Do Each Thing Once outlined above .
It runs deeper .
Bob Martin refers to it as The Single Responsibility Principle :
The Single Responsibility Principle says that a class should have one , and only one , reason to change .
As an example , imagine the following class : class Employee { public Money calculatePay ( ) public void save ( ) public String reportHours ( ) }
This class violates the SRP because it has three reasons to change :
The business rules having to do with calculating pay .
The database schema .
The format of the string that reports hours .
We do n't want a single class to be impacted by these three completely different forces .
We do n't want to modify the Employee class every time the accounts decide to change the format of the hourly report , or every time the DBAs make a change to the database schema , as well as every time the managers change the payroll calculation .
Rather , we want to separate these functions out into different classes so that they can change independently of each other .
Curly 's Law is about choosing a single , clearly defined goal for any particular bit of code : Do One Thing .
That much is clear .
But in choosing one thing , you are ruling out an infinite universe of other possible things you could have done .
Curly 's Law also means consciously choosing what your code wo n't do .
This is much more difficult than choosing what to do , because it runs counter to all the natural generalist tendencies of software developers .
It could mean breaking code apart , violating traditional OOP rules , or introducing duplicate code .
It 's taking one step backward to go two steps forward .
Each variable , each line of code , each function , each class , each project should Do One Thing .
Unfortunately , we usually do n't find out what that one thing is until we 've reached the end of it .
From KurzweilAI.net
I learn that Marvin Minsky has given an interview to Discover magazine here .
Minsky is one of the pioneers of artificial intelligence , and he is a very articulate and outspoken character .
In the interview he comments on the activities of neuroscientists .
Q ( Discover ) .
Neuroscientists ' quest to understand consciousness is a hot topic right now , yet you often pose things via psychology , which seems to be taken less seriously .
Are you behind the curve ?
A ( Minsky ) .
I do n't see neuroscience as serious .
What they have are nutty little theories , and they do elaborate experiments to confirm them and do n't know what to do if they do n't work .
This book [ The Emotion Machine ] presents a very elaborate theory of consciousness .
Consciousness is a word that confuses possibly 16 different processes .
Most neurologists think everything is either conscious or not .
But even Freud had several grades of consciousness .
When you talk to neuroscientists , they seem so unsophisticated ; they major in biology and know about potassium and calcium channels , but they do n't have sophisticated psychological ideas .
Neuroscientists should be asking :
What phenomenon should I try to explain ?
Can I make a theory of it ?
Then , can I design an experiment to see if one of those theories is better than the others ?
If you do n't have two theories , then you can't do an experiment .
And they usually do n't even have one .
I 'm sure the activities of neuroscientists are well - intentioned , as they adopt a reductionist approach to the analysis of a highly complex system ( i.e. the brain ) by working upwards from the detailed behaviour of individual neurons .
However , neuroscientists ' theorising about AI is bound to be wildly off - target , since AI lives at a much higher level than the relatively low level where they are working .
Tracing the detailed neural circuitry of small parts of the brain ( or even the entire brain ) will not lead to AI ; discovering the underlying principles of AI ( whatever those turn out to be ) will lead to AI , and it will not necessarily need biological neurons to " live " in .
In the early 1980 's I jumped on the " neural network " bandwagon that had restarted around that time .
There was a lot of hype back then that this was the rigorous answer to understanding how the brain worked , and it took me a few years to convince myself that this claim was rubbish ; the " neural network " bandwagon was based solely on some neat mathematical tricks that emerged around that time ( e.g. back - propagation for training multi- layer networks , etc ) , rather than better insight into information processing or even AI .
My rather belated response was to " rebadge " my research programme by avoiding use of the phrase " neural networks " , and instead using phrases like " adaptive networks " and the like ; I was n't alone in using this tactical response .
Q ( Discover ) .
So as you see it , artificial intelligence is the lens through which to look at the mind and unlock the secrets of how it works ?
A ( Minsky ) .
Yes , through the lens of building a simulation .
If a theory is very simple , you can use mathematics to predict what it 'll do .
If it 's very complicated , you have to do a simulation .
It seems to me that for anything as complicated as the mind or brain , the only way to test a theory is to simulate it and see what it does .
One problem is that often researchers wo n't tell us what a simulation did n't do .
Right now the most popular approach in artificial intelligence is making probabilistic models .
The researchers say , " Oh , we got our machine to recognize handwritten characters with a reliability of 79 percent . "
They do n't tell us what did n't work .
This caricature of the cargo - cult science that passes itself off as genuine science made me laugh .
As it happens , I use ( a variant of ) the probabilistic models that Minsky alludes to , and I find the literature on the subject unbelievably frustrating to read .
A typical paper will contain an introduction , some theory , a computer simulation to illustrate an application of the theory , and a pathetically inadequate interpretation of what it all means .
The most important part of a paper ( the " take home message " , if you wish ) is the interpretation of the results that it reports ; this comprises the new conceptual tools that I want to take away with me to apply elsewhere .
Unfortunately , the emphasis is usually on presenting results from a wide variety of computer simulations and comparisons with competing techniques , which certainly fills up the journal pages , but it does n't do much to advance our understanding of what is going on .
Where are the conceptual tools ?
This is like doing " butterfly " collecting rather than doing science .
We need some rigorous organisational principles to help us gain a better understanding of our large collection of " butterflies " , rather than taking the easy option of simply catching more " butterflies " .
It seems to me that the situation in AI is analogous to , but much more difficult than , the situation in high energy physics during the 1950's and 1960's , when the " zoo " of strongly interacting particles grew to alarming proportions , and we explained what was going on only when the eightfold way and the quark model of hadrons were proposed .
I wonder if there are elementary degrees of freedom underlying AI that are analogous to the quark ( and gluon ) DOF in hadrons .
I 'll bet that the " elementary " DOF of AI involve the complicated ( strong ? ) mutual interaction of many neurons , just as the " elementary " DOF in strong interactions are not actually elementary quarks but are composite entities built out of quarks ( and gluons ) .
I 'll also bet that we wo n't guess what the " elementary " DOF of AI are by observing the behaviour of individual neurons ( or even small sets of neurons ) , but we will postdict ( rather than predict ) these DOF after someone ( luckily ) observes interesting information processing happening in the collective behavour of large sets of neurons , or if someone ( even more luckily ) has a deep insight into the theory of information processing in large networks of interacting processing units .

Holland to allow ‘ baby euthanasia ’
Each year in Holland at least 15 seriously ill babies , most of them with severe spina bifida or chromosomal abnormalities , are helped to die by doctors acting with the parents ’ consent .
But only a fraction of those cases are reported to the authorities because of the doctors ’ fears of being charged with murder .
Things are about to change , however , making it much easier for parents and doctors to end the suffering of an infant .
A committee set up to regulate the practice will begin operating in the next few weeks , effectively making Holland , where adult euthanasia is legal , the first country in the world to allow “ baby euthanasia ” as well .
The Cheney shooting story is n't about to die down .
I predict that the press is going to run with this story for days , if not weeks -- and it has very little to do with the possibility of Cheney 's being drunk , or with the 18 hour delay , or anything else .
And this story is going to be much bigger than what we 've seen so far in the White House Press Briefings .
It 's because this story is a perfect metaphor for this administration 's foreign and domestic policy .
It says everything you need to know about Dick Cheney personally , and the way this entire administration operates .
And the press does this all the time : they run with little things that display flaws in character : Al Gore 's " Internet " quote to highlight his weakness for exaggeration ; Kerry 's " Voted for it before I voted against it " to highlight his weakness for equivocation .
In this case , we have Cheney and the entire Bush Administration foreign and domestic policy in a nutshell .
Especially in Iraq and Katrina .
In this case , Cheney and friends were killing innocent creatures who were trapped in a pen with no hope of escape .
Overeager , Cheney hunted with a shoot first , ask questions later mentality , and managed to strike his own partner , and send his friend to intensive care .
It later appears that Bush and his situation room ( or so they said ) had no idea what was going on on the ground there .
They waited an entire day to even report the story , even though they obviously knew what happened .
Hell , someone else had to force them to report the story , because they sure were n't going to unless they had to .
The official story then has Cheney blaming the victim , saying it was the victim 's fault he got in Cheney 's way .
It starts to become clear there was a pretty big hush - hush coverup job about it , but that the truth could n't help but get leaked , despite the Administration 's best wishes .
There is even speculation that Cheney was possibly intoxicated , and not using his best intelligence before he started shooting .
And , of course , they could n't afford to admit the truth , because the truth would probably be an impeachable offense .
---------------------------------------------------------
It 's a perfect analogy for the way they have conducted their entire administration -- and all the biggest flaws of this presidency are on display in one little vividly portrayed story .
A little story that has tremendous sway because , let 's face it : THE VICE PRESIDENT JUST ACTUALLY SHOT ANOTHER HUMAN BEING .
The imagery is clear and potent -- and not subject to the typical political " he said , she said . "
There is no way to play the usual equivocating politics with a story about the vice - president ACTUALLY SHOOTING SOMEONE .
And that 's why I guarantee you this story is n't going away :
It 's a perfect way for the press to indict the entire Administration through the perfect metaphor .
And they 'll be able to do it without retribution , or accusations that both sides are n't being fairly presented .
And it 's going to haunt these assholes for a long , long time , if my hunch is correct .
( Cross - posted on my blog There Is No Blog : Bending Left )
Recently , a blogger named Simon Owens ran a social experiment on Craigslist .
He wandered into the “ Casual Encounters ” section of the personal ads where countless men and women were soliticing for no -strings - attached sex and wondered , Is it really that easy ?
As a test , he composed several ads with different permutations of assumed identity and sexual orientation : straight / bi men / women looking for the opposite / same sex .
He then posted it to New York , Chicago , and Houston , and tallied the results .
Overwhelmingly and instantly , the ads from the fake women looking for male partners were inundated with responses , sometimes several per minute .
All the other ads received lukewarm responses , at best .
These results were n’t surprising , but some of the observations were …
Many of these men used their real names and included personally identifiable information , including work email addresses and home phone numbers .
Several admitted they were married and cheating on their spouses .
Many included photos , often nude .
His first conclusion was very reasonable : “ If a really malicious person wanted to get on craigslist and ruin a lot of people ’s lives , he easily could . ”
Jason Fortuny ’s Craigslist Experiment
On Monday , a Seattle web developer named Jason Fortuny started his own Craigslist experiment .
The goal : “ Posing as a submissive woman looking for an aggressive dom , how many responses can we get in 24 hours ? ”
He took the text and photo from a sexually explicit ad ( warning : not safe for work ) in another area , reposted it to Craigslist Seattle , and waited for the responses to roll in .
Like Simon ’s experiment , the response was immediate .
He wrote , “ 178 responses , with 145 photos of men in various states of undress .
Responses include full e-mail addresses ( both personal and business addresses ) , names , and in some cases IM screen names and telephone numbers . ”
In a staggering move , he then published every single response , unedited and uncensored , with all photos and personal information to Encyclopedia Dramatica ( kinda like Wikipedia for web fads and Internet drama ) .
Read the responses ( warning : sexually explicit material ) .
Instantly , commenters on the LiveJournal thread started identifying the men .
Dissenters emailed the guys to let them know they were scammed .
Several of them were married , which has led to what will likely be the first of many separations .
One couple in an open marriage begged that their information be removed , as their religious family and friends were n’t aware of their lifestyle .
Another spotted a fellow Microsoft employee , based on their e-mail address .
And it ’s really just the beginning , since the major search engines have n’t indexed these pages yet .
After that , who knows ?
Divorces , firings , lawsuits , and the assorted hell that come from having your personal sex life listed as the first search result for your name .
Possibly the strangest thing about this sex baiting prank is that the man behind it is unabashedly open about his own identity .
A graphic artist in Kirkland , Washington , Jason has repeatedly posted his contact information , including home phone , address , and photos .
He ’s already received one threat of physical violence .
Is he oblivious to the danger , or does he just not care ?
Since his stated interest is “ pushing people ’s buttons , ” I ’m guessing the latter .
( See update : Jason ’s been removing contact information from his sites , so some of these links are now broken . )
Legality and Privacy
But was any law actually broken ?
Fortuny obviously misrepresented himself under false pretenses , which is itself possibly actionable , but the privacy implications beyond that are very interesting .
Does emailing someone your personal information act as an implicit waiver of your right to privacy ?
I ’m not a lawyer , but as far as I can tell , no .
If taken to court , he ’s at risk of two primary civil claims .
“ Intentional infliction of emotional distress , ” while notoriously hard to prove in court , is certainly easier here based on his own writings .
The second , more relevant claim , is “ public disclosure of private facts . ”
This Findlaw article on the Washingtonienne scandal sums it up nicely :
The disclosure must be public .
The facts must be private .
The plaintiff must be identified .
The publication must be “ highly offensive . ”
And there must be an “ absence of legitimate concern to the public ” with respect to the publication .
It certainly seems like this clearly fits the criteria for a tort claim , but I ’d love to hear some legal interpretation from the law bloggers out there .
Does volunteering your information in a private context somehow invalidate your privacy rights ?
I do n’t think so .
( For more information , see the EFF ’s Bloggers ’ FAQ on Privacy . )
I contacted Anil Dash , VP of LiveJournal ’s parent company Six Apart , to see how he felt about the breaking drama .
He was clearly disturbed by it , but after contacting LJ ’s support staff , realized there was n’t much they could do .
If they find abusive information , they act quickly to remove it , but in this case , all the identifiable information is on a third - party site .
“ There are always people who are n’t going to be productive members of a community .
We try to be consistent in honoring requests if an individual ’s personal info is being posted without their permission , ” said Anil .
“ The hard part , of course , is that nobody can control every site on the web , so there ’s always somewhere else for a person to go if they really want to be malicious or destructive .. ”
I have n’t contacted Craigslist , but it ’s clear that as this story develops , it will inevitably have a profound impact on the community .
A friend put it simply : “ Adults are stupid on the Internet . ”
More likely , their expectations of privacy just have n’t been fundamentally challenged yet .
They send naked photos of themselves to strangers because it helps get them noticed by the women they ’re emailing , and it ’s never backfired on them .
On a final note , this is just getting started .
Sex baiting is so simple and so effective , I thought immediately that others would be inspired to do the same thing .
And yesterday morning , a commenter confirmed that the first copycat prank is already complete in Craigslist Portland .
94 replies so far , with 60 photos .
It wo n’t be the last .
September 10 : Jason Fortuny modified his homepage to remove all references to his professional life : portfolio , resume , and references to past clients are all gone .
( Compare to the older versions on the Internet Archive . )
It also looks like he ’s been scrubbing his personal contact information from his Livejournal comments and homepage .
For example , this link from my post originally went to a comment with his contact information , but it ’s been removed entirely .
( Strangely , he did n’t remove his home address and phone number from this entry . )
Also , Encyclopedia Dramatica has been down intermittently all day , presumably because of the traffic .
September 11 : Jason Fortuny ’s web server is now down entirely , possibly because of today ’s Slashdot coverage .
( One commenter claims to live in the same apartment building as Fortuny . )
Other recent notable media mentions : BBC News , and Wired ’s Ryan Singel has coverage and a response to commenters .
The New York Times article is slated for tomorrow was written , but ultimately rejected for publication .
Update , Part 2 : Jason Fortuny sent an email to Tucker Max for advice ( himself Internet - famous for posting his sexual exploits online ) .
In the email , Jason notes that he ’s been flooded with thousands of phone calls and has since changed his phone number .
In a followup post to that message board , he states clearly he wants to capitalize on the controversy : “ Let ’s milk this .
All the way …
There must be a way to combine this .
Into money .
Money is important .
Money is good . ”
He ’s planning on setting up a dedicated website for his exploits , either on his Rfjason.com site or on the Craigslistsexbaits.com domain registered by Tucker Max .
He also distances himself from Encyclopedia Dramatica , claiming that they scraped his Livejournal and that he has little control over the site , but is “ working to get the personally identifiably information redacted . ”
( This does n’t make sense , since he claims to have editing rights on the protected page . )
For more information , read the complete set of his posts and his friend Wendy Miller .
Update 3 : My site ’s been down for the last hour , but it was completely unrelated to this entry or the recent Slashdotting .
EV1 Servers , my usually reliable web host , had an hour of downtime affecting hundreds of thousands of websites .
Update 4 : The Associated Press just published an article , which will be syndicated in newspapers everywhere tomorrow .
Some good quotes from Craigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster , Kurt Opsahl from the Electronic Freedom Foundation , and the ubiquitous Jonathan Zittrain .
Also , a couple more interesting comments from the Slashdot thread from people who claim to know Fortuny in real life .
The first from someone who went to high school with him , and the second from an anonymous former friend .
September 12 : For unknown reasons , the entire thread from the Tucker Max message board was removed along with Jason Fortuny ’s username .
Fortunately , Yahoo cached the thread .
Fortuny ’s most interest post is quoted below , in case the cache disappears .
Fortuny writes :
This is some next level shit .
I keep hearing Janet Jackson ’s “ Black Cat ” lyrics in my head over and over .
1 . Let ’s milk this .
All the way .
When I ’m in my element , there ’s no limit to the shit I can stir up , so there ’s more material to be had .
I like entertaining .
I like good attention .
I ’ve always wanted to have a late night talk show .
Letterman is my fucking hero .
Stupid people drive me insane and make me very animated .
There must be a way to combine this .
Into money .
Money is important .
Money is good .
2 . I removed the posts from my website , rfjason.com , after the 1st day because I could n’t handle the traffic .
The good people at Encyclopedia Dramatica ( friends of mine ) scraped the content , and turned it into a formal wiki .
While I have editing rights , I am not a staff member of , nor do I have any control over ED .
They are a very separate entity .
I am working to get the personally identifiably information redacted .
Hopefully they ’ll be nice , but I suspect I ’ll have to buy some pixel ads or some such shit .
3 . Let ’s go for craigslistsexbait.com .
I ’m not sure how this functions compared to rfjason.com , my regular site that everyone is linking to .
( Note : rfjason.com is also my business site that had a non-professional personal.rfjason.com tacked on .
I have since pulled the business element and put my shitty ass non-professional stuff front & center , because I detest the idea of admitting internet defeat with a blank site . )
4 . I have no head for business in this arena .
Sure , I can tell you all about the best ways to handle eCommerce and customer service standards , how to build a solid web server , and ( LOL ) privacy , but the notoriety business is new .
I require the help of Rudius Media .
Let ’s get that rolling .
5 . The lawsuits may or may not happen .
I have e-lawyers arguing all over the place both sides of the issue .
CL ’s tos clause 3 . CONTENT could be interpreted that there ’s no expectation of privacy , depending on how intelligently you argue the case .
Since I ’m apparently a sociopath , I could argue this pretty well .
But I ’m not a lawyer .
Is there any lawyer in Washington who would n’t laugh this out of his court ?
6 . Now that I ’m going to be a big star , here ’s a naked picture of me with solar flares coming out of my ass ( nsfwahd ) : http://rfjason.com/temp/solarass.jpg
Have I missed anything ?
It ’s also worth noting that Fortuny has been noticeably quiet over the past couple days .
He ’s posted a couple Livejournal comments , but no new entries since Sunday afternoon .
Also , MSNBC covered this on air today ( here ’s the video ) .
September 13 : My good friend
Lou posted an exhaustive and very personal profile of Fortuny based on his online writings .
Highly recommended reading , and gives quite a bit of insight into his possible motivations .
September 14 : Jason ’s been laying low for days .
A llocal news station actually interviewed one of the guys , whose embarrassment seems to be trumped by two minutes of on - air fame .
Unless there ’s a lawsuit or a lynching , I think I ’m pretty much done with this story .
September 18 : Lou Cabron breaks the story of a copycat scammer named Michael Crook , who has posted multiple ads to various Craigslist cities .
Unlike Fortuny ’s ad , this one was pretty mild , without graphic photos or a fetish angle .
Michael is now posting the responses to a new site called Craigslist - Perverts.org , often researching the identities of each respondent .
September 24 : Jason Fortuny responds in an informal 29 - minute video interview .
Lou Cabron from 10 Zen Monkeys wrote up an excellent summary of the interesting parts to save you the trouble of watching it .
Despite all the threats , according to Fortuny , he has n’t received a lawsuit , or even a cease - and - desist letter .
August 5 , 2008 : Two years later , and shortly after his New York Times interview , Jason Fortuny was sued for his Craigslist experiment .
April 18 , 2009 : Jason Fortuny lost his court case and was ordered to pay $ 74 k to the anonymous plaintiff .

Introduction
Hi there .
In the summer of 1997 , I was 28 years old , and I decided that after years of thinking about writing a novel , I was simply going to go ahead and write one .
There were two motivations for doing so .
First , I was simply curious if I could ; I 'd had up to that time a reasonably successful life as a writer , but I 'd never written anything longer than ten pages in my life outside of a classroom setting .
Two , my ten - year high school reunion was coming up , and I wanted to be able to say I 'd finished a novel just in case anyone asked ( they did n't , the bastards ) .
In sitting down to write the novel , I decided to make it easy on myself .
I decided first that I was n't going to try to write something near and dear to my heart , just a fun story .
That way , if I screwed it up ( which was a real possibility ) , it was n't like I was screwing up the One Story That Mattered To Me .
I decided also that the goal of writing the novel was the actual writing of it -- not the selling of it , which is usually the goal of a novelist .
I did n't want to worry about whether it was good enough to sell ; I just wanted to have the experience of writing a story over the length of a novel , and see what I thought about it .
Not every writer is a novelist ; I wanted to see if I was .
Making these two decisions freed me from a lot of the usual angst and pain that comes from writing a first novel .
This was in all respects a " practice " novel -- a setting for me to play with the form to see what worked , and what did n't , and what I 'd need to do to make the next novel worth selling .
It worked .
I picked a fun , humorous story -- aliens from another world decide to get an agent -- and I just let it take me where it wanted to go .
I banged out the chapters on the weekends , using the weekdays to let my mind figure out what to do next .
The writing was fun , and for the most part it was easy , and in three months , the whole thing was done ( and just in time for my high - school reunion ) .
Once the novel was finished , I decided , what the heck , I might as well try to sell it .
This was not particularly successful .
The agents I shopped it to liked the writing , but said humorous SF was hard place ; the publishers liked the writing but said humorous SF was hard to sell .
I was n't terribly put out about this ; this was a practice novel , after all .
But on the other hand I thought it was good enough to let other people see it .
So in early 1999 , I decided to put it online as a " shareware novel . "
The premise was simple : People could read it , and if they liked it , they could send me a dollar , or whatever sum they liked ( even if that sum was zero ) .
If they did n't like it , well , clearly , they would n't have to send me anything .
It was a no -risk proposition for the reader .
I did n't expect to see a dime from it , but as it turns out , over five years I made about $ 4,000 ( well , I think it was about that much .
I stopped counting after a while .
I know I made enough to buy a laptop and lots of pizzas .
More than enough ) .
Fast forward to today .
My second novel , Old Man's War , did indeed sell to a publisher , thanks in no small part to the experience earned writing this novel .
And between the writing of this novel and the publication of that one , five other books slipped out of my brain , due in some measure to my confidence that I could write book - length works , be they fiction or non-fiction .
In a sense , this novel is the midwife to every book since .
For this reason alone , it holds a special place in my heart .
It does n't hurt that it 's a fun story , too .
And now here it is for you to read .
I 'm no longer soliciting a dollar if you enjoy the novel ; the story has long since proved its worth in that respect .
I offer it freely to give new readers a sample of my writing ( perchance to tempt them to pick up one of the other books ) , and to say " thanks " to those who picked up another of my books and were curious enough about the author to find their way here .
I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it , and have enjoyed all the writing since .

Chapter One
" Fourteen million and 15 % of the gross ?
For Michelle Beck ?
You 're out of your fucking mind , Tom . "
Headsets are a godsend ; they allow you to speak on the phone while leaving your hands free for the truly important things .
My hands were currently occupied with a blue rubber racquetball , which I was lightly bouncing off the pane of my office window .
Each quiet thock left a tiny imprint on the glass .
It looked like a litter of poodles had levitated six feet off the ground and schmooged their noses against the window .
Someone would eventually have to wipe them all off .
" I 've had my medication for today , Brad , " I said .
" Believe me , 14 million and 15 points is a perfectly sane figure , from my client 's point of view . "
" She 's not worth anywhere near that much , " Brad said .
" A year ago she was paid $ 375,000 , flat .
I know .
I wrote the check . "
" A year ago , Summertime Blues had n't hit the theaters , Brad .
It 's now $ 220 million dollars later .
Not to mention your own Murdered Earth -- $ 85 million for perhaps the worst film in recent history .
And that 's before foreign , where no one will notice that there 's no plot .
I 'd say you got your one cheap taste .
Now you 've gotta pay . "
" Murdered Earth was n't that bad .
And she was n't the star . "
" I quote Variety , " I said , catching the ball left - handed for the briefest of seconds before hurling it back against the glass , " ' Murdered Earth is the sort of film you hope never makes it to broadcast television , because nearby aliens might pick up its broadcast signal and use it as an excuse to annihilate us all . '
That was one of the nicer comments .
And if she was n't the star , why did you plaster her all over the posters and give her second billing ? "
" What are you all about ? " Brad said .
" I remember you practically doing me for that artwork and billing . "
" So you 're saying you 'll do anything I say ?
Great !
Fourteen million and 15 % of the gross .
Gee , that was easy . "
The door opened .
I turned away from the window to face my desk .
Miranda Escalon , my administrative assistant , entered my office and slipped me a note .
Michelle just called , it read .
Remember that you have to get them to pay for her hairdresser and makeup artist .
" Look , Tom , " Brad said .
" You know we want Michelle .
But you 're asking too much .
Allen is getting $ 20 million and 20 % of the gross .
If we give Michelle what she wants , that 's $ 35 million and a third of the gross right there .
Where do you suggest we might make a profit ? "
$ 14 million , she can pay for her own damn hair , I wrote on the pad .
Miranda read it and raised her eyebrows .
She left the room .
The odds of her actually giving that message to Michelle were unimaginably remote .
She 's not paid to do everything I say -- she 's paid to do everything I should say .
There 's a difference .
" I have two points to make here , " I said , turning my attention back to Brad .
" First : Allen Green is n't my client .
If he were , I 'd be endlessly fascinated by the amount of money you 're throwing to him .
But he is not .
Therefore , I could not possibly give two shits about what you 're handing him .
My responsibility is to my client and getting a fair deal for her .
Second : $ 20 million for Allen Green ?
You 're an idiot . "
" Allen Green is a major star . "
" Allen Green was a major star , " I said , " When I was in high school .
I 'm about to go back for my 10th year reunion .
He 's been out in the wilderness for a long time , Brad .
Michelle , on the other hand , is a major star .
Right now .
$ 300 million in her last two films .
Fourteen million is a bargain . "
The door opened .
Miranda popped her head in .
She 's back , she mouthed .
" Tom , " Brad began .
" Hold on a second , Brad .
The woman herself is on the other line . "
I cut him off before he could say anything .
" What ? " I said to Miranda .
" Miss Thing says she has to talk to you right now about something very important that can't wait . "
" Tell her I 'm already working on the hairdresser . "
" No , it 's even more important than that , " Miranda said .
" From the sound of it , it may be the most important thing ever in the history of mankind .
Even more important than the invention of liposuction . "
" Do n't be mocking liposuction , Miranda .
It has extended the career of many an actress , thus benefiting their agents , allowing them to pay your salary .
Liposuction is your friend . "
" Line two , " Miranda said .
" Let me know if fat - sucking is toppled . "
I punched the button for line two .
Ambient street noise filled my earphones .
Michelle was undoubtedly careening along Santa Monica Boulevard .
" Michelle , " I said .
" I 'm trying to make you very rich .
Whatever it is , make it quick . "
" Ellen Merlow got Hard Memories . "
Michelle said .
" I thought I was in the running for that .
I thought I had it . "
" Do n't feel too bad about it , Michelle , " I said .
" Everyone was up for that one .
If you did n't get it , that puts you in there with Jessica Lange and Meryl Streep .
You 're in good company .
Besides , the pay was n't that good . "
I heard a short brake squeal , followed by a horn and some muffled yelling .
Michelle had cut someone off .
" Tom , I need roles like that , you know ?
I do n't want to be doing Summertime Blues for the next ten years .
This role would have helped me stretch .
I want to work on my craft . "
At the word craft , I mimed stabbing myself in the eye .
" Michelle , right now you 're the biggest female star in Hollywood .
Let 's work with that for a couple of movies , okay ?
Get a nice nest egg .
Your craft will still be there later . "
" I 'm right for this role , Tom . "
" The role is a 40ish Jewish woman victimized in the Warsaw ghetto and Treblinka , who then fights racism in the United States , " I said .
" You 're 25 .
And you 're blonde . "
And you think Treblinka is a shop on Melrose .
I kept that last thought in my head .
No point confusing her .
" Jessica Lange is blonde . "
" Jessica Lange also has two Oscars , " I said .
" So does Ellen , for that matter .
One in each acting category .
And she 's also not 25 , or blonde .
Michelle , let it go .
If you want to work on your craft , we can get you into some live theater .
That 's craft .
Craft up the wazoo .
They 're doing Doll 's House over at the Dorothy Chandler .
You 'll love it . "
" Tom , I want that part . "
" We 'll talk about it later , Michelle .
I 've got to get back to Brad .
Gotta go .
We 'll talk soon . "
" Remember to tell him about the hair - - " I clicked her off and switched Brad back on .
" Sorry , Brad . "
" I hope she was telling you not to blow this offer by asking for too much , " Brad said .
" Actually , she was telling me about another project she 's really passionate about , " I said .
" Hard Memories . "
" Oh , come on , " Brad said .
" She 's a little young and blonde to be playing Yentl , is n't she ?
Anyway , Ellen Merlow just got that part .
Read it in the Times today . "
" Since when does the Times get anything right ?
Michelle 's a little young for the part , yes , but that 's what makeup is for .
She 's a draw .
Could get a whole other audience for serious drama . "
Brad snorted .
" She wo n't be getting fourteen million for that , " he said .
" That 's their entire budget . "
" No , but she 'll be working on her craft , " I said .
I popped the ball up and down on my desk .
" The Academy eats that stuff up .
It 's a nomination , easy .
Like Cher in Silkwood . "
Sometimes I can't believe what comes out of my own mouth .
But it was working .
I could hear Brad weighing the options in his mind .
The project at hand was the sequel to Murdered Earth -- called , in a burst of true creativity , Earth Resurrected .
They had a problem : they killed off the hero in the first film .
Which as just as well , since Mark Glavin , who played him , was a loser who was well on his way to replicating the career arc of Mickey Rourke .
So when it came to the sequel , they had to build it around Michelle , whose character managed to survive .
The script had been written , the casting completed , and the pre-production was rolling along under a full head of steam .
Stopping now to recast or rewrite was not an option .
They were over a barrel -- they knew it and I knew it .
What we were arguing about now was the size of the barrel .
Miranda 's head popped through the door again .
I glared at her .
She shook her head .
Not her , she mouthed .
Carl .
I set the ball down .
When ?
I mouthed .
Three minutes , she mouthed .
" Brad , listen , " I said .
" I 've got to get -- I 've just been told I have a meeting with Carl .
He 's going to want to know where we stand on this .
Hard Memories has about wrapped up its casting .
We have to tell them one thing or another .
I have to tell Carl one thing or another . "
I could hear Brad counting in his head .
" Fuck , " he said , finally .
" Ten million and ten percent . "
I glanced down at my watch " Brad , it 's been a pleasure talking to you .
I hope that my client can work with you again some at some point in the future .
In the meantime , I wish you and the other Murdered Earth producers the best of success .
We 're going to miss being a part of that family . "
" You bastard , " Brad said .
" Twelve five , salary and percentage .
That 's it .
Take it or do n't . "
" And you hire her hair and makeup people . "
Brad sighed .
" Fine .
Why the hell not .
Allen 's bringing his people .
It 'll be one big party .
We 'll all put on pancake together and then get a weave . "
" Well , then , we have a deal .
Courier over the contract and we 'll start picking at it .
And remember we still need to wrangle about merchandising . "
" You know , Tom , " Brad said , " I remember when you were a nice kid . "
" I 'm still a nice kid , Brad , " I said .
" It 's just now I 've got clients that you need .
Chat with you soon . "
I hit the phone button and looked at my watch .
I just closed the biggest deal of the year to date , earned one and a quarter million for my company and myself , and still had 90 seconds before the meeting with Carl .
More than enough time to pee .
When you 're good , you 're good .

Chapter Two
I came out of the bathroom with 30 seconds left on the ticker , and started walking briskly towards the conference room .
Miranda was trotting immediately behind .
" What 's the meeting about ? " I asked , nodding to Drew Roberts as I passed his office .
" He did n't say , " Miranda said .
" Do we know who else is in the meeting ? "
" He did n't say , " Miranda said .
The second - floor conference room sits adjacent to Carl 's office , which is at the smaller end of our agency 's vaguely egg - shaped building .
The building itself has been written up in Architectural Digest , which described it as a " Four - way collision between Frank Gehry , Le Corbousier , Jay Ward and the salmonella bacteria . "
It 's unfair to the salmonella bacteria .
My office is stacked on the larger arc of the egg on the first floor , along with the offices of all the other junior agents .
After today , a second - floor , little - arc office was looking somewhat more probable in the future .
I was humming the theme to " The Jeffersons " as Miranda and I got to the door of the conference room and walked through .
In the conference room sat Carl , an aquarium , and a lot of empty chairs .
" Tom , " said Carl .
" Good of you to come . "
" Thanks , Carl , " I said , " Good of you to have the meeting . "
I then turned to the table to consider probably the most important decision of the meeting :
Where to sit .
If you sit too close to Carl , you will be pegged as an obsequious , toadying suck - up .
Which is not all that bad .
But it will also mean you run the risk of depriving a more senior agent his rightful position at the table .
Which is very bad .
Promising agency careers had been brutally derailed for such casual disregard of one 's station .
On the other hand , if you sit too far away , it 's a signal that you want to hide , that you have n't been getting your clients the good roles and the good money ; thus you 've become a drag on the agency .
Agents smell fear like sharks smell wounded sea otter pups .
Soon your clients will be poached from you .
You 'll then have nothing to do but stare at your office walls and drink antifreeze until you go blind .
I sat about halfway down the table , slightly closer to Carl than not .
What the hell .
I earned it .
" Why are you sitting so far away ? "
Carl asked .
I blinked .
" I 'm just saving space for the other folks in the meeting , " I said .
Had he heard about the Michelle Beck deal already ?
How does he do it ?
Has he tapped my phone ?
I goggled frantically at Miranda , who was standing behind me , notepad at ready .
She shot me a look that said , do n't ask me .
I 'm just here to take shorthand .
" That 's very considerate of you , Tom , " Carl said .
" But no one else is coming .
In fact , if you do n't mind , I 'd prefer it if Ms. Escalon would n't mind excusing us as well . "
This would be the point where I casually dismissed my assistant and turned suavely to Carl , ready for our executive pow - wow .
What I ended up doing was staring blankly .
Fortunately , Miranda was on the ball .
" Gentlemen , " she said , excusing herself .
On her way out , she dug the spike of her shoe into my pinky toe , and snapped me back to reality .
I stood up , looking for where to sit .
" Why do n't you sit here , " Carl said , and pointed to a chair on the far side of the table , next to the aquarium .
" Great .
Thanks , " I said .
I walked to the other side of table and sat down .
I stared at Carl .
He stared back .
He had a little smile on his face .
There are legends in the world of agents .
There 's Lew Wasserman , the agent of his day , who went over to the other side of the movie business and thrived at Universal Pictures .
There 's Mike Ovitz , who went over to the other side and exploded , humiliatingly , at Disney .
And then there 's Carl Lupo , my boss , who went over to the other side , took Century Pictures from a schlock - horror house to the biggest studio in Hollywood in just under a decade and then , at the height of his reign , came back over into agency .
No one knows why .
It scares the Hell out of everyone .
" I 'm sorry , " I said .
" What ? " Carl said .
Then he almost immediately laughed .
" Relax , Tom .
I just want to have a little chat .
It 's been a while since we 've talked . "
The last time Carl and I had talked directly to each other in a non-meeting setting was three years earlier .
I had just graduated from the mailroom to the agency floor , where I shared a pod with another mailroom escapee .
My client list was a former teen idol , then in his 30s and a semi-regular at intervention sessions , and a cute but brainless 22 - year old UCLA cheerleader named Shelly Beckwith .
Carl had dropped by , shook hands with me and my podmate , and blathered pleasantries with us for exactly two minutes and thirty seconds before moving on to the next pod to do the same thing .
Since then , the former teen idol strangled in his own saliva , my podmate imploded from stress and left the agency to become a Buddhist monk in Big Bear , Shelly Beckwith became Michelle Beck and got lucky with two hits in a row , and I got an office .
It 's a strange world .
" How are things going with Michelle Beck 's negotiations ? "
Carl asked .
" They 're done , actually , " I said .
" We 're getting twelve five , cash and percentages , and that 's before merchandising . "
" That 's good to hear , " Carl said .
" Davis thought you'd hit a wall at about $ 8.5 million , you know .
I told him you'd top that by at least three and a half .
You beat the point spread by a half million dollars . "
" Always happy to overachieve , Carl . "
" Yes , well , Brad 's no good at bargaining anyway .
I stuck him with Allen Green , of all people , for 20 million .
How that film is ever going to make a profit now is really beyond me . "
I chose not to say anything at this point .
" Oh , well , not our problem , I suppose , " Carl said .
" Tell me , Tom .
Do you like science fiction ? "
" Science fiction ? " I said .
" Sure .
Star Wars and Star Trek , mostly , same as everyone .
As a kid I remember begging my mother to let me stay up and watch ' Battlestar Galactica ' .
And there was a period when I was 14 when I read just about every Robert Heinlein book I could get my hands on .
It 's been a while since I 've really read any , though .
I watched Murdered Earth once , at the premiere .
I think that 's killed the genre for me for a while . "
" Which do you like better , movies with evil aliens , or movies with good aliens ? "
" I do n't know , " I said .
" I have n't really ever given it much thought . "
" Please do so now , " Carl said .
" Indulge me , if you do n't mind . "
Carl could have said Please disembowel yourself and sauté your intestines with mushrooms .
Indulge me , if you do n't mind and anyone in the agency would have done it .
It 's disgusting what sycophancy can do .
" I guess if I had to make the choice , I 'd go with the evil aliens , " I said .
" They just make for better films .
Put in a bad alien and you get the Alien films , Independence Day , Predator , Stargate , Starship Troopers .
Good aliens get you * Batteries Not Included .
No contest . "
" Well , " Carl said , " There is E.T. And Close Encounters . "
" I 'll give you E.T. , " I said .
" But I do n't buy Close Encounters .
Those aliens were cute , sure , but that does n't mean they were n't evil .
Once they got out of the solar system , Richard Dreyfus was probably penned up like a veal .
Anyway , no one really knows what 's going on in that movie .
Spielberg must have been downing peyote frosties when he thought that one up . "
" The Star Trek movies have good aliens .
So do the Star Wars movies . "
" The Star Trek movies have bad aliens too , like the Klingons and those guys with the wires in their heads . "
" The Borg , " Carl said .
" Right , " I said .
" And in Star Wars , no one was from Earth , so everyone , technically , was an alien . "
" Interesting , " Carl said .
He was steepling his fingers together .
Apparently the revelation that everyone in Star Wars had a passport from some other planet had transfixed him like a particularly troublesome Zen koan .
" If you do n't mind me asking , Carl , " I said , " Why are we talking about this ?
Are we putting together a package for a science fiction movie ?
Other than Earth Resurrected , I mean . "
" Not exactly , " Carl said , unsteepling his fingers , and placing them , flat out , on the desk .
" I was having a discussion with a friend of mine about this and I wanted to get another opinion on it .
Your opinion on the matter is like his , by the way .
He 's pretty much of the opinion that people are more comfortable with aliens as a hostile ' other ' rather than a group that would have friendly intentions . "
" Well , I do n't think most people really think of aliens one way or the other , " I said .
" I mean , we 're talking about movies , here .
As much as I like the movies , it 's not the same time thing . "
" Really ? "
The fingersteeple was suddenly back .
" So if real aliens dropped from the sky , people might accept that they'd be friendly ? "
I was back to staring again .
I remembered having a conversation like this , once before in my life .
The difference was that that conversation was back in my deeply stoned college freshman days , in a room strung with Christmas lights and tin foil , lying on a beanbag .
The conversation I was having now was with one of the few men on the planet who could have the President of the United States return his call .
Within ten minutes ( They roomed together at Yale ) .
Having this conversation with Carl was profoundly incongruous , right up there with listening to your grandfather talk about the merits of the hottest new sports kayak .
" Maybe , " I ventured .
When in doubt , equivocate .
" Hmmmm . " Carl said .
" So , Tom .
Tell me about your clients . "
I have a little man in the back of my brain .
He likes to panic in situations like these .
He was looking around nervously .
I kicked him back into his hole and started down the list .
First and foremost , obviously , was Michelle : beautiful , in demand , and not nearly smart enough to realize the dumbest thing she could at this point in her life is not take the money and run .
I blamed myself .
Next up was Elliot Young , hunky young star of the ABC's " Pacific Rim " .
" Pacific Rim " was second in its Wednesday 9 PM time slot and 63rd overall for the year .
But thanks to Elliot 's tight , volleyball - player ass and ABC 's willingness to have him drop his shorts to solve crime at least once per episode , it was cleaning up in the 18 - 34 female viewers category .
ABC was selling a lot of ad time to yeast infection treatments and feminine products with " wings " .
Everyone was happy .
Elliot 's looking to expand into film , but then , of course , who is n't .
Rashaad Creek , urban comic , originally from the mean streets of Marin County , where they 'll busta cap in your ass for serving red wine with fish .
Rashaad was n't nearly as neurotic as most comedians , which means on his own he 's generally not as funny .
Nevertheless , thanks to some nice packaging work , we 'd sold his pilot " Workin ' Out ! " to UPN .
Rashaad 's budding career was watched over like a hawk by his overbearing manager , who also happened to be his mother .
We pause for a shudder here .
The unfortunately - named Tea Reader ( pronounced tee - a ) , singer - turned - actress that I inherited from my old podmate after his forebrain sucked inward .
Tea , from what I can figure , contributed a good half of his stress -- notoriously difficult and given to tantrums far out of proportion to her track record ( Three singles from one album , peaking at # 9 , # 13 and # 24 , respectively , a second female lead in a Pauly Shore flick , and a series of ads for Mentos ) .
She was just this side ( she insisted ) of 30 , which made her a perfect candidate to host her own talk show or infomercial .
Tea called about once a week and threatened to get other representation .
I wish .
Tony Baltz , a character actor who was nominated for a Best Supporting Oscar a decade ago , and had since refused to consider anything that 's not a lead role .
Which was a shame , as the romantic lead market for 50 - something short , bald guys was pretty much already sewn up by Danny DeVito and Dennis Franz .
We managed to get him the occasional " Lifetime " movie .
The rest of my clients were a collection of has - beens , never - weres , near - misses and not - there - yets , the sorts of folks that fill out the bottom half of every junior agent 's dance card .
Someone has to play the second spear - carrier on the left , and someone has to represent them .
Be that as it may , going over the list with Carl , I realized that if it was n't for the presence of Michelle , my client roster was of the sort that makes for a lifetime of junior agenthood .
I decided not to bring it up .
" So , to recap , " Carl said , after I had finished , " One superstar , two average - to - mediocres , two marginals and a bunch of filler . "
I thought about trying to sweeten up that assessment , but then realized there was n't a point .
I shrugged .
" I suppose so , Carl .
It 's no worse than any other junior agent 's client list here . "
" Oh , no , I was n't criticizing , " Carl said .
" You 're a good agent , Tom .
You look out for your people and you get them work -- and , as today proves , you can get them what they 're worth and then some .
You 're a sharp kid .
You 're going to do well in this business . "
" Thanks , Carl , " I said .
" Sure , " he said .
He pushed back his chair a bit and plopped his legs on the table .
" Tom , how many of your clients do you think you can afford to lose ? "
" What ? "
" How many can you lose ? "
Carl waved his hand .
" You know , farm out to other agents , drop entirely , whatever . "
The little man in my head had escaped from his hole and was running around frantically , as if on fire .
" None ! " I said .
" I mean , with all due respect , Carl , I can't lose any of them .
It 's not fair to them , for one thing , but for another thing , I need them .
Michelle 's doing well now , but believe me , that 's not going to last forever .
You ca n't ask me to cut myself off at the knees . "
I pushed back slightly from the table .
" Jesus , Carl , " I said .
" What 's going on here ?
First the science fiction , now with my clients --
None of this making much sense to me at the moment .
I 'm getting a little nervous , here .
If you 've got some bad news for me , stop twisting me and just get to it . "
Carl stared at me for the fifteen longest seconds in my life .
Then he put his feet down , and moved his chair closer to me .
" You 're right , Tom " he said .
" I 'm not handling this very well .
I apologize .
Let me try this again . "
He closed his eyes , took a breath , and looked straight at me .
I thought my spine was going to liquefy .
" Tom , " he said , " I have a client .
It 's a very important client , Tom , probably the most important client we as an agency will ever have .
At least I can't imagine any other client being more important than this one .
This client feels that he has a very serious image problem , and I 'd have to say that I agree with him there .
He has a special project that he wants to put together , something that needs the most delicate handling imaginable .
" I need someone to help me get this project off the ground , someone that I can trust .
Someone who can handle the job for me without my constant supervision , and who can keep his ego in check for the sake of the project .
" I 'm hoping you 'll be that someone for me , Tom .
If you say no , it wo n't affect your role at the agency in the slightest -- you can walk out of this office and this meeting that we 've had simply wo n't have happened .
But if you do say yes , it means you 're committed , whatever it takes , for as long as it takes .
Will you help me ? "
The little man in my head was now pounding on the backsides of my eyeballs .
Say NO , the little man was saying .
Say no and then let 's go to TGI Fridays and get really , really drunk .
" Sure , " I said .
The little man in my head started weeping openly .
Carl reached over , covered my hand like it was his computer mouse , and shook it vigorously .
" I knew I could count on you , " he said .
" Thanks .
I think you 're going to enjoy this . "
" I hope so , " I said .
" I 'm in for the long haul .
So who is the client ?
Is it Tony ? " Antonio Marantz had been caught fondling a sixteen - year - old extra on the set of the latest Morocco Joe film .
It was a bad situation made worse by the fact that the sixteen - year - old that People 's " Most Eligible Bachelor " was fooling around with happened to be a boy , and the son of the director .
After the director 's fingers were pried from Tony 's throat , everything was hushed up .
The director got a million dollar raise .
The boy got a Director 's Guild " internship " on the Admiral Cook biopic that was filming in Greenland for the next six months .
Tony got a stern lecture about the effect that cavorting with underage boys would have on the asking price of his next role .
The crew got lesser but still fairly rich favors .
Everyone stayed bought ;
It did n't even make the gossip column of Buzz .
But you never know .
These things spring leaks .
" No , it 's not Tony , " Carl said .
" Our client is here . "
" In the building ? "
" No , " Carl said , tapping the aquarium that was between us .
" Here . "
" I 'm not following you , Carl , " I said .
" You 're talking about an aquarium . "
" Look in the aquarium , " Carl said .
For the first time since I entered the room , I took a good look at the aquarium .
It was rectangular and neither especially big or small -- about the size of the usual aquarium you 'd see in any home .
The only thing notable about it was the absence of fish , rocks , bubbling filters or little plastic treasure chests .
It was filled entirely with a liquid that was clear but slightly cloudy , as if the aquarium water had n't been changed in about a month .
I stood up , looked over the top of the aquarium , and got a closer look .
And smell .
I looked over the aquarium at him .
" What is this , tuna Jell - O ? "
" Not exactly , " Carl said , and then addressed the aquarium .
" Joshua , please say hello to Tom . "
The stuff in the aquarium vibrated .
" Hi , Tom , " the aquarium gunk said .
" It 's nice to meet you . "

Chapter Three
" How do you do that ? " I asked Carl .
" Do what ? "
Carl asked .
" Make it speak , " I said .
" That 's a really neat trick . "
" I 'm not making it speak , Tom . "
Carl said .
" No , I know that .
I realize it's not a ventriloquist thing , " I said .
" What I 'm asking is , how does sound come out of it at all .
Jell - O does n't strike me as the most efficient medium for sound . "
" I 'm not really sure about the physics of it , Tom , " Carl said .
" I 'm an agent , not a scientist . "
" This is very cool technology , " I said , touching the surface of the gunk .
It was sticky , and resisted my fingertips a little .
" I mean , I 'm not going to rush out and buy Jell - O speakers , but it 's still very cool .
What is it ?
Something from a science fiction movie ?
Is our client doing a film about gelatinous aliens or something ? "
" Tom , " Carl said .
" It 's not about a movie .
That , " he pointed to the aquarium , " is our client . "
I stopped playing around with the gunk and looked over at Carl .
" I 'm not following you , " I said .
" It 's alive , Tom , " Carl said .
The stuff wriggled slightly under my fingers .
I pulled them back so quickly I felt a seam on my suit jacket rip .
An inside seam .
Near the shoulder .
I had paid $ 400 for the jacket , and it let me down in the first moment of crisis .
I focused all my mental energy on considering that jacket seam , because the only other thing to think about at the moment was that thing in the tank .
The jacket seam , that I could handle .
Finally , after a few minutes , the words came , something that , I think , covered the enormity of the situation and what I was experiencing in my head .
" Holy shit , " I said .
" That 's a new one on me , " said the aquarium gunk .
" It 's just an expression , " Carl said .
" Holy Christ on a pony , " I said .
" So 's that , " Carl noted .
" Ah , " said the gunk .
" Listen , do you mind if I get out of this box now ?
I 've been it all day .
The right angles are killing me . "
" Please , " Carl said .
Thank you , " said the gunk .
A tendril formed off the surface of the gunk and arched towards the conference table , touching down close to the center of the table .
The tendril wobbled slightly for a second , then thickened tremendously as the gunk transferred itself out of the aquarium through the tendril .
When the transfer was over the tendril reabsorbed into the main body , which now sat , globular , on the conference table .
" That 's much better , " the gunk said .
" Carl , " I said .
I was keeping my distance from the gunk .
" You 'd really better catch me up on what 's going on here . "
Carl had put his feet back on the table .
They rested not too far off from where the gunk was piled .
That seemed a bad idea to me .
" Do you want the long or short version ? "
He asked .
" Give me the short version for now , if you do n't mind , " I said .
" Fine , " he said .
" Tom , have a seat , please .
I promise Joshua wo n't leap on you and suck out your brains . "
" I won't , " the gunk that was apparently called Joshua agreed .
" I 'm a good alien , not like those bad aliens that make for such good movies .
Please , Tom , sit down . "
I did n't know which was more fundamentally disturbing : that Jell - O was talking to me , that it had a sense of humor , or that it had better manners than I did .
My body sat down in my seat ; the man in my brain readied himself for a sprint to the door .
" Thank you , " Carl said .
" Here 's the short version : About four months ago , the Yherajk , of which my friend Joshua is a member of , contacted me .
The Yherajk have been watching us here on Earth for a while , and they decided recently that after several years of observation , it was time to make themselves known to humanity .
But they have concerns . "
" We look like snot , " Joshua said .
" And we smell like dead fish . "
Carl nodded in Joshua 's direction .
" The Yherajk are worried that their physical appearance will present problems . "
" We have seen The Blob , and it is us , " Joshua intoned .
Another nod from Carl .
" The Yherajk have decided that before they can appear to humanity , some arrangements have to be made -- a way has to be made for them not to appear so ugly from the outset . "
" We need an agent to get us the role of the friendly aliens , " Joshua said .
" That 's the short version , " Carl said .
I sat there for a second , trying to process the information .
" Can I ask a question ? " I said .
" Shoot , " said Joshua .
I looked at Joshua and for a moment I was frozen .
I did n't know what part of it to address .
It all looked the same .
I dealt with it by looking straight at its center .
" Dumb question first :
Why did n't you just drop on the lawn of the White House ?
I mean , in the movies , that 's pretty much how it was done . "
" We thought about it , " Joshua said .
" Then we caught the Presidential debates .
The people you folks elect are sort of scary .
And you Americans are the folks that do it the best on this entire planet .
Besides , your president only speaks for Americans .
American movies speak for your world .
Who has n't seen Wizard of Oz ?
Or Jaws ?
Or Star Wars ?
We 've seen them , and we 're not even from this planet . "
Joshua sprouted a tendril and tapped the table .
" If you want to introduce yourself to the planet , this is the place to start . "
" Okay , " I said .
I looked over at Carl .
" The .... Earjack --"
" Yherajk , " Carl said , pronouncing it yee - heer - aahg - k .
" It 's not our real name , " Joshua said , " but you could n't pronounce what we 're actually called . "
" Why not ? " I asked .
" Well , for one thing , it 's a smell , " Joshua said .
" Would you like to smell it ? "
I glanced at Carl .
He shrugged .
" Sure , " I said .
The room filled with a stench that resembled the offspring of a rotted sneaker and Velveeta .
I gagged involuntarily .
" God , that 's horrible , " I said , and immediately regretted it .
" I 'm very sorry , " I said .
" That was probably the first ever insult to an extraterrestrial .
I apologize . "
" No offense taken , " Joshua said , mildly .
" You should come to a Yherajk get - together .
It 's like a convention of farts . "
" I believe there was a question at the beginning of all this , " Carl said .
" Right , " I said , and looked back to Carl .
" How many people know about the Yherajk ? "
" Including you and me ? " Carl said .
" Yes , " I said .
" Two , " Carl said .
" Well , and a couple thousand Yherajk orbiting the planet .
But among humans , it 's just you and me . "
" Wow , " I said .
" It 's not that hard to believe , " Joshua said .
" If you run out of here and say that you 've just met an alien that looks like gelatin and smells like a cat in heat , who 's going to believe you ?
All the really believable aliens have spines . "
I ignored this .
" Carl , why me ? "
Carl tilted his head at me , and regarded me like a favored child .
Which , perhaps , I was .
" What do you mean ? " he asked .
" I mean , I 'm flattered that you picked me to help you to do .... "
I waved my hands around , " whatever it is that we 're going to be doing here .
But I do n't know why you picked me . "
" Well , it 's like I said , " Carl said .
" I need someone who 's smart and that I can trust . "
" I appreciate that , " I said .
" But Carl , you do n't even know me .
I 've worked here for five years , and every other time we 've spoken , it was in meetings , about our clients and how we were going to package them .
And that was n't that often . "
" Do you feel neglected ? " Carl asked .
" I would n't have pegged you for that . "
" No , that 's not it , " I said .
" It 's never bothered me .
That 's not what I mean .
What I mean is that I do n't know why you feel you can trust me , or why you think I 'm smart .
You can , and I am , but I would n't have thought I 'd be an obvious choice .
I 'm surprised you even thought of me . "
Carl smirked , looked off for a second , as if communicating to an unseen audience , and then turned back to me .
" Tom , " he said , " give me some credit for knowing something about the people who I employ . "
I straightened up slightly .
" I did n't mean to offend you , Carl . "
" You have n't , " he said .
" My point here is simply that I 've been aware of you and your work for this company .
Your works speaks quite a bit as to the person you are , and as for the rest of it ... " he shrugged .
" Sometimes you take a chance . "
" Thanks , " I said .
" Also , to be blunt , " Carl continued , " you 're just a junior agent here .
You 're flying under the radar .
If any of the senior agents suddenly divested himself of his clients and started sneaking around , it would be noticed .
There would be gossip .
Infighting .
Stories in Variety and the Times .
No one 's going to notice or care if you do the same thing . "
It was my turn to smirk .
" Well , my mother might be concerned . "
" Does she write for the Times ? " Carl said .
" I do n't think so , " I said .
" She lives in Arizona . "
" Well , then , " Carl said .
" That 's fine with me . "
" I 'm still confused as to why you need me , " I said .
" Certainly you do n't need me to put something together . "
" But I do , " Carl said .
" Because I can 't . "
" Tom , " Joshua said , " If it would throw the company in turmoil if one of the senior agents here dropped what they 're doing to start working on a secret project , how much more suspicious is it going to look if Carl did it ? "
" I can't even take a vacation without someone here attempting a palace coup , " Carl said .
" There 's no way I 'm going to be able to stop running this place to look after this .
No , someone else has to deal with this thing .
You 've got the job . "
" Carl , I do n't even know what the job is , " I said .
" Make me beautiful , " Joshua said .
" I 'm ready for my closeup , Mr. DeMille . "
" The Job , " Carl said , implying the capital " J " with his voice , " Is to find some way to prepare the planet for the presence of the Yherajk .
They 're ready to show themselves to humanity , Tom .
You have to make humanity ready for them . "
The words hung out there in the air for a minute , not unlike , I suppose , the fragrance of a Yherajk conversation -- invisible , but very hard to ignore .
" I 'm just guessing here , " Joshua said , " But I 'm thinking this is probably where you say ' Holy shit ' again , Tom . "

Chapter Four
Miranda was being monopolized by Ben Fleck , another junior agent , when I returned .
She glanced at me pointedly as I walked by .
The glance had a double meaning .
The first was whatthe Hell happened in there ?
The second was Rescue me .
Ben was a first class jerk who had been trying for 18 months to get into Miranda 's pants ; it would have constituted sexual harassment except that Ben was so obviously inept at it .
" Miranda , " I said , " Could you please come to my office ? "
" Hey , " Ben said .
" I 'm discussing a client with Miranda at the moment . "
" That client is in your pants , Ben , " I said .
" And he 's never going to get the job .
Miranda ? "
I held the door open for her as she took her notepad and walked by me into my office .
" Thank you , " she said , as I closed the door behind us .
" Though you should n't be so rough on Ben .
He 's sort of sweet , in his own lecherous , oafish way . "
" Nonsense , " I said .
" I 'm not going to let him get away with anything I 'm not allowed to get away with . "
" But Tom , " Miranda said .
" you 're neither lecherous nor oafish . "
" Thanks , Miranda , " I said , and leaned against my desk .
" I 'll put that on my gravestone .
' Here lies Thomas Stein .
He was neither lecherous nor oafish . ' "
" Enough chitchat , " Miranda said .
" Do you still have a job , or are you just putting on a brave face for your devoted staff ? "
" Miranda , did anyone pay attention to where we were going when we went to the meeting ? "
Miranda sat in the chair in front of my desk and thought for a moment .
" Not that I could tell .
You nodded to Drew Roberts as we walked past him , but do n't think he noticed .
You 're a junior agent .
You do n't rate a nod back . "
" Good , " I said .
" Did anyone ask where I was ? "
" In the office ?
No. Michelle called again , " Miranda crossed her eyes slightly at the word Michelle , indicating in her own subtle way that she believed Michelle to be less intelligent than the average protozoan , " but I just told her you were in a meeting .
Other than that , my attention was monopolized by Ben , who loathes you and would not ask about you even if he could get a promotion out of it .
Why ? "
" If anyone asks , I was just out to get a bagel , okay ? "
" You 're killing me , " Miranda said .
" I do n't normally threaten my bosses , but if you do n't tell me what happened in there , I may have to hurt you . "
" I can 't , Miranda .
You know if I could tell anyone , I could tell you . "
I gave her my best I 'm - utterly - helpless look .
" I just can't .
Just trust me for now , please , and just forget that meeting ever took place ? "
Miranda looked at me for a minute .
" Okay , Tom , " she said , finally .
" But if we 're not going to talk about the meeting that did n't take place , why did you call me in here ? "
" I need you to get my files on everyone I represent .
Also , give me the names of the latest agents up from the mailroom , and their client lists , if you can . "
Miranda jotted on her notepad .
" All right , " she said .
" Anything in particular I should look for in the new agents ? "
" I want someone who is so new that he still could do his mail route with his eyes closed .
Someone who does n't know anything .
Me , about three years ago . "
" Young and naive .
Got it , Tom .
Actually , I know just the person . "
" Great .
Give me about an hour with my files and then have them come for a visit . "
" Fine .
Anything else ? "
" Yes .
I 'm going to need one of those watercooler bottles .
And a dolly . "
Miranda looked up from her notepad .
" A watercooler bottle ? "
" Yeah .
One of those Arrowhead Water bottles .
The five gallon ones . "
" And a dolly . "
" If you can find one .
They have them in the mailroom , I think .
You can have the new agent retrieve it . "
I could see Miranda debating with herself whether or not she wanted to ask what the water bottle was for .
She finally decided against it .
What a pro .
" Do you want the water bottle empty or full ? "
" Does n't matter , " I said .
" It does to me , " she said .
" I have to lug the damn thing to your office . "
" Empty , please . "
She stopped writing .
" Okay , " she said .
" You 'll have your files in just a minute . "
She stood up and walked over the two steps to where I was .
I stopped leaning on the desk and stood up .
" Tom , " she said , " You can trust me ; I 'll never speak of that meeting in front of anyone .
But whatever happened in that meeting , congratulations . "
She reached over and tousled my hair .
It was an old - fashioned and matronly move from someone who was my assistant , and a year younger than I was .
It made me grin like an idiot .
*****
Miranda dropped the files on my desk .
It was now time to play everybody 's favorite game : Ditch the clients .
" This thing is going to take up all of your time from now on , " Carl had warned , right after I had signed up for the ride .
" You 're going to have to formulate a plan and execute it .
You 're going to have to be an aide to Joshua , as well .
Which reminds me : he needs to stay at your place . "
" What ? " I said .
Visions of slug slime coating my upholstery leapt , unbidden , into my mind .
" Tom , " Joshua said , " it 's not exactly an easy commute between here and the ship . "
" We can work out the details later , " Carl said , getting back on track .
" But what you need to do now , Tom , is go through your client list and as quietly as possible , offload as many as you can .
Joshua is your full - time job now . "
I stared at the files and had a weird tingling in my head .
On one hand , this was an agent 's dream -- get rid of the truly annoying clients !
Cut the dead weight !
Unload the ballast !
Every agent who was not running an agency had clients they 'd rather be without -- and here I was being told to eject them .
On the other hand , as an agent , you 're only as good as your client list .
Better bad clients than none at all .
I was understanding intellectually that my new " client " was an opportunity that comes along -- well , that 's never come along before , now that I thought of it .
Emotionally , however , it still felt like I was taking the ascending 747 that was my agentorial career and aiming it into the Pacific , while all the passengers , my clients , were screaming in the coach seats , their little emergency plastic airmasks waving in the turbulence .
Enough thinking , I decided .
I grabbed the first file .
Tony Baltz .
Gone .
He was on his way down anyway , since he was too proud to take the roles that had made him famous in the first place .
Rashaad Creek .
Keep .
I could work through his mother , who was doing most of the heavy lifting in that partnership , anyway .
The unsettling Oedipal overtones to Rashaad 's situation had always disturbed me , but now I could finally use them to my advantage .
Elliot Young .
Keep .
Elliot , bless his heart , was not the brightest of studs .
I could sit down with him one afternoon and convince him that by buckling down on the series for a season , it would make the transition to films much more profitable in the long run .
Who , knows , it might even be the truth .
Tea Reader .
Gone .
Thank the Lord almighty .
Michelle Beck .
Keep .
Of course .
Michelle Beck was my cover : when a client can rake in twelve million per film , an agent can't be faulted for wanting to spend more time concentrating on that client .
Also , flying under the radar or not , dropping Michelle after today 's paycheck would be noticed by someone .
Michelle and I were bound together for life , or until she pulled a hissy fit and got new representation .
If I did n't have her , I would be , as my father liked to say , walking through a thick shag carpet of shit .
The ambivalence I felt about this fact was staggering in its depth .
The undercard folks were all toast .
It did n't really matter who agented them , anyway .
I was finishing up my client triage when Miranda buzzed me .
" Mr. Stein , " she said .
I could count the times she called me Mr. Stein on one hand , without having to use my thumb or index finger .
" Amanda Hewson is here . "
" Accompany her in , please , Ms. Escalon , " I called Miranda Ms. Escalon even less than she called me Mr. Stein .
Miranda walked in , followed by a gawky blonde who looked like she was n't old enough to see " R " - rated films without accompaniment .
Amanda Hewson had graduated from the mailroom just over a month before .
Her two clients were a former Mexican soap opera star who wanted to make it big in Hollywood , but did n't want to learn the English language , and an actor who administered first aid to her after she fainted on mile 4 of the LA Marathon .
She represented him , apparently , largely out of gratitude .
She was perfect .
" Amanda , " I said , motioning to the chair in front of my desk .
" Please sit down . "
She did .
I regarded her the same way Carl regarded me earlier today .
It 's fair ; the distance , careerwise , was not dissimilar .
Amanda was looking around .
" Nice office , " she said .
My office is a dump .
" It is , is n't it ? " I said .
" Amanda , do you know why I asked you here ? "
" Not really , " Amanda confessed .
" Ms. Escalon " -- Unseen by Amanda , Miranda crossed her eyes ; she did n't appear to cotton to all this formalness -- " said that it was important but did n't say what it was . "
I did some more regarding .
It was making Amanda nervous , she looked behind her briefly to see if I was actually looking at something behind her , then turned back , tittered nervously .
Her hands , restless in her lap , spasmed lightly .
I looked at Miranda .
" You think she 's the one ? " I asked .
Now it was Miranda 's turn to regard Amanda .
I have to admit , she did a much scarier regarding .
Amanda looked about to wet her pants .
" I think so , " Miranda said .
" At least , she 's much better than the other possibles . "
I had no idea what Miranda was talking about .
Then again , she did n't know what I was talking about either .
We were making this up as we went along .
" So , Amanda , " I said .
" Where 'd you go to school ? "
" UCLA , " she said .
" In Westwood , " she added .
After she said that I could see the thought travel through her head : Moron !
We 're in LA !
He KNOWS where UCLA is !
God !
I 'm an idiot !
Panic can be truly endearing when it 's done right .
" Really , " I said .
" I 'm a Bruin myself .
How 's the high - speed life of an agent treating you these days ? "
" Well , really well , " she said , with obvious fervor .
" I mean , I 'm just getting started , so it 's a little rough .
I think it 'll be a few more months before I really get my legs . "
She smiled brightly .
She was so new that she did n't realize that admitting weakness was a mortal sin among agents .
I wondered how she got past the screening process .
Beside me , I could feel waves of pity emanate from Miranda .
Now I knew why she had suggested Amanda -- she was trying to keep this clearly non-cynical young woman from having the stuffing kicked out of her by her more vicious compatriots .
" Well , I hope your legs are ready now , Amanda , " I said .
" The officers of this corporation " -- I always thought that phrase sounded dramatic , and I was right -- " have instructed me to inaugurate a pilot mentor project for our newest agents , a sort of helping hand to get them up to speed more quickly .
Now , I have to emphasize that this is just a pilot program , and highly experimental .
In fact , it 's a secret --"
Amanda 's eyes actually widened .
If I were just ten percent less jaded , I think I might have fallen in love .
" -- so you 'll have to keep it that way .
It 's officially unofficial .
Understand ? "
" Sure , Mr. Stein . "
" Call me Tom , " I said .
" Amanda , what do you think of Tea Reader ? "
Her eyes got even wider .
Make that five percent less jaded .
Two hours and a Starbucks latte each later , the Officially Unofficial Mentor Project was underway .
Under my " supervision , " Amanda would take over the day - to - day representation needs of Tea Reader , Tony Baltz , and my undercard clients .
For the first month , Amanda would make detailed weekly reports on " our " clients , which I would read and comment on .
That would decrease to twice monthly the second month , and monthly thereafter .
During this time , any money made from representing these clients would be split between mentor and student .
After six months , pending mentor approval , Amanda could represent up to six of these clients full - time , with all commissions and fees going to her from that point forward .
To myself , I figured that any clients she did n't want to keep after six months I would drop in any event .
Amanda was happy because even with a reduced commission rate , she stood to make far more money over the next six months than she could have off her own clients , and would get an automatically expanded client list at the end of it .
Plus , of course , my invaluable mentoring services .
I was happy because I offloaded my clients .
The only one who might not be entirely happy with it was Miranda , because she knew that the reports I was supposed to read and comment on were actually going to be read and commented on by her .
But she did n't say anything about it .
I was going to have to get her raise soon .
Amanda went of in a haze of blissfulness and promises to " get right on it . "
She was like a Mouseketeer on " Let 's Represent Someone " day .
I could almost see her skip to her pod .
I hoped her first experience with Tea Reader would not send her too much into shock .
" That was a dirty trick , " Miranda said to me .
" What do you mean ? " I said .
" Look at her .
What are her chances of getting a decent client list on her own ? "
" Not to her , " Miranda said .
" To me .
Now I 'm going to have to add babysitting to my list of things to do . "
" She 'll be fine , " I said .
" And anyway , I thought you liked her . "
" I do like her , " Miranda said .
" And she will be fine .
Eventually . "
She put her face closer to mine .
" But in the short term , I might as well be a crossing guard , for all the hand - holding I 'm going to do .
Now .
I 'm off to get your waterbottle . "
She walked out of the office .
I was going to have to get her a raise very soon .
*****
I knocked on the conference room door .
It was unoccupied .
I entered the conference room with the water bottle and the dolly , closed the door , locked it behind me .
" You have got to be kidding , " Joshua said .
Joshua had returned back to the aquarium and had stayed in the conference room after our meeting was done .
My job had been to find a unobtrusive way to get him from the conference room to my place .
Carl would n't tell me how he had gotten Joshua into the building unnoticed , and he was n't giving me any tips on how to get him out .
Think of it as your first challenge , he said .
Were I palming off the first known extraterrestrial on a subordinate to take care of , I think I 'd be a little more concerned .
" We give you three hours to come up with something , and this is the best you can do , " Joshua said .
" I 'm not scared yet , but I 'm getting there . "
" I 'm sorry , " I said .
" I had to improvise . "
I wheeled the bottle over and sat it next to the tank .
I had figured that a five - gallon water bottle would be big enough to fit Joshua in .
Now I was n't so sure .
Neither was he .
He extended a tendril out of the aquarium and sent it down into the bottle and waved it around , as if to check it for roominess .
" How long will it take to get to your place ? " he said .
" Probably an hour , maybe more , " I said .
" I live in La Canada .
The 405 will be jammed up , but once we get over to the 210 , it should be pretty quick .
Is it going to be a problem ? "
" Not at all , " Joshua said .
" Who does n't enjoy being crammed into a five - gallon plastic bottle for an hour ? "
" You do n't have to stay in the bottle once we get to the car , " I said .
" Once we 're out of here , you can spread out . "
This wrinkle in the plan was as new to me as it was to him .
I had assumed he'd stay in the bottle the whole trip .
But my car upholstery was a small price to pay for interplanetary peace .
I 'd just have to remember to get one of those little pine tree air fresheners .
" Thanks , but no thanks , " Joshua said .
" The conversation where you try to explain to a highway patrolman why you have 40 pounds of gelatin in your passenger seat is one I think we'd both rather avoid . "
I laughed .
" I 'm sorry , " I said .
" I 'm sort of amazed you know what a highway patrolman is . "
" Why ? " Joshua said .
" You 've been beaming ' CHiPs ' into space for decades . "
He wiggled his tendril again , and then sighed .
He must have picked that up purely as a sonic affectation because he had no lungs from which to exhale .
" All right , here I go , " he said , and started putting himself into the bottle .
He came dangerously close to filling up the bottle .
In the last few seconds , a thought popped into my skull : I 'm going to need another bottle .
It did n't occur to me to question the logic of that thought .
He was gelatinous , he should be able to divide up .
It became academic when he topped out about three millimeters from the top of the mouth of the bottle .
" Comfortable ? " I asked .
" Remind me to stuff you into a medium - sized suitcase and ask you that same question , " Joshua said .
His voice was diminished and tinny , no doubt due to the relatively tiny amount of surface area he had to vibrate .
" Sorry , " I said .
" Listen , do you need this open ?
I 'm thinking it might be better if I put the top back on this thing . "
" Are you out of your mind ? " Joshua said .
" Keep it open . "
" Okay , " I said .
" I did n't know .
I suppose you need to breathe . "
" It 's not that , " Joshua said .
" I 'm claustrophobic . "
" Really ? "
" Look , " Joshua said .
" Just because I come from a highly advanced alien species does n't mean I can't be intensely neurotic .
Can we go now ?
I already feel like I want to scream . "
I hiked the dolly up on its wheels , wheeled over to the door , unlocked it , and headed out into the hallway .
It was still early enough in the day that the office was still busy .
I was worried that someone might ask me why I was wheeling a five - gallon water bottle around until I remembered that I was on the second floor , the land of senior agents .
A senior agent would naturally assume it was my job to wheel water bottles around .
I was probably safe until I hit the lobby .
Which is in fact where I got noticed .
As I passed the receptionist 's desk on the way to the parking lot , some guy at the desk turned around .
" Tom Stein ? " he asked .
The Just Keep Moving command left my brain a tenth of a second after the Look Around reflex kicked in .
By then , of course , it was too late ; I had already stopped and looked back .
" Yes ? "
The man jogged the short distance over and extended his hand .
" Glad I caught you , " he said , as we shook .
" Your assistant said you had already left . "
" I had , " I said .
" I just had to stop elsewhere and pick something up . "
" I can see that , " he said , glancing down at the waterbottle .
" I guess you 've gone past office supplies . "
" Who are you ? " I asked .
" I 'm sorry , " he said .
" Jim Van Doren .
I write for The Biz . "
The Biz was a weekly bit of libel written in a snide , knowing sort of tone that implied the folks who slapped together The Biz were just coming from lunch with movie company heads , who could n't wait to slip them the latest gossip .
Neither I nor anyone I knew knew anyone who had ever actually spoken to anyone at the magazine .
No one knew how the magazine got written .
No one knew anyone who actually would pay to read it .
Van Doren himself was about my age , blond and balding , sort of pudgy .
He looked like what happened to former USC frat boys about three months after they realize that their college days were never , ever coming back .
" Van Doren , " I said .
" No relation to Charles , I assume . "
" The guy from Quiz Show ?
I wish , " Van Doren said .
" His dad won a Pulitzer Prize , you know .
Would n't mind getting one of those myself . "
" You 'd probably have to work for a magazine that did n't devote six pages to an illustrated article about porno pictures on the Internet , " I said .
" You remember , the one where big star 's heads were cut and pasted on to pictures of women having sex with dogs and glass bottles ?
The one that just about every movie studio in the city sued you over . "
" I did n't have anything to do with that story , " he said .
" That 's good , " I said .
" Michelle Beck is my client .
She was rather unamused by the picture that had her taking it up the back door from George Clooney while eating out Gwenyth Paltrow .
As her agent , I 'd be required to break your nose on her behalf .
Of course , I 'd take my ten percent , too . "
I started walking towards the lobby door .
Van Doren , who was not taking the hint , followed .
" Actually , Tom , I knew you were Michelle Beck 's agent .
It 's sort of why I came here .
Heard that you got her twelve and a half for Earth Resurrected .
That 's not bad . "
I opened the lobby door with one hand and propped it open with my foot as I maneuvered the dolly through the entry way .
" The agency has n't made any announcement about that to the press , much less The Biz , " I said .
" Where did you hear about it ? "
Van Doren grabbed the door and held it for me .
" I got it from Brad Turnow 's office , " he said .
" They faxed out an announcement to the press , and I got the figure from his receptionist when I called to follow up . "
I made a mental note to have Brad fire his receptionist .
" I can't comment about my client 's affairs , " I said , " If you 're looking for something , I 'm not going to give it to you . "
" I 'm not here to do anything on Michelle Beck , " Van Doren said .
" I 'm hoping to do a story on you . "
" On me ? " I said .
" Really , Van Doren .
I 'm not that interesting .
And there are no pictures of me on the Net having sex with anyone . "
" Look , we know we lost a lot of goodwill on that story , " Van Doren said .
This statement was on the same level as the captain of the Titanic saying , I guess we 've taken on a little water .
" We 're trying to get away from that sort of thing now .
Do some real journalism .
The story I 'm doing , for example , is ' The Ten Hottest Young Agents in Hollywood . ' "
" You getting ten agents to talk to you ? " I wheeled over to my car , a Honda Prelude .
" I 've got six so far , " he said .
" including one of your guys here -- Ben Fleck .
You know him ? "
" I do , " I said .
" I would n't call him one of the ten hottest young agents in Hollywood . "
Van Doren grimaced .
" Yeah , I know , " he said .
" Frankly , none of the really good young agents want to talk .
That 's why I 'm really hoping to do something on you .
I mean , twelve and a half million !
I 'd say that makes you the hottest agent in Hollywood at the moment , period .
You 're the money guy , in all senses of the term .
This is cover story material , Tom .
You need help getting that in the trunk ? " he gestured to the water bottle .
I just did not want this guy here .
" No thanks , " I said .
" It 's going up front . "
" Well , here , " he said , stepping around to the dolly .
" I 'll hold this while you get the door open . "
What could I do ?
I gave him the dolly and went to open the passenger side door .
As I opened the door , I realized I was on the wrong side of it ; Van Doren would have to put the bottle in .
I felt a mild stirring of panic .
Van Doren realized this as well .
" I 'll get it , " he said , and walked around to pick it up .
" I do n't suppose you have a cap for this -- if you hit a bump , you 're going to get it all over your interior . "
" Nope , " I said .
Van Doren shrugged .
" Your car . "
He reached down and picked up the bottle , wobbled it slightly , provoking a spike of fear to my mild stirring of panic , turned and maneuvered it onto the passenger seat .
As he stood up , his face was red and blotchy .
" Out of shape , " he said .
" Tom , do n't take this wrong , but that water smells a little off .
You 're not planning to drink it , I hope . "
" No , " I said .
" It 's from a sulfur spring one of our agents just got back from .
You heat it up and soak in it .
Good for the skin .
But stinky . "
" No kidding , " Van Doren said .
He leaned against the door , effectively blocking my ability to shut it .
" So , Tom , how about it ?
I think you 'd make a great profile .
In fact , if everything goes well , I might be able to persuade my editors to drop the other nine hottest young agents out of the story .
A cover story , Tom . "
On a normal day of my life , I would have wanted to be on the cover of The Biz about as much as I wanted to run my tongue over a cheese grater .
Today , with an alien in my passenger seat and no clue as to my future in the agency , I wanted to be on the cover of The Biz even less than that .
" Thanks , but I 'm going to pass , " I said .
" I 'm not much one for the limelight .
I save that for my clients . "
" Do you hear yourself ? " Van Doren said .
" You talk in perfect pull quote nuggets .
Come on . "
I decided to lie .
" I 'm late for dinner with my parents , " I said , nodding to the door .
He reluctantly backed away .
" And concerned about family , too .
You 're screaming to be made famous , Tom . "
I smiled , thought about saying something , thought better of it " I do n't think so , Van Doren .
Make Ben famous instead . "
I closed the door and walked over to the driver side .
" Think about it , Tom , " Van Doren said , as I got in the car .
" I 'll be around when you want to talk . "
Is that a promise or a threat ?
I wondered .
I waved , started the Prelude , and got the hell out of there .
*****
I got a ticket from the California Highway Patrol , for speeding on the 210 .
" That cop was not at all what I expected , " Joshua said .
" Neither Ponch nor John had breasts .
I 'm going to have to revise my expectations . "
No kidding .

Chapter Five
" All right , " I said .
" Question and answer time . "
" Gasp , " Joshua said .
" Torture me all you want .
But I 'll never tell you the location of the rebel base . "
Joshua and I were sitting at my dining room table .
More accurately , I was sitting at the table ; Joshua was sitting on it .
Between us was a Pizza Hut carton and the remnants of a large pepperoni pizza .
Joshua had eaten four slices .
They lay , haphazardly , near the center of his being .
I could see the slices slowly disintegrating in an osmotic haze .
It was vaguely disturbing .
" You going to eat that last piece ? " Joshua said .
" No , " I said , turning the carton towards him .
" Please . "
" Great , " Joshua said .
A pseudopod extended , folded around the crust edge , and withdrew back into his body .
The slice was surrounded and joined its brethren .
" Thanks .
I have n't had anything all day .
Carl thought it might be upsetting to you to see food rotting away in the middle of something that looked like dried glue . "
" He was right , " I said .
" That 's why he's the boss , " Joshua said .
" Okay .
Here 's the rules for the question and answer period : you ask a question , then I ask a question . "
" You have questions ? " I asked .
" Of course I have questions , " Joshua said .
" From my point of view , you 're the alien . "
" All right . "
" No lying and no evading , " Joshua said .
" I think we can be pretty safe with each others ' secrets , because , really , who are we going to tell ?
Fair enough ? "
" Fair enough , " I said .
" Good , " Joshua said .
" You go first . "
" What are you ? "
Might as well get the big one out first .
" A fine question .
I 'm a highly advanced and organized colony of single - celled organisms that work together on a macro - cellular level . "
" What does that mean ? " I asked .
" Wait your turn , " Joshua said .
" How did you get this place ?
These are nice digs . "
He was right .
They were nice digs .
Far better than I could have afforded on my own ( until today , that is ) -- a four bedroom ranch on three quarters of an acre , overlooking the valley and abutting Angeles National Forest in the back .
Occasionally I woke up and went out back to find a deer in the yard or a coyote digging through the trash .
That passes for nature here in LA .
It was just above the smog layer , too .
Such are the advantages of having prosperous parents .
My mother left it to me after my father died and she retired to Scottsdale , to be closer to her mother 's nursing home .
The only thing that could be held against it was that it was in the wrong valley -- San Gabriel , where the " real " people ( read : not in the movie business ) lived .
Every once in a while one of the other agents would mock me about that .
I would smile sweetly and ask them what the rent was on their one - bedroom condo in Van Nuys .
" I 've lived here all my life , " I said .
" My mom gave me the house when she moved .
What does ' highly advanced and organized colony of single - celled organisms ' mean ? "
" It means that each of the cells in my body is a self - contained , unspecialized organism , " Joshua said .
" How did you decide to become an agent ? "
" My dad was an agent -- a literary agent , " I said .
" When I was a kid , he 'd bring his clients over for dinner .
They were weird but fun people .
I thought it was cool that my dad knew such weird people , so I decided I wanted to be an agent .
I must have been about five .
I had no idea what an agent really did .
If you 're actually a bunch of smaller creatures , how do you get them all to move and act the way you want them to ? "
" I do n't know , " Joshua said .
" Do you know how you make your heart beat ? "
" Sure , " I said .
" My brain sends a message to my heart to keep beating . "
" Right , " Joshua said .
" But you do n't know the exact process . "
" No , " I said .
" Neither do I , " Joshua said .
" Do you have Nintendo ? "
" What ?
No , " I said .
" I had an Atari when I was younger , but that was a long time ago .
Do you have any organs , like a heart or a brain ? "
" Not exactly , " Joshua said .
" The cells take turns performing functions , based on need .
Right now , for example , the cells on my surface are collecting sensory information .
Other cells not otherwise occupied are performing cognitive functions .
The cells around the pizza are digesting it .
Like I said , I do n't think about doing these things , they just get done .
What about cable ? "
" Basic plus HBO and Spice Channel . "
" Naughty boy . "
" I wanted Showtime .
They screwed it up .
I never got around to fixing it . "
" I believe you , " Joshua said .
" Really I do . "
" Are you male or female ? " I asked .
" I'm neither , " Joshua said .
" My cells reproduce asexually .
Spice Channel will do nothing for me .
Do you have a computer with an Internet connection ? "
" I have a Mac and America Online , " I said .
" Why are you asking about these things ? "
" I do n't know if you 've noticed , but I 'm a gelatinous cube , " Joshua said .
" It 's not like I 'm going to be getting out of the house much .
The neighbors would talk .
So I want to make sure I 'm going to be able to keep myself amused .
Got any pets ? "
" I had a cat , but he ran away about two years ago .
I say ' ran away , ' but I think he was hit by a car or eaten by coyotes .
The Escobedos next door have a retriever , Ralph , that will occasionally get out of the yard and come over for a visit .
I do n't think you need to worry about Ralph , though .
He 's 15 years old .
He might be able to gum you , but that 's about it .
Anyway , he never comes in the house .
So , if your species reproduces asexually , the means you 're a clone of some other Yherajk , right ? "
" Eeeeeeeh ..... "
Joshua sounded suspiciously like he was trying to evade the question .
" Not exactly , " he said , finally .
" Our cells are asexual but we have a way of creating new ....' souls ' is probably the best word for it .
I 'd have a really difficult time explaining it to you . "
" Why ? "
" You 're out of turn . "
" You 're evading . "
" Oh .
Well , in that case , let 's say it 's a sort of societal taboo .
Asking me to talk about it would be sort of like me asking you to describe in graphic detail the sexual encounter between your parents that resulted in your conception . "
" It was during their honeymoon in Cancun , " I said .
" What position did they use ?
How many thrusts did it take ?
Did your mom bark in pleasure ? "
I reddened .
" I think I see what you 're saying . "
" I thought you might , " Joshua said .
" Speaking of which -- any brothers or sisters ? "
" No , " I said .
" Mom had complications during the pregnancy and nearly died .
They thought about adopting for a while but they decided against it .
Can you die ? "
" Sure , " Joshua said .
" More ways than you can , too .
Individual cells in this collection die all the time , like cells in your body die .
The whole collection can die , too -- I 'd say we 're probably less prone to random death than your species is , but it happens .
The soul can also die , even if the collection survives .
You in a relationship ? "
" No .
I had a girlfriend at the agency for a while , but she took a job in New York about six months ago .
It was n't very serious , anyway -- more of a tension release thing .
How long do you live ? "
" Three score and ten , just like you , " Joshua said .
" More or less .
It 's actually a very complicated question .
Do you like your job ? "
" Most of the time , " I said .
" I do n't know .
I think I 'm good at it .
And I do n't know what else I 'd do if I was n't doing this .
What 's your spaceship like ? "
" Crowded .
Smelly .
Poorly lit .
What do you when you 're not working ? "
" I 'm pretty much always working .
When I 'm not , I read a lot .
Got that from being the son of a literary agent .
When my mother moved out , I made my old room into a library .
Other than that , I do n't do too much .
I 'm sort of pathetic .
How do you know so much about us ? "
" What do you mean ? " Joshua said .
" Your English is as good as mine .
You know about stuff like Nintendo and cable television .
You make references to 50s horror films .
You seem to know more about us than most of us do . "
" No offense , but it 's not that hard being smarter than most of you folks , " Joshua said .
" Your planet 's been broadcasting a bunch of stuff for the better part of the last century .
We 've been paying attention to a lot of it .
You can actually learn English from watching situation comedies several thousand times . "
" I do n't know how to feel about that , " I said .
" There are some gaps , " Joshua allowed .
" Until I actually got down here , we were under the impression ' groovy ' was still current .
It 's all those ' Brady Bunch ' reruns .
For the longest time it never really occurred to us that they were n't live broadcasts .
We thought that the repetition had some ritual significance .
Like they were religious texts or something . "
" I 'd think the fact that the Brady Bunch never aged might have been a tip - off . "
" Do n't take this wrong , " Joshua said , " But you all pretty much look the same to us .
Anyway , we figured it out eventually .
My turn . "
*****
The question and answer session went on for another couple of hours , with me asking larger , cosmic questions , and Joshua asking smaller , personal questions .
I learned that the Yherajk spaceship was a hollowed - out asteroid that traveled at slower - than - light speeds , and that it had taken them decades to travel from their home planet to here .
Joshua learned that my favorite color was green .
I learned that Yherajk - to - Yherajk communication most often took the form of complex pheromone " ideographs " launched into the air or passed on through touch : the " speaker " was identified with an identifier molecule -- his own personal smell .
Joshua learned that I preferred eurotrash dance music to American guitar rock and roll .
At the end of it , I knew more about the Yherajk than any other person on the planet , and Joshua knew more about me than any other person on the planet .
I ended up thinking that Joshua had somehow gotten the better end of that bargain ; there was only one other person who knew about Joshua , after all .
But presumably a lot of other people knew about me .
Only one question remained unanswered : how Joshua got his name .
He refused to tell me .
" That 's not fair , " I said .
" You said no lying or evading . "
" This is the exception that proves the rule , " Joshua said .
" Besides , it 's not my story to tell .
You need to ask Carl how it came about .
Now , " he executed a maneuver that looked very much like a stretch after a long bout of sitting , " Where is that computer of yours ?
I want to sign in .
I want to see how much junk e-mail I have . "
I led him to my home office , where my computer was ; he slithered onto the seat , glopped himself onto the keyboard , and shot out a tendril to the mouse .
I was mildly worried that parts of him might get stuck in my keyboard .
But when he moved from the table on the way to the office , he did n't leave any slime trails .
Chalk one up for my upholstery .
I figured my keyboard would be okay .
I left him to clack away on AOL and headed out to the back porch .
My backyard was sloped up into the mountainside and heavily wooded in the back .
It was on slightly higher ground than the adjoining houses ' backyards -- something I appreciated greatly when I was 13 and Trish Escobedo next door would lay out next to her pool .
I settled into my usual chair , which looked out onto the Escobedo backyard -- Trish was now married and had n't lived there for nearly 12 years , but old habits died hard .
On the way out , I had pulled a beer from the fridge ; I twisted off the top and sat back to look up at the stars .
I was thinking about Joshua and the Yherajk .
Joshua was an immediate problem -- very smart , very amusing , very liquid , and , I was beginning to suspect , very prone to boredom .
I was giving him a week before he went off his rocker in the house .
I was going to have to figure some way of getting him out of the house on an occasional basis ; I did n't know what a bored Yherajk was like but I did n't aim to find out .
Priority one : field trips for Joshua .
The Yherajk were a less immediate but infinitely more complicated problem -- alien globs who want to befriend a humanity that , if asked , would probably prefer to be befriended by something with an endoskeleton .
The only thing that possibly could have been worse were if the Yherajk looked like giant bugs : that would have turned the half of humanity already afraid of spiders and roaches into insane gibbering messes .
Maybe that was the way to go : " The Yherajk -- At Least They 're Not Insects . "
I glanced back up at the stars and wondered idly if one of them was the Yherajk asteroid ship .
I heard a scratching at the side gate .
I went over to unlatch it ; Ralph , the World 's Oldest Retriever , was on the other side , huffing slightly .
His tail was wagging feebly and he was looking up at me with a tired doggie grin as if to say , I got out again .
Not bad for an old fart .
I liked Ralph .
The youngest Escabedo kid , Richie , had graduated from college and moved out about two years ago , and I suspected since then Ralph did n't get that much notice ; Esteban , who owned a mainframe software company , did n't have the time , and anyone could tell that Mary just was n't a dog person .
He was fed but ignored .
Richie used to drop by every now and then with Ralph ; he was only a few years younger than I was , and for a while had been thinking about becoming an agent before he got nervous and went pre-law instead .
After Richie moved out , Ralph would keep dropping by .
I think I reminded him of times when someone was around to pay attention to him .
I did n't mind .
Ralph did n't want anything other than to be around somebody else .
He 's like a lot of old folks that way .
Eventually Estaban or Mary would realize he was gone and would come over to get him .
Ralph would look at me sadly and follow the one or the other home .
A week later he'd get bored and the cycle would repeat .
I headed back to the patio .
Ralph shuffled along at my feet and sat next to me when I got to my chair .
I knuckled him on the head gently , and returned my thoughts to the Yherajk situation .
For some reason , a memory of my childhood popped into my head : my father , Daniel Stein , sitting at the dining room table with Krysztof Kordus , a Polish poet who had been sent to a concentration camp during the World War II after he , a Catholic , had been caught trying to smuggle Jews out of Poland .
Late in life he had emigrated to America , and he hoped that he would be able to publish his poems in English .
I eventually read the poems when I was in college .
They were terrible and beautiful : terrible in their themes of holocaust and death , beautiful because they somehow managed to find moments of hope in the shadow of that terrifying destruction .
I remember feeling the need to go out into the sun after reading them , crying because for the first time I was made to understand what happened .
I had had relatives who had died in the Holocaust : great aunts and uncles on my mother 's side .
My own grandmother had been in a work camp when the war ended .
But she would never talk about it while I was growing up , and then she had a stroke that took away her ability to speak .
It was n't until Krysztof 's poems that the story was brought home to me .
The night Krysztof and my father sat at our dining room table , however , Krysztof had received yet another rejection letter for his book .
He sat raging at my father , for not being able to sell the book , and at the publishers , for not buying the book .
" You have to understand , " My dad said to Krysztof , " Hardly anyone buys books of poetry anymore . "
" I understand shit , " Krysztof said , thumping the table .
" This is what I do .
These poems are as good as any you will find in the bookstore .
Better .
You must be able to convince someone to buy these , Daniel .
That is what you do . "
" Krysztof , " my father said , " The bottom line is that no one is going to publish these poems right now .
If you were Elie Wiesel , you could sell these poems .
But you 're nobody here .
No one knows you .
No publisher is going to throw money away publishing poems that no one 's going to read . "
That set Krysztof off for another ten minutes on the stupidity of my father , the publishing world , and the American people in general , for not recognizing genius when it sat arrayed before them .
Dad sat there calmly , waiting for Krysztof to take a breath .
When he did , my dad jumped in .
" You 're not listening to what I 'm saying , Krysztof , " he said .
" I know these poems are masterworks .
That 's not in dispute .
The problem is not the poems , it 's you .
No one knows who you are . "
" Who cares about me , " Krysztof said .
" The poems , they speak for themselves . "
" You 're a great man , Krysztof , " my father said .
" But you know diddly about the American public . "
And then my father told Krysztof a plan that would thereafter be known as The Trojan Horse .
The plan was simple .
In order to sell Krysztof 's poems , people had to know who Krysztof was first .
Dad accomplished this by convincing Krysztof , after much arguing and protestations of humiliation , to take a lullaby that he had written decades earlier to amuse his daughter , and publish it as a children 's book .
The book , The Dreamers and the Sleepers , sold millions , much to Krysztof 's horror and my father 's delight .
During the publicity tour for the book , Krysztof 's Holocaust story was splashed across the features pages of every large and mid-sized daily in the country .
From that , my father was able to wrangle a made - for - television movie on Krysztof 's story out of CBS .
It was the most widely - watched television show that month .
Krysztof was embarrassed ( he was played by Lee Majors ) but also both rich and famous .
" There , " my dad said .
" Now we can sell your book of poems . "
And he did .
I needed a Trojan Horse .
There had to be some back door way to slip the Yherajk through , like my dad did with Krysztof .
But I had no idea what it was .
It 's one thing to sell a book of poems .
It 's another thing entirely to introduce a planet to the thing they 've hoped for and feared for the last century .
The doorbell rang .
Ralph looked at me sadly .
I patted his flank gently , and then we went to answer the door .

Chapter Six
I glanced through the window into my office .
" Tell me that 's not Tea Reader I see in there , " I said .
" All right , " Miranda said .
" That 's not Tea Reader you see in there . "
" Thank you for conforming to my reality , " I said .
" Not at all , " Miranda said .
" It 's an honor and a privilege . "
I grabbed my door knob , took a deep breath , and went into my office .
If nothing else , Tea Reader was heart - stoppingly beautiful ; half Hawaiian , half Hungarian , five feet ten inches , and naturally possessed of the sort of proportions that most women insist exist only on foot - high plastic dolls .
Her record company publicist once drunkenly confided in me that his company estimated at least 45 % of Tea 's record sales were to boys aged thirteen through fifteen , who bought them for the CD insert that featured Tea rising from the waters of the Pacific , clad in a thin t- shirt and a thong bikini bottom , both a particularly transparent shade of tan .
I drunkenly confided to him that , when I had inherited her from my former podmate , I held the poorly masked hope that she might be one of those actresses who occasionally slept with their agents .
Then I got to know her .
I learned to be glad that she was not .
" Hello , Tea , " I said .
" Hello , Tom , you miserable fuckhead , " Tea said .
" Always a pleasure to see you , too , Tea , " I said .
I walked to my desk and set down .
" Now , " I said .
" How can I help you ? "
" You can explain to me why I suddenly seem to be represented by Little Miss Hysterical over here . "
Tea motioned to the far chair in the corner , where Amanda Hewson sat , crying .
At the mention of her existence , Amanda let out an audible sob and lifted her feet , in an attempt to curl into a fetal position while still sitting .
The chair was getting in the way .
" Amanda is a full agent here at the company , " I said .
" And she 's quite good . "
" Bullshit , " Tea said .
Amanda gave another sob .
Tea rolled her eyes dramatically and shouted over her shoulder at Amanda .
" Could you please shut the fuck up ? "
She said .
" I 'm trying to talk my real agent over here , and it 's hard enough without you crying a fucking river . "
Amanda exploded from her seat like a flock of birds flushed out of the underbrush , and attempted to flee the room .
She grabbed at the door , pulled it , and whacked herself on the side of the face .
I winced ; that was going to leave a mark .
Amanda wailed and sprinted towards her pod .
Tea watched the scene and then turned back to me .
She had the expression of the cat who ate the canary and then threw it up in her owner 's favorite shoes .
" Where were we ? " she said .
" That was n't very nice , " I said , mildly .
" I 'll tell you what 's not very fucking nice , Tom , " Tea said .
" It 's not nice to get back from Honolulu , where I 've been visiting my family , and having a message from Mandy , telling me how excited she is to be working with me . "
From her sinister stretch , Tea straightened up , preternaturally perky .
Her voice became a dead - on ringer for Amanda 's Girl Scout - like tone .
" ' I have your album !
I love to listen to it while I 'm exercising ! ' "
Tea slouched again .
" Great .
Add that to the half that are whacking off to my picture on the cover , sister . "
" It 's actually only forty five percent , " I said .
Tea 's eyes narrowed .
" What ? "
" Forty five percent whacking off , " I said .
" Your record company 's own estimate .
Tea , Amanda 's working with me .
She 's my assistant . "
" I thought Miss Bitch back there was your assistant , " Tea said , jerking a thumb towards Miranda 's desk .
" She almost did n't let me in to your office today .
I was getting ready to smack her . "
Before getting her act together and working her way through college , Miranda spent a reasonable portion of her teen years gang - banging in East LA .
One night , at a company party , Miranda showed me her collection of scars , inflicted by razors in a number of cat fights .
The other girls got it worse , she said .
I did n't suspect Tea realized how close to death she had gotten this morning .
" Miranda is my administrative assistant , " I said .
" Amanda is working with me with some of my clients . "
" Well , I do n't want to work with her , " Tea said .
" Why not ? "
" Hello ?
Tom ?
Did you not see Miss Mandy in here today ?
What a fucking crybaby . "
" How did she get that way , Tea ? " I asked .
" Beats me , " Tea said .
" We were just sitting here , waiting for you , and I was just telling her that there was no fucking way on the planet she was going to be my agent . "
" How long were you in here before I got here ? "
Tea shrugged .
" A half hour , forty five minutes . "
" I see , " I said .
" And you do n't think being shat on for three - quarters of an hour is a good reason to get upset . "
" Hey , " Tea sat up again and jabbed a finger at me , " You 're the one that put her in that situation .
Do n't get angry at me because I went off on her a little . "
" Forty five minutes is not a little , Tea , " I said .
" What the fuck does that mean ?
I 'm the one getting screwed here . "
She slumped back , sullen .
I was getting a headache .
" Tea , what do you want from me ? " I asked .
" I want you to do your fucking job , " Tea said .
" I 'm not giving you ten percent so you can palm me off on Mandy , the Teenage Agent .
I can think of about ten agents in town who'd get on their hands and knees to represent me .
You 're not doing me any favors , Tom . "
" Really , " I said .
" Ten agents . "
" At least . "
" Fine , " I said .
" Name one . "
" What ? "
" Name one , " I said .
" Give me the name of one of those agents . "
" Hell , no , " Tea said .
" Why should I tell you who your competition is ?
Stay nervous . "
Tea said .
" Nervous ?
Hell , Tea , I want to call them up , " I said .
" If they 're so gung - ho to have you , I 'll let you go .
I do n't want you to be unhappy .
So let 's do this thing .
Let 's get it over with .
Unless you 're running off at the mouth . "
That got her .
" Alan Finley at ACR , " she said .
I buzzed Miranda .
She came to the door .
" Yes , Tom ? "
" Miranda , would you call Alan Finley over at Associated Client Representation , and put him on the speaker when you get him ? "
" Sure , Tom . "
" Thanks , " I said .
" Oh , one other thing .
After you get Alan , would you mind bringing me Tea 's file ? "
" Not at all , " Miranda said .
" Do you want the whole file ? "
" Just the clippings , please , Miranda . "
Miranda smiled slightly and glanced at Tea .
" Delighted to , Tom. Tea , " she said .
Tea fairly snarled at Miranda as she closed the door .
" Fucking bitch , " Tea said .
" Did you see that look she gave me ? "
" I must have missed it , " I said .
Miranda 's voice clicked in over the speaker phone .
" Alan Finley at ACR , Tom , " she said , and left the line .
A male voice piped up .
" Tom ?
You there ? "
" Ho , Alan , " I said .
" How are things over there at ACR these days ? "
" The land of milk and honey , Tom .
We 're giving away Bentleys as party favors .
You want one ? "
Two weeks ago , an ACR internal memo made its way to Variety ; in it , ACR 's CEO Norm Jackson offered a Rolls Royce to the agent who stole the most A - list clients from other agencies in the next three months .
Jackson first declared it a forgery , and then tried to chalk it up as an inside joke .
Nobody bit .
Long - time clients were offended that they , by implication , were not A - listers , and started jumping ship .
Clients in the process of being wooed by ACR stopped returning calls .
Variety suggested that the second - place winner get Norm Jackson 's job .
" I 'll pass for now , Alan , but I hope you remember me during the holidays , " I said .
" Listen , Alan .
Got a question for you . "
" Shoot . "
" I have a client who has recently become , shall we say , dissatisfied with the quality of representation she 's receiving here .
She 's thinking of going over there . "
" Well , are n't you just the helpful one , Tom , " Alan said .
" Is it Michelle Beck ?
You can send her right along .
I 'll get that Rolls after all . "
I laughed .
He laughed .
Tea glared at the speakerphone .
" Sorry , Alan .
The client is Tea Reader .
You know her . "
" Sure .
I bought her CD .
For the picture on the inside , mostly . "
Tea looked like she was about to say something , but I put my finger to my lips .
" Right , " I said .
" So are you interested ?
Want to take her on ? "
" Jesus , Tom , you 're actually serious ? "
" Sure am , Alan .
Serious as a heart attack . "
" She would n't happen to be there at the moment , would she ? "
" Nope , " I said .
That , at the very least , would keep Tea quiet for a few minutes .
" Just you and me .
You want her ? "
" Fuck , no , Tom , " Alan said .
" I hear she 's a harpy . "
Tea looked like she 'd been slapped .
" I hear she drove her last agent insane .
You knew him , right ? "
" Yeah , " I said .
" We were podmates . "
" That 's right .
Cracked up like Northridge in a quake is what I heard .
Became a moonie or a Scientologist or something wacko like that . "
" Buddhist , actually . "
" Close enough , " Alan said .
" No offense , Tom .
I have enough clients who make me want to get religion , so I could be assured that there was a Hell for them to be sent to .
I could look at Tea for hours .
Would n't want to be in the same room as her , though .
Certainly would n't want to represent her .
How do you manage it , anyway ? "
" Just a saint , I suppose , " I said .
" Well , look , Alan , you know anyone over there who might want to have her ? "
" Not off the top of my head .
I think everybody 's perfectly happy to let you represent her for as long as you want , pal .
I 'll remember you in my prayers , if it will make you feel any better . "
" It does , it does , " I said .
" Thanks , Alan . "
" Sure , Tom .
Be sure to let me know when Michelle gets bored with you .
Her , I 'd put up with . "
He hung up .
" Well , " I said .
" That was certainly instructive . "
" Fuck you , " Tea said , and stared off out a side window .
Miranda came in , dropped a file on my desk , and left .
" What is that ? "
Tea asked .
" This is your clipping file , " I said .
" Our clipping service scours the trades and the magazines for a reference to any of our clients and sends them on to us .
So we always know what people are thinking about the people we represent . "
I separated the clips into two piles .
One was very small .
The other was not .
I pointed to the smaller pile .
" Do you know what this is ? " I asked .
Tea looked over , shrugged .
" No . "
" These are your positive notices , " I said .
" They 're mostly about the fact that you 're built like Barbie , although there 's one here that says you were the best thing about that Pauly Shore flick you were in , with the further admission that that is a textbook example of damning with faint praise . "
I thumped the other , much larger pile with an open palm .
" This , " I said , " is your pile of negative notices .
We have an office pool here , you know .
We 've got bets on how thick this pile is going to get by the end of the year .
Right now , it 's a modest three inches .
But it 's early yet . "
Tea looked bored .
" Is this going somewhere ? "
I gave up .
" Tea , I 've been trying to find some way to put this delicately .
Let me make it simple : Nobody in town likes you .
No one .
You 're monstrously difficult .
People do n't like working with you .
People do n't like being seen with you .
People do n't even like being in the same room with you .
Even the thirteen year old boys who fantasize about you know enough not to like you as a person .
In the grand pantheon of contemporary bitches of Hollywood , it 's you , Shannon Doherty and Sean Young . "
" I'm not anything like them , " Tea said .
" I still have a career . "
" You sure do , " I said .
" And you have me to thank for it .
Any other agent would have written you off long ago .
You 're good looking , but that 's not exactly a rare thing around these parts .
I have to fight to get you work .
And every time I do get you work , I hear back about how everybody on that crew would rather chew glass than work with you again .
Everyone .
They have craft service workers who wo n't cater a set you 're on .
My best estimate is that you have about another 18 months before we run out of people who'll work with you .
After that you 'll have to find some nice , 80 - year oil tycoon you can marry and screw into a coma . "
Tea was dumbstruck .
It could n't last .
It did n't .
" Gee , Tom .
Thanks for the vote of confidence . "
" The vote of confidence is n't for you , Tea .
I 'm giving you two choices here .
The first choice is to sit here , shut up and do what I tell you .
We may have an outside chance of saving your career if you do .
The other is not to sit here , shut up , and do what I tell you .
In which case , I 'm dropping you and you can get the hell out of my office .
It really does n't matter to me which you do .
Actually , I 'm lying .
I 'd prefer it if you left .
But it 's up to you .
What 's it going to be ? "
Tea sat there with a gaze of pure , unadulterated hate .
It was unnervingly arousing .
I ignored it and went on .
" All right , then .
The first thing you 're going to do is apologize to Amanda . "
" Fuck , no , " Tea said .
" Fuck , yes , " I said , " or we have no deal .
I realize you did n't notice this while you were dismantling her , but Amanda may have been the only person in the entire Los Angeles metropolitan area who actually genuinely liked you .
There are 17 million people in the LA basin , Tea .
You need her . "
" The hell I do , " Tea said .
" Tea , " I said .
" Two words .
' Boinking Grandpa . ' "
" Fuck , " Tea said .
" All right . "
" Thank you , " I said .
" The second thing you 're going to do is trust me .
Amanda is n't much to look at at the moment , but she 's going to devote more of her brain to you than she does to herself .
Work with her .
Try to be nice .
In the comfort of your own home , you can stab life - sized dolls dressed up to look like her , for all I care .
But give her something to work with .
Understand ? "
" Fine , " Tea said .
She was hating this .
" Great , " I said .
" Off you go , then . "
" What , you want me to apologize now ? "
She was genuinely shocked .
" No time like the present , Tea .
She 's in the building , you 're in the building .
It 's more convenient that way . "
Tea got up , gave me one last glare , and exited the office , slamming the door on the way out .
I sat there for a good f
