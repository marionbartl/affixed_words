Good morning Battlefrontians !
It seems like an eternity since my last post and there is still nothing really new to ...
The rules affecting interstate truckers and bus drivers will take longer to put in place and may be more nuanced .
Image Department of Transportation Secretary Ray H. LaHood on Thursday announced the measures aimed at curbing what he called a deadly epidemic of distracted driving .

Mr. LaHood said the rule would “ ban text messaging altogether ” by such drivers .
But Rose A. McMurray , acting administrator for the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration , which regulates the trucking industry , said there would first need to be a definition of “ text messaging . ”
The question facing the trucking industry in particular is what will become of the computers that thousands of long - haul truckers use in their cabs to communicate with dispatchers and do other work .
Research from the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute shows that these devices can markedly increase the risk of causing a crash or near crash if used when driving .
Its research also shows that truckers often bypass warnings to not use the devices while driving .
Ms. McMurray said she expected that it would take several months to complete a rule governing buses and trucks , during which time the agency would study the “ array of devices ” used by these drivers .
She said that she expected to ban truckers from texting with their phones and also to ban behavior “ that would require fingers to manipulate a keyboard , or to take the eyes off the road ” to use a keyboard and , possibly , other technologies used for typing .
The trucking industry has said it is concerned that texting bans in general could have unintended consequences of interfering with devices that truckers have come to rely on .
Earlier this year we brought you the scoop on Zele International ’s Nissan R35 GT-R : “ Complete Edition ” that was set to debut at the Tokyo Auto Salon in early 2009 .
Apparently the reception was a warm one , because Zele is flying its mascot to SEMA 2009 .
The company started as a Skyline dealership but is quickly making a name for itself as a high - end one - stop tuning shop for anything Nissan .
Pele has accomplshed this by building 8 exclusive Nissan R35 GT - R models called the “ Complete Edition . ”
They will be displaying this Carbon Fiber - clad warrior at the ENEOS performance motor oil booth and , trust me , this car will stand out .
Instead of bolting in turbos and bragging about their latest dyno pull , Zele Performance went about modifying the GTR using the Goldilocks theory ; not too hot , not too cold …….
Although its parts list is longer than the P800 from Switzer , only 3 of those parts influence the horsepower .
A Zele ECU and titanium turbo - back exhaust bring power up to 550 hp and the Bilstein suspension ( which they perfected at the Ebisu , Tsukuba and Fuji Speedway racetracks ) adds another dimension .
The list of carbon fiber parts is long but here are the highlights : hood , roof , wing and rear diffuser .
This shop is playing for keeps .
I am very impressed with how Zele International designs their body kit and trim pieces .
Too often it looks like someone designed a side skirt while hiding in a cave in the Mojave desert , without even seeing the car the piece would be attached to .
Zele appears to understand what it means to design a car , not just the part .
Both cars will stand out at SEMA , and hopefully continue to draw praise .
We ’ll have more SEMA cars for you soon , and keep your eyes here for what other great things Zele undoubtedly has in store for us .

WASHINGTON , Oct. 7 ( UPI ) -- Advances in DNA technology and the willingness of victims to work with police are reducing the number of reported U.S. rapes , advocates say .
Statistics provided by the FBI indicate 89,000 women reported being raped in 2008 , or 29 women per 100,000 people , which is well down from the 109,062 reported rapes in 1992 , or 43 women for every 100,000 people , USA Today reported Wednesday .

" We have seen reform in how police work with victims , gather evidence and investigate rape ; we 've seen increased awareness of the crime , and we 've seen better prosecution , " Michael Males , senior researcher for the Center on Juvenile & Criminal Justice in San Francisco , told the newspaper .
" Hospitals now have rape kits that they did n't have 40 years ago . "
" The level of interest and professionalism dealing with sexual assault cases increased as a result , " added Scott Berkowitz , president of the victims advocacy group Rape , Abuse & Incest National Network .
Kim Gandy , past president of the National Organization for Women and a former prosecutor , told USA Today DNA testing can now pinpoint a rapist , enabling prosecutors to use more than just a victim 's identification of an attacker .

Impfstoff gegen Schweinegrippe : Bundeswehr wird bevorzugt
Die Bundeswehr hat ein Medikament ohne umstrittene Verstärker bestellt .
Experten empfehlen es auch für Schwangere und Kinder .
Doch die bekommen über die Länder andere Impfungen .
KASSEL taz | " Wir sind nichts Besseres , wir sind etwas Anderes " , sagt Oberstleutnant Peter Fuss zum Thema Schweinegrippe - Impfstoff für die Bundeswehr .
Die Armee hat , wie jetzt bekannt wurde , eine eigene Bestellung für Impfstoff gegen das H1N1 - Virus aufgegeben .
Anders als die Bundesländer wird sie vom Pharmakonzern Baxter beliefert .
Die Soldaten erhalten ein Vakzin , das ohne umstrittene Verstärkersubstanzen , sogenannte Adjuvanzien , hergestellt wird .
Das birgt Zündstoff .
Denn nicht wenige Mediziner halten den nichtadjuvantierten Impfstoff für sicherer als den , der bald für die breite Bevölkerung in Deutschland zur Verfügung steht .
Die Ständige Impfkommission zum Beispiel hat gerade empfohlen , Schwangere mit nichtadjuventierten Vakzinen zu impfen , bis es bessere Daten zur Verträglichkeit der anderen gibt .
Die Arzneimittelkommission der deutschen Ärzteschaft sprach Mitte September eine ähnliche Empfehlung aus - nicht nur für Schwangere , sondern auch für Kinder .
Die Impfkommission bei der WHO erklärte im Juli , für Schwangere solle vorzugsweise nichtadjuvanzierter Impfstoff verwendet werden .
Die Bundesländer aber beharrten bis vor kurzem auf Bestellungen und Optionen bei GlaxoSmithKline und Novartis .
Beide Firmen produzieren mit Adjuvanzien , beide haben in den vergangenen Jahren ihre Produktionskapazitäten in Deutschland kräftig ausgebaut .
Logistische Überlegungen seien für die Lieferantenwahl ausschlaggebend gewesen , sagt Thomas Schulz , Sprecher von Thüringens Gesundheitsministerium , das die Bestellung koordiniert .
Das Paul - Ehrlich - Institut hat die adjuvantierten Impfstoffe bislang stets für ausreichend sicher erklärt .
Auch im Sanitätsdienst der Bundeswehr heißt es : " Unsere Fachmediziner sagen , die Unterschiede sind minimal . "
Doch in der Zufriedenheit mit der eigenen Bestellung klingen andere Töne mit : Man habe " Glück gehabt " , sagt Presseoffizier Fuss .
Weil Soldaten sehr viele Impfungen bekämen , sei es gut , wenn nicht überall Zusatzstoffe enthalten seien , die sich vielleicht nicht vertragen .
Inzwischen sondieren auch Bund und Länder , ob noch nichtadjuventierter Impfstoff beschafft werden kann .
Die Bestellung solle für alle Schwangeren ausreichen , heißt es in Thüringen .
Was ist mit Kindern ?
Der Ministeriumssprecher betont , für wen welche Impfung geeignet sei , sei eine " medizinische Entscheidung , keine politische " .

The government of the Maldives has held a cabinet meeting underwater to highlight the threat of global warming to the low - lying Indian Ocean nation .
President Mohamed Nasheed and his cabinet signed a document calling for global cuts in carbon emissions .
Ministers spent half an hour on the sea bed , communicating with white boards and hand signals .
The president said the UN climate change conference in Copenhagen this December can not be allowed to fail .
At a later press conference while still in the water , President Nasheed was asked what would happen if the summit fails .
" We are going to die , " he replied .
If the Maldives can not be saved today we do not feel that there is much of a chance for the rest of the world
President Mohamed Nasheed
Officials in climate change stunt The Maldives stand an average of 2.1 metres ( 7ft ) above sea level , and the government says they face being wiped out if oceans rise .
" We 're now actually trying to send our message , let the world know what is happening , and what will happen to the Maldives if climate change is not checked , " President Nasheed said .
" If the Maldives can not be saved today we do not feel that there is much of a chance for the rest of the world , " he added .
Military minders
Three of the 14 cabinet ministers missed the underwater meeting , about 20 minutes by boat from the capital , Male , because two were not given medical permission and another was abroad , officials said .
President Nasheed and other cabinet members taking part had been practising their slow breathing to get into the right mental frame for the meeting , a government source said .
The cabinet were joined by instructors and military escorts
About 5 m underwater , in a blue - green lagoon on a small island used for military training , they were observed by a clutch of snorkelling journalists .
Each minister was accompanied by a diving instructor and a military minder .
While underwater , they signed a document ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen in December , calling on all nations to cut their carbon emissions .
World leaders at the summit aim to create a new agreement to replace the 1997 Kyoto Protocol , which expires in 2012 .

Does anybody at Fox give a damn whether people die because of the fear and paranoia Glenn Beck puts on the air ?
On Thursday , I want you to join me for a special show , an hour - long special on the swine flu .
I am not going to give you my opinion on the swine flu , I do n't think anybody but your doctor should give their opinion on the swine flu .
This is for every American to ask themselves , " Am I going to give this injection to my children ? "
We 're going to have a half - hour of those who say " Absolutely not " -- medical doctors .
And then the second - half is " Are you crazy ?
You must . "
You decide .
That 'll be a special hour Thursday .
Honest questions , I do n't think are going to be asked or answered anyplace else .
So what do you think the Glenn Beck Show 's next gimmick will be ?
An hour long special on eating lead paint chips ?
30 minutes of pro-paint chips people , and 30 minutes of anti-paint chips people ?
Or maybe he 'll discuss the pros and cons of putting your hand in the toaster .
He can bring in Orly Taitz , foremost expert on hand - toaster interactions , and Michael Scheuer on how Obama 's Hitleresque government is trying to take away your freedom to stick your hand in your toaster whenever you want .
So what 's your guess ?
What 'll Glenn 's next gimmick be ?

WHO PAINTED FACES ON MY BEATLES WHITE ALBUM ?!
The pink colouring is caused by a genetic mutation An " unusual " pink grasshopper has been discovered during a wildlife event at a Devon nature reserve .
The insect was found by 11 - year - old Daniel Tate at Seaton Marshes near Sidmouth .
He said he thought it was a flower until he saw it jump and then he realised it was a grasshopper .
The insect was later identified by wildlife officers as a young adult meadow grasshopper , which has been born pink through genetic mutation .
There is a chance it will live to reproduce and pass on its pink gene
James Chubb , East Devon Education Ranger Daniel , who attended the " mini- beasts " event with his great grandfather , said : " I was looking for grasshoppers when I saw something pink .
" I thought it was a flower but I saw it moving , so I tried to catch it .
It jumped and then I knew it was a grasshopper . "
James Chubb , education ranger for East Devon District Council , said : " There are billions of meadow grasshoppers across England but this is the first pink one I have ever seen .
" It is caused by a genetic mutation in its reproductive cycle .
" It 's almost a full adult , so if it has survived this long being bright pink there is a chance it will live to reproduce and pass on its pink gene . "
He said grasshoppers of different colours were " unusual " but not unheard of .

America 's chief spook has been banned from internet banking by his wife after nearly falling prey to a common email phishing scam .
FBI Director Robert Mueller was in San Francisco on Wednesday to advocate public vigilance against cybercrime .
Speaking to the non-profit public affairs org , the Commonwealth Club of California , Mueller admitted that he himself barely dodged a con from the oldest trick in the cyber - criminal handbook .
Mueller recalled how , not long ago , he received an email purportedly from his bank that looked " perfectly legitimate . "
The email requested he verify some personal information , and Mueller obliged with the instructions before realizing " this might not be such a good idea . "
The FBI chief said he quickly changed all his passwords and tried to pass the incident off to his wife as a " teachable moment . "
But she replied : " It is not my teachable moment .
However , it is our money .
No more internet banking for you ! "
Mueller said while such scams are an every day occurrence , similar internet chicanery is being used by " criminals , spies , and terrorists . "
Be afraid , be very afraid .
Mueller : e- free banking
" We know the game plan of our adversaries .
They will keep twisting the doorknobs and picking the locks until they find a way in .
But we must not let them in .
We must change the locks .
We must bar the doors .
And we must sound the alarms when we notice anything out of the ordinary . "
Yet not everyone in attendance was convinced it 's the cyber criminals that are the biggest threat to America .
When questions were read from the audience , one ( smartly ) anonymous query began : " I 'm not worried about a teenage hacker reading my email .
I 'm worried about you reading it . "
Mueller responded that the questioner should in fact worry about the teenager " so much more " than the FBI .
The G - man general said while preventing internet crime is incredibly difficult , the US government has struck " a pretty good balance " between respecting civil liberties and stewarding national security .
His speech was delivered the day US and Egyptian officials announced they 've charged 100 people with conducting a phishing operation they call the biggest cybercrime case ever .
A transcript of Mueller 's speech can be found at the FBI website .
Or at least , what looks like the FBI website . ®
SEATTLE , Washington ( CNN ) --
Who is stealing -- and crashing -- airplanes in Washington state ?
Police say they found this self - portrait of Colton Harris - Moore in the deleted file of a stolen digital camera .
The 18 - year - old man police call the prime suspect does not have a pilot 's license .
But he does have a nickname -- " The Barefoot Burglar " -- and a Facebook fan club , which compares him to Jesse James " without the murders " and exhorts : " Fly , Colt , Fly . "
Police say Colton " Colt " Harris - Moore has been linked to crimes in five counties involving planes , luxury cars and boats .
He 's known to alternate between squatting in vacant vacation homes , which he allegedly burglarizes , and roughing it in the woods .
Since November , police say , at least three small , private planes have been stolen and flown away .
The latest to go missing crash - landed last week in a clearing in Granite Falls , Washington , after running out of fuel , police said .
The rough landing damaged the Cessna 182 , which along with its instruments is worth more than $ 500,000 .
But authorities said the plane 's pilot appears to have walked away unhurt .
Harris - Moore has not been charged in any of the plane thefts .
But authorities are testing vomit found in the cockpit of one plane to see whether they can place the teen inside .
Harris - Moore has been on authorities ' radar for years .
" Colt , " as he is called , was first arrested for burglary at age 12 , said Detective Ed Wallace , a spokesman for the Island County Sheriff 's Office .
The break - in at a local school earned Colton a few weeks in a juvenile facility , Wallace said .
Local media reports tally nine arrests for Harris - Moore before the age of 15 .
Now police in five counties in Washington state are looking for him .
Harris - Moore dropped out of high school and , according to Wallace , police believe he spent his teens burglarizing unoccupied homes on Camano Island , a vacation community of about 15,000 people off the Washington state coast .
He became known as " the Barefoot Burglar , " because , investigators say , he preferred to prowl shoeless .
Gradually , Wallace alleges , Harris - Moore moved onto more sophisticated crimes .
" He will typically break into a home or vehicle and copy down the credit card numbers , " Wallace said .
" He then leaves the credit cards behind so people do n't realize they have been stolen . "
Wallace said Harris - Moore has charged thousands of dollars worth of video games , GPS devices and police scanners online , using stolen credit cards .
When Harris - Moore was n't squatting in homes , he took to the woods with survival gear to elude police .
He 's been known to hide in the trees .
" He 's almost like a feral child , " Wallace said .
Harris - Moore 's days of running from authorities on the 40 - square - mile island appeared to end in 2007 when he was arrested and pleaded guilty to three counts of burglary .
Wallace said some of the charges were dismissed as part of the guilty plea .
Less than a year later , Wallace said , Harris - Moore allegedly walked away from a juvenile halfway house .
Police on Camano Island again began receiving reports of thefts that fit Harris - Moore 's profile , Wallace said .
In 2008 , a deputy said he spotted Harris - Moore in a stolen Mercedes - Benz , but he lost the suspect when he allegedly dove from the moving vehicle .
After the chase , police recovered a stolen digital camera from the car .
Wallace said he found a deleted self - portrait of Harris - Moore , who posed in a shirt with a telltale Mercedes - Benz insignia .
The shirt also belonged to the vehicle 's owner .
Harris - Moore faces 10 counts in that case , as well as other thefts , Internet crimes and burglaries , Wallace said .
Charges are expected soon in a dozen more cases .
Harris - Moore dropped from sight for a while when wanted posters of him went up around Camano Island .
Soon , though , authorities in the San Juan Islands noticed a series of break -ins and wondered whether Harris - Moore was island - hopping .
The theft of a Cessna 182 from the San Juan Islands in November jogged Wallace 's memory .
He recalled what he had found on a computer he said Harris - Moore used .
" He had looked at flight manuals and how to fly a plane , " he said .
Another theft of a small experimental plane had been reported in September .
John Zerby , undersheriff of San Juan County , said police do n't think the two thefts are a coincidence .
" This does n't happen here , that 's why we think they go together , " he said .
Police consider Harris - Moore to be a fugitive .
Even though Harris - Moore has no known flight training , Zerby said police are certain he is their mystery pilot .
Harris - Moore 's mother doubts her son learned to fly on his own .
" Any time anything is stolen , they blame it on Colt , " Pam Kohler told the Everett Herald newspaper .
" Let 's say you 're the smartest person in the world .
Would n't you need a little bit of training in flying a plane ?
They 're not easy . "
CNN attempted to contact Kohler , but her phone was disconnected .
CNN also tried to reach a former attorney for Harris - Moore but the lawyer has not returned calls requesting comment .
Experts said that teaching oneself to fly is difficult but not impossible .
" It 's been heard of , " said flight instructor Devin Tolentino .
" Let 's face it , the Wright brothers were able to teach themselves .
Landing would be the hardest part , but if you were n't too concerned about using the plane again , it could be done . "
Meanwhile , authorities in Whatcom County are investigating whether Harris - Moore stole a boat and used it to reach Point Roberts , where burglaries at three vacation homes have recently been reported , Deputy Jeff Roberts said .
Point Roberts , a small peninsula , is U.S. territory but is accessible only from the water or through Canada .
From parts of Point Roberts , entering Canada is just a matter of crossing the street .
Last week , law enforcement agencies got a new lead when a private plane was stolen in Bonner 's Ferry , Idaho , just across the border from Canada .
Residents noticed a plane flying at an altitude of 100 feet as it left the area on Tuesday , said Detective Dave McClelland .
The plane was found Thursday , crashed and out of fuel in a patch of cleared forest in Granite Falls , Washington .
On Sunday , authorities say they received a report of a burglary .
" Blankets , shoes and food [ were ] taken instead of big - ticket items like TVs , " said sheriff 's spokeswoman Rebecca Hover .
A gunshot rang out as deputies searched the woods and came across some of the stolen items , Hover said .
No one was injured , but the SWAT team was called in .
Police searched the area , using a helicopter with an infrared heat detection scanner and another Blackhawk helicopter provided by the Department of Homeland Security .
Low - tech police work led to Harris - Moore 's arrest in 2005 .
Police staked out his mother 's house , waiting until someone inside ordered a pizza .
Police rode in the delivery car to the house and waited for Harris - Moore to come to them .

Advertisement A prominent US abortion doctor has been shot dead at a church in the city of Wichita , Kansas .
Dr George Tiller , one of the few US doctors who performed late - term abortions , had been vilified by anti-abortionists in the US .
The gunman fled in a car , but officials say a suspect is now in custody .
US Attorney General Eric Holder said the US would offer protection to " appropriate people and facilities " in the wake of Dr Tillers ' killing .
Dr Tiller 's clinic - called Women 's Health Care Services - had often been the site of demonstrations , and he had been shot and wounded by an assailant 16 years ago .
Questioning of the suspect , a 51 year - old man , is continuing .
Wichita Deputy Police Chief Tom Stolz said he was likely to face one charge of murder and two counts of aggravated assault for allegedly pointing a gun at two other men .
Profile : George Tiller Dr Tiller , who was 67 , was shot just after 1000 ( 1500 GMT ) at the Reformation Lutheran Church .
His lawyer , Dan Monnat , said his client was killed while serving as an usher during a morning church service .
His wife was in the choir at the time .
Dr Tiller 's widow , four children and 10 grandchildren issued a statement calling his killing " an unspeakable tragedy " .
The statement said : " This is particularly heart - wrenching because George was shot down in his house of worship , a place of peace . "
They said his death was a loss for Wichita and for women across America , saying he had dedicated his life to providing women with high - quality health care , despite frequent threats and violence .
' Cowardly ' Anti-abortion groups also denounced the shooting .
In a statement , Troy Newman of Operation Rescue said his group had worked for years through peaceful and legal means and through the proper channels to see Dr Tiller " brought to justice " .
ANTI - ABORTION ATTACKS
Oct 1998 : Dr Barnett Slepian shot dead , Buffalo , New York Jan 1998 : Policeman killed in blast at clinic near Birmingham , Alabama Dec 30 1994 :
Two receptionists shot dead at clinics near Boston July 1994 : Dr John Britton and a volunteer escort killed outside clinic , Pensacola , Florida " We denounce vigilantism and the cowardly act that took place this morning . "
Phill Kline , an opponent of Dr Tiller and a former attorney - general of the state of Kansas , said : " I am stunned by this lawless and violent act , which must be condemned and should be met with the full force of law . "
President Barack Obama said he was shocked and outraged over the killing .
" However profound our differences as Americans over difficult issues such as abortion , they cannot be resolved by heinous acts of violence , " Mr Obama said .
The shooting came two weeks after the president made a major speech on abortion at one of the main Catholic universities in the US .
Correspondents say the president is attempting to defuse the abortion issue - a highly emotive subject in US public life - by arguing that while it should remain legal , the government should do all it can to limit the number of unwanted pregnancies .
But members of the anti-abortion movement have been angered by the president 's reversal of restrictions on federal funding for embryonic stem cell research and for family - planning groups which carry out or facilitate abortions outside the US .
Under Kansas state law , abortions later in pregnancy are legal only if two independent physicians agree that the mother could suffer irreparable harm by giving birth .
Dr Tiller 's clinic is one of just three in the US to perform abortions after 21 weeks .

Does America Have the Best Health Care in the World ?
Americans do n't think so :
According to Americans , the United States does not have the best health care in the world .
Most see our health care as average ( 32 % ) or below average ( 27 % ) when compared with health care in other industrialized countries .
Only 15 % support the often - used political talking point that America has the best health care in the world ; 23 % say it is above average .
If anything , they 're being too generous .
If you include the value we get for our dollar , and the grim landscape for the un- and underinsured , America 's health care is far below average .
That paragraph , by the way , comes via Adam Serwer , who points out the " the survey also notes that the more money you make , the more likely you are to believe that America does have the best health care system in the world .
That , I think , says a great deal about the inherent class bias present in our national debate on health care . "
The number of dementia patients in the UK is predicted to double A failing memory may not be the first mental problem to signal the onset of Alzheimer 's disease , research suggests .
A University of Kansas study found a decline in other thinking and learning skills may be a warning sign years before diagnosis .
The spatial skills , such as reading a map or completing a jigsaw , seem to be the first to falter .
The Archives of Neurology study may help doctors to identify Alzheimer 's at an earlier stage .
Early intervention will be crucial to the effectiveness of the Alzheimer 's treatments of the future
Rebecca Wood
Alzheimer 's Research Trust
This is key as current drugs are more likely to have a significant impact if given when the disease is still in its early stages .
The latest study is based on 444 people , of whom 134 developed dementia .
In each case the participants underwent a battery of mental skills tests , and this allowed the researchers to construct computer models showing how and if these skills declined prior to a diagnosis of dementia .
The results showed that visuospatial skills - required to perceive the distance between objects - began to decline sharply three years before diagnosis .
An overall decline in mental abilities was seen in the following year .
But a sharp decline in memory skills was not registered until one year before clinical diagnosis .
Flawed strategy
The researchers said the findings suggested that focusing on failing memory as a way to detect Alzheimer 's was flawed , as it was unlikely to pick up on the earliest manifestations of the disease .
Rebecca Wood , chief executive of the Alzheimer 's Research Trust , said : " Early intervention will be crucial to the effectiveness of the Alzheimer 's treatments of the future , so methods of improving detection will become increasingly important .
" This study suggests that diagnostic tests could be broadened to pick up the disease earlier . "
Dr Susanne Sorensen , head of research at the Alzheimer 's Society , said the study underlined that changes in the brain could start to occur years before Alzheimer 's became apparent .
" More research is now needed to better understand how we can improve early diagnosis .
" With more funding for dementia research we hope treatments can be developed which target dementia in the early stages . "
It is estimated that 700,000 people in the UK have dementia , with levels expected to soar in coming years as the population ages .

After a storm of protest which grew during the day online , Daily Mail columnist Jan Moir defended her comment piece , rejecting accusations that it was homophobic .
In a highly unusual move , the Daily Mail issued a statement from Moir late today in which she hit out at the internet protests that led to more than 1,000 complaints being made to the Press Complaints Commission by 7 pm , causing the regulator 's website to crash for most of the afternoon .
Celebrities Stephen Fry and Derren Brown were among those who used their Twitter feeds to urge followers to make complaints .
Display advertising has been removed from the Mail Online webpage around Moir 's article .
Earlier today a Facebook page was set up urging users to lobby brands featured on the page , including Marks & Spencer , to pull their advertising .
" Marks & Spencer does not tolerate any form of discrimination , " said a spokesman for the retailer .
" We have asked the Daily Mail to move our advertisement away from the article .
This is a matter for the Daily Mail . "
Nestlé , which had an ad for its Nescafe brand running alongside Moir 's column on the Daily Mail website , said that the comments made by Moir were a breach of the Swiss company 's code for " mutual respect and tolerance " .
" Nestlé has no influence on the editorial content of the publications in which it advertises .
The views expressed in the article are from the author and are not shared by Nestlé , " said a spokeswoman .
" The company has consistently emphasised the importance of mutual respect and tolerance , regardless of culture , religion or nationality .
This a core company value as expressed in the Nestlé corporate business principles . "
Nestlé added that it contacted its media buying agency MindShare to investigate having its ad removed , but the Daily Mail had already stripped the web page of advertising .
BT and National Express ran ads alongside the column in the Daily Mail newspaper today .
BT , which ran an ad for BT Broadband , declined to comment , as did National Express .
" Some people , particularly in the gay community , have been upset by my article about the sad death of Boyzone member Stephen Gately .
This was never my intention , " Moir said .
She went on to defend the text of her article , which argued that Gately 's death " strikes another blow to the happy - ever - after myth of civil partnerships " .
" When I wrote that 'he would want to set an example to any impressionable young men who may want to emulate what they might see as his glamorous routine ' , I was referring to the drugs and the casual invitation extended to a stranger .
Not to the fact of his homosexuality , " she said .
" In what is clearly a heavily orchestrated internet campaign I think it is mischievous in the extreme to suggest that my article has homophobic and bigoted undertones , " Moir added .
Later , a spokesman for the Daily Mail said : " Following the publication of advertisers ' telephone numbers by the heavily orchestrated campaign attacking Jan Moir 's column , Mail Online - of its own volition - withdrew the ads alongside her article . "
" As Jan Moir , who has gone on record supporting civil partnerships , says in her statement , this intensely choreographed campaign mischievously misrepresents her carefully argued article .
In the interest of free speech Mail Online is carrying comments both for and against her column but regrets the heavy handed tactics by the campaign which is clearly - being fanned by many people who have n't even read Jan 's views . "
Stephen Abell , the PCC deputy director , said the regulator had received 800 complaints today via phone and the internet in a couple of hours about the Moir piece , which has provoked a storm of criticism on Twitter and other social networks such as Facebook over what internet users saw as the Daily Mail writer 's insinuation that Gately 's death in a Mallorca hotel room last weekend was connected in some unspecified way to the fact that he was gay .
The PCC 's homepage was back online by about 4.30 pm , although it was loading slowly .
" It has been a bit of a flurry today , " Abell added .
Brown , who has about 124,000 Twitter followers , posted a direct link to the PCC online complaints page at about midday today .

Whether your filing system has gotten away from you or it was never really under control to begin with , you can use our handy guide to beat it back into shape .

Many people have a filing system that is largely accidental .
At some point they had more papers than they could store effectively on their desk so they started squirreling them away in cabinets , drawers , and so on .
In other cases you inherit a filing system , like with a new job , and an office packed with paperwork .
What can you do to tame your file cabinet and make it a useful storage and reference tool instead of a paper orphanage ?
You need a filing system workflow .
A filing system workflow is a road map for papers to follow as they navigate through your office .
We can't provide an exact road map for you , but by answering some of the questions below and assessing your home and office needs you 'll be able to construct an effective filing system workflow of your own .
Advertisement
Make an Assessment :
What do you want from your filing system and what does your filing system need to provide ?
Whether looking at your personal file cabinet in your home office or a bank of cabinets in your traditional office , before you do anything with your file system you need to hammer out what exactly it is that you want from the system and why you 're displeased with its current state enough to be reading a guide to beating it into shape .
Can you easily find documents ?
Is file removal and replacement easy to do or do you have to force folders back in ?
Are files within cabinets you use most frequently current and immediately necessary and useful ?
Do you have adequate space for the files you need to have on hand ?
Some issues are easily resolved .
If your difficulty in finding documents is the handwritten labels left by the previous occupant of the office you can remedy that situation with a label maker and a free afternoon .
Other issues will take a little more time to sort through , like having far too little storage space for the files at hand .
Before you put in a purchase order for ten new file cabinets however , you 'll need to do something first .

Purge Your File Cabinet :
You 've looked over your cabinets and listed some reasons why you 're not happy with them , but before you make any radical changes you need to dive in and ditch the dead weight .
There are two kinds of file cabinet purges , in one phase you shred old and unnecessary files and in the other you move necessary but old files into deep storage — deep storage can be a separate file cabinet in the basement , the records room at your office , or any place that is away from your central office .
What are candidates for the categories ?
Candidates for Shredding :
Utilities Bills -
If you have a current bill in your hand and the information on it is correct , you can shred the old ones .
Do you really need a cable bill from 2002 ?
Pay Stubs from Prior Years -
Once you receive W - 2 or other official document from your employer at the end of the year , you can ditch the pay stubs .
Bank and ATM receipts -
When you see the amount appear on your online or paper statement , there is usually no pressing need to keep these annoying little pieces of paper .
Credit Card Statements -
You can shred these , like utility bills , once you have a new one with the correct balance on it .
You may consider placing a credit card statement that has a large purchase on it like an HDTV in with the warranty information for that large purchase if your credit card has extra consumer protections that would help with replacing the larger purchase .
Advertisement
Candidates for Deep Storage :
Tax Returns -
The oft cited rule here is 7 years .
Almost all audits occur within 3 years , but who are we to risk the ire of an agency with an 8 million dollar firearms budget ?
Bank Statements - Keep bank statements for at least 3 years , most people error on the side of caution and keep them for the same 7 year span they retain tax documents .
Critical Personal Documents - Marriage licenses , birth certificates , and other difficult to replace documents should be kept in deep storage — preferably a waterproof and fireproof deep storage location .
Retirement Saving Statements - Anything related to investments , contributions to an IRA , and so on should be kept indefinitely .
Advertisement
The above example list is in no way comprehensive , but it gives you a starting point for considering the lifespan of your individual files .
If you have a fairly simple tax situation you can find tons of reference lists online regarding how long you should keep various files .
If you have any questions , we highly recommend consulting with your accountant .
Create a Workflow :
Now you 've assessed things that you would like to change about your file system — needs better labels , cabinets are poorly designed , etc. — and you 've purged files to create some room in your cabinets .
The creation of a file workflow will ensure that you 're not sitting there in a year spending a weekend beating your file system back into shape .
Your file workflow can take several shapes depending on the needs of your office and the size of the organization system you 're wrangling , but for simplicity 's sake we 're going to assume you 're not the archivist for a multinational corporation .
Advertisement
A common file workflow for a home office might look something like this :
Daily : Empty inbox and sort mail .
File or shred new documents by end of day .
Monthly :
As new bills come in , shred old statements .
Once a month take a few minutes to read over the labels in your file cabinet and determine if any files can be shifted to deep storage .
January is a critical month for being merciless about what goes to deep storage , lest you start the new year with the old year 's clutter .
Advertisement
Quarterly :
In addition to your monthly appraisal , look over your deep storage and see if any files there have outlived their usefulness .
Yearly :
Once a year you 'll be sifting through files for information related to taxes .
This is an excellent time to be brutal in your weeding .
Send old files to the shredder , cull out files related to projects that are defunct or no longer interesting .
Any old bills , receipts , and so on that are n't directly related to your taxes and somehow escaped your eye earlier in the year should be shredded .
Advertisement
Adhere to the Workflow :
You do n't lose weight by thinking about exercising and intending to eat better , and you do n't get a tight and easy to control file system by intending to finally empty your inbox and get around to sorting through your files .
If your file system is a wreck you 're going to have to spend some time beating it into shape , labeling folders , and making decisions about what to shred and what to put into deep storage .
Once you 've got the file beating out of the way , however , you 'll simply need to follow the workflow you 've set down for yourself and the documents and files will naturally find their way to where they belong and practically march themselves to the shredder when their time is up .
Using a file workflow is a habit that rewards you with an easy to use filing system and a file cabinet that wo n't creak under the weight of useless files .

U.S. deficit biggest since 1945
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
It 's officially official .
The Obama administration on Friday said the government ran a $ 1.42 trillion deficit in fiscal year 2009 .
That made it the worst year on record since World War II , according to data from the Treasury and the White House Office of Management and Budget .
Tax receipts for the year fell 16.6 % overall , while spending soared 18.2 % compared to fiscal year 2008 .
The causes : rising unemployment , the economic slowdown and the extraordinary measures taken by lawmakers to stem the economic meltdown that hit in fall 2008 .
Consequently , the annual deficit rose 212 % to the record dollar amount of $ 1.42 trillion , from $ 455 billion a year earlier .
As a share of the economy , the deficit accounted for 10 % of gross domestic product , up from 3.2 % in 2008 .
As breath - taking as that may be , it 's still not in the same stratosphere as the 1945 deficit , which hit 21 % of GDP .
Perfect deficit cocktail mix
Fiscal year 2009 , which ended Sept. 30 , had all the right ingredients for a record - breaking deficit .
While tax revenue overall took a big hit , corporate receipts led the way , falling 55 % .
Individual income tax revenue fell 20 % .
At the same time spending jumped in large part because of the various economic and financial rescue measures undertaken .
The Treasury and the OMB noted that the $ 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program and the $ 787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act , not all of which has been used , accounted for 24 % of the deficit total .
As a result , the country is very near to breaching its so - called debt ceiling , currently set at $ 12.1 trillion .
Lawmakers , however , are expected to vote to raise that ceiling this fall .
At the end of September , the country 's total debt -- which is an accumulation of all annual deficits to date plus other obligations -- stood at $ 11.9 trillion .
The long - term view
In August , the OMB projected a 10 - year deficit of $ 9 trillion , assuming President Obama 's 2010 budget proposals are put in place .
A deficit of that magnitude means the debt held by the public would approach 82 % of gross domestic product .
That 's double the 41 % recorded in 2008 .
Most budget experts blanch at the thought , especially given that the country 's fiscal future was already a source of concern before the economic crisis because of expected shortfalls over time in funding for Medicare and Social Security .
The financial and economic meltdowns of the past year have accelerated the strain on federal coffers .
So much so that now the 10 - year forecast as well as the longer - term outlook are considered unsustainable , according to deficit experts William Gale and Alan Auerbach .
In a report this week , the Government Accountability Office noted that the deficits born from the financial crisis are not the biggest crux of the problem .
" While a lot of attention has been given to the recent fiscal deterioration , the federal government faces even larger fiscal challenges that will persist long after the return of financial stability and economic growth , " the GAO said .
The GAO further cautioned that the yawning deficit problems should be addressed sooner rather than later .
" The longer action to deal with the nation 's long - term fiscal outlook is delayed , the larger the changes will need to be , increasing the likelihood that they will be disruptive and destabilizing . "
The Obama administration is promising to put a plan in place to lessen the deficit when the economy recovers .
" It was critical that we acted to bring the economy back from the brink earlier this year .
As we move from rescue to recovery , the president recognizes that we need to put the nation back on a fiscally sustainable path , " said OMB director Peter Orszag in a statement .
" As part of the FY2011 budget policy process , we are considering proposals to put our country back on firm fiscal footing . "

Cnet recently asked is the iPhone hurting AT&T ’s brand ?
The reasoning ?
Network complaints and AT&T ’s general incompetence means iPhone owners are getting terribly angry , and because iPhone is very newsworthy hardware , people report these problems with much gusto .
Quick answer , Cnet : no .
The iPhone is n’t hurting AT&T ’s brand .
The only thing hurting AT&T is AT&T .
See also : O2 and iPhone in the UK .
Again , some reports have suggested that ‘ poor little O2 ’ has somehow been suckered into taking on iPhone and that those nasty iPhone users have somehow made the wonderful O2 look rubbish .
O2 may have been taken by surprise with high data usage , but to blame Apple or its hardware for O2 ’s shortcomings is just stupid .
Man , sooner or later , people will look at something wonderful like BBC ’s iPlayer and somehow suggest that the BBC is somehow at fault for making lots of shoddy ISPs look like the idiots that they are , due to not being able to cope with the traffic the fantastic iPlayer creates .
Oh , right — that ’s already happened too .
What states other than New Jersey do not allow customers to pump their own gas at gas stations ?
The Answer :
New Jersey and Oregon are the only U.S. states that currently ban self - service gas stations .
The purpose of these laws was to protect consumers and gas station owners from costly , and possibly deadly , accidents .
Better education and improved technology , however , have made pumping gas much safer and easier for consumers over the last 50 years .
Since the 1970s , self - service gas stations have grown in popularity .
The New Jersey law was enacted in 1949 and the Oregon law in 1951 .
Each statute has stood up to several challenges in those two states .
Disabled motorists are most interested in seeing such laws survive .
For those motorists with a disability , pumping gas is not an option and they depend on the employees of full - service stations .
Despite requirements outlined in the Americans with Disabilities Act , many self - service stations do not provide a full - service option for disabled drivers , nor provide those services at self - service rates .
- The Editors
Consider the farm - fresh egg , the pristine symbol of the simple days of pre-industrial farming .
People love them , but there 's a problem :
They seem to be getting harder to peel .
And though I 've messily discovered this on my own , there 's some science to back this idea up .
Here in food - crazed San Francisco , fresh eggs are everywhere .
After purchasing some of these just - collected treasures for hard boiling , I found it nearly impossible to peel off their shells without pockmarking them .
My once - beautiful eggs ended up with more craters than the moon .
It could n't be my fault , I told myself .
I 'd been hard - boiling eggs for decades , most intensively during a six - month egg - salad kick in ninth grade .
I got my technique down and everything .
What happened , then ?
As an egg ages , it loses some carbon dioxide through tiny pores in the shell , making the egg white more basic .
At the same time , it loses moisture , which increases the size of the " air cell " at the bottom of the shell , between the inner and outer membranes .
The dynamics of this process are , in the words of a University of California , Davis agriculture publication , " not completely understood , " but the combination of these changes makes an old egg a lot easier to peel than a one that is fresh out of the bird .
" The best guarantee of easy peeling is to use old eggs ! " wrote Harold McGee , in his monster 800 - page tome , On Food and Cooking : The Science and Lore of the Kitchen .
" Difficult peeling is characteristic of fresh eggs with a relatively low albumen pH , which somehow causes the albumen to adhere to the inner shell membrane more strongly than it coheres to itself . "
The USDA provides a complementary explanation more focused on the air cell , which you can see in the schematic , sitting between the outer and inner shell membranes .
" As the contents of the egg contracts and the air cell enlarges , the shell becomes easier to peel , " the USDA Shell Eggs from Farm to Table fact sheet states .
" For this reason , older eggs make better candidates for hard cooking , "
McGee also suggests an easy cooking chemistry solution .
" If you end up with a carton of very fresh eggs and need to cook them right away , you can add a half teaspoon of baking soda to a quart of water to make the cooking water alkaline ( though this intensifies the sulfury flavor ) , " he wrote .
While I 've noticed the Peeling Problem most distinctly with superfresh farm eggs , the eggs you buy at the supermarket could be getting fresher too .
Most American eggs are produced and distributed by agribusiness concerns like Cal - Maine and Rose Acre , which each have more than 20 million hens cranking out eggs just for you .
Statistics on the time it takes for an egg to go from hen to supermarket have not been calculated , a USDA representative told Wired.com , but there 's some reason to believe that new production techniques could be delivering eggs to markets faster .
A 1998 report by the agency found that big consolidated chicken egg facilities , which wash and package the eggs on - site instead of sending them to a separate processing location , could reduce the time from farm to store from 100 hours to 53 hours .
And , according to Cal - Maine 's SEC filings , the industry continues to centralize , squeezing out the old facilities in favor of the new ones .
Eggs tend to sit on the retail shelf longer than they spend in processing and distribution , so the few extra days of freshness might not make the eggs as dramatically hard to peel as farm eggs .
But if you have any trouble , consider another technofix : automatic Eggstractor egg peeler , anyone ?

Viruses such as HIV and influenza take safe harbor in cells , where they cannot be recognized directly by the immune system .
The immune response relies on infected cells announcing the presence of the virus by studding their exterior with fragments of the virus lurking within .
Viruses such as HIV and influenza take safe harbor in cells , where they cannot be recognized directly by the immune system .
The immune response relies on infected cells announcing the presence of the virus by studding their exterior with fragments of the virus lurking within .
This system , called the " major histocompatibility complex " or MHC , is found in all mammalian immune systems .
Although MHC genes are complicated , variable and difficult to read , a good " map " of the genes would help biologists understand why individuals have different responses to viruses .
Variations in the MHC genes could be key to some of medicine 's best - kept secrets : why some rare " non-progressors " do not get AIDS despite long - term infection with HIV , why some people respond poorly to vaccines , and how best to harness the immune response to defeat viruses .
Now , in a study published today ( Oct. 11 ) in Nature Medicine , a team of researchers at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center at the University of Wisconsin - Madison have shown a high - speed method for analyzing the stubbornly complex MHC genes in three species of monkeys .
" We have an abiding interest in the genes that are involved in immunity to pathogens , " says David O'Connor , the study 's senior author and deputy director of the primate center .
" People around the world , like other mammals , have encountered pathogens that have shaped the genes that control their immune systems .
These genes are highly variable , and have been very difficult to study with conventional methods . "
The new study used " 454 parallel sequencing , " which is typically used to create a highly detailed , " deep " genome sequence of individual organisms .
The Wisconsin team tweaked this technology .
Instead of attaining the greatest detail on a small number of individuals , they sacrificed a bit of accuracy to look at hundreds of samples from macaque monkeys , animals that are widely used in immunology research .
They found that each monkey expresses more than two dozen MHC genes , at least four times the number in humans .
The genes varied greatly , reflecting each individual 's geographic origin and the history of infection among its ancestors .
The sequencing was performed in collaboration with researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign , and the instrument maker , 454 Life Sciences , a division of Roche .
" This study shows the tremendous potential of 454 sequencing to fundamentally change the way we study MHC genetics in human disease research , " says Michael Egholm , chief technology officer and vice president of research and development at 454 Life Sciences .
Because variations in MHC plays such a key role in immunity , the new ability to " read " the structure of MHC genes should improve the efficiency of animal research , says Roger Wiseman , a geneticist and the study 's lead author .
" This will allow us to select better groups of animals for vaccine trials , perhaps allowing for fewer animals to be used in each study . "
The high - speed sequencing technology " can be used to look at any highly variable gene in large numbers of samples simultaneously , " adds O'Connor , whose laboratory has started using the technology to study immune responses and drug resistance in HIV / AIDS patients , correlating genetics with different responses to the virus .
" We think this will help us understand why some people do much better than others .
The global diversity of HIV and the MHC genes of infected people are complex and expensive to study . "
" This idea of looking for drug - resistant mutations has already been applied to single patients , " adds Wiseman , who is also in UW - Madison 's Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine .
" We can now do this more economically on much larger groups of patients , which would be particularly useful in developing countries , where drug - resistance tests are seldom affordable . "
The United Nations just reported that about 4 million people in the developing world are taking anti-retroviral medicines for HIV .
Another application for rapid sequencing could be to screen potential donors for bone - marrow transplants , says Wiseman .
" It 's a bit down the road , but this could be used to tissue - type hundreds or thousands of individuals , maybe even an entire donor registry , in one fell swoop , and it could be faster , more thorough and less expensive than conventional techniques .
This could produce better treatment outcomes by ensuring better tissue matches . "

( CNN ) -- Millions of Californians will duck for cover Thursday morning in one of the largest earthquake drills in the world .
Elementary school students in Burbank , California , take part in last year 's earthquake drill .
" The Great California Shakeout " will kick off at 10:15 a.m. at schools , museums , fire stations and other sites across the state .
More than 6 million people have registered to take part in the drill , sponsored by various state agencies .
About 5.5 million Californians participated in last year 's drill , organizers said .
iReport.com :
Are you taking part in California 's earthquake drill ?
Senior citizens at the Vallecito Mobile Home Park in Ventura County were among last year 's participants .
They took cover for three minutes and some pretended to be injured so emergency workers could practice safety procedures .
This year 's participants also can watch an animated video that shows how much damage a magnitude 7.8 earthquake can cause .

Amy Winehouse and her father Mitch have reportedly begun approaching perfume manufacturers with the idea of creating a scent inspired by the singer .
The ' Valerie ' star , who recently returned to the UK from an eight - month holiday in St. Lucia , is thought to have already rejected a Â £ 500,000 deal .
Speaking to the Daily Star , an insider said : " They want it to reflect her style with a classic smoky 1950s look and smell .
" Amy is keen to expand her brand and wants to latch on to the celeb perfumes bandwagon while she can .
They know her fans love to copy her style , and her trademark fashion and beehive hair - do were last yearâ€™s must - have look .â€ 
However , the source added that some companies are unhappy with Winehouse 's alleged reluctance to promote the product , saying : " Frankly , she doesnâ€™t look like she smells that nice , so doing some positive publicity to prove it doesnâ€™t just smell of stale booze and fags would be vital . "
Other celebrities to have recently launched successful fragrances include Britney Spears , Jennifer Lopez , Kylie Minogue and Sarah Jessica Parker .

Welcome to “ The Right Talk ” , The Online Talk Show where The Right Hand Path speaks to Celebrities from the world of Metal music .
Our Celebrity Guest today is Vijay Prozak , the Founder & Owner , of the USA - based “ American Nihilist Underground Society [ A.N.U.S. ] ” in this Exclusive Interview to an Online Magazine from India dedicated to Metal Music .
The Right Hand Path : Greetings from India !
How are you ?
Vijay Prozak : Greetings from Texas .
Doing great here , glad to be doing this interview .
You have quite the professional website and writing style .
Hail to India , land of conquerors !
The Right Hand Path : On the A.N.U.S. website you ’ve talked about the genesis of the name , anus being , for you , in your words “ the dark side of the mouth ” .
I do n’t know how many people would be aware of this but A.N.U.S. was one of the earliest websites on the Internet with regard to Metal , you started the website in 1987 when the Internet was at a nascent stage and was n’t all over the world .
What was your inspiration behind A.N.U.S. then ?
Is it a “ For Profit ” or “ Not For Profit ” organization ?
Please tell us what A.N.U.S as an organization means to you , its creation , your views and understanding of Nihilism .
Vijay Prozak :
Most people are not aware that we started out writing articles on bulletin boards , posting them to the then - nascent Internet ( via FIDOnet ) in the middle 1980s .
We later went on to the internet at large and finally the web , writing about metal and philosophy .
Now we ’re in our 21st year of publication and writing about metal , philosophy , religion and classical music .
It has been a great journey , not only for me as a learner and writer , but with luck , for those who read us , too .
The inspiration behind ANUS was a revelation I had early in life , when alone in a forest , about how reality was constructed and the human response to it .
I was at the time already aware that civilization was in decline , at least in the West , and horrified by how adults behaved and how reality was denied .
To me , reality is a source of reverent awe and respect ; it seemed to me that , in an effort to run away from death , adults were denying all of the cool parts of reality and living in an artificial , consensual , social reality that belongs to the world of “ appearance ” but not the underlying reality , which is a series of cause / effect relationships that are mathematical more than material , and I call it “ structure . ”
The ancient Hindus referred to appearance as the Veil of Maya ; Plato alluded to it in his cave allegory ; even Jesus Christ pointed out that to really know life is to escape the self , and escape the selves of others , and look into how reality works as a process .
I love life and want to always bring out what ’s greatest in it , but fear we as a species are off - course and would like to correct that so the good times can roll again .
Since that time , I ’ve found vectors of truth — philosophy , death metal , religion , classical music — that inherently understand both the nature of reality and the Romantic spirit that one has to have , both “ amor fati ” and a reverence for the cosmos .
I write about these because the way the cards fell this time , I ended up being a words guy and not a musician , martial artist or sculptor .
ANUS is the organization that supports the expressions of these truths , and it is not a for - profit endeavor , in fact quite the opposite : we could ’ve made a lot more money running a porn site at anus.com and telling people things to affirm their apathy , cynicism , bitterness , ironic disdain , resentment and so on .
But profit is best derived from things that benefit people , as that way not only does one feel better about oneself , but one ’s audience does not self - destruct !
Nihilism is to me a gateway to all philosophy .
It is the rejection of inherent value : there is no sign or voice of the universe that tells us what to do .
There is only a reality that consistently rewards certain behaviors and does n’t reward others .
So our fundamental statement of nihilism is that instead of picking up on some form of “ knowing , ” as Nietzsche calls our human conceit of imposing anthropomorphic reality onto nature , we should study life — study reality , and the cosmos — and from that derive our wisdom .
In essence , what ’s here is here because it has worked for millions of years and beyond , and so we should view it as a superior order and try to understand it instead of “ judging ” it and coming up with our own preferred , false , social and emotional reality .
Nihilism conflates directly to Hindu reverence , Christian piety , a Zen master ’s slap , Islamic submission and Buddhist selfless mindfulness .
It is an eternal truth known to all who study .
Nihilism is also a rejection of the false artifacts of a dying society .
When people tell us there are absolute Truths , what they mean is that they want to impose their own thoughts and ideas upon us under the guise of being truths in nature , when really truth is a human conception — reality is consistent , and we can describe it and label some of those descriptions as “ true , ” but those are approximations and we have to be careful to not let the message replace what it describes .
We need truth , as a concept , but we can abuse it easily by looking at the effects of a chain of events , or our personal perspective or judgment of it , and claiming that it is the cause of that chain of events when really it is the effect and appearance , not the underlying structure .
Growing up in the West in its decadent phase , we find many false truths floating around us — and these have their root in bad psychological pathologies that others have , which manifest themselves in unhealthy lifestyles justified by false mental concepts .
These ideas are shot through metal music and its lyrics , the interviews given by its performers , and the ideology it espouses , which in turn is derived from modern re-incarnations of ideas from European Romantic art of the 18th century C.E.
I consider nihilism the way to get outside the bad psychology , re-connect with a love of life , and start moving toward a more rational future .
This idea I call “ futurist traditionalism , ” although sometimes I like the term “ eternalism ” because these ideas will be true in any and every century because they are derivations from the mathematical implications of the condition of life itself , and are not moderated by technology , politics or fashion .
The Right Hand Path :
You are also known as Spinoza Ray Prozak , it is said on the Internet that after your conversion to the Continuity Movement you adopted the name “ Vijay ” and from then on you ’re known as Vijay Prozak .
What do you ’ve to say about this ?
Vijay Prozak : I adopted the first name “ Vijay ” after an Indian friend of mine I had when growing up and very young .
He was a good dude .
I wanted the new name to reflect my conversion to Hinduism , which I consider the original religion and the most philosophically sensible view to take of life , especially Advaita Vedanta , which is a philosophy I always had but was grateful to discover others had written down so I had words to use with others about it .
“ Spinoza Ray Prozak ” was a name I used on a radio program of underground death metal and black metal that I hosted for six years in Los Angeles , from 1992 - 1998 , during the latter half of the formative years of the metal underground .
The Continuity Movement is a fusion of Schopenhauer , Nietzsche , my own thought and that of the ancient Hindus .
As per the Bhagavad - Gita , all religions are attempts to describe the same reality , and so should be viewed as tributaries of the river of Hinduism ; to my mind , the Continuity Movement is a modern statement of the basics of these ideas and an attempt to bring clarity to a time full of many words but few that describe any useful sense of organization or mental clarity .
I want to make it clear to people that these ideas have been discovered in every era , and have been true in every era , but also emphasize the importance of Hindu learning : it ’s ancient , it ’s still valid , and it ’s entirely consistent with the European pagan tradition and Greco - Roman polytheism .
It ’s also the one religious philosophy that ’s coherent with science in its raw form .
The Right Hand Path :
You ’ve been a Death Metal / Black Metal DJ ; please share your experiences from your DJ days and your view of Metal Music when you were first introduced to it and the current Metal Music scenario .
Vijay Prozak : I grew up in a house where classical music was the norm , and when I was trying to listen to rock music , I found most of it really repetitive , melodically crippled , and basically variations on rhythm within a pre-defined , spoon - fed harmonic space .
When I found heavy metal , I immediately liked it for its assertive , warlike , healthy spirit .
I did n’t want more music about self - pity or pitying others , or being hopelessly in love and thus helplessly lost in life .
I like music and art about going out there , accepting the bad and making something great of it ; this is the story of life , and it is told in infinite forms , like looking through the cuts of a diamond at light .
You seem many forms of a truth , but that truth exists elsewhere , and not in tangible form .
Heavy metal had this kind of vision with its epic songs and acceptance of death .
I got into heavy metal through thrash , which is a crossover genre of metal and punk best seen in bands like the Dirty Rotten Imbeciles ( DRI ) and Cryptic Slaughter .
From them , I got into AC / DC and Metallica , and then one day found Slayer , and thought , “ this is the voice of sound I have always been looking for . ”
From then on , it was Massacra , Morbid Angel , Deicide , Sepultura , Master , Sarcofago , Destruction , Kreator and Prong .
I wanted more and kept exploring .
At some point , the chance for me to do a radio show came my way and I really had to face some fears .
I was n’t a bold kid , or a popular one ; on the contrary , I was ( and am , haha ) both a computer nerd and book - loving , forest - hiking kind of dude .
The thought of public speaking made me somewhat nervous , as did the idea of being on the radio .
But no one else was going to do it and this music was amazing , so I signed up first and figured out how to face those fears later .
A year later , I looked back on all those old fears and laughed .
They were nothing , but introducing people to this music and keeping it alive , that was everything !
The show that I hosted ran for six years , from the formative days of the underground ( 1992 , with a apprenticeship in 1991 ) until the underground had lost its real momentum .
By 1994 , death metal was played out , although some of the older bands kept going in healthy form ; by 1996 , black metal was played out .
Those were the real glory days of American and European black metal and death metal , and those genres have never recovered .
In other parts of the world , that is not so : people are rediscovering these genres daily .
If I had one wish , it would be for them to find the classics first and worry about what ’s trendy later .
The original death metal and black metal were whole concepts , where music was united with idea and image , like an ancient Greek play where words were sung to music as a warlike drama was acted out .
People since then have been choosing the parts of this concept at random , and trying to mix them with rap , rock and punk , which results in reversion to a mean — it makes metal - flavored rock or punk , but loses what made this metal great .
What appealed to me about black metal and death metal was that they resemble classical music in how phrases are put together .
Phrases are like melodies , but I use the term phrase because they are often chromatic , use rhythm and the difference between tones to create a shape of motion in the music .
With death metal , they are put together in an order that narrates a journey , so that a riff salad of a dozen riffs and variations expands upon a concept with each new riff or repetition of the old .
It ’s not like the entirely cyclic compositional style of rock music ; rock musicians misunderstand death metal and black metal because they try to understand them in a rock context , where shifts in harmony define the music .
In metal , changes in phrase and the way phrases complement each other in a primitive kind of counterpoint , not harmony , defines the development of the music .
The narrative style this produces is like classical music , although classical musicians misunderstand it because it does n’t adhere to known classical forms ( like “ Sonata ” or “ Fugue ” ) .
This tendency is the essence of death metal ( and black metal ) because it provides a whole concept .
Instead of focusing on the material exterior , it ’s a “ going within ” — instead of changing harmony for effect , change the shape of melody — that demands a more complex view than a cycle between opposite extremes .
In this style , form and content are inherently linked and cannot be deconstructed and made arbitrary .
Even more , it is an emulation of the process of life itself instead of an imposition of an artificial category ( harmony ) that has a single point of organization ( geometry ) which makes all other aspects of it arbitrary .
As a result , it ’s not surprising that death metal and black metal are naturalistic , meaning that they accept and embrace all the scary , “ heavy ” ( meaning : of deep possibly threatening meaning ) parts of life and convert that morbid outlook into an assertive , constructive and positive view — they make life a place we can accept , and find appealing , and want to participate in so we can fight it out and make it better .
A good novel will do this too ; someone once said that Blade Runner and Neuromancer make future dystopias that we want to experience so we can go in there and fix them .
It ’s not surprising to me that black metal and death metal borrow so much from literature , especially Romantic literature , because they have this outlook .
Like certain religious truths , the Romantic outlook is eternal and has been discovered in different forms through the ages by many different people .
Death metal and black metal reject a dying society and look to nature and death to find the truth of existence , and by doing so , get over the neurotic fear and materialistic individualism that define modern society .
The Right Hand Path : Continuing from here I must say the Metal Music section of A.N.U.S. has been a treasure trove of information for me with regards to information about Metal , its myriad sub - genres ; it ’s like an Encyclopedia of Metal Music .
Do you think there is a connection between Nihilism and Metal Music ?
If yes , what ’s the reason ?
Vijay Prozak : Thank you for reading .
The only reason we keep writing is because people like you read … in fact , that ’s why we started it .
During the 1980s , there used to be a type of wide - open system — like a 4 chan for its day — called the Metal AE ( 201-879-6668 ) .
I started posting metal articles on there and got a very positive response , so have kept doing it to this day .
The goal of the Dark Legions Archive , which is the metal - related parts of the ANUS , is to promote the underground death metal and black metal that has shaped the genre and delivers top - quality music .
Life is short ; listen to the best .
We do n’t do it to appear cool , or to be trendy , or to be anti-trendy , but simply out of a love for the music and the feelings and ideas it stirs up .
To love something is to hate and fear what destroys it , so our commentary is often judgmental of boring , repetitive , pointless or disorganized music .
As far as the connection between nihilism and metal music , it ’s absolutely there — but most musicians are not readers of philosophy , so are n’t going to spot it .
The “ heavy ” in heavy metal goes back to Black Sabbath , who in 1969 were surrounded by hippies making music about how love and empathy would save us from the machine , and they saw this as a simplistic , insincere , manipulative viewpoint much like most interpretations of religion .
To counter it , they made music styled after horror movies ; in horror movies , humans must confront some evil that society cannot recognize and combat , and must find ways outside of accepted means of beating it .
Horror movies , like metal genres , have very clearly defined conventions .
While I ’m not a horror movie fanatic , I can appreciate them ( and martial arts movies , and that ’s about it from the video side of things ) for telling a clear truth : the real threat we face is our own inability to find reality and act on it , and a disaster or honest struggle re-awakens the part of us that ’s not asleep in the dream of social reality , and lets us know our true selves and so builds up an honest self - confidence that society can never create .
Without struggle , we do not know who we are .
Metal by showing us the “ heavy ” forced us to confront a reality outside the social consensual reality , where marketing and politeness gloss over death and horror , and show us instead positive effects if we just sign on for some unrelated product or idea .
Metal shows us a nihilistic world where the cosmos does not care if we die , cute bunnies get killed by hungry wolves , and our deaths are inevitable — and then shows us that the only way to live in this world is to rage with it , to struggle for something better than what ’s here now , and through this constructive fighting for something worth dying for , to know ourselves and be confident in ourselves without relying on hollow praise for others .
This to me is the essence of nihilism .
Nietzsche defines nihilism as a lack of ability to believe in anything ; I define nihilism as a belief in nothingness , and a recognition that there is no “ writing on the wall ” or inherent absolute truth , only a universe in which we can make a lot of our lives , or freak out because of death and become ninnies hiding behind television screens .
Metal is entirely coherent with this nihilism , and even makes its allegiance explicit with statements like “ Only death is real ” and “ Death is certain , life is not . ”
We can not shut out the heavy and only pay attention to the happy bunnies ; we must praise both wolf and bunny , mouth and anus , life and death — and revere the process of nature that , through putting positive and negative together in a cycle , gives us the chance to have consciousness and intelligence at all .
In popular music , heavy metal ( and death metal , and black metal ) is the only outlet for such views .
Punk got sold off into politics and found out that you can please a crowd with dogma just as much as with the anti-dogma bourgeois spacing out that punk railed against ; rock music has always been a scam , invented mainly from European folk music dumbed down and made standard through six - note scales and simplified song forms .
People growing up in this society need a source of not canned truth , but a gateway to realism , and metal music is it .
Nihilism is an abstraction of the same impulse .
From the beginning , people have opposed our nihilism and metal connection .
There ’s a huge group of people who want to believe that metal is n’t art and does n’t have values .
They want you to think that it ’s all appearance , and that drinking beer , wearing jean jackets covered with patches , telling authority figures to fuck off and buying lots of CD - shaped products is metal ; I think that ’s disrespectful to all the musicians who cared enough to put their ideas down in song form .
Metal is a culture .
Nihilism is its philosophy .
The Right Hand Path : Talking about Metal Music , A.N.U.S. runs a number of sites like Heidenlarm , mock Him Productions , Death Metal , Dark Legions , A.N.U.S. Metal Radio , and Gay Christ Records to name a few with regards to Metal Music .
What ’s the inspiration and motive behind owning and operating these many sites on Metal Music ?
To me it sounds like a business strategy wherein a number of companies are created to provide what is known as a “ 360° Degree Experience / Effect ” which is like a move to strangulate / suffocate the competition and garner more [ market ] share .
Is there a particular goal that you want to achieve with each of these sites ?
Vijay Prozak : Business is interesting to me because its patterns are similar to those of nature itself .
We can see business and economics as a reflection of individual impulses , and the demographic / statistical - level changes they produce .
In that sense , ANUS was a business idea , even if we had no intention of making money from it ( and never have ) .
I like your description of it , and it ’s similar to what we are trying to do , except that we have no intention of suffocating our competition .
What we want to do instead is present many different views of the same truth .
Also , over the years , opportunities have arisen and we ’ve had fun making our versions of them :
• Heidenlarm was an attempt to bring back the spirit of 1980s text files about metal , which would be uploaded on “ sites ” like the Metal AE and provide metal reviews , information , lyrics and histories at a time when such things were rare , hard to come by , and ignored by the mainstream press — which was the only option outside slow postal fanzines at the time .
• The Dark Legions Archive is an attempt to chronicle the music of the underground in a style inspired by Joan Didion and other popular culture writers who found , in the new musics emerging , shadows of the past which implied that history not only repeats itself , but connected patterns were repeating and could be observed .
• mock Him productions was the name for our organization before ANUS really took over .
We liked the idea , inspired mostly by Impaled Nazarene and Havohej , of out - of - the - closet blasphemy .
Even though I recognize that truth comes from many sources , including Buddha and Christ , I ’m not the world ’s biggest fan of either religion in its raw form , although if interpreted in an “ Advaita Vedanta context ” both religions are fairly neat and seem to corroborate each other .
• ANUS metal radio was an attempt to recapture what I ’d done on the airwaves in the early 1990s .
It ’s hard to seize the spirit of that time , before MP3s , popular internet , and thousands of metal bands vying for attention .
• Gay Christ Records brought to light the “ dub trading ” days of metal , when people would mail around tapes with dubbed recordings and ad hoc compilations as a means of spreading new bands and bringing forgotten treasures to light .
Metal music faces tough times ahead .
At 30 years old this year , it has gone through a boom - bust cycle where someone comes up with a good idea , then a ton of people rush in to “ participate ” and dilute the idea because they do n’t care about it , but are using it as a means to advance their personal agendas .
That in turn causes quality of the music to fall , which warns off quality musicians because who wants to try to compete in a genre where people can’t tell the difference between crap trend of the month , and something eternally beautiful and powerful ?
If you had to summarize our story , it would be this : a small group of people find beauty in the world , and decide to spread the moment before the realization of that beauty , in meme form , throughout the world .
It ’s like a riff — you return to the place right before the place where you started , so there ’s always a forward momentum .
The Right Hand Path :
It ’s been a pleasure speaking to you Prozak .
What would you like to say to the readers of The Right Hand Path ?
Vijay Prozak : The Right Hand Path is a step in the right direction for metal journalism and metal .
Keep reading .
If you find something great in life , not only “ never let go ” but also , help it along .
None of us created ourselves ; we were all helped along .
The cosmos contains an eternal divine order that rewards the good and loves a good , complex , rippin ’ metal tune .
Thank you for reading this interview , and thank you , V. Ganesh of The Right Hand Path , for asking these interesting questions .
Well , in less than a month it will be National Novel Writing Month ( NaNoWriMo ) .
Are you ready ?
I ’m not ready yet , and I have n’t even decided yet if I ’m participating .
It might be a game time decision .
That said , I did “ win ” NaNoWriMo the last two years , so I figured I ’d share what I ’ve learned with all of you who are going to participate .
Plus , writing this just might push me in the direction of participation .
My NaNoWriMo Advice
Math Matters – 50,000 words in 30 days .
That means you need to average 1,667 words a day .
Write less on one day and you have to make it up on another .
It really is that simple .
Calendar Matters –
No go get a calendar and turn to November .
Anything jump out ?
Thanksgiving ?
Are you really going to write 1,667 words that day ?
If not , adjust your words / day count ( it ’s 1,724 words per day if you count on 0 for Thanksgiving Day ) .
Be realistic with yourself .
If you do n’t think you will be as productive on weekends , adjust your word per day count accordingly .
Start STRONG – Use that opening day momentum and write as many words as you can on the first day of NaNoWriMo .
This will give you a bit of cushion for those days when inspiration is n’t there or you are just too busy to write .
Do n’t fall behind –
Do not go to bed without hitting your word count for the day .
You fall behind a bit one day , and you will just have that much more to write the next .
Planning helps – I ’m not much of a planner or outliner , but the more planning you do this month , the easier it will be to write next month .
Put it this way , if you are planning in November , you are taking time away from writing .
You are writing draft 1 – Do n’t worry about getting things perfect .
You wo n’t .
Just remember the point is to get a first draft down on paper / ones and zeros .
Editing can happen another month .
Have fun with the community –
There are thousands of people taking part in NaNoWriMo .
Befriend a few of them and keep each other honest .
This is key for those who have trouble with self - motivation .
Have fun with the writing – 50,000 words is a challenge , and it can be quite torturous .
Still , have fun with it .
Caffeine !
Stick to those points and I think you have a shot at being successful in November .
Anybody have anything to add ?
The SuperFreakonomics Global - Warming Fact Quiz
By the time you finish this blog post , you will understand why we differ from our critics in our conclusions .
As we write in SuperFreakonomics , there are many misconceptions about the facts surrounding global warming .
Take the following true / false quiz to test your knowledge of the science , economics , and technology of global warming .
Global - warming science questions :
1 . The Earth has gotten substantially warmer over the past 100 years .
TRUE / FALSE
2 . Even if we were to immediately and permanently stabilize our carbon emissions at the current levels , or even cut these emissions substantially , climate models predict that Earth will continue to get warmer for decades .
TRUE / FALSE
3 . When Mt. Pinatubo erupted in 1991 , it spewed millions of tons of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere .
Scientists believe that the haze generated by the eruption reflected some of the Sun ’s light , causing the Earth ’s temperature to temporarily drop as a consequence .
TRUE / FALSE
4 . Because the half - life of sulfur dioxide in the stratosphere is relatively short ( on the order of one year ) , the cooling effects of the Mt. Pinatubo eruption faded within a few years .
TRUE / FALSE
5 . Dark surfaces absorb more sunlight than light surfaces .
Thus , all else equal , light surfaces cause less global warming because more of the sunlight that strikes these surfaces is reflected back into space .
TRUE / FALSE
6 . Clouds , which are white or gray , are lighter in color than the oceans , which are blue .
TRUE / FALSE
The correct answer to all six of these questions , we believe , is “ TRUE . ”
You can see our chapter on global warming ( pp. 165-209 ) and particularly the endnotes ( pp. 247-256 ) for citations and elaboration .
It is our impression that none of the six scientific statements above is at all controversial among climate scientists .
I do not believe that any of our global - warming critics would quibble with any of these facts .
And just to be perfectly clear , despite all the bluster that has surrounded our chapter on global warming , these are the six scientific facts that are critical to our analysis of geo-engineering in that chapter , a point I will expand upon below .
We document many other interesting facts in the chapter , but these are the only ones that are central to our argument .
It is simply not the case that criticisms of the geo-engineering solutions that we highlight in the chapter arise because we get the scientific facts wrong , unless the critics think that any of the six statements above are false .
So let ’s move on to the economic issues surrounding global warming , and let ’s see if that is where we differ from the critics in our assumptions .
Global warming economics questions :
1 . If the Earth ’s warming leads to global catastrophe , that would be a really bad outcome .
TRUE / FALSE
2 . Even when there is enormous uncertainty about the likelihood of future cataclysms , it makes sense to invest now in finding ways to avoid such cataclysms .
TRUE / FALSE
3. Economists estimate that the costs of reducing carbon emissions are likely to be upwards of $ 1 trillion per year .
TRUE / FALSE
The correct answer to all three of these economic questions is “ TRUE . ”
These are the three key economic facts that are critical to the arguments in our chapter .
The first question does n’t require any further explanation .
The answer to the second question has been hammered home by Martin Weitzman ‘s work in the area , which we cite in SuperFreakonomics , as well as a newer paper that Weitzman has written .
The third fact is based on the analysis of Nicholas Stern .
These cost estimates are obviously highly speculative , but the true cost of reducing carbon emissions is likely to be within two orders of magnitude of this number .
As far as I know , none of our critics would disagree with any of these three economic facts about global warming .
Indeed , Paul Krugman ‘s attack of our chapter largely focuses on the misconception that we do not agree with fact No. 2 , when clearly we do .
Somehow Krugman has come to the conclusion that we are in favor of inaction , missing the main point of the chapter , which is that we think immediate and aggressive action is warranted , in the form of investment in ( or implementation of ) geoengineering solutions .
Perhaps Krugman does not consider those steps taking action .
So if there is no disagreement on either the six key scientific facts or the three key economic facts , where is the disagreement coming from ?
Perhaps it is coming from a lack of agreement over technological facts .
Global warming technological questions :
1 . There exists an engineering design that provides a means of delivering enough sulfur dioxide to the stratosphere on a continuous basis to effectively cool the Earth .
The estimated cost of building and implementing this technology is a few hundred million dollars .
TRUE / FALSE
2 . There exists an engineering design that provides a means of increasing oceanic cloud cover by seeding such clouds with salt - water that is sprayed into the air by a fleet of solar powered dinghies .
The estimated cost of building and implementing this technology is a few hundred million dollars .
TRUE / FALSE
The answer to these questions is once again “ TRUE . ”
As we describe in SuperFreakonomics , the Seattle - based company Intellectual Ventures has designs for both a “ stratoshield ” ( No. 1 ) and the cloud - seeding project ( No. 2 ) .
I do n’t see how the critics could argue with the answers to those two questions .
They might argue that the technology wo n’t work as Intellectual Ventures hopes it will , but there is no arguing with the fact that Intellectual Ventures has the blueprints to try to build these contraptions , and could have them up and working within a year or two .
With all of this as preamble , let ’s get to the fundamental question we try to answer in the chapter :
If we need to cool the Earth in a hurry , what is the best way to do it ?
Our answer to that question follows directly from the three sets of facts I presented above .
Reducing carbon emissions is not a great way of cooling the Earth in a hurry for two key reasons : ( 1 ) even if we cut carbon emissions today , the Earth will continue warming for decades ; and ( 2 ) reducing carbon emissions is expensive , with a price tag of at least $ 1 trillion per year .
( There is a third problem with reducing carbon emissions , which is that it requires worldwide behavioral change , which will be hard to achieve .
But even beyond that , carbon mitigation is not a great solution to the question posed above .
There might be other significant benefits tor reducing carbon emissions — addressing ocean acidification , for instance . )
A much better approach , we conclude , is geoengineering .
The scientific evidence suggests that either the stratoshield or increased oceanic clouds would have a large and immediate impact on cooling the Earth , unlike carbon - emission reductions .
The cost of these solutions is trivial compared to the cost of lowering carbon emissions — literally thousands of times cheaper !
Perhaps best of all , if something goes wrong and we decide we do n’t like the results of the stratoshield or the oceanic clouds , we can stop the programs immediately and any effects will quickly disappear .
These two geo-engineering solutions are completely reversible .
Given the huge costs of global cataclysm and how cheap the solut
ions are , it would be crazy not to move forward with geoengineering research in order to have these solutions ready to go in case we decide we need to cool the Earth .
Why then , are our our conclusions so radically different from those of our critics ?
The answer :
We are answering a different question than our critics .
Our question , at noted above , is what is the cheapest , fastest way to quickly cool the Earth .
Like every question we tackle in Freakonomics and SuperFreakonomics , we approach the question like economists , using data and logic to conclude that the answer to that question is geo-engineering .
Not coincidentally , almost every economist who has asked the same question has come to the same conclusion , including Martin Weitzman and the economists at the Copenhagen Consensus .
But that is not the question that Al Gore and the climate scientists are trying to answer .
The sorts of questions they tend to ask are “ What is the ‘ right ’ amount of carbon to emit ? ” or “ Is it moral for this generation to put carbon into the air when future generations will pay the price ? ” or “ What are the responsibilities of humankind to the planet ? ”
Unlike the question that we are asking —
How can we most efficiently cool the Earth fast ? — the types of questions that environmentalists are trying to answer mix together both scientific issues and moral / ethical issues .
If you have any doubts about this , watch Al Gore ’s movie , in which he says explicitly that reducing carbon emissions is not a political issue , but a moral issue .
That is why someone like Ken Caldeira can agree with the facts presented in our chapter , say that the chapter is written in good faith , but still disagree with the conclusion that geoengineering is the answer .
It is because the question Ken Caldeira is trying to answer is not the question we are trying to answer .
The same is true of our critics .
But instead of just making this simple point — that we are asking different questions — the critics have either intentionally or unintentionally confused the issues by making all sorts of extraneous arguments .
I do not mean to imply that the question we answer in the book is the most important question .
It may be that the questions that environmentalists are trying to ask are more important and more interesting , but that certainly does not mean that we do n’t want to know the answer to our question , a question that the environmentalists do n’t bother to ask very often because they are focused on their more philosophical questions .
So for all the blogosphere shouting against our chapter , I have to be honest and say that I just do n’t get it .
I ca n’t understand why any environmentalist who really cares about the Earth ’s future could say with a straight face that geoengineering does n’t deserve a seat at the table as the global - warming debate heats up .
Students Hit With $ 15 Fine For Using Cell Phones in School One Texas school district took in $ 100,000 in cell phone fines in two years .
July 14 , 2009  --
When students in Abilene , Texas , return to class in six weeks they better not be caught using their cell phones .
No calls , no texting , no surfing the Web .
If they slip up and are caught , they better be prepared to pay the price : confiscation of their cell phone until they pay a $ 15 fine .
After the second offense , their parent must come in to pay the $ 15 .
The fines are meant as a get - tough approach to what educators call an out - of - control use of phones and other mobile devices in the classroom .
But in this economic downturn , the fees are bringing some much - needed revenue into the empty coffers of school districts .
Schools across the country have been cracking down on cell phone use but nowhere has that stance been stronger than in Texas where state regulations allow individual districts to confiscate the devices and charge up to $ 15 for their return .
Abilene is just one of the latest districts to toughen its stance .
Across the state at the Klein Independent School District teachers have been confiscating cell phones and slapping students with the $ 15 fee for two years .
In that time , the district has collected $ 100,948 from students .
That 's right , $ 100,948 just from errant cell phone users .
" I think that high number speaks volumes about students using their phones at inappropriate times , " said Trazanna Moreno , spokeswoman for the district just north of Houston .
" That number represents how much students are connected to that handheld , mobile technology and the fact that it 's so hard for them to break that connection . "
But do n't think that the Klein district -- with its 42,789 students -- has found the solution to its budget concerns .
The money can only be used by the school principals for enrichment activities that go beyond what the school normally offers .
That could be anything from a pizza party to reward students , to a prize auction for students who are n't tardy , to providing scholarships for students who need physical education uniforms or to buy supplies for an art class .
" Klein did n't start doing this as fundraiser .
It did it to keep children focused , " Moreno said .
" None of the funds are being used to support everyday activities that are being paid for by the taxpayers .
…
None of the funds are used to fill a deficit or anything like that . "
In fact , the district did n't budget the money or even know how much was coming in to its 39 schools from cell phone use until a reporter asked .
" I think it 's safe to say we were surprised when we added it up , " Moreno said .
She said that after two years it 's unclear if there is a measureable impact on students using the phones in the classroom .
" It 's just too early to tell , " Moreno said .
For Donna Greenan , a parent at the Klein Collins High School in Spring , Texas , the fees have become a big pain .
" I think it 's a little bit too much , " she said of the school 's policy .
Both of her children have been caught about three or four times using their phones .
Now when she comes in to pay the fines , she pays in pennies .
She and her kids will often text throughout the day .
Her daughter was ecstatic over making National Honor Society and sent a message immediately .
Besides , she said , the cell phone usage policy is unfair , especially when " the teachers are using them in the classroom . "
The Katy Independent School Distinct , west of Houston , forbid students from bringing phones to school in 2006 .
" Between the first bell and the last bell , students should not be using their cell phones and that includes lunch , " said Steve Stanford , assistant director of communications for the district .
If caught , the phone is confiscated and parents have to pay a $ 15 " administrative fee . "
Stanford said he was unable to say how much money the 58,000 - student district had collected since the rule went into effect .
The money is used to help offset the cost of summer school .
Carolyn Counce , director of policy service at Texas Association of School Boards , said that it is up to each of the state 's 1,000 different districts to set its own policy .
But they all have to live within the guidelines of a state law -- first passed in 1995 regarding pagers -- that allows a fine of up to $ 15 .
The state does not collect data on how many phones are confiscated and Counce was not sure if other states had similar policies .
Representatives at the American Association of School Administrators , the National Association of Secondary School Principals , National Association of State Boards of Education and the National School Boards Association also had not heard of such fines in other states .
Tammy Mitchell , is vice president of the Spring Hill Independent School District 's PTA in Longview , Texas .
Her husband was a school teacher and they have a teenage daughter with a cell phone .
The family has " pretty strict rules " about the cell phone use and her daughter has never been slapped with a $ 15 fine .
Still , she does n't think the fine is that effective .
" I survived school without a cell phone and I 'm kind of concerned that they are kind of out of control and a disruption , " Mitchell said .
But , " I do n't know if the $ 15 penalty is really doing anything to improve the situation . "
" They pay their $ 15 , get the cell phone back and they 're still using it , " she added .
" They are trying to be just a little more discrete about it .
They sort of mock the system , in my opinion . "
Mitchell said that good kids will do the responsible thing .
" The ones who do n't care , and are obnoxious , get caught with their cell phones and pay the $ 15 fine , generally do n't care about other things , " she said .
" What 's $ 15 to most kids ?
They 're not the ones paying it most of the time . "
There have been times when her daughter has texted during school .
But Mitchell draws a firm line .
" If my daughter texts me during the day and it's not a break or lunch time , I wo n't reply , " she said .
" I wo n't even acknowledge her because she 's not supposed to have her phone . "
She does n't know what the schools should do to stop the rampant cell phone use , but fines -- in her mind -- are not the answer .
" But hey if it helps supplement the school 's budget , I am for it , " Mitchell added .
" There are some tough times with the schools .
I 'm okay with them collecting the money , but I do n't know that 's teaching our kids anything . "

In recent years , numerous companies have been targeted , raided , and even shut down by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) for making health claims about the products they sell .
These federal agencies operate outside the realm of constitutional legitimacy and thus have pejoratively muzzled free speech concerning natural health products and their health benefits for decades .
In an effort to restore constitutional freedom of speech , Congressman Ron Paul of Texas has introduced three bills which would help dismantle the web of corruption that censors legitimate health claims and truthful information about foods , herbs , and supplements that prevent , combat , or otherwise remediate disease .
Some readers may remember back in mid-2008 when the FTC performed a witch hunt against 130 companies and one non-profit religious group who made claims about their products ' effectiveness in treating cancer .
The FTC ordered that these entities remove all claims and testimonials and issue a statement to all their customers that drugs and radiation are the only useful and proven treatments for battling cancer and that none of the products or ingredients sold by these companies were helpful in preventing or treating illness .
Similarly , in 2005 the FDA threatened to raid cherry orchards who posted legitimate , peer - reviewed scientific studies on their websites about the health benefits of cherries , claiming that the dissemination of any information correlating cherries to health would cause the cherries to become unapproved drugs subject to seizure .
There have also been countless raids , including one back in January on a company who postulated that its health products treated depression and other illnesses .
What resulted was the arrest and detention of the company 's owner by U.S. Federal Marshals for speaking the unapproved truth .
As lunatic as all of this sounds , this type of behavior has become normal operating procedure at the FDA and FTC whose unrestrained power continues to escalate into increasingly tyrannical control over free speech .
As such , Rep .
Paul 's three bills aim to end the illegitimate censorship of free speech and restore constitutional freedom of speech in natural health .
Below are their summaries and information about how to support them .
HR 3394 , , inhibits the FTC from acting against any entity for communicating the health benefits of its products unless the FTC presents " clear and convincing " evidence that those statements are false .
In concordance with the Fifth Amendment , the burden of proof concerning an accusation of a false claim is to fall upon the accuser ( FTC ) to determine , with legitimate evidence , that a claim is false before demanding its removal .
As it stands , the FTC has reversed the Fifth Amendment by preemptively and arbitrarily restraining communication without any evidence or reason while demanding that the accused party prove its claim to be true .
HR 3394 will reinforce the already lawful Fifth Amendment that establishes the burden of proof upon the FTC to present a legitimate case before impeding any lawful communication .
It will restore the freedom to communicate nutrient - disease health claims freely .
Similarly to HR 3394 , HR 3395 , , will remove the unconstitutional FDA power of " prior restraint " over all nutrient - disease relationship claims .
In other words , free speech health claims will no longer be universally banned but will be permitted .
The burden of proof will properly and lawfully fall upon the FDA to establish " clear and convincing " evidence against a claim , , if it believes a claim is false .
The First Amendment of the Constitution was designed to protect the free speech of the people from the federal government imposing " prior restraint " on speech , the very thing the FDA has instated as the foundation for its operating procedure .
This bill will preserve the proper and lawful prosecution of those who make false claims , but it will require the government and its agencies , particularly the FDA , to establish legitimate evidence against a claim that it believes to be false prior to taking any action against any person or entity rather , effectively restoring the First Amendment supremacy over the FDA .
Finally , HR 3396 , , addresses the roughly 90 % of federal government law that is enacted not by Congress , as is mandated in the Constitution under the non-delegation doctrine , but by unelected bureaucratic agencies such as the FDA and FTC .
As such , it would prohibit any law created by these agencies from being enacted without first being passed by Congress in concordance with Article I of the Constitution .
HR 3396 will restore constitutional government by returning the responsibility of legislating law to Congress which will in turn protect the public from rogue federal agencies who tend to overstep their bounds and tyrannize the people .
While these bills mostly reinforce what is already provisioned in our Constitution , they represent the potential for reform by pinpointing specific areas for which our federal government and its agencies have unlawfully violated their roles and tyrannized people by outlawing free speech , particularly health speech .
It is time to put these unelected bureaucracies in their place by supporting Rep. Ron Paul 's health freedom bills .

Vitamin D tests may prevent flu spread this winter
Category : Vitamin D Deficiency - Diagnosis and Treatment
Vitamin D may be an important factor in preventing some respiratory infections like influenza , according to new studies .
A study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine detailed the procedures whereby scientists examined vitamin D levels and occurrences of respiratory infections in about 19,000 participants .
The researchers found that those with the lowest measurements of vitamin D were more than 33 percent more likely to report having upper respiratory infections than their counterparts with higher vitamin D levels .
A second study , conducted by Dr John Cannell determined that the influenza virus can be transmuted more expansively during the winter in populations with low vitamin D levels .
The researched linked the so - called sunshine vitamin with strengthened immune systems .
Vitamin D deficiency tests allow patients to assess their current intake .
Vitamin D is also known to prevent osteoporosis , depression , prostate cancer and breast cancer .
According to Dr. Daniel Chong , a naturopathic physician in Oregon , 40 percent of the U.S. population is currently vitamin - D deficient .
The researchers pointed out that , in addition to sunlight , fresh mushrooms are a primary source of vitamin D , with a three - ounce serving providing about 100 percent of the recommended daily intake .

VOICE ONE :
This is Steve Ember .
VOICE TWO :
And this is Bob Doughty with Science in the News , a VOA Special English program about recent developments in science .
Today , we tell about the disease diabetes .
(( THEME ) )
VOICE ONE :
The World Health Organization estimates that as many as one - hundred - twenty - million people have the disease diabetes .
Diabetes is the name for several diseases with one thing in common : there is too much glucose , or sugar , in the blood .
The disease develops when the body does not produce enough insulin or produces no insulin .
Or the disease develops when the body cannot use insulin .
Insulin is a hormone that is necessary to change sugar , carbohydrates and other food into energy .
In healthy people , the body changes food into a sugar , called glucose .
Glucose is the source of fuel for the body .
When food is changed into glucose , it enters the bloodstream and is taken to all parts of the body to feed muscles , organs , and tissue .
VOICE TWO :
When the body senses that there is too much glucose in the blood , it sends a signal to the pancreas .
The pancreas is the organ that produces insulin .
The pancreas sends insulin into the bloodstream .
The insulin lowers the level of blood sugar by letting it enter cells .
Insulin helps muscles , organs and tissues take glucose and change it into energy .
That is how the body operates normally , in most people .
Diabetes is present when too much glucose remains in the bloodstream and does not enter cells .
If the amount of glucose in the blood remains too high , the body begins showing signs of diabetes .
Over time , the disease can cause blindness , kidney disease , and nerve damage .
High glucose levels in the blood also can lead to strokes and heart disease .
Blood circulation also is affected , especially in the legs .
Often , victims of diabetes must have a foot or even a leg removed because of blood circulation problems linked to the disease .
(( MUSIC BRIDGE ) )
VOICE ONE :
There are two main kinds of diabetes , Type One and Type Two .
Between five and ten percent of those suffering from diabetes have Type One .
It usually begins before the age of thirty in people who are thin .
It is most commonly found in children under the age of sixteen .
It is caused by the body¡¯s defense system .
The bodies of Type One diabetes victims produce a substance that attacks and kills some cells in the pancreas , blocking the production of insulin .
These cells are called islet ( EYE - lit ) cells .
Scientists are not sure why this happens .
They believe there may be a number of causes .
They include viruses , the presence of insect - killing pesticides in the environment or molecules known as free radicals .
Free radicals are produced as part of normal chemical processes in the body .
In people with diabetes , too many of these free radicals are present in the body .
Scientists are not sure which of these causes is the most important to the development of Type One diabetes .
VOICE TWO :
People suffering from Type
One diabetes must carefully control their diets .
And they must exercise often .
People with this kind of diabetes almost always require insulin injections .
Patients must always know their blood sugar levels .
When the level of glucose in the blood is too high , they must inject insulin into their bodies to reduce the amount of glucose .
The patients must inject insulin every day , often several times a day .
In most developed countries , insulin is easy to get and does not cost much money .
However , doctors believe that these injections can cause long - term problems .
They believe that the injections cause levels of glucose to change often .
Scientists believe that many quick changes in glucose levels can , over time , result in damage to the body .
This damage can be blindness , kidney failure , heart disease , or poor blood flow in the body .
VOICE ONE :
Type
One diabetes also is known as juvenile onset diabetes , because it usually starts in children or young people .
Scientists believe it is the form of the disease that they will most likely be able to cure some day .
Among the treatments being studied is a vaccine to prevent the disease .
A vaccine is injected into the body or taken by mouth in the form of a pill .
Another possible treatment for Type
One diabetes is placing new islet cells into the pancreas to help it make insulin .
Doctors have been transplanting islet cells into diabetes patients for several years .
However , these healthy islet cells have failed to permanently replace the need for insulin injections .
Scientists also are studying special cells called stem cells to treat the disease .
Stem cells develop into all the different kinds of cells in the body .
Scientists believe that stem cells from unborn babies could be used to treat diabetes and other diseases .
However , it would be a long time before such treatment is possible .
VOICE TWO :
While some scientists continue to seek ways to cure Type One diabetes , others are searching for easier ways to get insulin into the body .
New devices are being developed that could replace injections .
One device being tested is an inhaler .
This device would permit patients to breathe insulin into their bodies .
The insulin is in the form of a powder , like dust .
When the insulin reaches the lungs , it quickly moves into the bloodstream to reduce glucose levels .
(( MUSIC BRIDGE ) )
VOICE ONE :
Type
Two diabetes generally is found in people more than forty years old .
Most of these people are too fat .
Their bodies can not produce enough insulin to reduce the levels of glucose in their blood .
Or , their bodies do not react correctly to the action of insulin .
Type Two diabetes is more complex than Type One. Experts say Type
Two diabetes is really a group of diseases , with many possible causes .
Scientists see little hope in developing a cure for this kind of diabetes .
Instead , they are searching for better ways to control it .
Many people suffering from the disease can control it with exercise and by carefully controlling their diet .
Also , many of them do not need to inject insulin into their bodies .
Type
Two diabetes is sometimes called non-insulin dependent .
Still , patients often need drugs to treat the disease .
VOICE TWO :
There are a number of drugs that can be used .
However , many of them can cause other problems .
One of the drugs is called sulfonylurea .
It has been used for many years to help the pancreas make more insulin .
But after several years , the drug loses its effects on the pancreas .
Also , it can cause patients to gain weight .
The drug metformin appears to be more effective .
It lowers the amounts of glucose in the blood .
It does this by helping the body make better use of its own natural insulin .
It does not cause weight gain .
However , metformin can be dangerous for people with damaged kidneys .
It should not be used by people who drink large amounts of alcohol , or those with kidney , liver or heart problems .
VOICE ONE :
Genes seem to be more important in the development of Type Two diabetes than in Type One .
About ninety percent of those with Type Two diabetes have parents and ancestors who also had the disease .
In recent years , scientists have found several genes that may be linked to Type Two diabetes .
Some of these genes also are linked to extreme overweight , known as obesity .
About eighty to ninety percent of people with Type Two diabetes are obese .
Often doctors do not discover that patients have diabetes until one of the disease¡¯s serious results is found .
For example , a doctor examines a patient suffering several health problems .
The doctor carries out tests and finds the problems are the results of poor kidney performance .
Tests then show the patient is suffering from diabetes , which can cause kidney problems and even failure .
VOICE TWO :
Although great progress has been made in the treatment of diabetes , it is still widespread and threatens the health of millions of people .
Scientists hope that their research will lead to a cure for Type One diabetes .
And they hope they can find new ways to improve treatment of Type Two diabetes .
In future programs we will discuss new developments in diabetes research as they are reported .

Distraught over his divorce and the loss of his job , James Mulvaney did the unthinkable , Ventura County authorities say .
Sometime after his ex-wife dropped their two children off at his Thousand Oaks apartment Tuesday , Mulvaney stabbed 12 - year - old Jason and 7 - year - old Jennifer to death in their bedrooms .
The 52 - year - old father then took his own life by overdosing on prescription pills , a preliminary review Thursday by the county medical examiner ’s office indicates .
Pending toxicology tests are needed to confirm the finding , but Mulvaney ’s body had no visible trauma and prescription medicines were found in the residence , Deputy Medical Examiner Michael Tellez said .

Autopsies revealed that the children died of multiple stab wounds , Sheriff ’s Det. Eric Buschow said .
The killings were so frenzied that the scene in the children ’s bedrooms shook even seasoned homicide investigators .
“ Whatever took place in there was horrific , ” Buschow said .
Investigators are calling it a murder - suicide .
They did n’t find a suicide note and said Mulvaney had no criminal record .
But court records show that Mulvaney and his ex-wife , Julie Mulvaney , had been battling in court over child custody , the sale of a home and financial issues for more than a year .
Advertisement
Then , in early September , Mulvaney was let go from a senior position at Citibank in Camarillo , a job he ’d held for more than a decade , a bank source said .
A Citibank spokesman confirmed that Mulvaney was a former employee but declined to provide any other information about him .
Julie Mulvaney , also a banker , filed for divorce in February 2008 .
Though their marriage had legally ended last November , the couple was headed for a January trial to resolve outstanding issues , the court records show .
Neighbors say that Mulvaney moved to his apartment at the Knolls , located in one of Thousand Oaks ’ wealthiest neighborhoods , about six months ago .
He was frequently seen taking his children to the park or the swimming pool .
“ In this economy , a lot of marriages are failing , ” said Kathleen Zlokowich , who lives in another section of the large complex .
“ And it seems like the husbands all end up here . ”

After his wife dropped off the kids Tuesday , Mulvaney took his son to soccer practice as usual that night , Buschow said .
His ex-wife began to worry when she discovered that the children had not shown up for school on Wednesday , he said .
She drove to the apartment about 5:45 p.m. and found the bodies after entering the unlocked front door , Buschow said .
“ We ca n’t know what was going on in his head , ” the detective said .
“ But I ca n’t imagine what would lead someone to do this to his own children . ”

Rachel Maddow reports on the funding source behind Liz Cheney 's " Keep America Safe " .
Surprise , surprise ... a man who 's helping to attempt to " polish " Dick Cheney 's political legacy .
I do n't know how anyone could possibly " polish " that big of a turd , but it looks like it 's not going to stop them from trying .
Maddow :
Big news to report tonight about a new effort by the Cheney family and funded by some of the biggest money men in the Republican Party to attack President Obama on national security to try to undermine his presidency .
It ’s an effort that ’s being led on the surface by Dick Cheney and his daughter Liz .
And tonight we ’re learning new details about whose bankrolling their mission behind the scenes .
In conjunction with former Vice - President Cheney ’s speech this week attacking President Obama for not having yet announced a decision on the way forward in Afghanistan , a new pressure group headed up by Mr. Cheney ’s daughter Liz has released this new attack ad . [… ]
According to Newsweek ’s Michael Isikoff Keep America
Safe is gearing up to run TV ads and radio ads and web ads like that in the home districts of Democratic members of Congress in the lead up to the 2010 elections .
They ’re promising in particular to attempt to exploit the issue of closing Guantanamo for political gain .
The lead story on the Keep America Safe web site right now says “ Transferring Gitmo Prisoners To U.S. Will Set Them Free ” .
Well today Mr. Isikoff revealed on Newsweek ’s new Classified blog exactly who is bankrolling the Cheney family ’s Keep America Safe political machine .
America — meet Mel Sembler .
He may not be a household name to most of us , but he ’s a Florida real estate mogul who is very , very well known in Republican circles .
Mr. Sembler is the former finance chairman of the Republican National Committee .
He served as President Bush ’s ambassador to Italy and he’s now throwing all of his considerable financial muscle behind the Cheney ’s new anti-Obama venture .
Mr. Sembler told Newsweek “ I love Liz Cheney and what she ’s doing … [ I ’ll be ] as supportive as my budget will allow ” .
Mr. Sembler is a very close friend of the Cheney family .
Here he is posing with the Second Lady of the United States Lynn Cheney .
He ’s so close to the Cheney ’s in fact that in addition to bankrolling the Cheney ’s family ’s new anti-Obama political group , Mr. Sembler is also the chairman of the Scooter Libby Legal Defense Trust , set up to defend Mr. Cheney ’s Chief of Staff Scooter Libby when Mr. Libby was charged with lying and obstructing the investigation into the Bush / Cheney White House for outing a covert CIA officer as political revenge .
The “ Scooter Did n’t Do It ” chairman is the new bankroller of the opposition to President Obama and incidentally the polishing of Dick Cheney ’s political legacy , which seems like it might be an expensive undertaking .
Welcome everyone to the Down - Low on what to Download .
This past Thursday ( well , Friday ) the US store recieved four new demos .
Two of them , Wet and Dirt 2 , were on the UK store last week .
And two new ones , NHL 10 and Fear 2 : Reborn , are on the UK store as well this week .
Fear 2 : Reborn
This demo is a look at the upcoming DLC for Fear 2 .
The premise of the demo is that you play as Replica Soldier Foxtrot 183 , and there is a voice in your head compelling you to disobey orders from Replica Command .
You go AWOL , and must escape Replica Outpost .
The demo starts with you being surrounded by dead bodies , and hearing the voices of soldiers looking for you .
You have to fight your way through multiple levels of the Replica Outpost .
You will encounter normal soldiers , as well as heavy soldiers who look like armored mechs .
The demo only takes about 10 minutes to complete , the length was n’t the actual issue .
All of our staff members felt that this demo was majorly lacking .
It does n’t do anything new and , for the most part , it came off as mediocre .
The full retail game was released back in February , and if you did not purchase it then there is little here to change your mind .
You probably wo n’t miss much if you skip out on this one .
NHL 10
This demo covers EA ’s latest installment in its NHL franchise , and it ’s unusually big for a sports demo .
There is a tutorial that shows you the basic shooting and checking mechanics .
You also get to try out two game modes , the first of which is Battle for the Cup .
This mode will have you playing as either the Pittsburgh Penguins or the Detroit Red Wings in Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals .
You only play one quarter , but it ’s enough to get a good feel for the game .
The other mode is Be a Pro , which allows you to create a superstar and play in the prospect game .
Be a Pro mode only allows you to participate in the third quarter , and you can only control your created player .
And though the camera only follows you , not the puck , it ’s still a cool concept and offers plenty of fun .
This was a pretty robust demo and was very enjoyable , with most of the staff offering significant praise for the demo .
The graphics look excellent , and the two modes included , though short , really give a good taste of what to expect from the full game .
If you ’re an NHL fan , this is definitely the demo for you .
NHL 10 looks to be a solid rental at the very least , and maybe even worthy of a full purchase .
Wet / Dirt 2
These two demos were on the EU store last week , and , in general , the staff enjoyed them .
Wet has some interesting gameplay mechanics , and has creeped up most of our lists from “ who cares ” to “ must rent ” .
Dirt 2 is extremely fun and looks absolutely amazing , and most of the staff agrees that this game is will probably be a must buy .
For our full impressions on these two games , check out last week ’s post here .
That wraps up the Down - Low on What to Download for the week of 8/31 .
To recap , Fear 2 comes off as a pretty uninspired FPS , and for the most part there is little reason to download it .
NHL 10 is a very impressive NHL game .
The demo has a lot to offer , and was really enjoyable .
If you ’re an NHL fan , than this game is definitely one to check out .
The last two demos we looked at last week , were pretty interesting , though Dirt 2 takes the spotlight as a great offroad racer with slick graphics and tight controls .
Mr Zoellick says a more balanced global economy would be more stable US economic power is declining as a result of the financial crisis , the head of the World Bank has said .
" One of the legacies of this crisis may be a recognition of changed economic power relations , " said World Bank president Robert Zoellick .
The US , the world 's biggest economy , has been in recession for almost two years , while emerging economies like China and Brazil have grown .
This may help bring about a long - term rebalancing of the world economy .
' Changed relations ' " A multi-polar economy less reliant on the US consumer will be a more stable world economy , " Mr Zoellick said .
He was speaking in Istanbul before meetings of the the World Bank and International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , where there is some discussion about how to reorganise the leadership of the bodies so that they better reflect the diversified world .
For example , China recently got a permanent chair on the IMF 's 24 - seat policy - making committee .
G7 or G20 ?
Finance ministers from the Group of Seven ( G7 ) richest nations - the US , Japan , Germany , UK , France , Canada and Italy - have also been meeting in Istanbul .
The G7 said the world economy was improving but " there is no room for complacency since the prospects for growth remain fragile and labour market conditions are not yet improving . "
Unemployment in the US on Friday surged to a new 26 - year high of 9.8 % .
G7 finance ministers agreed to keep stimulus spending in place " until recovery is assured " .
US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said the US economy had " improved dramatically " but that " conditions for a sustained recovery , led by private demand , are not yet fully established " .
Mr Geithner also said the world is recovering " sooner and stronger " than expected .
Questions have also been raised about the future of the G7 .
The Group of 20 - consisting of the largest economies including China , India , Russia and Brazil - appears to have replaced it over the past year .
The G20 leaders said after their meeting in Pittsburgh last month that it will become the world 's " premier " decision - making forum .

With respect to a recent media report , the IAEA reiterates that it has no concrete proof that there is or has been a nuclear weapon programme in Iran .
At the Board of Governors ´ meeting on 9 September 2009 , Director General Mohamed ElBaradei warned that continuing allegations that the IAEA was withholding information on Iran are politically motivated and totally baseless .
The Agency receives information from a variety of sources that may have relevance to the implementation of safeguards .
All such information is critically assessed by a team of experts working collectively in accordance with the Agency´s practices .
The IAEA reiterates that all relevant information and assessments that have gone through the above process have already been provided to the IAEA Board of Governors in reports of the Director General .
Documentary filmmaker Adam Curtis is trying something new on the web .
It 's unearthing a secret , patchwork history that reads like a novel .
It 's about Afghanistan , and what he calls " our dreams of Afghanistan , and their dreams of us " .
As part of a mission to unearth lost gems from the BBC archive , it 's full of extraordinary stories - how hippies created the heroin business , for example , or how American engineers tried to build a model democracy in the 1950s .
It 's old fashioned journalism , the kind that TV news seems reluctant to do .
Adam kindly offered to explain it to us .
If you 've missed it , here are Kabul , City Number One Kinshasha , City Number Two , and The Secret History of Helmand .
Much of what we discussed follows on from the latter - which explores the grand , techno - utopian designs of US nation building in the 1950s .
Q . When people read it , people who know your work , they 'll recognise a few familiar Adam Curtis themes .
What was it that caught your eye ?
I was completely shocked by the way it was being reported .
Our relationship to Afghanistan the way it 's reported now is not even two - dimensional , it 's one - dimensional .
Documentaries , and a lot of television now , is possessed by the mantra that people will only watch your film , or listen to your program , if it " touches something in them " .
So the reporting has to find something in Afghanistan that 's some terrible thing that has happened " to somebody like you , or just like your child " .
It 's done with the best intentions , and a certain kind of desperation to keep an audience .
But it makes it more and more incomprehensible .
Because it becomes a land full of victims and out there in the darkness , dark forces we do n't understand .
I 'm trying to build up a body of evidence of just how complicated our relationship to that country has been .
One thing that fits in to your canon is psychologists , and another is nation building , with both sets of people trying to form society to a model .
I did not know America had tried a kind of nation building before .
The whole idea that you could use scientific ideas to substitute for what was essentially a political project .
That instead of political fallabilities you have a series of certainties - scientific principles - on which you could build nations .
They really did believe that .
But they tried it on Afghanistan and it's one of the biggest they ever did .
It shocked me .
Like everyone else I have watched the picture of Helmand , and had the impression that this is a dusty old landscape where we 've disturbed something really complicated .
To quote : " It has been there a long time , we 're better out of it . "
It 's not , it 's a bit more like Ancient Greece , we 're fighting amongst the ruins of one of the giant American technocratic projects .
In five years nobody 's done a proper history .
Documentary strands have become very worthy - it's as if they 're not addressing us as an audience , but policy makers .
And they start with the basis that it's an intractable problem .

Advertisement US President Barack Obama has been awarded the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize .
The Nobel Committee said he won it for " his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and co-operation between peoples " .
The committee highlighted Mr Obama 's efforts to support international bodies and promote nuclear disarmament .
Mr Obama - woken up with the news early on Friday - said in an address at the White House that he was " surprised and deeply humbled " by the award .
He said he did not feel he deserved to be in the company of some of the " transformative figures " who had previously received the award .
Speaking outside the White House , he said he would accept the prize as a " call to action " .
There were a record 205 nominations for this year 's peace prize .
Zimbabwean Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai and Chinese dissident Hu Jia had been among the favourites .
Instead the committee chose Mr Obama , who was inaugurated less than two weeks before the 1 February nomination deadline .
There was widespread surprise at the committee 's decision .
While world leaders were largely supportive of the award , thousands of people have contacted the BBC with more sceptical views .
An estimated 75 % of comment sent to the BBC expressed surprise at the award .
Some said awarding the prize to Mr Obama was plain wrong , others that the decision had come too soon , before he had made any concrete foreign policy achievement .
ANALYSIS Paul Reynolds
BBC News , London
The award is certainly unexpected and might be regarded as more of an encouragement for intentions than a reward for achievements .
After all , the president has been in office for a little over eight months and he might hope to serve eight years .
His ambition for a world free of nuclear weapons is one that is easier to declare than to achieve and a climate control agreement has yet to be reached .
Indeed , the citation indicates that it is President Obama 's world view that attracted the Nobel committee - that diplomacy should be founded " on the basis of values and attitudes that are shared by the majority of the world 's population " .
Obama rewarded for world view The Nobel laureate - chosen by a five - member committee - wins a gold medal , a diploma and 10 m Swedish kronor ( $ 1.4 m ) .
" Only very rarely has a person to the same extent as Obama captured the world 's attention and given its people hope for a better future , " the Norwegian committee said in a statement .
" His diplomacy is founded in the concept that those who are to lead the world must do so on the basis of values and attitudes that are shared by the majority of the world 's population . "
Asked why the prize had been awarded to Mr Obama less than a year after he took office , Nobel Committee head Thorbjoern Jagland said : " It was because we would like to support what he is trying to achieve " .
" It is a clear signal that we want to advocate the same as he has done , " he said .
He specifically mentioned Mr Obama 's work to strengthen international institutions and work towards a world free of nuclear arms .
' New climate ' Reaction to the committee 's decision from around the world was swift and varied .
MARDELL'S AMERICA
There was already a huge weight of responsibility on Obama 's shoulders , and this medal hung round his neck has just made it a little heavier
Mark Mardell
BBC North America editor
Read Mark 's thoughts in full Mohamed ElBaradei , the head of the UN 's nuclear watchdog , the IAEA , said he could not think of anyone more deserving of the award .
" In less than a year in office , he has transformed the way we look at ourselves and the world we live in and rekindled hope for a world at peace with itself , " Mr ElBaradei said .
At the other end of the spectrum , Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told the Reuters news agency the award was ridiculous .
" The Nobel prize for peace ?
Obama should have won the ' Nobel Prize for escalating violence and killing civilians ' , " he said .
Since taking office in January , President Obama has pursued an ambitious international agenda including a push for peace in the Middle East and negotiations over Iran 's nuclear programme .
THE SELECTION PROCESS
Those qualified to nominate candidates include members of national governments , international judiciary , academics and previous prize winners Five Norwegians are chosen by Norway 's parliament to sit on the Nobel Committee
The committee compiles a shortlist of between five and 20 candidates
The shortlist is considered by the Nobel Institute 's permanent advisers , mainly Norwegian academics
The Nobel Committee chooses the winner Details of the nominations and selection process are kept secret for 50 years
World reacts to Obama peace prize Profile : Barack Obama
But critics say he has failed to make breakthroughs .
Domestically , Mr Obama has been working to tackle an economic crisis and win support for healthcare reform .
Some said they saw the prize as a way of encouraging the US leader early in his presidency .
" It is an award that speaks to the promise of President Obama 's message of hope , " said Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa , a former winner .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy said the award confirmed " America 's return to the hearts of the people of the world " .
The statement from the Nobel Committee said Mr Obama had " created a new climate in international politics " .
" Multilateral diplomacy has regained a central position , with emphasis on the role that the United Nations and other international institutions can play , " it said .
The committee added that the US was now playing a more constructive role in meeting " the great climatic challenges " facing the world , and that democracy and human rights would be strengthened .
Mr Obama is the first US president to win the prize since former US President Jimmy Carter in 2002 .
Former vice - president Al Gore shared the prize in 2007 .
HAVE YOUR SAY
It 's a great nomination .
It can only encourage Obama to strive to achieve the recognition it brings , as a global peacemaker .
Simon Cordiner , Glasgow , UK Among earlier US leaders , Theodore Roosevelt won the prize in 1906 and Woodrow Wilson won it in 1919 .
The Nobel prize was invented by the Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite Alfred Nobel , and was first awarded in 1901 .
He designated the parliament in Norway , which at the time was united with Sweden , to elect the peace prize committee .
Swedish academies are responsible for other prizes .
The prize - giving ceremony for the peace award is due to take place on 10 December in the Norwegian capital , Oslo .

we who are about to facepalm … hard .
Chris Mooney is still running in circles , even after extensive feedback about his latest string of deeply flawed commentary .
Poor , poor Chris Mooney .
I ’m seriously beginning to think he ’s unwell .
After desperately grasping on to Josh Rosenau ’s attempt to present Richard Dawkins as an accommodationist and trying to cheer victory for his rather confusing and poorly thought out cause , he took his message to the Huffington Post with the thesis that the evil leader of New Atheism has turned a new leaf and gave up on advocating his godlessness .
Much of the article is a rambling recounting of his self - congratulatory blog post , complete with a cherry - picking of the two quotes in question , and the reaction it provoked from atheists and Dawkins himself .
Only in the end of his rambling does he actually get to the point he so desperately wants to make .
But what ’s truly noteworthy is where Dawkins hints as to how this all happened - e.g. , he ’s got an evolution book to sell now , and he ’s sick of people thinking it ’s an atheism book , so he ’s trying to steer interviewers away from that , and seems frankly annoyed that they do n’t get the difference …
After writing a million - selling atheist “ consciousness - raiser ” and “ come - out - of - the - closet ” book , is it at all surprising that Dawkins now finds his evolution book being prominently linked to atheism in the media mind ?
All right Chris , I ’m going to explain this slowly and carefully .
Reporters and science writers will often get stuck on doing the same thing over and over again , promoting their favorite angle on a story no matter the real topic at hand .
Just like you ’re doing by using every mention of PZ or Coyne or Dawkins as an argument for your big pet project of promoting accommodationism so ardent theists will really like you .
But Dawkins already laid out his case for atheism and is moving on to talk about evolution as a scientist , so anyone expecting another fiery affirmation of his godlessness is going to be disappointed .
If reporters with one - track minds like yours go on to make The Greatest Show on Earth seem like a sequel to The God Delusion , he ’s going to have lots of very dissatisfied fans out there .
Hence the damage control .
Now , you would think that having promoted a book and being vaguely aware of the marketing requirements in doing so ( though his ability to handle criticism needs whole a lot of work ) , Mooney would be able to consider this train of thought .
But that ’s not what he does .
Instead , he starts beating his battle drum with wild abandon .
In this context , perhaps what ’s really going on is that Dawkins would like to promote his new book without too much religion - bashing attached to it .
And given what he ’s now trying to achieve — to communicate about the science of evolution , which is a very important objective — that ’s a very wise thing to do .
If Dawkins wants to change minds about evolution , and break down barriers , it makes a heck of a lot of sense to move to the center on religion , and not alienate religious believers or the U.S. media any more than he has to .
Religion bashing ?
Hello ?
Is this the author of a book that tore into Republicans for following an anti-scientific religious dogma in corrupting scientific literacy in America talking ?
Has Mooney lost the ability to put together logical arguments ?
Does he really think being nice about how to promote the science behind the evolutionary theory will sway people who think that accepting evolution means they ’ll be tortured by Satan ’s minions in the pits of Hell for blasphemy ?
Is he still as detached from reality as he was when writing that ridiculous op - ed in the LA Times which sought to pit atheists against the NCSE as part of his Quixotic crusade ?
It ’s sad to see a once promising science writer shooting himself in the foot again and again .
It really is .
Americans need to change the way they live if they want to beat the obesity epidemic that is robbing the United States of millions of dollars every year and threatening a generation with shorter lives , experts said Monday .
Two - thirds of US adults and around one fifth of American children are now overweight or obese , and the rising rate of obesity in the United States has had a debilitating effect on healthcare spending , not to mention on health .
Childhood obesity " is the number one public health problem in the country , putting the younger generation at risk of being the first in the history of our country to have a shorter lifespan than their parents , " former president Bill Clinton told the " Weight of the Nation " conference .
The conference was the first gathering on obesity organized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) .
Clinton was representing the Alliance for a Healthier Generation , which aims to significantly cut childhood obesity by 2015 .
CDC officials outlined two dozen steps -- ranging from banning televisions from children 's bedrooms to making it easier for people to buy fresh food -- to help beat obesity and bring down related medical costs , which have nearly doubled since 1998 .
Eleven years ago , the medical costs associated with obesity were at around 78 billion dollars a year ; in 2006 , they had climbed to around 147 billion dollars annually , a study released to coincide with Monday 's conference showed .
The steep rise in medical costs was blamed on obesity , which " raises your risk for many health conditions , " said Dr Eric Finkelstein , lead author of the study .
A normal - weight person 's annual healthcare expenditures are around 41 percent lower than those of obese individuals , said Finkelstein .
" The normal weight individual will spend around 3,400 dollars per year in medical expenditures and that rises to around 4,870 dollars if that individual is obese , " said Finkelstein .
The bulk of obesity - related medical spending is not linked to clinical procedures such as bariatric surgery to ward off overeating , but rather to treating diseases caused by obesity , such as diabetes .
" The lion 's share of diabetes in the US is caused by excess weight " and the annual cost for treating just diabetes is about 180 million dollars , said Dr Thomas Frieden , head of the CDC .
" Obesity is costly ... the only way to show real savings in health expenditures in the future is through efforts to reduce obesity and related health conditions , " Finkelstein said .
The way to do that , said Clinton , Frieden and William Dietz , director of the CDC 's division of nutrition and physical activity , is to get Americans to change the way they live .
" Obesity is a public health issue that cannot be dealt with entirely in the confines of a medical office , " Clinton told the conference .
" We have to change what goes on in our homes , in our communities , in our schools , " he said .
With the average American 23 pounds ( 11 kilos ) overweight and nearly half of the extra 350 calories that are ingested today compared with several decades ago coming from sodas , Frieden -- who spearheaded a successful campaign against tobacco in New York which was largely driven by mightily taxing cigarettes -- suggested a similar tax on sugary soft drinks to curb obesity .
Dietz told a group of schoolchildren from Pennsylvania that 65 percent of US children have a television in their bedroom .
TV sets should be banned from the bedroom and youngsters encouraged to be physically active instead , he said .
Only one of the kids had a TV in their bedroom , none of them liked the idea of taxing soft drinks , but , then again , none was overweight or obese .

" In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth . " Bibliographical introduction .
Mainly , no doubt , because of the predominance of French as the language of educated people in England from the time of the Norman Conquest until the middle of the fourteenth century , the Bible , as a whole , remained untranslated into English until the last years of the life of Wyclif .
Quotations
In the beginning was the Word , and the Word was with God , and the Word was God .
For by grace are ye saved through faith ; and that not of yourselves : it is the gift of God : Not of works , lest any man should boast .
Ephesians 2:8-9 For
God so loved ye world , that he gave his only begotten Sonne : that whosoever beleeveth in him , should not perish , but have everlasting life .
Last words
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all .
Amen .

Rob Cockerham interviewed John Marcotte , a Sacramento man who filed a petition with the California Secretary of State to get a voter 's initiative onto the 2010 ballot in California that would make it ban divorce .
RC : Are you going to hit the streets collecting signatures for the initiative ?
John :
We 're going to set up a table in front of Wal * Mart and ask people to sign a petition to protect traditional marriage .
We 're going to interview them about why they thing traditional marriage is important , and then we 'll tell them that we are trying to ban divorce .
People who supported Prop 8 were n't trying to take rights away from gays , they just wanted to protect traditional marriage .
That 's why I 'm confident that they will support this initiative , even though this time it will be their rights that are diminished .
To not support it would be hypocritical .
We 're also going to collect signatures in front of " Faces , " the largest gay nightclub in Sacramento .
Forget everything you 've read about vampires so far .
The current bloodsucking trend , achieving maximum ferocity in November with the release of the sequel to Twilight , is n't about outsiders or immigrants or religion or even AIDS , as critics and bloggers have argued ad nauseam these past few months .
There 's a much better , simpler , more obvious explanation : Vampires have overwhelmed pop culture because young straight women want to have sex with gay men .
Not all young straight women , of course , but many , if not most , of them .
Neil Gaiman , sci - fi novelist and geek grandmaster , found out just how many during the shitstorm of pique that covered him from head to toe this past summer after he suggested in an interview that the vampire craze had run its course and should disappear for another twenty to twenty - five years .
( Twilight fans took to Twitter in protest . )
A foolish hope .
The craving for vampire fiction is not a matter of taste but of urges ; one does not read or watch it so much as inject it through the eyes , and like any epidemic , it 's symptomatic of something much larger : a quiet but profound sexual revolution and a new acceptance of freakiness in mainstream American life .
Vampires have always stalked the cultural landscape at moments of carnal crisis .
The seminal short story " The Vampyre , " written in 1819 by John Polidori , was based on his fascination with Lord Byron , the icon of Romantic sexual liberation and danger .
The frisson of deviance was there right from the start : Nobody really knows what happened between Byron and Polidori , but both of their memoirs were destroyed for the sake of propriety .
( Byron , a few whispered , had even slept with his sister . )
Bram Stoker 's masterpiece , Dracula , appeared right in the middle of what historians call the Great Binge , a period in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries when cocaine and heroin use ran rampant , and the poster for the novel 's first - ever movie adaptation promised " the strangest passion the world has ever known ! "
More recently , a small boom in vampire movies ( The Hunger , The Lost Boys ) coincided exactly with the rise of AIDS , their vampires intelligent and glamorous and doomed .
All these earlier iterations of the theme are not at all like vampire fiction today .
Our vampires are normal .
They 're not Goth , they 're not scary , they 're not even that weird .
This fall 's big vampire show is on the CW , the Gossip Girl network , and its producer also brought the world Dawson 's Creek .

In the best - selling Undead series of MaryJanice Davidson , the Queen of the Vampires is a suburbanite named Betsy Taylor .
Edward , the romantic hero of the Twilight series , is a sweet , screwed - up high school kid , and at the beginning of his relationship with Bella , she is attracted to him because he is strange , beautiful , and seemingly repulsed by her .
This exact scenario happened several times in my high school between straight girls and gay guys who either had n't figured out they were gay or were still in the closet .
Twilight 's fantasy is that the gorgeous gay guy can be your boyfriend , and for the slightly awkward teenage girls who consume the books and movies , that 's the clincher .
Vampire fiction for young women is the equivalent of lesbian porn for men : Both create an atmosphere of sexual abandon that is nonthreatening .
That 's what everybody wants , is n't it ?
Sex that 's dangerous and safe at the same time , risky but comfortable , gooey and violent but also traditional and loving .
In the bedroom , we want to have one foot in the twenty - first century and another in the nineteenth .
True Blood also casts its shadow on the romance between a young woman and a vampire , but unlike Twilight , which is all subtext and love - that - dare - not - speak - its - name , HBO 's cult series connects vampirism to homosexuality explicitly .
In the opening credits best opening credits ever ?
a passing road sign reads GOD HATES FANGS .
The vampires call the humans " breathers " instead of " breeders , " and the series opens with a talk - show interview about vampires " mainstreaming , " or " coming out of the coffin . "
True Blood contrasts its vampires ' desires for normalcy with humans who are extreme drug users , shape - shifters , and orgiastic maenads , and it's a perfect encapsulation of the American bedroom at this moment :
Everyone is a freak , even the people who claim to rail against freakiness .
The first question that comes to mind when you see a family - values orator today is , " I wonder if he 's into meth - fueled orgies with male hookers ? "
And the segment of the religious Right that is not hypocritical has more or less joined the party :
An evangelical preacher whose mission in life is to make Christians freakier is telling his flock to try anal play .
For most Americans , there is no longer any such thing as a shameful sexual act between consenting adults .
Having a bland sex life ?
Now , that 's shameful .
No one would dare admit to that .
And so vampires have appeared to help America process its newfound acceptance of what so many once thought strange or abnormal .
Adam and Steve who live on your corner with their adorable little son and run a bakery ?
The transgendered man who gave birth to a healthy baby ?
The teenage girl who wishes that all boys could be vampires ?
All part of the luscious and terrifying magic of today 's sexual revolution .
The political consequences are sweeping Iowa 's Supreme Court ruling on gay marriage is further proof of an old wise man 's dictum that the United States invariably does the right thing , after first exhausting all the other alternatives and the cultural impact is just beginning to be felt .
Stephenie Meyer 's fourth book in her vampire series , Breaking Dawn , will one rumor has it be broken into as many as three different films , which means that husbands , fathers , and boyfriends could find themselves dragged to Twilight movies over the next decade .
Neil Gaiman should take some comfort , though : Vampires will eventually go away .
They always do .
But only when they 've sucked our fear and our longing dry .

The Soviet - Afghan War was a ten - year conflict which involved Soviet Union forces which supported the Marxist People ’s Democratic Party of Afghanistan .
The Soviets and the PDPA worked together against the Islamist mujahideen resistance .
The PDPA government was also supported by India , while the mujahideen resistance found support among a variety of sources , including the United States , Saudi Arabia , Pakistan , and many other nations involved in the Cold War .
The first Soviet deployment into Afghanistan began on December 24 , 1979 .
During this time , the Afghan government requested the introduction of Soviet troops in order to provide security and to assist in the fight against the mujahideen rebels .
Within a few months , the government had requested the assistance of several Soviet helicopters and tanks , as well as crews to guard the government facilities in Kabul .
The Soviets responded to this request by sending an airborne battalion , which was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel A. Lomakin .
In order to keep news of the deployment low , the Colonel and his men arrived without their combat gear and disguised as technicians .
They were assigned to be the personal bodyguards for President Taraki .
Over the course of a few months , the Afghan requests increased and they were no longer for individual crews , but for entire regiments and battalions .
Despite this support from the Soviet union , many Afghan rebel groups garnered support from the United States .
A mere six months after Soviet deployment , US intelligence services began to aid these rebel factions .
The struggle continued with limited forces until the mid-1980s , when the Afghan resistance , aided by the United States , Pakistan , Saudi Arabia , and the United Kingdom continued to contribute to Moscow ’s high military costs and strained relationships with other countries .
The US viewed the entire conflict as being necessary in the Cold War struggle , and President Jimmy Carter authorized the CIA to begin covert ops to get many types of assistance to the Afghan rebels in order to hinder the Soviet forces and their advancement through Afghanistan .
This entire operation was dubbed Operation Cyclone .
A very similar movement happened in other Muslim countries , which brought contingents of Afghan Arabs and foreign fighters who wanted to wage jihad against the communists .
Perhaps the most notable of these fighters was a young Saudi named Osama bin Laden , whose militant Arab group would eventually form al - Qaeda .
Over the years of the continued guerrilla warfare , leadership changed often and always came with the title of commander .
This title was applied to independent Afghani leaders and there were many of them who lead the fighting units of all sizes .
Afghan people looked up to these fighters and though military pride had never been something which occurred in Afghanistan , people began looking to the rebels for help against the oppressive communist government being task forced by the Russians .
Eventually , due to the high cost of the Afghani support and increased pressure from the United States and other super powers , the Soviets began to withdraw from the conflict in the summer of ’ 88 .
By the spring of ’ 89 , there were no more Soviet forces within Afghanistan .
Today , Afghanistan is a wounded country in every way .
However , there are Afghan people who have made it big elsewhere and continue to aid the country .
An example is the Bayat Foundation , which was founded by Ehsan Bayat , a successful engineer and businessman who is living in New York , but recently returned to his home country in order to help revitalize it .

For a long time , the climate change debate in Washington took place along predictable lines : industry on one side , environmentalists on the other .
But now , with the prospect of actual legislation passing Congress , and the attendant opportunities for political and financial gain , the competition has erupted into a giant free - for - all .
Since 2003 , the climate lobby has grown by more than 400 percent , to a total of 2,810 lobbyists — 5 to every lawmaker .
The largest players are still formidable : The American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity , a collection of power companies and mining , rail , and manufacturing interests , spent $ 9.95 million lobbying Congress and the White House last year , more than any other group devoted solely to climate change .
But there are now also 138 lobbyists representing alternative energy technologies .
Environmental and health lobbyists numbered fewer than 50 six years ago ; there are now 176 .
( Still , the alternative energy and environmental lobbyists put together are outnumbered more than 7 - to - 1 by those for major industries . )
Perhaps the most telling shift in the debate is the complex position of big business , once a reliable foe of carbon restrictions .
This year , the US Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers opposed the Waxman - Markey cap - and - trade bill , but tech companies like Google ( which is interested in smart - grid technology ) and Sun Microsystems ( which is developing more energy - efficient servers ) support it .
Business for Innovative Climate and Energy Policy , a coalition that includes eBay , Symantec , Nike , and Starbucks , is actually lobbying for greater emissions cuts .
By contrast , the US Climate Action Partnership , a coalition of corporations such as General Motors , Duke Energy , ConocoPhillips , and Dow Chemical as well as environmental groups such as the Natural Resources Defense Council , lobbied for and won a massive giveaway of emissions credits that President Obama had wanted polluters to pay for .
Another new player is the finance industry , which had virtually no lobbyists on global warming in 2003 .
This year , banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase , as well as insurance companies and private equity firms , have 159 representatives working on the issue .
The companies are eager to jump into the carbon market that a cap - and - trade system would create , which by one regulator ’s estimate could be worth $ 2 trillion .
Wall Street wants this market to be loosely regulated and open to speculators , and it wants it to include over - the - counter derivatives — the unregulated instruments that caused insurance giant AIG to implode .
And the list goes on .
Because energy is so central to the economy , everyone has a stake in the climate fight — from the massive transportation and agriculture ( see “ Betting the Farm “ ) lobbies down to churches and local governments .
No wonder the bill ballooned from 648 pages to more than 1,400 by the time it completed its journey through the House .
The number of lobbyists working the Hill on climate change has increased more than
400 %
2003 : 525 | 2009 : 2,810

Oregon Ground Water Association ,
Legal challenges filed in the State Court of Appeals and Marion County Circuit Court were responsible for returning fees improperly collected by the Water Resources Department .
The Oregon Ground Water Association had raised the issue that the agency was collecting fees from recent legislative changes even before they were signed into law by the Governor .
As a result of the legal challenges the Department is returning some of the fees collected between the 1st and 23nd of July , 2009 .
Fees that may be subject to a refund include new fees and overpayments of subsequently increased fees paid to the Department for well construction ( HB - 2231 ) , for submission of geotechnical logs ( HB - 2232 ) , and for ‘ exempt ’ uses and applications for water rights , transfers , and certificates ( SB - 788 ) .
Exempt uses of water include domestic use up to 15,000 gpd , stockwatering , down - hole heat exchanges , lawn and gardens not exceeding ½ acre and commercial applications up to 5,000 gpd .
The Water Resources Commission adopted temporary rules for a new $ 300 fee and mapping requirement for those water uses that are exempt from a ground water permit .
In September the Commission modified those temporary rules and changed the effective date of the rules from July 1st to July 23rd , with the fee applicable to wells completed on or after July 23 , 2009 .
The Oregon Ground Water Association recommends that the public check for incorrect or overpayment of any fee paid to the Department after
July 1 , 2009 .
GENEVA ( Reuters ) - A leading expert on chemical and biological arms control called Wednesday for urgent efforts to stop new mind - altering drugs developed for medical purposes from being adopted by the military for use in warfare .

In an article in the U.S. journal Nature , British academic Malcolm Dando said civilian researchers in many countries seemed largely unaware of the danger and urged quick action to adapt a key arms pact to head it off .
“ In the past 20 years , modern warfare has changed from predominantly large - scale clashes of armies to messy civil strife , ” wrote Dando , citing the Bosnian conflict of the mid-1990s and current fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Chemical agents and even gene therapy being developed in civilian life science laboratories “ are particularly suited to this style of warfare ; it is not hard to find people in the military world who think they would be useful , ” he declared .
Dando , Professor of International Security at Britain ’s Bradford University , is a regular participant in U.N. - sponsored arms conferences and is due in Geneva next week for a meeting of experts on the 1972 biological weapons pact .
But in Nature , he said attention should be focused on changing the 1993 global Chemical Weapons Convention ( CWC ) .
“ The CWC urgently needs modifying if it is to continue to help ensure that the modern life sciences are not used for hostile purposes , ” he wrote .
Most pressing was how the pact dealt with non-lethal chemicals developed for law enforcement .
“ LOVE AND CUDDLE ” DRUGS
Currently the CWC , which went into effect in 1997 and to which 188 countries are signatories , bans all chemical weapons but excludes those used for law enforcement and riot control .
“ ‘ Law enforcement ’ could be taken by some to cover more than domestic riot control , which in certain circumstances would make it legal for the military to use agents such as fentanyl , ” said Dando , referring to a powerful painkilling drug .
Fentanyl , a strong painkiller , Dando said , was deployed in a still unrevealed mixture by Russian special forces in 2002 to subdue Chechen militants who had seized a Moscow theater .
But its use led to the deaths of over 120 hostages among the theater - goers and Russian commandoes who went into the theater with protective gear shot dead the incapacitated hostage - takers .
Other agents being developed , said Dando , include oxytocin , dubbed the “ love and cuddle ” chemical which induces trust and whose emergence “ opens up the possibility of a drug that could be used to manipulate people ’s emotions in a military context . ”
Although some backers of this idea argue that using incapacitating drugs as weapons could stop people being killed in conflicts , the scientist said , historical evidence like that of the Russian siege suggested otherwise .
Dando said he was alarmed what he called a lack of engagement with the issue among life scientists whom he had questioned in some 13 countries around the world .
“ They are just not taking the problem on board , ” he told Reuters .
Dando was not optimistic that changes to the CCW , next up for review in 2013 , could be agreed by then .
“ It is a long diplomatic process and it is not clear that even governments fully recognize the problem , ” he said in a telephone interview .
The health insurance bill , AB 2 by Assemblyman Hector De La Torre ( D - South Gate ) , addressed a practice known as rescission , a practice The Times has reported extensively about .
It can involve insurance companies removing patients with serious , costly illnesses from their rolls retroactively .
The governor vetoed 229 of the bills , but did not carry through on his threat to reject hundreds more as punishment for legislative leaders ' failure to reach a bipartisan deal on upgrading the state 's water system .
Schwarzenegger said sufficient progress had been made in the water talks to move the bills off his desk .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed a measure that would have restricted the ability of insurance companies to cancel the policies of sick patients and signed into law a bill honoring Harvey Milk as he rushed to act on 704 bills before their midnight signing deadline Sunday .
Congressional investigators uncovered cases in which insurance officials were rewarded by their companies for finding excuses -- such as a form being filled out incompletely during enrollment -- to take policies away from some of the sickest patients .
Schwarzenegger said he supports protecting such patients but state regulators have implemented reforms that are doing so , significantly decreasing the number of rescissions since 2005 .
" The market has changed -- and it is because of my Administration ’s strong action in this area , " he wrote in his veto message .
He also criticized provisions of the bill that he said benefited " trial lawyers rather than consumers . "
Other bills he rejected included bids to force any extension of the 710 Freeway to be done underground , ban pay hikes for top administrators at public universities in bad budget years and tighten oversight on fertility clinics .
Those he signed included a measure to create a day of recognition for gay activist and political leader Harvey Milk , one intended to combat human trafficking and an anti-drunk - driving bill requiring DUI offenders in some counties to install devices in their vehicles that test blood - alcohol content before the vehicles can be started .
Schwarzenegger also called a special legislative session on water to start this week .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Michael Jackson ’s posthumous movie “ This Is It ” has sparked a huge amount of speculation over what will be in it and the reasons for making it , but one thing is certain if the late pop star himself is to be believed -- God had a hand in its production .
Entertainment Weekly magazine on Thursday revealed details about the making of the film , saying the series of planned London concerts on which it is based featured 22 different stage sets , aerial dancing and magic .
Jackson even wanted a reproduction of the world ’s largest waterfall , the Victoria Falls in Africa , before producers balked .
“ God channels this through me at night .
I ca n’t sleep because I ’m so supercharged , ” the 50 - year - old “ Thriller ” singer told his director , Kenny Ortega .
Ortega asked : “ Ca n’t God take a vacation ? ”
“ You do n’t understand -- if I ’m not there to receive these ideas , God might give them to Prince , ” Jackson answered , referring to the rival pop star .
Jackson died in June of a prescription drug overdose before the London concerts hit the stage .
His estate ’s administrators , concert promoter AEG Live and movie studio Sony Pictures Entertainment agreed to use video footage of the shows ’ rehearsals to make the movie .
The film , which is part concert film and part documentary of his last days , hits theaters worldwide on October 28 for a two - week run .
When Jackson died , he was reported to be as much as $ 400 million in debt and his Neverland Ranch had been sold , leading to reports he needed to perform solely for the money .
But AEG
Live president Randy Phillips told Entertainment Weekly that Jackson was doing it for his three children .
“ I asked him , ‘ why now ? ’.
He said ‘ Because I ’ve spent 12 and a half years bringing my kids up , and now they ’re old enough to appreciate what I do -- and I ’m still young enough to do it , ’ ” Phillips said .
Scientists say they have made a dramatic breakthrough in understanding the cause of chronic fatigue syndrome – a debilitating condition affecting 250,000 people in Britain which for decades has defied a rational medical explanation .
The researchers have discovered a strong link between chronic fatigue syndrome , which is sometimes known as ME or myalgic encephalomyelitis , and an obscure retrovirus related to a group of viruses found to infect mice .
Although the published data falls short of proving a definitive cause - and - effect , one of the scientists behind the study said last night that she was confident that further unpublished data she had gathered over the past few weeks implicated the retrovirus as an important and perhaps sole cause of the condition .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Chronic fatigue syndrome has blighted the lives of an estimated 17 million people worldwide because its symptoms , long - term tiredness and aching limbs , do not go away with sleep or rest .
Famous sufferers have included the author and yachtswoman Clare Francis , the film director Lord Puttnam , the pop singer Suzanne Shaw and the Labour politician Yvette Cooper , who has made a full recovery .
The condition initially generated much controversy in the 1980s , when it was known as " yuppie flu " , because some medical authorities even doubted whether it was a genuine physical illness .
In the absence of a proven cause , many scientists have questioned whether there could ever be one reason behind so many different symptoms , so the latest research showing a strong link to a single virus has generated intense excitement among experts .
The study , published in the journal Science , shows that the virus , called murine leukaemia virus - related virus ( XMRV ) , was found in 68 of 101 patients from around the US with chronic fatigue syndrome .
This compared with just eight of 218 healthy " controls " drawn at random from the same parts of the US , the scientists said .
But the senior author of the study , Judy Mikovits , director of research at the Whittemore Peterson Institute in Reno , Nevada , said further blood tests have revealed that more than 95 per cent of patients with the syndrome have antibodies to the virus – indicating they have been infected with XMRV , which can lie dormant within a patient 's DNA .
" With those numbers , I would say , yes we 've found the cause of chronic fatigue syndrome .
We also have data showing that the virus attacks the human immune system , " said Dr Mikovits .
She is testing a further 500 blood samples gathered from chronic fatigue patients diagnosed in London .
" The same percentages are holding up , " she said .
If the findings are replicated by other groups and the XMRV virus is accepted as a cause of chronic fatigue syndrome then it could be possible to treat patients with antivirals , just like treating HIV , or to develop a vaccine against the virus to protect people from developing the condition , said Dr Mikovits .
" We now have compelling proof that a retrovirus named XMRV is present in more than two - thirds of patient samples with chronic fatigue syndrome .
This finding could be a major step in the discovery of vital treatment options for millions of patients , " she said .
The genetic structure of the XMRV virus indicates that it has evolved from a similar virus found in wild field mice .
Dr Mikovits suggested it could have jumped the " species barrier " from mouse to man like many other human viruses , such as HIV , another retrovirus , which is thought to have infected humans from monkeys or apes .
XMRV was originally found in men suffering from prostate cancer and it was this discovery that led Dr Mikovits and her collaborators at the US National Institutes of Health to test blood samples stored from patients with chronic fatigue syndrome .
" The discovery of XMRV in two major diseases , prostate cancer and now chronic fatigue syndrome , is very exciting .
If cause - and - effect is established , there would be a new opportunity for prevention and treatment of these diseases , " said Professor Robert Silverman , of the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio , who worked on the fatigue syndrome study .
However , other researchers emphasised that the numbers published so far are too small to conclude anything about the cause of chronic fatigue syndrome .
" It 's spectacular but needs replication .
And I hope that no one is thinking of prescribing anti-retrovirals on the basis of this , " said Simon Wessely , professor of psychological medicine at King 's College London .
" It 's very preliminary and there no evidence to say this is relevant to the vast majority of people in the UK with the condition . "
US and Egyptian authorities have charged 100 people in what the director of the FBI has called " the largest international phishing case ever conducted " .
The US and Egyptian fraudsters were accused of using phishing scams to steal account details from hundreds , possibly thousands , of people , and transferring about $ 1.5 million into fake accounts they controlled .
The group of fraudsters were accused of targeting US financial institutions and victimising a number of account holders by fraudulently using their personal financial information after they were successfully phished .
The arrests were the result of an investigation called Operation Phish Phry ' .
Starting in 2007 , FBI agents worked with US financial institutions to " identify and disrupt " criminal phishing gangs .
" This international phishing ring had a significant impact on two banks and caused huge headaches for hundreds , perhaps thousands of bank customers , " said Acting US Attorney George S. Cardona , in a statement .
" Organised , international crime rings can only be confronted by an organised response by law enforcement across international borders , which we have seen in this case . "
American authorities charged 53 people , while Egypt charged 47 , with offences including conspiracy to commit bank fraud , computer fraud , money laundering and aggravated identity theft .
The bank fraud alone could lead to jail sentences of 20 years .

Former lawyer Jack Thompson has sued Facebook for allowing anti-Thompson groups to post messages that have caused him " great harm and distress . "
Thompson was permanently disbarred in September 2008 but that did n't stop his vocal criticism of the videogame industry , nor did it soften the attitude of videogamers toward Thompson and his strident rhetoric , many of whom have come together in Facebook groups to share their frustration with his antics .
But Thompson says he feels threatened by some of the messages posted by those groups and on Tuesday , he filed suit against Facebook for letting it happen .
There are hundreds of Thompson - related Facebook groups , according to SFGate.com ; one potentially dangerous group that 's mentioned in his suit is named " Jack Thompson should be smacked across the face with an Atari 2600 . "
He also cited a message posted by a user who offered to pay $ 50 to anyone who sent him a video of themselves punching Thompson in the face .
He said his situation is similar to that of U.S. President Barack Obama , who was recently the subject of another Facebook controversy caused by a poll asking whether or not he should be shot .
Facebook administrators quickly removed the poll but as Thompson noted , " Unlike our President , Thompson does not have the Secret Service to protect him . "
But Thompson 's suit against Facebook , like most of his others , has little chance of going anywhere , according to WiredSafety.org Executive Director Parry Aftab , who noted that the U.S. Communications Decency
Act exempts services like Facebook from liability for what people do with them .
" They are no more liable than the phone company would be for anyone who is calling in a ransom demand , " she said .
Regardless of the legal merits of his case , however , this is n't the sort of attention gamers need .
It may seem like a joke to anyone familiar with Thompson ( although in the case of the $ 50 face - punch bounty , it 's hard to say there 's not some measure of seriousness involved ) but to those on the outside looking in , it can appear more serious .
Would anyone ever smack Thompson across the face with an Atari 2600 ?
Of course not .
( Those things cost money , you know . )
But without context , it looks like a threat ; and we , the gamers , end up looking like juvenile idiots or , worse , the violent psychos Thompson has worked so hard to make us out to be .
Thompson never learned how to tone it down and it cost him his career .
We do n't need to make the same mistake .

A PAIR of rabid rabbits has been caught killing a series of snakes near Cairns .
For three weeks Armando Del Manso believed his dog was responsible for the dead snakes showing up with teeth marks all over them on his East Barron property ’s lawn each morning .
But it turns out it was a pair of rampaging rabbits killing the snakes .
The 42 - year - old boilermaker first made the discovery Tuesday night when he spotted the two wild rabbits attacking a king brown snake .
“ The snake was raised up in the air in the striking position and the two rabbits worked their way around him and killed him in two minutes , ” Mr Del Manso said .
“ I ’m gobsmacked , it ’s absolutely incredible .
“ We were watching from the veranda with a spotlight , and I thought , who is going to believe this , they ’ll think I ’m crazy . ”
Wildlife expert Paul O’Callaghan of the Cairns Wildlife Safari said it was the first time he had heard of rabbits attacking snakes .
The report also met with disbelief from a number of cairns.com .au readers .

I tell you what , I love me some Google Reader .
One of the first things I did when I got my phone was set up a shortcut to Readerâ€™s mobile interface .
Itâ€™s fairly robust , but it is in the browser , so itâ€™s a little slow even on WiFi .
On Edge , itâ€™s unbearable .
And forget about offline access .
What I needed was an app .
But now that there are several to choose from , Iâ€™m still using that shortcut to the browser .
Why ?
They are 3rd party apps that ask for my Google login information .
Iâ€™m sure these developers are nice folks and not the least bit interested in identity theft , but I just canâ€™t get past the idea of giving them access to not only my primary email account ( Gmail ) , not only confidential documents ( Google Docs ) , but also the power to spend my money ( Google Checkout ) .
Letâ€™s take a look at a few apps
Iâ€™d really like to use , but wonâ€™t .
Greed was the first Google Reader app I came across .
A friend of mine recommended it to me .
He loves it .
I wonâ€™t use it , because it asks for my Google login information .
And dude , itâ€™s called Greed .
Doesnâ€™t exactly make me feel great about giving the app my login info .
NewsRob was the next Reader app I found .
It gets great reviews .
I have no doubt that itâ€™s wonderful .
But I wonâ€™t use it , because it asks for my Google login information .
The latest Reader app I wonâ€™t use is Talking RSS Reader , which uses a synthesized voice to speak items from your Google Reader feeds to you .
I thought itâ€™d be nice to use in the car .
But it wants my Google login info , so I wo n’t be using it .
It goes beyond Google Reader , of course .
Iâ€™d love to use GDocs for Android to access my Google Docs .
But I wonâ€™t .
You know why by now , right ?
m Analytics is one of several apps out there that allow you to keep track of your Google Analytics account on your Android phone .
I , of course , will not use any of them .
So whose fault is this ?
I know , many of you might say itâ€™s my fault .
Iâ€™m just being paranoid .
I should stop worrying and learn to love giving out my Google login info .
Some might say itâ€™s Googleâ€™s fault , for making the same password that gets you into Reader also work for Gmail and Checkout .
But that integration is a feature , too , and Google does support OAuth .
I hate to lay the blame on developers , but wouldnâ€™t it be great if , the first time you opened an app like NewsRob , it took you to a page on Googleâ€™s servers in the browser to authorize the app ?
I admit , my knowledge is pretty incomplete here , and there may be reasons why you canâ€™t use OAuth for these purposes .
But even failing OAuth , there is another way .
Letâ€™s look at a couple more apps : little olâ€™ Reader Widget Small , and its big brother , Reader Widget Pro.
Both are widgets that provide basic info about your Google Reader account ( number of unread items and recent headlines ) .
Both use â€ œAutomatic authorization against Google Reader API , â€ so no login information is required .
In other words , my phone is already hooked up with my Google account , and this app takes advantage of that to eliminate the need for users to turn over the keys to their house to some guy who says he wonâ€™t take anything .
Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™m not the only one who is concerned about this sort of thing .
I have to think thereâ€™s an audience out there for apps that access various Google services without requiring users to provide login info .
What do you think ?
Am I being paranoid , or just appropriately cautious ?
And if youâ€™re a developer with some insight into hurdles Iâ€™m unaware of , please let me know in the comments .
Update :
The developer of ReaderScope , one of those Google Reader apps that I would not use , took this post to heart and pushed an update out today that enables auto - login .
Credentialing works the same as in the Reader Widget apps , and there ’s also the option to supply login info if your Reader login is different than the one associated with your phone .
In his post about the update , he also explains that Google only supports OAuth for webapps , not for mobile or desktop apps , and that the solution he did use is not perfect : it will only work on “ Google experience ” phones .
I tested it out and auto - login worked perfectly .
The app seems nice , though I ’ve not had a chance yet to put it through its paces .
So , I now have a Google Reader app I can use .
That ’s wonderful , but the larger issue remains .
Public transport may not play a large role in transmitting swine flu .
Buses may be safer than babies , at least when it comes to swine flu .
Preliminary results from an online flu survey suggest that contact with children poses one of the greatest swine flu risk factors , while the use of public transport seems surprisingly safe .
The UK flu survey , developed by a team of epidemiologists at the London School for Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , has been running since July this year , collecting data on swine flu symptoms from volunteers who regularly update their health status and patterns of social contacts online ( see Plus article Swine flu uncertainty ) .
Over 5,000 UK residents have now signed up with the survey .
Out of those who have reported swine flu - like symptoms , around 70 % said they had frequent contact with children , compared to only around 55 % of those who 've remained healthy .
Respondents who 've become ill also tend to live in households with around 50 % more children under 5 than those who have n't yet caught the disease .
This was to be expected , as children are far more vulnerable to the disease than adults .
Overall , the results indicate that swine flu spreads through social interaction , as people who become ill tend to live in larger households and have slightly more face - to - face and physical contacts than those who do n't .
However , it seems that simply sitting on a bus is relatively safe : a breakdown of public transport usage for those who 've reported swine flu symptoms compared to those who have n't shows very little difference between the two groups .
Two other potential risk factors — frequent contact with the elderly and frequent contact with patients — also appear to be safe , as roughly the same proportion of healthy people and people who 've been ill have recorded such contacts .
Swine flu in the news
For almost six months now swine flu has hardly been out of the news .
We 'd like to find out where you found the most useful information on swine flu .
Did the media do well reporting on the virus ?
What about government information ?
Or did you go to see your GP to find out what to do about swine flu ?
Please take part in this quick poll to tell us what you think , or tell us exactly what information was useful , or a nuisance , by posting a comment at the end of this article !
Where did you find the most useful information about swine flu ?
poll
While the results of the survey are preliminary — a larger sample and more statistical analysis are needed to confirm the trends that have emerged — it has already proved itself to be ahead of the game in one important aspect : the survey found that individuals in the over - 65 age group who had not been vaccinated against ordinary seasonal flu were three times more likely to have experienced swine flu symptoms than those who had been vaccinated .
This suggests that the ordinary seasonal flu vaccine affords some immunity against swine flu , even though it was n't specifically designed for it .
The result has since been confirmed by independent research .
Perhaps most importantly , the survey found no evidence of man flu .
While the results show that men are slightly less likely than women to see their GP or take medication ( perhaps indicating that they 're just whingeing ) , they are no more likely to take time off work when they think they are ill than women .
This suggests that if man flu does exist , it is confined to making a fuss at home .
With the autumn flu season just about to start , and the government preparing to roll out its vaccination programme , swine flu is likely to remain in the news headlines for some time to come .
Epidemiology is an intensely mathematical area , and the way it 's being reported on in the media is a subject close to our hearts here at Plus .
So before we add our own bit to the media coverage ( in a series of articles to be published later this year ) we 'd like to know who you think has given you the most useful information on swine flu .

Sydney Town Hall in the 1950s .
Recent electoral victories in Australia by socialists at the municipal council level -- the Socialist Party 's Stephen Jolly in Victoria and Socialist Alliance 's Sam Wainwright in Western Australia -- have sparked renewed interest in the experiences of other socialists who have been elected to such bodies .
With permission of the Rough Reds Collective , Links International Journal of Socialist Renewal is publishing Beverley Symons ' paper that examines the example of Communist Party of Australia members elected to the Sydney City Council in the 1950s .
This article first appeared in the 2003 book A Few Rough Reds , published by the Australian Society for the Study of Labour History , Canberra Region Branch .

By Beverley Symons
As is well known , the Communist Party of Australia ( CPA ) was represented in an Australian parliament only once , by Fred Paterson in the Queensland state seat of Bowen from 1944 - 50 .
However , the party 's electoral successes in local government have attracted little historical attention .
As far as I know , the only published material outside the communist press were two articles in 1985 and 1986 examining the CPA 's 1944 victory in winning five of the eight seats on the Kearsley Shire Council in the northern New South Wales coalfields .
During a period of over 30 years , CPA councillors held office in numerous city and municipal councils in several states .
The first , Fred Paterson and Jim Henderson , were elected in April 1939 to the Townsville City Council and Wangaratta Shire Council respectively ; and the last -- Bill Flynn and Bill Whiley , who were on Broken Hill Council for 21 and 12 years -- were defeated in October 1974 .
Subsequently , some Communist Party members have been elected to councils -- such as Jack Mundey and Brian McGahen to the Sydney City Council in 1984 -- however , they stood as community independents and not for the CPA .
Of comparable significance to the Kearsley wartime victory is that , throughout the Cold War 1950s with its prevailing anti-communism , the party continued to achieve electoral successes in local government .
In the NSW municipal elections in December 1953 , eight CPA candidates were elected -- two to the Sydney City Council , one to outer - suburban Penrith Council and five to the country councils of Lithgow , Cessnock , Lake Macquarie , Broken Hill and Binnaway .
Three of these councillors served only one term , two served for six years , two for eight or nine years and one for 21 years .
This paper examines the experiences of the two communists elected to the Sydney City Council for the first time , Tom Wright and Ron Maxwell .
At the time of their election , Wright , 51 , was NSW secretary and federal president of the Sheet Metal Workers ’ Union and had led the NSW branch for 17 years .
He was the CPA ’s general secretary for four years in the 1920s and since then , had continued to be a leading member of its central committee .
Maxwell , 42 , a waterside worker , was a senior vice - president of the Waterside Workers ’ Federation , Sydney Branch and had been a party member for 10 years .
Given that the 1953 municipal elections occurred only two years after the CPA had narrowly escaped being declared illegal , it seems pretty remarkable that it was able to break through the anti-communist barriers and gain entry to the aldermen 's chambers in the Sydney City Council .

Lemma The Ultimate ⊢ Weblog
An experiment in using GitHub for collaborative blog authorship with posts themed broadly around functional programming with an emphasis on topics like verification , theorem proving , and mathematical properties ( ... also an obvious pun on the legendary Lambda the Ultimate ) .
How Does It Work
There is n't much too it .
The minimalist approach was inspired by Reginald 's homoiconic blog .
To make a post , simply add a Markdown file in the directory posts / ( e.g. posts / you - had - me- at - curry.md ) .
If you have supplementary material such as source code , that can be put in a directory of the same name ( e.g. posts / you - had - me- at - curry / Curry.agda ) .
Why
I wanted hassle free blogging , but do n't put out enough content myself .
Hopefully with the help of a community of contributors , seeing others add content will motivate everyone to think and share .
I Want You
To contribute you only need a text editor , Git installed , and a GitHub account .
To get write access to this repository , ask @larrytheliquid or get in contact with someone on the organization 's member list .
To work on in - progress posts , just push up a branch named after your username ( e.g. larrytheliquid ) .
When you 're happy with a post , merge and push to master .
Do n't fret about maintaining a clean
Git history , the whole idea is to try to encourage creating content and not get sidetracked by superficial details .
If you do n't have Git or prefer the convenience of the browser , editing documents with prose .
io is quite pleasant .
Anything Goes
Contribute even small posts or underdeveloped ideas .
It 's all too easy to start a blog and never publish anything because you do n't think it 's mature enough .
Experiment
As mentioned above , this is an experiment so feel free to not follow the outline above too .
For example , if you are more comfortable with forking the repo ( rather than creating a branch for your username ) , and issuing pull requests then have at it .
From our press release about the news :
The advertising boycott of Glenn Beck has cost the controversial host over half of his estimated advertising revenue since it was launched by ColorOfChange.org a month ago .
This according to data analyzed from industry sources .
Estimated advertising revenue [ the total amount of advertising money being spent during a block of commercial time for a program ] was collected on a week - by - week basis for a period of two months .
According to the data collected , the amount of money spent by national advertisers on Beck 's program per week was at its highest at approximately $ 1,060,000 , for the week ending August 2 , 2009 .
ColorOfChange.org launched their campaign at the end of that week and since then , 62 advertisers have distanced themselves from Beck .
Data collected for the week ending September 6 , 2009 shows Beck 's estimated ad revenue at $ 492,000 , equal to a loss of $ 568,000 .
" Fox News Channel has consistently claimed they have n't lost revenue as advertisers abandon Glenn Beck , but the numbers prove otherwise , " said James Rucker , Executive Director of ColorOfChange.org .
" Fox News Channel has a limited amount of ad positions .
If 62 companies refuse to run ads on two of their 24 hours of programming , they are losing inventory .
No matter how high Beck 's ratings have been lately , advertisers still see Beck as toxic and do n't want him associated with their brands .
There is no way that Fox News Channel is making the money they should be making with Glenn Beck . "
Our campaign is working .
Respectable companies do n't want to be associated with Beck or support his show with their dollars .
It 's resulting in a major loss of funding for his show , and at the same time making it clear that Beck 's race - baiting and fear - mongering are far outside the mainstream .
The longer Beck stays isolated , the more of a problem he 'll be for Fox , and the less he 'll be able to spread his lies and distortions .
If we can keep the pressure on , Fox will have to make a choice : 1 ) drop Beck because it does n't make business sense to keep him ; or 2 ) communicate to the world that they 're so intent on providing a platform for race - baiting and fear - mongering that they do n't care if they lose money ( a serious problem for a public company like News Corporation , the owner of Fox ) .
Thanks for everything you 've done to make this effort a success -- none of it could have happened without the more than 200,000 of you who have stepped up to be a part of this campaign .
More than ever , it 's time to keep the pressure on .
You can help by joining us in thanking the advertisers that have stopped supporting Glenn Beck , and calling on those whose ads are still running on his show to follow suit .
Up to 85 % of Arabs in greater Israel stem from Jewish ancestors .
Some of them want to become fully Jewish , most are scared to even talk about it .
Up to 85 percent of Arabs in greater Israel stem from Jewish ancestors , it is estimated .
Some of them want to become fully Jewish , but most are scared to even talk about it .
“ In our search for the lost Ten Tribes in India and Afghanistan , we seem to have forgotten to look for their descendants in our very own backyard . ”
So says the narrator in a new film about the efforts of a former hi-tech pioneer named Tzvi MiSinai to search out the Jewish roots of Israel 's Arab enemies – and to inform them of their Judaic heritage .
Email readers please click here to see the video footage .
MiSinai has spent about a half - million shekels , he estimates , on these efforts .
They include visiting dangerous places deep inside Palestinian Authority - controlled territory , hearing the stories of Arabs who remember observing Jewish customs , and distributing literature to Jews and Arabs alike .
One Arab says his father told him the secret of his family ’s Jewishness on his deathbed , while another one , on the backdrop of a photo of the saintly Cabalistic sage Rabbi Abuchatzeira on his wall , says their roots have been known in his family for generations .
Wrapping what apparently used to be kosher tefillin on his arm , he says , “ My father used to do this , and he taught us to do it whenever someone was sick or in trouble . ”
The Jews Who Didn't Leave
It is generally accepted that most Jews left the Land of Israel after the failed Bar Kokhba revolt in 135 CE .
Yet many remained , and of these , many are still here , after having been forced to convert to Islam .
“ It turns out that a large part of the Arabs of the Land of Israel are actually descendants of forced converts to Islam over the years , ” says Rabbi Dov Stein of the nascent Sanhedrin rabbinical council .
“ There are some studies that say that 85 percent of the Arabs in Israel are descended from Jews ; others say there are fewer . ”
Ben-Gurion Agrees
The claims are not new .
Early Zionist leaders David Ben-Gurion and Yitzchak Ben - Tzvi wrote in a book 100 years ago : “ If we investigate the origins of the Felahim , there is no doubt that much Jewish blood runs in their veins . ”
The authors implied that these Jews loved the Land so much that they were willing to give up their religion .
The reference is probably to an edict in the year 1012 by Caliph el - Hakim , who ordered the non-Muslims to either convert or leave the Land of Israel .
It is estimated that 90 percent of the Jews chose the former , though many continued to practice Judaism in secret .
The decree was revoked 32 years later - apparently too late for about 75 percent of the converts .
Tzvi MiSinai continues to convince Arabs in Judea and Samaria that they are likely Jewish .
The film shows him passing through the Gush Etzion checkpoint and distributing pamphlets both to Israeli soldiers – “ so that you ’ll know who you ’re checking here ” – and to the Arabs waiting there – “ so that you ’ll know who the majority of you are . ”
Asked by an Arab if he is from the peace movement , MiSinai answers , “ Yes , yes , peace , so that we can live together as one nation . ”
The Sawarka Bedouin Jews
One place where MiSinai has apparently found very strong Jewish roots is in the Bedouin tribe known as the Sawarka .
There are about 3-4,000 of them throughout the Sinai and the Negev , and they “ are all Jewish , ” says a tribal leader in perfect Hebrew .
With his face camouflaged for the cameras , the Bedouin says , “ They had no choice but to convert ; this was centuries ago …
I remember my mother and grandmother would n’t light fire on Sabbath , and they had a special mikveh … ”
Others , in a Bedouin village east of Hebron , also remember burning a small piece of dough ( reminiscent of the Biblical command to separate a small piece of dough when baking bread ) , lighting candles at graves , and tearing clothes and sitting shiva for seven days , and not three as is Muslim practice .
Even today , ritual circumcisions are carried out after the seventh day of birth .
Many homes in some of the Arab villages have doorpost indentations for a Mezuzah , with a scroll placed in some of them .
In another village just south of Hevron , Muhammed Amsalem – a descendant of Spanish Jews - told Aharon Granot of Mishpacha magazine that everyone in town knows he and his clan are Jews : “ Our elders tell us that our forefathers came to this land during the [ 15th century ] Spanish Inquisition , via Morocco .
They settled in Ramle .
Then the Mamluks forced them to convert to Islam , and they moved to the South Hevron area . ”
Amsalem says they decided to reveal their Jewish roots after the 1967 Six Day War when they learned that a Jewish community had been reestablished in Hevron .
“ But the Jews saw we had no knowledge of their religious practices and refused to accept us …
If the Jewish community would be willing to receive us today , we would join them with great enthusiasm . ”
In the area of the South Hevron Hills , half of the Arabs are aware of the Jewish origins .
They used to talk about it openly , though no longer .
One man who recently publicized a silver Chanukah menorah that had been passed down to him from his father and previous generations was hung by terrorists by his feet for six weeks , leaving him with permanent injuries .
Genetic Studies Back Claims
At the Hadassah Medical School labs , Prof. Ariela Oppenheim of Hebrew University performed an international genetic study that backs up conclusions of Jewish - Arab genetic similarities .
“ We found that despite the dispersion of Jews around the world for 2,000 years , they essentially kept their Jewish continuity , ” Oppenheim said .
“ In addition , we found that the Jewish population is surprisingly close , genetically , to the Arabs living here in Israel . ”
She said that the study shows that both the Arabs of Israel and the Jews are descended from the Kurds of Aram in Babylon – the birthplace of the Patriarch Abraham .
“ It ’s clear that we ’re all from the same family , ” Oppenheim concludes .
“ Most unfortunately , however , there are conflicts even within families , and sometimes brothers fight as well .
I wish this is what will bring the Redemption , but I ’m very sad to say that I do n’t think so . ”
Some Want to Return to Observant Judaism
South of Hevron , in Yatta , there is a large formerly - Jewish presence – and some even want to return to active Judaism .
It is widely known there that half the residents are of the originally - Jewish Mahamra clan – a name that means “ winemaker , ” a trade that is forbidden according to Islam .
“ The people in these areas converted to Islam later in history , ” MiSinai says , “ and therefore more customs and knowledge and artifacts have been preserved . ”
These include Jewish stars over the entrances to homes , while in at least one house , the family has hidden a mezuzah and tefillin in creative hiding spots .
One man pulled out a small Hebrew booklet of Psalms and Tanya with which he says he continues to secretly pray .
Miro Cohen , a Jew from Tekoa , in eastern Gush Etzion , is very friendly with the Arabs in a nearby village known as Kawazbe – a name that he and they agree is merely a corruption of Kuzeiba , the original name of the famous Bar Kokhba .
“ These people are the descendants of Bar Kokhba , ” Cohen declares .
One Arab sitting with him can count his ancestors eight generations back , ending with a grandfather named Kawazbeh .
Another village elder says openly that his grandfather was a Jew who converted to Islam .
Some of the residents want to return to Judaism ; they do n’t call it converting , because they are “ already Jewish . ”
On the other hand , Arabs with the name Kawazbeh have been arrested for terrorist activity against Israel .
Other areas where Arabs of Jewish descent reside are Kfar Anzah in Samaria , Samoa in southern Judea , villages in the Tel Arad area , and more .
Rabbi Stein says , “ We know that up to about 200 years ago , the Galilee village of Sakhnin was a Jewish town , with an active synagogue .
The Turks pressured them to convert to Islam , but the people there know that they are of Jewish origins . ”
For a while now , Tom Waits has been threatening to drop a live album document of his 2008 Glitter and Doom tour on us .

Glitter and Doom is due November 24 from Anti- , and it 'll be two discs , on CD and vinyl .
Disc one is programmed like one evening 's setlist , even though it pulls together songs taped at 10 separate shows .
Disc two , meanwhile , is entirely Tom Waits stage patter !
Yes , " Tom Tales " is one long track of incredibly charismatic surreal gutbucket rambling .
Take that , Robert Pollard and Elvis !
Time to update those Christmas lists , kids .
Waits ' website is currently offering the album 's first eight tracks for free download .
Head here to cop those tracks .
The preview is exactly as inscrutably bizarre as you 'd hope a Waits live album would be , but it still makes room for the heart - wrecked ballad " Fannin Street " .

Spectacular Spider-man Figure Review
| By
Despite the fact that I have far too many collections started , I ’ve taken it upon myself to find a new collection to start .
I decided this seemingly on a whim and thought the new animated Spectacular Spider - man figures might be a good place to start .
The new Spider - man toys are everywhere I go and despite originally not liking the redesigns of so many classic characters , something about them finally wore me down and won me over .
There are a ton of “ regular ” Spider - mans on the market for this line , so I did a little bit of research to find out which one is supposedly the best .
I stumbled across this version of Spider - man which is earning the nickname of multi-jointed or super articulated Spider-man .
Although I ’m not a big fan of tons of articulation on certain figures , I feel Spider - man is the guy who definitely needs lot of articulation so this is the version I picked up .
After playing around with him for a little while , I ’m not sure if this line is for me or not .
Packaging :
If you ’ve been to any store in the past year or so that sells toys you ’ve probably seen these packages on the shelf .
They feature Spider - man in the top corner in his animated form and the colors are bright and attractive .
They just recently relaunched the figure line with this new subset of “ SPIDER - CHARGED ” figures which all feature a little plastic spider in the lower corner of the bubble .
I ’m not really sure what the point of this is other than to be able to re-release some old figures and some repaints , but I do n’t really have a problem with that .
The back of the package shows off some of the other Spider - Charged guys and gives a little bio .
It ’s all pretty standard and fairly effective .
This is actually the figure on the back , which is nice because the first few series actually featured prototype figures on the back that looked much different than the figure in the package .
Never a good thing .
There are no twist ties or rubber bands , but Spider - man ’s arms are a little warped in the package .
Because of the flexible plastic used in the figure it is n’t as worrisome as some of the bigger figures that get warped , but it ’s not exactly pleasing either .
Articulation :
If you ’ve ever read any of my other reviews here you ’ve probably heard me use the phrase “ This guy ai n’t Spider - man … ” when I point out that so few figures need tons of articulation .
In this case , it IS Spider - man so all of his articulation makes sense .
I wish I could say that I love it , but I really do n’t .
The articulation is good , but the added pivot joint in the shoulders is useless .
The ball joint in the shoulders does n’t work very well and Spider - man ca n’t put his arms at his sides .
I have a real hard time making Spider - man just stand up posed normal .
Granted , this is Spider - man so he probably should n’t just be standing around , but some of the posing issues did bother me .
However if you ’re not a freak like me and do n’t want Spider - man standing around normal , then this figure will probably tickle you pink .
Spider - man can get into all sorts of poses , he can even cross his legs Indian style .
I ’m quite impressed with the level of posability even if he ca n’t put his arms at his sides .
I ’m still getting the hang of posing him and I can’t figure out if all his poses look he ’s playing air guitar or if I keep posing him like he ’s playing air guitar .
There are a ton of joints to be had here and some of them like the “ ab crunch ” joint do n’t do much .
However , he can definitely fit in a ton of positions and he ’s got a decent sense of stability .
Just look at that pose on one leg .
The figure is made of an almost rubbery plastic which is both good and bad for the posing .
Sometimes I found myself bending the plastic rather than the joint .
Sculpt :
I actually have seen very little of the new cartoon show , so much so that I still call it the “ new ” show and it ’s been out for quite a while now .
Still , I like to think this figure looks pretty accurate .
There are a ton of similar Spider - mans in this line , with some looking more round and human while others have more square angles and look more animated .
This one falls a bit inbetween .
Some of the joints are integrated a little clunky with ridges showing off .
He reminds me a bit of the 70’s Japanese Spider - man for some reason , but I think that works in his benefit .
The paint work is pretty crisp all around although I do have one tiny unpainted area on the center of his main spider symbol .
A little Sharpie could fix that .
This figure definitely looks pretty good for the source material and he ’s a solid sculpt of the figure .
I do think some of the ones with less articulation do look a little better .
That ’s pretty much the case with any figure though .
The less articulation , the better a figure looks .
Part of my issue with the old ToyBiz Marvel Legends was that they ’d often ruin a sculpt with too much articulation .
That ’s not necessarily the case here , but I might need a slightly less articulated Spider - man figure for me to truly judge if I like these figures or not .
For what he is though , he ’s pretty solid .
Accessories :
Call me crazy , but I actually like all the stupid costumes and accessories that most of these Spectacular Spider - man figures come with .
Usually it ’s some sort of weird flight costume or scuba gear , but most of them look pretty cool .
Sadly this Spider - man does n’t come with any of that cool stuff .
He gets a “ spider - charged ” spider that ’s a neat little 10 ¢ cent plastic spider .
It looks a bit like a black widow , but it ’s in Spider - man ’s traditional red and blue .
I do n’t know exactly what you could do with this , but I ’m sure I ’d found a use as a kid .
It definitely looks better than some of the other little spiders that are included with some of the other figures .
The rest of the accessories are pretty much crap .
He comes with two web blasters , which are giant and oversized .
Does Spider - man even use web blasters anymore ?
I figured Marvel completely retconned them after the movie .
Honestly , I ’d be fine if they did because although web blasters would occasionally give a plot point where Spider - man ran out of web , it makes more sense for him to have them naturally …
Even if real spiders shoot webs out their butt .
The web blasts that are included look like Mr. Peanut …
No kidding !
So maybe they ’re Planters blasters and not web blasters .
I think you could use the actual blasters as bombs or something in a diorama though .
Additional Notes :
I have n’t watched much of the show , but part of me thinks I should .
I hear good things and what I ’ve seen is alright .
I really liked the 90’s Animated Spider - man series .
It was pretty sweet and I collected a ton of those figures .
Interestingly it ’s the last time I really collected Spider - man toys of any kind .
Value :
Peter Parker ’s alter ego here was $ 11.99 at Toys R Us .
I ’m not really feeling that price point .
These usually run about $ 10.99 most everywhere else .
If the accessories included had been better I might not have felt the sting as bad , but given that this figure is somewhat rare I went ahead and bit the bullet on this guy .
He ’s more of a $ 7.99 kinda guy .
Score Recap :
Packaging – 7
Sculpting – 7
Articulation – 9
Accessories – Mr. Peanut Blasts , Web Blaster , Spider
Value – 6
Overall – 7 out of 10
I think I need a new rating system because I end up with 7 out of 10 more often than not .
I guess it ’s because so many figures have good some stuff and crappy other stuff .
I would n’t say this figure is crappy , but I do n’t love it .
There are other 7 out 10 ’s that I like a lot better .
I may or may not continue this line .
I want to review a few villains I think first .
And the wind cried …
Mar-y !
Anyone else collecting these guys ?
Should I continue ?
Love me ?
Hate me ?
Leave a comment below and I ’ll totally read it .
QuickTime
X is really cool and one of the many great improvements in Snow Leopard , but I was really surprised to find out that QuickTime X no longer automatically plays movie files on open , you ’d think since I just opened the file I ’d want to watch the movie !
Thankfully resolving this is just a matter of entering a command in the Terminal .
While digging around to figure this out I also uncovered some more QuickTime X hacks , like forcing QuickTime to stay full - screen even when it ’s in the background , or how to force the titlebar to always show or always hide .
Each one of these commands can be reversed by changing the value from 1 to 0 or vice versa
Autoplay QuickTime Movies on Open :
defaults write com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX MGPlayMovieOnOpen
1
Automatically show subtitles and closed captioning :
defaults write com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX MGEnableCCAndSubtitlesOnOpen
1
Never show titlebar :
defaults write com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX MGCinematicWindowDebugForceNoTitlebar 1
Always show title bar & controller :
defaults write com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX MGUIVisibilityNeverAutohide 1
Disable rounded corners in QuickTime X Player :

We have a lot of questions about this car , most of them whale penis leather - related , but in the bigger picture , this brazen finger - in - the - eye raises a good point , so to speak .
What makes a luxury vehicle ?
Things we used to think of as luxury - bovine leather , wood trim , high - end audio , etc. , have become mainstream .
Does it take exceptionally ridiculous material selection and bold ostentatious flair to define new luxury ?
Is it encapsulating yourself in a vehicle capable of taking a direct hit from a rocket propelled grenade ?
Does it mean emulating the wild excess of past luxury much like the Red Diamond is doing ?
Who knows .
But we 're betting the tzars would roll in one of these babies .

In July , conservatives complained that health care reform was happening too fast ; that there was n’t enough time to read the legislation before voting on it .
Now that they ’ve had the entire month of August , half of July , and eight days of September to read the legislation , I amfinding wingnuts out there who complain “ there has n’t been time to read this legislation ! ”
By my reckoning , HR 3200 — the bill from the House of Representatives that so many Blue Dogs and Republicans have foisted in the air as simplistic ridicule — has been available online for 55 days .
You can read it here as HTML and here as a PDF .
Yes , it ’s long — over 1,000 pages .
But if you ca n’t read twenty pages a day , then what in the world are you doing with an opinion of a document you ca n’t read ?!
It ’s par for the course : more than one Republican has admitted they have n’t read the bill and have no intention of reading it ; they already know what ’s in it , see , because Betsy McCaughey told them .
I realize this blog post is wasted electrons ; no one saying “ we have n’t had time ” will actually take the time .
They ’d rather be misinformed than occupy themselves with thought .
Hedge had denied the attacks , which took place in the 1990s A West Yorkshire vicar has been jailed for 14 years after being found guilty of raping two young boys and sexually attacking others .
The Reverend Peter Hedge , 47 , from Holy Trinity Church at Queensbury , near Bradford , had denied the attacks , which happened between the 1990s and 2000 .
A jury at Bradford Crown Court found him guilty of more than 30 indecent assaults as well as the rapes .
A judge said he was a " dreadful disgrace " to the church .
Hedge was also found guilty of another serious sexual assault .
' Deeply damaged '
The court heard the vicar abused his position of trust to gratify himself sexually with six boys and then paid them to keep silent .
The judge described Hedge 's actions as " calculated and systematic abuse " .
" He corrupted three of the boys with cannabis , his wickedness defied description , " he said .
" You [ Hedge ] scarred and blighted the lives of young boys who trusted you as a pastor and friend . "
Hedge was made subject to a sexual offences protection order and also put on the sex offenders register for life .
Det Sgt Linda Christie , from West Yorkshire Police 's child and public protection unit , said : " We are pleased with today 's verdict and hope it brings some closure to the victims of Peter Hedge .
" He abused his position of trust as a vicar and committed horrendous acts of abuse against vulnerable boys who trusted him . "
The Bishop of Bradford , the Right Reverend David James , said in a statement : " Clergy in the Church of England are expected to uphold the highest moral standards .
" By committing these very serious crimes , Peter Hedge has betrayed the trust put in him by the people of Thornbury and Queensbury .
" My thoughts and prayers are with the victims who have been deeply damaged by someone who should have been nurturing them and keeping them safe .
" And I thank them for their courage in coming forward to give evidence . "

AMD has announced the release of the first OpenCL SDK for x86 CPUs , and it will enable developers to target x86 processors with the kind of OpenCL code that 's normally written for GPUs .
In a way , this is a reverse of the normal " GPGPU " trend , in which programs that run on a CPU are modified to run in whole or in part on a GPU .
Why would you want to run GPU programs on a CPU ?
Debugging is one reason , if you do n't have access to an OpenCL - compliant GPU .
And for now , that 's essentially what 'll be doing , since the new SDK does n't appear to be able to target GPUs , yet .
But eventually , developers will be able to write in OpenCL and target multicore x86 CPUs alongside GPUs from NVIDIA , AMD , and Intel .
Of course , when you can write once and target a variety of parallel hardware types , the fact that Larrabee runs x86 will be irrelevant ; so Intel had better be able to scale up Larrabee 's performance , because its x86 support will not be a selling point ( at least for Larrabee as a GPU , though an HPC coprocessor might be a different story ) .
Note that you can already write once , run anywhere for GPUs and multicore x86 already , but you 'd have to use RapidMind 's proprietary middleware layer .
Because it 's more than just an API — the middleware does just - in - time compilation targeting whatever hardware is in the system , dynamic load - balancing , and real - time optimization — an OpenGL vs. RapidMind comparison is a little bit apples - to - oranges , but only just a bit .
In reality , few workloads are such that you can break them up in the design phase into parallel chunks so that a middleware layer can dynamically map them to hardware resources at run-time .
Certainly there are some problem domains that this works for — finance is one that comes to mind at the moment — but these are very specialized ( though profitable ) niches .
Most of the stuff that ordinary developers will want to do with GPGPU in the medium - term is more mundane and application - specific , like using the GPU to speed up some specific part of a common application in order to give a performance boost vs. the CPU alone .
In other words , these common apps do n't solve data - parallel , compute - intensive problems — rather , they have specific parts that need acceleration , and if there 's a capable GPU available then they can use OpenCL to hand off that part to it .
Note that Snow Leopard will come with an OpenCL implementation that works on both CPUs and GPUs .
Ars will have a review when it launches , so stay tuned .
BUENOS AIRES - Chile has been Latin America 's success story since the 1980's , boasting rapid economic growth , successful integration into the world economy , solid democratic institutions , an effective state bureaucracy , and low levels of corruption .
By most standards , the country is far better off than the rest of the region .
Not surprisingly , Chileans have kept the ruling Christian Democrat - Socialist coalition ( the Concertación ) in power for four consecutive terms since 1990 , when democracy was restored after 17 years of General Augusto Pinochet 's repressive military rule .
On December 13 , however , voters in Chile 's presidential election are likely to make the Concertación candidate sweat .
The Concertación is running Christian Democrat Eduardo Frei , the son of a former president who was president himself from 1994 until 2000 .
His opponent is Sebastián Piñera , a tycoon , former senator , and presidential runner - up in 2006 who represents the main opposition forces - Piñera 's moderately conservative Renovación Nacional ( RN ) and the more rightist Union Democrata Independiente ( UDI ) .
So far , nothing new : the RN and the UDI - which differ mainly in their attitude towards the military government from which they emerged ( the RN being the more self - critical ) - have been the main challengers in all the previous elections .
But change is coming , in the form of a 36 - year - old maverick with no traditional - party backing .
Marco Enríquez - Ominami , with about 20 % support in recent polls , is remarkably close to Frei ( around 26 % ) , and not terribly far from Piñera ( roughly 38 % ) .
The young candidate 's unexpected popular support is rooted within the ruling coalition : his adoptive father is a prominent Socialist senator ( his biological father , a leader of the revolutionary left in the 1970's , was killed by Pinochet 's political police ) .
Marco himself was elected deputy on the Socialist ticket , but he defected when the party denied him the chance to contest Frei 's nomination in a primary .
With this unique mix of insider knowledge and outsider status , and a freshness that both main candidates lack , Enríquez - Ominami has gone farther than most observers predicted .
Piñera 's lead and the emergence of Enríquez - Ominami are probably expressions of the same phenomenon : fatigue with - and within - the Concertación .
Despite its many successes since 1990 , and the high popularity of the current president ( Socialist Michelle Bachelet , Chile 's first female chief executive ) , time is taking a toll .
In recent years , several groups have split from the incumbent parties .
Many voters are following suit , drawn mainly to Enríquez - Ominami .
Frei's lackluster numbers reflect his own weaknesses ( he is notoriously uncharismatic and was the least popular of the four Concertación presidents ) , as well as the inevitable stress that two decades of uninterrupted rule has placed on the ruling coalition .
As things stand now , the right is likely to win the first round , but with less than 50 % .
Even a comfortable Piñera victory could be reversed on the January 17th run-off , as Frei and Enríquez - Ominami are essentially splitting the center - left vote .
Enríquez - Ominami has the popularity and momentum to displace Frei from the run-off , but he may have a harder time defeating Piñera .
The two most likely scenarios , then , are government continuity or predictable change ( the right has been expected to capture the presidency for years ) .
But a third scenario - less predictable change following a victory by Enríquez - Ominami - should not be ruled out , as campaign advertisements will appear in the media only starting November 13 .
In terms of Chile 's major policies , however , continuity is almost certain to prevail , even if Enríquez - Ominami wins .
The center - left coalition that defeated Pinochet ( in a 1988 plebiscite and his presidential candidate in the 1989 election ) has been wise enough to keep , and in some cases deepen , the sound free - market policies inherited from the military government .
Chile boasts orthodox fiscal and monetary management , a very open economy , and a dynamic private sector .
It was also the first country in the world to adopt a fully private pension system , a policy experiment carried out by one of Pinochet 's technocrats ( who happened to be Piñera 's brother , José ) and largely kept in place since then .
These policies are popular with voters , and they are protected by powerful actors ( for example , the strong export - oriented business sector ) and by trade agreements with almost all the world 's major economies and regional blocs .
Unlike many Latin American countries , in which populist backlashes have followed the liberalizing reforms of the 1990's , the main challenger in Chile is an even more pro-market coalition .
Beyond the economy , there are , of course , many areas of disagreement .
The Concertación has dealt prudently with the political legacies of the dictatorship , gradually rescinding the self - serving rules that Pinochet created to protect himself , the military , and the right , and making some progress in prosecuting human rights violators .
But many are not happy : the far left - not very strong these days but with an important political tradition - wants more and faster progress on prosecutions , while the recalcitrant right insists on treating Pinochet ( who died in 2006 ) as a national hero .
Moral , ethnic , and environmental issues follow similar ideological lines .
And yet the range of the policy debate is much narrower , and the tone more amiable , than is the case in Chile 's more polarized neighbors , such as Argentina , Bolivia , and Venezuela .
In either of the most probable scenarios , continuity or prudent change , or even if the " outsider " candidate wins , Chile will in all likelihood remain a beacon of democratic stability , economic dynamism , and international engagement in a region too often characterized by political and economic turbulence .
Aussie Rate Hike Just The Beginning
October 6 , 2009
The 25 - basis point hike in the Reserve Bank ’s cash rate to 3.25 % is first increase since March 2008 and ends a streak of six cuts between September 2008 and April 2009 totaling 425 basis points .
That very sharp rate decline to a 49 - year low braced for what officials expected to be “ a serious economic contraction in Australia , ” according to a statement released by monetary officials today .
The passing of such a risk has passed , justifying today ’s “ prudent ” step “ to begin gradually lessening the stimulus provided by monetary policy . ”
Thus , Australia joins the Bank of Israel as only the second central bank to tighten following the global financial crisis and the first Group of Twenty central bank to do so .
The statement notes that today ’s rate hike was made after the Board “ carefully considered ” the sharp appreciation of the Australian dollar , which will constrain imported inflation and growth in some tradable goods sectors .
Nonetheless , officials expected underlying inflation to bottom out at a higher level than assumed previously because of a higher economic growth profile .
The Bank ’s latest forecasts had penciled in GDP growth of 2.25 % next year and 3.75 % in 2011 , and today ’s statement characterized future growth as probably “ close to trend . ”
On the matter of economic growth , note is made that many governments are retaining expansionary macro-economic policy settings , that conditions in Australia have developed more strongly than expected , that confidence is recovering , that private investment in particular is positioned for revival , that housing and public infrastructure are perking up too , and that “ large firms have had good access to equity capital and access to debt markets appears to be improving . ”
Most of all , Australia is benefiting from brisk Chinese demand , which elevates commodity prices and is a source of direct bidding for Australian exports .
Now that the Reserve Bank has begun tightening while other central bank policy stances are likely to stay on hold for some time longer , the way would seem clear for a further climb of the Aussie dollar to and above 90 U.S. cents .
Today ’s response was exaggerated because despite strong expectations of a hike before yearend , most analysts seems to have been caught on the wrong side of the fence regarding today ’s action .
Traders were thus unprepared for today ’s move and its juxtaposition against rumors of OPEC plans to abandon dollar pricing over then next decade .

Rex Ryan has overcome a lot of hurdles en route to becoming the Jets head coach , but one of them is little known to the public .
Ryan recently revealed to newyorkjets.com that he ’s had to deal with dyslexia , a learning disability that makes it difficult for people to acquire and process language .
That has left Ryan with difficulty reading , spelling and writing .
REPORT : Divided On Plax
“ I ’ll tell my players anything because I ’m not ashamed that I have this , ” Ryan said .
“ It ’s something that I overcame .
By far I ’m not a perfect person and I do n’t have all the answers .
But if I can relay a story that ’s happened to me or a situation that ’s happened in my life that I think a player possibly can benefit from , I ’ll be more than happy to share it .
“ Still to this day , I ’m a horrible speller , ” said Ryan , who graduated and earned a masters from Eastern Kentucky , and has had significant success as a football coach and a defensive guru .
“ All my life I struggled , ” he said .
“ I read , but I probably do n’t read as fast as other people , even though I read all the time now .
I struggle with names sometimes , how to pronounce names , or how to read names .
“ I remember skipping school when I was a kid all the time .
. . .
I was embarrassed .
How come I was struggling ?
I ’d get a spelling test and it was ridiculous .
I could n’t even get in the ballpark .
So that was really frustrating . ”
Ryan has difficulty retain information when in black and white , however , color helps .
To help himself , he color - codes everything .
Ryan said he ’s happy to spread the word about dyslexia in hopes that his dealings with it will help others who have it .
“ If you have dyslexia , you can still reach your goals , ” he said .
“ And understand , it ’ll be a negative , no question , it ’s a challenge .
But if you overcome it , you can do some great things , so do n’t let it get in your way .
“ It was never easy .
But it ’s funny because I had this weakness but I had other gifts .
That ’s probably why I ’m sitting in this chair now . ”

Anyone with a TV has likely seen the Lunesta moth , fluttering from house to house , bringing sleep to restless insomniacs ; or observed that rooster , strutting dark streets alone after being banished from bedrooms by Ambien CR ; or watched Abe Lincoln beckon a guy back to Dreamland , thanks to Rozerem .
Indeed , ads for anti-insomnia drugs are ubiquitous .
Makers of those three medications alone spent just shy of $ 300 million last year to publicize their products on TV , radio , the Web , and in print , according to TNS Media Intelligence , a company that tracks advertising .
What consumers do n't see marketed is an insomnia treatment that evidence suggests is equally if not more effective : cognitive behavioral therapy , or CBT .
Cognitive behavioral therapy has been applied to everything from depression and anxiety to chronic pain and addiction .
But a brand specifically fashioned for insomniacs has been gaining ground .
Seventy to 80 percent of people with chronic insomnia — persistent difficulty in falling or staying asleep — seem to benefit significantly from a treatment course of CBT , experts say .
And the gains have been shown to last for years after sessions end .
Prescription sleep aids can help summon sleep in the short term , but once people stop taking the medication , they tend to backslide .
Medication " is more like a Band - Aid , " says Charles Morin , a professor of psychology who directs the sleep research center at Laval University in Quebec .
" It does n't address those factors that perpetuate and maintain insomnia . "
CBT , he says , does .
That 's because for many people , chronic insomnia is at least in part a problem of distorted thoughts and behaviors that impinge on sleep .
CBT aims to fix those .
The cognitive component of the therapy helps alter unhelpful attitudes and beliefs thatcause anxiety , arouse the body , and make sleep difficult .
Consider someone who tends to catastrophize :
If I sleep poorly tonight , I wo n't be able to perform at work ;
If I can't perform at work , my boss will notice ;
If my boss notices , I wo n't get that raise ;
If I do n't get that raise , I 'll lose my home .
A therapist might help him search his history for times when he slept poorly but still did well the next day and vice versa , then help him restructure his thoughts , á la :
If I do n't sleep well tonight , I wo n't be at my best tomorrow , but I 'll still make it through and perform adequately .
A therapist might also help dispel myths about sleep , such as the belief that everyone needs eight hours for optimal health and functioning — not true — or help people schedule problem - solving times during the day , so as not to bring worries to bed .
The behavioral piece helps reset the sleep - wake cycle , which can get thrown off by reactions to insomnia .
Some of this process is straightforward : avoiding daytime naps , rising at the same time daily , getting out of bed when sleep is n't happening rather than agonizing with eyes glued to the clock .
Some steps are more complex .
" Sleep restriction , " for example , is a technique that limits time in bed to help people boost their " sleep efficiency , " the percentage of time in bed that they spend asleep .
For example , an insomniac who averages six hours of slumber each night — regardless of whether an additional three are spent trying to doze off — would start by restricting time in bed to no more than six and a half hours .
Presumably , he 'd clock less sleep than that , be tired , and have less trouble sleeping the next night .
CBT is no quick fix : People typically need between two and eight sessions to reap benefits , and it takes effort to implement a therapist 's advice .
But " there 's general consensus now , " says Gregg Jacobs , an insomnia specialist at the University of Massachusetts Medical School 's Sleep Disorders Center , that CBT " is the preferred and recommended first - line treatment " for chronic insomnia .
It empowers patients to regain control over their sleep , and once habits are changed , they become a way of life , he says .
There 's just one big problem :
Not everyone has access to CBT , given a severe shortage of practitioners trained to offer CBT for insomnia , experts say .
Only about 130 people in the United States have so far been certified by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine ( AASM ) in behavioral sleep medicine .
While they 're not the only ones equipped to offer CBT for insomnia — about 1,800 AASM accredited sleep centers in the country either offer CBT for insomnia or should be able to direct sufferers to someone who does — that small cadre of specialists speaks to the shortfall .
" The dissemination of this treatment remains a challenge for us , " says Jack Edinger , a clinical professor in Duke University 's psychiatry and behavioral sciences department .
It 's especially difficult , he says , for people in rural areas to find practitioners trained in CBT for insomnia .
That 's where the Internet comes in .
Data from two recent small studies — one described in the Archives of General Psychiatry , another in the journal Sleep — suggest that interactive Web - based programs , based on the components of face - to - face CBT therapy , can help people improve their sleep .
The lead authors of both studies say they plan to make their programs commercially available in the future .
Jacobs already runs a program called Conquering Insomnia , which " replicates " a CBT treatment program he developed and tested in roughly 10,000 patients ( www.cbtforinsomnia.com, $ 24.95 ) .
HealthMedia 's Overcoming Insomnia is available at no cost through many employers and health plans such as Kaiser Permanente and Aetna , according to a company spokesperson , and it's also being tested for sale to consumers ( healthcoach.myselfhelp.com , $ 19.95 ) .
Internet - based treatments " have tremendous capacity for reaching a very large number of patients , " says Michael Sateia , a professor of psychiatry and chief of sleep medicine at Dartmouth - Hitchcock Medical Center .
But Sateia , who was n't involved in the latest studies , cautions that more research is needed to evaluate the treatments ' effectiveness .
Same goes for the CBT - for - insomnia self - help books that are multiplying , experts say .
It 's not clear which insomniacs would benefit most from self - help measures and which need face - time with a therapist ; insomnia can be the byproduct of a physical or mental health problem , experts say .
" We have to be careful , " says Morin .
" Not everyone will do well with reading a book or [ using ] the Internet . "
I was recently contacted by a person called Graeme Cobbett .
In his email he told me he got his Windows license refunded and donated that money to Linux Mint .
Of course , as you can imagine , he felt pretty happy about it and he wanted to let people know how he did it .
So here ’s his article on the topic .
Good reading everyone !
Hello , my name is Graeme Cobbett .
Today , I donated $ 112 to Linux Mint .
But I did n’t fund this myself : Microsoft gave me the money .
Here ’s how I did it .
This is the story of how I bought a new notebook PC , replaced Windows with Linux and got a refund for the operating system I did n’t want .
Not many people do that last bit about getting a refund , but perhaps you can too , if you have a calm attitude and persevere then it can be straightforward .
1. Choose your new computer .
Take a look at the vast array of new PCs on the market .
Does the one you like come without Microsoft Windows ?
Unless it ’s a netbook , probably not .
Even if you do strike lucky , chances are it costs the same ( or even more in some cases ) than the equivalent with Windows .
So you are probably kinda fixed with buying a copy of Windows you do n’t want .
2 . Do n’t switch on your new computer yet !
You can only reject your software license if you do not use it .
You ’ll need to use another computer to do step 2 :
3. Download Linux .
This one ’s pretty easy .
First , you choose what kind of Linux you want .
I got Linux Mint because , being based on Ubuntu , it has a huge support base so you can easily Google for help .
But unlike Ubuntu , it comes ready to play DVDs , music files and Flash files with no tinkering .
If you use Windows to download your replacement operating system , the only tricky bit is that you have to use a special utility like Isorecorder to burn the file .
( http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm).
4. Test Linux to make sure it works
You can do this on your new computer without starting Windows : just put your newly - burned CD or USB stick into your computer before you switch on .
Not everything might work perfectly first time .
For example , on my Dell Studio 1555 , the sound did n’t work .
So I just googled “ Dell Studio 1555 Ubuntu Sound ” and found a step - by - step fix which fixed things straight away .
5 . Reject your software license
Have you ever read the Microsoft Windows End User License Agreement ?
It ’s pretty scary what you commit yourself to .
If you buy Dell , then as soon as you start Windows then you agree to a second set of scary software terms .
So reject them .
Email is probably the best way : unlike support phone lines it ’s free , you can make your case concisely , and if your vendor makes an offer you have proof right in your inbox , so they ca n’t go back on their word .
Do n’t delay – for example , Dell like you to do this within 7 days .
Here ’s what I wrote :
“ I do not agree to the terms of the Dell Software Licensing Agreement or the Microsoft Windows End User License Agreement .
“ I confirm that I have not used any of the software , have not opened or broken the seal on any software packet and have deleted all preloaded or embedded software from my Dell .
“ 1 . How may I promptly return the disks and other software items to you ?
“ 2 . How will you refund the cost of the software ?
I note that Windows Vista Home Premium retails at £ 133.96 , Microsoft Works at £ 39.99 and Cyberlink PowerDVD at £ 39.99 today , which means a total refund of £ 213.94 is due .
“ best regards ”
6 . Argue the case
I was all fired up for this bit .
The article at http://www.linux.com/archive/articles/59381
covers your bases really well : I recommend looking there if your vendor tries to reject your request the first few times .
So , I was all ready for a pitched battle with Dell when they replied within 48 hours offering this :
“ The software Cd ’s can be returned to Dell .
“ However , the refund for Cyberlink PowerDVD cannot be arranged as this software is already preinstalled on the system .
“ The amount that would be refunded for Vista Home Premium is £ 57.82+vat
and for Microsoft Works is £ 3.86+vat ”
Brilliant !
With tax , that adds up to about £ 70 ( US $ 110 ) , enough for me to overlook their nonsense about the DVD software .
I made sure never to say “ I accept your offer ” , instead preferring “ thank you for your offer .
You may collect the CDs on [ date ] . ”
Then , if they screw me around later , I can take them to court for full retail .
7. Gently persevere
So then comes the interesting bit .
Dell arranged to collect the software from me but their collection agent did n’t show .
Why would they ?
That ’s going to cost them £ 70 ( $ 110 ) .
They had me over a barrel , asking me to wait at home for a whole extra day .
So I upped the “ firm ” factor with a message :
“ On 27th August 2009 , I wrote to you rejecting your software license terms .
You wrote back on 31st August saying I could have a refund if I returned the software CDs .
“ You offered to collect the CDs on 11th September .
I lost a day ’s work waiting at home for you to collect the CDs but you did not collect them .
You have acknowledged this but not offered me an explanation .
“ You now say I may not have a refund unless we arrange for you to collect the software CDs another time .
I cannot afford to take another day off work , so I offered to post them to you .
You declined my offer .
“ I would like to give you another chance to make amends .
Please grant me a refund now .
If you are unable to do this , please send me a copy of Dell ’s formal complaints procedure so that I may raise my complaint at the appropriate level . ”
Dell knows that if I refuse a reasonable request by them then a small claims court will throw out any legal claim I make .
So I played nice until they realised they would have to let me use regular post to send the CDs .
So eventually I got my refund .
It took me 12 email exchanges in total , and Dell probably did n’t get a refund from Microsoft for the license .
But I suspect that every time someone secures a license refund , it has a more than proportionate effect on the PC manufacturers ’ next round of negotiations with Microsoft , gently loosening their tight monopoly grip on the operating system market .
8. Donate your refund to Linux Mint
Because you ’re one of the good guys .
Or just because you get a nice squidgy feeling from the idea that your the money you got back from your unwanted Microsoft software is keeping free , open - source software ahead of the game .
Pat yourself on the back !
No national T.V. for the Red White and Blue during their crucial World Cup Qualifying in Honduras .
is reporting that the U.S. National Team 's vital World Cup qualifying tie against Honduras on the 10th will not be carried on national television and will be only be shown on 200 closed - circuit outlets nationwide .
After trying to sell the rights to the game to ESPN and Fox Soccer Channel Spanish company Mediapro , who bought the broadcast rights from the Honduran federation , struck a deal with Integrated Sports Media to show the game on closed circuit .
The full list of bars and other outlets where the game can be viewed has not yet been released but the report indicates that only 20 - 30 venues will be showing the match in English with the rest of the outlets carrying the Spanish language version .
The U.S. National Team could clinch a World Cup spot with a win over the Hondurans , and as always Goal.com will have full coverage .
Noah Davis will be at the match and doing live commentary for those who can't make it to one of closed - circuit outlets , as well as post match reactions from the players and coaches .

Impromptu は Andrew Sorensen 氏によって作成されたライブコーディング環境だ。言語としては
Scheme をベースとしており，それに映像や音楽を扱うためのライブラリ群と，リアルタイムにコードを記述し実行するためのエディット環境が統合されている。
実際に触ってみると，関数型言語とライブコーディングの親和性が，なかなか良いことが分かってくる。エディターの出来も良く，リアルタイムにコードを書きつつ実行するという作業をスムースに流れるようサポートしてくれる。
上のビデオでは， Impromptu のサンプルプログラムを参考にしつつ，簡単なアルゴリズム作曲のコードを組んでみた。ちなみに，ビデオ中に登場する " my: play " 等の関数は，作業を簡略化するためにあらかじめ用意しておいた関数なので悪しからず。
いくつかのデメリットもあるものの（最大の弱点は
Mac OS 版しか存在しないということかもしれない），ライブコーディングやアルゴリズム作曲のための実験環境，または関数型言語を学ぶための題材として，強く勧められるものだと思う。
A Feilding grandmother who lashed out at police with her legs , fists and backside was unable to convince a judge of her innocence at the Feilding District Court .
Having pleaded not guilty to eight charges of theft , obstruction , assault and threatening to kill , Joanne Bowler faced up to Judge Gregory Ross at a defended hearing yesterday .
Police prosector Sergeant Chris Whitmore said 52 - year - old Bowler was charged with obstructing police when she attempted to interfere with the arrest of her 28 - year - old daughter , Faith Bowler , at Feilding 's KFC restaurant on April 16 .
When Senior Constable Grant Lawton attempted to stop her , she punched him in the chest .
He arrested Joanne Bowler and took her to the Feilding police station but not before she threatened to kill him .
While in the cells , female police officers strip searched Bowler .
After stripping down and bending over , Bowler pushed her naked backside into Detective Felicity Mansell legs several times and told her to " take a good look " .
Shortly after this , Ms Mansell became engaged in a scuffle with Bowler which prompted constables Glenn Ryan and Scott Banner to intervene .
Mr Ryan was forced to pin Bowler 's legs and then punched her thighs to contain her .
In the melee , Bowler landed a kick to Mr Ryan 's upper leg narrowly missing his groin .
Bowler received severe bruising in the fight .
Three of the charges related to the theft of jewellery , photos and ornaments from three Feilding stores about midday on April 16 .
Mr Whitmore said Bowler , aided by daughter Faith , stuffed jewellery into her clothes when she entered Precioso .
This was corroborated by store assistant Sandra Osbourn , who said she felt intimidated by Bowler .
Bowler 's defence counsel Richard Bedford argued that Osbourn would have been unable to see Bowler commit the theft , as Faith was standing between them .
Bowler was also accused of stealing ornaments from Turners Gifts and Luggage and a bag of photos from I.B Mandahl Limited Photography .
Photo technician Tracey Neilson said she saw Bowler walk out the store with the bag , while fellow employee , Caroline James , saw the bag in the back seat of Bowler 's ute .
Mr Bedford said the bag could have been one Bowler had been given by the store earlier in the year .
Police recovered several stolen items from Bowler 's ute .
When Bowler took the stand , she denied taking anything from the shops .
Bowler , whose son Jordan was killed in a car crash earlier this year , said she only got involved in the KFC incident when she saw a police officer hit her daughter with a baton .
No evidence was presented to support this accusation .
Judge Ross said he rejected Bowler 's denials , and found her guilty on all but one of the charges .
He dismissed the theft charge at Turners Gift and Luggage because of a lack of evidence .
Sentencing is on September 22 .
A few quick questions .
1 . Are these new paintings , painted by Damien Hirst himself , any good ?
No , not at all , they are not worth looking at .
2 . So why are you writing about them at such length ?
Because he is very famous .
3 . And why has the Wallace Collection decided to exhibit them ?
Because he is very famous .
4 . And why did Damien Hirst even paint them in the first place ?
Because he is very famous .
Now let me put this at more length .
Damien
Hirst has painted some paintings , entirely by hand .
So far he has made his name with other kinds of art : with assemblages , mainly involving dead animals and pills , and paintings , painted by other people .
There have been the spot paintings , the spin paintings , paintings copied from photographs , all done by assistants .
But now he has risked his fame , with some paintings done by his own hand .
Anyone interested in Hirst 's art to date , anyone simply interested in Hirst as a very famous artist , will probably take an interest in this radical turn in his work .
What will they look like ?
There 's another thing .
Even now we 've learnt to accept that skills need n't matter , still that old question seems to linger over any artist , whatever methods they employ : can they actually paint ?

And if that was n't enough , there 's an extra attraction in where these paintings are being shown . ,
The Wallace Collection is a distinguished , old - fashioned venue , and chosen precisely as a traditionalist setting , to stress the way these new paintings have a place in the great tradition .
As the artist has said himself , he feels they are " deeply connected to the past . "
For the public , it 's intriguing .
If you were expecting some outrage from the master of Brit Art shock , expect again .
Here they are , then , looking like history .
In a long chamber , just off the Wallace 's main gallery of masterpieces , they hang on walls of sumptuous silk , and held in heavy old - master frames .
There are 25 pictures , including two triptychs .
Their collective title is No Love Lost , Blue Paintings .
And they do n't look back that far .
As you 'd expect , they are most reminiscent of paintings by Hirst 's hero , Francis Bacon .
You see it at once .
They take their effects , not from Bacon 's virtuoso exploding flesh images , but from the dourer Bacons of the 1950s .
There 's little colour .
Blue -ish whites glimmer out of blue - ish darkness .
As in Bacon , but more so , the figures are contained within frameworks of straight white lines .
The figurative matter consists ( mainly ) of Hirsty things – skulls , skeleton , a shark 's open maw , ashtrays , cigarette packets , flayed bodies , also lizards , thickets of wood .
There are grid patterns of white dots .
Like Bacons , they 're pretty big .
Their themes come in repetitive sequences .
There 's a series of very similar paintings of flayed bodies seen in a thicket , another series of skulls and ashstrays .
The subjects may sound harsh , but the painting of them is neither violent nor graceful , simply unassertive and unconfident , caution suggesting uncertainty .
There 's not a dash of virtuosity .
There 's an attempt at blurry , glowy etherealness .
There 's one picture of a vase of flowers with butterflies flying out of it in all directions , and some of the butterflies are quite neatly painted .
But come now .
This is ridiculous .
To talk in this considered way is to pretend that the paintings can be taken seriously .
So let 's be clear .
Many kinds of paintings get reviewed on these pages , and some of them ( in my judicious way ) I say are good , and some bad .
But in a way they 're all quite good , or they would n't be getting reviewed here in the first place .
These Hirst paintings are way outside that range .
They 're thoroughly derivative .
Their handling is weak .
They 're extremely boring .
I 'm not saying that he 's absolutely hopeless .
But I 'm not saying he 's any good either .
There are many degrees of painting .
There are many painters in evening classes much worse than Hirst .
On the other hand , you 'd find quite a few who were better , too .
To try to be accurate : Hirst , as a painter , is at about the level of a not - very - promising , first - year art student .
He is in his mid-forties .
There are dozens of youngsters who turn up at our art schools each year , doing this turgid teen - angst stuff .
And many of them are deluded enough , in their innocence , to think that their work is " deeply connected to the past . "
Their teachers have to scold and embarrass them out of these bad habits .
These kids may come to something .
At that point you can't really be sure .
But you can be sure that the Wallace Collection , in its kindness , would n't offer them a gallery to display their work .
And I too , in my kindness , would n't write about this present show , if it was n't for the level of public interest .
As for what Damien Hirst thinks he 's doing , it 's not my business , but anyone may wonder .
Yearning to be among the masters , and blinded by self - belief ?
Maybe .
And I could imagine another famous artist , who had made their name in assemblage , and who decided to try their hand at painting – but when it turned out like this , realised it simply would n't do , and sighed , and put it away , their fame not having warped their judgement .
And I could imagine another famous artist who did a similar thing , but who was n't quite sure , and realised that their fame was likely distort both their judgement and the public's .
So they submitted one of their new paintings , under a pseudonym , to the biennial John Moores Painting Prize competition , to see what would happen .
Hirst could have done the same .
Well , the artist can make a fool of himself , and it does n't matter .
I 'm sure the pictures will sell for a packet anyway , and if the critics are rude – I jolly well hope they are – the buyers need only be reminded of Van Gogh , rejected by all in his time , now seen as great .
( Ignore the slight circularity of this argument . )
No , it 's our poor little art world that I feel sorry for .
We just look so bloody stupid .
I mean , here is the director of the Wallace Collection – no names , no pack - drill – and what she says is :
Hirst 's paintings are " very classical in nature " and " his ethereal other - worldly treatment of the memento mori subject evokes centuries of great art ... a comparison can be made to the Wallace Collection 's great Poussin , A Dance to the Music of Time . "
Actually , the Wallace thinks so highly of its great Poussin that currently it exhibits it with a statuette plonked directly in front of it , so you can't see it properly .
Never mind .
You can see those Hirst paintings clearly enough , and then imagine what could have moved the mind of this director .
Was she dazzled by stardom ?
Can she really not see anything ?
We 're all blinded , I suppose , somehow .
So many things obscure a pure attention to good art .
The spectacle of blazing fame and self - delusion , the joy of people talking utter rubbish , and writing rude reviews : the freak show goes on .
At least today I have detained you long enough .
No Love Lost , Blue Paintings , Wallace Collection , London W1 ( 020-7563 9500 ) to 24 January
A rescued young Sunda pangolin takes his first tentative steps after being released back into the wild in Thailand , in a series of photographs snapped by staff from international conservation charity ZSL ( Zoological Society of London ) .
The Critically Endangered animal was being illegally kept in cramped conditions and constant darkness by a poacher , before being saved by ZSL staff and local park rangers .
Nicknamed Kosin – inspired by the Thai name for the god Indra , celebrated as a friend to humanity - by his rescuers , the puppy - sized youngster , estimated to be under a year old , weighed just 1kg and measured 67 - centimetres nose - to - tail .
Believed to have been snatched at night by poachers searching for pangolins to sell , experts think Kosin was kept alive as the meat and scales of live pangolins reach a higher price on the black market than those of dead animals .
Following his rescue , Kosin was given a thorough health check and despite his ordeal found to be in good condition .
After a short period of monitoring he was ready to be returned to the wild .
The team from ZSL transported him to a remote , safe place as far away from known poaching hotspots as possible and have been monitoring his release site ever since .
They are pleased to report that no poachers have been seen there since his release , giving Kosin the best possible chance of survival .
Dr Eileen Larney , ZSL Conservationist said : “ It was an extraordinary moment to watch Kosin being released back into the wild and then take his first steps back to the wild , but sadly his story is rare .
Our team was able to get to him in time , care for him and return him to the wild .
Thanks to the support of our donors and our incredible team he has been given a precious second chance , something many thousands of his species do not get .
“ A single pangolin is worth up to three months ’ wages for rural villagers in Thailand and is considered as valuable as a lottery win .
“ However , to combat the illegal pangolin trade we must stop poaching at the source .
It ’s a complex puzzle which requires global collaboration to both reduce demand and increase protection .
This story would have had a very different ending without the quick response of park rangers and ZSL ’s conservation partners .
Like all pangolins , Kosin faces an uncertain future but in moments like this we have hope . ”
All eight species of pangolin are now threatened with extinction due to widespread poaching .
Worldwide , pangolins are thought to be the most illegally trafficked mammal .
A seizure of pangolin scales in April 2019 weighed 14 tonnes , representing about 36,000 individual animals .
Estimates suggest more than 300 pangolins are poached from the wild every day .
ZSL is working in Thailand , Cameroon , Nepal , and the Philippines to protect pangolins and other Endangered species from illegal wildlife trade .
The team collaborates with communities to raise awareness , find alternative sources of income and create protected habitats where pangolins can thrive .
Drawing on a hugely successful track record of empowering communities across Asia and Africa .
– ZSL will continue to support communities in Nepal helping communities to plan and create environmentally sustainable ways to make a living and build the same opportunities for people in Kenya too – home to rhinos and elephants – through its UK Aid Match appeal - For People .
For Wildlife .
The future of wildlife and people are intertwined , and long - term success depends on solutions that work for everyone .
Through the UK Aid Match appeal ZSL is working alongside rural communities in Nepal and Kenya to set up sustainable ways to make a living , empowering them to feed their families , build independent futures and protect the wildlife they live alongside .
It 's being put about by their PR team that Kellogg 's are to individually laser etch each of their cornflakes with the company logo .
Is it too much to suggest that this might not be absolutely true ?
We 've all become used to ever more sophisticated and cynical advertising from the food industry as companies have cottoned on to the fact that tinkering with loved brands or unexpectedly removing favourite chocolate bars from the shelves has a desirable viral marketing effect which they can respond to by ' bringing back ' the product .
I blame Coca - Cola .
All this trickery means that we tend to view most of the releases and announcements that come from our PR friends with an even healthier dose of suspicion than even our former jaded paranoia .
So what to make of this jaunty little announcement from Kellogg 's yesterday ?
" Now you 'll always be able to tell your Corn Flakes from your corn fakes ! " with a twitpic of Kellogg 's flakes individually branded with the company logo ?
The story is , apparently , that the company has new laser technology ready to toast the tiny logo onto a zillion little flakes a day : " We 've established that it is possible to apply a logo or image onto food , now we need to see if there is a way of repeating it on large quantities of our cereal .
We 're looking into it , " the company 's food technologist , Helen Lyons is reported as saying .
When we phoned for confirmation we were told that she 's " on holiday at the moment " .
Hmm .
Shortly before throwing her Blackberry to the wind and hotfooting it out of Kellogg 's HQ to pack her holiday suitcase , Ms Lyons told the Metro , Mail and Telegraph that " giving our golden flakes of corn an official stamp of approval could be the answer " .
At last technology has made it possible to confound the makers of all those damned inferior flakes that would masquerade as Kellogg's .
( Top marks , by the way , to the Daily Mail reader who commented " I 'd like to see them do it to Rice Krispies " . )
Presumably the technology is n't that ready at all , given it has n't been used in the photograph above , which is , instead , ahem , digitally manipulated .
The phone call to Kellogg 's HQ this morning revealed little in the way of facts , and we 're now awaiting developments on the laser cornflake in the form of a response from whichever unlucky sod is standing in for Ms Lyons .
So .
Do you welcome this important development in food branding technology ?
Would you be reassured to see , as you tuck in of a morning , positive proof of the processing provenance of each and every flake ?
And is this really the best use of food technology ?
Like the blue star on a bottle of broon which tells you when it's at the right temperature , should cornflakes change colour when they 've gone soggy to warn you off ?
Instead of worrying about their branding , what should Kellogg 's be doing ?
The Israeli and Palestinian leaders are likely to hold their first meeting in the coming weeks , both sides indicated today , in what would be an important step toward a formal resumption of peace talks and a signal achievement for President Barack Obama .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The announcements came as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held four hours of talks with Obama 's Mideast envoy , George Mitchell , in London today .
Mitchell has been pressing Israel to halt construction of West Bank settlements as a confidence - building gesture toward the Palestinians .
In a joint statement released by the State Department in Washington later today , the two men said they had " made good progress " in talks , but did not elaborate .
" They agreed on the importance of restarting meaningful negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians and working toward a comprehensive peace , and that all sides need to take concrete steps toward peace , " the statement said .
Before the meeting , Netanyahu said he was making headway in defusing the unusually public disagreement with the Americans .
Netanyahu has said he wants a compromise that would allow Israel to continue with some settlement construction while at the same time restarting peace talks with the Palestinians .
" We are making headway .
My government has taken steps in both words and deeds to move forward , " he said .
In the past week , both Israel and the US have been signaling that an agreement could be within reach .
It is unclear what sort of compromise would be acceptable to the Americans or to the Palestinians .
Netanyahu and Mitchell are to meet in the United States next week .
Later today , Netanyahu traveled to Berlin where he met President Horst Koehler .
Obama , who has made Mideast diplomacy a top priority of his administration , has said he opposes all settlement construction .
The Palestinian president , Mahmoud Abbas , has staunchly refused to reopen peace talks until Netanyahu halts all settlement activity .
Years of on - again off - again negotiations broke down shortly before Netanyahu took office in March .
In a sign that Abbas was easing his position , Palestinian officials said their leader would likely meet Netanyahu at the UN General Assembly next month in New York .
The officials said American diplomats are eager to see the sides resume contact .

They said that , while Abbas is prepared to talk to Netanyahu , he would not reopen negotiations until Israel halts its settlement activities .
The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because nothing has been formally scheduled .
The Palestinians , and the international community , consider settlements to be obstacles to peace .
Some 300,000 Israelis now live in West Bank settlements , in addition to 180,000 Israelis living in Jewish neighborhoods in east Jerusalem .
The Palestinians claim both areas , captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war , as parts of a future independent state .
In recent days , Netanyahu has said he sees the spotlight on settlements as unfair and insisted the Mideast conflict is rooted in a deep Arab enmity toward Israel that predates them .
Israeli officials say Netanyahu expects the Arab world to make goodwill gestures to Israel in exchange for a settlement freeze .
The subject of settlements was also sure to be raised at his meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel tomorrow .
German government spokesman Klaus Vater said that Berlin backs a two - state solution and , pending that , advocates that " no further settlements be built in the occupied areas . "
A poll released today in Israel showed freezing settlements would be an unpopular move .
Almost two - thirds of those questioned told pollsters they opposed a freeze , even in return for moves by Arab countries toward normalization of ties with Israel .
Thirty - nine percent said they would support a freeze in return for Arab gestures .
Conducted by the Maagar Mohot polling company , the survey questioned 506 Jewish Israelis and had a margin of error of 4.5 percentage points .
The issue has come to overshadow Israel 's ties with the U.S and much of the international community since Netanyahu took power with a hardline government and Obama indicated that years of reluctant US tolerance for settlement construction had ended .
Netanyahu 's aides have been dropping optimistic hints in recent days , saying a compromise with the US is growing closer .
Mark Regev , Netanyahu 's spokesman , told reporters ahead of the Mitchell meeting , that the Israeli government hopes peace talks can be resumed " within several weeks . "
Israeli officials , like the Palestinians , have floated the idea of a meeting between Netanyahu and Abbas at the UN General Assembly .

TUSCALOOSA , Ala . -- Alabama coach Nick Saban said his kickers will not use tape to spot field goals and extra points from now on .
After reviewing video of South Carolina 's 20 - 6 loss to Alabama ( No. 2 BCS , No. 1 AP ) last week , Gamecocks coach Steve Spurrier pointed out Leigh Tiffin 's use of the white tape to spot his kicks and reported it to the Southeastern Conference .
The video showed Tiffin quickly putting the tape in his pocket after kicking , Spurrier said .
Spurrier said on Wednesday that he was told by the conference that what Tiffin did was against the rules .
Saban said he did n't know Tiffin was using the tape and said it is n't worth risking a 5 - yard penalty .
However , he says Tide coaches
have found Tiffin was n't alone in spotting the ball .
" We certainly do n't want our players to do anything that 's illegal , " Saban said .
" It is a 5 - yard penalty if you do anything to enhance the spot .
We 've done some research on it , and over half the teams in the league do something with it .
" They put grass there or a piece of mud or wherever it is , so the kicker knows where the ball 's going to be spotted .
We even saw verification where last year South Carolina 's kicker did it . "
Tiffin hit both extra points and field goals of 25 and 35 yards in Alabama 's win Saturday .
He also missed a 49 - yarder .
The senior is 9 - of - 11 on field goals and 21 - of - 23 on PATs this season .
Spurrier stopped short of accusing Alabama coaches of
intentionally breaking the rule .
" I heard that was not supposed to happen , you 're not supposed
to use anything like that , " Spurrier said .
" I guess Alabama
did n't know it was against the rules .
They said you 're not supposed
to use anything to spot the ball there .
I do n't know if they knew
it was illegal or legal but they dang sure did it last week .
It
looked funny watching the tape .
Maybe they thought it was
permissible .
Maybe the kicker did it on his own .
I do n't know . "
The NCAA football rulebook ( Rule 6 - 3 ; Article 10 ; subsection d ) says :
" Any device or material used to mark the spot of a scrimmage place kick or elevate the ball makes the kick illegal . "
The exception to the 5 - yard penalty is a kicking tee for kickoffs .
Otherwise , it is a live - ball foul and a 5 - yard penalty .
Information from The Associated Press was used in this report .
Australian police are investigating whether officers ran naked round an unmarked police van as they travelled to a stag party .
The incident was reported by a woman who saw two men get out of the van at traffic lights in Brisbane on Sunday afternoon .
When police checked the licence plate number , they realised it was a police vehicle , Australian media reported .
The officers were said to be " very remorseful " .
They were reportedly from the elite Special Emergency Response Team , used in situations involving explosives and hostage negotiation .
Commissioner Bob Atkinson said : " There is no excuse for this . "
Queensland Police Union president Ian Leavers said that due to the nature of their jobs , the officers were usually on call 24 hours a day and did not usually drink alcohol .
" Their actions on Sunday are completely out of character and they are very remorseful , " he was quoted by the Brisbane Times as saying .
Queensland Police Service ethical standards command is investigating the report .
The officers could be charged with wilful exposure and public nuisance , and face disciplinary action ranging from a caution to being fired .

Advertisement Japan's new unmanned space freighter has been safely berthed to the International Space Station ( ISS ) .
The H - II Transfer Vehicle ( HTV ) moved itself to within 10 m of the ISS to allow itself to be grabbed by the platform 's robotic arm .
The arm , operated from inside the station by astronauts Nicole Stott and Bob Thirsk , then moved the freighter to a docking port to lock it in place .
The HTV is carrying about 4.5 tonnes of supplies for the station .
These stores include food , water , clothing , laptops and other equipment .
The new vessel is one of Japan 's major contributions to the orbiting project and is part of the barter agreement it has with the other station partners to pay its way .
The HTVs that follow in the coming years will play a critical role in servicing the ISS after the US space shuttles are retired .
This initial freighter was launched from the Tanegashima base in the south of Japan last week .
It is the first spacecraft to visit the ISS which does not drive itself all the way to berthing .
Rather , it simply parks up under the bow of the station to allow the platform 's Canadarm2 to manage the final stage of attachment .
The HTV was grabbed by the robotic lever at 1947 GMT , and was docked to the Earth - facing port of the ISS Harmony node just over two - and - a - half - hours later at 2226 GMT .
Length : 9.8 m ; Diameter : 4.4 m ; Vehicle Mass : 10.5t ; Max cargo :
6t Pressurised cargo : Food , clothing , water , laptops , science equipment , etc External cargo : Equipment to study Earth 's oceans and the atmosphere First unmanned vehicle to deliver both pressurised and unpressurised cargo
In addition to the cargo ( 3.6t ) carried in the HTV 's pressurised compartment ( accessed from inside the ISS ) , the ship has important cargo ( 900 kg ) mounted on a pallet in an unpressurised compartment .
These exterior supplies include two new Earth - observation experiments for the exposed " terrace " of instruments that sits outside Japan 's Kibo science module .
In the next few days , astronauts will again use the station arm to remove the pallet before handing it across to the Kibo arm , which will then position the new experiments .
As the astronauts deplete the HTV 's pressurised supplies , they will fill the empty storage racks with rubbish .
In six weeks ' time , the freighter will be detached from the ISS before taking itself and the waste into a controlled burn - up over the Pacific Ocean .
When the US shuttles retire at the end of next year or the beginning of 2011 , the ISS project will become dependent on five robotic freighters for its logistics : • The Russian Progress and European ATV have already demonstrated their flight capability .
Four more ATVs have been booked to fly to the station , one a year starting in 2010 .
•
After the first HTV mission , Japan plans a further six flights through to 2015 .
•
Two commercial US suppliers , SpaceX and Orbital Sciences , are in the process of developing their Dragon and Cygnus supply ships .
The first of these is scheduled to deliver supplies to the ISS no earlier than the end of 2010 .
HTV and Dragon are particularly important because of their ability to deliver larger items in their unpressurised compartments that would not normally fit through the docking port of a pressurised compartment .

A researcher holds a sample of prototyped solar cells .
The inset is an electron micrograph of the nanostructures .
( PhysOrg.com ) -- A UT Dallas researcher envisions a time soon when plastic sheets of solar cells are inexpensively stamped out in factories and then affixed to cell phones , laptops and other power - hungry mobile devices .
And a new $ 330,000 grant from the National Science Foundation should help him come closer to realizing that vision .
Many researchers are investigating the development of flexible solar cells in hopes of improving efficiency and lowering manufacturing costs , however Walter Hu’s novel approach would use nanoimprint lithography to produce precisely nanostructured devices rather than using chemical methods of manufacturing .
Nanoimprinting is an emerging technology that ’s been used to produce various electronic and optical devices by imprinting the pattern from a mold onto a surface .
But Dr. Hu ’s team is exploring how the thermal imprinting can not only impart a pattern to the solar cell material but also change properties of the material in ways that maximize light absorption , increasing the efficiency of the resulting cells well beyond what anyone has done to date with these so - called organic solar cells .
That requires exploring all of the interrelated properties of the solar cell material ’s plastic polymer surface ( such as crystallinity , molecular orientation , stability and thermal dynamics ) and their correlation with geometry , imprint conditions , surface effects and the quantum efficiency of the resulting solar cells .
“ Scientifically , we would like to understand - materials - wise , engineering - wise - how we can solve the problem of engineering materials at the nanoscale to improve solar cell performance , ” said Dr. Hu , an assistant professor of electrical engineering in the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science at UT Dallas .
Understanding these basic questions is important to developing new methods to improve the power conversion efficiency as well as the stability of next - generation solar cells , he added .
His team is collaborating with J.C. Hummelen at the University of Groningen , Netherlands , who is internationally recognized for the creation of PCBM , a popular nanomaterial for organic solar cells .
Dr. Hummelen will customize those materialls to fit the nanoimprint process .
Dr. Hu ’s group also works closely with Anvar Zakhidov , a renowned expert in solar cells at the UT Dallas Nanotech Institute , to study various material systems and device architectures .
Dr. Hu ’s team is also addressing energy payback , which is the time needed once a solar - cell system is operable to both recover the amount of energy used to manufacture it and offset carbon emissions from that manufacturing .
Conventional silicon - based solar cells are manufacturing - intensive .
The energy payback for these systems is two to four years .
The organic solar cells his team is developing would have an energy payback that can be measured in a few months .
“ The fundamental science of this project is very interesting to us , ” he said .
“ Plus it ’s a great project for training graduate students to do advanced engineering research . ”

Ofcom 's latest update on power - line networking is " dismissive " , " inaccurate " and " fails to respond to complaints " according to the Radio Society , who just wo n't let the matter lie .
Ofcom recently updated its position on power - line networking , an update that focuses on how much the regulator is doing to address a tiny problem experienced by only a few people .
However , that approach has riled the Radio Society of Great Britain , whose own complaint about the matter has been roundly ignored by the regulator .
The issue is interference generated by power - line networking kit , specifically Comtrend boxes supplied as part of BT 's Vision service .
Comtrend and Ofcom reckon the kit has passed the appropriate EU certifications , whereas the Radio Society contends that the Comtrend boxes only passed a draft version of one specification and fail to conform to another entirely .
This would theoretically mean they cannot legally be supplied in the UK - regardless of any generated interference .
It 's certainly true that the problem does n’t affect a lot of people :
Ofcom reckons it 's only received 143 complaints - all of which came from radio amateurs - of which 104 have been resolved .
Ofcom 's statement also rather snootily observes that other users in the same band , such as the MOD and long range oceanic communications , have n't complained at all .
That could be down to the lack of military and maritime activity that takes place near the houses of BT Vision customers , or perhaps because Ham Radio operators work at much lower tolerances than most radio users .
Whatever the reason , the clear inference from Ofcom is that the Ham Radio crowd likes making trouble .
The regulator does admit that power - line kit can generate interference , but claims that can be attributed to " the manner in which it is installed or operated " , and that it will be examining the issue further by working with the Radio Society .
The Radio Society is pleased to hear it will be involved , but would have appreciated some sort of notice .
The Society would also like a response to the letter it sent to Ofcom in July explaining , at some length ( pdf ) , exactly how the Comtrend boxes do n't even pretend to have passed proper certification and exceed legally - required emission levels .
The problem may not be affecting a lot of people , but if the equipment does n't conform to the required standards then it might seem that even one complaint should be enough to stop the it being sold .
If not , then it would seem pointless having the standards in the first place .
Or perhaps such standards only apply to small companies when their products impact lots of people , while large companies upsetting small groups of people can safely ignore the rules . ®
Best Small Business Loans and Merchant Cash Advances
Since 2001 , American Microloan , LLC ( AML ) has served as one of the country 's leading small business loan providers , making it possible for business owners to meet their small business finance goals through our affordable merchant cash advance program .
As one of the country 's leading small business lenders , providing cash advances and quick loans to merchants in the form of short - term working capital , we are changing the face of the small business lender .
We provide business owners with an affordable alternative to the traditional loans obtained through a commercial finance company .
The cash advance is our specialty at American Microloan , where we provide small business financing and unsecured term loans and small business loans via short - term working capital financing to Visa and MasterCard credit card merchant account holders at a reasonable rate .
Before AML , merchants who needed small business funding had no alternative to traditional bank loans except for outrageously expensive factoring - type short - term financing .
These " factoring " companies were thriving at the merchant 's expense because they had no real competition when it came to providing a traditional business loan or commercial loan .
Fast Cash , Quick Loans , Working Capital , Business Funding and More AML 's business model was engineered from the very beginning to provide financing to merchants at the lowest possible cost with no " fine print . "
We are the only financing company in the industry to disclose full financing information right on our web site .
Since our inception , we have been providing small business owners with an alternative to traditional bank financing , which is very difficult to obtain and out of reach for most merchants .
We understand that as a small business owner , traditional bank financing may simply not be an option .
As small business lenders , it is our goal to provide a small business loan for you at low rates and with easily obtainable small business finance based on our merchant cash advance program .

Note : Read about making animal - fat mayonnaise for a full recap on the science behind these recipes .
The jarred mayonnaise added to the food processor at the start makes it easier to create a more stable emulsion .
If you are an experienced mayonnaise - maker who has no problems with mayonnaise breaking on you , you may omit the jarred mayonnaise .
The mayonnaise can also be made in a bowl with a whisk .
This mayonnaise can be made with vegetable oil in place of the rendered animal fat - though flavor will suffer .
Walgreens recently settled a class action lawsuit which gives consumers the ability to claim up to $ 14.97 or a free flu shot without any proof of purchase or receipt necessary to submit their claim .
The class action lawsuit involves the Walgreens product Wal - Born .
Wal - Born ( also briefly sold as Wal - Borne ) is the Walgreens generic equivalent of the herbal cold remedy Airborne .
Consumers would take Wal - Born or Airborne in the belief it helps to help stave off colds .
The Wal - Born class action settlement is available now .
The class action ( Geis v. Walgreen Co. and Roper v. Walgreen Civil Action No. 2:07 - cv-4238-KSH - PS ) alleges that Walgreens made false claims regarding its Wal - Born products to the effect that they could treat or prevent the common cold .
This is very similar in nature to the Airborne Health Formula class action settlement of 2008 ( Wilson v. Airborne , Inc. et al .
Case No. EDC V07-770 VAP . )
You can read about the Airborne class action settlement at Top Class Actions .
Both class action lawsuits ended in the Plaintiffs settling and paying cash to claimants along with agreeing to change how they market their respective products and the effects of each .
Top Class Actions has initiated coverage of the Wal - Born settlement and breaks down for consumers exactly how to submit their claim .
Top Class
Actions details where to get the claim form , how to submit their claim and everything necessary for the consumer to easily claim up to $ 14.97 or a free flu shot .
Consumers claims must be submitted and postmarked by 9/7/2009 .
Claims will not be accepted after 9/7/2009 .
Scott Hardy , President of Top Class Actions , stated " In this recession there are thousands of consumers out there who could use the money from this class action settlement and others listed on our site .
In this case it could also help those without health insurance by getting them a free flu shot ( valued at $ 25 ) from Walgreens .
Children will be especially vulnerable to the Flu and Swine Flu ( H1N1 ) when the flu season starts in fall .
It 's great that protecting people is a priority for Walgreens and the attorneys involved with this class action settlement . "
Top Class Actions is based out of Phoenix , Arizona and have been posting class action lawsuit settlements since it launched in 2008 .
The website is completely free to access for consumers and breaks down class action lawsuit settlements in an easy to understand way .
Consumer Reports Consumerist and Karen Datko of MSN Money 's Smart Spending Blog have recognized Top Class Actions ( and the settlements posted ) multiple times , which is how many have stumbled across it .
On Top Class Actions you 'll see information about both Open ( open for claims ) and Closed ( claims no longer accepted ) settlements .
In addition consumers can submit complaints about products , services or anything else they want reviewed by an attorney for free so they can possibly start their own lawsuit .

PUERTO AYORA , Galapagos Islands -
The mounds of reeking garbage on the edge of this settlement 600 miles off Ecuador 's Pacific coast are proof that one species is thriving on the fragile archipelago whose unique wildlife inspired Darwin 's theory of evolution : man .
Tiny gray finches , descendants of birds that were crucial to his thesis , flutter around the dump , which serves a growing town of Ecuadoreans who have moved here to work in the islands ' thriving tourist industry .
The burgeoning human population of the Galapagos , which doubled to about 30,000 in the last decade , has unnerved environmentalists .
They point to evidence that the growth is already harming the ecosystem that allowed the islands ' more famous inhabitants - among them giant tortoises and boobies with brightly colored webbed feet - to evolve in isolation before mainlanders started colonizing the islands more than a century ago .
The growth has become enough of a threat to the environment that even the government , which still welcomes growth in the tourism industry , has begun taking the politically unpopular step of expelling hundreds of poor Ecuadoreans from a province that they feel is rightfully theirs .
By limiting the population , officials hope to preserve the natural wonders that bolster one of Ecuador 's most profitable sectors : tourism .
But the new measures are also feeding a backlash among unskilled migrants who say they feel they are being punished while the country continues to enjoy the tens of millions of dollars that tourists bring to Ecuador , one of South America 's poorest nations .
" We are being told that a tortoise for a rich foreigner to photograph is worth more than an Ecuadorean citizen , " said Maria Mariana de Reina Bustos , 54 , a migrant from Ambato in Ecuador 's central Andean valley , whose 22 - year - old daughter , Olga , was recently rounded up by the police near the slum of La Cascada and put on a plane to the mainland .
The first settlers came to the islands to live off the land ; working as fishermen and ranchers and farmers .
Now , most of those who make the short flight from Quito , the capital , or sneak on the islands in boats , are lured by different sorts of riches : the relatively high wages they can earn as taxi drivers and maids or workers in the islands ' growing bureaucracy .
For decades , the country 's leaders did little to prevent people from coming here , partly to build the tourist industry and , then , to ensure the government had a presence among the pioneers .
There seemed to be something of a natural limit on growth :
The country had put aside 97 percent of the archipelago as a park .
But as tourism and migration grew over the last decade , pressure began building within the archipelago 's scientific and environmental community and abroad for Ecuador to act on curbing the island 's population .
The United Nations put the Galapagos on its list of endangered heritage sites in 2007 .
Scientists here said people have already done significant damage , pointing to fuel spills , the poaching of giant tortoises and sharks and the introduction of invasive species - including rats , cattle and fire ants - that threaten animals endemic to the Galapagos .
Even seemingly benign human activities - like owning a pet - can have outsized consequences here .
" With people come cats , and with cats come threats to other animals found nowhere else in the world , " said Fernando Ortiz , coordinator of the Galapagos program for Conservation International .
Conflict is built into the rules that allowed Galapagos to be colonized in the first place , despite a lack of fresh water in the archipelago .
Technically , residency is granted to a limited number of people , including those born here and their spouses , people who arrived before 1998 , and those with temporary work permits .
Police , known in local slang as the " migra " - for their role in tracking down illegal migrants , set up impromptu checkpoints throughout the islands .
But the same government that pays the police 's wages also offers subsidies that started when Ecuador was interested in building the population .
One subsidy allows gasoline to cost about the same here as on the mainland .
Another allows residents to fly between the islands or to Quito for a fraction of what foreigners pay .
Loopholes also flourish .
For instance , a black market in residency thrives in which migrants marry established residents to obtain coveted identity cards .
The result : Puerto Ayora 's streets beckon with discotheques , food stands and souvenir shops .
On the outskirts , a billboard with the image of Leopoldo Bucheli , the pro-development mayor , celebrates a project called El Mirador that is clearing an area on the edge of town to build 1,000 new homes .
" All we want , like people anywhere on this planet , is a dignified existence , " said Yonny Mantuano , 36 , who bought a lot to build a home at El Mirador .
The government 's somewhat schizophrenic view of life here is echoed by the sentiments of the people .
Margarita Masaquiza , 45 , an Indian from Ecuador 's highlands who arrived here at the age of 14 , abhors the government 's expulsions .
" We built this province with our own hands , so , yes , it pains us to see our countrymen deported like animals , " said Masaquiza .
" After all , we are indigenous Ecuadoreans , how can we be illegal in our own country ? "
But when asked how she felt about the impact of new migrants on her four children and four grandchildren , Masaquiza adopted a different tone .
" We must preserve opportunities for our families , " she said .
Most people in Galapagos live on San Cristobal , an island where a penal colony functioned decades ago , and Santa Cruz , where Puerto Ayora is located .
Development is spreading to other parts of the archipelago , as well .
Isabela , the largest of the islands , offers a glimpse into the Galapagos frontier .
Despite its streets of sand , Puerto Villamil , Isabela 's main town , looks not unlike a Phoenix subdivision circa 2007 .
Laborers work feverishly on 200 new cinderblock homes on the town 's edge .
Only about 2,000 people live in the town , but it boasts one of the Galapagos ' highest rates of population growth , about 9 percent a year .
" I earn $ 1,200 a month here , while I could only earn $ 500 a month on the continent , " said Bolivar Buri , 26 , a construction worker born in Puerto Villamil who made a small fortune this year when he sold an empty lot for $ 8,000 that he bought six years ago for $ 600 .
But even in the island 's less spoiled areas , there is little doubt that this is not the land that Darwin left .
On the road from Puerto Villamil to the drizzle - shrouded crater of Sierra Negra volcano , subsistence hunters on horseback scan the forest for wild pigs , a species introduced by mariners over a century ago .
White cattle egrets , another introduced species , fly overhead .
One recent day , Manuel Lopez , a cowboy and migrant from the mainland who tends a herd under the volcano 's mist , emerged from a forest thick with guava trees .
He paused under the equatorial sun ; his gaze narrowed .
" If it is God 's will , I 'm on this island to stay , " said Lopez , 36 .
" We must be in Galapagos for a reason , " he said , prodding a visitor to reply .
" Yes or no ? "
SAN FRANCISCO — US soft drink giant PepsiCo has apologized for a free iPhone application crafted to help men seduce women and keep records of conquests but the program remained available on Tuesday .
Pepsi’s “ AMP Up Before You Score ” iPhone application categorizes women into 24 types and then uses the Apple smartphone ’s Internet capabilities to link users to information about them and what they like .

AMP is an energy drink made by PepsiCo .
“ Let ’s say you meet a girl who is way into being green and you need a vegan restaurant stat ; we ’ve got you covered , ” a voice - over maintained on Tuesday in an online Pepsi video about the AMP at YouTube .
“ If you are anticipating a successful night , the Before You Score app gives you up to the minute information , feeds , lines and much more to help you amp up and talk to 24 different types of ladies . ”
Types of women listed in the application include punk rocker , bookworm , aspiring actress , artist , and sorority girl .
A “ Keep a List ” feature in the program reportedly prompts users to add women ’s names and encounter details to a “ brag list ” if they “ get lucky . ”
People offended by the application shared their ire with PepsiCo , which fired off an apology on popular microblogging service Twitter .

“ Our app tried 2 show the humorous lengths guys go2 get women , ” the message read in shorthand typical of ‘ tweets ” which are capped at 140 characters .
“ We apologize if it ’s in bad taste and appreciate ur feedback . ”
The AMP app remained available at the App Store , according to a check Tuesday by AFP .

Online commentary ranged from amused to outrage .
“ It ’s just Pepsi trying to lighten things up in the world , ” a person maintained in a chat forum accompanying the AMP video at YouTube .

“ Whether this is a joke or not … this is not cool , ” countered another member of the online exchange .
. . . the U.S. today consumes about 63 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day - in energy BTU equivalency terms , that ’s 10.5 million barrels of oil per day , or about half of the amount of oil that the U.S. consumes each day .
Of that 63 bcf per day of natural gas consumption , we import about 1 bcf in the form of liquefied natural gas , or LNG , and we import about 8 bcf per day from Canada .
This means that we are about 98.5 % self - reliant on natural gas supply from North America and about 86 % self - reliant on natural gas supply from the U.S. Contrast that with oil , where we are only about 41 % North American self - reliant and only about 27 % self - reliant from U.S. sources .
There has been a considerable hype in the press about the value of the gas from these shales , and the ability that they provide to bring in an “ Age of Natural Gas ” .
Commenting on the situation last year , the CEO of Chesapeake noted :
Unfortunately I have had to miss the ASPO Meeting in Denver this week , and so cannot provide the daily reports that I have written in the past .
But I notice that at least one of the talks has already caught a significant amount of press , and that is the one by Arthur Berman on the gas production from shale deposits such as the Barnett , Haynesville and Marcellus .
This picture of a large supply of natural gas has been strengthened by the increase in production from a number of the gas shale fields , at the same time that the recession hit , and as a result there has been more gas available than needed , and the price has dropped considerably as a result .
This , in turn , has led to a considerable reduction in the number of rigs that have been drilling new wells .
Natural gas has been steadily increasing its share of electricity generation , rising to over 20 % of the market , on its way to 25 % .
Natural gas is favored because of its reduced carbon footprint over coal , and it has historically been used since it is somewhat easier to start and stop gas turbines than it is coal - fired power .
Thus natural gas is seen as a favored backup to the installation of wind farms , where the vagaries of the wind are backed by the ability to use natural gas when needed .
There are , however , considerable concerns about the ability of wells in the gas shale to produce to the targets that are being set up .
I first noted Arthur Berman ’s concern about this back in 2007 when I drew attention to a piece he had written in World Oil , where he noted the short life of most of the gas - producing wells ; the very high costs for the wells and technology required to create them and , as a result , that only 28 % of them return a reasonable profit .
( Unfortunately the article itself is now behind a paywall ) .
Since then I returned to the topic at Bit Tooth showing , among other data , the very high decline rate ( now 60 % ) of many of the gas wells in Texas ( where the Barnett shale is ) that Swindell has reported .
First year decline rates of Texas natural gas wells ( after Swindell )
There is further disquieting news that is now coming out of the Barnett field .
The Ft Worth Weekly has just reported that many of those who expected to make substantial amounts of bonus money from drilling companies using their leases have had the agreements withdrawn and lost their money .
In April 2008 , the Southeast Arlington Communities of Texas ( SEACTX ) negotiated a deal with XTO Energy that would bring in bonus money of $ 26,517 per acre and a royalty rate of 26.5 percent - among the highest in the Barnett Shale play .
When leaders of SEACTX , representing about 7,000 property owners with about 5,000 acres , did the math , they figured that more than $ 100 million in upfront bonuses would be coming into their community of mostly modest to middle - class neighborhoods .
. . . . . . . . .
Well , that was then and this is now , when natural gas prices have fallen to less than half what they were in early 2008 .
And as anyone who has been following the Barnett Shale saga knows , drilling companies pulled out of those deals and others in mid-October of last year .
Some property owners , whose bonus checks were processed prior to the cancellation , got paid .
Tolli Thomas , a spokeswoman for SWFA , estimated that 4,000 to 5,000 people in her area got the money promised to them - and the other 20,000 or so did not .
Prices for drilling these wells run on the order of $ 5 million apiece , and Chesapeake has , in the past , noted that it takes $ 4.00 / kcf to bring in enough money to cover those costs – with a good well .
( Note that this is the Henry Hub price , consumers should add about $ 3 to this to get the residential price ) .
Those numbers are considerably higher than the ones that Mr. Berman used with his calculation two years ago that only 28 % of the wells will be financially remunerative .
He recently ( April 2009 ) expressed similar concerns about the Haynesville wells – though his production decline numbers are stunningly higher – as much as 20 - 30 % in a month , for an annual decline rate of 80 - 90 % .
The costs that he cites are up at the $ 7.5 to $ 9.5 million range for the wells , with a net final cost that the producer has to pay in the region of $ 7.25 / kcf .
He therefore concludes that the breakeven point for wells in the Haynesville lies at a price of around $ 9 / kcf Henry Hub ; with a minimum reserve of some 2.5 Bcf .
He upgraded that opinion in June expressing a concern , that I echo , with the availability of natural gas from a variety of sources ( including the Rocky Mountain Express and increased LNG shipments ) which will make it difficult to sell gas from formations such as the Haynesville , at a profit .
In his most recent post on the subject some of the possible reasons for the rapid decline ( which fall a little along the same explanation as I gave on chalk collapse ) which are as follows :
An abnormally high - pressure gradient ( 0.7 - 0.9 psi/ft ) distinguishes the Haynesville from other shale plays .
It may also explain the extremely high decline rates , as pressure depletion transfers stress to the rock and allows proppant - filled and open fractures to compress , thereby reducing the effective reservoir permeability .
Unfortunately for the hopes of a new age for gas , in preparation for a meeting on the Haynesville production last week , he had calculated the numbers for some 67 wells in the Haynesville and was still coming up with decline rates of 25 % a month .
He also noted :
The average EUR in our study is 1.72 Bcf / well , compared to the 6.5 - 7.5 Bcf / well reported by many operators .
Only two wells of the 67 evaluated have an EUR greater than 6.0 Bcf .
At the same time , seven wells have already produced more than 2 Bcf and one has exceeded 4 Bcf.
Petrohawk has the best well performance with an average EUR of 3.4 Bcf / well ( 19 wells evaluated ) .
Chesapeake has the most wells on production ( 29 wells evaluated ) but we project an average EUR of only 1.2 Bcf / well .
It sounds as though I missed a really interesting and valuable talk – just have to wait for the DVD ’s to come out , I guess !!
I plan to reorder some of the technical talks on Sundays so that I can more fully explain his concern about the Haynesville shale .
Church school head sacked ageing teachers ' to replace them with busty young women '
Scandal : Reverend William
Brooks is accused of sacking ageing teachers in favour of younger ones with more buxom figures
As head of an elite church school , Reverend William Brooks was keen to keep students ' attention in class .
So he sacked ageing teachers in favour of younger ones with more buxom figures , investigators claim .
The clergyman bragged repeatedly of his plans to ' replace all the older women with young women with big boobs , ' according to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission .
Now the 58 - year - old head of the upper- crust St Mark 's Episcopal School in Fort Lauderdale , Florida , is facing demands to reinstate four fired teachers and pay their back - wages - or face legal action .
' You 're cute - and cute people go a long way in this school , ' he is alleged to have also told a summer camp director - who is male .
The four teachers fired from their posts at the $ 14,500 - a- year private school were aged between 59 and 63 .
Brooks had plans to get rid of more than 20 others and bring in more shapely replacements , the EEOC claims .
' His actions , far from a mere random incident , are perceived to have malice , motive , preparation and intent to discriminate against older individuals , ' the commission concluded .
Lawyers for the 49 - year - old school - which boasts of being ' a warm , family - oriented , caring place ' and a ' dynamic and happy school where children love learning for its own sake ' - say the sacked teachers ' claims are false .
' These dismissals were due to legitimate planned workforce reductions and / or documented performance issues , ' said school lawyer Suzanne Bogdan .
If you cast your minds back to the 02 wireless gig last year we had a ( very successful ) meet up .
In addition to everyone having a good time many of you were filmed for a documentary about fandom - well that documentary has been turned into a movie - Starsuckers - and will be shown for the first time at the London Film Festival .
I stayed in touch with one of the team ( dare I say we even become friends ) and at the moment we have n't made the final cut so it 's not looking good .
The excuse given is that " Morrissey is too much of a legitimate icon " which I guess is a compliment .
However I am willing to try and wrestle the footage of us from the cutting room floor but do n't want to post it on here unless everyone who was filmed is happy for me to stick it on you tube ?
No promises but he who dares - wins !

From now on , anyone who wants to make you worse off has a new catchphrase .
If a mugger demands your wallet and you refuse to give it to him , he 'll say " Have n't you heard ?
We 're all in this together . "
And as he takes it he 'll say : " See , we 've all got to make a sacrifice . "
It 's a shame how it works , because this shared responsibility only seems to apply during a recession .
While the banks were making billions , very few politicians were screaming " For God 's sake you idiots , share all those bonuses out .
Ca n't you see we 're all in this together , " which goes to show how complicated economics can be .
Luckily for the richest layer of society , we were n't in it together back then , so from 1997 to 2007 the wealthiest 1 per cent of the country could double its share of the wealth , while the poorest 10 per cent had their share cut in half .
Then came the banking crash , after which that top layer took a humble and radical decision to carry on exactly the same .

So in the last year , the average pay of directors of FTSE companies has risen by 10 per cent , to reach £ 791,000 .
The first question to these people must be what could n't they get with only £ 721,000 that they need the extra for ?
If a director was told his salary was staying the same , would he shout : " WHAT ?
How am I going to pay for the kids ' space programme ?
I 've already had a red reminder bill from Nasa , I 'll have to do some mini-cabbing in the evening or I 'll be having the bailiffs round . "
Others have softened the blow of recession in other ways .
For example the chief of P&O was awarded , along with his pay rise , £ 80,000 worth of tickets for top sporting events .
Imagine if a union leader called a press conference and said : " While the management have conceded tickets for semi-final day at Wimbledon , there has sadly been no progress on the issue of the Third Test at Trent Bridge , and so the strike is due to begin at midnight tonight . "
Or there 's Martin Sorrell , Group chief of WPP advertising , who in the last year laid off 7,200 staff and collected a £ 3 m salary .
But because we 're all in it together maybe he gave them a little jingle as he laid them off , singing " You wo n't be let back in with a Sorrell sacking , now you 're on – the dole . "
No one even attempts to justify these raises any more , although they ought to be told to try , so we could see them muttering : " Well , it 's imperative I earn more than last year , to compensate for all the suffering of knowing we 're all in together .
Yes , that 's it . "
Instead , George Osborne and Peter Mandelson tell us these amounts would make little difference to the overall debt of the country .
So they make do with an occasional call on the banking industry to " show restraint " .
In which case both parties will presumably change their stance towards the slightly smaller amounts claimed illegally by people on benefits , and commission adverts that go " Benefit cheats – we 're closing in .
And when we do , you 'll be asked to show restraint and responsibility in the amount that you fiddle in the future .
Thank you . "
The cry that we 're suddenly together has happened countless times , in every recession .
There was probably a Roman emperor who announced " Citizens of Rome .
Unfortunately it appears I have used up all the gold of the empire in having a temple built for me and my wives .
It 's not my fault because no one was regulating me , as I had the last regulator crucified .
So the most important thing is for all slaves to work themselves to a wretched death as quickly as possible , as we 're all very much in this together .
Cheers . "
And maybe worst of all , if Labour do try to oppose the absurdity of a pair of multi-millionaires insisting we 're all in it together , they 'll look even more ridiculous than the Tories themselves .
Because when Brown complains about scurrilous bankers he has to explain why he's spent the last 14 years addressing bankers ' galas with speeches that go " My lords , ladies and gentlemen .
What do you want – less tax ?
De-regulation ?
Women ?
You just say it , I 'll sort it . "
And Mandelson will struggle to present himself as an opponent of the wealthy , despite claiming " Labour is in my blood " .
Maybe he 'll say next " You know , whenever I 'm on a trillionaire 's yacht I always drink Brown Ale , because I am at heart a working man . "
So the only coherent line they could put would be to say " The Tories are vicious .
Whereas we are vicious but incompetent .
So you can rest assured that when we try to cut your income in half , you have every chance of getting away with it because we 'll leave all the paperwork on the bus .
Vote Labour . "
This , from Rep. Gregg Harper ( What ?
Who ?
There 's a Rep. Gregg Harper ? ) is an extraordinarily douchey thing to say :
The latest edition of Politico 's " Get To Know A Congressman " series features Rep. Gregg Harper ( R - MS ) .
In the interview , Harper was asked about the Congressional Sportsmen 's Caucus , which advocates for hunters and fisherman in Congress : POLITICO :
What in the world does the Congressional Sportsmen 's Caucus do ?
HARPER : We hunt liberal , tree - hugging Democrats , although it does seem like a waste of good ammunition .
Ironically , Sen. Ben Nelson ( D - NE ) , a co-chair of the caucus , has praised the group for being bipartisan .
" Unlike some of the other activities in Washington , Republicans and Democrats reach across the aisle and join hands to work together , not as Republican or Democrat , but as sportsmen and women , " he wrote .
Yes , it 's painfully obvious that Harper is a dickbag and all .
But what does it say about Sen. Ben Nelson as a judge of character ?
I guess you 'd have to give him the benefit of the doubt , at least for a while .
He probably has no idea who Harper is , so there 's really now way of knowing that he 's going to turn out to be one of those gun-as - substitute - for - johnson types .
Hope Nelson speaks up and has something to say about this .
Or at least privately thinks to himself , " Maybe bipartisanship is n't all it 's cracked up to be .
And Harper 's a loser . "
An online stoush has broken out between the team at ABC2’s Good Game and former co-host Jeremy ‘ Junglist ’ Ray ( pictured , left ) .
Ray was let go by the gaming show after three years hosting beside Stephen ‘ Bajo ’ O’Donnell ( pictured , right ) and replaced with Stephanie ‘ Hex ’ Bendixsen .
On Monday Amanda Duthie , Head of Arts and Entertainment told TV Tonight , “ After three years , we felt Good Game needed a refresh to take the program into 2010 and beyond , and the decision was made to change the hosting team . ”
This week fans of the show have rallied behind Junglist writing furious protests online , initiaing a Facebook support group and starting a petition .
Many have criticised the move as being a token move to instil a female presenter .
Amid the fury , the Good Game team posted a united message on their ABC messageboard , attempting to allay a viewer backlash .
But under confidentiality it was unable to offer much detail on what had gone down recently , or indeed taken place behind the scenes for most of this year .
“ For all sorts of reasons we are unable to tell you things that have happened over many months inside Team Good Game which have impacted on the production .
That ’s just real life folks .
We know it leaves many questions unanswered but we have reached that point where we really can’t say any more than that .
“ But we can tell you this much …
“ The decision to take Junglist off air was not forced upon us by ABC Management and it ’s one that is fully supported by all the GG team .
We are gutted that it has come to this but in our opinion it absolutely had to happen . ”
With such a public , if coy , statement , Junglist reponded on the same forum , calling the statement a blatant lie .
“ In fact , the GG team was completely unaware of the change until the same day I found out .
The same confidentiality clause that prevented me from saying anything publicly , prevented management from telling them anything , ” he wrote .
“ I have spoken to members of the GG team who clearly DON ’T support this , but ca n’t say anything publicly .
Of course they ’ll tow the party line .
They have to . ”
Junglist says the decision was forced by ABC management .
“ I feel now as if I ’m being professionally attacked , so here ’s a truth bomb .
In the meeting where I was told I would be replaced , the reason given was they wanted a girl on the show .
‘ Mass appeal ’ was a direct quote from that meeting .
After a half - hour of explaining how they ’ll lose their hardcore following , they responded that yes , they knew this , but expected to make up the numbers with a new following .
‘ A show can grow beyond its hardcore base ’ , is another direct quote . ”
As fans grew more angry , his co-host Bajo weighed in , saying , “ We have felt professionally attacked by some of the posts by Jung , with the inability to reply due to confidentiality .
So we can not drop our own ‘ truth bomb ’ .
While Junglist may have his own version of events , so do we , and all we ever wanted to do was work with him but it ’s not to be , and we are exhuasted by the whole thing , and just want to move on . ”
Producer Syd ( who is female ) added , “ Jung mate , I ’m sorry to say it but you are wrong … no one on the team feels we have to tow the party line here – no one has been coerced into doing or saying anything they do n’t want to .
Sure we did n’t all find out till you did – but that does not mean we do n’t feel it ’s the right thing to do for the show .
That ’s the truth we need to swallow here … as bitter a taste as it might leave in our mouths . ”
So while some fans are likening the split to a bitter parental divorce , new presenter Hex has walked into an impossible situation .
When asked about the online feud , an ABC spokesperson hinted to TV Tonight there were a number of background factors that were not immediately evident and that the network stood by the Good Game team ’s statement .
In an online arena it would seem there are many who are keen to contribute to the debate from all sides , if not necessarily positioned to give the full picture .
Meanwhile Good Game appears to have a battle much bigger than World of Warcraft or Resident Evil 5 could ever imagine …

WASHINGTON  A few hours after getting off a plane from America ’s war zones , Joseph R. Biden Jr. slipped into a chair , shook off his jet lag and reflected on what he had seen .
The situation in Iraq , he said , was much improved .
In Pakistan , he said he saw encouraging signs .
Then he came to Afghanistan and shook his head .
“ It has deteriorated significantly , ” he said .
“ It ’s going to be a very heavy lift . ”
That was six days before Mr. Biden was sworn in as vice president in January , and just after he had met with President - elect Barack Obama , who had sent him on the fact - finding mission to figure out just what the new administration was inheriting .
Mr. Biden ’s assessment was even grimmer during his private meeting with Mr. Obama , according to officials .
From the moment they took office , Mr. Biden has been Mr. Obama ’s in - house pessimist on Afghanistan , the strongest voice against further escalation of American forces there and the leading doubter of the president ’s strategy .
It was a role that may have been lonely at first , but has attracted more company inside the White House as Mr. Obama rethinks the strategy he unveiled just seven months ago .
Performance vs correctness tradeoffs
I 've recently been running into a number of " benchmarks " where some rendering engines achieve better performance by simply doing the wrong thing because the right one would be " too slow " .
Here 's a good example :
// FIXME :
This check is good enough for : hover + foo , but it is not good enough for : hover + foo + bar. //
For now we will just worry about the common case , since it 's a lot trickier to get the second case right // without doing way too much re-resolution .
and here 's a testcase demonstrating that in this particular open - source rendering engine performance in selector matching and dynamic change handling is achieved at the expense of correctness :
< style > div { color : red ; } .foo + div + div { color : green ; } </style > < body onload=" document.getElementsByTagName( 'div ' ) [ 0].className = ' foo ' " >
< div></div > < div></div > < div > Text</div >
This is not exactly an isolated incident ; a number of the performance issues I 've run into recently in Gecko have had to do with correctly handling edge cases that this particular open - source engine happens to just not handle .
I guess it 's easier to do well on tests if you cheat .
More interestingly , Opera 's performance on this sort of thing is still quite good , and I have yet to discover them cheating ...
A senior at an ivy league college , who depends on scholarships and working on the side , gets accepted into the secret society The Skulls .

In the next 10 to 20 years , he said , the dollar will face growing competition from China ’s currency , the renminbi .
Though Chinese leaders have minimized their currency ’s use in international transactions , largely so they could keep greater control over exchange rates , Mr. Zoellick said the renminbi would “ evolve into a force in financial markets . ”

The World Bank , which is financed by governments around the globe and lends money primarily to poor countries , has no say over the economic policies of large nations or over currency matters .
But Mr. Zoellick ’s comments were unusual , in part because he seemed intent on being provocative .
He argued that the United States and a handful of other rich nations could no longer dominate the world economy and suggested that America was losing its clout .
He also took issue with a central piece of the Obama administration ’s proposal regarding the country ’s financial regulatory system .
“ The greenback ’s fortunes will depend heavily on U.S. choices , ” Mr. Zoellick said .
“ Will the United States resolve its debt problems without a resort to inflation ?
Can America establish long - term discipline over spending and its budget deficit ? ”
Mr. Zoellick criticized President Obama ’s plan to put the Federal Reserve in charge of reducing “ systemic risk ” and to regulate institutions considered too big to fail .
Saying that Congress had become uneasy about the Fed ’s exercise of emergency powers to bail out financial institutions and prop up credit markets , Mr. Zoellick argued that the Treasury rather than the Fed should get more power because the Treasury was more accountable to Congress .

It was about five or six years ago that I first read about the Hakka Tulou " apartments " in Yongding county , Fujian province .
And from that moment on , I was completely fixated on visiting and trying to understand more about them .
In 2008 , UNESCO granted the Tulou " apartments " World Heritage Status .
UNESCO cited the buildings as exceptional examples of a building tradition and function exemplifying a particular type of communal living and defensive organization .
The Tulou is " the most extraordinary type of Chinese rural dwellings " of the Hakka minority group and other people in the mountainous areas in southwestern Fujian , UNESCO said .
The Tulou is typically a large enclosed building , rectangular or circular in configuration , with a very thick weight supporting earth wall ( up to 6 feet thick ) and wooden skeletons , between three and five stories high , housing up to 80 families .
These earth buildings usually have only one main gate , guarded by 4 to 5 inch thick wooden doors reinforced with an outer shell of iron plate .
The top level of these earth buildings has gun holes for defense against bandits .
They are a testament to the unique cultures that exist throughout China .
It was my first trip to China that ignited my interest in becoming a photographer .
I traveled there at the age of 22 after graduating from college — the only destination on my maiden voyage to Asia .
China was ( and still is ) crowded , vast , complicated and misunderstood — it was exactly the type of challenge I was looking for .
Thinking back to that first trip , I can remember that the country was a complete sensory overload .
The sights , the smells , the noises ; it was all vastly different from what I had experienced up until that point .
That trip lasted three months and involved mostly hitchhiking through China ’s remote Xinjiang and Tibet provinces .
I had a little point - and - shoot camera and instantly became obsessed with trying to document everything I was seeing and to relate those details to friends and family back home .
When I returned to Toronto , after my first trip to the mainland , I immediately told my family I was packing up moving to China .
Two weeks later I was on a plane with my used Canon EOS 1 ( film ) camera and 50 mm lens .
I had left Toronto for good .
The spirit and the idea of being a photographer and documenting China had been born on that first trip .
China , my adopted home , had stirred up something inside of me that I did n’t know existed , very much acting as my muse for an entirely new way of thinking about and viewing the world .

Though his father was proud of him , Oliver says , he is mindful that the pub owner ’s motto remains “ You ca n’t make a silk purse from a sow ’s ear . ”
Having started out as the ear , Oliver has worked hard to prove his father wrong .
Cooking saved his life .
He wants it save yours too .
“ Being in the kitchen is the most simple part of life , ” he said .
“ People talk about it like it was some sort of science experiment . ”
In last year ’s U.K. series , “ Jamie ’s Ministry of Food , ” Oliver expanded his reach past the school system into people ’s homes .
He chose Rotherham , an industrial town in northern England with a high rate of obesity and related illnesses , where 20 percent of the working - age population was on public assistance .
He built a community center where residents could learn to cook inexpensively for their families while instilling the idea that healthful eating is not a luxury .
“ They thought that cooking a meal and feeding it to your family was for posh people , ” he said .
Some participants in the show had never even had a kitchen table .
They ate takeout food on their floors .
That project has proved a success and the perfect model for Oliver ’s mission in Huntington .
The community center here will be called Jamie ’s Kitchen and will teach both adults and children the basic skills for cooking healthful , economical meals at home .
Oliver will also work with local schools on eliminating junk food in vending machines and in cafeterias , replacing reheated processed foods with meals cooked from scratch with fresh ingredients .
But there is no guarantee of success .
In spite of the resources the British government has allocated for school lunches , Oliver admits that only half the schools are functioning properly ; the other half are still experiencing difficulty training cafeteria staff and enforcing new guidelines .
And follow - up reports show that while students now understand the benefits of eating healthfully , many still opt out of their school - lunch plans , reverting to fast food instead .
What ’s really happening is about more than old habits dying hard or the love of frying .
The reason the world is still waiting for the Messiah is that most people do n’t actually want one , no matter how many fresh fruits and vegetables he ’s carrying .
Oliver expects some of the same pushback in Huntington , whether it comes from recalcitrant teenagers , petty bureaucrats or parents who do n’t like being told they ’ve failed .
It remains to be seen whether the contest between being threatened and resentful versus forthright and true can trump the American intoxication with show business : will this much - maligned area let a Member of the British Empire play Pygmalion and win ?
In this country , ordinary people seem willing to do or say almost anything to be immortalized in the latter - day vaudeville of reality shows .
Oliver ’s goals here , no matter how authentic , can be thwarted if the balance between camera hunger and social reform goes off - kilter .
The series , “ Jamie Oliver ’s Food Revolution , ” is a co-production of his company and Ryan Seacrest Productions .
ABC will broadcast it in six parts in early 2010 .

Like Rotherham ’s , Huntington ’s economy was buoyed for years by the coal mines nearby as well as by manufacturing jobs in the chemical industry , glassworks , steel foundries and locomotive - parts plants .
In 1950 its population was near 90,000 .
Manual labor took care of excess calories , if not hardened arteries .
When the coal industry was modernized and the changing economy resulted in the loss of manufacturing jobs , the population dropped to less than 50,000 ; hospitals became one of the city ’s largest employers .
Another is Marshall University , home of the “ Thundering Herd ” football team and the subject of the 2006 film “ We Are Marshall . ”
Its students are aficionados of the delicacies at Hillbilly Hot Dogs ( a sign out front reads , “ If you hit it on the run , we ’ll put it on a bun ” ) , and Oliver does n’t blame them .
“ That was 15 pounds of madness , ” he said of the trademark burger , jumping into the car outside the restaurant .
“ But it tasted good . ”
He had been shooting all afternoon and was 90 minutes behind schedule , an occurrence his publicist calls “ Jamie Time . ”
He gets so involved in what he ’s doing that he tends to lose track .
He was due downtown in 30 minutes to hold a town - hall meeting to talk about the show .
On the way there , he agreed to run through Kroger , a local supermarket , to see what Huntington residents were buying .
( CNN ) -- A Dolton , Illinois , police officer assigned to a school was placed on administrative leave and later resigned after a surveillance video surfaced of him allegedly assaulting a special - needs student , officials said .
Videotape allegedly shows an unidentified police officer assaulting student Marshawn Pitts , 15 .
Ed Manzke , an attorney who represents the student , Marshawn Pitts , 15 , told CNN Wednesday the officer beat Pitts for not adhering to the school 's dress code .
The incident occurred in May at the Academy for Learning , a Dolton high school for special - needs students .
Pitts was admitted to the school in May after moving from Iowa , Manzke said .
He suffered brain injuries as a child when he was hit by a car .
The police officer , who has not been identified , reprimanded Pitts for not tucking in his shirt as school dress code and policy requires .
A video , released to Pitts ' parents by the school several weeks after the incident , showed Pitts talking to the officer and a faculty member grabbing Pitts ' arm .
Pitts pulls away and walks down the hall , with the officer and faculty member close behind .
But the officer then slams him against the lockers and pins him on the floor -- breaking his nose , according to Manzke .
Pitts was treated by a school nurse after the incident , then taken to the Dolton Police Department , where his mother picked him up , Manzke said .
The officer was taken to a hospital and treated for an eye scratch , Manzke said .
But , he said , the officer was never charged with anything and an explanation for the incident was never provided .
In a written statement , Guy Lindsay , internal information officer for Dolton police , said the department was made aware of the incident and the tape on May 20 .
After review of the tape , the officer was removed from the school and placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation , Lindsay said .
While on administrative leave , the police officer returned to the department and voluntarily resigned , Lindsay said .
The investigation continues , he said .
In a statement obtained by CNN affiliate WGN , the Academy for Learning said it could not comment on an incident involving a specific student .
But , the school said , " Unfortunately , the physical restraint of a student sometimes becomes necessary .
In such instances , AFL and its staff are committed to employing techniques that are safe , effective and which conform to best practice standards .
" Annually , a Behavioral Intervention Committee comprised of administrators , staff , union representatives and parents convenes to review restraint procedures .
The AFL Behavior Management Team also participates in professional development and training regarding physical restraint on an annual basis .
After a physical restraint occurs , the team meets to process , debrief and evaluate the incident and use of a physical restraint .
AFL addresses the unauthorized or inappropriate use of a physical restraint , or improper techniques , as necessary , as an internal manner . "
Pitts ' parents are considering litigation against the city of Dolton , the school and Dolton police , Manzke said .
He added he is in talks with Dolton police to settle the case .
If those talks are not fruitful , Manzke said , a lawsuit could be filed within a few weeks .
Pitts is now living with his father and attending another school , Manzke said .

This July 20 , 1969 , file photo shows astronaut Edwin " Buzz " Aldrin Jr. standing beside the U.S. flag deployed on the moon during the Apollo 11 mission .
WASHINGTON ( AP ) NASA 's weakened return - to - the - moon program got a lift Tuesday on Capitol Hill .
The head of a special expert panel conceded to Congress that the moon program could work if given enough money .
That would mean another $ 3 billion a year for the program proposed by President George W. Bush .
The plan has been under question because of that panel 's dim look at NASA 's future and concerns about support from the Obama administration .
The panel issued its preliminary summary last week , concluding that there is not enough money to explore space in the current budget , including the moon plan .
" With the resources available , the program I think is fatally flawed , " testified Norman Augustine , head of the panel of experts appointed by President Obama .
But congressmen from both parties , including the wife of an astronaut , came to the 5 - year - old moon plan 's defense .
They even attacked the Augustine panel for referring to the plan in the past tense at one point .
" I do n't see the logic in scrapping what the nation has spent years and billions of dollars to develop , " said House Space Subcommittee chair Gabrielle Giffords , D - Arizona .
Her husband is astronaut Mark Kelly , who will command a mission next year .
NASA said it has spent nearly $ 8 billion already and plans to spend at least $ 100 billion by 2020 .
Giffords said there needs to be compelling reason to change the program .
She pressed Augustine for a reason and said she was angry over the " glancing attention " the panel gave to the current program .
Augustine , retired chief executive officer of Lockheed Martin Corp. , said the panel put the current program — with the extra funding — as one of several options for the president to choose among .
The White House told the panel not to recommend one over the other , he said .
Having already spent lots of money is not reason alone to continue with the Bush plan , Augustine told The Associated Press after the hearing : " the sunken costs argument does n't carry much weight with us . "
After Augustine left , former NASA Administrator Michael Griffin — in an unusual move for a recent ex-space program chief — came to the defense of his pet project .
Griffin agreed with the Augustine report in saying there was not enough money in the current budget to explore space and go anywhere new .
Griffin noted that Presidents Obama , Bush and Bill Clinton all essentially cut NASA spending , with a drop of about 20 % since 1993 .
But Griffin in his written testimony defended the Bush moon program 's technical design and emphasized that it should continue with the extra money .
He said Congress should ask Obama and the Augustine commission " exactly why does the policy which we established in law — twice — need to be changed ? "
" As I see it , the commission did n't find anything wrong with the current program , did n't find anything safer , more reliable , cheaper or faster , " Griffin testified .
" The roots are healthy .
So why throw away four years and $ 8 billion pulling the flowers ?
Let 's apply some plant nutrient and watch them grow . "
The Bush moon plan involves building two new Apollo - type rockets .
The first and smaller one , Ares I , would carry people .
The later and larger one , Ares V , would carry equipment .
But the Augustine commission said it does n't make much sense to build Ares I .
Instead it preferred building only the Ares V and make it carry people and equipment if some version of the Bush plan is kept .
Last week , after an initial problem , the main rocket engine on Ares I passed a crucial test firing .
George Washington University space policy expert John Logsdon said the big test is what the Obama administration will decide once it examines the full Augustine commission report , which is due out later this month .

According to the Huffington Post , the President of Dr. Bronner ’s Magic Soup Company was arrested Tuesday morning while trying to plant industrial hemp seeds on the lawn of the headquarters of the DEA .
David Bronner ’s company profits more than ten million dollars annually from the help of sales of hemp made soaps .
Industrial hemp is classified by the US government because it has a minute level of THC in it .
Even though you could smoke a few hundred pounds to the dome , you most likely would not get high what so ever .
Industrial hemp can be used for a variety of things , textiles , paper and even fuel .
I know Dr. Bonner was trying to make a point that America should wake up and start looking at hemp as a product that can help the nation , but he also is going to spend some time in jail for his little stunt .
My hat is off to you Dr. Bonner , I think I am going to go buy a bar of your soap to support your looming legal bills .
HUMISTON PARK , Fla. , Oct. 9 ( UPI ) --
A mile - long stretch of beach in South Florida has reopened after workers removed hundreds of piles of manatee excrement , officials said .
Workers at Humiston Park Beach along Vero Beach spent hours cleaning up the mess Thursday after the Indian River County Environmental Health Department identified it as manatee waste , TC .
Palm.com reported .
The workers buried the waste several feet beneath the sand .

" I 've never seen anything like it , and I 've lived along beaches all my life , " said Bill Becker , who goes to Humiston several times a week .
" It was disgusting , but mystifying .
It looked like Great Dane poop all along the beach . "
Charles Vogt , an environmental health specialist , said manatees migrating along the coast may eat as much as 100 pounds of sea grass a day each , but it is unusual for their excrement to wash ashore .
He speculated recent high winds may have stirred up the ocean bottom , sending the waste to the beach .
Oct. 23 , 2009  --
The details of the Obama administration 's efforts to curb excessive compensation on Wall Street emerged Thursday , with dual announcements from pay czar Kenneth Feinberg and the Federal Reserve Board .
And while the potential loopholes do not appear large enough to drive the proverbial armored truck through , the securities industry is already set on finding ways to continue to pay traders and investment bankers exceptionally well , by any measure .
" Whether by deferring compensation over a couple of years , or paying more of it in the form of stock , the majority of Wall Street firms will still be able to pay people very well , in some cases more than before , " said Eric Moskowitz , head of compensation consulting at New York - based Options Group , a global executive search firm focused in the financial industry .
With so much public scorn directed toward Wall Street 's traditional practice of back loading a year 's worth of compensation via " incentive - based pay " ( i.e. bonuses ) , a number of firms have gone ahead and boosted base salaries .
Historically , base salaries on Wall Street have been a relatively small part of a trader 's or investment banker 's total annual pay package .
Senior people , such as managing directors , could , in past years , expect to collect base salaries of around $ 200,000 , according to Options Group , which produces extensive annual surveys on securities industry pay trends .
But Moskowitz said that in the past six months , some of those same managing directors , including some at banks that accepted Troubled Asset Relief Program funds , saw base salaries bumped up to $ 500,000 or more in light of the bonus backlash .
Keeping Top People
" Firms ca n't just sit back and lose all their best people to rivals , " Moskowitz said , citing large scale defections at UBS earlier this year as examples of what can happen when compensation gets curbed .
In a move that was widely applauded , UBS announced at the start of 2008 it would not pay any bonuses .
The firm instead , Moskowitz explained , upped many key staffers ' base pay .
Both Feinberg and the Federal Reserve have set sights on significantly reforming Wall Street pay practices , releasing simultaneous overviews of their intentions Thursday .
The Feinberg plan tries to halve the average combined compensation of the 25 highest paid employees at companies that were the biggest bailout beneficiaries , including Citigroup , Bank of America and AIG .
A Federal Reserve Board proposal , meanwhile , is aimed at reviewing and overhauling compensation trends in the financial industry in general , with an eye toward ensuring better alignment of pay and proper risk management practices .
Wall Street Pay Cuts ?
Execs May Still Do Fine
" I 've tried to balance both sides , listening carefully to what is said in the way of citizen anger and also the statute , which requires that these companies stay in business and thrive so we get repayment , " Feinberg said in an interview with ABC News Thursday .
Even as the first details of the Feinberg plan were being leaked earlier this month , speculation got underway on the street as to whether the effort would average together top executives ' salaries and then slash them by half -- something that could be subject to some gaming .
That 's because top executives , such as Citigroup CEO Vikram Pandit , had already accepted massive pay cuts .
Pandit said earlier this year he would work for $ 1 a year -- which , in theory , could have upended the equations and allowed other executives to get paid as usual .
Treasury officials confirmed , however , that Feinberg 's plan will address top earners and that salaries will be determined on a case by case basis .
' Independent Contractors '
Deutsche Bank reportedly has flirted with the concept of paying some bankers as independent contractors -- not treating them , at least technically , as employees , according to one industry source .
One compensation consultant , Steven Hall of Steven Hall & Partners , has followed the issue closely and says he believes there wo n't be much wiggle room , particularly for the TARP - bound financial firms , Citigroup , Bank of America and AIG .
" They wo n't be able to play games or get cute , " Hall said .
" More likely these firms will work with Feinberg and get his blessing on ways to pay people if they feel they are at a disadvantage . "
For most of the major Wall Street firms , which either paid TARP money back or turned it down altogether , lucrative pay practices can , in theory , continue unencumbered .
However , several large banks , including Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs , have indicated they are re-evaluating pay practices after public outcry over outsized bonuses on Wall Street .
Wall Street Pay Cuts ?
Execs May Still Do Fine
Goldman Sachs ' public revelation that as of the end of the third quarter it had already set aside , for accounting purposes , approximately $ 16.7 billion for employee compensation and benefits prompted widespread condemnation from public officials , among them Christopher Dodd , chairman of the Senate Banking Housing and Urban Affairs Committee .
Dodd , on NBC's " Meet the Press , " described Wall Street pay as outrageous .
Neil Barofsky , special inspector general overseeing the TARP program , has also fired some shots recently .
The TARP had some restrictions on money that went to the institutions and on executive pay , but other government support programs , by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC , have no conditions , Barofsky has noted .
" So you see some of these institutions , even though they have paid back their TARP funds , they 're still relying on government programs , " Barofsky told CNN Thursday .
" They are still reaping these profits based on cheap money and support given to them by the federal government . "
According to research conducted by the office of the New York State Comptroller , Thomas DiNapoli , 165,000 New York City securities industry professionals were paid $ 18.4 billion in year - end bonuses in 2008 , a fairly staggering sum , despite tumultuous markets .
That tally was actually down 44 percent from the $ 32.9 billion bonus pool the comptroller 's office tabulated in 2007 .
Loopholes
" Basically , when it comes to Wall Street pay , where there 's a will there will be a way , " said Michelle Leder , an analyst at New Haven , Conn . - based securities research firm Research Edge .
" If they set limits on base pay , they 'll figure out a way to make up for it with options or restricted shares or some other sort of thing that has n't yet been devised . "
About a decade ago , Leder pointed out , Congress set limits that essentially placed limits on executive compensation at $ 1 million .
" But all it did was lead to excessive option grants to make up for the base salary limits , " she added .
In response to the Fed 's announcement on pay , Timothy Ryan , CEO of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association , said in a written statement issued Thursday , that " these proposed rules will likely affect compensation for hundreds if not thousands of professionals working in our industry .
We appreciate the Federal Reserve addressing the regulation of compensation policies through a standard rulemaking process , allowing market participants and interested parties to provide substantive comments to their proposal . "
BofA , indicating that Feinberg 's decisions have put them at a competitive disadvantage when it comes to retaining employees , released the following written statement Thursday : " Our compensation practices have historically aligned pay with company performance and shareholder interests and delivered a significant portion of compensation over time to encourage sustainable profitable growth and sound business decisions .
We have continued to work this year to further align our pay to performance , including implementation of enhanced performance - based claw - back provisions and a greater percentage of stock provided with delayed access by the employee in the global banking and markets businesses . "

How Fort Irwin Just Signed The Largest Solar Farm in Dept of Defense History : 1,000 MW
October 16th , 2009 by Susan Kraemer
In a win-wIn move for the US Army and the USA , a mutually beneficial financing arrangement was signed this week between the US Army and a new partnership ( “ Irwin Energy Security Partners LLC ” ) comprising Clark Energy Group and multinational solar power giant Acciona .
By using Enhanced Use Leasing they can now not only finance the solar project for Fort Irwin , but double the size to 1,000 megawatts .
The solution they came to this week provides a model for how to get around the difficulties encountered by utility scale solar companies in getting past NIMBY opposition and other roadblocks to developing big solar in the desert .
[ social_buttons ]
System to be built :
A 1,000 MW mixed solar thermal and solar PV power station will be built at Fort Irwin in stages , that is orders of magnitude larger than the 14 MW solar farm at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada and the 2 MW installation at Fort Carson in Colorado .
The 5,000 recruits at Fort Irwin would only use 35 MW .
The first phase will produce more than 500 MW of renewable energy or 1,250 gigawatt hours per year of solar power by 2022 .
What the Army needs ( and gets ) :
Net - zero energy .
The US Army is under very strict requirements to get off fossil fuels fast .
( previous story )
But it ’s hard for the Army finance its own solar development as does n’t have the authority to sign 30 year contracts .
As recently as August , when we covered the initial proposal , the US Army Energy Program Developer , Kevin Geiss was quoted as worrying that while they had the land and the demand ; the problem was financing .
At that time , only 500 megawatts was being considered .
What it has and gives :
What the Army has to offer is longterm ownership of 14,000 acres of prime NIMBY - free land … in the Mojave desert .
With a water supply and high - power transmission lines .
It ’s the nations largest military base .
What the company needs and gets :
A longterm lease on land for as long as they need it in order to get payback on a huge 1,000 MW solar system that will supply the grid with the energy to earn its payback .
What it has ( and gives ) :
The financial wherewithal to get it done .
And fossil - free power to supply the base with what it needs .
First they will cover the needs of the base , 100 % .
By 2014 , Fort Irwin will be running net - zero fossil fuels , 100 % solar powered .
They will deliver services such as operation and maintenance over the years and send the extra power to the grid .
Win Win
It enables Fort Irwin to get 100 % of its energy needs covered by solar power , while a private company gets to build a large solar farm on prime Mojave Desert land perfect for solar with a long term lease and access to transmission to sell the remaining extra power it can generate .
So , in exchange for a long lease , they signed an agreement to build and maintain what will ultimately be a 1,000 MW solar system , to be built in five stages , funded by energy sales to the grid .
What the USA needs and gets :
And it ’s a huge win for the USA .
We get the change .
965 MW of gorgeous sunshine power from the Mojave desert .
( And a model for future solar development on Army owned land . )
What we have and give :
A courageous Department of Energy that awarded the builder , Clark Energy Group a $ 5 billion Super Energy Savings Performance Contract , and a US Army smart enough to pick Acciona , a 100 year old company with 20 years of renewable development experience .
We also put together the landmark renewable energy EUL that enables the development of a 1,000 megawatt solar power station by swapping what we need and what we have .
Great news for all of us and congrats to Fort Irwin for inking this great deal for the US Army and the USA !

Walker in Mississippi trawling for pro-segregationist cock
While wasting time yesterday I looked up that bizarro rightwing “ patriot ” General Edwin A. Walker , who was fired by Kennedy for insubordination , and who was later allegedly nearly shot by Oswald in Texas , and who was tied to the notorious “ JFK Wanted For Treason ” flyer distributed in Dallas on the day of Kennedy ’s assassination .
( I posted that flyer in my last entry on the JFK - Obama Repeat scenario . )
Gen .
Walker was yet another in a long illustrious line of closet homosexual tea - bagger Republicans who , after the assassinations wound down and the South gave up fighting desegregation , ended his days in public toilets trying to suck off undercover cops a - la Larry Craig .
But Gen .
Walker ’s spirit lives on , as these chilling New York Times articles below show .
One thing that ’s particularly interesting is what a true patriot Ike was , going against the insane wing of his party to support the President , despite their ideological differences .
Compare that to W ’s sulking - groundhog act , or Cheney ’s role in firing up the crazies .
Also note that the far - rightwing John Birch Society which led the radical anti-JFK movement branding him a traitor was co-founded by none other than Fred Koch of Koch Industries .
Like father , like sons : today , sons Charles and David Koch are co-founders and major funders of FreedomWorks , the Tea Party movement , Americans for Prosperity , and the crazy - rightwing movement branding Obama as a traitor .
New York Times , November 19 , 1961 , page 1 KENNEDY ASSERTS FAR - RIGHT GROUPS PROVOKE DISUNITY
Attacks Birch Society and ‘ Minutemen ’ at a Party Dinner in Los Angeles Spread of Fear Scored President Says Real Threat Comes From Without , Not Within by Tom Wicker LOS ANGELES , Nov. 18 – President Kennedy spoke out tonight against the right - wing John Birch Society and the so - called Minutemen in a speech at a Democratic Party dinner here .
The President mentioned neither group by name but left no doubt whom he meant .
[ In Atlanta , Senator Barry Goldwater , Arizona Republican , attacked the “ radicals in the White House . ”
At a news conference , he called President Kennedy the “ wagon master ” who is “ riding on the left wheel all the time . ” ]
The President , in his talk at the Hollywood Palladium , also made his first public response to Edward M. Dealey , publisher of the Dallas Morning News .
Mr. Dealey attacked the President at a White House luncheon for “ riding Caroline ’s tricycle ” instead of being “ a man on horseback . ”
Some ‘ Escape Responsibility ’
“ There have always been those fringes of our society who have sought to escape their own responsibility by finding a simple solution , an appealing slogan or a convenient scapegoat , ” Mr. Kennedy said .
Now , he continued , “ men who are unwilling to face up to the danger from without are convinced that the real danger comes from within . ”
“ They look suspiciously at their neighbors and their leaders , ” he declared .
“ They call for a ‘ man on horseback ’ because they do not trust the people .
They find treason in our finest churches , in our highest court , and even in the treatment of our water . ”
“ They equate the Democratic Party with the welfare state , the welfare state with socialism , and socialism with communism .
They object quite rightly to politics ’ intruding on the military — but they are anxious for the military to engage in politics . ” …
Mr. Kennedy chose a region in which the John Birch Society has some of its strongest support to make his third and sharpest attack on what he called tonight “ the discordant voices of extremism . ”
In the first two speeches , at Chapel Hill , N. C. , and Seattle , he also warned against left - wing and pacifist extremists .
His remarks tonight were directed to far - right groups and individuals .
The reference to “ armed bands of civilian guerillas ” appeared to be directed at the Minutemen , individual groups of which are being organized and armed in some parts of the country .
The organization is reputed to be particularly strong in California .
Los Angeles is regarded as almost the heartland of the Birch Society .
Two Republican Representatives from its urban districts , John H. Rousselot and Edgar W. Hiestland , are avowed members . …

New York Times , November 19 , 1961 , page 54 RIGHTISTS PICKET KENNEDY SPEECH 3,000 Parade in Los Angeles in Orderly Demonstration LOS ANGELES , Nov. 18 – Raucous picketing took place outside the Hollywood Palladium where President Kennedy spoke .
For nearly an hour , 3,000 persons paraded , carrying signs and chanting and singing their protests over a variety of issues .
The demonstration , which started rather mildly five hours before the President spoke , was suddenly stepped up by an apparent influx of rightists .
Some of the signs carried by men and women wearing red , white , and blue paper hats , read : “ Unmuzzle the Military , ” “ Clean Up the State Department , ” “ Veto Tito , ” “ Disarmament is Suicide , ” and “ CommUNism is Our Enemy . ”
The marchers sporadically chanted “ Test the Bomb , ” and , “ No Aid to Tito . ”
They sang , among other things , “ God Bless America ” and “ The Battle Hymn of the Republic . ”
A much smaller contingent of pacifist marchers was elbowed out .
Most of these carried signs urging the end of all atomic testing …

New York Times , November 19 , 1961 , page 54 Eisenhower Travels Aloft With Kennedy SHERMAN , Tex. Nov. 18 ( AP ) — President Kennedy and former President Dwight D. Eisenhower rode together to Perrin Air Force Base near here by helicopter today after attending the funeral of Sam Rayburn at near - by Bonham .
Senator Carl Hayden , Democrat of Arizona , was also on the helicopter .
Mr. Kennedy and General Eisenhower stood together talking by the side of the aircraft for about two minutes .
Mr. Kennedy gestured repeatedly with his left hand and appearing to be explaining something to General Eisenhower .
General Eisenhower listened intently and shook his head affirmatively several times .
They shook hands .
Mr. Kennedy then walked briskly to his plane and General Eisenhower got into an Air Force automobile .

or years , heating problems have prevented CPU manufacturers from building viable CPUs with clock rates higher than 4.0GHz .
This single - core processor speed limitation means that the only viable way to make programs run faster is to run them on more than one processor .
Consequently , manufacturers started making processors with multiple cores ( i.e. , multiprocessor CPUs ) .
In fact , you can expect to see processors with more than 100 cores in the near future .
In order to fully exploit the potential of these new processors , software developers will be forced to write parallel programs .
As Herb Sutter wrote regarding Moore 's law : " The Free Lunch Is Over . "
The transition wo n't be easy , though , because writing concurrent programs is hard work .
The main framework for parallel computing in the past 30 years has been single processes , threads , or programs that communicate with one another by reading and writing in a shared memory area and using locks and semaphores .
In multiprocessor CPUs , the individual cores talk to each other mainly by sending asynchronous messages .
This framework requires you to pay a lot of attention to mutually exclusive algorithms to avoid the simultaneous use of common resources or side effects such as deadlocks from using semaphores .
This article introduces the functional language Erlang , a good choice for writing parallel programs , and explains how you can use it to fully exploit current and future multicore CPUs .
Meet Erlang
Designed at Ericsson laboratories in 1986 , Erlang ( named for Danish mathematician Agner Krarup Erlang ) is used largely in the telecommunications industry .
Nevertheless , it is a general - purpose , functional programming language that belongs to a more comprehensive rather than imperative class of declarative languages .
One of its most important features is its implementation of concurrent computation according to the Actor model , a mathematical schema that implies that everything is an actor ( much like the object - oriented philosophy of everything is an object ) .
Because an actor sends and receives messages and accordingly acts and creates other actors , the Actor model is inherently concurrent , whereas the object - oriented paradigm is practically sequential .
The Erlang software concurrency paradigm leaves no space for state .
You can assign variables only once and must perform iteration through recursion .
No state means you do not need memory protection , which minimizes side effects as well as the amount of data shared between processes .
Erlang functions are similar to mathematical functions : with the same input they return the same value , regardless of the context of the call .
Erlang functions pass each parameter by value , so anything that you can reference is a value .
This feature is called reference transparency .
Although variable assignments are subject to strict rules , Erlang partially makes up for that restriction using a powerful mechanism called pattern matching .
This feature is similar to the way human beings interpret reality by determining similarities between real objects and the conceptual schemas in their minds .
Is 2012 the end of the world ?
If you scan the Internet or believe the marketing campaign behind the movie “ 2012 , ” scheduled for release in November , you might be forgiven for thinking so .
Dozens of books and fake science websites are prophesying the arrival of doomsday that year , by means of a rogue planet colliding with the Earth or some other cataclysmic event .
Normally , scientists regard Internet hysteria with nothing more than a raised eyebrow and a shake of the head .
But a few scientists have become so concerned at the level of fear they are seeing that they decided not to remain on the sidelines this time .
“ Two years ago , I got a question a week about it , ” said NASA scientist David Morrison , who hosts a website called Ask an Astrobiologist .
“ Now I ’m getting a dozen a day .
Two teenagers said they did n’t want to see the end of the world so they were thinking of ending their lives . ”
Advertisement
Morrison said he tries to reassure people that their fears are groundless , but has received so many inquiries that he has posted a list of 10 questions and answers on the website of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific ( www.astrosociety.org).
Titled “ Doomsday 2012 , the Planet Nibiru and Cosmophobia , ” the article breaks down the sources of the hysteria and assures people that the ancients did n’t actually know more about the cosmos than we do .
“ The world will not come to an end on Dec. 21 , 2012 , ” E.C. Krupp , director of Los Angeles ’ Griffith Observatory , declared in a statement released Thursday by the observatory and Sky & Telescope magazine .
Krupp debunks the 2012 doomsday idea in the cover story of the magazine ’s November issue .
Morrison said he attributes the excitement to the conflation of several items into one mega -myth .
One is the persistent Internet rumor that a planet called Nibiru or Planet X is going to crash into the Earth .
Then there ’s the fact that the Maya calendar ends in 2012 , suggesting that the Maya knew something we do n’t .
Finally , end - of - the - worlders have seized upon the hubbub about the 2012 date to proclaim their belief that end times are drawing near .

Morrison , who heads the Lunar Science Institute at the Ames Research Center in Northern California , has coined a term for the phenomenon : “ cosmophobia , ” a fear of the cosmos .
According to Morrison , for the most vulnerable among us , all of the things we ’ve learned about the universe in the last century have only increased the number of potential threats to our existence .
Besides fearing a rampaging planet , the worriers think the sun might lash out at the Earth with some calamitous electromagnetic force .
They also fear that some sort of alignment between the Earth and the center of our galaxy could unleash catastrophe .
Krupp said that the scare - mongers would have us believe that the “ ancient Maya of Mexico and Guatemala kept a calendar that is about to roll up the red carpet of time , swing the solar system into transcendental alignment with the heart of the Milky Way , and turn Earth into a bowling pin for a rogue planet heading down our alley for a strike . ”
According to Rosemary Joyce , a professor of anthropology at UC Berkeley , the Maya never predicted anything .
The 2012 date is approximately when the ancient calendar would roll over , like the odometer on a car ; it did not mean the end -- merely the start of a new cycle .

Some authors have tried to merge that idea , Joyce said , with Maya mythology that said the Earth had gone through multiple ages of creation , each ending in a disaster .
“ But there ’s no prediction , ” she said .
“ They did not predict the end of the world . ”
Morrison says it ’s hard to know whether the people who have written to him with their fears represent a fringe or a larger cross-section of Americans who , distrustful of traditional sources of information and the authorities behind them , are falling victim to the Internet ’s snake - oil salesmen .
In such an environment , the viral marketing campaign for the movie “ 2012 , ” which encourages people to “ Vote for the Leader of the Post - 2012 World , ” can seem like confirmation of the apocalypse , rather than of an upcoming 90 - minute entertainment vehicle .
A spokesman for Sony Pictures , Steve Elzer , said : “ We believe consumers understand that the advertising is promoting a fictional film . ”
Advertisement
Morrison said the movie ’s distributors are feeding the “ panic ” by creating some of the fake science websites .
Most of the sites , Morrison said , are full of misinformation and speculation , often by people who have written books they are trying to sell .
Morrison said he could not address the motives of people who were feeding the alarm , but added : “ It ’s wrong to tell lies to frighten people merely to make a buck . ”
What most worries him is the level of alarm in some of the most recent messages .
“ I ’m getting more and more questions from people who are upset and scared , ” he said .
Some people say their children are refusing to eat .

In the publication Morrison has posted online , he says that astronomers would long ago have spotted a rogue planet headed for Earth , that the so - called photos of Nibiru on the Internet are fictitious , and that just because the Maya calendar in question ends in 2012 , it does n’t mean the Maya were predicting the end of the world .
“ The calendar on my desk ends on December 31 , 2009 .
I do not interpret that to mean the world is going to end that day . ”

Dubai , a Persian Gulf boomtown where Porsches share the road with truckloads of South Asian laborers , launched a mass - transit rail system Wednesday in an effort to ease crippling traffic that costs the city - state an estimated $ 1.4 billion a year .
Despite recent economic reverses , the railway in this United Arab Emirates city of superlatives -- home to palm - shaped artificial islands and the world ’s tallest building -- will sport a showy attitude .
The system will include VIP cars with fares equivalent to $ 3.55 , more than seven times the lowest - cost ticket .
The $ 7.6 - billion automatic rail system , under construction since 2005 and 80 % over budget , made its inaugural journey Wednesday night with several hundred contest winners as passengers , news reports said .
Service opens to the public today .
Initially only 10 of the 29 stations will operate on the Red Line .
It runs from the airport through downtown , across the Dubai Creek and along lengthy Sheik Zayed Road adjacent to luxurious new high - rise towers , some of them unfinished because of the global economic downturn .
Advertisement
The Green Line is expected to open over the next year , expanding the system to about 47 stations along 46 miles of railway .
Only 5 % of Dubai residents use public transportation , but authorities are hoping to raise that number to 20 % by keeping regular fares between 50 cents and $ 1.50 , the same as the bus system .
Rapid transit is an element of public space and life in cities such as New York , London and Paris .
Many wonder whether Dubai ’s rail system can make a difference in a city defined by individualism and gated communities .
In seeking to establish itself as an international commercial center , Dubai championed exclusivity over accessibility , investing little in public space .
Authorities are highlighting the grandeur of the new rail system over its convenience .
But the system , which will run both above and below ground , might end up changing public attitudes anyway .

“ There ’s a lot of emphasis on this being a luxurious public transportation system , which will distinguish Dubai from New York or London , ” said Tabitha Decker , a Yale University researcher and a visiting scholar at the Dubai School of Government , who is writing her dissertation on the development of the metro .
“ It ’s about aesthetics and commercialism , but when you combine it with the fact that this is also a public good , this is a bit of a surprising moment in Dubai ’s history .
It ’s not fitting into our idea of what Dubai is , ” she said .
“ I think it ’s something Dubai should be proud of . ”
But some Dubai residents were skeptical about the metro’s practicality , pointing out that the initial route runs only along Sheik Zayed Road .
Ghassan Abdul - Sater , a 26 - year - old Dubai resident and Lebanon native who is in advertising , said he would continue to drive to work rather than brave the hassle of public transportation .

“ Parking somewhere to use the metro and then get off and walk to work ? ” he said .
“ I think I ’ll have minimal uses ” for the metro .
Scrap car on sale for £ 300 on eBay fetches £ 140,000 after bidders discover it 's actually historic racer
A simple eBay auction turned into an epic bidding frenzy when a car thought to be scrap turned out to be one of the world ’s rarest vehicles .
The rusty car – which has no engine or transmission – was initially put up for sale in the U.S. with a starting bid of $ 500 ( £ 300 ) .
But after one eBay user realised the battered 1963 Pontiac LeMans Tempest was in fact one of six specially - made Super Duty versions , it eventually sold for nearly $ 227,000 ( £ 140,000 ) .
Secret past :
The battered 1963 Pontiac LeMans Tempest turned out to be one of just six Super Duty editions
Notice anything missing ?
The car was missing an engine and transmission .
The first bidder offered just £ 300
What helped boost sales even more during the nine - day auction was that it also appeared to be one of the cars driven by American drag racing legend Stan Antlocer .
The car 's plexiglass windows , unusual suspension setup and a dash board bearing the name of a racetrack tipped bidders to its racing history .
But it was all a shock to the seller , 123eclin , who had n’t expected to get more than a few hundred dollars for the rusting classic .
Reading through the questions on the auction gives us reason to believe the seller truly did n't know the car 's provenance .
Suspicion : Eagle - eyed eBay users noticed the suspension set up was different to a regular Tempest LeMans
Final clue : Bidders discovered its racing history by the dash board which bears special dials and a track name
In his answers , he seems both surprised by the car 's potential value as well as overwhelmed by the attention .
With only seven minutes remaining , the highest offer was $ 95,000 .
When the virtual gavel fell , eBay user ccsi2000 had bought a very rare , if a little rusty , LeMans for $ 226,521 .
Historic :

For nearly half a decade , Ralph Nader — lawyer , consumer advocate , winner of five - tenths - and - six - hundredths of one per cent of the popular vote in 2008 — has been secretly working on his first novel , writing drafts and making edits on multiple Underwood Standard typewriters .
Nader does not feel comfortable referring to the book as a novel , even though everything in it is made up .
He says that the work belongs to a new genre , one that he calls “ a practical utopia , ” and defines as “ a fictional vision that could become a new reality . ”
The book , called “ Only the Super - Rich Can Save Us ! , ” is seven hundred and thirty - six pages long , and it contains dozens of characters , many of them real people — Warren Buffett , Barry Diller , and Ted Turner , among others — who act out Nader ’s political fantasies .
By the last page , most of the reforms that Nader has been arguing for all these years end up being enacted .
Corporations are neutered .
Third parties win .
America is reborn .
A few weeks ago , Nader was working the phones in Washington , trying to reach the people he had fictionalized .
“ I feel that if I am going to do that to people , I want to give them all a heads up , ” he said .
“ It ’s been done to me , you know . ”
In the novel “ Still Life with Woodpecker , ” by Tom Robbins , published in 1980 , Nader appears as the romantic obsession of a mythical princess ( “ She fell quickly asleep and dreamt of Ralph Nader ” ) .
Five years later , the science - fiction writer Greg Bear wrote “ Eon , ” which portrays Nader as “ a saintly figure , a hero in a wasteland , ” whose followers win landslide elections in North America and Western Europe ( in 2011 ) and bring down the Soviet Union ( in 2012 ) .
“ You see , that ’s science - fiction utopia , ” Nader said .
“ Nobody can give that any credibility . ”
Nader had reached about half of his characters .
“ A lot of them are hard to get , ” he said .
“ Barry Diller is in Asia . ”
One billionaire was “ a little snippy , ” he said .
Others were more amenable .
Ted Turner sent a thank - you note .
Phil Donahue , a lifelong admirer , was flattered .
Yoko Ono , who in the book invents a logo called Seventh - Generation Eye that causes millions of people suddenly to shed their political apathy , sent Nader a brief reply .
( “ I think it is so sweet of you to write a book about somebody who resembles me .
I do n’t mind at all , of course .
Does she look like a tiny dragon ? ” )
Warren Beatty , whom Nader envisions running for governor against Arnold Schwarzenegger , and winning , with sixty - three per cent of the vote , blurbed the book .
Nader , he wrote , was showing the world “ how good he thinks things could be . ”
Leonard Riggio , the chairman of Barnes & Noble , who is portrayed as an anti-corporate activist , funding protests across the country , was stumped .
“ I read a bit of it , and I said , ‘ My God , what is this ? ’ ” he said .
Robert Price , the son of Sol Price , a founder of Price Club , skimmed the sections of the book in which his father promotes industrial hemp and launches an attack on Wal - Mart that forces the company to unionize .
“ None of this connects at all , ” he said .
A delicate call went to Grover Norquist , the president of Americans for Tax Reform .
Nader and Norquist are the political equivalent of matter and anti-matter — Nader ’s career has been devoted to strengthening government , Norquist ’s to eviscerating it — but the two maintain a friendly rivalry .
“ I like Ralph , and I have warm fuzzies for him on a number of levels , ” Norquist said , recalling how he once invited Nader to one of his Wednesday strategy sessions .
( “ He was clearly traumatized , ” he added . )
In the book , Nader refers to those sessions as gatherings for the “ greed and power brigades , ” and fashions Norquist as the book ’s principal villain , a conservative evil genius named Brovar Dortwist , who is defeated by a torrent of progressive campaigns , including a TV ad featuring a squawking parrot .
Norquist had not yet read the book .
“ He told me that I would n’t be too unhappy , because the character was principled , ” Norquist said .
He seemed to relish the role that Nader had given him in utopia .
“ I am all in favor of having the left win in fiction , ” he said , but he wondered about the odd pseudonym .
( “ Brovar ? ” he asked .
“ Is that even a real name ? ” )
As Norquist learned more about the details of his character , one could sense another budding novelist emerging .
Brovar Dortwist owns a Doberman named Get ’Em , and Norquist said , “ I do n’t like dogs .
He should have checked .
I used to have a six - foot - long red- tailed boa constrictor named Lysander Spooner — after the great nineteenth - century anarchist .
We had him for most of the nineties , until my staff decided that he was large enough to eat a child . ” ♦
Population is on the increase and the world cannot contain or sustain it ( Image : Michael Duva / Getty )
THINK of the biggest crowd you ’ve ever been in – perhaps 50,000 in a sports stadium .
Just 6 hours from now there will be that many more people in the world , and another 50,000 in the following 6 hours , and on and on …
No wonder that the burgeoning human population is often seen as is the single biggest problem facing our world .
There are nearly 7 billion humans alive today , twice as many as there were in 1965 , with 75 million more being added each year .
UN predictions say there could be an extra 2 to 4 billion of us by 2050 .
The planet has never experienced anything like it .
Can the world sustain this growing horde ?
It ’s a contentious question .
While it is clear that the population cannot go on increasing forever , history is littered with dire but failed predictions of famine and death resulting from over - population .
Most famously , Thomas Malthus warned more than two centuries ago that population would be held in check by rising mortality .
What he failed to anticipate was the ability of newly industrialised societies to support large numbers of people .
Today , the “ population problem ” is firmly back on the agenda .
Earlier this year the UK government ’s chief scientific adviser John Beddington predicted a population - led global crisis by 2030 , and a group of influential billionaires including Bill Gates and George Soros identified overpopulation as the greatest threat facing humanity .
Every time we publish an article in New Scientist detailing yet another of the planet ’s environmental woes , readers …
As one who has studied and written on federal criminal law for the past seven years , I have concluded that the ultimate goal for federal prosecutors is to be able to target anyone and charge him or her with a crime .
I hardly am exaggerating , as the following article from Slate demonstrates :
At the federal prosecutor ’s office in the Southern District of New York , the staff , over beer and pretzels , used to play a darkly humorous game .
Junior and senior prosecutors would sit around , and someone would name a random celebrity — say , Mother Theresa or John Lennon .
It would then be up to the junior prosecutors to figure out a plausible crime for which to indict him or her .
The crimes were not usually rape , murder , or other crimes you ’d see on Law & Order but rather the incredibly broad yet obscure crimes that populate the U.S.
Code like a kind of jurisprudential minefield : Crimes like “ false statements ” ( a felony , up to five years ) , “ obstructing the mails ” ( five years ) , or “ false pretenses on the high seas ” ( also five years ) .
The trick and the skill lay in finding the more obscure offenses that fit the character of the celebrity and carried the toughest sentences .
The result , however , was inevitable : “ prison time . ”
Today , they have the weapons to do the preceding with ease , and the weapons are so powerful that I can guarantee that everyone reading this article is a felon .
That ’s right ; you , too , are a criminal and if a federal prosecutor targets you , then you are going to prison .

You might not have robbed a bank or stolen anything , or engaged in any of the 10,000 " crimes " that federal prosecutors have in their buffet line , but I can guarantee that you are " guilty " of " honest services fraud . "
Have you ever taken a longer lunch break than what you are supposed to do ?
Have you ever made a personal phone call at work or done personal business on your employer ’s computer ?
Have you ever had a contract dispute with an employer or a client ?
All of those things can be criminalized by an enterprising federal prosecutor .
If you are an attorney and have signed forms even though you have not read every word in them ( for example , the standard closing documents for real estate ) , then you have committed " honest services fraud . "
The list goes on and on , but most likely by now you have the picture : you are guilty even if you never are placed in the dock in federal criminal court .
As one person intimately familiar with these kinds of prosecutions told me , " This is better than RICO , " and the RICO statutes have proven to be one of the ultimate weapons used by federal prosecutors .
Just the threat of invoking RICO can make even tough defendants turn into pliable putty ready to plead out instead of going to trial .
Just ask Michael Vick .
Jeffrey Skilling right now is serving more than 20 years in prison , as the former Enron CEO was convicted of " honest services fraud . "
Former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich is under indictment for the " crime , " and the feds currently are investigating the archdiocese under Catholic Bishop Roger Mahony to see if they can secure indictments under this statute .
From former college basketball coaches to politicians , " honest services fraud " has become the ultimate prosecutorial weapon , and prosecutors are quick to declare their support for it .
According to the Wall Street Journal :
… prosecutors love it .
Patricia Pileggi , a former prosecutor who has brought honest - services fraud cases , says “ since you do n’t have to prove loss of money , the statute is easier for prosecutors to use ” than extortion or bribery statutes .
In fact , this particular law , first passed by Congress as an amendment to a wire and mail - fraud statute in 1988 , allows federal prosecutor to do what prosecutors always have dreamed of doing : circumvent Constitutional protections against the accused by both creating what essentially are bills of attainder and ex post facto law .
Let me explain .
The Road to Serfdom : T... F. A. Hayek , Bruce Cal ... Best Price : $ 3.06 Buy New $ 1.99 ( as of 03:40 EST - Details )
First , and most important , the law itself is vague .
According to the statute , Congress has criminalized “ a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services , ” but how does one define " honest services " ?
And who is deprived ?
Those questions are answered by prosecutors seeking indictments and convictions , and it is they who decide what is " criminal " and what is not .
Although the question of guilt ultimately is supposed to be left to a jury , the very presence of such broadly - interpreted criminal laws with draconian penalties of 20 years or more in prison will lead many innocent people to plead out to something because the risk of going to trial is too great .
Because federal prosecutors see their job as being a " hammer " and they see everyone else as a " nail , " it is clear that the loose and vague language in the statute involving an " intangible right " to services of others is an open - ended invitation for prosecutors to craft charges around whatever alleged act they wish to criminalize , even if the act itself is legal .
This is the very essence of a bill of attainder .
Second , because all - too - often an act is interpreted as being " criminal " after the fact , in essence , prosecutors are able to go back to an act that everyone believed to be legal and effectively apply a criminal statute to it .
This is the essence of ex post facto law , which is unconstitutional .
In a remarkable joint move by two ideologically - opposing groups , the Heritage Foundation and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers wrote in a February 11 , 2009 , letter to Congress that this law creates " a charter of authority for courts to decide , retroactively , what forms of unfair or questionable conduct in commercial , public and even private life should be deemed criminal . "
There is another huge problem with this law ( if we can dignify it as such by even calling it " law " ) : its vagueness and broad interpretation permits federal prosecutors to engage in tyrannical selective prosecution .
When a law is so broad that nearly everyone who provides any services has broken it , then prosecutors are able to target people who might be politically unpopular .
For example , despite the fact that Jeffrey Skilling did not break the law by putting some of Enron ’s assets in " special purpose entities , " which were included in the company ’s financial statements , nonetheless prosecutors were able to convince jurors that his actions were criminally fraudulent .
Although Victoria Sprouse was not charged with " honest services fraud " when she recently was railroaded in federal court , nonetheless federal prosecutor Matt Martens told the jury that because she had admitted to not reading every word in every by - the - numbers legal document she signed , she had committed " honest services fraud . "
Now , if someone like Martens wanted to launch prosecutions against professional people for not reading documents they sign , why is he not bringing criminal charges against members of Congress , who rarely read bills that either they approve or vote down ?
For example , John Conyers , D - Michigan , recently caused a stir when he admitted that he did not read bills before him .
So , here is a lawmaker openly admitting that he does not read legislation , and he hardly is alone .
( Few , if any , members of Congress read the Patriot Act or the Sarbanes - Oxley Act before approving them overwhelmingly . )
There is no substantive difference between what Martens deemed as " fraud " with Victoria Sprouse and what the nation ’s elected representatives do every day they are in session .
In fact , one could argue that at least Sprouse knew the substance of the documents before she signed ; many senators and representatives cannot tell their constituents the content of the legislation before them .
Yet , Sprouse is going to prison and members of Congress do not have to worry about prosecution ( at least for violating that statute ) .
Journalist Gary S. Chafetz recently wrote about " honest services fraud , " pointing out that even the language of the law itself is a fraud :
One of the cardinal rules of a grade - school vocabulary test is this : the word that the student must define cannot be used in its definition .
However , honest - services fraud — “ a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services ” — is a term that no one seems able to define without using “ honest - services ” in its definition .
Which a priori implies that because it cannot be defined , it is unconstitutionally vague .
This horrible law is 20 years old and only now is the U.S. Supreme Court even beginning to look seriously at it .
The court has agreed to hear the appeal of recently - convicted media figure Conrad Black who is in prison after a federal jury convicted him of " honest services fraud . "
Unfortunately , I doubt the High Court will do anything to upset federal prosecutors , who pretty much own the federal " justice " ( sic ) system , lock , stock and barrel .
The Best of William L. Anderson
You do n't have to be stuck with the manufacturer 's configuration interface ; you can replace the software on your wireless router .
Replacing the firmware can also give you enhanced and advanced features usually found in high - end equipment .
Let Eric Geier , author of Wi-Fi Hotspots : Setting Up Public Wireless Internet Access , describe the highs and lows of aftermarket firmware projects .

You do n't have to spend hundreds or thousands to get the enterprise features for your router .
You can turn your cheap wireless G or N router into a Swiss Army networking tool :
Use it as a repeater , mesh node , or a regular wireless access point ( AP ) .
Plus you can use additional features to provide secure remote access , link your offices together , offer hotspot access , and much more .
You get this type of functionality by replacing the factory firmware of your router with third - party firmware .
You do n't replace or modify the hardware ; you are just giving it a new brain teaching it new tricks .
Firmware consists simply of a few - megabyte file that you upload via the router 's Web - based configuration screen or by using a transfer method like TFTP .
Once you 've flashed the router with the new firmware , the router will have new Web - based configuration screens .
The screens should be organized in a somewhat similar fashion to the factory GUI .
You should be able to easily change the general wireless and network settings .
Then configuring some of the advanced features may require reviewing the FAQs , a Wiki , or any tutorials .
In the next few sections , you 'll discover a few different replacement firmware projects .
DD -WRT
DD - WRT seems to be the most popular , feature - rich , and updated replacement firmware out there .
Its first versions were based on the Alchemy firmware from Sveasoft , another firmware developer I 'll discuss .
Like similar projects , DD - WRT adds features that surpass what the hardware vendors offer in consumer - grade routers .
However , DD - WRT also has a few features that other firmware projects do n't offer , such as support for X86 - based systems ( PCs ) .
DD - WRT can operate in modes other than just a regular wireless access point ( AP ) .
These modes already give you much more flexibility over the hardware or routers and can be a money saver .
In Client mode , for example , it can connect to another Wi-Fi network to get an Internet connection and then share it ( in a different subnet / network ) to computers plugged into the router 's Ethernet ports .
The Bridge mode is similar , but the DD - WRT router does n't provide a segregated network ; computers connected to its LAN ports will act just as if they were connected directly to the originating router or network router .
In Repeater mode , DD - WRT can take a Wi -Fi signal from another network or router and retransmit it .
Plus it forwards any incoming traffic coming onto the source network or router .
For example , if the signal on your network needs to go a little farther , you can put a DD - WRT router into Repeater mode .
You 'd position it somewhere between the source wireless router or access point ( AP ) and the client needing a betters signal .
Then the client can connect to the repeater and DD - WRT can act as a middle man or repeater , wirelessly transmitting traffic to and from the client and network .
Other enterprise - type features in the open source firmware include the support of VLANs and virtual SSIDs .
You can segregate traffic between different groups and offer varying types of wireless security .
Quality of service ( QoS ) controls are included so you can better manage the network and Internet traffic , especially useful if you are hosting public access or have sensitive applications , such as VoIP or gaming .
This firmware replacement can also serve as a client or server for VPN connections via the OpenVPN or PPTP protocols .
This gives remote users secure access to the network for file access or to simply encrypt Wi -Fi hotspot connections from local eavesdroppers .
Plus if you have multiple locations or users working remotely at a certain spot , you can set up LAN - to - LAN or site - to - site VPN tunnels .
That way , all the network locations can be tied together securely via the Internet .
This firmware project does n't stop at the private network ; it provides hotspot features as well .
It can be turned into a simple hotspot with NoCatSplash , a more advanced system with Chillispot , or use the Sputnik management system .
It 's also possible to set up a router to offer both a public and private network .
DD - WRT also offers more remote administration features .
It has an integrated server and client for both SSH and Telnet , ntop for remote statistics , and a site survey feature that shows details of nearby APs .
They 've added storage features as well , such as support for JFFS2 , MMC / SD cards , USB , and Samba .
Using DD - WRT also gives you more freedom over the router .
You can customize the startup , firewall , and shutdown scripts .
See some examples here .
You can also adjust the transmit power .
( 0 - 251 mW , default is 28 mW , 100 mW is safe ) .
Researchers found mercury in every fish tested in a nationwide stream survey , with some of the higher concentrations showing up in mining areas of the West .
In about a quarter of the fish , levels of the toxic metal exceeded federal standards for people who eat an average amount of fish .
“ This study shows just how widespread mercury pollution has become in our air , watersheds , and many of our fish in freshwater streams , ” U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said in a press release .
The study , conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey , sampled 34 fish species at 291 stream sites across the country from 1998 to 2005 .
The most contaminated sample came from smallmouth bass in the Carson River in Dayton , Nev. , a historic gold mining area .
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
Signs of gold fever are everywhere .
TV commercials scream , " Sell your baubles , prices are reaching the sky ! "
Investors have poured more than $ 12 billion this year into SPDR Gold Trust ( GLD ) , the big exchange - traded fund .
Top - ranked manager John Hathaway of the Tocqueville Gold Fund ( TGLDX ) offers this astounding prediction :
The price of the precious metal could rise to more than $ 5,000 an ounce .
And if that 's not enough to convince you , gold futures for December delivery rose $ 27 to an intraday record high of $ 1,045 an ounce in New York trading Tuesday .
But amid the buying frenzy and after a decade - long run-up that has seen the price quadruple , is gold still a smart investment ?
The simple answer :
Wherever the price of gold is headed in the long term , several market watchers say the fundamentals indicate that gold is poised to fall .
And even if you fret that the government 's pullout - all - stops effort to rescue the financial system and revive the economy will lead to inflation , there are better hedges than the yellow metal .
Gold has moved in huge swings since the economy started to crack in 2007 .
The price closed above $ 1,000 for the first time on March 14 , 2008 , just before Bear Stearns was sold to J.P. Morgan ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) , then fell to near $ 700 last November before rising again past $ 1,000 last month .
Bulls argue that gold still has more to gain :
As the national debt balloons , the result is bound to be a weaker dollar and higher inflation -- both traditionally bullish for gold .
Jim Rogers , the investor who predicted the commodities boom earlier this decade , expects gold to pass its inflation - adjusted 1980 peak of $ 2,312 .
" Gold is going to be much higher over the course of the bull market , in a decade or however long it lasts , " he says .
Rogers , who in the past has criticized the Federal Reserve for being lax on inflation , considers gold the ultimate safe haven in times of financial stress .
But he thinks other commodities trading far from their all - time highs -- cotton and lead , for example -- might offer better returns , along with inflation protection .
Hathaway , who manages $ 1 billion at the Tocqueville fund , sees gold soaring for several reasons , including rising inflation and the rather curious fact that in two previous instances the price of an ounce of gold and the level of the Dow Jones industrial average have come close to converging .
In 1933 , when gold traded at $ 32 an ounce , the Dow bottomed out at 50 in February .
In 1980 gold climbed to its high of $ 850 on Jan. 21 , when the Dow closed at 873 .
Today Tocqueville sees something similar happening , with gold rocketing to $ 5,000 or $ 10,000 an ounce ( the Dow is now at about 9700 ) .
Those projections are tantalizing .
But when you look at supply and demand , gold loses some of its luster .
Gold miners have poured more than $ 40 billion into new projects since the bull market began in 2001 , according to Montreal - based bullion dealer Kitco .
Like Big
Oil explorations started earlier this decade amid rising energy prices , new gold projects are now bearing fruit .
Mining output was up 7 % in the first six months of 2009 , after several years of declines , as China , Russia , and Indonesia have ramped up production .
Kitco predicts that new mining will add 450 tons annually , or 5 % , to the gold supply through 2014 , enough to move prices lower .
On top of that , $ 1,000 gold brings out gold scrap sellers .
In the first half of 2009 alone , high prices attracted 900 tons of gold jewelry , old coins , and other scrap .
Industrial and jewelry demand , meanwhile , has fallen 20 % in the past year , according to GFMS , a precious - metals research group .
Kitco analyst Jon Nadler says gold is setting record prices amid " some of the poorest fundamentals I 've seen in the market for a long time . "
He suspects the recent rise has been driven by large hedge funds and institutional investors making momentum - driven trades .
As for fears of financial collapse , " The sky did actually fall last year -- and it was good for $ 1,035 gold , " says Nadler .
" But that 's about where the worst ends . "
So the short - term outlook is not promising .
But what about long - term protection against inflation ?
Money manager Rob Arnott , chairman of Research Affiliates , whose strategies are used to manage $ 43 billion in assets , believes the inflation rate could climb above 5 % in two to three years and that investors should dedicate a quarter to a third of a portfolio to inflation protection .
But he 's not a fan of gold , which , he says , basically tracks inflation over the long term , leaving you a loser after taxes .
" Gold is not a sensible core holding , " he says .
Like Rogers , Arnott thinks common commodities are a smarter choice .
He suggests iShares GSCI ( GSG ) , an ETF that tracks the broad S&P commodities index .
Arnott also likes using Treasury Inflation - Protected Securities , real estate investment trusts ( REITs ) , and emerging - market bonds , which you can buy through the PowerShares Emerging Market Sovereign Debt ETF ( PCY ) .
Many developing countries are commodities producers , so if U.S. inflation kicks in , their currencies will gain strength and their debt will rise in value .
This is a big month for NASA .
The Augustine committee , appointed by the White House to review NASA 's human space flight programme , is set to release its final report on Thursday .
The panel has created a menu of five plans for the space agency .
It has given each 12 scores in various categories ( PDF ) , including science benefits , safety , benefit to the US workforce and schedule .
The committee says it will not assign single overall scores to the options in its final report , so New Scientist has ranked the five plans by adding up the category scores that have been read out by the committee in public meetings .
These scores are on a scale of - 2 to 2 .
So in ascending order , here are the results – and the main pros and cons .
( Image : Nigel Hawtin / New Scientist )
1 The status quo
If NASA continues on its current path with no extra money , its new Ares I rocket and Orion capsule ( planned design illustrated here ) will not be ready until after the International Space Station has been de-orbited – which is scheduled to happen in 2016 .
The return to the moon for which Ares and Orion have been designed would not happen until " well into the 2030s , if ever " , according to the committee 's summary report
Destination reached : ISS ( but only until 2016 , when it is de-orbited )
For : safety ( 0 ) – astronauts stay relatively safe by not venturing beyond Earth orbit
Against : schedule ( - 2 ) – human moon landings still wanted , but lack of funds could postpone them indefinitely
Overall score : - 15
( Image : NASA )
2 An ISS extension and a cash - strapped moon programme
In this option , Ares I is cancelled and NASA sends astronauts to the ISS on commercial vehicles such as SpaceX's Dragon capsule , shown here .
A moon return plan may run out of money .
Destinations reached : ISS , moon ( maybe )
For : international cooperation ( 0 ) – NASA support extends ISS to 2020 , pleasing international partners
Against : schedule ( - 2 ) – human moon landings still wanted , but lack of funds could postpone them indefinitely
Overall score : -5

3 The status quo , but with extra money
With $ 3 billion a year more in its budget , NASA could return astronauts to the moon , but only by sacrificing the ISS after 2015 .
Destinations reached : ISS , moon
For : schedule ( 0 ) – human moon landings by mid-2020s
Against : international cooperation ( - 2 ) – NASA support for ISS ends in 2015 , to the dismay of international partners
Overall score : - 1
( Image : NASA )
4 Return to the moon first , but no further for now
This option also requires an extra $ 3 billion .
One version of it would delay retiring the space shuttle and use a close derivative of it , seen here , for trips to the moon .
The other version would get there with a variant of the Ares V rocket .
Both versions would use commercial vehicles to access the ISS , which would be extended to 2020 .
Destinations reached : ISS , moon
For : US skills retention ( 0 ) – one version of this option delays space shuttle retirement to 2015 , which helps retain workers with key skills
Against : public engagement ( 0 ) – the committee believes returning to the moon will excite the public less than going to new destinations , as in option 5
Overall score : 4 or 5 , depending on variant

Security firm Symantec estimates that 93 % of computer users who wind up with ' scareware ' on their machines have intentionally downloaded it .
Symantec also believes some people distributing the scareware could be earning more than a million dollars each year .
Scareware involves giving Internet surfers bogus scans of their machines , often triggered by pop-up messages on Internet sites falsely claiming the user 's PC is infected .
The user is then encouraged to buy a fake antivirus / security program to remove it , though usually this program will be of little use .
Symantec says it has found more than 250 different bogus programs .
That 's because the real goal of the exercise is to get hold of the credit card details of the user when they buy the sham security software .
Resellers of Fake Antivirus Make Millions
Symantec 's research revealed that most scareware is distributed by individuals working on a commission basis .
They earn anything between a cent and 55 cents for every " customer " they persuade to buy the software .
The rate varies depending on the nationality of the customer , with those from the United States valued most highly , apparently because they are most likely to have a high credit limit .

According to the research , some of the best - performing affiliates are making more than $ 100,000 / month .
One company which has since been shut down claimed that its top sellers made $ 332,000 a month , though that has n't been confirmed .
( Source : reuters.com )
43 Million Downloads Per Year , Estimated
It 's not known how many people have fallen victim to such scams , though the researchers estimated there were 43 million attempts to download scareware in the space of a year .
The research concludes that because the amounts involved in each case are comparatively small , usually less than $ 100 , law authorities do not give the issue as much attention as it deserves .
There ’s a local brunch place in the city called Orange .
I have n’t been there in forever ( there ’s always a huge line and , if I ’m being honest , I think it ’s sort of gone downhill ) but I randomly was thinking about their cinnamon roll pancakes the other day .
I thought about taking a ( relatively long ) walk there during lunch , but ultimately decided I would try to make my own over the weekend .
I could n’t remember exactly what ’s in the pancakes ( like I said , it ’s been a while ) so I looked at the description on the menu .
I ’m pretty sure they have candied pecans on them too , though … not that mine did .
I do n’t candy things at 8 am on a Saturday .
At any rate , these were easy enough to whip up and tasted great .
For the maple - pecan paste I literally just used toasted pecans and maple syrup ( but do n’t worry , no paste ) and blended them in a food processor .
I did n’t add a whole lot of syrup though because I knew these would be topped with glaze ( and maybe more syrup ) and did n’t want them to be TOO over the top .
The pancakes are nice and cinnamony and I ’ve always loved pecans as a complement to both pancakes and waffles .
My glaze was a little runny because I added too much milk and did n’t feel like adding more sugar to thicken it ( since it tasted fine ) but otherwise , these were a nice change of pace from my normally boring ( and usually over - the - top healthy ) breakfasts .
Oh , also , this will be my last post for a while !
The hubs and I are taking a vacation to Florida so it will probably be a week and a half or so before I ’m back .
Think happy no -rain thoughts for me , please .

ZURICH , Switzerland ( CNN ) -- Turkey and Armenia signed an agreement Saturday night establishing diplomatic relations after nearly a century of animosity .
Armenian and Turkish ministers sign accord as dignitaries , including U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , look on .
The signing was delayed because of Armenian objections to the wording of a final oral statement intended to be given after the signing .
However , neither the Armenians nor the Turks gave a closing statement after the signing .
No further details were immediately available .
The agreement will open their common border within two months after it is ratified by each country 's parliament .
The border has been closed since 1993 .
Turkish - Armenian relations are often overshadowed by the dispute over the massacre of ethnic Armenians in the final days of the Ottoman Empire , more than 90 years ago .
Armenians accuse Ottoman Turks of committing genocide , killing more than a million Armenians beginning in 1915 .
Turkey vehemently rejects these allegations .
A complicating issue is the " frozen conflict " in neighboring Nagorno - Karabakh , an ethnically Armenian enclave in Azerbaijan .
Turkey closed its border with Armenia after Armenia attacked Azerbaijan over the territory .
Watch report on the signing from CNN's Ivan Watson »
During the U.S. presidential campaign , then - candidate Barack Obama called for passage of the Armenian genocide resolution .
Since his election , he has stepped back from the issue .

* SEIU asks for pay czar to stop Lewis ’ severance package
* Group says BofA should increase lending first
* Lewis ’ stands to get $ 125 million when he leaves ( Corrects to clarify $ 125 million includes retirement benefits , accumulated stock and other compensation , not just retirement benefits ; adds company comments )
WASHINGTON , Oct 8 ( Reuters ) - A top U.S. labor group on Thursday asked the Obama administration 's " pay czar " to stop any retirement payments to Bank of America BAC.N Chief Executive Ken Lewis .
The Service Employees International Union sent a letter to pay czar Kenneth Feinberg , calling Lewis “ one of the chief architects ” of the economic crisis and saying he should not receive any retirement or severance package until the bank stops foreclosures and increases lending .
“ Taxpayers have already provided nearly $ 200 billion in bailouts and backstops to Bank of America , ” the letter said .
“ This enormous public investment entitles taxpayers to have a say in the bank ’s executive compensation practices . ”
Bank of America announced last week that Lewis will leave the company by year - end .
Lewis ’ package includes $ 53.2 million in retirement benefits , mostly from a pension program frozen years ago , and $ 72.8 million in accumulated stock and other compensation , according to an analysis by New York - based compensation consultant James F. Reda & Associates .
Feinberg , serving as the government ’s pay czar for the financial bailout program , does not necessarily have explicit authority over Lewis ’ severance package because the contract may pre-date his authority .
But Congress gave Feinberg broad authority to issue advisory opinions that could impact Lewis .
SEIU said Bank of America , under the management of Lewis , has restricted lending to consumers and small businesses while raising interest rates and failing to modify distressed home loans .
A Bank of America spokesman disputed both the SEIU ’s figures - noting the bank received only $ 45 billion in public assistance - and what Lewis would receive on retirement .
The group said Feinberg should stop any severance payments to Lewis until Bank of America commits to stop foreclosures , provide more affordable loans , lower interest rates on credit cards , and reform pay practices so they are in line with shareholder interests .
“ The American people are counting on you to reform the reckless culture of Wall Street that allows bank executives to drive our economy into the ground and walk away with millions , ” the letter said .

California Governor Signs AB962 Restricting Ammunition
Sacramento , CA –-( AmmoLand.com ) - AB962 , the bill that would restrict ammunition sales in California was signed this past evening by Governor Schwarzennegger .
The bill will take effect on February 1 , 2011 .
His comments are below :
“ To the Members of the California State Assembly : I am signing Assembly Bill 962 .
This measure would require vendors of handgun ammunition to keep a log of information on handgun ammunition sales , store ammunition in a safe and secure manner , and require the face to - face transfer of ammunition sales .
Although I have previously vetoed legislation similar to this measure , local governments have demonstrated that requiring ammunition vendors to keep records on ammunition sales improves public safety .
These records have allowed law enforcement to arrest and prosecute persons who have no business possessing firearms and ammunition : gang members , violent parolees , second and third strikers , and even people previously serving time in state prison for murder .
Utilized properly , this type of information is invaluable for keeping communities safe and preventing dangerous felons from committing crimes with firearms .
Moreover , this type of record keeping is no more intrusive for law abiding citizens than similar laws governing pawnshops or the sale of cold medicine .
Unfortunately , even the most successful
local program is flawed ; without a statewide law , felons can easily skirt the record keeping requirements of one city by visiting another .
Assembly Bill 962 will fix this problem by
mandating that all ammunition vendors in the state keep records on ammunition sales .
As Governor , I have sought the appropriate balance between public safety and the right to keep and bear arms .
I have signed important public safety measures to regulate the sale and transfer of .50 caliber rifles , instituted the California Firearms License Check program , and promoted the use of microstamping technology in handguns .
I have also vetoed many pieces of legislation that sought to place unreasonable restrictions and burdens on firearms dealers and ammunition vendors .
Assembly Bill 962 reasonably regulates access to ammunition and improves public safety without placing undue burdens on consumers .
For these reasons , I am pleased to sign this bill . ”

Yesterday , while touring a new building on Microsoft 's campus , I came across an anechoic chamber : A room designed to eliminate all noise from outside — and in .
I spent about 5 minutes locked inside , and man is it freaky .
Advertisement
The chamber is actually its own " box - in - box " building , like the Time Warner Center 's Rose Theater .
It rests on a cushion of massive springs and is linked to the rest of the building with a metal gangway and nylon netting ( so you do n't fall down into the gap ) .
There are two doors , massive ones that were , according to my guide , " a huge pain to install . "
When I went to close one , I was startled by its resistance .
Inside , it 's like the Star Trek version of the proverbial padded room , with wedges that act as sound and RF - proofing .
The second massive door is covered with these , so when it is closed , the only way to tell where the exit is is the almost - hidden release lever .
The " floor " is n't a floor at all :
The real floor has to be covered with the same sound - damping wedges , so you actually stand on a mesh trampoline .
( Good thing I did n't wear my high heels . )
Advertisement
The company who built it , Eckel Industries , also built Steve Orfield 's lab in Minneapolis , Guinness - certified as the quietest place on earth , at around - 9dBA .
Microsoft says that theirs measures something quite similar to this , except on the very lowest end , where it 's really hard to eliminate unwanted sound .
Since I entered the chamber with two other people , the first thing I noticed was how voices changed .
They became clipped , truncated , like someone was holding the mute pedal down on a piano .
The subtle atmosphere and depth associated with room reverberation that we come to expect when hearing the human voice was totally gone .
No echoes , hence the term " anechoic . "
My own voice sounded like it was having trouble coming out of my head .

For a moment , I felt genuine disorientation , like the light - headedness you can get with low blood sugar .
The guy who showed me the room said that , even though he works in there a lot , he still has moments when he loses his balance , because the ear uses sound reflections — in addition to inner-ear leveling — to position the head and body .
Microsoft uses this newly built chamber to test all kinds of hardware products — microphones on webcams , audio outputs on Zunes , even the clicking of buttons on just about anything — because if you want to hear a sound clearly , this is where you go .
They bring in the Xbox and PS3 to see which one wheezes the loudest , and some people have already inquired about squeezing the slim PS3 in for a quick listen , to see what 's changed .
( Needless to say , Microsoft would n't make the results of this test public . )

I have heard that being in an anechoic chamber for too long can drive you mad , and now that I 've stood in one , gently bouncing on the wire - frame trampoline , staring at the pointy sci- fi wedges and hearing nothing but the blood rushing in my head , I believe it .
" Does being an ' artist ' trump being a rapist ? " asks Melissa Silverstein of Women & Hollywood .
According to 138 people in the film industry who signed a petition demanding the immediate release of Roman Polanski from Swiss custody , yep !
And they 're joined by another group of writers and artists Bernard - Henri Lévy is rounding up !
On his roster : Salman Rushdie , Milan Kundera , Neil Jordan , Isabelle Adjani , Isabelle Huppert , Mike Nichols , Diane von Furstenberg , and Paul Auster , among others .
As for the other petition ( launched by French film industry association SACD ) , in addition to the signatories posted at The Wrap last night ( Pedro Almodovar , Wes Anderson , Darren Aronofsky , Monica Bellucci , Stephen Frears , Tilda Swinton ?!? ) , new big - name rape apologists are signing on all the time !
Today , we can add Martin Scorsese , David Lynch , Terry Gilliam and — wait for it — Woody Allen to the list .
Woody Allen , people .
It would be kind of funny , if it were n't a big fucking list of celebrities who support a child rapist .

Also , let us not forget Whoopi " rape - rape " Goldberg , and of course Debra Winger 's statement as president of the Zurich Film Festival jury .
As Variety reported :
Whoopi On Roman Polanski : It Was n't ' Rape - Rape '
This morning on The View , the ladies took it upon themselves to untangle the Roman Polanski affair , Read more
Winger ... on Monday demanded Polanski's release and criticized Swiss authorities for their " philistine collusion " in arresting Polanski as he entered the country .
" This fledgling festival has been unfairly exploited , and whenever this happens the whole art world suffers , " Winger said in a statement on Monday , standing together with the other four international jury members who wore red badges reading " Free Polanski " as they announced plans to continue the fest .

That 's apparently what this is about , in the minds of all these great artistes : Philistinism .
A failure to appreciate A ) Polanski 's genius and B ) the sanctity of international film festivals .
No , I am not even kidding about the second part .
From the SACD petition :
By their extraterritorial nature , film festivals the world over have always permitted works to be shown and for filmmakers to present them freely and safely , even when certain States opposed this .
The arrest of Roman Polanski in a neutral country , where he assumed he could travel without hindrance , undermines this tradition : it opens the way for actions of which no one can know the effects .
Advertisement
Yes I can totally see how arresting a fugitive child rapist is a slippery slope toward censorship .
If I were a creative professional , I 'd certainly be concerned about the authorities coming after me and my work !
Except , I am a creative professional , and I 'm not worried , because unlike Roman Polanski , I have neither raped a child nor jumped bail and evaded capture for three decades .
See how that works ?
Do n't rape a child and flee sentencing for it : Enjoy your personal and artistic freedom !
Rape a child and flee :
Get arrested !
( Eventually . )
Is there something I 'm missing here ?
Like the part that explains how arresting a fugitive child rapist has fuck - all to do with festivals traditionally being a haven for controversial filmmakers ?
Is that really supposed to mean they should also be a haven for known felons ?
I guess so .
The petition continues :
Roman Polanski is a French citizen , a renown and international artist now facing extradition .
This extradition , if it takes place , will be heavy in consequences and will take away his freedom .
Advertisement
How - HOW - are people writing and signing shit like that with a straight face ?
Might I remind you , film industry , that the extradition will be " heavy in consequences " and take away his freedom because he raped a child and fled the country over thirty years ago ?
We 're really just supposed to skip over that detail ?
Really ?
And in fact , we should more properly be outraged that this happened in a country " where he assumed he could travel without hindrance " — an assumption made because he 's been banging around Europe for three decades , making movies , winning awards , living as a free man , on account of how he skipped bail after pleading guilty to statutory rape ?
On what planet is , " But he did n't think he'd get caught ! " a legitimate excuse for going easy on a fugitive child rapist ?
Fugitive .
Child .
Rapist .
Just keep saying it until it sinks in .
I 'll wait .
And I 'll keep waiting while Lévy and company give the same exercise a shot .
Perhaps when they 're done , they 'll appreciate the absurdity of a statement like , " Apprehended like a common terrorist Saturday evening , September 26 , as he came to receive a prize for his entire body of work , Roman Polanski now sleeps in prison . "

Correction : Polanski was not actually arrested like a " common terrorist . "
He was arrested like a common fugitive child rapist .
Actually , he was arrested like a distinctly uncommon fugitive child rapist , what with being on his way to pick up a lifetime achievement award for a body of work largely completed while he was evading being sentenced for raping a child .
That 's really not how things play out for most fugitive child rapists , as I understand it .
I 'm pretty sure only the white , wealthy , well - connected ones are ever permitted to make such a mockery of justice for so long , let alone be assured that , as the SACD petition puts it , " Filmmakers , actors , producers and technicians — everyone involved in international filmmaking — want him to know that he has their support and friendship . "
I 'm guessing , in fact , that Roman Polanski could most accurately be described as a unique fugitive child rapist .
Lévy 's next argument is that Polanski's victim , whom he refers to as " the plaintiff , " wants the charges dropped , so what 's the big deal ?
Yesterday at Salon , I explained why , despite my deep sympathy for the victim and the media circus she 's been subjected to , I do n't think her wishes should take precedence over the law .
So today , I 'll only point out that the victim is not the plaintiff in the criminal case .
She was the plaintiff in the civil case she brought against Polanski , for which she was awarded a settlement .
Now , it 's Los Angeles County 's score to settle , on behalf of the people , not the victim .
Advertisement
Of course , many of the celebs standing up for Polanski are people of Los Angeles County .
Let 's just hope the authorities remember that although those might be the loudest ones , they 're hardly the only ones .
And the public interest is , in fact , better served by punishing people who rape children and flee the country than it is by bowing to famous and powerful people who somehow believe that really good films make up for felonies — or that living , traveling , and working openly in your chosen profession for 30 years , just on a different continent , is " punishment enough . "
( But the poor man was always looking over his shoulder !
Yes , because he was a fugitive child rapist .
Do you see how it always ends up there ? )
I 'm just sickened to see some of the names on these lists — people I 've long admired , and whose work I 've shelled out for on multiple occasions .
But at the same time , I 'm glad the names of unapologetic child rapist supporters are being made public , so I can consider their stance on art vs. child rape when choosing how to spend my entertainment dollars .
Last summer , Tiger Beatdown 's Sady Doyle proposed that we join her in a game she likes to call " Do n't Give Money To The Rapist . "
Basically , most rapists have jobs .
Sometimes they 're really good at their jobs !
But if , for example , a rapist is someone who makes movies which you want to see , you have to balance what you do n't know with what you know .
Here 's a little breakdown , as far as this relates to noted rapist Roman Polanski , and the film Rosemary 's Baby : WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW :
Whether or not you are going to enjoy Rosemary 's Baby , a film made by noted rapist Roman Polanski .
It could go either way !
WHAT YOU KNOW : Roman Polanski raped someone .
Now , ask yourself : is it worth contributing , in any way , to the well - being of a rapist ?
Probably not !
Advertisement
I think that sounds like a superfun game , and I also think I 'd enjoy one called , " Do n't Give Money To People Who Think Rapists Deserve Absolution , Sympathy , Freedom and Regular Public Tongue Baths . "
Unfortunately , playing it basically means you can never watch a movie again .

LG ’s first Android handset has made its official debut , in the shape of the LG GW620 .
A slider device with a pull - out QWERTY keyboard and 3 - inch touchscreen , LG ’s press information for the GW620 does n’t confirm many of the exact specifications ; however , they do make clear that they will be supporting Android as well as – rather than instead of – Windows Mobile .
The smartphone was previewed last week , as the LG Etna , on a Vodafone stand .
There it was confirmed to have a 5 - megapixel camera , Bluetooth and USB connectivity .
LG have also seemingly done some work on the UI , though not to the extent of Motorola MOTOBLUR or HTC Sense ; instead it looks as though LG ’s S - Class UI has been ported over to Android .
No pricing details , but the LG GW620 will arrive in Q4 2009 , though so far the company have only confirmed that it will ship to “ select European markets ” .
US availability is unknown .
Press Release :
The chances of another disastrous round of voting in Afghanistan 's presidential race increased dramatically today after the country 's election authority defied international pressure to cut the number of polling centres in order to reduce fraud .
To the fury of UN officials in Kabul , the so - called Independent Election Commission ( IEC ) announced that it planned to open 155 more polling stations – up from 6,167 to 6,322 – than during the first vote on 20 August , despite repeated claims by the UN that there would be a reduction .
Ever since an official inquiry uncovered almost 1 m fraudulent votes cast in favour of the president , Hamid Karzai , the country 's western backers have insisted that fewer centres should be opened in the run-off next Saturday .
But the IEC said assurances by Afghanistan 's security chiefs that conditions had improved in some areas of the country allowed for the opening of more centres .
In the first round , polling stations operated in areas that were so insecure that election monitors were unable to deter wholesale ballot stuffing .
Karzai's main opponent , Abdullah Abdullah , had said he would only participate if 500 polling centres were closed and the head of the IEC was sacked .
UN staff said the IEC decision meant voting would take place in areas where fraud was known to have been committed , or in areas where almost no one had previously turned out to vote .
A western diplomat involved in organising the vote said the news was a " punch in the stomach , because everything we asked them to do they rejected " .
He said it had shattered morale among election workers , already at a low ebb after six UN members of staff involved in election preparations were killed by a Taliban hit squad in an attack on a guesthouse in Kabul yesterday .
" This – on top of yesterday 's incident – there really is only so much you can take , " he said .
It was reported last night that the UN had ordered all non-essential staff to leave the country .
Officials told the Times that about 1,000 UN workers not involved in the voting were told to return to their home countries during the election period because of the security situation .
Despite claims by Richard Holbrooke , the US special envoy to the region , that fraud would be reduced in the second round , election observers in Kabul believe a clean vote is impossible .
" It 's going to be a fraudulent election , we can't kid ourselves on that , " one diplomat said .
" The only thing that could stop it now would be if the international community as a whole decided to distance themselves from this election , and that 's not going to happen . "
One election observer said the US and the UK had already turned a blind eye to many of the IEC 's failings in the first round of voting " for the sake of looking forward " .
For example , no pressure had been put on the IEC to even publish its full results for the 20 August poll .
" They will present those views to the president , collectively and individually , " a Pentagon official said .
" The chiefs ' views in regard to [ troop ] resources will be an important factor . "
According to an analysis by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe , the IEC 's final published tables has missing or incomplete results for more than 4,000 polling stations .
Nor has the IEC explained why it did not follow orders from the UN - appointed watchdog , the Electoral Complaints Commission , to annul results from 210 polling stations .
The IEC only cancelled votes cast in 147 stations , which probably ensured that Karzai 's final official result for the first round was only slightly lower than the 50 % overall majority he desperately wanted , rather than the result privately calculated by the ECC of 48.3 % .
Meanwhile , US military chiefs plan to present recommendations on troop strength and strategy in Afghanistan to President Barack Obama today , officials said , a sign that the White House 's deliberations may be nearing a conclusion .
The US defence secretary , Robert Gates , and the chairman and vice - chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , Admiral Mike Mullen and General James Cartwright , will be joined at the White House meeting by the top leaders of the army , marine corps , navy and air force .

Amy Goodman interviews Stacie Ritter , whose twin daughters are being denied coverage by CIGNA for the followup care they need from the side - effects of cancer treatment :
STACIE RITTER : Hi .
Thank you , Amy .
Thanks for having me .
AMY GOODMAN : Hi , Stacie .
Tell us your story .
STACIE RITTER :
Well , it ’s a rather long one , so I ’ll try to make it as brief as I can .
Our issues with insurance companies have been going on now for quite a while .
It did n’t start with CIGNA , though , until April Fool ’s Day of 2008 .
That ’s when my husband ’s employer switched insurers to CIGNA , which , again , as far as healthcare is concerned , you do n’t have a choice .
When your employer switches insurers , you get what they give you .
And unfortunately , we were given CIGNA .
My girls are cancer survivors .
They had pituitary and hypothalamus gland damage as a result of chemo and total body radiation to treat their cancer as part of the stem cell transplant that they had when they were four years old .
And a lot of times when a child has that issue , they end up on growth hormone .
Many years later , once the oncologist notices a — like a plateau in their growth , which mine did back in 2005 , so she referred us to an endocrinologist at Children ’s Hospital in Philadelphia , and he monitored them .
And they did n’t start growth hormone until 2007 .
So that was two years of monitoring to make sure , you know , that it was n’t just a little lax in their growth and that it was really a damaged pituitary and hypothalamus .
And once they started the growth hormone under our previous insurer , which was Aetna , they did very , very well .
And so , our doctors said , well , then , that ’s — their positive response to the medication is proof that it was damaged , then , the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland .
So that was great , so we ’ll continue to do this until their bones start to fuse and they no longer need growth hormone .
But unfortunately , CIGNA does not feel the same way that our previous insurer and our world - renowned expert doctor felt .
So they claim to have had two endocrinologists look at our case , and both of their endocrinologists deemed that my girls just suffer from idiopathic short stature , which means short stature of unknown origin .
But quite to the contrary , we know the origin .
We have lots of documentation and proof of the origin .
AMY GOODMAN : And that was — you say that was the radiation that they were exposed to to deal with their rare cancer .
STACIE RITTER : Yes .
And chemotherapies , too , are very toxic , and also depends on the child ’s age at the time , and even the sex has a lot to do with it .
So , the younger the child , especially under five , which mine were — they were four at the time — and the sex — females tend to suffer more damage than males for some reason from the total body radiation .
Not all children with cancer have these kind of late - term effects .
It ’s only children who have had radiation to the brain area , which mine did .
JUAN GONZALEZ : Well , and once CIGNA denied you , how long did the appeals process go on for you to try to get them to reverse the decision ?
And what was happening in between the time that they denied you ?
Did they immediately — were your daughters then not able to get the drug ?
STACIE RITTER :
Well , we were very fortunate to be treated at Children ’s Hospital .
The doctors there know how the insurance companies work .
So when I told them ahead of time that my husband ’s employer was switching insurers , they immediately enrolled us in a program sponsored by the drug company that makes the growth hormone that we ’re using .
And that program is like a bridge program , where they will supply and even have representatives represent me in the appeals process .
So , no , we did n’t have to go without it , thankfully , because my doctors were proactive and knew that the insurance company was going to go through this and deny it and give us the runaround .
Once — it was about three months of dealing with CIGNA .
My doctors called them and did a peer - to - peer , because they were not approving it .
The written information and the medical documents were not enough for CIGNA , so they had a peer - to - peer review scheduled .
And CIGNA even went as far as approving the medication for my one daughter on that peer - to - peer review with our endocrinologist and claiming that it had no knowledge of my other daughter existing .
They had the knowledge that she existed when they sent me the denials for her .
AMY GOODMAN : They ’re identical twins .
STACIE RITTER : Yes , mm-hmm .
AMY GOODMAN : Well , we invited CIGNA to join us on the program , but the company declined our request .
The spokesperson , Chris Curran , issued the following statement , quote , “ There was no laboratory evidence of growth hormone deficiency .
Over a year ago , we had two endocrinologists review this case and based on the laboratory studies , they agreed there is no need for the drug .
This is the first time we are hearing about the family ’s concerns and disagreement with the decision .
We would welcome review of new information as technology and medical evidence is in constant evolution . "
Your response , Stacie Ritter ?
STACIE RITTER :
That ’s a joke .
Actually , I just received — every year we have to re-enroll in this program .
And my doctor had to resubmit a request for coverage to CIGNA again this year .
And we just received this year ’s denial letters from CIGNA on the situation and then had to re-enroll again with the manufacturer .
And that ’s carrying us through then .
So they are very aware of this situation .
They have been .
Unfortunately , our primary endocrinologist who was handling our case had passed away himself of pancreatic cancer last year .
And in the scurry to try to cover all of his patients , you know , all of the doctors there in the endocrinology department have had to divide them up .
So I ’ve had at least four different endocrinologists from CHOP working on my case alone , from writing letters to the peer - to - peer , to the correspondence from the manufacturer , to me calling them .
They ’re very aware of the situation .

Ofcom could be given powers to punish file - sharers
An alliance of music stars , songwriters and record producers has spoken out against UK government proposals to kick file - sharers off the internet .
Persistent file - sharers could have their internet accounts suspended in an attempt to crack down on piracy .
But Radiohead guitarist Ed O'Brien , a member of the Featured Artists ' Coalition ( FAC ) , said : " It 's going to start a war which they 'll never win . "
The FAC said " heavy - handed " tactics may turn fans away from music for good .
The FAC , a pressure group formed to represent performers , has joined forces with the British Academy of Songwriters , Composers and Authors and the Music Producers Guild .
In a joint statement , the three bodies of music - makers said they " vehemently oppose " the plans to punish file - sharers .
That is in contrast to major record labels and many other commercial arms of the music industry , who have welcomed the suggestions .
We do n't want to make enemies of our fans
Dave Rowntree ( right )
Blur Blur drummer Dave Rowntree said the FAC was against file - sharing , but that previous attempts at legal action had turned fans against the music industry and the artists themselves .
" We do n't want to make enemies of our fans , " he told BBC News .
" The sensible thing to do is to try to see how we can monetise all this file - sharing activity , which is evidence of a lot of interest in music . "
It would be very difficult to find out who was swapping files and whether those files contained copyrighted recordings , he warned .
Singer and fellow FAC board member Billy Bragg described the measures as a " very heavy sledgehammer " .
" We 're concerned that , in an age where there is much greater competition for attention , these proposals are in danger of driving young people away from the idea of listening to music , " he said .
" As musicians , we 're worried about that . "
Many young fans had discovered his music through file - sharing , Bragg said , and paid for his music in other ways , such as buying gig tickets .
" We should be encouraging people to become music fans , and whether we like it or not , illicit downloading does encourage people to become music fans . "
There are more positive ways of dealing with this without totally upsetting your consumers
Patrick Rackow
British Academy of Songwriters , Composers and Authors Speaking of the proposal to cut off pirates , Ed O'Brien predicted : " It wo n't work .
It 's as simple as that .
" I was talking to a serial file - sharer the other day , who is a friend .
He downloads films and he has n't paid for music for six years .
" I asked his opinion of it and he laughed .
He said , ' even if they cut me off I 'll still be able to do it ' .
It 's something you do not want to take on , so move on . "
Phonographic Performance Limited , which licenses recorded music and music videos for public performance and broadcast said the majority of its 40,000 members were " not household names " and " they deserve to be protected from theft " .
PPL chairman Fran Nevrkla added : " It is time we had an online world more akin to the High Street than the Wild West . "
His sentiment was echoed by the Creative Coalition Campaign - a partnership between trade unions representing people working in the creative industries .
" Our creative sector produces world - class content , bringing joy to countless people across the UK and the world , but this can't be sustained if illegal file - sharing persists , " said a statement from the coalition .
" There has never been a more critical time to take bold action against those who are threatening the livelihoods of everyone working in the entertainment sector . "
Geoff Taylor , of the British Phonographic Industry , which represents record labels , says the government is right to consider " temporary suspension as a last resort , where accounts are repeatedly used illegally despite warnings " .
" Most people across the music sector recognise the serious damage that illegal file - sharing is doing to investment in new music , " he added .
But Patrick Rackow , chief executive of the British Academy of Songwriters , Composers and Authors , said sanctions would upset fans , rather than driving them towards legal services .
" The industry has to look forwards , not backwards , " he said .
" There is a huge problem here and we 've got to find a solution to it .
I do n't know what this solution is , I do n't think anyone does .
" There are more positive ways of dealing with this without totally upsetting your consumers . "
He suggested that in the future , legal music download services could be based on radio .
In that scenario , fans would not pay for every song but may pay a subscription or hear adverts , as with existing services such as Spotify or We7 .
' Widespread concerns '
In its Digital Britain report , originally published in June , the government set a target to reduce file - sharing by 70 % in the first year .
That report gave media regulator Ofcom until 2012 to consider whether " technical measures " - such as reducing broadband speeds or blocking access to download sites - were necessary .
However , according to a statement from the Department for Business , Innovation and Skills ( BIS ) released last month , that time - frame is now considered " too long to wait " .
Stephen Timms , minister for Digital Britain , said in August : " We 've been listening carefully to responses to the consultation this far , and it 's become clear there are widespread concerns that the plans as they stand could delay action , impacting unfairly upon rights holders . "
Speaking in response to the FAC 's concerns , Mr Timm subsequently added that " any action would follow a clear series of warnings and there would be a fair and effective appeals process " .
UK Music , an umbrella body representing the British music industry , said it was " pleased that government is proposing accelerated and proportionate action to meet their stated ambition of reducing illegal file - sharing " .
" Throughout this debate , UK Music has voiced concerns that the original time - frame of proposed legislation , and particularly the trigger mechanisms that would grant Ofcom reserve powers to implement technical measures , would have failed to meet these ambitions , " a statement said .

Reader Wayne sent us this photograph and explains , " I was walking along and texting .
Not really paying that much attention .
Then something caught my eye .
I thought I was about to step in dog shit , but quickly realized it was a rat stuck in the sidewalk .
A big rat .
It had tried to squeeze through a crack in the sidewalk and failed . "
Update : Another reader created the second photograph in the gallery , adding , " hopefully this makes it a little better ! "
We are still awaiting a reply from Wayne to ask if he tried to help the little guy ( or gal ) out , where it was located and whether we needed to send out a rescue squad .
And if you want to pass the time with some Photoshopped sad rat images ... well , you can send them to tips@gothamist.com and we 'll compile them into a gallery later .
Update 7:50 p.m. :
We 've added some of the rat - in - sidewalk Photoshops — if you 're not doing anything this Friday night , send 'em our way !
Update 10 / 24 : More Photoshopped Sad Rat photographs here , plus a poll asking what you would do if you saw a rat emerging from a sidewalk .
And Wayne got back to our questions .
He says , " It was on my block on the Upper West Side .
82nd Street between CPW and Columbus .
I thought it was alive , but after getting up the nerve to poke it with a ( long ) stick , I realized he was dead .
I did what any wonderful caring masculine New Yorker would do , I told the doorman about it and ran off to work .
That night the sidewalk with spic and span .
I hear the Eulogy was beautiful and moved some to tears . "
I ’ve been developing software for quite a few years .
One of the issues that seems to come up again and again in my work is this concept of design and implementation .
I recall it being a significant part of my education at the University of Waterloo ’s Computer Engineering program as well .
The message was always the same .
Never write code first .
First you must design software by writing a design document , flow charts , pseudo - code , timing charts … then it ’s merely a trivial matter of implementing it .
Make note of the attitude here given towards implementing .
The real work is in the design , and it ’s just a trivial matter of implementing it .
It sounds so simple does n’t it ?
Now , how often does this work out in real life ?
Posing as an American is a ruse used increasingly by Canadian consumers shopping online for products and services not currently available in Canada .
" I think it 's pretty ridiculous .
It should n't be necessary , " said Paul Andersen , a computer consultant who lives in Vancouver .
" I 'm buying a product that should be for sale [ in Canada ] . "
Andersen has set up a U.S. iTunes account so he can get content not available in Canada and has a U.S. iPhone account as well .
Every so often , he drives across the border to buy iTunes gift cards to reload his U.S. account , since it wo n't accept Canadian credit cards .
" It 's a bit of a pain , " he said .
Sean Hawley , who lives in Ottawa , jumps through similar hoops to read electronic books on his iPod Touch .
He set up a U.S. iTunes account and a U.S. account with Amazon.com , complete with an American address , in order to get a Kindle application working .
The usage is still limited , because Hawley would need a U.S. credit card to buy many Amazon titles , but he has enjoyed some of the books Amazon offers for free .
Hawley would prefer to have the physical Kindle , which has been available in the U.S. for more than two years .
It allows users to download books , newspapers and other material anywhere they go .
But it is not sold in Canada and Amazon.com wo n't ship it here .
" I do n't understand why .
There 's no reason why something that 's available in the U.S. is not available here , " said Hawley , who has started an online petition calling for the Kindle to be brought to Canada .
Facilitating this secret cross - border trade are small firms situated along the 49th parallel .
In the North Dakota town of Neche , less than two kilometres south of the Manitoba border , Menke 's Parcel Service will hold packages of goods going north for as little as $ 2 .
It helps Canadian consumers avoid high international shipping costs .
" In the last five years , it 's amazing how much [ business ] has increased , " said owner Snookie Menke .
Canadians use the store for many everyday items such as car parts and appliances as well as U.S. - only tech toys , Menke said .
Pembina Parcel Services , another N.D. company practically on the border , has a website that asks Canadians to " make us your U.S. shipping address . "
Sean Hawley is hopeful that licensing and other agreements will be worked out soon in order to bring the Kindle and other devices to Canada .
But he is worried that Canada will always be a step or two behind countries with larger populations , forcing Canucks to continue to go undercover as Americans .
" Big electronics companies will have stuff released in the U.S. and the U.K. and the bigger markets before it comes to Canada , " he said .
" It makes me feel like we 're always behind . "

As usual the PSP and Nintendo DSi headed the charts , with a reasonable 32 k for the PSP and the DSi miles out in front of everybody .
The full figures are :
Nintendo DSi - 42,199
PSP - 32,865
PlayStation 3 - 29,977
Wii - 25,917
Nintendo DS Lite - 6,550
Xbox 360 - 4,470
PlayStation 2 - 1,951
Things continue to slow down for the Playstation 2 , mind .
Spank me , then let 's do lunch / How many hypocritical Republicans can dance on the head of a sex scandal ?
In my more subdued moments of delighting in the pathos and adulterous whinings of incalculable greasy right - wing politicians , I oft wonder at the threshold , the limit , if there is some sort of karmic boundary that will eventually snap and recoil and strike them all down on the spot , some sort of grand tsunami of wayward justice that will sweep them all to the great Thai brothel in the sky after one too many gay lovers , meth addictions , adulterous affairs , teen boy fetishes comes to light and the world says , you know what ?
Enough of you .
Back to the primordial slop you go .
It 's a fantasy , I know , and an unrealistic one at that , given how there appears to be no mechanism in the reptilian political mind to allow for nuance , no space for notions of responsibility and consequence .
It simply does n't exist .
Really , half the GOP congressman in Washington could admit to a gay affair and the other half to snorting blow off the tailbone of a needy lobbyist / hooker / intern in front of a church on Sunday , and still the party leadership would say , gosh , that 's too bad , what a shame , let us now respect the privacy of the families involved at this difficult time and leave them alone and hey by the way , Obama is a socialist tyrant who wants to indoctrinate your babies .
Fear him !
So it is we observe the end of the puny political career of California state assemblyman Mike Duvall , R - Riverside County ( AKA the dystopian wasteland of Orange County , to you and me ) , the classic chubby , glad - handing political slug if ever , boasting to a colleague of his rather gross sexual exploits with not one , but two different mistresses -- one allegedly a lobbyist with whom Duvall did regular state business -- on a live microphone he thought was turned off .
Ah , technology , will you ever cease to bless us with your copious gifts ?
The reaction to Duvall 's recorded slop ?
Pretty much one giant shrug .
Sure , he resigned immediately for causing a " distraction . "
Sure , everyone expressed their pseudo - shock and said the right things about investigations and repercussions and tsk tsk tsk .
But even his colleagues stopped short of outright condemnation .
And no one anywhere was really the slightest bit surprised by any of it .
The truly astonishing thing is how such revelations do n't ooze to the surface every single day .
Who by now does n't see the massive hypocrisy in so many of GOP positions ?
Who by now has n't seen the miles - long list of " ethics - based " Republicans who have gladly stuck their fingers into the socket of any power skirt who walks by ?
Another day , another " family values " Republican praised for his ethical fortitude but who 's really about as moral as a cobra at a Mouseketeers reunion .
Of course , in your more cynical and wary heart , you know it 's not just the Republicans .
Such ' scandal ' is merely SOP for Washington , sex and sleaze and hooking up pretty much the name of the game no matter your gender or party affiliation ; politicos nailing lobbyists , senators nailing interns , aides nailing publicists , the corridors of power from the mayor 's office all the way up to the Big House simply reeking with used condoms and grainy hidden videos and a thousand tubby Mike Duvalls spanking a thousand gold - digging lobbyists who have , it must be said , rather repulsive taste in men .
To imagine Washington as somehow slightly more pure or principled than , say , your average Midwestern frat house during Beer Bong Week is not merely naive , it 's downright ignorant .
Maybe the real question is why we insist on believing our elected officials are somehow more immune , more upright and just .
Is it simply that we like to imagine we 're being led by people slightly more thoughtful and wise than ourselves ?
Willful ignorance , thy name is America .
Of course , it 's not merely our doing .
The GOP squeezes its own thick layer of hypocrisy over the entire political landscape , making the stink that much more rancid and profound .
You do n't find many Dems wailing about the need to lock up the homosexuals out of one side of their mouth , while delivering blowjobs to their gay lover with the other .
To many keeping score , it ain't really about the deeds themselves ; it 's all about the hypocrisy .
As the AP reported , Duvall " had received a 100 percent rating from Capitol Resource Institute , a conservative advocacy group , for his votes on legislation considered pro-family during the 2007 - 08 legislative session . "
How sweet .
And also , you know , repulsive .
It doth bring forth the question , once again and for the millionth time :
What does it take ?
How many politicos must openly mock and betray and spit all over their BS family values shtick before anyone learns anything , before a shift transpires , before a majority of the GOP wakes up and says , " Oh my God , you know what ?
We 've been going about this all wrong . "
You already know the answer .
The number is infinite .
There is no threshold , there is no boundary , because that 's simply not how it works .
To the GOP , Duvall and his ilk are just more sinners in need of correction and forgiveness , not actually another slimy example of a failed and unfeasible ideology .
It 's directly akin to any sort of religious fundamentalist or Bible literalists :
There are no failed platforms , only failed followers .
There is nothing wrong with the core idea , no matter how childish or untenable it may be .
There are only flawed humans , unable to keep their pants on , their desires in check , their ids sealed in concrete .
Guilt and shame forever and ever , amen .
So we merely pause for a hiccup of time , and bid farewell to another minor Republican whose name you will forget roughly 36 hours from now , whose lecherous , archetypal deeds will hereby be added the Great Book of Conservative / Religious Hypocrisy and Pitiable Obviousness , a tome far more reliable than any political platform , far larger and more timeless than any Bible .
Duvall 's trifling tale will be entered in as yet another of those entirely forgettable , slightly nauseating footnotes , full of spank and sleaze , signifying nothing .

Academy Award- , WGA - , and BAFTA - nominated A History of Violence screenwriter Josh Olson has an interesting screed in this week ’s Village Voice :
​ I will not read your fucking script .
That ’s simple enough , is n’t it ?
“ I will not read your fucking script . ”
What ’s not clear about that ?
There ’s nothing personal about it , nothing loaded , nothing complicated .
I simply have no interest in reading your fucking screenplay .
None whatsoever .
If that seems unfair , I ’ll make you a deal .
In return for you not asking me to read your fucking script , I will not ask you to wash my fucking car , or take my fucking picture , or represent me in fucking court , or take out my fucking gall bladder , or whatever the fuck it is that you do for a living .
You ’re a lovely person .
Whatever time we ’ve spent together has , I ’m sure , been pleasurable for both of us .
I quite enjoyed that conversation we once had about structure and theme , and why Sergio Leone is the greatest director who ever lived .
Yes , we bonded , and yes , I wish you luck in all your endeavors , and it would thrill me no end to hear that you had sold your screenplay , and that it had been made into the best movie since Godfather Part II .
But I will not read your fucking script .
At this point , you should walk away , firm in your conviction that I ’m a dick .
But if you ’re interested in growing as a human being and recognizing that it is , in fact , you who is the dick in this situation , please read on .
Yes .
That ’s right .
I called you a dick .
Because you created this situation .
You put me in this spot where my only option is to acquiesce to your demands or be the bad guy .
That , my friend , is the very definition of a dick move .
I was recently cornered by a young man of my barest acquaintance .
I doubt we ’ve exchanged a hundred words .
But he ’s dating someone I know , and he cornered me in the right place at the right time , and asked me to read a two - page synopsis for a script he ’d been working on for the last year .
He was submitting the synopsis to some contest or program , and wanted to get a professional opinion .
Now , I normally have a standard response to people who ask me to read their scripts , and it ’s the simple truth : I have two piles next to my bed .
One is scripts from good friends , and the other is manuscripts and books and scripts my agents have sent to me that I have to read for work .
Every time I pick up a friend ’s script , I feel guilty that I ’m ignoring work .
Every time I pick something up from the other pile , I feel guilty that I ’m ignoring my friends .
If I read yours before any of that , I ’d be an awful person .
Most people get that .
But sometimes you find yourself in a situation where the guilt factor is really high , or someone plays on a relationship or a perceived obligation , and it ’s hard to escape without seeming rude .
Then , I tell them I ’ll read it , but if I can put it down after ten pages , I will .
They always go for that , because nobody ever believes you can put their script down once you start .
But hell , this was a two page synopsis , and there was no time to go into either song or dance , and it was just easier to take it .
How long can two pages take ?
Weeks , is the answer .
And this is why I will not read your fucking script .
It rarely takes more than a page to recognize that you ’re in the presence of someone who can write , but it only takes a sentence to know you ’re dealing with someone who can’t .
( By the way , here ’s a simple way to find out if you ’re a writer .
If you disagree with that statement , you ’re not a writer .
Because , you see , writers are also readers . )
You may want to allow for the fact that this fellow had never written a synopsis before , but that does n’t excuse the inability to form a decent sentence , or an utter lack of facility with language and structure .
The story described was clearly of great importance to him , but he had done nothing to convey its specifics to an impartial reader .
What I was handed was , essentially , a barely coherent list of events , some connected , some not so much .
Characters wander around aimlessly , do things for no reason , vanish , reappear , get arrested for unnamed crimes , and make wild , life - altering decisions for no reason .
Half a paragraph is devoted to describing the smell and texture of a piece of food , but the climactic central event of the film is glossed over in a sentence .
The death of the hero is not even mentioned .
One sentence describes a scene he ’s in , the next describes people showing up at his funeral .
I could go on , but I wo n’t .
This is the sort of thing that would earn you a D minus in any Freshman Comp class .
Which brings us to an ugly truth about many aspiring screenwriters :
They think that screenwriting does n’t actually require the ability to write , just the ability to come up with a cool story that would make a cool movie .
Screenwriting is widely regarded as the easiest way to break into the movie business , because it does n’t require any kind of training , skill or equipment .
Everybody can write , right ?
And because they believe that , they do n’t regard working screenwriters with any kind of real respect .
They will hand you a piece of inept writing without a second thought , because you do not have to be a writer to be a screenwriter .
So .
I read the thing .
And it hurt , man .
It really hurt .
I was dying to find something positive to say , and there was nothing .
And the truth is , saying something positive about this thing would be the nastiest , meanest and most dishonest thing I could do .
Because here ’s the thing : not only is it cruel to encourage the hopeless , but you cannot discourage a writer .
If someone can talk you out of being a writer , you ’re not a writer .
If I can talk you out of being a writer , I ’ve done you a favor , because now you ’ll be free to pursue your real talent , whatever that may be .
And , for the record , everybody has one .
The lucky ones figure out what that is .
The unlucky ones keep on writing shitty screenplays and asking me to read them .
To make matters worse , this guy ( and his girlfriend ) had begged me to be honest with him .
He was frustrated by the responses he ’d gotten from friends , because he felt they were going easy on him , and he wanted real criticism .
They never do , of course .
What they want is a few tough notes to give the illusion of honesty , and then some pats on the head .
What they want–always–is encouragement , even when they should n’t get any .
Do you have any idea how hard it is to tell someone that they ’ve spent a year wasting their time ?
Do you know how much blood and sweat goes into that criticism ?
Because you want to tell the truth , but you want to make absolutely certain that it comes across honestly and without cruelty .
I did more rewrites on that fucking e-mail than I did on my last three studio projects .
My first draft was ridiculous .
I started with specific notes , and after a while , found I ’d written three pages on the first two paragraphs .
That was n’t the right approach .
So I tossed it , and by the time I was done , I ’d come up with something that was relatively brief , to the point , and considerate as hell .
The main point I made was that he ’d fallen prey to a fallacy that nails a lot of first timers .
He was way more interested in telling his one story than in being a writer .
It was like buying all the parts to a car and starting to build it before learning the basics of auto mechanics .
You ’ll learn a lot along the way , I said , but you ’ll never have a car that runs .
( I should mention that while I was composing my response , he pulled the ultimate amateur move , and sent me an e-mail saying , “ If you have n’t read it yet , do n’t !
I have a new draft .
Read this ! ”
In other words , “ The draft I told you was ready for professional input , was n’t actually . ” )
I advised him that if all he was interested in was this story , he should find a writer and work with him ; or , if he really wanted to be a writer , start at the beginning and take some classes , and start studying seriously .
And you know what ?
I should n’t have bothered .
Because for all the hair I pulled out , for all the weight and seriousness I gave his request for a real , professional critique , his response was a terse “ Thanks for your opinion . ”
And , the inevitable fallout–a week later a mutual friend asked me , “ What ’s this dick move I hear you pulled on Whatsisname ? ”
So now this guy and his girlfriend think I ’m an asshole , and the truth of the matter is , the story really ended the moment he handed me the goddamn synopsis .
Because if I ’d just said “ No ” then and there , they ’d still think I ’m an asshole .
Only difference is , I would n’t have had to spend all that time trying to communicate thoughtfully and honestly with someone who just wanted a pat on the head , and , more importantly , I would n’t have had to read that godawful piece of shit .
You are not owed a read from a professional , even if you think you have an in , and even if you think it ’s not a huge imposition .
It ’s not your choice to make .
This needs to be clear–when you ask a professional for their take on your material , you ’re not just asking them to take an hour or two out of their life , you ’re asking them to give you–gratis–the acquired knowledge , insight , and skill of years of work .
It is no different than asking your friend the house painter to paint your living room during his off hours .
There ’s a great story about Pablo Picasso .
Some guy told Picasso he ’d pay him to draw a picture on a napkin .
Picasso whipped out a pen and banged out a sketch , handed it to the guy , and said , “ One million dollars , please . ”
“ A million dollars ? ” the guy exclaimed .
“ That only took you thirty seconds ! ”
“ Yes , ” said Picasso .
“ But it took me fifty years to learn how to draw that in thirty seconds . ”
Like the cad who asks the professional for a free read , the guy simply did n’t have enough respect for the artist to think about what he was asking for .
If you think it ’s only about the time , then ask one of your non-writer friends to read it .
Hell , they might even enjoy your script .
They might look upon you with a newfound respect .
It could even come to pass that they call up a friend in the movie business and help you sell it , and soon , all your dreams will come true .
But me ?
I will not read your fucking script .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 249 points on Friday was a significant turning point in this rally because it came on the back of a 200 point jump just the subsequent day .
On Thursday the GDP numbers were released showing a strong 3.5 percent jump .
Yet digging into the data , 1.6 percent of this growth was based on front loading auto sales ( the 30 year average for the auto sector each quarter is between .1 and .2 percent ) and massive government spending .
Yet that is what stimulus is for .
On Friday however , consumer spending and income fell leading to the reality that without the government , the average American is tapped out and is unable to juice up those credit cards anymore .
Let us first take a look at the biggest down days for the Dow since the rally started in early March :
This was the biggest drop since April of 2009 .
That is significant .
It took us nearly six months to have a down day of over 249 points .
And if you really think about it , the news was n’t all that bad .
In fact , the GDP numbers should have kept things going .
But again , the reality is setting in that there will be no V - shaped recovery and 27 million unemployed and underemployed Americans benefit little from the current stock market rally .
Most do n’t get their monthly money from the stock market but an actual W - 2 job .
This rally has also seen a significant number of up days :
Since the rally , we have yet to see a 300 point down day .
We have seen a nearly 500 point gain right after the low point was reached in early March and a 379 point rally the next day .
So nearly 900 points were made up in two days off the low bounce .
The Dow peaked in this rally at 10,081 and we currently stand at 9,712 .
It will be interesting to see what happens next week with the BLS job report coming out .
The market expects a 9.9 percent official rate but there is a strong possibility of going over 10 percent .
You can expect a 10 percent unemployment rate to psychologically change the feel of the market .
Hard to believe in a rally when the unemployment rate ( official ) is at 10 percent .
Yet even now , we hear more and more people using the U - 6 rate in official figures and that is already at 17 percent .
What we saw on Friday is a real true test of this rally .
Is this for real or simply a juicing of the markets by Wall Street and the government ?
The figures coming out on Friday are starting to believe this rally is simply based on fumes .
An adrenaline shot from the government and Wall Street wo n’t sustain an economy since many average Americans are already tapped out on spending .
Notice how you are receiving less and less of those credit card offers in the mail ?
There is a reason for this :
Source : Paul Kedrosky
Direct mail credit card offers peaked in Q3 of 2006 with approximately 2.1 billion being sent out .
In Q3 of 2009 only 391 million have been sent out .
In other words , credit card companies definitely do n’t believe in the recovery and they certainly do n’t believe in the American consumer .
On top of this drop , credit card companies are now jacking up fees on good standing customers , adding annual fees for inactivity , and basically acting like your local loan shark .
At times they are even charging 79.99 percent interest rates that would make Tony Soprano blush .
If we really look at the data , the economy is doing anything but recovering .
Actually , it is recovering but for those on Wall Street and the banks .
The average American is merely subsidizing their party .
By the way , the banks are largely the reason for the decade long housing bubble .
If you really want to see how much insiders believe in this rally , let us look at some details from last week .
Insiders for the week with data from Thomson Reuters bought 8.2 million dollars worth of stock during last week .
How much was sold ?
184 million dollars .
This pattern has been occurring the entire rally .
Now would n’t you think insiders would have a better sense of the true nature of this economic recovery ?
Next week will be important and the jobs report number may go over 10 percent because many people hearing this good news , are now back looking for work but very few jobs are out there .
In other words , they will move from the shadows of the 2 million workers that have given up into the actual official pool .

CAKE !
In the comments on a previous post , reader Leah made a wonderful and simple suggestion : “ Cake ! ! ”
I just so happened to have some Mississippi Mud Pie lying around .
But what is the best way to get its chocolatey nutty mocha-ey flavour into coffee ?
Well , I ’ve never been a fan of subtlety , so I just dropped the whole damn thing in .
Add some cream and sugar .
Then supercharge that mocha flavour with some coffee .
And blend the heck out of it .
The thing I immediately noticed about the finished product was that it looked like a foamy fancy drink , and smelled delicious .
The taste was good , but not as sweet or as bold as I thought it would be .
It was like a mild hot chocolate .
Obviously the mocha flavour , which stands out in the cake on its own , was all but absent in a drink that ’s 3/4 coffee .
I ’ve done some undocumented experiments with nuts before , and found that whole nuts ( vs. nut butter ) give coffee a gritty texture without the subtle nutty flavour I desired .
The candied pecans here were no exception , even though there were n’t many .
I was surprised that the rest of the cake blended smoothly into the coffee , though , leaving only some nut bits at the bottom .
Overall , it was good , but for all the calories I ’d rather just make a nice café mocha .
I gotta try this with other cakes .
I bet vanilla birthday cake with lots of icing would be delicious .
Starting this fall , you 'll have a new reason to trust the information you find on Wikipedia :
An optional feature called " WikiTrust " will color code every word of the encyclopedia based on the reliability of its author and the length of time it has persisted on the page .
More than 60 million people visit the free , open - access encyclopedia each month , searching for knowledge on 12 million pages in 260 languages .
But despite its popularity , Wikipedia has long suffered criticism from those who say it 's not reliable .
Because anyone with an internet connection can contribute , the site is subject to vandalism , bias and misinformation .
And edits are anonymous , so there 's no easy way to separate credible information from fake content created by vandals .
Now , researchers from the Wiki Lab at the University of California , Santa Cruz have created a system__ __to help users know when to trust Wikipedia — and when to reach for that dusty Encyclopedia Britannica on the shelf .
Called WikiTrust , the program assigns a color code to newly edited text using an algorithm that calculates author reputation from the lifespan of their past contributions .
It ’s based on a simple concept :
The longer information persists on the page , the more accurate it 's likely to be .
Text from questionable sources starts out with a bright orange background , while text from trusted authors gets a lighter shade .
As more people view and edit the new text , it gradually gains more " trust " and turns from orange to white .
" They ’ve hit on the fundamentally Darwinian nature of Wikipedia , ” said Wikipedia software developer and neuroscientist Virgil Griffith of the California Institute of Technology , who was not involved in the project .
“ Everyone ’s injecting random crap into Wikipedia , and what people agree with more often sticks around .
Crap that people do n’t like goes away . ”
WikiTrust has been available as a MediaWiki extension since November 2008 , meaning that anyone who runs a wiki site has been free to download the code and add the feature to their site .
Now , the WikiMedia Foundation , the non-profit organization that manages Wikipedia , has decided to demo the WikiTrust feature on the entire encyclopedia , according to Jay Walsh , head of communications .
Registered Wikipedia users will be able to click on a " trust info " tab and view the color - coded text , and the researchers expect the gadget to be ready sometime this fall .
" Online collaboration is becoming more and more central to the way in which knowledge is created and assembled worldwide , " said computer scientist Luca de Alfaro , who runs the UCSC Wiki Lab and led the WikiTrust project .
" There are more and more services that simply cannot exist without some notion of user reputation and trust in the content . "
De Alfaro first came up with the idea for a wiki reputation system when he became frustrated with the amount of vandalism on his own wiki site .
“ I started to think there has to be some way to give people an incentive to behave in a more productive way , ” he said .
Collaborative websites such as Amazon.com and eBay already have reputation systems based on user ratings .
Many people proposed creating a similar system for Wikipedia , but de Alfaro feared that user - generated ratings might upset Wikipedia ’s collaborative atmosphere .
He also did n’t want to create more work for editors .
“ If something works as well as Wikipedia , ” de Alfaro said , “ you think very hard before proposing to modify it in such a way that everybody has to give comments on everybody else . ”
Since Wikipedia already keeps track of every revision , de Alfaro realized he could use that data to create a reputation system independent of human input .
“ Machines should work for humans and not the other way around , ” he said .
“ So if you can get information without bothering people , via clever algorithms , this is much better . ”
The Wiki Lab built its trust tool around the principle that Wikipedia pages tend to improve over time , or at least to move toward consensus .
You can measure an author ’s trustworthiness by looking at how long his or her edits persist over time , said UCSC graduate student Bo Adler , who developed WikiTrust with de Alfaro and graduate student Ian Pye .
“ When you add something to Wikipedia and it lasts a long time , you did a good job , ” Adler said .
“ If it gets erased right away , you did a bad job . ”
Based on an person ’s past contributions , WikiTrust computes a reputation score between zero and nine .
When someone makes an edit , the background behind the new text gets shaded orange depending on their reputation : the brighter the orange , the less “ trust ” the text has .
Then when another author edits the page , they essentially vote on the new text .
If they like the edit , they ’ll keep it , and if not , they ’ll revert it .
Text that persists will become less orange over time , as more editors give their votes of approval .
“ We try to predict when things are going to be deleted , ” Adler said .
“ We want words that are going to be deleted to have a low trust , and words that are not going to be deleted to have a high trust . ”
But some critics think there may be hurdles to running the trust tool over the entire site .
“ This is n't a trivial web architecture design and implementation issue , ” said computer scientist Ed Chi of the Palo Alto Research Group , who studies Wikipedia and social cognition .
Since WikiTrust assigns a reputation score to every word in every article , running the program in real time will demand significant processing power and several terabytes of extra disk space .
But Wiki Lab researchers say they 're already working on making the program more efficient .
Using the first version of WikiTrust , it took a regular computer 20 days to process five years of Wikipedia revision data .
The latest edition cuts that time to four days , and it can calculate trust ratings for 30 to 40 revisions per second .
“ That ’s on a single machine , ” Adler said .
“ So it ’s very practical for us to keep up with Wikipedia . ”
In addition , because the product has n't been tested in large numbers of real users , Chi said he 's not convinced that users will find it helpful .
Although his reasearch group had similar ideas for a reputation system in Wikipedia , Chi said they decided not to pursue the iea .
" I was n't sure how well it really would work with ordinary users , in terms of their increased ability to detect trust problems and its interference with actual reading tasks , " he said .
The Wiki Lab researchers also worried about their product detracting from the Wikipedia experience , so they designed it to be as unobtrusive as possible .
Because too much orange text would turn people off , they balanced the need to flag questionable text with the need to keep the page readable .
They also hid the gadget in a tab at the top of the screen , so if you do n’t want to bother with trust ratings , you do n’t have to click on the “ trust info ” tab .
And do n’t go hunting for your own orange ratings :
The team decided not to display user reputation to avoid discouraging new users .
“ Even if you ’re a wonderful biologist , ” de Alfaro said , “ if you have n’t written very much at all on Wikipedia , your reputation will be low . ”
WikiTrust can detect most types of questionable content .
But when asked whether his gadget measures " truth " on Wikipedia , de Alfaro hesitated .
WikiTrust determines trustworthiness based on how many people agree with a particular passage of text , he said , but majority approval does n’t guarantee truth .
“ If 20 people are all biased in one way , our tool does not know it , ” de Alfaro said .
“ Our tool can simply measure consensus . ”
Adler offers a hypothetical example .
“ What if Wikipedia was dominated by Nazis ? ” he said .
“ Whatever you say about the Holocaust , they ’re going to revert you , and then other people are going to come and support those edits rather than your edits . ”
In that case , WikiTrust would start flagging your Holocaust content as unreliable — no matter how accurate it was .
Trial by consensus sounds sketchy , but majority opinion has nearly always dictated society 's definition of truth .
A 15th century encyclopedia would have insisted that the sun revolves around the earth .
The 1911 edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica asserted that bacteria causes the flu , since viruses had n’t been discovered yet .
So perhaps it ’s not a question of whether to trust consensus .
Rather , whose consensus do you want to trust : a handful of experts , or thousands of anonymous internet users and a clever computer algorithm ?
UPDATE : At the time of publication , the WikiMedia Foundation had confirmed with us that they planned to demo WikiTrust , but could not be reached for further comment .
Now they have contacted us and wish to add the following statement , emphasizing that the WikiTrust extension will be optional , and like all additions to Wikipedia , will undergo a community process of testing and evaluation .
Here is what they have to say :
" WikiTrust is one of thousands of extensions available within the MediaWiki library .
As with other extensions , including flagged revisions , which has been the subject of quite a bit of attention over the past few weeks , extensions are tested and evaluated by members of the volunteer community before being implemented on any of the Foundation 's projects , including Wikipedia .
Many of these extensions are part of ongoing research by outside developers and volunteers who want to look at ways of improving the quality of content on Wikipedia and other wikis using MediaWiki .
When WikiTrust makes its way through testing and analysis it may be made available as an optional tool that Wikipedia users can activate through their user settings .
That timeframe has still not been set .
The Foundation is also looking at introducing a number of visible trust / quality metric tools , which may include tools familiar to many users , including ' rate this article ' tools on Wikipedia pages .
These enhancements would be introduced in the spirit of letting readers and editors better understand which articles , facts , or edits need to be reviewed for quality and accuracy . "

Davina and Jasmine were killed with a kitchen knife A mother who murdered her two daughters as they slept has been jailed for life and must serve a minimum of 33 years .
Rekha Kumari-Baker , 41 , stabbed 16 - year - old Davina 37 times and 13 - year - old Jasmine 29 times at their home in Stretham , Cambridgeshire .
Her ex-husband said the killings were " an act of calculated viciousness " .
The 33 - year minimum sentence handed down at Cambridge Crown Court is one of the longest jail terms given to a woman in the UK in modern times .
David Baker , Kumari - Baker 's ex-husband , said he had been " robbed " of his daughters .
' Mystery motive ' Kumari - Baker admitted killing the girls in June 2007 but denied murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility .
However the jury did not believe her and took just 35 minutes to find her guilty of murder .

Sentencing her , Mr Justice Bean said the Parole Board would not consider her for release until 2040 , when she will be 72 .
He said she had been found guilty of two brutal murders on the basis of " clear and compelling evidence " .
" Most people will find it inexplicable that a mother could kill her own children and you have given no explanation for it , " he said .
He said she was " certainly upset " at the breakdown of her relationship with boyfriend Jeff Powell .
He added : " I think mild depression was probably combined with a wish to retaliate against David Baker and destroy the happiness in his life but to some extent your motive remains a mystery .
" Your defence of diminished responsibility was flimsy and unsubstantial .
You knew quite well what you were doing and you were not mentally ill . "
JAIL TERMS FOR WOMEN Rekha Kumari - Baker 's 33 - year minimum sentence - or ' tariff ' - is among the longest handed by a UK court to a woman in modern times .
Others include : Rose West : Sentenced in 1995 for killing 10 young women and girls over 20 years - ' whole life ' tariff Beverley Allitt : Nurse who killed four children in 1991 - given minimum 30 - year tariff Myra Hindley : Moors murderer jailed for life in 1966 .
Minimum term increased by home secretaries during her time in jail to ' whole life ' .
Died 2002
The judge considered whether Kumari - Baker should ever be considered for release but concluded that the premeditation was significant but not substantial so a " whole life order " was not warranted .
In a victim impact statement read to the court by prosecutor John Farmer after Kumari - Baker was convicted , Mr Baker told of the " incalculable " loss he had suffered .
" Having them taken away from me in such a brutal way and by the woman who was their mother ... has had an incalculable effect , " Mr Baker said in his statement .
" I am haunted by the horror of the events of that night and probably will remain so for a very long time . "
His statement continued : " She tore them from us all and life can't be the same for those who remain . "
Prosecutors had said Kumari - Baker was trying to " wreak havoc " on her ex-husband .
Asda knives
During the two - week trial , jurors heard that she attacked the girls in the early hours of 13 June .
The court heard evidence showed that Davina - whose body was found kneeling on the floor - had struggled .
Jasmine was found dead in bed .
The prosecution said Kumari - Baker bought the knives she used to attack the girls at an Asda supermarket two days earlier .
She argued that she had been suffering from a mental disorder and mounted a " diminished responsibility defence " .

The Daily Mail recently made waves with a photo exposing what it called the " ghost fleet of the recession " where hundreds of ships were shown on anchor off the straits of Singapore , doing nothing except rusting : a tribute to the unprecedented collapse in world trade , the bulk of which is seaborne , and the huge amount of excess slack in shipping .
Zero Hedge decided to probe this idea further , and for that we took advantage of the very useful real time ship tracker functionality provided by vesseltracker.com ( any reader who has Google Earth can easily replicate these results using the following data file ) .
The results
First we wanted to show how traditionally functioning critical routes are still heavily trafficked , as can be seen by the large amount of green highlights in the following snapshots ( green indicates operating ship , red denotes a ship out of spot / charter and currently unused ) .
Gibraltar :
Denmark :
Red Sea ( one hopes the Somali pirates do not have access to Vesseltracker ) :
Yet where it gets interesting is when one scours for comparable packets of inactivity as that captured by the Daily Mail .
As a first example of just how bad it really is , we recreate the image of the Singapore Strait that is shown on the picture at the top :
What is surprising is how prevalent this pattern is around the globe .
Some comparable areas we discovered were the following :
Coast of Britain :
Qinhungdao ( Chinese coast ) - note the pattern that allows any active ships to actually enter the harbor .
This is probably not a good indication of the Baltic Dry Index to going up any time soon .
Putuo - another representation of Chinese overzealousness in building drybulkers :
Belgian coast :
Dubai : the gateway to the middle east is essentially closed .
All that expensive oil , and nobody is transporting it ... At least if you look closely you can see some very nice man made islands , that are the only remnants of the great Dubai experiment in recreating the US credit / real estate bubble :
Most shocking is the situation around the Bosporus : the transit corridor between Russia and the rest of the world is orders of magnitude worse than even the Singapore case .
As for our own back yard , this is the situation in the Gulf of Mexico : a sea of red .
One wonders how many of these ships are merely filled with crude , happily waiting for oil to hit $ 145 one more time .
The bottom line : world trade has collapsed , shipping lines , once flourishing , have become graveyard archipelagos populated by rusting ship skeletons .
Yet all of this is beyond the land , and thus far from sight .
Of course , who needs trade when you have a speculative market trading in its own bubble , hitting yearly highs day after day , thanks only and exclusively to the Chairman 's printing press .
It is a pity these ships can not sail in the sea of hundred dollar bills that is being created each and every day at the Federal Reserve , whose only use these days it seems is to buy junker stocks and to feed the algos that lift whatever offers are stupid enough to float in the equity market .
Dogs might be able to stay warmer in the winter than us humans , but there are limits to what most dogs can tolerate .
There are huskies in Alaska that can tolerate very cold temperatures and they know how to keep themselves warm .
Most dog owners have domesticated dogs that would n’t do very well at the Iditarod .
Here are some things you can do to protect your dog during the winter .
· Watch for anything that melts snow and ice .
When you take your dog for a walk they can step in all kinds of things .
There is rock salt and rock salt with added chemicals .
There is dripping anti-freeze in the garage .
There is also something fairly new they put on the roads to keep the water from freezing .
It is called mag - chloride , and is a liquid sprayed on the roads .
I do n’t know all of the ingredients in this , but I do know it can mess up the paint on some cars and is said to corrode power lines .
When you get home and park in the driveway or garage , this mag - chloride will drip off the car .
Your dog can walk in this and get it on their paws .
When your dog goes back in the house and lies down , they can lick their paws , ingesting these toxic chemicals .
You should wipe off their paws when you get back in the house just to make sure there is n’t anything on their paws .
· Pay attention to where you put your bottles of anti-freeze .
Dogs like the taste of anti-freeze and if you forget and leave it low enough , there is a chance your dog could lick the bottle .
Cars can also leak anti-freeze onto the garage floor , make sure your dog does n't lick that .
· Do not keep your dog out all night long , or all day long with cold temperatures thinking that a doghouse will keep them nice and warm .
And do n’t forget about the wind chill .
Wind chill is what the temperature actually feels like on skin and drives down the body temperature , which can cause frostbite .
An air temperature of 0 F ( - 18 C ) and a wind of 20 mph ( 32 km /h ) will cause a wind chill temperature of – 22 F ( - 30 C ) .
I once had a neighbor who kept his dogs out all night no matter what the temperature was .
When it was below zero I would hear the dogs howling occasionally , which made for a hard time sleeping , knowing the dogs were probably freezing cold .

· When you let your dog go out to " go " , watch them carefully if it ’s cold and there is snow on the ground .
The dog ’s paws can freeze , making it hard for them to walk .
Watch your dog and make sure they do n’t start limping or act as if they are having a hard time walking .
And if your dog decides to just lie down out of the blue , that is a good sign they cannot walk at that moment .
Numerous times over the years I have had to carry the dog back to the patio .
The dog goes out from a nice warm house with hot paws and walking in the snow with bitter temperatures causes the snow to melt and refreeze on their paws .
Make sure you wear gloves or you could get frosbite .
· When you go for a walk on a nice winter day around the lake at the park , do not let your dog off the leash where they might go chasing the geese on the ice and fall through the ice .
There are always stories of rescues of dogs falling through the ice .
Dogs can swim well , but that cold water will cause them to freeze just like humans falling through the ice .
I ca n’t count the number of times I have seen people just let their dogs run out onto the ice of a lake in the park , knowing that ice is n’t thick enough .

· Just like in the summer , do n’t keep your dog in the car unless you can watch your car at all times .
Cars get cold fast in the winter , and people do steal dogs out of cars .
· One last tip that can make your dog ’s life easier during the winter : when the snow gets fairly deep , depending on the size of your dog , you can help your dog by digging a path and a spot in your dog ’s favorite spot in the yard .
Also make sure your dog's water dish has fresh water and is n't a frozen block of ice .
Keeping these safety tips in mind during the winter will help your dog stay healthy , happy and safe .

I am strongly opposed to questions of the type “ which is the odd one out ” during IQ tests .
On the other hand , I do not mind them in different settings , especially when they are fun .
Inspired by Martin Gardner , I spent a lot of time drawing this picture , and now I have to share it with the world .
So , which is the odd one out ?
Share :
Profiling with stream fusion
As we move on to bigger examples in DPH , identifying performance problems just by staring at the Core output becomes somewhat difficult .
We ’ve finally reached a point where we actually have to profile DPH programs and identify slow loops .
But how ?
Cost centre profiling is n’t supported by the vectoriser and in any case , it works on the Haskell source whereas we are interested in loops generated by the vectoriser .
Ticky - ticky profiling happens a bit too late , when all those loops have been transformed into something mostly unrecognisable .
It also seems to have problems with - threaded .
Looks like we have to implement it ourselves …
With a bit of thought , this turns out to be surprisingly easy .
Since DPH uses stream fusion , ( almost ) all those loops operate on streams .
Now , the basic idea is to annotate all streams with a string which tells us how the stream has been produced .
data Stream a = forall s. Stream ... String replicateS :: Int -> a ->
Stream a replicateS n x = Stream ... " replicateS " mapS :: ( a -> b ) ->
Stream a ->
Stream b mapS f ( Stream ... c ) = Stream ... ( " mapS <- " ++ c )
and so on .
Now , when a real loop consumes a stream it simply logs its running time together with the stream ’s producer :
unstreamU :: Stream a ->
UArr a unstreamU ( Stream ... c ) = runST ( traceLoopST ( " unstreamU <- " ++ c ) $ fill ) where fill =
Since streams are purely compile - time structures and no streams should be left in the program if the simplifier is doing its job properly , all those strings simply go away if we compile our library without tracing ( i.e. , make traceLoopST a noop ) .
With tracing on , however , our rather fancy implementation actually produces dtrace events at the beginning and at the end of a loop .
This is a very flexible mechanism .
In particular , it allows us to produce profiles like this ( pardon my formatting ) :
... unstreamMU <- zipWithS <- ( zipWithS <- ( zipWithS <- ( replicateEachS <- zipWithS <- ( streamU , streamU ) , streamU ) , zipWithS <- ( replicateEachS <- zipWithS <- ( streamU , streamU ) , streamU ) ) , zipWithS <- ( zipWithS <- ( replicateEachS <- zipWithS <- ( streamU , st 12115903 unstreamMU <- mapS <- mapS <- streamU 21787693 foldS <- streamU 27096786 unstreamMU <- zipWithS <- ( streamU , mapS <- fold1SS <- ( streamU , zipWithS <- ( enumFromToEachS <- zipWithS <- ( replicateS , mapS <- streamU ) , streamU ) ) ) 60756439 unstreamMU <- toStream 817568512
This shows the raw running time for each kind of stream loop in the program .
Of course , it does n’t distinguish between different instantiations of the same loop structure ( for instance , foldS <- streamU occurs rather frequently ) but it ’s still very helpful and does n’t require any compiler support whatsoever .
Ignoring toStream which is only called during test data generation , the loop with fold1SS takes by far the most time .
Indeed , it turns out that fold1SS is the problem ; optimising its implementation speeds up the program almost by a factor of 2 .
Implementing all this took less than one day .
I guess this shows yet again : do n’t mess with the compiler if you can mess with the library instead .
Also , use Haskell .
Stupid Ideas Are Still Stupid Even When Amazon Does
Them
This is funny : Amazon has apparently just patented a “ system and method for marking content , ” in which the text of a e-book could be changed slightly with any particular download in order to distinguish that copy from other copies — so if the document is then let loose on the Internets , it could theoretically be tracked down to the source .
It ’s like watermarking , except that in doing so you ’re changing the meaning of the text .
The patent suggests that “ the modification to an excerpt performed by the synonym substitution mechanism may not significantly alter the meaning of the excerpt to a human reader , ” which sounds just like the something that someone who does n’t actually write in human languages for a living might suggest .
Perhaps we should suggest we should go into this software engineer ’s code and swap some of the code around .
Oh , sure , it might not significantly alter the meaning of the code .
But then let ’s run it and see where it gets us .
There is some irony here in that Amazon patent replicates , in intent and general procedure , something called “ Shades of Gray , ” an idea by former vice president of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America .
This former vice president , as it happens , did n’t actually write much , which to my mind would have explained his apparent befuddlement when people in SFWA who actually wrote for a significant portion of their living pointed out that actively corrupting their texts was not really a smart idea .
Nothing much ever came of “ Shades of Gray ” — which is a story in itself — but it was a bad concept then , and it ’s not any better of a concept in the somewhat more refined form Amazon has patented .
I certainly wo n’t be using it , in any event .
Hard as it may be for Amazon to believe , I actually use the words I intend to use when I write .
If I had wanted to use a different word for something , I already would have .
( hat tip : Slashdot )
Everything around us is unified and whole .
Except humanity .
We have been fractured , separated , ripped and torn from The One .
How did this ha ...
1 . Not everything is a federal issue ; some things are for the states to decide .
2 . I hear what you 're saying and you have a good point .
3 . One of the beautiful things about our constitution is the liberty given to individuals to pursue their dreams .
There is great opportunity in our country to succeed .
4 . In an effort to stimulate job growth and despite the objections from my party , I am working with Congress to reduce taxes for small businesses .
5 . I am saddened by the cycle of poverty that exists in our major cities , and here is a way we can empower the next generation to break the cycle and fulfill their God - given potential ....
6 . The folks at the town hall meetings and those who came to Washington on 9/12 were exercising one of the greatest rights we have as Americans , freedom of speech .
7 . Stop already with all forms of ‘ cult of personality ' behavior .
I am a public servant , just like all those who have served before and all who will come after my term is complete .
It 's not about me , it 's about the country .
8 . I heard a great message Sunday morning at church .
9 . History teaches us that evil exists in the world ; for this reason the United States must remain strong , ready to defend itself and its allies .
10 . I did n't realize a communist was part of my administration .
It wo n't happen again .
11 . The billions siphoned out of health care into lawyers ' pockets never healed a single person .
12 . No other country on earth offers its citizens the opportunity to pursue life , liberty , and happiness as does the United States of America .
13 .
The experts have looked at the proposed ( fill - in - the - blank ) program , and when it is extrapolated out beyond just the initial offering there is clear evidence it will cost too much money and will eventually fail .
14 . I disagree 100 % with the Cloward - Piven strategy of increasing the welfare rolls and overwhelming the financial system , and I am not affiliated in any way with the implementation of such an idea .
15 . I do n't know the answer to your question but I will give it some thought .
16 .
The goal of my presidency is not to implement a political ideology , but to preserve , protect , and defend the Constitution of the United States .
17 . Every person has value regardless of age , gender , color , physical characteristics , or any other factor .
18 .
Any healthcare bill I sign must include a provision to exclude the rationing of care , keep the door open for competition among insurers , and promote the opportunity for our young people to pursue an education in the medical fields to ensure future supply meets future demand .
19 .
It is important for legislators to remember that what helps someone in the short - term may actually hurt them in the long - term , and we must avoid this kind of scenario .
When I create new Django projects , I find myself doing a lot of the same things over and over .
For instance , the file structure of each project is pretty much identical , and looks something like this :
deploy wsgi_handler.py
docs
env ( my virtualenv folder )
src apps profiles photos etc. localsettings.py manage .py scripts settings.py static css images js templates urls .py
The things is , I ’m lazy , and it ’s tedious to create all those directories , create my wsgi_handler , uncomment the admin app , update my settings.py , urls.py , etc for every project I create .
I basically end up copying / pasting / deleting from old projects .
So to automate some of that , I made a small reusable django app to serve as a replacement for django - admin.py startproject .
So instead of
django - admin.py startproject project_name
you would do
create_project project_name
To install , either clone the git repository which you can find here :
http://github.com/dziegler/django-create-project
or install with pip using :
pip install -e git+git://github.com/dziegler/django-create-project.git#egg=django-create-project
I made this mainly for my benefit , so some of the settings are tuned to my preferences .
For example , it changes TIME_ZONE in in settings.py from ‘ America / Chicago ’ to ' America / Los_Angeles ’ , and automatically installs django_extensions , debug_toolbar , and django - css because I use those in all of my projects .
Since it ’s on github , it ’s fairly easy to fork and customize to fit your preferences .
You can find it here :

Senior police have been forced to front the media and admit two officers stripped and ran around a police van at a set of traffic lights .
And more naked police may have been inside the van , a senior official has admitted .
But they 've stopped short of conceding the officers had attended a buck 's party at Cleveland , on Brisbane 's bayside .
" I believe it was some sort of pre-wedding party , " Deputy Commissioner ( Specialist Operations ) Ian Stewart told reporters .
The police service 's ethical standards unit is investigating allegations the two officers ran naked from a white Toyota HiAce stopped at the intersection of Moreton Bay and Redland Bay roads at Capalaba about 4.15 pm on Sunday .
The van was believed to be en route from Cleveland to Oxley when the incident happened , sparking a complaint from a woman who reported seeing the naked men re-enter the vehicle after their run .
There was an odd little resolution that passed the House yesterday , H.R. 784 , " honoring the 2,560th anniversary of the birth of Confucius and recognizing his invaluable contributions to philosophy and social and political thought . "
Al Green ( D - TX ) proposed it and there were 41 co-sponsors , primarily progressive Democrats , although a couple of Blue Dogs and one Asian - American Republican signed on as well , Anh Cao ( LA ) .
I guess I even bothered looking at it because I had read something earlier in the day about how the GOP extremists had decided to target an Asian - American judicial nominee , Edward Chen who we had blogged about last week .
Chen 's an outstanding magistrate judge in San Francisco and at Dianne Feinstein 's urging President Obama nominated him to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California .
Every single Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee , at the urging of the Senate 's most blatant racist , KKK member Jeff Sessions of Alabama , voted against him .
Media Matters pointed out that the Republican smear machine has cranked up to slime him .
Fox and the , as usual , are leading the way .
The Moonies claim he does n't love America and O'Reilly pulled some unsubstantiated claim out of his ass that " you ca n't get more radical than Judge Chen . "
Hannity was quick to jump on board ( as usual ) .
So today when I noticed there was a vote on Confucius I thought it would be fun to see who voted against it .
It passed 361 - 47 ( with 13 voting " present " ) , 12 Democrats and 35 Republicans against .
I thought maybe it was some serious advocates of Separation of Church and State .
But no ... just a gaggle of the regular racists , bigots and some of the crazier of the far right - wing Christian supremacists .
Almost all the no votes among Dems were Republican - lite Blue Dogs like Jim Matheson ( UT ) , Jason Altmire ( PA ) , Gene Taylor ( MS ) , Lincoln Davis ( TN ) , Marion Berry ( AR ) , Zack Space ( OH ) , and Brad Ellsworth ( IN ) .
The Republicans were all the regular suspects from Jeff Flake ( AZ ) , Paul Broun ( GA ) , Lynn Westmoreland ( GA ) , Jason Chaffetz ( UT ) , and John Shadegg ( AZ ) to Pete Hoekstra ( MI ) , Kenny Marchant ( TX ) , Ted Poe ( TX ) , Michael Burgess ( TX ) , Mike Conaway ( TX ) , and Sam Johnson ( TX ) .
Did I ever tell you how the first time I ate in a Chinese restaurant in Texas -- it was Amarillo -- they were serving canned Chung King with baskets of rye bread on the tables ?
Randy Neugebauer ( R - TX ) voted " present .
" When accused of bigotry , all the bigots claimed it was too trivial for their attention in such tough times .
Jeff Flake , for example , thought he was being cute to quip : The Confucius bill was voted on at 1:48 PM .
Just before it , at 1:41 PM , the House unanimously passed a resolution , HR 838 , " welcoming to the United States and to Washington , DC , His All Holiness Bartholomew , Archbishop of Constantinople , New Rome , Ecumenical Patriarch on his upcoming trip on October 20 , 2009 , through November 6 , 2009 . "
Flake and the rest of the bigots had no problem with that one .
And then right after the anti-Asian display , another trivial bill Flake and the bigot posse , H.R. 824 sailed through unanimously at 1:58 PM " congratulating the Northwestern University Wildcats on winning the 2009 NCAA women ’s lacrosse championship , and to commend Northwestern University for its pursuit of athletic and academic excellence .

Atomic orbital viewer with WebGL · 2009 - 10 - 04 17:19 by Wladimir Palant
Recently I found an application that I wrote more than 10 years ago — atomic orbital viewer .
Back then I got interested in the pictures of atomic orbitals you get presented in chemistry class , found the special - case formulas for electron distribution and generalized them .
And then I wrote an application to visualize these orbitals .
Since I did n’t have access to 3D hardware or even literature on 3D graphics I ended up reinventing everything — yes , I used to have that kind of time back then .
What came out was a Turbo Pascal ( DOS ) application where I ’ve written almost everything myself , including low - level mouse handling and GUI library .
The big surprise was that this application still more or less worked under Windows XP – if you do n’t count occasional stripes in the picture and the cases where it crashed taking down the entire system ( probably side - effects of a non-standard VESA graphics driver ) .
Not so much under Windows Vista , it no longer supports graphical DOS applications .
Still an application that I would like to have around , so time to reimplement things from scratch .
And what ’s the technology of choice these days ?
WebGL !
Taking vlad ’s
Spore viewer as a starting point , it still took me something like 10 hours ( I ’ve never worked with OpenGL and my linear algebra is a little rusty ) but the result is much better than the original application .
And with some luck it will still be usable in another 10 years and more .
Click here to try it out in a current Firefox nighty build ( make sure to change webgl.enabled_for_all_sites pref to true ) .
It will probably work in WebKit nightlies as well but I did n’t check .
The hardware improved a lot since the time I wrote my original application , these days all calculations are so fast that I did n’t even bother optimizing them ( yes , I know that it would be easy to speed them up by factor 4 , not to mention using web workers ) .
And even my laptop has no trouble rotating 64 k triangles in real time .
Enjoy !

They have called it scruffy , cheap and unloved .
They have sneered at the wire mesh fences and unmowed lawns and the rusting trucks in almost every driveway .
And in time , when the media writes the final chapters of the appalling story of Jaycee Lee Dugard , they may very well conclude that in Antioch , her story was simply an accident waiting to happen .
A staggering 122 registered sex offenders live here , in a small , blue - collar city in northern California that has suddenly found itself at the centre of an international media storm .
More than 100 of them – 102 , to be precise – live in the compact zip - code area containing the suburb that Jaycee Lee 's alleged kidnapper , Philip Craig Garrido , called home .
Two convicted rapists reside on Vine Lane , the street next to Walnut Avenue where Jaycee Lee 's imprisonment and sexual abuse went unnoticed for almost two decades .
On Viera Avenue , less than 200 yards away , is the home of Henry Lee Mickens , a 46 - year - old man who recently served time for " lewd or lascivious acts with a child under 14 years old " .

Dozens of other paedophiles can be found within walking distance .
A mile and a half from Garrido 's front door is Gragnelli Avenue , where the occupant of No 420 , one Shayne Patrick Gaxiola , was convicted of molesting a 12 - year - old girl and impregnating her in 1994 , when he was aged 20 .
Gaxiola was also found guilty of giving marijuana to a string of pubescent girls .
He then took indecent pictures of them .
In 2000 , three months after his release , he was sent back to prison for violating parole after being caught with cannabis and a stash of pornographic magazines .
In a town full of such men , the activities of Philip Garrido seemed simply to slip below the radar – despite the awful track record that has emerged since he and his wife , Nancy , were arrested and charged with 29 counts related to Jaycee Lee Dugard 's abduction , imprisonment , and serial sexual abuse over 18 years ( to which , it must be stressed , they have so far pleaded not guilty ) .
Court papers released yesterday from Garrido's 1977 trial for the kidnap and rape of a young woman in Nevada portray him as a dangerous sexual predator .
During a psychiatric evaluation , he admitted to using LSD and cocaine as sexual stimulants and said that he would often masturbate in public , by the " side of schools , grammar schools and high schools , and in my own car while I was watching young females " .
There is , however , no shortage of similar stories in Antioch .
That is perhaps why , after Garrido was released in 1988 , 10 years into a 50 - year sentence , he and his wife were able to slip virtually unnoticed into the fabric of this community , which stretches for roughly four miles along the Sacramento River .
At first glance , Antioch may look like any other small American city .
Its 100,000 residents are largely white and working class .
Some work in industrial plants .
Others are commuters , unable to afford the cost of living in the San Francisco Bay area .
In keeping with most of California , about 10 per cent are unemployed .
Yet as police continue to investigate Garrido 's past – and look into potential links to 10 murdered prostitutes and three missing girls ( on Monday they announced the discovery of a bone fragment in his garden ) – the city is being forced to confront a grisly truth : for reasons largely beyond its control , it has become a paedophiles ' ghetto .

At fault are laws governing America 's treatment of sex offenders , which control where they are allowed to live and how much information the public should be given regarding their whereabouts .
These laws were passed with the laudable intention of protecting children .
But their actual effect is open to debate .
The most prominent is Megan 's Law , which requires the public to be given access , usually via an internet site , to the names , addresses and " previous " of every man and woman convicted of a sexual offence .
It is a well - intentioned exercise in open government .
But in practice , critics say , it was introduced in such a way as to be of little help to anyone but the voyeuristic .
" Thanks to political pressure , they made the criteria for including someone on the registry so wide that it has become totally ineffective , " says Michael Risher , a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union .
" It does n't just carry details of violent rapists but also people who , say , lost their temper during a road rage incident and flashed at someone , or an 18 - year - old boy convicted of statutory rape for sleeping with his 17 - year - old girlfriend . "
In California , the Megan 's Law website contains 90,000 entries .
Given this extraordinary statistic , it is n't hard to see why the residents of Walnut Avenue – who had 121 other convicted sex offenders in their city to worry about – might have allowed a man with Garrido 's dubious profile to pass largely ignored .
The second group of laws that make Antioch a magnet for paedophiles governs where they are allowed to live .
In California , as in many states , voters have in recent years endorsed Jessica 's Law , which bans paedophiles from residing within 2,000 feet of a school or a park where children regularly play .
This has driven sex offenders out of major cities and conurbations , where they have access to rehabilitation and treatment facilities , and into suburbs and secluded rural areas , where they do n't .
In some smaller cities , they have now become concentrated in such large numbers that parole and law enforcement officers are unable to properly vet them .
This may explain why local authorities never noticed that Garrido was apparently keeping the kidnapped Jaycee Lee Dugard and her two small children concealed in the elaborate series of sheds and tents in his back garden .
Thanks to the influx of offenders to Antioch from major cities , they were simply too overstretched to do their job properly .
It may also explain – but not necessarily excuse – the fact that a police officer dispatched to investigate claims of children living in Garrido 's garden in 2006 seemingly did not have either the time or the wherewithal to thoroughly research his suspect 's background .
" If you look at maps that show where offenders are actually able to live under Jessica 's Law , there 's almost nowhere in the whole of Los Angeles and San Francisco where they can now legally settle , " Mr Risher adds .
" Everywhere is within 2,000 feet of a park or school .
So they all end up in places like Antioch . "
Even police admit that this leaves them struggling to cope .
Daniel Terry , from the Contra Costa County Sheriff 's Department , which oversees Antioch , has about 1,700 registered sex offenders in his jurisdiction .
His station is responsible for about 350 of them , or " 349 more than the number of detectives I have dedicated to monitoring these people . "
Speaking to the Los Angeles Times this week , he said that the region 's concentration of sex offenders was " significantly higher " than other areas in California and the rest of the United States .
" This is the reality .
These people are walking amongst us everywhere . "
Adding to his woes are wider problems in the cheap parts of Antioch where Garrido and many other convicted sex offenders live .
In the ramshackle area around Walnut Avenue , petty theft is rampant , drug abuse endemic – the favourite local tipples are crystal meth and crack cocaine – and lawns are littered with junk .
The city , which grew prosperous on the proceeds of the 1849 gold rush and then the steel mills and concrete factories that allowed it to ship the building blocks of San Francisco down - river during the early 20th century , is now among those caught in the storm of America 's economic downturn .
Nearly 2,500 homes , roughly 5 per cent of the city 's stock , are in foreclosure , with 699 new homes entering arrears last month .
Property values have dropped 40 per cent in the past year and unemployment is soaring .
Garrido's bungalow , a four - bedroom home built on a large plot of land between the wars , is worth just $ 100,000 ( £ 61,800 ) .
Against this background , and helped by laws that encourage ghetto-isation of sex offenders , it now seems that a man known as " Creepy Phil " by neighbours was able to take a little girl hostage , hold her for 18 years , father her two children , and even take them to community events , while barely raising an eyebrow .
In January , Zion Dutro , a convicted child rapist who lived on Alpha Way , not two miles from Walnut Avenue , appeared in court to plead not guilty to performing rape , sodomy and " lewd acts " on at least eight small girls .
He faced 21 counts ; his wife , a co-defendant , faced four .
In any other town , this kind of case would have sparked a mixture of shock and outrage that would be heard across the world .
In Antioch , it merited no more than a few paragraphs in the local newspaper – a reaction which suggests that Jaycee Lee Dugard may not be the last grisly secret that the city reveals .
Sex offenders ' register : Megan 's and Jessica 's laws
Megan 's
Law requires the public to be given details regarding the identity , whereabouts , and criminal record of convicted sex offenders living in their midst .
It was named after the New Jersey schoolgirl Megan Kanka , who was kidnapped , raped and killed by a serial sex - offender in 1994 .
Today , it 's being enacted to varying degrees in every US state .
Like any law passed in response to a public tragedy , the law has been dubbed knee - jerk by opponents , who say it encourages vigilantism and is an infringement on the civil liberties of ex-offenders .
A study last year concluded that the law achieved no demonstrable reduction in child sex offences .
Jessica 's
Law prevents convicted sex offenders from living within a certain distance of schools , parks , and other areas where children gather .
It was first adopted in Florida in 2005 after nine - year - old Jessica Lunsford was snatched from her home , before being raped and murdered by a convicted paedophile .
Today , a version is in force in 42 US states .
Critics say it has made major cities off - limits to offenders , forcing some to declare themselves homeless , and ghettoising others .
There is little evidence that it works .
Many police forces say it has the opposite effect : stretching resources and doing nothing to prevent paedophiles travelling to commit crimes .

Benitez retorted by saying Hodgson is " talking about things that he does n't know , " before saying : " Some people can not see a priest on a mountain of sugar . "
It follows a previous bizarre remark about his departure from Anfield during the summer : " We have a saying in Spanish , which is : ' White liquid in a bottle has to be milk , " ' Benitez said .

It is very likely that PGA golf players are also discovering the social media to boost their popularity and indirectly their sponsors , the golf equipment manufacturers .
Today I found an interesting website ( http://twitter-athletes.com)that collects Twitter accounts of sportsmen from different sports like : NFL , NBA , PGA , LPGA etc .
I think this is one of the new formats of today 's fan clubs and fan zones .
This is how they can be in daily connection with their stars .
PEW market research agency released in May 2009 , an interesting study about the demographic background of Twitter , Facebook , MySpace and LinkedIn .
These are the major findings :
median age of a Twitter user is 31
median age of a MySpace user is 27
median age of a Facebook user is 26
median age of a Linked In user is 40
It also turned out that Twitter users are mobile than other social media users :
The blue columns shows the Twitter users . :)
I guess it is a surprise for many of us , who think about Twitter as a communication channel of youngish guys .
Thus Twitter is not negligible .
Here our smart golf players who already maximizing Twitter in their personal brand communication .
The next will be to create account on Flickr , Facebook , Linked In .
In this way they can a much more intimate relationship with their fans .
Among PGA players , the top 3 players are :
Stewart Cink : 828,819 followers Ian Poulter : 556,918 followers John Daly : 29,990 followers ( he has got really funny messages and also well planned ! )
But where are the big names like Tiger Woods , Ernie Els , Severiano Ballesteros etc . ??

Who Would Want a Farco Air Shotgun ?
By Ronald E. GillPhotos by Stephanie Gill
" Who would want one ? "
My wife Stephanie was referring to my new Farco CO2 air shotgun , and the question stopped me in mid-sentence .
" Well , me of course , " was not a satisfactory answer for my most important editor .
Would other shooters want it too ?
Here are my answers about some of the shooters who would find the Farco air shotgun appealing .
Someone who would want a Farco must have a sense of adventure and humor , because the Farco is an outlandish airgun .
It is a .51 caliber , smoothbore , CO2 powered pellet gun from the Republic of the Philippines .
If that doesnt break all the pellet gun rules , consider that it has a 30 inch barrel and an overall length of 4 feet .
I ordered my Farco from Air Rifle Specialists in New York .
It arrived at my home near Pocatello , Idaho , just after a flash flood closed the county road about two miles below my house .
The Sheriffs Deputy in a four wheel drive led the UPS truck through flood debris to the foot of our washed out driveway .
I looked down from the house and saw Stephanie step out of the mud on to the trucks runningboard to sign the electronic clip board for an airgun I had wanted for years .
The person who wants a Farco must be the kind of airgunner who really appreciates grinder and file marks on a $ 460 airgun .
The Farco is appropriate technology from the Philippines .
This is a hand made gun and it is made with hand tools .
Solder and brass tubing play an important part in its construction .
The Farco came out of the hand - cut styrofoam packing box with no pretensions .
It was just what the Philippine craftsman packed in there .
The kind of craftsman who gets the most out of working with a hammer , file and hacksaw .
I have appreciated this craftsmanship since I was a sailor in the Philippines , where I bought an engraved belt buckle .
The engravers tools were a cold chisel and a center punch .
A reality check for airgunners is a $ 100 Benjamin / Sheridan from the Mart store of your choice .
This gun represents high technology to most folks in the U.S.
A handmade CO2 shotgun from the Republic of the Philippines that costs $ 460 may dumbfound a mainstream shooter .
The same money would buy a nice rifle that would shoot a nice elk that would fill a freezer with nice steaks .
If mainstream shooters are incredulous over a $ 460 airgun , well , they have a valid point .
For the airgunner who wants an air shotgun , the point is that the Farco is very different from most other airguns .
The nickel plated Farco looks and shoots like a Silver Streak on steroids .
The Farco shoots shot or round balls at 100 foot pounds of energy .
That is 6 to 10 times the energy of domestic airguns , and this is only one of the differences .
It is loaded with reusable brass shells that have to be removed from the gun after each firing .
There is no extractor or ejector .
The shells slide to the rear as the bolt is opened .
Then they are removed by hand .
Twelve shells made from 1 inch long pieces of brass tubing the same size as the barrel come with the gun .
Loading the shell with loose shot is very much like loading a muzzleloader .
First , a thick wad ( analogous to an over powder card ) is pushed into the shell .
Then the shot is added and a thin wad is placed over the shot .
The gun came with a 17/32 inch wad cutter to make wads from sheet cork , cardboard , or other materials .
When shooting round balls , a plastic .50 caliber muzzleloader sabot and a .433 round ball are pressed into the shell .
These removable shells make the Farco air shotgun unlike most airguns where the shooter simply loads a pellet by itself and fires .
The first time I shot my Farco it felt like a big sling shot .
It sounded like the valve was fluttering , and then I heard the rat tat tats of the shot hitting an empty cereal box 20 yards away .
The 7 1/2 shot hit the box with enough force to go through both sides .
I had fun experimenting with various kinds of wads and shot , but I really wanted to shoot it with round balls .
To see how the gun would do with round balls , I set up a 2 x 2 piece of 0.040 " sheet metal at about 30 yards .
I aimed at the center of the target and squeezed the trigger .
There was the hushed report followed by a metallic thump of the lead ball deforming against sheet iron .
The time lag between the shot and the thump made the perception of power much more intense .
I walked up to the target and found a dent 2 inches in diameter and 1 inch deep .
Just then , airgunning took on a whole new dimension .
I was born to go fooom !
Big bore airgunning was what I had wanted and the Farco delivered .
Shooting .433 round balls from 50 yards , the airgun from Manila can topple a 1 / 2 size ram silhouette that weighs just over 10 pounds .
More amazing was all that power comes from CO2 .
This CO2 gun does not take 12 gram Powerlets .
The large tube under the barrel holds 4 - 5 ounces of liquefied gas , and is refilled from a separate ten ounce cylinder that is provided with the gun .
This is not new ; the first CO2 gun I ever shot was filled with CO2 from a cylinder that had to be refilled at the refrigeration plant .
With my new Farco , I use a five pound tank to refill the ten ounce cylinder .
I can connect the two tanks with an adapter from Air Rifle Specialists
This way , I dont have to go back to town every time the smaller cylinder runs dry .
Some people who have watched me shoot are as interested in the refilling as in the shooting .
The kind of shooter who wants a Farco air shotgun will be someone who wants to share the fun of shooting .
Most people smile when they see the Farco .
Their smiles usually broaden after they shoot it , as I learned at our local shooting range .
At the range , several friends gathered to see my new gun .
My friend Neal wanted to be able to say he shot the Farco .
I handed him a shell loaded with a round ball , and suggested a sight picture for the 25 yard target .
" Oh no , I m going for something further , " and he aimed for a 4 X 8 foot target board at 200 yards .
We all watched to see where the ball would hit .
We knew in our hearts the ball would fall short of the target .
None of us saw dust .
Finally , " THUMP ! "
We had thought the ball could no longer be in flight when we heard it strike the board .
Ten shots later , no one had duplicated Neals shot .
On another trip to the range , Valerie , my 11 year old daughter , and I shot the Farco .
Valerie reloaded the shells with the 120 gr. balls and sabots and shot the Farco through the chronograph .
She tried to shoot it offhand , but it was too big and clumsy for her , so she shot from a rest .
The gun won her approval : " That s a neat gun , Dad . "
Valerie and I measured three successive shots with .433 round balls : 533 , 522 and 508 fps .
The lead ball and sabot weigh 135 gr .
We calculated energy figures of 85 , 82 , & 77 foot pounds respectively .
My Farco was not delivering to the 100 + foot pounds of energy I had read about .
The kinetic energy for the first shots I measured were in the low 70s .
However , with more shooting the Farcos voice got deeper .
Airguns wear in with shooting , and this guns velocity was getting faster .
The most recent shots were 574 fps ( 99 foot pounds ) for round ball and sabot , and 440 fps ( 103 foot pounds ) for 240 grains of 7 1/2 shot .
The Farco is powerful .
Against steel rams at 50 yards the lead balls flatten to the size of quarters .
Its major role is as a shot gun , and at 20 yards it will shoot 7 1/ 2 shot through an aluminum pop can filled with water .
The hunter who wants to hunt with an air shotgun is a hunter who wants to use stealth and skill to get a step closer to the game .
For all its power the Farco is a limited range weapon .
An air shotgunner will have to pass up shots that could be made with a 12 gauge or a .22 long rifle .
A hunter with an air shotgun has to get closer to the game , but there is a reward .
Hunting at closer range is hunting at a higher skill level .
Who would want to own a Farco air shotgun ?
Well , me of course , but there are others .
A shooter who is looking for something different and who has a sense of humor and adventure .
A gun owner who knows hand made can leave marks from hand tools .
A hunter who wants to hunt more with stealth than power .
Someone who likes to have fun and share it with others .

Remind me again how we have the greatest healthcare system in the world - because I have a feeling ERs are going to be swamped with cases like this all winter :
CORPUS CHRISTI —
The mother of a man who died of a swine flu - related illness said her son was asked to leave a Texas hospital a day before his death because he was lying on the floor , too ill to sit in a chair .
Irving Neil Range , 58 , of Corpus Christi died in the emergency room of Christus Spohn Hospital Memorial on Friday of a swine - flu related illness , confirmed Annette Rodriguez , interim director of Corpus Christi- Nueces County Public Health District .
Opal Range told the Corpus Christi Caller - Times that her son went to the emergency room Oct. 1 , but laid on the floor because he felt too sick to sit a chair while waiting to see a doctor .
She said a security guard asked him to leave so he went home .
Her son returned to the emergency room the next day and died .
Sherry Carr - Deer , a spokeswoman for Christus Spohn Health System , told The Associated Press that she did not know the specifics of Range 's case , but that their security guards generally try to work with people and give them a couple of chances .
“ Our security guards do n't escort anyone out or ask them to leave unless they become belligerent , ” she said .
Health officials said Range did n't appear to have any underlying health conditions that may have contributed to his death .

BUSH FAMILY EUGENICS AGENDA DOCUMENTED VERY HEAVILY
In my last email ( archived at :
http://www.ymlp.com/controlpanel/archive_showmessage.php?&id=204
I gave you information about a recent British Medical Journal article which documents that President GW Bush will be announcing a plan in July to screen the entire US population for mental illness .
The article documents Bush 's close connections with Eli Lilly and other pharmaceutical companies , but the situation is even worse than I realized .
Someone on the IAHF distribution list sent me the following URL Chapter - III - Race Hygiene : Three Bush Family Alliances http://www.kmf.org/williams/bushbook/bush3.html
from the unauthorized biography of George Bush at http://www.kmf.org/williams/bushbook/bushb.html#Table which I encourage you all to examine closely because the information it contains is shocking and undeniably true -
It proves that GW Bush 's plan to screen the whole US population for mental illness is only the MOST RECENT in a long string of EUGENICS actions perpetrated by the Bush family since GW 's grandfather , Senator Prescott Bush ( also Skull and Bones just like " W " and his father before him ) was fined for violating the trading with the enemy act during WW2 .
It documents the connections between the Rockefellers , Standard Oil , Farishes , Drapers , Harrimans , Grays and Bushes - showing the Bush / IG Farben connection .
It tracks the global Eugenics movement , showing how the movement was able to install its racist population control agenda as official US Government Policy being carried out via USAID ( US Agency for International Development ) which US taxpayers are currently giving millions of dollars which are being used to fund STERILIZATION programs all over the third world .
It documents that all of Bush 's personal wealth is managed in a blind trust run by William Stamps Farrish III , grandson of William Stamps Farrish .
On March 25 , 1942 , U.S. Assistant Attorney General Thurman Arnold announced that William Stamps Farish ( grandfather of the President 's money manager ) had pled " no contest " to charges of criminal conspiracy with the Nazis .
Farish was the principal manager of a worldwide cartel between Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey and the I.G. Farben concern .
The merged enterprise had opened the Auschwitz slave labor camp on June 14 , 1940 , to produce artificial rubber and gasoline from coal .
The Hitler government supplied political opponents and Jews as the slaves , who were worked to near death and then murdered .
It documents that Prescott Bush ( GW 's grandfather ) was via his involvement with Brown Brothers Harriman directly involved with the funding of IG Farben , the Pharma Cartel comprised of Hoechst , Bayer , and BASF which fueled Hitler 's rise to power , ran the concentration camps , and produced a lot of the munitions and other supplies used by the Nazi war machine during WW2 .
At the Harrimans ' 1932 New York Eugenics Congress , Ernst Rudin was unanimously elected president of the International Federation of Eugenics Societies .
This was recognition of Rudin as founder of the German Society for Race Hygiene , with his co-founder , Eugenics Federation vice president Alfred Ploautz .
As depression - maddened financiers schemed in Berlin and New York , Rudin was now official leader of the world eugenics movement .
Components of his movement included groups with overlapping leadership , dedicated to :
sterilization of mental patients ( " mental hygiene societies " ) ;
execution of the insane , criminals and the terminally ill ( " euthanasia societies " ) ; and
eugenical race - purification by prevention of births to parents from " inferior " blood stocks ( " birth control societies " ) .
Before the Auschwitz death camp became a household word , these British - American - European groups called openly for the elimination of the " unfit " by means including force and violence .
It documents that George Herbert Walker Bush ( GWs father ) was the US Ambassador to the UN in 1970 when the policies of USAID were infused with the UN's , and of course the UN administers the Codex Alimentarius Commission which is attempting to ban consumer access to high potency vitamins and other supplements .....

Clockwise : A female hybrid , male hybrid , polar bear and brown bear ( all pictures courtesy of Alexandra Preuß )
What do you get if you cross a polar bear with a grizzly brown bear ?
Scientists can now answer the question , following the first study of a polar bear / grizzly bear hybrid .
Only one hybrid bear has ever been seen in the wild , so the study evaluated two hybrid bears kept in captivity , which are among 17 such bears known to exist .
While each hybrid has inherited characteristics from either parent , some traits , such as partially hollow hair , appear to be a blend of the two .
" Hybrids between polar and brown bears in the wild are very rare .
Only one confirmed case is known , " says Dr Ute Magiera , the conservation coordinator of Osnabruck Zoo in Germany .
We were surprised about the offspring , because for 24 years nothing happened
Dr Ute Magiera
Osnabruck Zoo , Germany
That hybrid bear was shot in April 2006 by an American big game hunter on Banks Island , Northwest Territories , Canada .
However , a small number of hybrid bears do exist in zoos in the Czech Republic , Israel , Russia , Spain , Poland and Germany as a result of grizzly bears , a subspecies of brown bear , and polar bears being held in the same enclosures .
At Osnabruck Zoo , for example , both species were kept together since 1980 , producing no offspring .
Then in January 2004 , a female brown bear gave birth to two brown / polar bear hybrids at the zoo .
" We were surprised about the offspring , because for 24 years nothing happened , " says Dr Magiera .
Spot the hybrid : From left to right , female hybrid , male hybrid , polar bear and brown bear
Soon after their birth , the hybrids were moved to another zoo , preventing them from learning any behaviours from either parent .
Now Dr Magiera , Dr Alexandra Preuß of the University of Osnabruck and Osnabruck Zoo and colleagues have published details of the hybrid bears in the scientific journal Der Zoologische Garten .
Physically , the hybrids have a range of characteristics .
In terms of overall size , they fall between the larger polar bear and slightly smaller grizzly .
They have longer necks more typical of polar bears , but also display small shoulder humps reminiscent of brown bears .
Wild hybrid shot in 2006
The size and shape of their heads is intermediate between the thicker - set brown bear and more slender - headed polar bear .
Hybrids have visible tails , like polar bears , whereas those of brown bears are barely apparent .
The bears ' feet are also an intriguing blend .
The soles of the hybrids ' feet are partially covered in hair .
Polar bear feet are covered in hair to insulate them from the ice , whereas brown bears have hairless soles and clearly visible toes .
But most intriguing is the bears ' hair .
When viewed as a cross section , the shaft of a brown bear 's hair is either solid or full of small hollow regions , depending on where the hair is on the bear 's body .
The hair of a polar bear is almost completely hollow , with large empty regions within its core .
The shaft of the hair from a hybrid bear has hollow pockets , compared with the hollow shaft of polar bear hair , and closed shaft of brown bear hair
The hair of the hybrid bears display a blend of both .
Hair on the paw of the male hybrid is solid .
But dark hair on the male 's back is hollow , but with smaller empty regions than found in polar bear hair .
The hair on the female contains a range of hollow regions .
Behaviourally , the two hybrids have much in common with polar bears .
When given large toys to play with , such as tractor wheels or barrels , both bears used their front legs to stamp on the object , just as polar bears stamp onto ice to break through to seal dens .
Hybrid bear feet are partially covered with fur ; polar bear feet are fully covered and brown bear feet uncovered
The hyrbids also used their teeth to hurl jute - bags from left to right , as polar bears may hurl prey .
Brown bears given similar bags do not show this behaviour .
The male hybrid bear has been sterilised .
But if the female proves fertile , it suggests that hybrid bears could continue to breed in the wild if their ranges overlap more , says Dr Magiera .
Brown bears ( Ursus arctos ) and polar bears ( Ursus maritimus ) split into distinct species around 200 - 300,000 years ago .
Generally , their modern ranges do n't overlap ; the brown bear is found in the montane forests of the Holarctic and tundra , while the polar bear frequents the Arctic .
Hybrid bears lie down just as polar bears do
However , in some regions of the Canadian Arctic and Siberia , brown bears do venture on to pack ice , potential bringing them into contact with their more northerly relative .
Some experts say that global warming and diminishing ice packs will lead to polar bears spending more time on the mainland .
While some think that a few populations of polar bear may return permanently to their original mainland habitat , others say that climatic changes will happen too fast for the bears to adapt .

In a recent Financial Times editorial ( July 30 ) , Josef Ackermann of Deutsche Bank made his case for larger banks , arguing that they are beneficial and only the “ interconnectedness ” of banks caused our massive financial market failure .
“ Big , beautiful banks ” may have nice , expensive buildings ( if you happen to be in one ) but little else to recommend them .
Small banks may not have ornate , expensive buildings , but they get the job done with far less risk and cost to consumers and shareholders .
Research undertaken by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve found few if any benefits to scale beyond $ 5 or $ 10 billion in asset size .
So , for customers and shareholders , big is not obviously better , although for executives , life is good , pay is great .
The ultimate in “ interconnectedness ” is one bank with thousands of branches .
So with one bad decision at headquarters , the entire system goes down .
Credit standards are set by one officer for the entire economy , there is no “ competition ” for innovation in lending technologies or risk - taking .
Mr. Ackermann is correct about the risk of interconnectedness as was illustrated by news headlines last fall : “ Credit markets frozen – banks wont led to each other . ”
I thought banks were supposed to lend to consumers and businesses , not to each other .
That was indeed the start of our troubles .
In a globalized market , “ trapped pools of liquidity and capital ” would not occur , capital flows easily where returns call .
But with many independent suppliers of capital , there is more scrutiny , less chance that one big pool of capital will be poorly allocated or put at risk by risk - taking adventures or bad decision making .
Studies of the National Federation of Independent Business ’ ( U.S. ) hundreds of thousands of members revealed that SMEs were best served in the U.S. in unit banking states ( banks were allowed only one branch ) and least well served in states allowing state - wide branching .
Loan terms and satisfaction were always highest in states permitting only one bank branch .
Big banks do not serve this vital economic community well .
The 8,000 independent banks in the U.S. buffered the financial shock for SME’s , and now are unfortunately being required to pay for the losses to depositors generated by “ large ” banks .
FDIC insurance costs are typically 500 % higher than just two years ago , seriously impairing the earnings of these smaller banks .
Maybe we would n’t need “ internationally coordinated crisis management ” if we did n’t have mega banks lending to each other into markets that they are unfamiliar with , taking risks they should not take with our money .
Large banks may be useful for large firms , but they need not be nearly as large as those we have today or that we had last year before they brought down our financial system .
Adults do n't technically need to sleep , we 've just been trained to sleep from infancy .
Oh we need it all right , things usually get pretty dicey after a few nights of no sleep .
Religious practices and information How many North Americans attend religious
services ( and how many lie about going ) ?

Quotations : " Americans misreport how often they vote , how much they give to charity , and how frequently they use illegal drugs .
People are not entirely accurate in their self - reports about other areas as well .
Males exaggerate their number of sexual partners , university workers are not very honest about reporting how many photocopies they make .
Actual attendance at museums , symphonies and operas does not match survey results .
We should not expect religious behavior to be immune to such misreporting . "
Kirk Hadaway , a sociologists at the United Church of Christ , ( 1993 ) 1,2
, ( 1993 ) " ... despite the rhetoric , active religious participation remains a minority interest in American life . "
Tom Flynn , writer for Free Inquiry magazine , ( 1998 ) .
2 1999 : Reported attendance at religious services by Americans and Canadians : Item USA Canada Attend at least weekly 43 % 20 % Never / almost never attend 8 % 38 %
This data is taken from the Millennium Study by Taylor Nelson Sofres Intersearch in 1999 .

For years , pollsters have been asking adult Americans whether they go to religious services regularly .
Typically , the specific question asks whether they attended a service during the previous weekend .
The results have been relatively constant over time .
Some recent estimates are : 38 % by the National Opinion Research Center .
. 44 % by the Institute for Social Research 's World Values survey .
This institute is located at the University of Michigan .

World Values survey .
This institute is located at the University of Michigan .
The Barna Research Group reported that in 2005 , " 47 % of American adults [ said that they ] attend church in a given weekend , not including a special event such as a wedding or a funeral . "
5
In earlier years , attendance varied from 37 % to 49 % : 1991 : 49 % 1992 : 47 % 1996 : 37 % 1997 : 43 % 2000 : 40 % 2001 : 42 % 2002 : 43 % 2004 : 43 %
reported that in 2005 , In earlier years , attendance varied from 37 % to 49 % : The Gallup Poll conducts yearly polls asking the question : " Did you , yourself , happen to attend church or synagogue in the last seven days , or not ? "
They reported the following attendance levels .

The margin of error is ~+mn~2 % : 1992 : 40 % 1993 : 40 % 1994 : 42 % 1995 : 43 % 1996 : 38 % 1997 : 40 % 1998 : 40 % 1999 : 43 % 2000 : 44 % 2001 : 41 % 2002 : 44 % 2003 : 41 % 2008 : 42 % 2012 : 41 % 2016 : 39 % 2017 : 38 %
The margin of error is ~+mn~2 % : Between 2008 and 2014 , church attendance varied little .
However , between 2014 and 2017 , attemdance has been reported as steadily dropping -- slightly faster than one percentage point per year .
National Election Studies ' poll shows that in 1996 , 25 % of adult Americans claimed to attend church , synagogue or temple every week ; 12 % almost every week ; 16 % once or twice a month , 18 % a few times a year , and 30 % never .
7
Assuming that " almost every week " means 3 weeks out of 4 , then these data indicate 40 % attendance .
The estimate of 40 % church attendance is widely reported in the media .
Andrew Walsh , editor of the " Religion in the News " magazine and professor of religion in public life at Trinity College , commented in 1998 : " Since the late 1930s , the Gallup Organization has been asking pollees if they ' happened to attend ' church or synagogue in the past seven days . '
Invariably , about 40 percent respond that they have done so .
Long running surveys like the General Social Survey of the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago , the Harris polls , and the polling of the Barna Research Group in California have tended to support the 40 percent figure . "
" This number is so commonplace that when polling data on church attendance is released , as it is several times each year , American journalists usually relegate it to news notes or use it as a springboard to other stories . "
1
How many people lie about going to religious services ?
Various studies in recent years have cast a grave doubt on the 40 % value .
Public opinion polls generally do not report real opinions and events .
They report only the information that the individuals choose to tell the pollsters .
Quite often , their answers will be distorted by a phenomenon called " social desirability bias . "
Pollees answer questions according to what they think they should be doing , rather than what they are doing .
For example , a poll by Barna Research showed that 17 % of American adults say that they tithe -- i.e. they give 10 to 13 % of their income to their church .
Only 3 % actually do .
9
The gap between what they do and what they say they do is closer in the case of religious attendance .
It is " only " about 2 to 1 .
Church attendance studies by Hadaway , Marler , and Chaves : Kirk Hadaway and Penny Marler wrote : " Like other social scientists who use survey data , we trusted Gallup poll results because we knew they employed sound sampling methods .
Doubts emerged , however , when we compared statistics on church membership from American denominations to Gallup 's reports on church attendance .
If the percentage of Americans attending church is stable , aggregate church membership should have increased as the American population grew .
But after adding together denominational membership statistics ( including estimates of membership for independent congregations ) we found that the aggregate membership total has been virtually static since the late 1960s .
This contradiction led us to wonder if Americans were reporting the same level of attendance to pollsters while their actual church participation was dropping .
Our first study provided an initial test of this dynamic .
Subsequent research confirmed it in important ways . "
10 Hadaway , Marler , and Mark Chaves counted the number of people attending four Protestant churches in Ashtabula County , OH , and in 18 Roman Catholic dioceses throughout the U.S.
In their 1993 report they stated that actual attendance was only about half of the level reported in public opinion surveys : 20 % vs. 40 % for Protestants , and 28 % vs. 50 % for Roman Catholics .
1,11
They later returned to Ashtabula County to measure attendance by Roman Catholics .
They physically counted the number of attendees at each mass over several months .
They concluded that 24 % of Catholics in he county actually attended mass .
They then polled residents of the county by telephone .
51 % of Roman Catholic respondents said that they had attended church during the previous week .
Apparently , a slim majority were lying .
Later in 1993 , Jay Demerath of the University of Massachusetts referred to the gap between poll results and reality .
He said : " Gallup and other pollsters are aware of this .
It 's kind of a dirty little secret . "
1
Many academics were not convinced that the 20 % church attendance estimate was valid .
Thomas Smith of the National Opinion Research Center said : " There 's a claim that surveys lead to overreporting of church attendance , which seems to be correct .
The question is by how much .
We have n't nailed down how much Americans exaggerate . "
1
In 1998 - FEB , Hadaway , Marler , and Chaves published another article reinforcing the validity of their 20 % church attendance rate estimate .
Hadaway told the Minneapolis Star Tribune : " We believe that too much trust has been placed in survey data and not enough attention given to membership records , patterns of giving , and even the incredulity of local church pastors when they hear that 40 percent of Americans attend church during an average week . "
2 , 12 Church attendance studies by Presser and Stinson : It gets worse .
Sociologist Stanley Presser of the University of Maryland and research assistant Linda Stinson of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics completed a study of notes in personal diaries .
These time - use diaries were maintained for social scientific research projects in the mid-1960s , 1970s and 1990s .
Those participating in the projects were asked to keep track of their activities .
The 1992 -1994 diaries , for example , were used by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to determine exposure of the participants to harmful substances in the environment .
Presser and Stinson found that many Americans were not at church when they claimed to be .
Their best estimates are that the percentage of adults who actually attended religious services during the previous weekend dropped from 42 % in 1965 to 26 % in 1994 .
Presser said : " We asked people , tell us everything you did in the last 24 hours so we can know what chemicals you might have been exposed to .
If somebody went to church , they ought to tell us , but if they did n't go , they should n't manufacture it .
We did n't do what most polls of religious belief do , and ask , ' Did you go to church in the last seven days ? , ' which some might interpret as being asked whether they were good people and good Christians . "
13 The Washington Post reported that the analysis " reveals a discrepancy between the diaries and the polls , and suggests that many Americans have been misreporting how they spend their Sunday mornings , inflating estimates of church attendance by perhaps as much as a third . "
14 American Atheists commented : " The researchers also found that the percentage of Americans who lie about their attendance is increasing .
Presser and Stinson described the 16 - point drop off in church attendance ' really very striking '... "
14 If this study by Presser and Stinson is accurate , it would indicate a substantial drop in actual church attendance from the mid 1960s to the mid 1990s .
Since the reported attendance has remained stuck at the magical 40 % figure for decades , one might conclude that the rate of exaggeration of church attendance is increasing .
Also , it would appear that polls are to be mistrusted .
Nobody really knows what the percentage attendance is .
To obtain accurate data , pollsters will have to abandon the comfortable task of polling opinion by phone and camp out in church , synagogue , and mosque parking lots so that they can count noses .

More recent polling results : Tom Flynn , writing for the Free Inquiry magazine wrote : " Some pollsters have refined their survey instruments after the 1993 Hadaway paper .
Gallup changed its questions , but continued to report weekly churchgoing at over 40 % .
Yet when the National Opinion Research Center ( NORC ) redesigned its mammoth General Social Survey ( GSS ) , church attendance figures declined sharply .
For many years GSS data had supported Gallup 's ; the redesigned 1996 GSS reported that only between 29 and 30.5 % of Americans attended church in the last week , a figure similar to Presser and Stinson's . "
" Hadaway , Marler , and Chaves wonder , " To what extent do these findings challenge the conventional wisdom that Americans are a very religious people ? "
At the least , they would seem to reinforce the claim that despite the rhetoric , active religious participation remains a minority interest in American life . "
2
Over-reporting in other countries :
The 50 % figure also appears to apply in the UK .
Author Monica Furlong commented on the Church of England data : " ... people questioned about how much they go to church , give figures which , if true , would add up to twice those given by the churches . "
15 Hadaway and Marler noted that when Gallup asked people in Great Britain what they did during the previous weekend , and presents a list of likely activities , they found that 14 % said they went to church .
But when the question that Gallup asks in the US ( " Did you , yourself , happen to attend church or synagogue in the last seven days ? " ) is asked in Great Britain , the weekly attendance rate rises to 21 % .
They state that : " ... figures from the 1989 English Church Census and additional attendance data from the 1996 - 97 UK Christian Handbook indicate that only around 10 percent attend worship services each week . "
10 Hadaway , Marler , and Chaves repeated their Ohio study in Oxford Country in southern Ontario , Canada .
Most polls show that 20 % of the adult population say that they go to church weekly .
Again , half were lying , as only about 10 % actually attend church weekly .
Fluctuation in church attendance after the 9 - 11 terrorist attacks :
There was a surge in church attendance after the terrorist attacks on New York City and Washington on 2001 - SEP - 11 .
Some religious leaders predicted that the phenomenon would be short lived .
Others saw it as the start of a major revival in the U.S. According to the New York Times , Franklin Graham , son of the well known Christian evangelist , Rev. Billy Graham , hailed it as an enduring turn toward God .
On NOV - 20 , Fundamentalist Christian Pat Robertson said that the attack was : " ... bringing about one of the greatest spiritual revivals in the history of America .
...
People are turning to God .
The churches are full . "
8
It appears that , with the exception of the New York City area , the increase lasted only about two months .
By 2001 - NOV - 26 , attendance had returned to normal .
The New York Times cites data from the Gallup Organization , which shows that religious attendance rose from 41 % in 2001 - MAY to 47 % by 2001 - SEP - 21 .
By early November , attendance had sunk back to 42 % .
The director of the Center for the Study of Religion at Princeton University , Robert Wuthnow , said that the terrorists ' attacks have not changed the basic makeup of the U.S. : About one in four of American adults is devoutly religious ;
one in four is secular , and
the remaining half is mildly interested about religion .
Wuthnow said : " We are in some ways a very religious country , especially compared to Western Europe .
But we 're of two minds , and the other mind is that we really are pretty secular .
We are very much a country of consumers and shoppers , and we 're quite materialistic .
And as long as we can kind of paste together a sense of control through our ordinary work and our ordinary purchases , we 're pretty happy to do that . "
8 Rabbi Ronald S. Roth of West End Synagogue in Nashville , TN , said : " We did see a larger influx for the holidays , and the mood was very intense .
I can't say , however , that this increased interest in services has been sustained ... When people face such a tragic and horrible event , they need comfort , they need community , they need to relate to their God and their traditions , and try to find a way to get through the pain .
Once I think people got past some of the initial shock and difficulties , they started to get back to how it was before . "
A poll conducted by Barna Research Group showed no increase in 11 of the 13 key measures of religiosity due to the terrorist attacks .
Individual churches growth rate : Church researcher and author , Thom Rainer , led a research team that concluded in 2012 that : " 94 percent of our churches are losing ground in the communities they serve . "
That is , their church attendance is not growing as fast as the population growth rate in their community .
16 Decline by denomination : Outreach Magazine reported in 2018 - APR that : " The most significant drop in attendance came at the expense of the Catholic Church , which experienced an 11 percent decrease in its attendance percentage from 2000 to 2004 .
Next , and not far behind were mainline churches , which saw a 10 percent percentage decline .
Evangelicals experienced the smallest drop at 1 percent . "

COLUMBUS , Ohio -
Sitting up straight in your chair is n't just good for your posture - it also gives you more confidence in your own thoughts , according to a new study .
Researchers found that people who were told to sit up straight were more likely to believe thoughts they wrote down while in that posture concerning whether they were qualified for a job .
On the other hand , those who were slumped over their desks were less likely to accept these written - down feelings about their own qualifications .
The results show how our body posture can affect not only what others think about us , but also how we think about ourselves , said Richard Petty , co-author of the study and professor of psychology at Ohio State University .
" Most of us were taught that sitting up straight gives a good impression to other people , " Petty said .
" But it turns out that our posture can also affect how we think about ourselves .
If you sit up straight , you end up convincing yourself by the posture you 're in . "
Petty conducted the study with Pablo Briñol , a former postdoctoral fellow at Ohio State now at the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid in Spain , and Benjamin Wagner , a current graduate student at Ohio State .
The research appears in the October 2009 issue of the European Journal of Social Psychology .
The study included 71 students at Ohio State .
When they entered the lab for the experiment , the participants were told they would be taking part in two separate studies at the same time , one organized by the business school and one by the arts school .
They were told the arts study was examining factors contributing to people 's acting abilities , in this case , the ability to maintain a specific posture while engaging in other activities .
They were seated at a computer terminal and instructed to either " sit up straight " and " push out [ their ] chest ] " or " sit slouched forward " with their " face looking at [ their ] knees . "
While in one of these positions , students participated in the business study , which supposedly investigated factors contributing to job satisfaction and professional performance .
While holding their posture , students listed either three positive or three negative personal traits relating to future professional performance on the job .
After completing this task , the students took a survey in which they rated themselves on how well they would do as a future professional employee .
The results were striking .
How the students rated themselves as future professionals depended on which posture they held as they wrote the positive or negative traits .
Students who held the upright , confident posture were much more likely to rate themselves in line with the positive or negative traits they wrote down .
In other words , if they wrote positive traits about themselves , they rated themselves more highly , and if they wrote negative traits about themselves , they rated themselves lower .
" Their confident , upright posture gave them more confidence in their own thoughts , whether they were positive or negative , " Petty said .
However , students who assumed the slumped over , less confident posture , did n't seem convinced by their own thoughts - their ratings did n't differ much regardless of whether they wrote positive or negative things about themselves .
The end result of this was that when students wrote positive thoughts about themselves , they rated themselves more highly when in the upright than the slouched posture because the upright posture led to confidence in the positive thoughts .
However , when students wrote negative thoughts about themselves , they rated themselves more negatively in the upright than the slouched posture because the upright posture led to more confidence in their negative thoughts .
Petty emphasized that while students were told to sit up straight or to slump down , the researchers did not use the words " confident " or " doubt " in the instructions or gave any indication about how the posture was supposed to make them feel .
In a separate experiment , the researchers repeated the same scenario with a different group of students , but asked them a series of questions afterwards about how they felt during the course of the study .
" These participants did n't report feeling more confident in the upright position than they did in the slouched position , even though those in the upright position did report more confidence in the thoughts they generated , " Petty said .
That suggests people 's thoughts are influenced by their posture , even though they do n't realize that is what 's happening .
" People assume their confidence is coming from their own thoughts .
They do n't realize their posture is affecting how much they believe in what they 're thinking , " he said .
" If they did realize that , posture would n't have such an effect . "
This research extends a 2003 study by Petty and Briñol which found similar results for head nodding .
In that case , people had more confidence in thoughts they generated when they nodded their head up and down compared to when they shook their head from side to side .
However , Petty noted that body posture is a static pose compared to head nodding , and probably more natural and easy to use in day - to - day life .
" Sitting up straight is something you can train yourself to do , and it has psychological benefits - as long as you generally have positive thoughts , " he said .
For example , students are often told when taking a multiple - choice test that if they 're not absolutely sure of the answer , their first best guess is more often correct .
" If a student is sitting up straight , he may be more likely to believe his first answer .
But if he is slumped down , he may change it and end up not performing as well on the test , " he said .

Oracle ’s pending acquisition of Sun has been hit with a new hurdle .
The European Commission ( EU ) wo n’t let Oracle proceed till it clearsout the new matter raised .
EU is concerned that Oracle ’s will terminate the open source MySQL project , a move that would have a detrimental impact on competition in the database market .
In light of the resilience inherent in open source software , it ’s unclear if such a maneuver would even be possible .
A look at the Past
Oracle has a good history when it comes to open source .
In 2005 , they acquired Innobase , the company that makes the InnoDB storage engine for MySQL .
InnoDB powers any serious installation of MySQL because it supports transactions and generally acts like more of a grown - up than MySQL ’s default storage engine , MyISAM .
When Oracle bought Innobase , there were same kind of confusions .
Does this mean the end for MySQL in enterprise applications ?
It turns out that all of these concerns were proved irrelevant when Oracle continued to support and develop InnoDB , telling MySQL that though we are competitors , we support Open Source .
They managed to keep InnoDB ’s dual - licensing structure :
The product is GPL ’ed , but if you want to buy a commercial license for it , you ’re more than welcome to .
After Innobase , Oracle bought Sleepycat Software in 2006 .
For those who do n’t know - Sleepycat produces BerkeleyDB , which is the de facto standard for embedded databases .
Berkeley DB was also distributed under this dual license , which made more sense for embedded software than it did for something service - oriented like InnoDB .
Oracle continues to develop and support BerkeleyDB , but uses it as a starting point to up - sell customers on its TimesTen embedded database and Oracle 11g .
The EU Controversy
EC commissioner Neelie Kroes says that the absorption of leading open source database software by a company that sells competing proprietary database requires close scrutiny .
Specifically , the commissioner fears that Oracle will discontinue ongoing development of MySQL , reducing the choices that are available to consumers and potentially forcing users to buy the database giant ’s more costly enterprise solutions .
In an economic climate that is encouraging companies to cut costs by adopting open source software solutions , the rapid growth of MySQL has the potential to cannibalize Oracle ’s lucrative database business .
It ’s still entirely unclear if Oracle intends to kill MySQL or capitalize on the open source trend by making MySQL a core part of its business .
Oracle could also simply boost commercial MySQL support contract costs to a level that makes the open source option unappetizing for commercial users .
The uncertainty surrounding this issue has compelled regulators to put a hold on the acquisition .
The Associated Press reports that the EU is exploring potential remedies such as forcing the MySQL division to be sold off separately to a different buyer .
Although Oracle ’s acquisition of Sun made sense , but it ’s hard to believe that Oracle could truly kill off MySQL even if it really wanted to .
Widenius , the founder of MySQL , hopes that Oracle will be Open to collaborating with the community in a positive way , but he says that he is fully prepared to provide an alternate path forward for the current MySQL community and third - party vendor ecosystem if Oracle decides to play mean or take its toys and go home .
The evidence strongly suggests that the open source database will live on regardless of what Oracle decides to do .
Von Finck points out that MySQL ’s licensing model gives the copyright holder a higher level of control than the rest of the community and the exclusive ability to provide certain kinds of products and services that third - party vendors cannot .
This means that Oracle ’s acquisition of Sun would still have significant implications for competition in the database market .
” If Oracle were to release MySQL under a different license , say the Apache license , this issue would be mitigated to an extent .
But for now , Oracle has many more avenues of [ MySQL - related ] business and revenue than do others . ”
“ It ’s clear that Oracle is a smart company .
And the goal of any smart company is to return value to their shareholders .
In this context , if MySQL was seen by Oracle to be cannibalizing their core business and revenue stream , I think there are quite a few actions they could take that would not resonate well with open source thought leaders , MySQL users , or individuals that value a competitive market .
There are certainly steps that could be taken to ensure that the acquisition of the world ’s most popular open - source database by the world ’s largest commercial database vendor do not remove choice for users and ensure a viable and competitive database marketplace . ”
MySQL Dominance
Today , 70 % of Webservers use MySQL as their database of choice .
Reason being lightweight , speed and reliable for most online solutions .
It ’s not limited online systems , SMEs also found MySQL cheap and attractive alternative to hefty databases and thanks to Recession , it ’s even more in demand .
MySQL is NOT limited in features even when you compare it with Leading databases like Oracle .
It supports Clustering with load balancing / sharing , disaster management , Grids , table - spaces , partitioning and you name it And that ’s why it has been a choice of many Enterprises .
What ’s more is the world ’s best search engine , Google , also uses a customized version of MySQL .
( though they open sourced a part of it . )
Oracle and the Decisive leader
Larry Ellison is smart , honored business man .
He favors Open Source like no one else does .
Considering all that is said , he would never take a decision that could go against millions .
Neither Widenius , Nor Oracle will NOT let innovation in MySQL go in vain .
MySQL will live forever .
cheers .

Dungeons and Dragons Online went live back in 2006 , and a number of my friends took part in the beta , enjoying the game immensely .
Then the product went live , and they never played again .
The reason was simple : the game was $ 50 , the monthly fee was $ 15 , and for many gamers that 's a hard sell .
Then suddenly , a week or so ago , everyone was playing again .
A thread about the game popped up on our forum .
Where did this buzz come from ?
Simple : the game was once again free to play .
You can still buy a subscription , and that comes with a number of benefits , but you can also download the client for free , and play a huge chunk of the game without paying a single cent .
We caught up with Fernando Paiz , the Executive Producer of the game , to explore what might be the next big thing in online gaming : not charging .
" We 're hitting and exceeding our internal targets , so far we 're very happy , " he told Ars when we asked how the game has grown since becoming free .
" All aspects of our business are growing .
Hundreds of thousands of new players in the world are playing for free , with a very high percentage using the store . "
The internal projections for growth were doubled .
Even more surprising , subscriptions have gone up 40 percent since the game has gone free - to - play .
Here 's how it works .
Anyone can download the client and create a character and start playing .
As you level up , you can buy everything from hair dye to new adventures and dungeons using Turbine points , which can be bought with either real money or earned in the game .
You can still subscribe , which gets you more character slots and a monthly allotment of Turbine points , as well as some other perks .
A new way to grab players
" It does totally change the rules of the game , but it 's very much in the player 's favor , " Paiz explained .
" They get to try the game , not be constrained by a one - week trial , and then decide when they 've made the commitment that they 're engaged enough that they 're ready to spend money . "
They do n't want you to feel that spending money in the store is the only way to play the game .
" As you advance , more of the content is for purchase more than it 's free .
Not that there wo n't be free content in the higher levels ... but still , if you 're into the game and you 're playing past level five or six , you 're going to really start thinking about buying content packs , or saving up Turbine points to buy content packs . "
It 's fascinating to see this in action .
One of my gaming buddies organized a small four - person LAN party to play the game .
Everyone had a good time , and better yet , no one had to sign up and give out their credit card to get a group together .
They simply downloaded the client , created characters , and started adventuring .
A week later , he purchased his first content pack to play with other people he met online .
This is someone who would never sign up for a monthly charge , but this business model — in short order — made him get his wallet out .
The difference is , it all happened on his terms .
None of this was an accident .
Turbine even updated how Dungeons and Dragons Online was delivered in order to make the game more accessible .
" The new download technology allows you to get the character generation and the tutorial zone and start playing while the rest is downloading in the background .
You can be playing in 30 minutes instead of 4 hours ... in order to get to that broader audience we can't abuse them the way the rest of the MMO audience has been abused in the past few years . "
What 's intriguing is that by removing the $ 15 a month charge , they 've also removed the ceiling on how much consumers are willing to spend .
" We have a good chunk of the population that is spending more than $ 15 a month , " Paiz said .
" The traditional subscription model can only make X dollars off a player .
This kind of removes that cap . "
It 's hard to get someone to agree to $ 15 a month until they cancel ; it 's easier to get them interested in inexpensive quests and small add - on items and classes .
Even better is that people want to play this content together , meaning people will buy the content packs in groups .
Free can be a good deal for everyone
" The number one reason people play MMOs is that their friends do .
Now it 's a lot easier to get your friends in to play with you , " Paiz told Ars .
The player who downloads the client , makes a character , and never visits the store still has worth to Turbine .
That player is going to invite their friends to play , since online games are much more fun with a group .
Those players will fill up the servers and help with the in - game economy and quests .
There will be new threads on gaming fora , new LAN parties with people trying out the game , and that 's going to lead to more people ultimately paying for upper - level quests or introducing players to the game that will .
Many of the barriers to playing an MMO have been removed with D&D .
You do n't have to sign up for a monthly charge .
You do n't have to buy any software , and you can have the game up and running in around thirty minutes instead of wrestling with installations and updates and patches .
If you want someone to play with , invite a friend .
By giving away the game and much of the content , players are up , more people are subscribing , and the buzz around the game has never been stronger .
Will we see this model replicated ?
More than likely .
For now though , Paiz has invited me to jump onto the server to see what all the fuss is about .
Why not ?
I have nothing to lose .
Vancouver in British Columbia , Ciudad Juárez in northern Mexico and Helmand Province in southern Afghanistan are unlikely cousins .
But together these three places and their ilk have wrought a remarkable change in one of the world ’s most important debates over the past two years .
For decades , the idea of legalizing narcotics was supported by only a small minority .
But as global markets in illicit drugs have expanded exponentially since the early 1990s , policy makers and law enforcement agencies alike have been overwhelmed by the challenge posed by the prohibition of a long list of drugs .
Markets have spread to places that for decades had no significant drug problem , like China and Indonesia , while the numbers of addicts in countries like Iran have grown hugely .
Two significant developments are contributing to the sudden surge in calls for reconsidering prohibition .
The first is that drugs are now damaging long - term Western security interests , especially in Afghanistan and Mexico .
The second is that production is migrating away from its traditional homes like Colombia and the Golden Triangle and moving into the heart of Western consumer areas like Canada , the Netherlands and Britain .
The problem is becoming so dramatic that elder statesmen , senior law enforcement officers , intellectuals and philanthropists the world over are speaking out loud and clear :
The “ War on Drugs ” is a disastrous policy that achieves none of its aims and inflicts huge damage on global security and governance wherever it is prosecuted .
The trick or treaters will be out in force this weekend for Halloween , which means many churches will be celebrating All Hallows and All Souls Day .
But one of the oldest churches in Brisbane will be celebrating the lives of some of the city 's earliest settlers who are still buried under major infrastructure of the inner-northern suburbs .
For nearly 170 years , thousands of bodies have been lying under parts of inner-city Brisbane .
In 1843 , Brisbane was a small but rapidly expanding port and farming city .
Dirt roads and thick bushland surrounded the city 's then fringe suburbs of Milton and Paddington .
As the city expanded , it was not just the living that needed somewhere to rest .
Hundreds of people were dying and there was no room to bury them .
Gailene Harrison from the Christ Church Historic Society , says a five - acre site was chosen to the north of the city , as the final resting place of the early pioneers .
" Lots of mothers died giving birth and lots of little children died , " she said .
First public cemetery
Between 1843 to 1875 , as many as 2,000 bodies were buried in Brisbane 's first public cemetery on the border of what is now the suburbs of Milton and Paddington .
The cemetery soon filled up and in the 1850s fell into disrepair .
Wild goats were running rampant and drunks used to frequent the then dark and dirty part of Brisbane .
The old Moreton Bay Courier newspaper began reporting on nearby residents falling ill as heavy downpours sent dirty run-off from the cemetery , into the Milton reservoir .
" People died because of infections , they caught terrible infections from the putrid water and mosquitos , " Ms Harrison said .
" They just had a very poor hygiene . "
The only visible remnant left today is the small wooden church and adjoining memorial garden next to Lang Park stadium .
Ms Harrison says the church was built on the old Anglican mortuary in the middle of the cemetery .
" Which does n't sound very charming , but apparently they fitted about 50 or 60 people in it and then they saw the need to build another church for Christ Church parish , " she said .
Toowong cemetery
In 1866 , the council began clearing trees at a new 260 - acre site at Toowong .
Ms Harrison says families were encouraged to exhume their ancestors , before redevelopments began in the Milton area .
" The bodies are still there but the cemetery 's long gone of course , " she said .
" In its place , the councillor at its time saw fit to build sport fields .
" So all of those areas are really changed now into places of joy . "
Today Lang Park Stadium , a council pool , childcare centre and scores of homes sit on top of the burial grounds .
Remembrance celebration
Ann Fiddler , also from the Christ Church Historic Society , says every year her community stops to remember these somewhat forgotten souls of early Brisbane .
" All Souls Day is in the church calendar and every year we celebrate all souls that have passed away and that are no longer with us , " Ms Renal - Fiddler said .
" It 's a celebration of their life and what they meant to the community and to each and every person . "
She says out of the thousands of tombstones from Brisbane 's earliest cemetery , only a dozen now serve as a memorial at the church site .
" I did have a couple of people call me , they were looking for a great - great grandmother , " she said .
" Another gentleman was looking for a great - great uncle and I had to say unfortunately , they 're not the names that we 've got unless they 've been moved to Toowong .
" Unfortunately a lot of the tombstones were crushed and used for road fill and taken away .
" If they 're not there or if that did n't happen to them , they are unfortunately under Suncorp Stadium . "
Gruesome murder
Only a few dozen bodies were exhumed from the old Milton Cemetery and taken to the spacious resting grounds at Toowong .
One of these who made the move , caused quite a stir in his living years .
Patrick Mayne was known by locals as a wealthy rogue , who used to horse whip people he did not get along with .
Brisbane historian Rosamond Siemon says Mr Mayne was responsible for one of Brisbane 's most gruesome murders in 1848 at the old Bush Inn at Kangaroo Point .
" One night , the people had been drinking until closing time which was quite late at the hotel , and parts of the body were found next morning , lying either side of that spit of Kangaroo Point , " she said .
" The legs were on one side and the torso and arms on the other .
" The head was eventually found propped up on a building that was being constructed and the entrails were found put down a well in the hotel , where they kept their milk , butter and cheese down under the hotel . "
She says another man was hung for the murder and several years later Patrick Mayne confessed to the deed on his deathbed .
" The person who was called in for this was the cook form the hotel , " Ms Siemon said .
' He clearly did n't do it , he would n't have been so mad as to put all the entrails of a corpse he 'd murdered all over the food he had to eat .
" Apart from that he had a good alibi from the publican and his daughter . "
But Mr Mayne met his fate at the age of 44 after a severe mental condition left him in and out of hospital .
' Parks for people '
After they died , the Mayne family were some of the ones who were removed from Milton before the ' parks for people ' program redeveloped the old cemetery in the early 1900s .
" There was one problem with the Milton Cemetery , a very big problem ; when it rained it flooded and a lot of the corpses used to float , " Ms Siemon said .
" One of the fellows told me , his grandfather used to say every time it was raining , ' I think Paddy [ Patrick Mayne ] will float again today ' .
" Whether he did or not , we 'll never know . "

Elegant Nostalgia and Utter Loneliness : All Hail to Taxi Cabs !
Photography by : Joseph O. Holmes
Are you talkin’ to me ?
Well , I ’m the only one here .
– Travis Bickle in “ Taxi Driver ”
All Hail to Taxi Cabs ! is a superb collection of beautiful photographs taken of taxi cabs from all around the world .
From our own perspective of experiences as passengers riding in the cabs cruising around our towns and cities , many of the photographs of the taxis presented here are both old and rare , and can elicit both feelings of nostalgic reminiscence and memories from earlier times in our lives .
But these remarkable photographs draw upon yet another perspective , that of the often isolated taxicab driver .
“ Are you talkin ’ to me ?
Well , I ’m the only one here , ” said Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver .
It is this last line , “ Well , I ’m the only one here , ” that has seldom ever gotten quoted .
Yet , it stands as perhaps the truest line in the film .
In a sense , taxi drivers throughout the world represent people with a desperate need to make some kind of contact somehow , to share or mimic the effortless social interactions they see all around them , but in which they ca n’t or do n’t really participate .
This feeling of utter loneliness is at the center of the film Taxi Driver .
We have all felt as alone as Travis .
Fortunately , most of us are better at dealing with it .

( CNN ) -- Chris Brooks , just 22 , was out for a night of bowling with friends .
Exhausted , on the way home , he texted his girlfriend , " I 'm dead . "
Fifteen minutes later , he was -- clinically dead -- suffering an unexplained cardiac arrest on the couch at home , right in front of his parents .

The same night Chris Brooks died , he came back to life .
Doctors say that for every minute without a heartbeat , your odds of survival go down 10 percent .
Chris Brooks was out for more than 20 minutes -- and yet he survived , without even a hint of brain damage .
Doctors at the University of Pennsylvania 's Center for Resuscitation Science , where Brooks was treated , call him a medical miracle -- but cases like his are increasingly common , thanks to advances in basic emergency techniques including improved CPR and cooling patients to a lower body temperature .
Here 's the catch : Many hospitals and doctors do n't know or want to use the latest techniques -- and so survival rates for cardiac arrest vary tenfold among major cities .

And that 's about the best official response to a lawsuit we 've ever heard at Kotaku .
If only legal battles could be settled in a contest of wits instead of extended litigation and a series of public relations disasters .
The world would be a better place .
As head of Berlin 's Bauhaus in the 1930s , Mies van der Rohe led the movement to change the world 's attitude to buildings .
Hitler had other ideas - yet , rather than flee , Mies chose to stay in Germany .
Why ?
Tom Dyckhoff investigates
On the morning of April 11 1933 , the architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe turned up for work as normal .
It was not a normal day .
The Bauhaus , the 20th century 's greatest school of art , architecture and design , was closed .
The building was cordoned off by armed police and surrounded by crowds .
Mies ' pace quickened .
" Stop ! " he shouted at the officers .
" What 's the idea ?
This is my school !
It belongs to me ! "
Not any more , said an officer : the Gestapo was scouring the school for a secret printing press suspected of publishing anti-Nazi propaganda , and documents linking Bauhaus to the Communist party .
Mies was released after an interrogation .
But the Bauhaus stayed shut .
The next day , Mies , knuckle - headed and stubborn as ever , went to the top .
Alfred Rosenberg , the conservative minister of culture in the newly elected Nazi government , was renowned for his iron temperament .
But then , so was Mies .
" The Bauhaus has a certain idea , " began Mies , in his nagging , methodical monotone , " but this idea has nothing to do with politics .
Look at your writing table , this shabby writing table .
Do you like it ?
I would throw it out the window . "
Mies rarely minced his words .
" That is what we at the Bauhaus want to do .
We want to have good objects so that we do not have to throw them out of the window . "
Rosenberg was an architect himself .
" Then we will understand each other , " said Mies .
" What do you expect me to do ? " asked Rosenberg .
" The Bauhaus is supported by forces fighting our forces . "
" For any cultural effort , " replied Mies , " one needs peace , and I would like to know whether we will have that peace . "
The Bauhaus stayed shut .
So Mies tried another route .
Every other day , he marched to Gestapo headquarters .
This time , it took him three months to get to the top .
On July 21 , with the Bauhaus on the brink of bankruptcy , a letter arrived from the Gestapo giving permission to reopen , but only if the curriculum was rewritten to suit " the demands of the new State " , and if two of its leftwing teachers , Ludwig Hilberseimer and the painter Vasili Kandinsky , were replaced with " individuals who guarantee to support the principles of the National Socialist ideology " .
Mies gathered his colleagues , opened the champagne , and promptly closed the school himself .
Mies was pathologically strong - willed , so protective of his independence that he would close his own school rather than submit to the demands of anyone else .
Even the Nazis .
Mies had schooled himself as modernism 's cold , steely heart .
He was n't verbose and dilettantish like Le Corbusier .
He did n't douse himself with sociology like Walter Gropius .
He did n't dress the flamboyant dandy like Frank Lloyd Wright , all cape and cane .
All were diversions , Mies thought .
Instead , he presented himself as a monolithic figure , silent and sober , like a monk .
He read St Thomas Aquinas , St Augustine , Plato and Nietzsche .
He had certainty .
He had a plan , and politics was n't part of it .
Which was exactly why he 'd ended up at the Bauhaus .
By 1933 , the school was a global cult , sending out from its converted telephone factory eager young missionaries to spread the modernist word : honesty of construction , death to decoration .
Under its first director , Gropius , and its second , Hannes Meyer , these students were also trained in socialism - the efficient , industrial mass production of " good objects " for the people , which had led it into often violent controversy .
Mies was made director to bring order and discipline , and above all to make the Bauhaus apolitical .
In 1930s Berlin , however , the politics of architecture would prove impossible to ignore .
Mies believed , he said , in something more noble than politics , the ruthless pursuit of the perfect modern building , the true heir , he thought , to Greek temples and gothic cathedrals - buildings constructed on earth in order to escape it .
These were cathedrals for the new religion , commerce and industry - factories , office blocks , skyscrapers and apartment towers , the modern urban landscape , whose architecture had yet to be invented .
The form lay out there for him to discover .
" The will of the epoch , " he said , must be " translated into space " - as if he were just the draughtsman for a higher system , the universe 's appointed architect .
Mies is known now for his American architecture - it was there that he was able to make his modern " cathedrals " a reality .
But it was in Berlin , in the prewar years , that his ideas were formed .
Like his students , he was a convert to modernism .
In Berlin 's cultural explosion of the early 1920s , Mies , then in his mid 30s , switched lives .
Out went the provincial name , Ludwig Mies , with its reminders of his lower - middle - class upbringing in the deeply conservative Catholic Rhineland .
In came the more cosmopolitan Mies van der Rohe .
Out went his conventional wife and children , relegated to annual visits .
In came a succession of mistresses , and wild nights with Berlin 's avant garde .
And out went Mies ' formal classical design , taught to him by architects struggling to come to terms with the 20th century , attempting to stretch the styles of the past around radical new building types such as the modern factory .
Sometimes these old styles just would n't fit .
Modern buildings required a whole new architecture .
Like any eager convert , Mies took modernism to extremes .
Throughout his life , nothing got in the way of his quest for pure form : politics , family , mistresses , clients , ideas that ill fitted his single - minded worldview - all were brushed aside .
Even practicality .
In the 1930s , he designed furniture that users " must learn to love " ; and , after the war , venetian blinds on New York 's Seagram Building that would stop only in aesthetically pleasing positions ( backed up with contractual subclauses to ensure that nobody replaced them with drapes of lesser beauty ) ; Berlin's National Gallery without walls ( they might interrupt its vast empty space ) ; and houses , such as the Farnsworth House in the US , that had a notorious aversion to ugly essentials such as plumbing , heating and mosquito nets .
He would bully his clients to the law courts to get his way , the very model of the arrogant architect .
All of which would have been unforgivable were his buildings not breathtaking .
Mies took the modern steel frame , which removed the structural need for walls , as far as it could then go , to create the kinds of crisp , idealised , abstract spaces that his contemporaries in the visual arts , Piet Mondrian and Theo van Doesberg , were exploring on canvas .
He once built a chapel in the US so bare , so pure , that it had to have a sign attached - " Chapel " - to tell the visitor where they were .
" God , " he said , " is in the details . "
This was a man whose eye had been trained by chiselling headstones in his father 's stonemason 's yard , who could spend days perfecting the cross-section of a beam and weeks labouring over minute mathematical ratios that only he could see .
He created his masterpiece , the German Pavilion at the Barcelona Exposition , in 1929 : a series of empty spaces , removed of every physical encumbrance that technology would allow .
Enclosure was suggested only by a series of planes , arranged with formal geometry , like a Mondrian painting .
Nothingness , transparency , was used as a kind of expression .
Visitors would touch its floor - to - ceiling glass walls , the world 's first , to see how they stood up - if they stood up .
The whole building appeared so lightweight that it threatened to float away into the sky .
" It contains only space , " dismissed one critic .
But that was the point .
The world had seen nothing like it .
We 're used to open - plan homes and offices today , but in 1929 it was a revolution to the senses .
This , said one newspaper report at the time , was " the modern feeling " .
This was exactly why Germany 's pre-Nazi Weimar Republic had chosen Mies to represent it .
During the 1920s , it had fashioned itself into the most modernist of states .
If you were a young designer , hungry for work , Germany - and , most of all , the Bauhaus - was where you came .
For the Barcelona fair , the Weimar government wanted to project the image of a modern , progressive , peaceful Germany , emerging again on the world stage after the humiliations of the first world war .
" We do not want anything but clarity , simplicity , honesty , " said Georg von Schnitzler , commissar general of the Reich , at the official opening .
Not that Mies bought this , of course .
A building , to him , was not a piece of propaganda , but something to escape worldly distractions such as politics .
Still , so long as it brought in work , he was happy to play along : he did n't care for whom he built , so long as they had lots of money , lots of power and did n't get in his way .
So Mies , Weimar Germany 's rising star , designed the kinds of buildings that his newly prosperous country would need , such as the world 's first glass - and - steel skyscraper , a stunning shaft of quartz ; the first modern office block , which , 50 years before the Pompidou Centre and the Lloyd 's building , used its guts , its structure , as abstract exterior decoration ; and , at Barcelona , the world 's first truly open - plan house .
He had time only to build the last .
A few weeks after the Barcelona fair opened , stock markets across the world crashed .
The Depression dried up his stock of wealthy German clients and a new kind of German politics was on the horizon .
It , too , would use architecture as propaganda .
But it was n't Mies ' kind of architecture .
It was hard for someone to ignore politics in 1930s Germany , but Mies did his best .
To this freakishly single - minded man , the rise of nazism was like a fly buzzing around him while he worked , getting ever closer and increasingly destroying his concentration .
When the Bauhaus closed in 1933 , it seemed as if Alfred Rosenberg 's völkisch rightwing had the upper hand , with their sentimental attachment to folksy architecture .
With them in charge , the very pitch of your roof could land you in trouble .
They 'd had their eye on the Bauhaus 's internationalist cult for years .
In 1925 , the school , then led by Gropius , was forced to leave Weimar , Germany 's intellectual heart , by the city 's rightwing .
It was drummed out of Dessau in 1932 , too , when local Nazis took the council .
They threatened to build proper Teutonic pitched roofs and gables on the building 's bolshevik flat roofs to show who was boss now .
The Nazis even found fault with Mies ' thoroughly apolitical directorship when he moved the school to Berlin , simply for what they thought his abstract modernism represented .
Leaving aside the school 's degenerate , internationalist , rootless , Jewish , bolshevik membership , the newly christened International Style - white walls , steel and glass , and flat roofs - just was n't German .
Yet Hitler himself had not quite made up his mind about modern architecture .
In the early 1930s , he was strongly influenced by propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels , who had recognised the progressive , symbolic power of industrial modernism - it might be useful .
In early September 1933 , Hitler spoke at a culture conference , fiercely criticising radical art but accepting " a functionalism of crystalline clarity " in design .
Like Mies , Hitler was obsessed with industrialism , the symbolism of technology , the theatre of getting things done .
He even spoke the Bauhaus language : " To be German , " said Hitler , " means to be logical , above all to be truthful . "
Music to Mies 'ears .
Industrial modernism could so easily have become the language of autobahns and vast Nazi meeting halls .
Starved of work , Mies tried to ingratiate himself with this new , powerful and rich state patron , signing a motion of support for Hitler in the August 1934 referendum and joining Goebbels 's Reichskultur - kammer , a progressive alternative to Rosenberg 's ministry , which asked for " fresh blood " and new forms to give " expression to this age " .
Mies was shortlisted to build the state 's new Reichsbank , with a fiercely modern , abstract design ; and Goebbels even pressed him to design the Deutsches Volk Deutsches Arbeit exhibition .
Things were on the up .
But in 1934 , Hitler , by chance , came across Albert Speer , a young architect who had caught the Nazi bug .
Speer had joined the party as head of its local Motorists '
Association , and only as its head because he was the only car driver in his neighbourhood .
There just happened to be a lot of influential Nazis at the Wannsee local HQ .
With furious speed , Speer found himself spun from apprentice to chief architect for Goebbels 's propaganda ministry , then to designer for Nazi rallies at Tempelhof Field , and then , in 1934 , to Hitler 's personal architect , designing , the Führer promised , " buildings for me such as have n't been built perhaps for 4,000 years " .
Speer never quite understood his luck .
All it took to end modernism , and Mies , in Germany was Hitler and Speer 's obsessive personal relationship .
Hitler was an amateur architect , a trainspotter - he had once been refused admission to the Viennese Academy 's architecture school - and liked nothing better on a Sunday afternoon than to pore over plans with eager - to - please Speer .
He would discuss the minutiae of cross-sections and tinker with designs , which he always referred to as " my building plans " , as if Speer were merely the conduit for Hitler 's grand visions .
But where Goebbels challenged Hitler 's taste for sentimental nationalist architecture , Speer indulged it .
Speer was a first - rate administrator , but a second - rate architect , a decent enough exponent of the polite classicism that Mies had ditched years earlier , but a dab hand at the kind of populist theatricality that caught the Führer 's eye .
And so , by chance , it was decided that the Third Reich 's landscape was not to be the sleek , industrial modernism of the Barcelona Pavilion , but Hansel and Gretel gothic , and a bombastic classicism of inflated porticoes , pediments and columns , with all their cheap analogies with the Roman empire .
With Leni Riefenstahl , Speer became the Nazi's stage manager , designing ever larger , more extravagant stage sets , from the Nuremberg rally complex to the Cathedral of Light , 130 anti-aircraft searchlights shooting in the air , their thrusting verticality , apparently , to lead the eye away from the paunches of the marching party leaders .
And , of course , there was Hitler 's special commission , the complete rebuilding of Berlin , followed by every other major German city .
Hitler so adored Speer 's vast detailed model of a Berlin reborn , complete with ambitious domes and giant 's avenues , that he would gaze lovingly at what might have been while burrowed deep in his bunker in 1945 , with the allies at the door .
With Speer now in charge , the conservatives extended the cultural policy of Gleichschaltung ( bringing in line ) from publishing and art to building , simply by controlling the planning system and making sure they had the right sort of people on competition juries .
Hitler cancelled the Reichsbank competition on which Mies was depending financially .
And every architect was forced to adjust his or her style to suit .
Except Mies .
He did n't know any other way .
Between 1931 and 1938 , only two out of 12 houses were actually built .
But , though politics had caught up with him , Mies kept ploughing on .
He was even willing to bend his design to suit the Nazis .
Slightly .
His competition entry for the national pavilion at the 1935 Brussels World 's Fair was his last attempt to angle German national architecture towards modernism .
The abstract plan is there , only it is grander , more symmetrical than usual ; the stark , plain walls are there , but Mies would never have added an eagle and swastika - decoration - in happier times .
In the end , there was no money for the pavilion ; not that he'd have won .
Speer 's pompous national pavilion at the Paris fair in 1937 was more to Nazi taste now .
And how strikingly similar it looked , remarked Speer himself , to the Soviet pavilion sitting opposite .
Mies seemed to dislike the Nazis more for their poor taste and their starving him of work than for their politics .
Nazi architecture , to Mies , was hardly architecture at all , mere stage sets , " sentimental " , emotional .
It was an aberration , something that got in the way of his ideal of pure , abstract modernism .
He never passed comment directly on Speer , but it must have galled him to see this youngster succeed with so little .
Designing the will of the epoch , the architecture for the German state , was once meant to be Mies ' job .
In this upstart 's hands , it was being realised in the clumsiest of forms .
So , stubborn to the last , Mies just sat it out , waiting for change , waiting for the latest obstruction to shift , and damning the Nazis the way he damned family , lovers and everything else that got in his way : with silent withdrawal .
More solitary than ever , and getting by on the royalties from his furniture , Mies spent the mid-1930s designing endless variations of prototypical , ideal buildings - the museum , the office , the university - each , like Erik Satie 's Gymnopedies , variations on a theme , subtly different from the last .
They remained on paper .
He built up a backlog of fantasies that he'd build one day , once the Nazis had disappeared .
And he had every faith that they would .
But Mies ' reluctance to condemn Nazi politics saw him attacked by many of his former Bauhaus colleagues , many of whom , Jewish or leftwing , had left for Britain and the US soon after the Nazis took power .
Like many other less threatened German artists , such as the composer Richard Strauss , Mies hung on longer than he should simply because he refused to believe that Germany , once a hotbed of cultural invention , had suddenly become so stupid .
Mies finally decided to leave Germany while standing in a field in Wisconsin in late 1937 .
He was in the US following up one of the many offers of work from wealthy Americans , which had started coming his way after a star billing at the opening exhibition of New York 's new Museum of Modern Art in 1932 .
Since he was in the neighbourhood , he decided to visit Frank Lloyd Wright , the doyen of American architecture , in his Wisconsin ideas factory , Taliesin West .
Mies liked the midwest , with its flat , empty , abstract fields , ripe for his otherworldly spaces .
It suited his aesthetic .
And , deep in the belly of the continent , far from the Nazis - far , indeed , from any interference - it suited his way of working .
No one would disturb him here .
Standing in a field outside Wright 's studio , he shouted , " Freiheit !
Es ist ein Reich ! " ( " Freedom !
This is a kingdom ! " )
Mies had packed for an overnight stay , but ended up staying a week .
" Poor Mr Mies , " said Wright .
" His white shirt is quite grey ! "
Mies liked America , too .
After the Depression , it was becoming fat again , with rich capitalists ready to commission him .
Mies could always sniff out where the money and power was .
And he could smell in those fields that his future patron would be no government , no political system , but the economic system that was emerging triumphant in the US .
Modernism , the International Style , would succeed as the landscape not of communism , bolshevism or nazism , but of international capitalism .
Its modern Medicis , such as Mies , were n't interested in politics .
Well , not the politics of nationalism , just the quieter , subtler politics of making money .
Like the Weimar government , they would commission buildings such as New York 's Seagram tower more for their sleek , modern , sellable image , and efficient and highly lucrative ways of parcelling up space - " Mies means money , " 1950s speculators chirruped - than for the perfection of their form .
They would n't see God in the details , but they would leave him alone to build all those ideal skyscrapers , office blocks , houses , convention centres and apartment towers he had spent the 1930s mapping out in his head .
He could escape politics .
He could build .
That was enough .
Mies ' American friends told him not to return to Berlin in March 1938 .
They were right .
After the Anschluss of Austria , and the previous year 's Degenerate Art exhibition in Munich , the climate had become more conservative than ever .
Even Mieswas under suspicion , with Nazis sniffing around his associations with communists and Jews in the Bauhaus .
Politics had got to him at last .
For the first time , he was nervous in his own country , so nervous , in fact , that , to avoid meeting the Gestapo , he sent his assistant to pick up his emigration visa at the local police station .
When the assistant returned , he found Mies being roughly interrogated by two officers .
At the eleventh hour , the time had come to follow the millions before him and make his own , rather less noble escape from the Nazis .
Mies packed what he could in a small suitcase , hurried on to a train to Rotterdam and took the steamer to New York

IF there 's one thing most celebs have in common it 's their penchant for bad behaviour .
Never a day goes by when newspapers are n't filled with stories of some A - lister falling out of clubs , out of love with their partners or simply out of low - cut tops .
Even those who have a reputation for being good will at some point do something that us mere mortals would never dream of - simply because they can .
Now some of our biggest stars ' naughtiest moments have been gathered by Loose Women panelist Carol McGiffin and comedy writer Mark Leigh in a new book called Celebrities Behaving Badly : Lifestyles of the Rich and Shameless .
We take a look at some of the best tales of rudeness , tantrums , excesses and stupidity featured in the book .
Film producer Don Simpson ( Flashdance , Beverly Hills Cop and Top Gun ) used to get through $ 60,000 a month on alcohol , prescribed drugs and cocaine .
This might account for some of his unpredictable and bad behaviour towards his various secretaries .
On one occasion he could n't open his hotel room window so he threw a chair through it , then made his secretary personally pay for the damage .
He made another one read and watch pornography with him and schedule call girls .
Another time he screamed at his PA because there were too many clouds during one of his plane trips .
Singer Johnny Cash and assorted friends once checked into a Minnesota Hotel with some quick - drying red , black , orange and green paint plus rollers - then proceeded to paint each wall of the room in a different colour .

It was touch and go whether rap mogul P. Diddy would proceed with an interview with Radio 1's Trevor Nelson in 2006 .
The problem was the plates .

Diddy refused to eat the platter of fresh fruit and pastries that the BBC had thoughtfully prepared for him unless they were served from china crockery .
Moments before the interview , BBC staff borrowed china plates and cups from a local cafe and the interview to promote his album finally went ahead .
When Demi Moore wanted to fly from Idaho to New York to attend a premiere of A Few Good Men in 1992 , Sony sent a private jet to pick her up .
According to reports at the time she felt the jet was too small as its hold would not accommodate all her luggage without putting one case on top of another .
She demanded the studio send her another jet for the rest of her luggage - and they did .
Christina Aguilera is said to always demand a police escort because her travel needs state that ' under no circumstances can her vehicle encounter any delays due to traffic ' .

The late Freddie Mercury could host a party like no other .
Queen 's legendary New Orleans launch party for their 1978 album Jazz had something for everyone .

October 7 , 1989 : Former US Secretary of State George P. Shultz tells an alumni gathering at Stanford Business School , " It seems to me we 're not really going to get anywhere until we can take the criminality out of the drug business and the incentives for criminality out of it .
Frankly , the only way I can think of to accomplish this is to make it possible for addicts to buy drugs at some regulated place at a price that approximates their cost ...
We need at least to consider and examine forms of controlled legalization of drugs ...
No politician wants to say what I have just said , not for a minute . "
October 2 , 1992 : Thirty - one people from various law enforcement agencies storm Donald Scott 's 200 - acre ranch in Malibu , California .

October 5 , 1999 : The war on drugs is " an absolute failure , " says Gov. Gary Johnson of New Mexico at a conference on national drug policies at the Cato Institute .
Johnson , who drew sharp criticism from anti-drug leaders for being the first sitting governor to advocate legalizing drugs , argues that the government should regulate narcotics but not punish those who abuse them : " Make drugs a controlled substance like alcohol .
Legalize it , control it , regulate it , tax it .
If you legalize it , we might actually have a healthier society . "
Johnson also meets with founding members of Students for Sensible Drug Policy ; footage from the meeting appears on CBS evening news .

Big government Senator resorts to race pimping in an attempt to discredit the Texan Congressman
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Thursday , October 15 , 2009
Neo-con Lindsey Graham resorted to race - pimping the other night when he attacked Congressman Ron Paul for representing “ angry white men , ” to which Paul responded on CNN by pointing out that Graham represents the exact opposite of true conservatism .
During a town hall meeting on Tuesday night , Graham was heckled by the audience and called a “ traitor ” for his decision to back Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor , and for his support for climate change legislation .
“ The troubles all started Sunday , when Graham co-wrote an Op - Ed article with Massachusetts Democratic Sen. John Kerry in the New York Times called “ Yes We Can ( Pass Climate Change Legislation ) , ” which talked about their campaign to corral bipartisan support for climate change legislation , ” reports the L.A. Times .
During the meeting , protesters responded to Graham ’s claim that he would grow the Republican party by shouting , “ Ron Paul would grow it , ” to which Graham retorted , “ We ’re not going to be the Ron Paul party . ”
“ We ’re not going to be the party of angry white guys , ” said Graham .

During a subsequent CNN segment , Ron Paul responded to Graham by asking him why he has abandoned traditional conservative principles by supporting big government , renewing the Patriot Act , TARP funds , as well as Obama ’s expansion of the war in Afghanistan .
“ What does he have against the Constitution ? ” asked Paul .
“ For him to say that everybody who is upset with the government and upset with his type of voting record are ‘ angry white men ’ – that is preposterous , that is a real insult , ” said Paul , adding that the people who attended his rallies were from diverse backgrounds .
Paul slammed Graham for supporting Obama ’s expansion of the war by “ urging him on to do more and more , ” when in fact “ we have no right to be there and we need to bring our troops home , ” according to the Congressman .

Any regulations that would prohibit Internet service providers from managing their networks , they said , would discourage those companies from investing the billions of dollars needed to expand broadband access .

“ We believe that network neutrality regulations would actually thwart further broadband investment and availability , and that a well - reasoned broadband plan would confirm our view , ” the pair wrote in the letter .
“ So to hastily begin the process of adopting network neutrality rules months before issuing such a plan implies that politics are driving the FCC ’s decision - making process .
” Last week , FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski proposed strengthening the agency ’s current guidelines on net neutrality by formally adopting them as regulation .
He also proposed two additional rules , including one aimed at preventing Internet companies from discriminating against any traffic to certain types of content or services .
In other words , all traffic would have to be treated the same .
Net neutrality was a cornerstone of Obama ’s technology priorities during his campaign .
Genachowski , his top campaign tech adviser , was a key architect behind those plans .
Major broadband providers such as AT&T , Verizon and Comcast have argued that the agency ’s existing guidelines are sufficient and that no additional regulations are needed .
They have also said some network management practices are needed in order to make sure broadband services reliably reach all their customers .
and Cantor said broadband investment would be in jeopardy if the FCC “ micromanages ” network management .
“ As Americans wade through the current economic situation , a decision by the FCC to discourage broadband investment would be irresponsible , ” they said .
“ The United States needs broadband providers to increase investment and create jobs .
This will not occur if broadband providers are saddled with unnecessary , burdensome requirements that interfere with their ability to manage their networks and create innovative broadband products that maximize consumer choice and benefit .
” Markham Erickson , executive director of the Open Internet Coalition , responded that the net neutrality issue has been under debate for more than four years and that the previous Republican administration also took steps to prevent Internet companies from discriminating against certain types of traffic .
“ To suggest this is a radical policy u-turn is simply incorrect , ” Erickson said in a statement .
“ In fact , it is critical to investment that this issue be addressed sooner rather than later — further delay in addressing this core policy issue will harm investment flows into new and innovative technologies .
” Gigi Sohn , president of Public Knowledge , pointed out that Obama supported Genachowski ’s move to formalize net neutrality principles .
"
Net Neutrality is simply a guarantee of fairness , a prohibition on discrimination , ” she said .
“ Telephone , cable and wireless companies will still manage their networks and will still invest as they wish .
Putting the telephone , cable and wireless companies in control of the content , however , is a recipe for economic disaster . ”

The trio met on the social networking website Facebook Detectives have pledged to try to identify the children abused by a Plymouth nursery worker .
Vanessa George pleaded guilty , along with Angela Allen and Colin Blanchard , to a string of child sex offences in a case described by police as " devilish " .
The judge urged George , who met the others online , to do the " decent thing " and name children she had assaulted .
A spokeswoman for the parents of children who went to the nursery said " they were sick to the stomach " .
Detective Inspector Costa Nassaris from Devon and Cornwall Police says despite repeated questioning , George had refused to disclose their identities .
The probability I would have to say is very low that we will identify any of these children

Chilling bond between abusers ' I can't believe how evil she is '
Spotlight on abusers " We 've interviewed her four or five times , and we 've made it a priority of ours to ask her about the identification of the victims but at this stage she has n't given us the name of any child , " he said .
" ... the judge has done everything he possibly can to make it quite clear to her that he expects her to provide the information which she must have . "
He said experts had been unable to identify any of the children filmed by George because of the " nature of the images themselves " .
" Work is ongoing , we 've not given up on that but the probability I would have to say is very low that we will identify any of these children , " he warned .
Parents ' spokeswoman Kathy Hancock said George , who had worked at Little Ted 's nursery in the Efford area of Plymouth for three years , was a " well - liked member of the community " .
" She was very friendly with the parents , she would babysit for them in their homes , and she was in a position of trust that she completely violated , " she said .

Children 's Secretary Ed Balls said it was a " deeply distressing and disturbing case " and he expected the serious case review to be completed as soon as possible .
George , Allen and Blanchard , all 39 , met via the social networking site Facebook .
They had never met in person before appearing at Bristol Crown Court on Thursday .
They are due to be sentenced next month .
About 30 parents wept in court as the guilty pleas were entered .
Allen cried as she pleaded guilty while Blanchard showed no reaction and George hung her head in the dock .
The abuse began in September last year and the three were arrested in June following a police investigation involving officers from the forces in Devon and Cornwall , Nottinghamshire and Greater Manchester .
' Horrific and devilish '
The assaults were recorded on mobile phones and the trio shared images via e-mail and text messages .
George admitted seven sexual assaults and six counts of distributing and making indecent pictures of children .
IT worker Blanchard , from Rochdale , pleaded guilty to 17 child pornography counts and two sexual assaults on children .
Allen , from Nottingham , pleaded guilty to four child sex assaults and one count of distributing an indecent image .
Child abuse is far more commonplace than most people comprehend - [ studies suggest ] the involvement of women is significantly under - reported
Mark Easton , BBC home editor
Mark Easton 's blog Detective Superintendent Adrian Pearson , of Nottinghamshire Police , said the trio had been guilty of child abuse in its most " horrific and devilish form " .
" Those three individuals have shared quite willingly and freely images , texts , fantasies of the most serious level you could imagine , " he said .
Ann Reddrop , from the Crown Prosecution Service , said their crimes were beyond comprehension .
" These three individuals each acted in a way which ordinary people will find hard to understand , " she said .
" They showed total disregard for the lives of their victims , their own families and those they worked with , all of whom have been left devastated by these crimes . "
Judge John Royce , who adjourned sentencing for reports , warned the three abusers they faced substantial prison sentences .

He said the " decent " thing for George to do would be to co-operate with police in identifying all the abuse victims in the photographs .
Speaking to George 's lawyer , the judge said : " Your client must know it seems to me who she has abused and who she has not .
If I were a parent , I would want to know whether my child was abused or not . "
It is not known when the three first met but Detective Inspector Tony Creely , of Greater Manchester Police 's sexual crime unit , said they " were as bad as each other " .
" Blanchard , George and Allen sent thousands of messages between each of them .
Blanchard expressed love for each of the women , and they would reciprocate , " he said .
" They would discuss sexual matters of a crude and gross nature and the abuse of children in the texts and e-mails .
" All of them were getting gratification from the texts and seeing who could have the worst idea . "

The ranks of the world 's hungry has surpassed one billion , and declining aid and investment in agriculture are expected to steadily increase the number of undernourished people for more than a decade , according to a United Nations food agency report .
Unless these trends are reversed , ambitious goals set by the international community to slash the number of hungry people by 2015 will not be met , the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization warned in its annual State of Food Insecurity report , which was released on Wednesday .
Food and Agriculture Organization director general Jacques Diouf speaks at the organization 's headquarters in Rome .
( ( Pier Paolo Cito / Associated Press ) )
After gains in the fight against hunger in the 1980s and early 1990s , the number of undernourished people started climbing in 1995 , reaching 1.02 billion this year under the combined effect of high food prices and the global financial meltdown , the agency said .
The figure topped the one billion mark in June , and was 963 million a year ago .
The blame for the long - term trend rests largely on the reduced share of aid and private investments earmarked for agriculture over recent years , the Rome - based agency said .
" In the fight against hunger the focus should be on increasing food production , " FAO director general Jacques Diouf said .
" It 's common sense … that agriculture would be given the priority , but the opposite has happened . "
In 1980 , 17 per cent of aid contributed by donor countries went to agriculture .
That share was down to 3.8 per cent in 2006 and only slightly improved in the last three years , Diouf said .
Soaring prices
Economists said the decline may have been caused by low food prices that discouraged investment in agriculture and competition for funds from other aid fields including emergency relief , debt reduction and population control .
Hunger terms Undernutrition Results from prolonged low levels of food intake and / or low absorption of food consumed .
May also relate to vitamin and mineral deficiencies .
Undernourishment or chronic hunger Status of people who regularly consume less than their minimum energy requirements .
The average person requires a minimum of about 1,800 kcal per day .
Malnutrition
A range of conditions that hinder good health , caused by inadequate or unbalanced food intake or from poor absorption of food consumed .
It refers to both undernutrition ( food deprivation ) and overnutrition ( excessive food intake in relation to energy requirements ) .
Food security A country 's population has both physical and economic access to sufficient , safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs for an active and healthy life .
Food insecurity A country 's population does not have access to sufficient amounts of safe and nutritious food and therefore , is not consuming enough for an active and healthy life .
This can be caused by the unavailability of food , insufficient purchasing power or inappropriate utilization of resources at the household level .
Source : Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
Against the backdrop of this trend , the world 's hungry were hit with a double blow recently .
First , soaring prices for food staples in 2007 and 2008 forced poor families to sell their meagre assets and cut down on meals , health and education spending .
Although the inflated prices — which caused riots across the globe last year — have stabilized , they remain comparatively high , especially in the developing world , Diouf said .
In the meantime , the world economic crisis is increasing unemployment , reducing remittances that immigrants send back home and making it difficult for poor countries to get credit lines to buy food on the market , Diouf said .
Thirty countries now require emergency food assistance , including 20 in Africa .
FAO announced in June that the number of hungry people had reached one billion , or one in six of the world 's population .
The world 's most populous region , Asia and the Pacific , has the largest number of hungry people — 642 million — followed by Sub - Saharan Africa with 265 million .
" The current crisis is historically unprecedented " said the new report .
" With developing countries today more financially and commercially integrated into the world economy than they were 20 years ago , they are far more exposed to shocks in international markets . "
Investment needed
Diouf said world leaders are starting to understand that investment in agriculture must be increased .
He cited the goal set by July 's Group of Eight summit in L'Aquila , Italy , to raise $ 20 billion to help farmers in poor countries produce more — a shift from previous emphasis on delivering food aid .
However , more investments will be needed to fulfil pledges like the UN Millennium Development Goals , which aim to halve of the number of those living in hunger and poverty by 2015 , the report said .
FAO , which will host a world food summit next month , says global food output will have to increase by 70 per cent to feed a projected population of 9.1 billion in 2050 .
To achieve that , poor countries will need $ 44 billion yearly of aid to agriculture , compared with the current $ 7.9 billion , to increase access to irrigation systems and modern machinery , as well as to build roads and train farmers .

Have you ever worked on a project that was so unwieldy , you were scared to update a file or add a feature ?
Maybe the problem was that you were n't using a version control system .
In today 's tutorial , we 'll learn the basics of what might possibly be the best VCS in the world : Git .
What is Git ?
Git is a open - source code managemen tool ; it was created by Linus Torvalds when he was building the Linux kernel .
Because of those roots , it needed to be really fast ; that it is , and easy to get the hang of as well .
Git allows you to work on your code with the peace of mind that everything you do is reversible .
It makes it easy to experiment with new ideas in a project and not worry about breaking anything .
The Git Parable , by Tom Preston - Werner , is a great introduction to the terms and ideas behind Git .
Why Should I use Git ?
You should definitely use a revision control system ; as we already said , this gives you the freedom to do whatever you want with your code and not worry about breaking it .
So if you ’ve realized the benefits of using a revision control system , why should you use git ?
Why not SVN or Perforce or another one ?
To be honest , I have n't studied the differences too closely ; check out WhyGitIsBetterThanX.com for some helpful info .
How do I Get Set Up ?
Git is pretty easy to get : on a Mac , it ’s probably easiest to use the git - osx - installer .
If you have MacPorts installed , you may want to get Git through it ; you can find instructions on the GitHub help site .
( And yes , we ’ll talk about GitHub ) .
On Windows , the simplest way to start rolling is to use the msysgit installer .
However , if you ’ve got Cygwin , you can git Git through there as well .
How do I use Git ?
By now you should have Git installed ; if you ’re on a Mac , open up a terminal ; if you ’re on Windows open the Git Bash ( from msysgit ) or your Cygwin prompt .
From here on , there should n’t be any OS differences .
Configuration
We ’ll start by doing a bit of configuration .
Every commit you make will have your name and email address to identify the ‘ owner ’ of the commit , so you should start by giving it those values .
To do so , run these commands :
It 's also nice to enable some text coloring , just for easier reading in the terminal .
git init
Now that Git knows who you are , let ’s imagine we ’re creating a simple PHP web app .
( Of course , the bigger the project , the brighter Git shines , but we ’re just learning the tools , right ? )
We ’ve got an empty directory called ‘ mySite . ’
First focus on that directory ( using the cd command ) .
To get started with Git , you need to run the git init command ; as you might guess , this initializes a Git repository in that folder , adding a .git folder within it .
A repository is kind of like a code history book .
It will hold all the past versions of your code , as well as the current one .
Notice that your terminal path is appended with ( master ) .
That ’s the branch you ’re currently working on .
Branch ?
Think of your project as a tree ; you can create different features on different branches , and everything will stay separate and safe .
git add
We ’ve started working on our application .
Before we go any further , we should make our first commit .
A commit is simply a pointer to a spot on your code history .
Before we can do that , however , we need to move any files we want to be a part of this commit to the staging area .
The staging area is a spot to hold files for your next commit ; maybe you do n't want to commit all your current changes , so you put some in the staging area .
We can do that by using the add command
The . simply means to add everything .
You could be more specific if you wanted .
git commit
Now that we ’ve staged our files , let ’s commit them .
This is done with the command
This takes all the files in our staging area and marks that code as a point in our project ’s history .
If you do n’t add any options to the command above , you ’ll get something like this .
Each commit should have an accompanying message , so you know why that code was committed .
This editor allows you to write your message , as well as see what is in this commit .
From the image above , you can see that this commit is comprised of four new files .
The editor you ’re using to write the message is Vim ; if you ’re not familiar with vim , know that you ’ll need to press i ( for Insert ) before you can type your message .
In the shot above , I 've added the message " Initial Commit . "
After you write your message , hit escape and type :wq ( to save and exit ) .
You ’ll then see you ’re commit take place .
You can use a few options to make commits more quickly .
Firstly , -m allows you to add your message in - line .
Then , - a allows you to skip the staging area ; well , not really .
Git will automatically stage and commit all modified files when you use this option .
( remember , it wo n’t add any new files ) .
Together , you could use these commands like this :
So how does Git tell commits apart ?
Instead of numbering them , Git uses the code contents of the commit to create a 40 character SHA1 hash .
The neat part about this is that , since it 's using the code to create the hash , no two hashes in your project will be the same unless the code in the commits is identical .
git status
The git status command allows you to see the current state of your code .
We ’ve just done a commit , so git status will show us that there ’s nothing new .
If we continue working on our imaginary project , you ’ll see that our status changes .
I ’m going to edit our index. php and add another file .
Now , running git status gives us this :
The update is divided into two categories : “ changed but not updated , ” and “ untracked files . ”
If we run
you ’ll see that we now have a “ changes to be committed ” section .
This lists files added to the staging area .
I ’m going to commit these changes with this :
Now running git status shows us a clean working directory .
git branch / git checkout
Here ’s a scenario : we ’re working happily on our project when suddenly we have a grand idea .
This idea is so revolutionary , it will change our project drastically .
We ’ve got to give it a try , but we do n’t want to throw this insecure , first - draft code in with our tested and true code .
What to do ?
This is where git branch will be immensely helpful .
Let ’s branch our project so that if our big idea does n’t work out , there ’s no harm done .
Just running the branch command sans options will list our branches ; right now , we ’ve only got the master branch , which is what any git repository starts with .
To actually create a new branch , add the name of your new branch after the command .
When you create a new branch , you are n’t switched to it automatically .
Notice that our terminal still says ( master ) .
This is where we use branches comrade command git checkout .
( Tip : you can create a branch and switch to it in one fell swoop with this command : git checkout - b branch name . )
As you can see , we ’re now on the bigIdea branch .
Let ’s code up a storm .
Git status will show our work .
Let ’s commit our changes :
All right , enough of this feature for now ; let ’s go back to our master branch ; but before we do , I want to show you our current project folder .
Now , switch back to the master branch ; you know how : git checkout master .
Look at our project folder again .
No , I did n’t do anything ; those two files are only part of the bigIdea branch , so we do n’t even know they exist from the master branch .
This not only works for complete files , but also for even the smallest changes within files .
git merge
Ok , so we ’ve been working hard on that bigIdea branch in our spare time .
In fact , after another commit , it ’s looking so sweet we ’ve decided it ’s good enough to join the master branch .
So how do we do it ?
The git merge command is made for exactly this purpose .
While on the master branch , give this a try :
It ’s that easy ; now , everything on the bigIdea branch is a part of the master branch .
You can get rid of the bigIdea branch now , if you want .
I should mention that if you have n’t merged a branch , Git wo n’t let you delete it with this command ; you ’ll need to use an uppercase D in the option .
This is just a safety measure .
git log / gitk
You ’ll probably want to look at your commit history at some point during your project .
This can easily be done with the log command .
This will output a list of all the commits you ’ve made in a project , showing them in reverse order .
You can get at quite a tidy chunk of info here :
the commit author
the commit hash
the date and time
the message
Definitely informative , but rather dry , no ?
We can brighten things a bit with the graph option .
Now we can see the tree structure , sort of .
Although we do n’t get their names , we can see each of the branches and which commits were made on them .
If you ’re used to working in a terminal , you might be fine with this .
However , if ( previous to this experience ) the word terminal strikes you first as something deadly , breathe easy : there ’s an app for that .
Try this :
This is the graphical repository browser .
You can browse around your commits , see exactly what was changed in each file during a commit , and so much more .
( You ’ll notice I added a few commits before merging , just to make the tree structure more recognizable . )
GitHub
Now that you ’ve got a reasonable knowledge of Git under your belt , let ’s look at some of the collaborative parts of Git .
Git is a great way to share code with others and work on projects together .
There are a number of Git repository hosting sites .
We ’ll just look at one : GitHub .
Head over to the GitHub sign - up page and create an account .
You ’ll need an SSH public key , so let ’s create that right now !
( Note : you do n’t need the key while signing up ; you can add it later . )
Open up your terminal and type this :
The t option assigns a type , and the C option adds a comment , traditionally your email address .
You ’ll then be asked where to save the key ; just hitting enter will do ( that saves the file to the default location ) .
Then , enter a pass - phrase , twice .
Now you have a key ; let ’s give it to GitHub .
First , get your key from the file ; the terminal will have told you where the key was stored ; open the file , copy the key ( be careful not to add any newlines or white - space ) .
Open your GitHub account page , scroll to SSH Public Keys , and click “ Add another public key . ”
Paste in your key and save it .
You ’re good to go !
You can test your authentication by running this :
You ’ll be prompted for your pass - phrase ; to avoid having to type this every time you connect to GitHub , you can automate this .
I could tell you how to do this , but I ’d probably inadvertently plagiarize : the GitHub Help has a plain - english article on how to do it .
Git Clone
So now you ’re set up with GitHub ; let ’s grab a project .
How about jQuery ?
If you go to the jQuery GitHub project , you ’ll find the git clone URL .
Run this :
This creates a jquery folder and copies the whole jquery repository to your computer .
Now you have a complete history of the project ; check it out with gitk –all .
git push
So let ’s say you ’ve been working on a project , managing it with git locally .
Now you want to share it with a friend , or the world .
Log into GitHub and create a new repository .
GitHub will give you a public clone URL ( for others wanting to download your project ) and a personal clone URL ( for yourself ) .
Then , come back to your project in the terminal and give this a whirl :
A remote is a project repository in a remote location .
In this case , we ’re giving this remote a name of origin , and handing it our private clone URL .
( Obviously , you will have to substitute my URL for your own . )
Now that the project knows where it ’s going . . .
This pushes the master branch to the origin remote .
Now you ’re project is available to the world !
Head back to your project page and see your project .
git pull
You might be on the other end of a project : you ’re a contributor instead of the owner .
When the owner pushes a new commit to the repository , you can use git pull to get the updates .
Git pull is actually a combo tool : it runs git fetch ( getting the changes ) and git merge ( merging them with your current copy ) .
You ’re Set !
Well , there ’s so much more you can learn about Git ; hopefully you ’ve learned enough commands to help you manage your next project more smartly .
But do n’t stop here ; check out these resources to become a Git master !

OTTAWA–The war between India and Pakistan spills over into Toronto 's immigrant suburbs .
A terrorist sleeper cell poisons Montreal 's water system .
Mandatory military service is enacted for young and new Canadians .
While the country 's politicians debate what Canada 's engagement in Afghanistan will look like after the current mission ends in 2011 , the military has already peered far past that date to determine its training and equipment needs and the worst - case scenarios it must prepare to face .
While the Armed Forces constantly project scenarios for which to train , these hypothetical situations are rarely publicized .
Although they appear far - fetched , the military is obliged to prepare for the worst , or risk being unready in the event of a catastrophe .
A 10 - year forecast completed for the air force lays out likely trends in areas such as oil prices and aviation technologies , but also a series of " strategic shocks " – unpredictable events that could throw the best - laid plans off course .
The report predicts that oil prices will have doubled , tripled or quadrupled by 2019 , unmanned attack aircraft will police the skies , and the Arctic will have become the zone of interest for the world 's great powers .
A lethal , all - commando Canadian army may not stay in Kandahar , but it will be fighting terrorists in a geographic rainbow known as the " arc of instability " – a region stretching from western Africa , through the Middle East and into Southeast Asia .
" These areas have also traditionally served as potential safe havens for terrorists in developing , organizing and preparing for asymmetric attacks against the developed world , " says the report , produced earlier this year by the Canadian Forces Aerospace Warfare Centre .
No more country - to - country wars for Canada .
Instead , soldiers will face shadowy enemies in weak or failed states with little regard for civilian safety .
" It is projected that irregular challenges , asymmetrical warfare , low - intensity conflicts and insurgencies will be the most prevalent form of conflict until 2019 . "
The report also explicitly probes Canada 's domestic fault lines – features like our shared border and trade ties with the United States or our large immigrant populations – and puts them up against some of the world 's most volatile disputes to offer scenarios showing how a largely peaceful society could be torn apart .
They include :
The introduction of national military service for new Canadians in 2016 to tackle large immigration flows and a depleted military .
War between India and Pakistan that sparks clashes in B.C. 's Lower Mainland and Ontario suburbs where refugee and immigrant populations from the two countries have settled .
A Taliban sleeper cell poisons the Montreal water system , killing and sickening thousands .
Hospitals are swamped , the U.S. border closes and tourism plummets .
A large - scale Canadian military deployment to Afghanistan in 2016 to ensure Canadian business has free access to protectionist U.S. markets .
The scenarios may seem improbable , but they all have some basis in reality : Canada 's dependence on the U.S. ; international terrorist ambitions ; simmering conflict in South Asia ; and a stagnant military .

A study by the University of Ottawa earlier this year looked at security threats to Canada in 2020 and came up with similar outcomes to those of the military .
In one , the Pakistani state collapses in 2016 and India moves in , appointing friendly politicians and establishing its own laws .
Protests eventually give way to riots in " Little Toronto , " where Indians and Pakistanis live side - by - side .
" Fundamentalist feelings have flared up , opening the door to terrorist organizations and the recruitment of new members , " says the April study .
The military 's scenarios may be conceivable , but there 's no evidence they are likely to occur , said Paul Robinson , a University of Ottawa professor and former military intelligence officer who helped design the dystopian outcomes for the University of Ottawa study .
" Scenario building is never desperately scientific in the sense that you are engaging in fantasy , but you can engage in fantasy in a more solidly grounded basis , " he said .
In his opinion , the air force 's strategic shocks are less grounded in scientific method than in the politics of a military bureaucracy competing for money .
" I suspect it 's in an air force report because it makes you scared , and if it makes you scared you 'll spend more on defence , " he said .
" That 's just my cynical view . "
The air force report cites various Canadian and British military studies to come up with its forecasts , as well as an official Air Force Strategy paper and the " vision of the Chief of the Air Staff . "
As for the flying wing of the Canadian Forces , the future lies in the North and high in the skies .
With climate change , melting Arctic ice and the possibility of up to 80 per cent of the global transportation market moving through Canadian waterways , the air force plans to better protect Canadian territory , deter unfriendly visitors and rescue those in trouble in the unforgiving territory .
Dwindling global fuel stocks , and unstable oil prices , also make it more likely that the pilots of the future will have two feet on the ground , controlling surveillance and attack drones by remote control .
It 's unlikely the air force will ever purchase another fighter jet to replace its CF - 18s , the report says .
" In the future , smaller , cheaper and expendable unmanned combat aerial vehicles ... will have unsurpassable advantages over manned platforms in both performance and costs . "

The Beatles are generally considered the greatest musical group of all time .
Considering their musical library has yet to hit iTunes , I ’d say it ’s also one of the hardest licenses to get a hold of , and yet EA and Harmonix has done just that .
Almost a year after releasing Rock Band 2 – which is still powerful enough a platform to give the constant Guitar Hero releases a run for their money – The Beatles : Rock Band promises to capture the spirit of the band throughout its tenure .
Minus the drugs , public scrutiny , and of course , Ono .
[ Thus fulfilling my contractual obligation to mention her at least once in the review . ]
The first thing any avid player of the first two Rock Band games will notice is the graphical overhaul .
The presentation has been the game ’s main selling point , and rightfully so .
Story Mode offers the chance to follow the band from its early start in The Cavern to the final roof top performance , passing Ed Sullivan and Abbey Road along the way .
Each “ chapter ” captures the era of the band identically in appearance while keeping with a cartoony atmosphere fitting of the whimsical attitude which helped propel the band .
In terms of allowing the player to feel as if they are a part of the band , you ’d be hard pressed to find a developer that could do it better .
Watching The Beatles grow as musicians is surprisingly entrancing .
Starting with the relatively simple grooves found in the album “ Please Please Me , ” to the mature musicianship found in “ Abbey Road ” and “ Let It Be ” .
Not to knock their earlier work ; the catchy melodies still stand up today despite the poor quality due to the equipment from the early 1960s .
But without their later work the band would have faded into oblivion like so many other groups of the time .
The best feature of the game , by far , is the “ music video ” style songs provided during the Abbey Road era .
Harmonix saw the band ’s absence from the tour scene as an opportunity , and rather than have the audience stuck in the small recording studio , they opted to bring the songs to life with visceral masterpieces .
From playing on the ocean floor amidst a yellow submarine to the hot air balloon ride found on “ With A Little Help From My Friends , ” I found myself missing notes as my gaze followed the background .
However , these unique settings do n’t allow customizable performances .
For instance , you ca n’t play ‘ Yellow Submarine ’ on the Ed Sullivan Show .
This required change in scenery means a feature introduced to Guitar Hero last year , no loading between songs , is absent .
While a historically accurate and colorful feature , there is little doubt that the novelty will wear off before long .
Unfortunately , the game suffers greatly from the lack of songs .
Of The Beatles ’ library of over 250 songs , only 45 appear in the game .
Among the most noticeable songs missing : Across the Universe , Let It Be , Love Me Do , and Yesterday .
Meanwhile , over thirty songs are slated for release this year at two dollars a pop .
It ’s hard to argue for the $ 60 entrance fee when another sixty will be needed before Christmas .
Unless you are a diehard fan , I ’m not entirely convinced it ’s worth it .
In fact , much of the game seems to be fan service .
In Story Mode , doing well nets behind the scenes pictures , and collecting pictures unlocks videos .
For the average fan , this is hardly an attention holder .
The Beatles : Rock Band seems to have trouble deciding if it ’s there to appease Beatles fans or to provide another notch on the belt of the music game genre just as it reaches the precipice dividing a cool novelty and an oversaturated part of the new mass market gaming industry .
There is little doubt that the game will at least introduce a new generation to the rock group .
Many of which may not be aware that they are already fans .
After all , it ’s nearly impossible to go through a day without encountering something influenced by them .
Anyone who owns Rock Band 2 knows that one of the strongest appeals is the sheer number of song choices .
Especially if you imported the songs from its predecessor and downloaded a few tracks from the vast number of options online .
It ’s easy to play for long jam sessions with a wide variety of sounds and genres without repeating a song twice .
This is where The Beatles : Rock Band fails .
It is by no means the first game to focus on a single rock group , and while it handles its limited content well , it brings nothing new to the genre .
Sessions are short lived and feel redundant .
One band can only feel fresh for so long .
An average sitting consists of playing a few of your favorite songs and then a few songs you more than likely would n’t play if there were more choices .
Music games are so simple , it ’s one of the few places where quantity over quality counts .
A larger selection of both original songs and the incalculable number covers could have made the game go from good to mind blowing .
I suggest this was more greed on the part of The Beatles ’ side of the deal rather than Harmonix , but it ’s still inexcusable .
Jon Stewart , International Man of News
Just landed in the U.K. for a quick bout of pre-release publicity for SuperFreakonomics .
Checked in at the hotel , turned on the TV to unpack , flipped through the channels , and came to CNN .
I was expecting to see a familiar face , and I did .
But not Wolf , not Campbell , not Larry : instead , it ’s Jon Stewart .
Yes , it turns out that CNN International airs a “ global edition ” of The Daily Show .
Apparently this has been going on for several years , but I never knew .
If , as alleged , a lot of U.S. viewers consider Stewart their chief source of the news when he’s on Comedy Central , just imagine what international viewers think when they find him on CNN .
Maybe so many people around the world disliked President Bush based on what they saw of him on TDS ?
Does the Norwegian Nobel Committee , e.g. , know that it is not an actual news program ?
[ Addendum : Having read some of the comments below , I must conclude that I am a horrible writer or some of you cannot take a joke .
Or perhaps both ? ]
More children equal more carbon dioxide emissions .
And recent research has resulted in renewed coverage of the notion that one of the cheapest ways to curb emissions in coming decades would be to provide access to birth control for tens of millions of women around the world who say they desire it .
A study by researchers at the London School of Economics and commissioned by the Optimum Population Trust came to the following conclusion :
Contraception is ‘ Greenest ’ Technology U.N. data suggest that meeting unmet need for family planning would reduce unintended births by 72 per cent , reducing projected world population in 2050 by half a billion to 8.64 billion .
Between 2010 and 2050 12 billion fewer “ people - years ” would be lived – 326 billion against 338 billion under current projections .
The 34 gigatons of CO2 saved in this way would cost $ 220 billion – roughly $ 7 a ton [ metric tons ] .
However , the same CO2 saving would cost over $ 1 trillion if low - carbon technologies were used .
( Here ’s a link to a pdf of the report . )
I recently raised the question of whether this means we ’ll soon see a market in baby - avoidance carbon credits similar to efforts to sell CO2 credits for avoiding deforestation .
This is purely a thought experiment , not a proposal .
But the issue is one that is rarely discussed in climate treaty talks or in debates over United States climate legislation .
If anything , the population - climate question is more pressing in the United States than in developing countries , given the high per-capita carbon dioxide emissions here and the rate of population growth .
If giving women a way to limit family size is such a cheap win for emissions , why is n’t it in the mix ?
A related story from the archives .
In a world where metal music has turned to pop and its high pitched yells have turned to boy band hell , you ’re one of the last few with metal in their soul .
Your name ?
Eddie Riggs and you ’re one of the best roadies left in a musically deprived world .
You start off backstage while the band is ready to start the show .
As you hand the guitarist with the Kabbage Boy shirt his guitar , you realize that the music you once knew and loved is long gone .
Dead .
As the band hits the stage , the guitarist decides to climb the beast decoration .
During this scene , you ’re given the option to censor out bad language just as Eddie is about to drop the F - bomb .
In an obvious turn of events , the guitarist falls , you ’re there to save him , and you disappear into the darkness .
Before you know it , a huge piece of steel slab falls on you , crushing you to death .
As blood pours out of your metal body and leaks down into your metal belt , out of metal hell comes a metal beast ( literally ) and releases a metal wave of destruction upon the non-metal ; decapitating them … assuming you ’re ok with gore .
Yeah , this game is metal !
You wake up to see a group of cult demons around an Axe in the center of the stage , which you will later realize is positioned atop a tower of death and despair !
After an exchange of hilarious dialogue , you ’re able to move around freely .
Avoid picking up the Axe so you can hear the lines of Eddie .
I found them hilarious .
Your first obvious objective is to pick up the Axe , which goes by the name of The Separator , all the while avoiding the evil cult of evil hell !
Once you pick up the Axe , which is controlled by the A button , a couple of basic moves become available .
Tapping
A will give you a light attack , while pressing and holding will give you a strong attack that will strike your opponent so hard it will decapitate them .
Metal style !
Just after picking up the Axe and defeating a couple of drones , you pick up another Axe , this time it ’s a guitar and it ’s named Clementine .
The guitar also comes with a set of moves that are attached to the X button .
Just like the Axe , you have a light and strong attack .
Using both A and X gives you an AOE ( area of effect ) attack where it pushes away nearby enemies .
As you progress , more moves become available and both can be put into play for massive damage .
The Left Trigger is reserved for targeting enemies .
While targeted , moving the right analog stick will toggle between who you want to target .
The B button is for blocking while the Y is reserved for picking up objects or action commands .
The Right Trigger is for selecting solos that you can shred with your guitar .
More on that later …
Half way through the demo , you meet a female character that was also seeking Clementine .
You team up with her to reek metal mayhem and learn moves in which you partner up to cause even more damage !
Immediately after , you come across something known as Relic Raiser .
It ’s “ A rare vine that grows wherever the land is steeped in legend . ”
Press the Right Trigger near a vine and select the Relic Raiser solo to begin .
You have to press the corresponding button when necessary .
It ’s similar to music games of today .
Once you rock that solo , a cut scene plays in which you put your roadie skills to work and build a vehicle that you lovingly name “ The Deuce ” or “ The Druid Plow . ”
Once in the vehicle , the Left Trigger is used to go in reverse while the Right Trigger is to accelerate .
B is for sharp turns and clicking in the Left analog is for nitro which will be used to defeat the boss which was quite easy .
The short vehicle section was fairly easy .
Just drive forward while running over anything you see in sight .
When you reach your destined location and defeat a couple more cult demons , a huge skeletal creature appears and , you guessed it , boss battle time !
You just have to circle around the vagina with teeth looking beast and avoid its attacks .
Once it misses , you have to nitro boost into its tentacles that got stuck to the ground .
After that , you ’re done with the demo .
Short and sweet …
The demo , while linear and fairly easy , got me hooked and wanting more metal mishaps .
The sound track alone should please every metal head out there and if metal is n’t your style , the story and dialogue should be enough to keep you entertained .
The game play itself falls a little short in the demo but I ’m sure it ’ll expand as you dwell deeper into the wonderful metal world that Tim Shafer has created .
I ’m looking forward to picking this up come October 13 and I recommend you do the same .
In fact , we here a Couch Campus will take it a step further and provide the link as to where to reserve it !
Here you go and rock on !
Photos : The Life of Nomads in Iran
10/20/09
Photos by Raouf Mohseni , Mehr News Agency
Nomadic people are communities of people who move from one place to another , rather than settling permanently in one location .
There are an estimated 30 - 40 million nomads in the world .
Many cultures have traditionally been nomadic , but traditional nomadic behavior is increasingly rare in industrialized countries .
By 1920 nomadic pastoral tribes were over a quarter of Iran 's population .
Tribal pastures were nationalized during the 1960s .
The National Commission of UNESCO registered the population of Iran at 21 million in 1963 , of whom two million ( 9.5 % ) were nomads .
Although the nomadic population of Iran has dramatically decreased in the 20th century , Iran still has one of the largest nomadic populations in the world , an estimated 1.5 million in a country of about 70 million .
Modern Warfare 2 , of course , done stepped in it with the dedicated - server thing .
CVG talked with a producer and got less - than - assuring answers that Alien vs. Predator PC will support dedicated boxes , too .

In an interview with the Rebellion senior producer David Brickley , CVG pointedly mentioned that " There 's been a lot of controversy this month surrounding Modern Warfare 2 and its ditching of PC dedicated server , " and " Historically AvP is obviously a big PC game .
How are you making sure you support the PC version and keep your community happy ?

Replied Brickley :
This is a title that we want to support for a long time to come .
If it 's not been announced yet then certainly the PC version will benefit from Direct X 11 features .
That 's one thing we can use to make sure that people who invest in the hardware will get the absolute best .

Uhm , yes , but the question was about dedicated servers , right ?
CVG pressed on with :
And it was originally a PC title so you can imagine the heritage and the need within Rebellion itself to make sure that people who still play and talk of that game are not left behind .
And are you guys going to have those dedicated servers the community so clearly expects ?

Replied Brickley :
Well the one thing we can say is obviously running an operation like that is monumentally expensive .
For the period the original was up , people who played that game got an incredible experience .
You know what the internet 's like .
We 're obviously used to getting things for free over the years .
I guess on our side the thing we 're focusing on is whatever your set - up at home , you get the best possible experience from it .
We 're just trying to use our time and resources wisely .

We think we 've got our answer here , but just to get it for the record , CVG asks :
CVG : So is that a yes or a no on the dedicated servers ?
Brickley :
As I said the game is still quite a way from release so I guess there are other things to be determined during that time .

Given three opportunities to talk about it , we 'll take that as a " no . "
Interview : Aliens vs. Predator [ CVG ]
From Countdown , Keith walks us through the crazy - train that is the Glenn Beck show .
Olbermann :
The comfort of today 's mythical , homespun , aw - shucks , totalitarian , Lonesome Rhodes Glenn Beck is that every day he gives away the essential truth that he is ... an idiot .
If you 're going to warn the colonists that the English have arrived in the bay , you 're not going to get very far by jumping onto a horse and yelling , the " brutish are coming !
the brutish are coming ! "
If you try to tell Mr. Chambers that the alien book to serve man is not about helping people , but eating them , you kind of lose your credibility if you say , " Mr. Chambers , do n't get on that ship !
The rest of the book to serve man , it 's a phone book ! " .
Here 's Mr. Beck last week with the zeal of Paul Revere , and the panic of Mr. Chambers ' assistant cryptographer Pat and the spelling ability of a third grader .

Ah ... I gotta ' question .
Do n't you rehearse ?
' Oligarhy ? '
Or , did Obama steal the letter " C " ?!
Five Sydney men who embraced violent jihad have been found guilty of plotting a terrorist attack on Australian soil , after a 10 - month trial .
The men , aged between 25 and 44 , have been in custody for nearly four years , since they and four others were arrested in south - west Sydney in 2005 .
The five did n't react when the verdict was handed down today but it sparked angry scenes outside the purpose - built high - security court at Parramatta , in western Sydney , when supporters shouted and swore while watching on a screen outside .
During the 10 - month trial , the court heard the five jihadists wanted to terrify and intimidate the Australian public and Government in retaliation for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The Crown argued each of the men had been a party to stockpiling chemicals to make explosives and had " step - by - step instructions on how to make bombs capable of causing large - scale death and destruction . "
It was the prosecution case that the men had been in pursuit of " violent jihad which involved the application of extreme force and violence , including the killing of those who did not share the fundamentalist ... extremist , beliefs . "
It can now be revealed the other four men arrested in 2005 pleaded guilty and have already been sentenced for their role in the conspiracy to commit a terrorist attack .
No direct evidence
The prosecution has never told the court what the supposed target for the alleged terrorist attack was .
The jury heard from 300 witnesses , examined 3,000 exhibits , watched 30 days of surveillance tapes and listened to 18 hours of phone intercepts ; however , there was no direct evidence linking the accused to the terrorism plot .
Weapons were found in the south - west Sydney home of the accused ringleader , along with enough ammunition to keep firing for 37 hours .
Prosecutors said three of the accused had gone on paramilitary - style camps in far western New South Wales to prepare for an attack .
The defence claimed the men were just hunting , camping and having fun .
The jury was also told that one of the accused had attended a paramilitary training camp in Pakistan run by the terrorist organisation , Lashkar - e - Toiba , but a key FBI witness told the court he could not be sure it was the man .
Over 16 months , the men used false names to acquire mobile phones and spoke in code , aware they were under surveillance .
They were also equipped with night - vision cameras and had " large quantities of literature which supported indiscriminate killing , mass murder and martyrdom . "
Each of the accused possessed similar extremist material on their home computers , on topics including the September 11 attacks and ritual beheadings .
The Crown said they were influenced by the teachings of the Mujahadeen : " You kill us , we kill you ... you bomb us , so we bomb you . "
The judge , Justice Anthony Whealy , concluded it was the defence case that the men's views were , " commonly held by many in the Australian Muslim community . "
He told the jurors to put aside their prejudice and remember the Muslim faith was not on trial .
Trial almost aborted
The trial was almost derailed when it was revealed a relative of one of the accused had been coming to court , following the jurors to their cars and allegedly taking down detailed descriptions .
The defence called for the jury to be dismissed and the trial aborted over the young woman 's surveillance .
But the jurors said the revelation would not affect their deliberations and the judge gave the green light for the trial to continue .
The woman told police she had acted entirely on her own .
The 23 - day deliberation period was one of the longest in Australian legal history .
There were eight months of pre-trial arguments even before the trial got under way .
A raft of applications by the Crown and defence meant Justice Whealy had to deliver 65 judgements before a jury was even empanelled , including a raft of non-publication and suppression orders .
He wrote 100 in total .
This is a real world situation that could impact each of you as professionals , investors , and friends of persons who could fall for such schemes .
So please get angry about it !
An envelope arrived yesterday from a worried investor ( not a client of mine ) in Appleton , Wisconsin .
He had been contacted with an “ investment partner ” opportunity touting a “ guaranteed investment program ” that would absolutely “ double and triple his money every sixty days ” with no worries , work , or risk involved .
So why was this total stranger contacting me ?
Inside the envelope were four separate documents : ( 1 ) a call for twenty - five new investors who would become partners in this special , private , guaranteed investment program , and ( 2 ) an endorsement of the program from Helen Taylor , the founder of ResponseLink Pros , Inc .
Read
(3) An acceptance letter from Chris Jenkins , Advertising Manager of Moyer Direct , Inc. , the investment management company , and ( 4 ) a special offer coupon that allowed the new partners to make additional deposits of fewer dollars while promising an even greater rate of return .
So why was this total stranger sending this information to me ?
Two of the documents were fraudulently attributed to me and had been signed by someone using my name — bet that got your attention !
In the others , a fictitious Helen Taylor claimed to be my good friend and mentoring student while a non-existent Advertising Manager ( Chris Jenkins ) was distributing “ one - time - only ” discount offers that I was making in my capacity as president of Moyer Direct , Inc. — a company I had never heard of until yesterday .
Obviously , this scam artist ( the now indicted Wayne C. Scott a / k / a Chris Harper ) was able to paint a believable picture by trading on the good names , reputations , and achievements of well - known people in the financial industry .
I would guess that I ’m not the only one who has been unknowingly abused by such con artists .
And that is probably why I was n’t contacted by anyone until now .
Was your name used on documents sent to other victims ?
Did you sign up for a Warren Buffet or Ben Graham program ?
Court documents ( US District Court , Northern District of Illinois ) indicate that Wayne Scott has bilked hundreds of small investors to the tune of nearly one million dollars .
Other prominent investors , advisors , experts , and financial writers have probably had their reputations compromised as well .
Please forward this warning to your friends , colleagues , clients , relatives , and employees .
We need to prevent such scams from spreading any further
So why have n’t we ( and the investing public ) been warned about this outrage by someone official ?
Hmmm .

A company producing swine flu vaccine for Britain has paid millions of pounds in out - of - court settlements after being accused of fraudulently overcharging for medicines .
Baxter , the US pharmaceutical giant , reached at least seven huge settlements over the past 12 months , some of them for millions of dollars .
The company had been accused of fraud amid allegations that it had overpriced medicines by as much as 1,300 % .
The disclosure comes days after Baxter 's vaccine , Celvapan H1N1 , was given approval by the European Medicines Agency and will raise fears about the growing costs of the swine flu pandemic .
Vaccines are expected to cost the government £ 155 m over the next four years .
Baxter became involved in prolonged litigation after being accused of fraudulently overcharging Medicaid , the US health programme that provides a safety net for the poorest families .
Executives from the company paid out $ 2 m to the Kentucky state government this year .
Jack Conway , the Kentucky attorney general , said : " All of this could have been easily avoided if Baxter … had done what the law requires : report truthful prices .
" Taxpayers are footing the bill for these inflated drug prices , and my office is seeking to recover the money the Medicaid programme lost as a result of this deception and overpayment . "
Medicaid relies on published average wholesale prices ( AWPs ) to calculate the cost of medicines which pharmaceutical companies then provide at a reduced rate .
But several US states have accused a series of pharmaceutical companies of grossly overinflating the AWPs .
Seven other states have reached settlements with Baxter : Texas , Alabama , California , Hawaii , Alaska , Illinois and Wisconsin .
In May , Baxter was one of six pharmaceutical manufacturers that agreed to pay $ 89 m to the state of Alabama .
In February this year Baxter paid out $ 1.1 m to Wisconsin .
Three years ago the company agreed to pay out $ 8.5 m to Texas .
Baxter was one of five companies that paid California state authorities $ 22.5 m following accusations of Medicaid fraud , and the company also paid out $ 400,000 to Hawaii .
In Alaska , Baxter agreed to pay compensation to settle a court claim .
The company is also facing court action in Mississippi .
Illinois has recovered $ 6.8 m from Baxter , according to reports .
Despite the scandal , Baxter was one of two companies awarded the contract to produce 132 million doses of vaccine for Britain .
The other company , GlaxoSmithKline , received a " positive opinion " for its drug , Pandemrix , last month .
Britain is reported to have ordered enough swine flu vaccine to give each person two doses .
The growing cost of the vaccines has prompted concerns from politicians , but the Department of Health and the drug companies have declined to say exactly how much each vaccine costs .
Norman Lamb , the Liberal Democrat health spokesman , wrote to the National Audit Office in July asking whether the contract with GSK represented value for money .
The National Audit Office has replied and is broadly happy with the deal , according to reports .
Sir Liam Donaldson , the government 's chief medical officer , said that while swine flu could still cause potentially fatal complications Britain may have had a " lucky break " with a second wave of illness being lower than expected .
A spokeswoman for Baxter said that similar settlements with US states have been paid out by many other US drug companies and arose because of the unusual purchasing system employed by the Medicare system .
" Baxter was in no way trying to defraud the system and has acted in a responsible , lawful and transparent manner .
We will continue to work closely with the British authorities , " she said .
I am feeling confused and stupid , not normal states of mind for me .
The world is making elaborate preparations to protect itself against a disease that has killed 3,500 people and nobody is batting an eyelid ?
In a world where many more routinely die from a lack of clean drinking water , we are prepared to roll out a global vaccination drive for a disease that mostly presents with mild symptoms and nobody thinks it ’s odd ?
I wonder why nobody is questioning the numbers being bandied about and why we are all accepting the lies that are being dished out in the name of saving humanity from H1N1 .
Happily , seeing as I am not employed by a newspaper and free to share my views , I would like to shine some light on things that have been bothering me .
On April 4 , the World Health Organisation started reporting on a new form of influenza that had probably come from pigs and infected several hundred people .
Subsequently , daily updates tracked how quickly the H1N1 infection was travelling through the world and killing hundreds .
The term ‘ swine flu ’ was retracted after a while because the virus was found to be an odd ‘ cocktail ’ of viruses , containing six genes from the swine flu virus H1N1 , but also some from various strains of influenza virus seen in birds and humans .
Researchers now claim the strange mix of virus strains could only have occurred in a research laboratory , and there is even a public litigation suit filed by a Jane Burgermeister who has proof that 72 kilos of this ‘ virus ’ was actually shipped to various ports by Baxter to start this entire hullabaloo .
Getting back to the story , the hysteria whipped up by alarming new numbers on a daily basis has scared several governments into ordering millions of H1N1 vaccines and the FDA into bypassing crucial testing checkpoints to approve new vaccinations in a matter of months .
Again , Burgermeister claims to have proof that the vaccine was patented by Baxter in 2007 , much before the virus was known .
Also , the efficacy of any vaccine against a virus is dubious because the organism keeps mutating .
In the UAE , 3.2 million vials have been ordered and mandatory vaccinations are set to be rolled out for schoolchildren when shipments are received some time in October .
Fortunately , His Highness Shaikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum ’s Facebook page gives the average Joe a platform to reach out to powers that be , and a discussion board has been created asking him to give us the choice to refuse vaccinations for our children .
There are enough links out there to several independent studies and Youtube videos .
Anybody who wants to educate himself / herself can see the overwhelming evidence that the H1N1 scare is a ruse , and that the vaccinations may in fact be more dangerous than the virus .
First of all , let ’s get some perspective on the actual damage being done by the disease .
Since the WHO started reporting on H1N1 deaths on April 4 , about 3,500 people had died across the world as on September 18 .
According to the Canadian Medical Association , seasonal influenza routinely kills an average of 36,000 Americans and 2,500 Canadians each year in North America alone .
Australia ’s minister of health for Queensland Paul Lucas has also called for a rational media response , saying regular flu kills about 1,000 to 3,000 Australians each year , where 200 have succumbed to H1N1 this year .
Yet the WHO Director General Margaret Chan declared it a pandemic level 5 – level 6 being the highest – claiming that ‘ large - scale disease ’ was imminent .
This was on April 29 , when 129 people had died from H1N1 .
On the same day , Prof Paul Ferguson , leading the WHO task force on H1N1 , predicted that ultimately 40 per cent of global population would contract the disease .
Really ?
Three billion people would fall sick with a disease that 129 had succumbed to ?
On what basis were these dramatic predictions made ?
Whatever their motivations for these dire warnings , I believe we owe it to ourselves to educate ourselves and find ways of protecting our loved ones and countrymen .
For one , several studies have directly linked vaccinations to the outbreak of diseases like AIDS , autism and all kinds of cancer .
For those who ’d like to delve , there are papers to this effect that have been ignored by the medical fraternity for obvious reasons .
If that is too heavy a read , Youtube also has several interviews with guilt - ridden vaccine researchers who ’ve resigned from their jobs to give media interviews confirming that pharmaceutical companies are aware of vaccinations ’ connection with autoimmune diseases , but keep touting these money - spinning ‘ essential drugs ’ to Third world countries in the name of aid .
In some cases — like small pox — doctors admit they recommend vaccinations despite their inherent risks because not taking a vaccine could result in death .
However , in the case of H1N1 , this is not the case because the largest majority of people who contract it suffer mild symptoms .
There are some truths to the nature of H1N1 , sure .
It is highly contagious , for one .
The Communicable Diseases Centre ( CDC ) in Atlanta estimates that H1N1 must have touched about two million Americans by now .
However , of the several hundred thousand who fell sick , only about 2,000 died of the disease .
If only one in every thousand people who get the disease will die from it , why not focus on finding what is protecting the balance 999 ?
The fact is the human body has been designed to fight infections , it does so on a routine basis .
We have all fretted over our children when they were young and got a cold every second week .
But we ’ve also seen that as they grow older and their immune system matures , they do n’t fall sick as often because their bodies have developed antibodies to the germs in their environment along the way .
As long as we eat nourishing fresh foods , get plenty of rest and moderate amounts of exercise , we could — as I have — spend an entire lifetime away from hospitals .
And this is what I believe governments must support individuals on .
Vaccines , I believe , are invasive procedures ; they bypass the body ’s natural defence mechanisms and introduce bacteria straight into the blood stream : a bit like breaching a fortress and tunnelling under its wall to bomb the castle directly .
For any government to take away the right for people to participate in a decision affecting their bodies is wrong , and I hope all countries including the UAE will make the humane choice in this matter .

This series argues that there ’s an opportunity for some technology to become “ The Java of concurrent programming ” .
For background then , I ’ll try to capture the factors that led to Java ’s success as the first mainstream object - oriented platform for application developers .
[ This is part of the Concur . next series .
I ’d like to use this series as a sort of hub , so if you publish a substantial piece on the Java part of the concurrency metaphor , shoot me a link . ]
Good Engineering · Java is good .
I know that in AD2009 it ’s fashionable to sneer at its verbosity and boilerplate and generics and things like TransactionAwarePersistenceManagerFactoryProxy .
But if what you want is a statically - typed curly - braced highly - portable object - oriented programming platform , Java is a good one .
Free · I do n’t think this gets enough credit .
No computer programmer was ever asked for money in exchange for the use of Java .
This was probably Java ’s biggest competitive advantage against Smalltalk , which for many years you had to pay for if you wanted a decent version .
Libraries · Java came out of the gate with a pretty - big and not - too - bad set of libraries that hit an 80/20 point in meeting basic programmer needs .
This was an immense relief to anyone stuck in C++ STL hell .
Familiar · Java came with { and } and ++ and ; .
So the code , on first glance , was legible to the legions of C and C++ programmers , who , if they had any grasp at all of object - oriented thinking , could become competent Java developers in short order .
BigCo Backing ·
The fact that Sun was behind Java mattered .
In the early / mid Nineties , Sun shipped those glamorous workstations and nifty RISC processors and Unix and NFS and was totally down with the Net ; geek mojo out the ears , and also commercial respectability .
Which of These Was Most Important ?
· Missing any of pretty - good , library - equipped , and free probably would have been fatal .
Being familiar was helpful .
I used to think that BigCo - backing was a big deal , but Perl , PHP , Python and Ruby have all become mainstream working from the grassroots up .
But I still think it would help .
Back to Concurrency ·
As I survey the landscape , I ’m just not going to invest time in looking at things that are badly - engineered , or missing essential libraries , or you have to pay to use .
I think big - vendor backing could matter a lot .
Familiarity ?
It ’s not a binary thing .
Scala is a reasonably comfy place for a Java - head ; Haskell and Erlang are each profoundly weird , relatively .
Is that a fatal flaw ?
And Haskell feels way stranger than Erlang .
Does that matter ?

When I was 14 , Warren Buffett wrote me a letter .
It was a response to one I ’d sent him , pitching an investment idea .
For a kid interested in learning stocks , Buffett was a great role model .
His investing style — diligent security analysis , finding competent management , patience — was immediately appealing .
Buffett was kind enough to respond to my letter , thanking me for it and inviting me to his company ’s annual meeting .
I was hooked .
Today , Buffett remains famous for investing The Right Way .
He even has a television cartoon in the works , which will groom the next generation of acolytes .
But it turns out much of the story is fiction .
A good chunk of his fortune is dependent on taxpayer largess .
Were it not for government bailouts , for which Buffett lobbied hard , many of his company ’s stock holdings would have been wiped out .
Berkshire Hathaway , in which Buffett owns 27 percent , according to a recent proxy filing , has more than $ 26 billion invested in eight financial companies that have received bailout money .
The TARP at one point had nearly $ 100 billion invested in these companies and , according to new data released by Thomson Reuters , FDIC backs more than $ 130 billion of their debt .
To put that in perspective , 75 percent of the debt these companies have issued since late November has come with a federal guarantee .
( Click chart to enlarge in new window )
Without FDIC ’s debt guarantee program , even impregnable Goldman would have collapsed .
And this excludes the emergency , opaque lending facilities from the Federal Reserve that also helped rescue the big banks .
Without all these bailouts , the financial system would have been forced to recapitalize itself .
Banks that could n’t finance their balance sheets would have sold toxic assets at market prices , and the losses would have wiped out their shareholder ’s equity .
With $ 7 billion at stake , Buffett is one of the biggest of these shareholders .
He even traded the bailout , seeking morally hazardous profits in preferred stock and warrants of Goldman and GE because he had “ confidence in Congress to do the right thing ” — to rescue shareholders in too - big - to - fail financials from the losses that were rightfully theirs to absorb .
Keeping this in mind , I was struck by Buffett ’s letter to Berkshire shareholders this year :
“ Funders that have access to any sort of government guarantee — banks with FDIC - insured deposits , large entities with commercial paper now backed by the Federal Reserve , and others who are using imaginative methods ( or lobbying skills ) to come under the government ’s umbrella — have money costs that are minimal , ” he wrote .
“ Conversely , highly - rated companies , such as Berkshire , are experiencing borrowing costs that … are at record levels .
Moreover , funds are abundant for the government - guaranteed borrower but often scarce for others , no matter how creditworthy they may be . ”
It takes remarkable chutzpah to lobby for bailouts , make trades seeking to profit from them , and then complain that those doing so put you at a disadvantage .
Elsewhere in his letter he laments “ atrocious sales practices ” in the financial industry , holding up Berkshire subsidiary Clayton Homes as a model of lending rectitude .
Conveniently , he neglects to mention Wells Fargo ’s toxic book of home equity loans , American Express ’ exploding charge - offs , GE Capital ’s awful balance sheet , Bank of America ’s disastrous acquisitions of Countrywide and Merrill Lynch , and Goldman Sachs ’ reckless trading practices .
And what of Moody ’s , the credit - rating agency that enabled lending excesses Buffett criticizes , and in which he ’s held a major stake for years ?
Recently Berkshire cut its stake to 16 percent from 20 percent .
Publicly , however , the Oracle of Omaha has been silent .
This is remarkably incongruous for the world ’s most famous financial straight - shooter .
Few have called him on it , though one notable exception was a good article by Charles Piller in the Sacramento Bee earlier this year .
Buffett did n’t respond to my email seeking a comment .
What saddens me is that Buffett is uniquely positioned to lobby for better public policy , but he ’s chosen to spend his considerable political capital protecting his own holdings .
If we learn one lesson from this episode , it ’s that banks should carry substantially more capital than may be necessary .
You would think Buffett would agree .
He has always emphasized investing with a “ margin of safety ” — so why should n’t banks lend with one ?
Yet he mocked Tim Geithner ’s stress tests , which forced banks to replenish their capital .
Why ?
Is it because his banks are drastically undercapitalized ?
The more capital they ’re forced to raise , the more his stake is diluted .
He points to Wells Fargo ’s deposit funding model being more robust than investment banks ’ , but that ’s no excuse for letting tangible equity dwindle to three percent of assets .
At that low level , the capital structure would have collapsed were it not for bailouts .
And by the way , the strength of Wells ’ funding model is a result of FDIC insurance , among the government subsidies Buffett complains about in this year ’s letter .
To me this feels like a betrayal .
There ’s a reason he ’s Warren Buffett and not , say , Carl Icahn .
As Roger Lowenstein wrote in his 1995 biography of Buffett , “ Wall Street ’s modern financiers got rich by exploiting their control of the public ’s money … Buffett shunned this game …
In effect , he rediscovered the art of pure capitalism — a cold - blooded sport , but a fair one . ”
But there ’s nothing fair about Buffett getting a bailout , about exploiting the taxpaying public for his own gain .
The naïve 14 - year - olds among us thought he was better than this .

Ghedini : « Sentenza incredibile , irreale e infondata » .
Csm : tutela per il giudice
Sentenza Cir-Fininvest : « Berlusconi corresponsabile della vicenda corruttiva »
Le motivazioni : « È da ritenere che ai soli fini civilistici Berlusconi sia corresponsabile della vicenda corruttiva »
Silvio Berlusconi ( Eidon ) MILANO - Il presidente del Consiglio , Silvio Berlusconi , è « corresponsabile della vicenda corruttiva » alla base della sentenza con cui la Mondadori fu assegnata a Fininvest ( il cosiddetto Lodo Mondadori ) .
Lo scrive il giudice Raimondo Mesiano nelle 140 pagine di motivazioni con cui condanna la holding della famiglia Berlusconi al pagamento di 750 milioni di euro a favore della Cir di Carlo De Benedetti .
Sentenza contro la quale peraltro la Fininvest presenterà ricorso .
MOTIVAZIONI - « È da ritenere - scrive il giudice - , " incidenter tantum " e ai soli fini civilistici del presente giudizio , che Silvio Berlusconi sia corresponsabile della vicenda corruttiva per cui si procede » .
La « corresponsabilità » di Silvio Berlusconi , scrive il giudice Mesiano , comporta « come logica conseguenza » la « responsabilità della stessa Fininvest » , questo « per il principio della responsabilità civile delle società di capitali per il fatto illecito del loro legale rappresentante o amministratore , commesso nell ' attività gestoria della società medesima » .
« Si è dimostrata la ingiustizia della sentenza Metta ( il giudice che fu corrotto da Cesare Previti ndr ) e la sua derivazione causale dalla corruzione del giudice Metta , argomento che resiste in ragione del ruolo primario che ebbe il Metta nella formazione della decisione del collegio all ' obiezione della collegialità della sentenza .
« Ciò posto - aggiunge il giudice Mesiano - deve rilevarsi che se è vero che la Corte d'Appello di Roma emise una sentenza , a parere di questo ufficio , indubbiamente ingiusta come frutto della corruzione di Metta , nessuno può dire in assoluto quale sarebbe stata la decisione che un collegio nella sua totalità incorrotto avrebbe emesso » .
CONTI - Il giudice di Milano scrive anche che « vale osservare che i conti All Iberian e Ferrido erano conti correnti accesi su banche svizzere e di cui era beneficiaria economica la Fininvest .
Non è quindi assolutamente pensabile - scrive Mesiano - che un bonifico dell ' importo di Usd 2.732.868 ( circa tre miliardi di lire ) potesse essere deciso ed effettuato senza che il legale rappresentante , che era poi anche amministratore della Fininvest , lo sapesse e lo accettasse » .
« In altre parole - conclude il giudice - , il tribunale ritiene qui di poter pienamente fare uso della prova per presunzioni che nel giudizio civile ha la stessa dignità della prova diretta ( rappresentazione del fatto storico ) .
È , come è noto , la presunzione un argomento logico , mediante il quale si risale dal fatto noto , che deve essere provato in termini di certezza , al fatto ignoto » .
GHEDINI : «INCREDIBILE E INFONDATA » - Niccolò Ghedini , parlamentare del Pdl e legale di Berlusconi , ha definito « incredibile , irreale e non fondata né sui fatti né sul diritto » la sentenza sul Lodo Mondadori .
« È un tentativo paradossale di rileggere gli atti del processo penale che avevano visto Berlusconi completamente estraneo a tale vicenda .
La cifra decisa è poi palesemente scollegata a qualsiasi dato reale , superando addirittura di gran lunga lo stesso valore della quota Mondadori detenuta dalla Fininvest .
Basta questa osservazione per dimostrare l'assurdità di una sentenza che sarà indubitabilmente riformata in appello » .
GLI AVVOCATI DELLA CIR - Diverso , ovviamente , il giudizio della controparte , la Cir di Carlo De Benedetti .
« Non è una causa politica - dice uno dei legali del gruppo Elisabetta Rubini - , ma una normale causa di risarcimento danni tra due aziende , una delle quali , come è stato provato definitivamente nel 2007 , ha corrotto un giudice » .
La sentenza è esecutiva già in primo grado , ma l'avvocato ha spiegato che « prenderemo contatti con la controparte , come sempre avviene in questi casi » e ha detto di non prevedere tempi brevi per l'esecuzione della sentenza per via della complessità della vicenda .
La procedura prevede che il vincitore della causa faccia copia autentica della sentenza e , sulla scorta di questa , notifichi un atto di precetto alla controparte .
Questa avrà dieci giorni dalla notifica del precetto per il pagamento .
I legali della Fininvest hanno detto che presenteranno subito ricorso in appello con la richiesta di sospensiva dell 'esecutività della sentenza , ma l'avvocato Rubini ritiene che per la fissazione dell ' udienza in cui si discuterà la sospensiva saranno necessarie « almeno alcune settimane » .
TUTELA PER Il GIUDICE - Quindici consiglieri del Consiglio superiore della magistratura ( Csm ) hanno intanto chiesto al Comitato di presidenza del Csm di aprire una pratica a tutela del giudice del tribunale di Milano Raimondo Mesiano , dopo i giudizi espressi da Berlusconi e dai capigruppo del Pdl sulla sentenza sul Lodo Mondadori .
Non solo : telefonate di disturbo e insulti sono arrivate al magistrato secondo un '' indiscrezione è trapelata in ambienti giudiziari milanesi .
Il magistrato non ha voluto dire nulla sul fatto : « non confermo , nè smentisco - ha risposto , interpellato da un cronista dell ' Ansa - anche su questo intendo rimanere riservato » .

If you 're not already familiar with file syncing service Dropbox , you should be .
The easiest way to describe Dropbox is that it acts as a type of online storage that gives you access to your files wherever you go , no matter which computer you 're on , what OS you 're using , and where you are in the world .
No need to use a DVD , USB drive , or e-mail to transfer important files .
However , Dropbox is really much more than that : you can access and work on files even when you 're offline , share folders with friends and coworkers , and most importantly ( for this writeup , anyway ) , sync settings for numerous applications without having to fork over any cash .
Why is this good ?
If there are multiple computers in your life — like a work machine and a home machine , or a desktop and a laptop , or all of the above — you probably use many of the same programs .
Some of those programs might have their own built - in syncing services to keep things like your bookmarks or passwords up - to - date , but many do not .
That 's where Dropbox comes in — the free account offers 2GB of space ( up to 100 GB for paying customers ) for you to do whatever you please .
And since we like telling you how we use things , here are a few of our favorite Dropbox uses .
Sync your 1 Password database
1 Password is a password manager and auto - form - filler for the Mac that has been a hit among the Ars staff and readers alike .
It 's much more secure than the built - in OS X Keychain and lets you store tons of data , including credit cards , frequent flyer miles , addresses , phone numbers — you name it , 1 Password can store it .
Then , with a simple keyboard command in most major browsers ( command + ) , you can instantly log into any website or fill out any form without having to remember thousands of data snippets .
One problem some of us began running into when we started using 1 Password , though , was the fact that it lets you create very complex passwords and store them without memorizing them .
This means that when you 're using another computer , you 're a little bit screwed if you want to , say , log into your bank 's website from your laptop when you created a 15 - character hexadecimal password through 1 Password at home .
This is where Dropbox comes in — you can sync your 1 Password database across multiple computers so that you always have access to it and can always save to it , no matter what computer you 're using .
In order to do this , you must first have the latest version of 1 Password installed on all your Macs ( make sure you have the licenses to do this , of course ! ) .
Make sure you have Agile Keychain enabled ( as opposed to " OS X Keychain Format " ) by going into the 1 Password Preferences >
Keychain tab — Agile Keychain has enabled by default for some time now , so you should n't have to do anything here if you 're running the latest software .
Then , change the location where your 1 Password database is syncing from somewhere on your hard drive to your Dropbox folder by clicking the " More ... " button underneath the location path .
Once you save it to a Dropbox path , you can navigate to it using the same method on your other computer and choose the 1 Password file you have saved in Dropbox .
Voila !
You are now synced over Dropbox .
Sync MacJournal entries
MacJournal is a journaling / blog software package that has gained popularity thanks to its easy - to - use interface and relatively clean HTML output , something that is important to us here at Ars .
I like to compose my articles in MacJournal and then copy the HTML over to paste into our CMS ( unfortunately , our CMS still leaves something to be desired when it comes to hooking up third - party software to save directly into it ) .
I use a desktop machine as my main computer when I write , but I also travel and move around the house / city a lot on my laptop .
This is inconvenient when I have a half - finished article saved in MacJournal at home and need to pick up where I left off while I 'm on the road .
Again , Dropbox comes to the rescue by allowing me to sync my article database and access it from both of my machines .
Once again , you must make sure to have the software installed on the computers you plan to use .
Navigate on your computer to your home folder >
Library > Application Support > MacJournal , and make a copy of your " MacJournal Data " file on your Dropbox folder .
Then on the computers you plan to sync , go into the MacJournal preferences >
Advanced .
In the drop - down where it says " Open documents , " pull down to " Open other . "
Here , you will be able to navigate to your Dropbox folder and select the file you want to use .
Do this on both computers so you 're working off the same file .
The one downside to this method is that you must make sure to quit MacJournal every time you 're done using it from either machine .
If you do n't do this , your entries may not be properly synced when you switch to the other computer , though I 've had some mixed luck with this .
If you make sure to quit every time you walk away to switch machines , though , you should be golden .
Sync Yojimbo
Yojimbo is a popular " information organizer " for the Mac that lets you keep track of all manner of information , from serial numbers and bookmarks to images and notes — and everything in between .
Once again , you might find yourself hooked on using Yojimbo to keep track of your life , only to realize that you need some of that information while you 're away from the computer that you saved it on .
Yojimbo has built - in syncing over MobileMe , but if you 're not keen on giving Apple $ 99 every year , you can easily set up Yojimbo to sync over Dropbox for free .
A method posted to the Yojimbo Talk mailing list was suggested by some of our readers , but do n't worry if you do n't speak Terminal - ese .
The basic gist is to quit the app , make a copy of your Yojimbo library for backup , and turn off MobileMe syncing within Yojimbo on all computers involved .
Then , just like in our MacJournal example , go into your home folder >
Library > Application Support and move the entire Yojimbo folder over to your Dropbox directory .
Once you do that , make an alias of the Yojimbo folder , now located on Dropbox , and put it back into your Application Support folder ( make sure to remove the " alias " part of the folder name ) .
Once you confirm that Yojimbo is working and able to read your library from Dropbox , quit the app and perform the same steps on your other computer to create an alias from the Dropbox folder of your Yojimbo library .
Open up Yojimbo to make sure it 's reading from the right place , and you 're good to go .
Network share for the virtual office
We realize that this one is an odd fit for this article since it's about syncing all manner of files instead of just settings , but since this is one of the main ways we use Dropbox here at the Orbiting HQ , we wanted to share it .
At most IT - related jobs , there 's a network share or five that can be accessed by all employees who need to share files —
Photoshop files , supporting materials , PowerPoint presentations , spreadsheets , etc .
But as more and more people start working from home , the idea of the network share is sort of disappearing , along with its helpful functionality .
Not so with Dropbox !
Since you can share whole folders with other people , you can designate a specific Dropbox folder to act as your network share for the virtual office .
For example , when I 'm in San Francisco or Cupertino covering an Apple event , I have a script that automatically saves the pictures from my camera into a shared Dropbox folder .
Then , someone on the other side who has access to that folder gets Growl notifications when new photos are added , allowing that person to choose the right photos to drop into our liveblog .
It 's like having a whole team there without all the travel costs !
In order to do this , you must create a new directory in your Dropbox and then go to the website to share it with others .
You can either create and share a folder all at once ( click the " Share a folder " button ) , or you can share an existing folder .
From there , you can add collaborators by entering their e-mail addresses and a custom message if you prefer .
If your collaborators are also using Dropbox , all they have to do is click the link in the invitation e-mail and your shared folder will show up in their Dropbox ( if they 're not using Dropbox , they are prompted to sign up for a free account ) .
Even if you use the wrong e-mail and it goes to an account that your friend or coworker does n't use with Dropbox , the site will let that person use an existing login to access your folder .
Turn your iPhone into an e-book reader
Sure , there are a handful of ways to read e-books on your iPhone , but not every one is ideal .
The Kindle app only works for people who have Kindle / Amazon accounts , and the Kindle - compatible book selection at Amazon is limited .
Sending e-mails to yourself with PDFs attached works , until you forget to send that e-mail .
But if you sync your e-book ( or really any ) PDFs to a folder on Dropbox , you can use the free Dropbox app on the iPhone or iPod touch to access them anytime .
One way to do this automatically without requiring you to futz around with files is to set up a Hazel rule to automatically transfer all PDFs to a certain directory within Dropbox .
Then , just pop open the app and navigate to that folder to read all the PDFs and e-books you want — no e-mailing or Kindling required .

Ian Pearl has fought for his life every day of his 37 years .
Confined to a wheelchair and hooked to a breathing tube , the muscular dystrophy victim refuses to give up .
But his insurance company already has .
Legally barred from discriminating against individuals who submit large claims , the New York - based insurer simply canceled lines of coverage altogether in entire states to avoid paying high - cost claims like Mr. Pearl’s .
In an e-mail , one Guardian Life Insurance Co. executive called high - cost patients such as Mr. Pearl “ dogs ” that the company could “ get rid of . ”
“ The insurance companies are cheating in order to have obscene profits , ” ( Mr. Pearl ’s father ) said .
Guardian , a 150 - year - old mutual company , reported profits of $ 437 million last year , a 50 percent increase over $ 292 million in 2007 .
It paid dividends of $ 723 million to policyholders and had $ 4.3 billion in capital reserves , according to its annual report .
The company ’s investment income totaled $ 1.5 billion that year , a small increase from the year earlier .

Comment :
By Don McCanne , MD
Although the individual private insurance market is infamous for discriminating against individuals with a potential for high health care costs , regulations largely prohibit group plans from singling out individuals for exclusion .
When private group plans prove to be unprofitable , they can often legally skirt the regulations by shutting down the entire plan or by withdrawing from unprofitable markets , often leaving the previously insured with very difficult or near - impossible choices .
No matter how well regulated , the current proposed insurance exchanges cannot prevent an insurer that is failing in a market from shutting down .
Even with guaranteed issue , other insurers would also shun unprofitable markets and unprofitable plans .
This problem is much more common than many realize .
Look at the Medicare Advantage programs .
This year many have declined to submit bids for renewal and will withdraw from unprofitable markets .
Even this highly regulated option to Medicare can abandon patients , yet Medicare can’t .
This is one more important reason why we should question the wisdom of Congress in insisting that reform be based on a market of private plans instead of an improved Medicare program for all of us .
Ian Pearl ’s story has a couple of other important lessons for those supporting a public option as part of the reform package .
Although private plans must always protect their business interests above the interests of the patients , a public option would have a mission requiring it to place patients first .
The public option would be a victim of adverse selection since it would have to function as the safety net .
Attempts to adjust risk would drive private insurers out of the exchange , leaving high - cost individuals with only very expensive options .
What about private co-ops instead , owned by the beneficiaries ?
That would prevent insurers from “ cheating in order to have obscene profits , ” as Mr. Pearl Sr said .
Oops .
Look at the profit statement of Guardian .
It is a mutual company , and the profits are returned to the policyholders as dividends .
That is essentially what a co-op is !
Yet that did not prevent Guardian from jerking the rug out from under Ian Pearl .
Private plans with their own segregated risk pools will always use any means legal ( and sometimes illegal ) to protect their reserves from being spent on health care .
Creating a public option and then throwing it into the amoral , dysfunctional private insurance marketplace to have it compete on the same perverse terms as the private insurers is a very sick solution for our health care crisis .
Single payer anyone ?
From Food , Construction Material to Lucky Bamboo Houseplant ...
Bamboo is being used in a number of innovative ways .
Both old and new which include of course food , building material , environmental uses , decorative and functional objects of everyday need .
This material is multi-functional , fast - growing and renewable .
If ever there was an environmental product that could call itself “ green ” it would have to be bamboo .
We ’ve probably all seen these images before , bamboo lashed together to form complicated vertical scaffolding .
Lighter than steel and stronger than carbon fibre , this eco-friendly product is coming of age .
We shall be seeing more and more of this versatile plant used in innovative ways in everyday life in the years to come .
Bamboo Scaffolding

The above actually looks more like a Borg Cube from Star Trek : The Next Generation than a building scaffolding , but it is very stunning all the same .
Bamboo Bicycle
Image Source
More and more uses for it are being created , even bamboo bicycle frames .
One of the earliest bicycle frames made from bamboo goes back to 1896 !
This is being rediscovered and people seem to enjoy seeing these unusual bikes .
Skateboards can benefits from the use of bamboo .
Currently , skateboards are constructed with layers of resilient hardwood sheets and toxic epoxies for strength .
When the skateboard reaches the end of its useful life , they are discarded .
The toxic materials of epoxies , varnish and shellacs are released into the environment .
A bamboo skateboard would be compostable .
No pollution , no toxic materials .
Other innovative uses for bamboo include furniture , baskets , blinds and other window treatments , place - mats , musical instruments , eating and serving utensils and a very satisfactory substitute for hardwood flooring .
Typically , commercial bamboo is grown and harvested over a three year cyclic period .
A hardwood forest may take decades to be renewed , if ever .
Often after a hardwood forest is exhausted , faster - growing softwoods are planted in their place .
Trees like oak , ash , beech and hard maple are dwindling due to the demand for hardwood products .
Bamboo is a renewable alternative , - not to mention an effective carbon sink as well .
Bamboo Forest in Los Angeles

Common to Asia and the tropics , this hard hollow - stemmed grass can be grown in many different climates .
There are even species of bamboo which can be grown in cold weather climates to the north including every Province in Canada !
There are many different types of bamboo ; some are more for green decoration such as sound barriers and property border decoration than for intensive uses such as scaffolding and construction .
Lucky Bamboo

Often found in ‘ Big Box ’ and other stores with home garden centers , one can get smaller versions of bamboo for the home .
Usually , these are called “ lucky bamboo ” and often they are grown into intricate shapes and designs , trellises and braided or twisted like ornate bonsai trees .
These are easy to grow and require virtually no care .
There are hundreds of species of bamboo found throughout the world in a variety of climates , from tropical to dry dwelling species .
These miniature bonsai for the home are some of the most common .
Sliced Bamboo Shoot

Wow if this does n’t look like some kind of funked - out pineapple !
You just know it tastes good !
Bamboo is one of the fastest growing materials on Earth , growing two possibly three feet per day has been recorded !
Bamboo grows almost as fast as sea kelp , making it potentially very useful food source also .
The fast - growth suggests a good use would also be for animal feed as well , renewable in short term .
As a food source for thousands of years , bamboo has a rich history of uses , it was used in the construction of the Wright Brother ’s first airplane , Edison ’s light bulb used filaments of bamboo and the modern day use of bamboo pulp for erosion control on riverbanks and floodplains has proven to be quite useful .
We ’ve probably all heard of that urban legend of a form of torture allegedly used by the Japanese in WW - II where a prisoner is staked over a grove of new bamboo shoots .
As the bamboo grew it pierces the body and snakes its way around ribs , other bones , to emerge on the other side of the body .
On the television program “ MythBusters ” they attempted to replicate this visage using a ‘ crash test dummy ’ fabricated with lifelike materials that emulate the firmness and density of the human body and yes , the growing bamboo shoots did in fact pierce the faux body with enough penetrative force to ply its way around and in between bones .
This ‘ myth ’ was determined to be entirely plausible , that growing bamboo would indeed grow tortuously ( and terminally ) through a human body if so staked to the ground .
Ouch !
Delicious Stir - Fried Bamboo Tips

- Still seeing that demonstration from MythBusters in my mind , I ’d rather eat bamboo and not be fed to or impaled by it .
Mmm , - no sharp edges and does n’t this looks delicious OMG Yum !
Every day , bamboo feeds millions possibly billions of people around the world .
This fast - growing crop should be utilized more , cultivated where it can used for food , building material and shelter to take the pressure off of existing local sources that do not replenish as quickly .
Bamboo Shoots at Base of Larger Tree

In some forms of bamboo , flowering cycles are infrequent and can last for many decades and even longer than 100 - 120 years , flooding an area with its seeds and expanding its range during this time .
It is suggested that saturating the area with its flowers and seeds in unison will ensure its survival , even in a predator - filled environment .
No matter how much bamboo the predominate predator or predator species eats , there will always be an over - abundance that get to reproduce and grow .
This is just a theory and one that is disputed because the flowering cycle is so much longer than the longest lifespan of its predator , which goes against the basics of this theory .
- Why would nature build - up a local specie population for a hundred or more years with an abundant food supply then undergo a massive die - off as a means of ‘ population control ? ’
This is the entire basis for the theory , which as stated does not explain the century - plus long cycles .
That is the main reason this theory is believed to be inaccurate , the duration of this cycle .
There is something else going on with this .
Either way , when then the flowering cycle ceases for that specie that variety of bamboo die off everywhere , despite geographic location .
This seems to be like an ‘ internal clock ’ going off , perhaps something global having to do with the position of the sun in the equatorial plane of the galaxy that we do not understand ?
Or perhaps the bamboo releases some death pheromone that causes all other bamboos of that specie to respond in kind , a release that spreads the signal to the winds of the planet like nightfall descending ?
When this happens of course , a region that depends upon bamboo for food , building and housing material faces a crisis of lack of raw material for a lifestyle acquired .
The 30 - 35 cycles of bamboo fruiting and increases of rat populations and plagues of typhus and bubonic plague in the Bay of Bengal region are closely tied to the flowering and fruiting of bamboo , followed by the die - off cycles of the local bamboo populations .
Bamboo Grove Walkway

A beautiful walkway adorned with growing bamboo .
Shade and protection from the sound and effects of city living , bamboo is so versatile and appreciated .
It is difficult to believe that bamboo is really just a specie of grass .
Pit Viper in the Bamboo Grove
Image Source
Yes , even in Eden there are snakes .
Found in Asia , India and China , Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands , the venomous pit viper can be found .
There are 35 different species recognized and being eaters of rats and other small mammals , times of plenty in bamboo groves that mean more rats also favors more snakes .
Bamboo and the Giant Panda
Image Source
And last but not least , bamboo is the primary food of the panda .
Bamboo comprises about 99 % of the Giant Panda ’s diet , with fish , bird eggs , oranges , bananas , wild yams and honey are on the menu when encountered in the wild .
In case you were wondering , the type of bamboo used for making hardwood floor tiles is the not the same type of bamboo that panda eat .
I can imagine what a quasi - centennial solar variation die - off of bamboo would mean to the small population of remaining pandas in the wild .
Hopefully , there are enough species of bamboo with different flowering / fruiting season to accommodate these black and white bears of central and southwestern China .
Pandas and bamboo are inexorably linked , - they need each other .
Only one man knew all the details of a deadly explosives plot designed to cripple the economy and unleash mass carnage , terror and destruction in downtown Toronto .
That was Zakaria Amara .
On Thursday , the 24 - year - old Mississauga man , regarded as one of the linchpins of the so - called Toronto 18 , pleaded guilty in a Brampton court .
It was Amara who built the remote - controlled detonators by hand and made numerous treks to a local library to research ways to procure ammonium nitrate .
And he mustered $ 4,000 in cash to pay for three tonnes of the fertilizer , earmarked for truck bombs .
Members of the Toronto 18 planned to use three U - Haul vans filled with fertilizer bombs .
One parked outside the Toronto Stock Exchange would carry at least two tonnes , enough to bring down the building and three surrounding blocks .
Another truck would be parked near the Front St. offices of Canada 's spy agency .
Glass would shatter into the streets , cars would flip and roads would be torn apart .
And the third bomb would go off at a military base somewhere along Highway 401 , between Toronto and Ottawa .
To maximize the destruction , Amara wanted to place metal chips inside the bombs .
Amara bragged that just one of the three bombs would be comparable with the 2003 bombing in Riyadh , Saudi Arabia , which killed 35 people and wounded more than 200 .
And he was emphatic that the attack , which his right - hand man dubbed the Battle of Toronto , would be bigger than the London subway bombing of 2005 , which killed 56 people and injured 700 .
If they got their act together , maybe they could launch their attack on Sept. 11 , 2006 .
" It 's gonna start kicking ass , " Amara told his second in command , three weeks before his June 2006 arrest during a massive police sweep that netted 14 men and four youths .
" It 's gonna be kicking ass like never before . "
Amara 's confession in the landmark case is a major coup for prosecutors at the helm of one of Canada 's largest terror trials .
With his mother and wife looking on , Amara pleaded guilty to participating in the activity of a terrorist group and intending to cause an explosion that was likely to cause serious bodily harm , death or damage to property .
According to an agreed statement of facts , Amara recruited people to join the group , helped organize and lead a terrorist training camp , created a few remote - controlled detonators and purchased three tonnes of ammonium nitrate fertilizer destined for truck bombs .
To understand the blast effects , prosecutors told Superior Court Justice Bruce Durno , the RCMP Explosives Disposal Unit conducted a test with a single tonne of the fertilizer in September 2008 .
A 2,230 kilogram steel shipping container about 20 metres from the bomb site tumbled 360 degrees and was extensively damaged .
Investigators began homing in on Amara in 2005 and built up an extensive case against him that included surveillance video , electronic intercepts and a surreptitious search of his home .
Also key to the case was evidence from two police agents who infiltrated the group .
In December 2005 , Amara helped organize a jihadi training camp in Washago , Ont. , which was attended by police agent Mubin Shaikh .
Potential recruits , from Scarborough and Mississauga , played paintball games , ran obstacle courses and underwent firearms training .

Amara videotaped a co-accused delivering a speech urging attendees to wage war on the West .
By February 2006 , a car probe captured Amara saying he had built the " first radio frequency remote - control detonator . "
Weeks later , he was observed by police using a library computer to research ammonium nitrate , nitric acid and rocket fuel .
By the end of March , there was a rift between Amara and the other alleged ringleader , whose name is protected by a publication ban because he is awaiting trial .
Amara continued with the bomb plot .
A second police agent , Shaher Elsohemy , infiltrated the group in April 2006 , saying he could help Amara obtain chemicals .
After months of fine - tuning his " devices , " Amara showed the agent a wired circuit board and explained it could be called from anywhere to set off an explosion .
In May , police conducted a surreptitious search of Amara 's home and found two circuit boards attached to battery packs and a bomb manual , which included handwritten lists of chemicals and supplies .
On June 2 , Amara paid the agent for the fertilizer and assured him two of his men awaited delivery at a Newmarket warehouse .
After his arrest , police searched Amara 's home and car .
Among other things , they found jihadi documents , satellite photographs of the Parliament buildings and maps of roads around Parliament Hill , and a video of roadside bombings and the execution of western soldiers .
They also found a memory stick with a message by Amara for his co-accused .
" It seems like everything is going to happen near the end of September , " Amara says in the message , which was played in court .
" I do n't think I have anything else to say except ` God willing . ' "

Internet - Draft The Web Socket protocol October 2009 Abstract
The Web Sockets protocol enables two - way communication between a user agent running untrusted code running in a controlled environment to a remote host that has opted - in to communications from that code .
The protocol consists of an initial handshake followed by basic message framing , layered over TCP .
The goal of this technology is to provide a mechanism for browser - based applications that need two - way communication with servers that does not rely on opening multiple HTTP connections ( e.g. using XMLHttpRequest or < iframe >s and long polling ) .

Introduction 1.1 .
Background WSAPI ]
The same technique can be used for a variety of Web applications : games , stock tickers , multiuser applications with simultaneous editing , user interfaces exposing server - side services in real time , etc. 1.2 .
Protocol overview Hickson Expires April 26 , 2010 [ Page 4 ]
Internet - Draft The Web Socket protocol October 2009
The handshake from the server looks as follows : HTTP /1.1 101 Web Socket Protocol Handshake Upgrade : WebSocket Connection : Upgrade WebSocket - Origin : http://example.com
WebSocket - Location : ws://example.com/demo
WebSocket - Protocol : sample
The first three lines in each case are hard - coded ( the exact case and order matters ) ; the remainder are an unordered ASCII case - insensitive set of fields , one per line , that match the following non-normative ABNF : [ RFC5234 ] field = 1 * name - char colon [ space ] * any - char cr lf colon = %x003A ; U+003A COLON ( :) space = %x0020 ; U+0020 SPACE cr = %x000D ; U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN ( CR ) lf = %x000A ; U+000A LINE FEED ( LF ) name - char = %x0000- 0009 / %x000B -000C / %x000E -0039 / %x003B - 10 FFFF
; a Unicode character other than U+000A LINE FEED ( LF ) , U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN ( CR ) , or U+003A COLON ( :) any - char = %x0000- 0009 / %x000B -000C / %x000E - 10 FFFF ; a Unicode character other than U+000A LINE FEED ( LF ) or U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN ( CR )
Lines that do n't match the above production cause the connection to be aborted .
Once the client and server have both sent their handshakes , and if the handshake was successful , then the data transfer part starts .
This is a two - way communication channel where each side can , independently from the other , send data at will .
Data is sent in the form of UTF - 8 text .
Each frame of data starts with a 0x00 byte and ends with a 0xFF byte , with the UTF - 8 text in between .
The Web Socket protocol uses this framing so that specifications that use the Web Socket protocol can expose such connections using an event - based mechanism instead of requiring users of those specifications to implement buffering and piecing together of messages manually .
The protocol is designed to support other frame types in future .
Instead of the 0x00 byte , other bytes might in future be defined .
Frames denoted by bytes that do not have the high bit set ( 0x00 to 0x7 F ) are treated as described above ( a stream of bytes terminated by 0xFF ) .
Frames denoted by bytes that have the high bit set ( 0x80 to Hickson Expires April 26 , 2010 [ Page 5 ]
Internet - Draft The Web Socket protocol October 2009 0xFF ) have a leading length indicator , which is encoded as a series of 7 - bit bytes stored in octets with the 8th bit being set for all but the last byte .
The remainder of the frame is then as much data as was specified .
The following diagrams summarise the protocol : Handshake | \|/ Frame type byte
<-------------------------------------. | | | | `-- ( 0x00 to 0x7 F ) --> Data ... -->
0xFF -->-+ | | `-- ( 0x80 to 0xFF ) --> Length --> Data ...
------->-'
1.3 . Design philosophy 1.4 .
Security model Hickson Expires April 26 , 2010 [ Page 6 ]
Internet - Draft The Web Socket protocol October 2009
Socket protocol is used directly ( not from a Web page ) , the origin model is not useful , as the client can provide any arbitrary origin string .
This protocol is intended to fail to establish a connection with servers of pre-existing protocols like SMTP or HTTP , while allowing HTTP servers to opt-in to supporting this protocol if desired .
This is achieved by having a strict and elaborate handshake , and by limiting the data that can be inserted into the connection before the handshake is finished ( thus limiting how much the server can be influenced ) .
1.5 . Relationship to TCP / IP and HTTP 1.6 .
Establishing a connection Hickson Expires April 26 , 2010 [ Page 7 ]

Conformance requirements RFC2119 .
For readability , these words do not appear in all uppercase letters in this specification .
[ RFC2119 ]
Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms ( such as " strip any leading space characters " or " return false and abort these steps " ) are to be interpreted with the meaning of the key word ( " must " , " should " , " may " , etc ) used in introducing the algorithm .
Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may be implemented in any manner , so long as the end result is equivalent .
( In particular , the algorithms defined in this specification are intended to be easy to follow , and not intended to be performant . )
Implementations may impose implementation - specific limits on otherwise unconstrained inputs , e.g. to prevent denial of service attacks , to guard against running out of memory , or to work around platform - specific limitations .
The conformance classes defined by this specification are user agents and servers .

Web Socket URLs 3.1 .
Parsing Web Socket URLs WEBADDRESSES ]
3 . Resolve the /url / string using the resolve a Web address algorithm defined by the Web addresses specification , with the URL character encoding set to UTF - 8 . [ WEBADDRESSES ] [ RFC3629 ]
NOTE :
It does n't matter what it is resolved relative to , since we already know it is an absolute URL at this point .
4 . If /url / does not have a < scheme > component whose value is either " ws " or " wss " , when compared in an ASCII case - insensitive manner , then fail this algorithm .
5 . If the < scheme > component of /url / is " ws " , set / secure / to false ; otherwise , the < scheme > component is " wss " , set / secure / to true .
6 . Let / host / be the value of the < host > component of /url / , converted to ASCII lowercase .
7 . If /url / has a < port > component , then let / port / be that component 's value ; otherwise , there is no explicit / port / .
8 . If there is no explicit / port / , then : if / secure / is false , let / port / be 80 , otherwise let / port / be 443 .
9 . Let / resource name / be the value of the < path > component ( which might be empty ) of /url /. 10 .
If /resource name / is the empty string , set it to a single character U+002F SOLIDUS ( / ) . 11 . If /url / has a < query > component , then append a single U+003F QUESTION MARK character (? ) to / resource name / , followed by the value of the < query > component .

Client - side requirements 4.1 . Handshake ORIGIN ]
1 . If the user agent already has a Web Socket connection to the remote host ( IP address ) identified by / host / , even if known by another name , wait until that connection has been established or for that connection to have failed .
NOTE : This makes it harder for a script to perform a denial of service attack by just opening a large number of Web Socket connections to a remote host .
NOTE : There is no limit to the number of established Web Socket connections a user agent can have with a single remote host .
Servers can refuse to connect users with an excessive number of connections , or disconnect resource - hogging users when suffering high load .
2 . _Connect_ :
If the user agent is configured to use a proxy when using the Web Socket protocol to connect to host / host / and / or port / port / , then connect to that proxy and ask it to open a TCP / IP connection to the host given by / host / and the port given by / port / .
EXAMPLE : For example , if the user agent uses an HTTP proxy for all traffic , then if it was to try to connect to port 80 on server example.com , it might send the following lines to the proxy server : CONNECT example.com:80 HTTP/1.1 Host : example.com

If the high - order bit of the / frame type / byte is _not_ set ( i.e. if / frame type / _and_ed with 0x80 returns 0x00 ) Run these steps .
If at any point during these steps a read is attempted but fails because the Web Socket connection is closed , then abort .

NOTE : Do not include the port if it is the default port for Web Socket protocol connections of the type in question ( 80 for unencrypted connections and 443 for encrypted connections ) .
Send another CRLF pair ( 0x0D 0x0A ) .
Read data from the client until four bytes 0x0D 0x0A 0x0D 0x0A are read .

Internet - Draft The Web Socket protocol October 2009 NOTE : User agents will drop the connection after the handshake if the values returned for | WebSocket - Origin| and | WebSocket - Location | do n't match what the client sent to the server , to protect the server from third - party scripts .

The |WebSocket - Location| header is used in the WebSocket handshake .
It is sent from the server to the client to confirm the URL of the connection .
This enables the client to verify that the connection was established to the right server , port , and path , instead of relying on the server to verify that the requested host , port , and path are correct .
For example , consider a server running on port 20000 of a shared virtual host , on behalf of the author of www.example.com, which is hosted on that server .
The author of the site hostile .
example.net , also hosted on the same server , could write a script to connect to port 20000 on hostile .
example.net ; if neither the client nor the server verified that all was well , this would connect , and the author of the site hostile .

net could then use the resources of www.example.com.
With WebSocket , though , the server responds with a | WebSocket - Location| header in the handshake , explicitly saying that it is serving |ws://www.example.com:20000/|.
The client , expecting ( in the case of its use by the hostile author ) that the | WebSocket - Location| be |ws://hostile.example.net:20000/| , would abort the connection .

One Japanese eroge ( that is , porno games ) company has figured out a clever way to get around the country 's impending ban on rape games :
Do n't call them rape games anymore .
Okay , recap time .
Are you ready ?
Back in February , a listing on Amazon.com for a Japanese hentai game called RapeLay - where you play a stalker who rapes and enslaves a mother and her two daughters - caused outrage .
After some controversy here in the States , the game 's home country of Japan dealt with the controversy on its own , even if the Ethics Organization of Computer Software could n't seem to make up its mind .
When the dust settled , though , it seemed that rape games had been unofficially banned , and the manufacturers thereof now had to do their best in order to adhere to the ban as lightly as they possibly could .
Some responded by changing the titles ( Gang Raped by the Entire Village ~ Girls Covered in Milky Liquid ~ became The Trap Set by the Entire Village ~ Bodies Covered in Milky Liquid~ ) without changing the content , and some responded by assuming that the games would n't offend our delicate foreign sensibilities if we could n't access their site .
Now , yet another eroge company has tried another tactic - maybe if they do n't call them rape games , nobody will notice !
PC
Game download site BGameBox posted a notice that the categories " ryoujoku " ( rape ) and " choukyou " ( sexual slave training ) had been removed from the site as of July 31st .
However , as Canned Dogs reports , their ( separate ) e-mail newsletter says that the games will be rehosted on their site under new categories .
The Rape category will be renamed " Platinum " games , while the Sexual Slave Training category is now known as the " Thoroughbred " category .
I ... do n't know about you , but that actually sounds more creepy and demeaning to me , and I did n't know that was possible .
Then , of course , there 's also the scenario where some poor sap mistakes the Platinum category for something not unlike a " Greatest Hits , " and has his mind irrevocably scarred .
Though come to think of it , knowing Japan , it might actually be their Greatest Hits category .
Nevermind .

ON MARCH 5th an index of the value of the American dollar against six other big currencies touched 89.11 , its highest point this year .
Since then , however , it has been a steady downward drift for the greenback .
On Tuesday October 20th , for example , the dollar index had slipped to 75.24 , its lowest point in more than a year .
This hardly constitutes an outright collapse , nor is it necessarily cause for concern .
American exporters , whose goods have become more competitive abroad , are happy with their weaker currency .
Similarly domestic producers may be cheered that rival , imported goods are more expensive .
And European tourists , who can buy more for their euros during weekend shopping excursions to America , may cheer too .
However , the continued decline of the dollar does come against a backdrop of ominous murmurs from the likes of China and Russia , who hold much of their reserves in dollars , about the need to shift their reserves out of the greenback .
Brazil 's imposition of a 2 % levy on portfolio inflows is also a sign that other countries are getting nervous about seeing their currencies rise against the dollar .
Worries about the dollar are hardly new .
Well before the credit crunch some fretted that a collapse in the currency and a jump in Treasury - bond yields , as foreigners balked at funding America 's current - account deficit , would precipitate an economic crisis .
Instead sub - prime mortgages and over - leveraged financial institutions plunged the world into its worst recession since the Great Depresssion .
The recession , which reduced America 's imports as consumers tightened their belts , has improved its trade imbalance , shrinking its current - account deficit .
But ironically this has been accompanied by renewed weakness for the dollar .
The simplest explanation for the currency 's decline is based on risk aversion .
On the days when risky assets fall , the dollar tends to go up .
When risky assets rise , the dollar falls .
The dollar has fallen fairly steadily since March , a period which has seen stockmarkets enjoy a phenomenal rally .
Domestic American investors may be driving the relationship , repatriating funds in 2008 when they were nervous about the state of financial markets and sending the money abroad again this summer because of a perception that the global economy is reviving .
But although risk aversion may be a factor , describing the dollar as a “ safe haven ” seems dubious .
Indeed , the weakness of American fundamentals has revived the longstanding bearish case against the currency .
Some cite the American budget deficit , expected to be 13.5 % of GDP this year .
There is little sign that the Obama administration has a plan to reduce it , and health - care reform may add to it .
But if foreign investors are so concerned , why is the dollar 's decline not accompanied by a sharp rise in bond yields ?
One reason may be that the Federal Reserve has been buying so much of the year 's debt issuance , as part of its quantitative easing programme .
That has helped to keep yields down .
A simple dynamic may be at work : supply and demand .
Last year the market was short of dollars because investors needed the American currency to meet their liquidity needs .
This year QE is creating a surplus of dollars ( and pounds ) and is thus driving both currencies down .
The use of QE also creates a problem for central banks as they contemplate their exit strategies .
An early abandonment of the approach could cause bond yields to rise sharply , unless there is an unexpectedly dramatic improvement in the fiscal position .
But continuing QE could cause further currency weakness .
It is hard to see what the American authorities could do to bolster their currency even if they wanted to .
Low yields offer little support to the dollar .
The Fed seems highly unlikely to raise interest rates from their near - zero levels over the next 12 months or so .
But it is hard , also , to think of a parallel in history .
A country heavily in debt to foreigners , with a government deficit it is making little headway at controlling , is creating vast amounts of additional currency .
Yet it is allowed to get away with very low interest rates .
Eventually such an arrangement must surely break down , bringing a new currency system into being , just as Bretton Woods emerged in the 1940s .
The absence of a credible alternative to the dollar means that , despite its declining value , its status as the world 's reserve currency is not seriously under threat .
But the system could change in other ways .
A world where currencies traded within bands , or where foreign creditors insist on America issuing some debt in other currencies , are all real possibilities as the world adjusts to a declining dollar .

X- Moderator - ID : RuiJorge , newsman A long time ago , back when I was a teenager , I started experimenting with bondage .
--
By Swift .
Not that I knew what it was at the time , back then there was no internet to bring us together , and the small town I grew up in was part of America 's heartland .
Still , the fascination of being tied up still took hold , and was fueled by the easy access I had to that most common of bondage devices , handcuffs .
My Dad was a cop , still is as a matter of fact , and I used to sneak his spare set of handcuffs away and use them on myself , imagining all kinds of bondage adventures .
One morning , in the middle of summer vacation , I woke up with an urge to do more than just sit in my room with my Dad 's handcuffs on , and so began my first big self - bondage adventure .
The town we lived in was right next to a national park , a wilderness area , and I grew up learning all the trails and roads through the park for miles around , so I decided to take my bondage outside , into the forest , and made plans to do so .
That afternoon found me heading out on foot , to the place in the woods where I planned on carrying out my idea .
I have to say my heart was pounding , this was far beyond anything I had ever done before , and looking back at it later , I can only wonder what teenage hormones must have been pumping through me to make me even consider this crazy scheme .
At the time , my biggest concern was that I would n't be able to get out of town .
Wearing only a light summer dress and some sneakers I was sure that everyone I passed could see that I was naked under the dress and have me arrested .
As it was the only strange looks I got were directed at what I was carrying , a stiff sided suitcase .
I made it out of town and started along the trails , picking my way carefully , graduating toward the lesser frequented paths , until I came to the stream , or stream bed I should say .
Full of water in the spring , this stream was bone dry in the summer , and was fenced in on both side by closely packed trees .
Time for step one .
I opened the case and took out a key on a string .
This was the key to the suitcase .
I hung it at about chest height from a tree branch , and closed the case , being careful not to lock it .
I then started walking down the stream bed , until about half a mile further I came to a road .
The road crossed the stream , a large culvert allowing the water to flow .
Inside the culvert there was mud , it never dried in the darkness , my plan was to go over the road , which I did , hauling myself up the bank and running quickly across the road .
This road was a semi major county highway , and traffic passed by every few minutes , it curved though at the crossing , and I could only see maybe a hundred feet either way before the trees swallowed it .
I dropped back down to the stream bed on the other side and continued on for another half a mile , before deciding I had gone far enough .
Time for step two .
I opened the case again , and , taking a quick look around , slipped of my dress and put it in the case .
The warm sun felt very good on my skin , but it felt really strange standing there with nothing but shoes on , so i took those off too .
The sandy bottom of the stream bed felt very good , it is one of my strongest memories of the day .
Every time I go to the beach now , the felling of warm sand between my toes brings this all back to me .
I had to keep going though .
Out of the case I took the handcuffs , the key I made sure was in the case .
I then took out a length of chain and a padlock , again making sure the padlock key was inside the case .
Threading the chain through the suitcase handle and around a tree I used the padlock to connect the ends , preventing me from taking the case any where .
Then , my heart thumping like crazy , I closed and locked the case .
Now I was stuck , even without the handcuffs I still had to walk a mile naked to get the key that would open the case and let me have my clothes back , but I had to finish .
I took the cuffs and before I could change my mind I snapped them on my wrists , behind my back .
I remember feeling so turned on , never in my young life had I ever felt like that .
I wanted to stay and enjoy it , but I had to keep going .
I started back toward the key .
Up until that time I had not seen a soul , but now that I was nude and virtually helpless , it seemed tome that the forest was crowded .
Every tree hid someone who could step out and see me , every time the wind blew I could swear I heard someone moving .
There was no one there though , just the over active imagination of a teenager .
I made it to the culvert without incident , and found it a lot harder climbing up the bank without my hands than I thought it would be .
When I got to the top I got a fright as a car suddenly appeared through the trees .
I dropped down and it sped past , not seeing me .
I got up and ran across the road , almost falling uncontrollably down the opposite bank .
When my heart started again I continued on my way until finally reaching the tree where I had hung the key .
For a moment I panicked , not seeing it , but then it appeared , hard to see against the brush .
I grabbed it in my mouth and pulled it off the branch .
Now to get back .
I hurried back along the bed sure that my luck was about to run out , and I would be seen , but my luck turned a different way .
When I got to the culvert I found that the banks were too steep for me to climb without my hands .
Every time I tried I just slipped back down .
My only other choice was to walk through the culvert .
I had to bend over to get in , the culvert was n't very tall , and it only took a few steps for me to regret trying .
The mud inside was thick and deep .
In no time at all it was up to my shins and it smelled terrible .
I had to stay ducked over , my head and arms occasionally rubbing the concrete roof , so my balance was terrible , and halfway through I stepped on something I could n't see in the dark and fell forward into the muck .
I remember biting my lip in an effort not to drop the key , for if I had done so I doubt I would have found it in the darkness .
The mud felt terrible , cold and clammy , and I had to roll on my side to get some purchase so I could stand up .
Not an easy task .
It was deep enough that I was almost completely covered , and when I finally made it out the other side , I could see that there was very little of me that was still clean .
I was not happy , and wanted out of my situation , but I had no choice but to keep going .
I continued on , all the euphoria of the trip gone , until I arrived back at the suitcase , and spitting out the key , I thankfully unlocked it .
The first thing I grabbed was the handcuff key , and that was when I discovered how much trouble I was in .
There was mud in the key holes , and I could n't get the key in .
I think I did cry a little then .
I was scared and even covered in mud I had never felt so naked .
But then I remembered that there was a small lake nearby where I went swimming sometimes , and that I could wash the mud off me and out of the keyholes , with some luck .
Grabbing my dress , I started running .
I bet I was a sight , a naked , mud covered girl with her hands bound behind her .
Frightening .
It was n't long before I reached the lake , but I could n't go near it , there were some kids there .
Being very careful I got off the trail and hid in the brush , I would have to wait them out , for I certainly was n't going to go out there as I was .
As I waited , I remember thinking how stupid i was to have done this , but as time went by I began to realize how turned on I was by everything that had happened , including the mud , which by then had begun to itch like crazy as it dried .
Finally the kids left , and when I was sure I was alone I dropped my dress and the key and made a mad dash for the water .
It felt so good , and swirled and moved around until most of the mud came off .
Checking the keyholes they looked clear , so I ran back over to my dress and tried the key .
I was so happy that it worked and after several hours of imprisonment , I was finally able to use my arms .
I quickly went back into the water and washed myself down properly , making sure to get all the mud out of my hair , then I put on my dress and headed back grab the rest of my stuff .
By the time I made it back to town , the sun had dried me and no one was the wiser .
It was my first big bondage adventure , and I had survived .
I did it three more times that summer .

Remember that crazy , dual - screened Barnes & Noble Nook reader we scooped the hell out of a while back ?
Well , it 's online - official , with Wi-Fi and 3G , person - to - person lending and expandable memory .
Oh , and it ships 11/30 .
UPDATE : Site 's pulled .
Advertisement
To be clear , this is the same device we saw before — a smallish ( 7.7 x 4.9 x .5 , it turns out ) e-reader with two screens , a 6 - inch E ink display up top for displaying book text , and a 3.5 - inch touchscreen LCD down below for navigation .
Advertisement
Connectivity comes by way of free AT&T 3G as well as 802.11 b/g Wi-Fi , while storage duties fall to the 2GB of internal memory , as well as an microSD expansion slot .
Barnes & Noble claims charge time of 3.5 hours — by microUSB , thankfully — which 'll let you read for " up to ten days , " which is a curiously indirect way of describing battery life , and does n't really say much about what " reading " means .
With constant LCD use ?
Occasional ?
None ?
Audio playback seems limited to MP3s , with a 3.5 mm headphones jack taking care of output .
Say what you will about the design , but you can't fault B&N on ports .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
Naturally , the main content source is the B&N ebook store , which has a reasonable — though not spectacular — selection of magazines and newspapers too .
What the Nook has that other B&N - compatible readers do n't , though , is sharing .
As with Amazon 's Kindle iPhone app , the Barnes & Noble 's reader can be synced with the company 's various mobile apps .
Even better is the user to user sharing , which sounds an awful lot like the Zune 's old " Squirting " feature , which let people sharing DRM - wrapped songs for a limited time .
That said , the sharing terms are pretty generous :
Share favorite eBooks with your friends , family , or book club .
Most eBooks can be lent for up to 14 days at a time .
Just choose the book you want to share , then send it to your friend 's reader , cell phone , or computer .
Advertisement
Avid readers can easily plow through all kinds of books in 14 days , so this is a pretty sweet deal .
And in a deprecating nod to the Kindle 's notorious durability issues , Barnes & Noble is pushing extended warranties right out of the gate : a $ 70 protection plan stretches the stock warranty to two years , and throws in accidental damage coverage , meaning you do n't have to worry too much about pulling a Matt , which given that this thing has two freakin ' screens , is a very real worry .
Advertisement
So let 's just get this out of the way .
" Hi , I 'm Kate , and this is my Nook ! " Ha .
Ok !

The above video does give a better sense of how the reader 's control scheme works than words ever good , but I 'll give it a go anyway : the only hardware buttons you 'll really use are the right and left page switchers .
The rest , from book library navigation to settings menus to book sharing , is managed through a separate menu system on the much more responsive ( though from the looks of it , kinda jerky ) color LCD .
One one hand it 's a clever workaround for E Ink 's horrendously slow refresh rate ; on the other , it 's kind of hilarious .
I mean , really ? [ B&N ]
Preorders are live on B&N 's site , and units should hit mailboxes on November 30th .

UPDATE : Err , looks like B&N 's web guys jumped the gun a little bit , and they 've pulled the site .

Woman often do not begin taking folic acid until they are already pregnant Folic acid should be added to bread on a mandatory basis , the Food Standards Agency has advised government .
It says the move could stop dozens of babies developing spina bifida , as the vitamin plays a key role in foetal growth .
Women are advised to take supplements before becoming pregnant , but many do not do so , or take them too late .
Research has linked folic acid to a raised cancer risk , but the FSA said the evidence was not convincing .
We do n't know the exact effects of this and much is not proven one way or the other
Dr Sian Astley
Institute of Food Research
The US and Canada started fortification of bread flour in the late 1990s , and some of the subsequent research has pointed to an increase in cases of bowel cancer .
However the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition , which advises the FSA , said this evidence was insubstantial and that any increase in cases could be down to improved screening .
It did , however , recommend that those deemed to be at greater risk of colon cancer should receive precautionary advice on taking extra supplements containing folic acid , and that the situation should be monitored .
Unplanned pregnancies Between 700 and 900 pregnancies are affected by spina bifida every year .
Experts estimate this could be reduced by up to 18 % with fortification .
There are also positive health implications for the entire population , as inadequate levels of folate have been linked to a range of diseases - including cancer .
Last month there were calls for all Scottish women to take folic acid - even those not planning a family - after 15 babies were born with spina bifida since the start of the year .
Folic acid is a synthetic form of folate , a B vitamin found in a wide variety of foods including liver and green leafy vegetables .
The body cannot store it , so it must be ingested daily via supplements or folate - rich foods .
The vitamin is known to prevent neural tube defects in foetuses , but many women do not take it - in part because pregnancies are often unplanned and can go unnoticed for many weeks .
As well as cutting the incidence of spina bifida , latest research from Canada also suggests it can reduce the risk of congenital heart problems in babies .
Cereal has long been fortified on a voluntary basis by manufacturers , but suggestions that bread must be supplemented by law have been rejected by those who argue it is tantamount to mass medication .
Concerns about the how the potential risks weigh up against the benefits have been expressed .
As well as suggestions of a link with colorectal cancer , studies have also shown it may speed up cognitive decline in elderly people with other B vitamin deficiencies .
SACN did look at these issues for a report in 2007 , which ultimately recommended fortification .
But following publication of that report it was also asked to analyse two more studies relating to bowel cancer .
The FSA said that since SACN 's advice on fortification has not changed significantly as a result , its own recommendation in favour remained the same .
Discussions planned
The government 's Chief Medical Officer Sir Liam Donaldson is expected to discuss the issue with counterparts in Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland having received the updated advice .
Legislation would be necessary to introduce the measure , and it would also mean stricter controls on fortified foods like cereals to ensure people did not exceed recommended daily intakes .
Dr Sian Astley of the Institute of Food Research said mandatory bread fortification was premature .
" You cannot fault SACN for their review of the evidence , the problem is that it is a very fast - moving situation , " she said .
" Folic acid as we are given it is not a nature identical substance , and so we metabolise it in a different way .
We do n't know the exact effects of this and much is not proven one way or the other .
" We really should be waiting for the full picture to emerge from the US - they are 10 years ahead of us with this - before we make a decision on this front . "
A spokesman for the Department of Health said : " We will now consider their recommendation for the introduction of mandatory fortification of flour with folic acid alongside controls on voluntary fortification . "

I would say that I hope this comic finally puts to rest all the Marigold / Hannelore romance speculation , but that would probably be wishful thinking .
Before BioWare amassed a following among console gamers with games like Knights of the Old Republic , Jade Empire , and Mass Effect , the developer already had a significant fanbase .
These gamers loved the studio for its work on the PC series Baldur ’s Gate and Neverwinter Nights – tactical , story - driven RPGs with an emphasis on party mechanics .
No developer did that style of game better in those days , and Dragon Age : Origins proves that BioWare is n’t giving up the crown .
Dragon
Age brilliantly combines the genre ’s old - school conventions with a few modern twists to create one of the most addictive and expansive RPGs of its kind .
Attempting to summarize the experience of Dragon
Age in a few paragraphs is almost ridiculous given the depth of the game ’s content .
Six distinct openings depending on your character ( each lasting a couple hours ) , cool specializations for each class , plenty of tactical variety , and a vast array of sidequests keep you immersed in the world as time flies by .
The central narrative arc and the characters involved serve the setting well , but do n’t deviate far from expectations .
On the other hand , the subplots have some great hooks that I wo n’t spoil here – though I will say that the mages ’ tower is awesome .
A speed demon could blow through the main story in 40 hours , but thorough players can expect about 70 .
While some time is spent exploring and conversing , the biggest thrills in Dragon Age are found in combat .
This is no breezy hack ‘n slash affair ; the best encounters feel like puzzles , forcing you to use your resources wisely and make calculated decisions on the path to victory .
Which enemy poses the largest threat ?
How do you stem the tide of oncoming skeletons ?
Can your tank stand in the middle of your mage ’s electrical storm long enough to take down the ogre ?
Your answers to these questions change depending on your party members and their skills , leaving some space for experimentation .
Almost every fight can kill you if you are n’t focused , but the satisfaction of standing in the midst of your slaughtered foes after a well - fought battle makes it all worthwhile .
Even with a wealth of tactical options and party combinations , you ’ll rarely get bogged down thanks to the excellent ally AI system .
Fans of Final Fantasy XII ’s gambits will feel right at home with the concept , which allows you to manage and prioritize your party ’s actions based on battle conditions .
You can micromanage your spellcasters with a pause - and - play approach and leave your fighters on autopilot , which keeps combat flowing smoothly without sacrificing its sharp tactical edge .
In addition to capturing the joy of battle , Dragon Age also provides an engrossing backdrop for the action .
Even more than Mass Effect , the nation of Ferelden feels like a fully realized setting with its own history , conflicts , and power groups .
This is one of the main reasons the game is so addicting ; completing quests is n’t just about grinding experience and amassing loot – it actually feels like you have an impact on the world .
In the middle of reviewing Dragon Age , I had a couple vacation days scheduled .
During my long out - of - state weekend , the game was constantly popping into my mind – how I could have won a fight differently , or how I might spend my next few talent points .
As soon as my flight landed back in Minneapolis , I did n’t even fight the urge ; I drove straight into the office and spent an entire Sunday night in front of the computer fighting darkspawn and saving Ferelden .
The number of titles that can foster this level of dedication and obsession are few , and Dragon Age : Origins is among the best of them .
David Chisnall talks with Dale Rahn , the OpenBSD ARM port maintainer , about how OpenBSD support for handheld systems has improved over recent years , and why users and OEMs should consider it .

When you think about OpenBSD , if you think about OpenBSD at all , you probably think of firewalls and routers .
Maybe servers , and possibly desktops ( but probably not ) .
Recent versions have nice sound and 3D support , so desktop use is n't too unlikely , but one thing you probably do n't think of is handheld systems .
The handheld operating system market is largely owned by Symbian , although its market share has been eroding over the last few years .
Linux is starting to make inroads , and some people still use WinCE devices ( developers for the platform tell me that naming it " wince " was more accurate than most Microsoft product names ) .
Given that Symbian now has a POSIX layer and Linux has always aimed toward POSIX compliance , it 's starting to look as if handhelds may end up running a lot of the same software as desktops .
The First Ports
The initial port of OpenBSD was funded by DARPA ; Dale Rahn , who was employed by the DARPA grant to OpenBSD , and who had formerly worked for Motorola on ARM simulations , received the donation of a desktop ARM system .
After this initial port , he returned to Motorola .
At the time , a number of Motorola 's customers were interested in a UNIX - like system for ARM chips , but did n't want to use GPL 'd code in their products .
Dale was hired to work on a BSD - licensed system for these customers .
One of the first handheld platforms to excite the Free Software community was the Sharp Zaurus series .
These clamshell machines featured a 416 MHz Intel ARM CPU and 64MB of RAM .
Most importantly , they shipped with Linux .
At the time they were introduced , flash was still very expensive , so instead they came with a microdrive a tiny mechanical disk .
Running Linux meant that there was already support from a toolchain capable of building a similar system .
In addition , most of the hardware was well documented .
In 2005 , a few OpenBSD developers got hold of Zaurus systems and began a port of their operating system .
The Zaurus used the same system - on - chip ( SoC ) module as the mobile phones Dale had been working to support at Motorola .
A few of the OpenBSD developers still use the Zaurus , but it 's starting to look a bit dated .
The screen is quite small , and the processor is a lot slower than a modern ARM system .
I asked Dale if he had his eye on any more - recent devices :
We had started to look into the Nokia N800 ; however , there was n't quite enough information available to get the port started properly at the time .
Work was started on the Openmoko FreeRunner and Gumstix ( PXA270 ) at h2k8 last November , but those projects have stalled since I have had little free time lately .
At this point , both of those hardware [ lines ] have been discontinued , so it is unclear how far those ports will proceed .
The situation is n't quite as bad as it seems , though .
A lot of devices are starting to appear based around the Cortex - A8 , with Texas Instruments ' OMAP3 series being the most popular , and Motorola 's i.MX5 is a newer entrant aimed at the netbook market .
Dale continued :
Upcoming devices which look interesting include Beagle Board and Gumstix Overo .
I have temporary access to a Beagle Board , but to support it properly [ I ] would need one or two for development and regression testing .
NOTE See the Beagle Board site and Gumstix Overo pages for details on these products .
A number of companies have announced that they 're planning to produce netbooks based around ARM cores , and companies such as Dell are now shipping hybrid systems that have both x86 and ARM CPUs .
Dale mentioned his interest in the Latitude ON feature in these systems , which uses an OMAP3 core in Dell laptops for instant - on support .
By keeping the home directories on a separate partition , it would be possible to have OpenBSD / ARM and OpenBSD / x86 installed on such a machine , using one when on battery and the other when on main power .
OpenBSD gained a lot of clean hardware abstraction from NetBSD , and has maintained this since it was forked .
All code in the base system is expected to be tested on several architectures , including i386 and SPARC64 , which provide almost diametrically opposed sets of constraints .
I asked Dale how much time it took to get the initial Zaurus port working :
Most of the work was done in a couple of months .
I did the bulk of the work , with dlg@ doing most of the USB host , miod@ most of the display driver work , [ and ] uwe@ did most of the apm / suspend / cpu-speed changes .
This was a port from the Cats platform , a desktop ARM system based around an evaluation board ( and generally loathed by most developers ) , but it required new drivers to be written for a lot of the hardware .
I asked Dale how much effort was needed to add support for a new SoC :
Depends on if the family of chips is supported or not .
Typically a family of chips will have the same ( or very similar ) timers and interrupt controllers .
So these must be rewritten for each family ; however , for a new version of the family of chips , it is just a minor tweak or reused .
Most platforms can be up and running on uart , with the basic devices ( uart , tick timer , interrupt controller ) running in a few days to a few weeks .
However , supporting additional pieces , USB ( host and client ) , SD , CF , gpio keyboards , audio can take quite a bit longer .
It definitely helps if hardware is available to other developers for them to work on their different areas of expertise .
A bigger problem exists when the processor core is n't supported ; e.g. , Cortex - A8 removed one of the features in the mmu that was being used , so the physical map code needs work to function with the new changes , W^X support can be added at that time .
Unlike x86 , which has always aimed to be backwardly compatible ( even a new , 64 - bit , x86 chip can still boot MS - DOS 1.0 ) , each new ARM instruction set revision typically includes a new set of privileged - mode instructions , and therefore needs extra support , as do all of the other devices integrated into the SoC .
Fortunately , a lot of devices outside of the SoC are not attached via standard interfaces such as compact flash or USB ports .
Once OpenBSD has a working device driver for the bus , these can all run using existing drivers .
If a USB webcam works on OpenBSD , for example , it will work on any OpenBSD platform with a USB driver .
The leading Korean car company 's name rhymes with the first day of the week , as in " Hyundai , Bloody Hyundai . "
Which is pretty much what the company 's competitors are saying to themselves these days about Hyundai 's remarkable success over the past few years .
Last year Hyundai 's global sales bucked the industry 's decline and rose 5 % to 4.2 million cars and trucks .
Even in the U.S. , the world 's most competitive car market , Hyundai 's sales rose 0.8 % in the first eight months of this ...
Op - Art Scents and the City
New York secretes its fullest range of smells in the summer ; disgusting or enticing , delicate or overpowering , they are liberated by the heat .
So one sweltering weekend , I set out to navigate the city by nose .
As my nostrils led me from Manhattan ’s northernmost end to its southern tip , some prosaic scents recurred ( cigarette butts ; suntan lotion ; fried foods ) ; some were singular and sublime ( a delicate trail of flowers mingling with Indian curry around 34th Street ) ; while others proved revoltingly unique ( the garbage outside a nail salon ) .
Some smells reminded me of other places , and some will forever remind me of New York .
Government Watchdog Says Treasury and Fed Knew Bailed - Out Banks Were Not Healthy
Senior Officials Had Financial Concerns About Nine Bank Instiutions Receiving TARP Funds
The Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve lied to the American public last fall when they said that the first nine banks to receive government bailout funds were healthy , a government watchdog states in a new report released today .
Neil Barofsky , the special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( SIGTARP ) , says that despite multiple statements on Oct. 14 of last year that these nine banks were healthy and only receiving government funds for the good of the country 's economy , federal officials knew otherwise .
" Contemporaneous reports and officials ' statements to SIGTARP during this audit indicate that there were concerns about the health of several of the nine institutions at that time and , as detailed in this report , that their overall selection was far more a result of the officials ' belief in their importance to a system that was viewed as being vulnerable to collapse than concerns about their individual health and viability , " Barofsky says .
Last October , the government was in the midst of trying to contain the worst financial crisis in decades .
On Sept. 7 , 2008 , mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed under conservatorship .
On Sept. 15 , the massive investment bank Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy .
The next day , insurance giant AIG needed an $ 85 billion government loan to avoid collapse .
On Oct. 13 , after Congress had passed the $ 700 billion financial bailout program earlier that month , Treasury provided capital injections for nine institutions that together held over $ 11 trillion in assets : Bank of America , Citigroup , Wells Fargo , JP Morgan Chase , Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley , Merrill Lynch , State Street and the Bank of New York Mellon .
As of June 2008 , these nine banks accounted for around 75 percent of all assets held by U.S. banks .
In announcing the initial $ 125 billion provided to these banks , former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson on Oct. 14 said , " These are healthy institutions , and they have taken this step for the good of the U.S. economy .
As these healthy institutions increase their capital base , they will be able to increase their funding to U.S. consumers and businesses . "
That same day , the Treasury Department , the Federal Reserve and the FDIC also released a joint statement reiterating that " these healthy institutions are taking these steps to strengthen their own positions and to enhance the overall performance of the US economy . "
Serious Concerns About the Bailout Plagued Government Officials
Barofsky finds , however , senior officials at the Treasury and the Fed had serious concerns about the health of some of these banks .
Fed chief Ben Bernanke , for one , told the watchdog that the central bank believed each of the nine institutions faced certain risks given the economic environment .
" Senior government officials had affirmative concerns at the time the nine institutions were selected about the health of at least some of those institutions , " Barofsky says .
" The Federal Reserve had concerns over the financial condition of several of these institutions individually and for all of them collectively absent some governmental action .
And former Secretary Paulson noted concerns about the outright failure of one of the institutions . "
Merrill Lynch , for example , had suffered several consecutive quarters of severe losses .
One month earlier , Merrill had agreed to be acquired by Bank of America .
Merrill 's situation was so dire , though , that later that winter Bank of America 's CEO Ken Lewis told the Fed and Treasury that he was considering pulling out of the deal due to Merrill 's substantial fourth - quarter losses .
In the face of ensuing government pressure , Lewis and Bank of America eventually completed the deal and received an additional $ 25 billion in government aid .
Since last October , the bailout has generated widespread outrage .
While supporters say it saved the system from collapse , detractors say it helped only Wall Street and not Main Street , since banks have not boosted lending and unemployment and foreclosures have risen .
Barofsky , who last month called it " highly unlikely " that taxpayers would recoup their full investment , says the government 's " inaccurate statements " last fall only made the program more controversial .
Watchdog : Inaccurate Government Statements Will Damage American Trust
" In addition to the basic transparency concern that this inconsistency raises , by stating expressly that the ' healthy ' institutions would be able to increase overall lending , Treasury may have created unrealistic expectations about the institutions ' condition and their ability to increase lending , " Barofsky says .
" Treasury and the TARP program lost credibility when lending at those institutions did not in fact increase and when subsequent events -- the further assistance needed by Citigroup and Bank of America being the most significant examples -- demonstrated that at least some of those institutions were not in fact healthy . "
" The lesson is straightforward , " the watchdog advises .
" Accuracy and transparency will enhance the credibility of Government programs like TARP and restore taxpayer confidence in the policy makers who manage them ; inaccurate statements , on the other hand , could have unintended long - term consequences that could damage the trust that the American people have in their Government . "
In a letter to Barofsky , the Fed 's General Counsel agreed with the report 's findings , noting that " an important lesson illustrated by the events that shocked the financial systems over the past two years is that transparency and effective communication are important to restoring and maintaining public confidence , especially during a financial crisis . "
However , Treasury 's Office of Financial Stability did not explicitly agree with the watchdog 's report .
While Treasury called the report " a useful contribution , " they also told Barofsky , " While people may differ today on how the contemporaneous announcements about the reasons for selecting the initial nine recipients should have been phrased , any review of such announcement must be considered in light of the unprecedented circumstances in which they were made .

The Long FAQ on Liberalism
A Critique of the Chicago School of Economics :
CHILE : THE LABORATORY TEST
Changes in U.S. Gross National Product , by President Year % Change in GNP President 1930 - 9.4 % Hoover 1931 - 8.5 Hoover 1932 - 13.4 Hoover 1933 - 2.1 Hoover / Roosevelt 1934 + 7.7 Roosevelt 1935 + 8.1 Roosevelt 1936 +14.1 Roosevelt 1937 + 5.0 Roosevelt 1938 - 4.5 Roosevelt 1939 + 7.9 Roosevelt
The economy grew an astonishing 14 percent in 1936  the strongest peacetime year in U.S. history .
But does that mean that people were enjoying champagne and caviar during the Great Depression ?
Of course not .
The economy was simply making up lost ground .
Likewise , the U.S. recessions of 1980 - 82 were the worst since the Great Depression , and these were followed by an unusually strong seven - year boom : the so - called " Reagan years . "
What 's going on here ?
Two economic concepts are useful to understand this phenomenon .
The first is that the economy grows in the long run , as both the population expands and each worker produces more per hour , thanks to improving technology and efficiency .
This long - term growth experiences mild swings in the form of recessions and recoveries , of course .
But if the economy grows in the long run , then deep recessions are going to be followed by even steeper recoveries .
The second concept is the distinction between actual productivity and potential productivity .
" Potential " is a somewhat misleading term , since it implies something imaginary , but this productivity does indeed exist .
Potential productivity reflects our nation 's productive capacity ( in the form of our workers , factories , etc. ) .
Actual productivity reflects how much of that capacity is actually being used .
For example , a factory may have the potential to turn out 3,000 cars a month .
During a recession , however , its actual productivity may fall to only 1,500 cars a month .
Actual growth would occur if the factory returned to a full capacity of 3,000 cars .
Potential growth would occur only if a second factory were built .
During a recession , actual productivity drops as millions of workers are laid off and factories sit idle .
But all the potential productivity is still there .
During a recovery , actual productivity climbs closer to its potential , as millions of laid - off workers return to empty factories .
This gives the appearance of growth  and we should note that this type of growth is relatively quick and easy to achieve .
But what happens when all the workers have returned ?
Then any further growth will have to involve potential growth  that is , the construction of factories and the birth of new workers .
As you might imagine , this type of growth is considerably more difficult to achieve .
So this is all that happened that during Chile 's " Economic Miracle "  laid - off workers returned to their old jobs .
When you take both the recession and recovery into account , Chile actually had the second worst rate of growth in Latin America between 1975 and 1980 .
Only Argentina did worse . ( 6 )
And even then , much of Chile 's growth was artificial or fictitious .
Between 1977 and 1981 , 80 percent of Chile 's growth was in the unproductive sectors of the economy , like marketing and financial services .
Much of this was speculation attracted to Chile 's phenomenally high interest rates , which , at 51 percent in 1977 , were the highest in the world . ( 7 )
Chile 's integration into the world market would leave it vulnerable to world market forces .
The international recession that struck in 1982 hit Chile especially hard , harder than any other Latin American country .
Not only did foreign capital and markets dry up , but Chile had to pay out stratospheric interest rates on its orgy of loans .
Most analysts attribute the disaster both to external shocks and Chile 's own deeply flawed economic policies .
By 1983 , Chile 's economy was devastated , with unemployment soaring at one point to 34.6 percent  far worse than the U.S. Great Depression .
Manufacturing production plunged 28 percent .
( 8 ) The country 's biggest financial groups were in free fall , and would have collapsed completely without a massive bail - out by the state .
( 9 ) The Chicago boys resisted this measure until the situation became so critical they could not possibly avoid it .
The IMF offered loans to help Chile out of its desperate situation , but on strict conditions .
Chile had to guarantee her entire foreign debt  an astounding sum of US $ 7.7 billion .
The total bailout would cost 3 percent of Chile 's GNP for each of three years .
These costs were passed on to the taxpayers .
It is interesting to note that when the economy was booming , profitable firms were privatized ; when those firms failed , the costs of bailing them were socialized .
In both cases , the rich were served . ( 10 )
After the IMF loans came through , the Chilean economy began recovering in 1984 .
Again , it saw exceptionally high growth , averaging about 7.7 percent a year between 1986 and 1989 .
( 11 )
But like the previous cycle , this was mostly due to actual growth , not potential growth .
By 1989 , the GDP per capita was still 6.1 percent below its 1981 level . ( 12 )
So what was the record for the entire Pinochet regime ?
Between 1972 and 1987 , the GNP per capita fell 6.4 percent .
( 13 )
In constant 1993 dollars , Chile 's per capita GDP was over $ 3,600 in 1973 .
Even as late as 1993 , however , this had recovered to only $ 3,170 .
( 14 ) Only five Latin American countries did worse in per capita GDP during the Pinochet era ( 1974-1989 ) .
( 15 )
And defenders of the Chicago plan call this an " economic miracle ! "
Aggregate statistics are somewhat better .
Between 1970 and 1989 , Chile 's total GDP grew a lackluster 1.8 to 2.0 percent a year .
That was slower than most other Latin American countries , and slower than its own record in the 60s . ( 16 )
With the economy booming in 1988 , however , the government felt it safe to honor a requirement of its new constitution : a yes - no vote confirming the presidency of General Pinochet for another eight years .
But the government 's confidence turned out to be self - deluded , and Pinochet lost the vote .
This called for another set of more open elections in 1989 .
The fragmented opposition united to defeat Pinochet , who was replaced by Patricio Aylwin , a moderate candidate from the Christian Democratic party .
However , Pinochet remains as head of the military .
Today democracy is restored in Chile , but a laissez - faire culture persists , and many social programs ( like social security ) remain privatized .
Chile 's economic course seems to have been permanently altered .
The deterioration of labor
Chile 's erratic economy and ultimately slow growth are not the worst legacy of the Chicago boys .
The standard of living for workers crumbled under the Pinochet regime .
In fact , this is a truly horrific part of the story .
By all measures , the average worker was worse off in 1989 than in 1970 .
During this period , labor 's share of the national income fell from 52.3 to 30.7 percent .
( 17 ) Even during the second boom ( 1984 - 89 ) , wages continued to fall .
The following index shows the decline in both average and minimum wages :
Evolution of real wages , revised index , 1980 - 87 ( in percent ) ( 18 ) Year Average Wage Minimum Wage 1980 95.0 % 97.7 1981 105.0 102.3 1982 110.3 101.2 1983 91.1 79.3 1984 86.5 69.5 1985 80.0 64.7 1986 81.5 60.3 1987 81.2 55.5
By 1989 , Chile 's poverty rate was 41.2 percent , one - third of them indigent or desperately poor .
( 19 ) Shanty towns known as poblaciones grew around Santiago and other major cities , kept alive by las comunes , or soup kitchens .
In 1970 , the daily diet of the poorest 40 percent of the population contained 2,019 calories .
By 1980 this had fallen to 1,751 , and by 1990 it was down to 1,629 .
( 20 ) Furthermore , the percentage of Chileans without adequate housing increased from 27 to 40 percent between 1972 and 1988 , despite the government 's boast that the new economy would solve homelessness . ( 21 )
Meanwhile , the wealthy were raking it in .
The following chart shows how the richest 20 percent of society enlarged their share of the pie at the everyone else 's expense .
( Note : the " first quintile " represents the poorest 20 percent of society , the " fifth quintile " the richest 20 percent .
The percentage numbers here represent the share of national goods consumed by that quintile . )
Consumption by Household Quintiles ( percent distribution ) ( 22 ) Quintile 1970 1980 1989 First ( poorest ) 7.6 % 5.2 4.4 Second 11.8 9.3 8.2 Third 15.6 13.6 12.7 Fourth 20.5 20.9 20.1 Fifth ( richest ) 44.5 51.0 54.6
Chile 's income inequality also became the worst on the continent .
In 1980 , the richest 10 percent took in 36.5 percent of the national income .
By 1989 , this had risen to 46.8 percent .
By contrast , the bottom 50 percent of income earners saw their share fall from 20.4 to 16.8 percent over the same period . ( 23 )
Income was not the only thing that concentrated in the hands of the few ; so did production .
Once the Chicago boys deregulated the market , oligopolies rapidly formed in virtually every sector .
The chart below shows how many large export firms controlled what percentage of their industry :
Concentration in the Export Sector by Main Industry , 1988 ( 24 ) Industry # of firms Industry share Paper , cellulose 2 90.0 % Chemicals 2 71.4 Wine and Beverage 2 70.2 Forest products 5 78.4 Food 6 67.3 Fish products 6 51.1 Mining 7 97.1 Wood 7 78.6 Agriculture 8 80.6
How did such extreme inequality come about ?
It was part of an intentional policy to keep unemployment as high as possible .
( 25 ) Widespread unemployment has the effect of driving down wages , as unemployed workers compete for a limited number of jobs , accepting even sub - poverty wages to get them .
Many promoters of the " free market " forget  or probably exploit  the fact that the labor market is like any other market : dictated by the laws of supply and demand .
To see how this works , imagine a land where the supply of workers perfectly matches the employers ' demand for them , and everyone gets paid $ 10 an hour .
What happens if we add a few more workers to this economy ?
Economist Paul Krugman explains :
" The way that a freely functioning labor market ensures that almost everyone who wants a job gets one is by allowing wages rates to fall , if necessary , to match supply to demand " ( 26 )
" I have nothing good to say about the political regime that Pinochet imposed .
It was a terrible political regime .
The real miracle of Chile is not how well it has done economically ; the real miracle of Chile is that a military junta was willing to go against its principles and support a free - market regime designed by principled believers in a free market .
The results were spectacular .
Inflation came down sharply .
After a transitory period of recession and low output that is unavoidable in the course of reversing a strong inflation , output started to expand , and ever since , the Chilean economy has performed better than any other South American economy .
" In Chile , the drive for political freedom , that was generated by economic freedom and the resulting economic success , ultimately resulted in a referendum that introduced political democracy .
Now , at long last , Chile has all three things : political freedom , human freedom and economic freedom .
Chile will continue to be an interesting experiment to watch to see whether it can keep all three or whether , now that it has political freedom , that political freedom will tend to be used to destroy or reduce economic freedom . " ( 31 )
" The liquid that emerges from the millions of faucets in the homes and alleys of Santiago have levels of copper , iron , magnesium and lead which exceed by many times the maximum tolerable norms .
[ The lands that ] supply the fruits and vegetables of the Metropolitan Region are irrigated with waters that exceed by 1000 times the maximum quantity of coliforms acceptable .
[ This is why Santiago ] has levels of hepatitis , typhoid , and parasites which are not seen in any other part of the continent . " ( 35 )
" In his speeches and articles , Piñera credits the Chilean pension model with producing just about everything short of the second coming of Christ : pensions that are 40 - 50 percent higher than under Social Security ; security for the old ; lower costs due to the ' fact ' that the private sector is much more efficient than the public ; a rate of savings rivaling that in an Asian ' tiger ' economy ; and even the end of class conflict in Chile . " ( 38 )

Like most oil - to - fuel efforts , the Solix project focuses on making biodiesel , which can be used in a regular diesel engine .
“ This is still a very young industry , with a lot of claims out there that are sometimes difficult to believe , ” said Al Darzins , a group manager at the lab ’s National Bioenergy Center .
Mr. Darzins said Solix ’s model was different from most : the algae is grown in closed bags , lined up vertically in the water tanks , with the intent of increasing yield .
But for every hopeful , he said , the crux will be controlling costs .

Solix ’s facility project is next to the natural gas processing plant for access to the carbon dioxide waste stream , which will be used to nourish the algae  a kind of biological recycling of carbon dioxide before its discharge into the atmosphere as the vegetable fuel is burned .

Why exactly do people vote for the BNP ?
By Dominic Casciani
BBC News
Nick Griffin , leader of the British National Party , will appear on BBC One 's Question Time on Thursday .
We visited one of the areas where the party has support to find out whether people there agreed with the controversial decision to give him air time on the show .
Stepping off the tube at Barking the first thing to greet the arriving visitor , inside the ticket hall , is a stand for a sim card company , offering tasty deals to call a number of African countries .
About a hundred yards away , around the corner from the market , there 's a traditional East End pie and mash shop .
Or at least there was .
It is closed down and stands empty .
These two things are entirely unrelated - and they are symbolic of how communities change .
But it 's the kind of symbolism that makes this east London borough a front in the political battle between the British National Party and its opponents .
BNP EXPLAINED
Political party formed in 1982 which stands for the rights of the ' indigenous peoples of the UK '
Wants an immediate halt to all immigration and voluntary repatriation of British citizens ' of foreign descent ' Received 6 % of vote in 2009 's European Parliament elections
Won 15 council seats out of 584 contested in 2008 England local elections
Told by a court this month to change its membership rules , which currently restrict ' non-whites '
BBC defends BNP move amid protest
The party has 12 councillors and believes it can shatter Labour 's historic hold on the area .
The Department for Communities and Local Government is so concerned about the borough of Barking and Dagenham that four of its wards have been put on a special list of areas that need intensive support to combat potentially volatile disenchantment among white working classes .
That 's effectively official code for a rise in far - right activity .
But trying to get people to talk honestly about why they support the BNP is n't easy .
One white , middle - aged man is decidedly reticent about where he stood on the party 's Question Time appearance .
" I think it 's a good idea , Griffin is all right .
But that 's all I 'm saying . "
" Can I ask you why ? "
" Er , no , " he replies .
" You support the BNP ? "
" It 's Dagenham , that 's what I 'm saying .
You can see why . "
" Because of the way it 's changed ? "
And then it all floods out : " Yeah because every second house is an African , I 'm not racist , I 've got loads of coloured friends but when every second house is African , they 're moving in , got two cars , bought houses , what can you say ?
We got nothing . "
Betrayal and belonging Councillor Bob Bailey is the leader of the BNP group on the local authority .
The party 's pitch in the borough is that Labour has betrayed the working classes because the " system " favours immigrants over the " indigenous " British people .
Bob Bailey : BNP group leader on council " The indigenous people have been stripped of their freedoms and rights , like a right to a job , " says Mr Bailey .
Does anyone have a right to a job ?
Surely people have to stand on their own two feet ?
Is n't that the argument of all the mainstream parties - equipping people for the realities of the modern world ?
And have n't British citizens been going to work abroad for as long as migrant workers have been coming here ?
" Lab - Lib - Con - trick .
What 's the point of employing British people if you can employ some foreigner for half the price ? " he responds .
But is n't that the responsibility of the employer rather than the worker ?
Then his argument develops beyond the economics of competition .
Foreigners are not members of the Barking community .
Bob Bailey is himself an outsider - born in Scunthorpe .
But he says that 's different because he is " ethnically British " and can fit in , " make connections " .
" What we have got here is n't a community .
It 's this group and that group .
People move in , they 're transient with their five passports .
Nigerians .
Congolese , Polish , Lithuanian , lots of Russians . "
We 're sitting in a McDonald 's as he says this .
The woman who served us was a headscarf - wearing young Muslim with a sharp East End " innit " at the end of her sentences .
To my left , as we talk , there 's a white family .
The late - teens girl is sitting with her mum and a boy who is black .
There 's another obviously mixed - race couple smooching and sharing an iPod .
All of these people seem to be getting on just fine .
But none of this is visible evidence of a community in Mr Bailey 's view .
It 's cultural " wash - out " .
" They can be civically British , with a passport , but they 're not ethnically British .
Let 's face it , it 's the look - test , " he says .
Out canvassing
Out on the streets near Dagenham Heathway Tube station , June , a middle - aged woman stops Mr Bailey .
" Good luck to Nick , " says June .
" I voted for the BNP because England is ruined , completely .
They 've let too many immigrants in .
Full stop .
Their housing comes before ours , before the English people .
This area has changed for the worse , I think it 's a terrible area because there are too many foreigners , sorry about that , but it 's my opinion . "
June is impressed by Mr Bailey and thinks he is doing a good job .
Housing : Fear over competition for resources I ask the councillor why he was recently disqualified from driving for 18 months after refusing to provide a breath test to the police .
" It was my entitlement .
I did n't want to give one .
They knew what they were doing .
I 've had all this out and it 's done with . "
According to the prosecutor in the case , he did n't give a sample because he was probably over the limit .
The councillor said he feared being set up because of his beliefs .
Meanwhile , a fellow BNP councillor for Barking , Richard Barnbrook , is suspended after recording a promotional video in which he cites two murders in the area that never actually happened .
He 's been ordered to attend an ethics course .
Does n't all of this prove their critics ' point that the BNP is simply not a normal political party - and it has no right to be on Question Time ?
Mr Bailey dismisses it all as minor details and says it does n't undermine Mr Griffin 's right to be heard .
He adds that the greatest corruption in politics at the moment is the scandal over MPs ' expenses .
One BNP critic at Dagenham Heathway agrees with the last point .
" Griffin should be allowed on because of democracy , " says the woman who is a teaching assistant .
" I do n't agree with him or the BNP at all .
I think he's an idiot - but he needs to be on TV to prove that .
" I do n't like the fact that the BNP are in the borough .
They shout that they have a lot of support but I do n't think they have it at all .
If more people actually go out and vote next time , that will prove how little support they 've really got .
" In my school it 's multi-racial .
We do n't have any problems whatsoever .
That 's the true face of the borough really . "
Hers is not a lone voice .
Everyone else who describes themselves as a BNP critic says they are looking forward to seeing Mr Griffin on BBC One .
But not a single resident who is black or Asian wants to talk about it .

Australian atheists are under attack , with the websites of both the Atheist Foundation of Australia and the Global Atheist Convention knocked offline in a major cyber attack yesterday afternoon .
The " distributed denial of service " attacks flooded the websites with traffic , forcing them offline about 5.20 pm yesterday .
As of this morning , the foundation had still not been able to restore the websites .
The attacks may be related to the Global Atheist Convention , which is being held in Melbourne in March next year .
Speakers include Richard Dawkins , author of The God Delusion and comedy writer Catherine Deveny .
About 1000 tickets have been sold so far through the Global Atheist Convention website , which was set up , and is operated , by the AFA .
The AFA is billing the event as the largest gathering of atheists in Australian history but ticket sales have had to be halted for now due to the cyber attack .
David Nicholls , president of the AFA , said it was not yet clear whether the attacks were motivated by religion or conservative Christian groups ' anger at the AFA 's lobbying for a more secular society .
However , the fact that two separate atheism - related websites were hit suggested the attack was targeted at atheists .
" We have been informed that the Atheist Foundation of Australia and the Global Atheist Convention sites were the specific target of the attacks , " Nicholls said , adding he had reported the incident to the Australian Federal Police .
" This may not be just an attack on atheism , but an attack on freedom of speech . "
The company hosting the websites has disconnected them in the face of the attacks , which knocked out other websites hosted by the provider .
Now , the AFA must find a new host and Nicholls said he expected the sites to be back online within half a day .
" Our aim is to keep the Australian government , education and welfare systems secular , " Nicholls said .
" Unfortunately , some people in our society find that very confronting . "
The cyber attacks are reminiscent of last year 's major attacks on Scientology websites by a group of loosely connected online miscreants that called themselves Anonymous .
In May this year , 19 - year - old Dmitriy Guzner from New Jersey agreed to plead guilty to playing a part in the attacks , which crashed Scientology websites .
The final outcome of the case is not clear but he faced up to 10 years in prison .

When Pandora 's
Box is finally fully opened on the deceptions and abuses of power by the Cheney / Bush administration ~ the 9/11 conspiracy and cover - up will stand alone as the most treasonous act in American history .
Here are 40 experts , including Commission members , who share their misgivings about the 9/11 Commission and the questions left unanswered :
The resignation Sunday of longtime Bay Area activist Van Jones as a White House environmental adviser left many progressives , including myself , rightfully angry at the Obama administration for crumbling to conservative criticism of Jones ' controversial past comments and actions ~ particularly regarding 9/11 .
Jones resigned amid a furor over his signature on a 2004 petition rightfully questioning the government 's actions around the Sept.11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
A petition that I and many other Progressive leaders proudly signed and still support .
As Gandhi once said ~
An error does not become truth by reason of multiplied propagation , nor does truth become error because very few choose to see or acknowledge it .
So let 's set the record straight , Van Jones was not alone in his misgivings about the government 's actions around the 9/11 attacks and most certainly it 's response ~ as alluded to in the obviously deeply flawed 9/11 Commission report .
Here are 40 experts , including the Chairman , 9/11 Commission , Thomas H. Kean , Former Governor of New Jersey and Vice Chairman , 9/11 Commission , Lee Hamilton , Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence , Homeland Security Advisory Council ~ sounding off in short quotes about their misgivings with the 9/11 commission and the far too many questions that are still UNANSWERED .
9/11 REVISITED AND QUESTIONED
Summarized from www.patriotsquestion911.com.
Senator Max Cleland – Former member of the 9/11 Commission , resigned in December 2003 " I , as a member of the [ 9/11 ]
Commission , cannot look any American in the eye ...
It is a national scandal ... this White House wants to cover [ 9/11 ] up . "
Senator Mark Dayton ~ Member , Senate Committee on Armed Services and Homeland Security " [ NORAD ] lied to the American people , they lied to Congress and they lied to your 9/11 Commission ... the most gross incompetence and dereliction of responsibility and negligence "
Congressman Ron Paul - Vice Chairman of the Oversight and Investigations subcommittee " the [ 9/11 ] investigations that have been done so far as more or less cover - up and no real explanation "
Congressman Curt Weldon - " [ 9/11 Commission ] there 's something very sinister going on here ... something desperately wrong ...
This involved what is right now the covering up of information that led to the deaths of 3,000 people "
Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney - Member of the House Armed Services Committee " the [ 9/11 ]
Commission ran up against obstruction by the administration and non-cooperation from government agencies ... the errors and omissions immediately jumped out at us "
Director of the FBI , Louis Freeh – " [ 9/11 Commission ] findings -- raises serious challenges to the commission 's credibility and , if the facts prove out , might just render the commission historically insignificant itself "
Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Treasury , Paul Craig Roberts , PhD - " Distinguished national and international scientists and scholars present massive evidence that the 9/11 Commission Report is a hoax and that the 9/11 " terrorist attack " has been manipulated to serve a hegemonic agenda in the Middle East ...
We know that it is strictly impossible for any building , much less steel columned buildings , to " pancake " at free fall speed .
Therefore , it is a non-controversial fact that the official explanation of the collapse of the WTC buildings is false "
Assistant Secretary of Housing , Catherine Austin Fitts - " Regarding 9/11
" The official story could not possibly have happened ...
It ’s not possible .
It ’s not operationally feasible ...
The Commission was a whitewash . "
U.S. Army Intelligence officer , Federal Prosecutor , Office of Special Investigations , U.S. Department of Justice , John Loftus ~
" The information provided by European intelligence services prior to 9/11 was so extensive that it is no longer possible for either the CIA or FBI to assert a defence of incompetence "
Foreign Service Officer , George Kenney - " I cannot believe , much as I might like to , the standard account of 9/11 "
Foreign Service Officer , J. Michael Springman - " Fifteen of the nineteen people who allegedly flew airplanes into buildings in the United States got their visas from the same CIA Consulate at Jeddah "
Deputy Attorney General , State of Pennsylvania , Philip J. Berg , Esquire - " The official story of what actually took place on 9/11 is a lie . "
Major General U.S. Army , Commanding General of U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command , Albert Stubblebine ~
" I look at the hole in the Pentagon and I look at the size of an airplane that was supposed to have hit the Pentagon .
And I said , ‘ The plane does not fit in that hole ’ .
So what did hit the Pentagon ? "
Col. Ronald D. Ray , U.S. Marine Corps – Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense , Deputy Director of Field Operations for the U.S. Marine Corps Historical Center - " I 'm astounded that the conspiracy theory advanced by the administration could in fact be true and the evidence does not seem to suggest that 's accurate "
Col. Robert Bowman , U.S. Air Force , Director of Advanced Space Programs , PhD Aeronautics and Nuclear Engineering -" the official 9/11 story is impossible ..
There is a cover up .. high levels of our government do n't want us to know what happened .. highly placed individuals in the administration ..
Dick Cheney .. the very kindest thing we can say about George W Bush .. is high treason and conspiracy to commit murder "
Col. George Nelson , U.S. Air Force , aircraft accident investigator ~
" I never witnessed nor even heard of an aircraft loss , where the wreckage was accessible , that prevented investigators from finding enough hard evidence to positively identify the make , model , and specific registration number of the aircraft -- and in most cases the precise cause of the accident ...
The government alleges that four wide - body airliners crashed on the morning of September 11 , 2001 , resulting in the deaths of more than 3,000 human beings , yet not one piece of hard aircraft evidence has been produced in an attempt to positively identify any of the four aircraft .
On the contrary , it seems only that all potential evidence was deliberately kept hidden from view .. with all the evidence readily available at the pentagon crash site , any unbiased rational investigator could only conclude that a Boeing 757 did not fly into the Pentagon as alleged .
Similarly , with all the evidence available at the Pennsylvania crash site , it was most doubtful that a passenger airliner caused the obvious hole in the ground and certainly not the Boeing 757 as alleged .. the most heinous conspiracy in our country 's history "
Major Douglas Rokke , PhD , U.S. Army ~
" Regarding the impact at the Pentagon on 9/11/2001 " when you look at the damage , it was obviously a missile . "
Capt .
Russ Wittenberg , U.S. Air Force , fighter pilot , commercial pilot flying 707 , 720 , 727 , 737 , 747 , 757 , 767 , and 777 ’s .
Had previously flown Flight 93 , which impacted in Pennsylvania , and Flight 175 , the second plane to hit the WTC ~ " The government story they handed us about 9/11 is total B.S. plain and simple ... [ Regarding Flight 77 ]
" The airplane could not have flown at those speeds which they said it did without going into what they call a high speed stall .
The airplane wo n’t go that fast if you start pulling those high G maneuvers at those bank angles ...
The vehicle that hit the Pentagon was not Flight 77 "
Lt. Col. Karen U. Kwiatkowski , PhD , U.S. Air Force , Office of the Secretary of Defense , staff of the Director of the National Security Agency ~
" It is as a scientist that I have the most trouble with the official government conspiracy theory , mainly because it does not satisfy the rules of probability or physics .
The collapses of the World Trade Center buildings clearly violate the laws of probability and physics ... There was a dearth of visible debris on the relatively unmarked Pentagon , where I stood only minutes after the impact .
Beyond this strange absence of airliner debris , there was no sign of the kind of damage one would expect from the impact of a large airliner ... this visible evidence or lack thereof may also have been apparent to the Sec of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , who in an unfortunate slip of the tongue referred to the aircraft that slammed into the Pentagon as a ' missile ' ... I saw nothing of significance at the point of contact ~ no airplane metal or cargo debris was blowing on the lawn in front of the damaged building as smoke billowed from within the Pentagon .. all of us staring at the Pentagon that morning were indeed looking for such debris , but what we expected was not evident .. the same is true with regard to the damage we expected .. but I did not see this kind of damage .
Rather , the facade had a rather small hole , no larger than 20 feet in diameter .
Although this facade later collapsed , it remained standing for 30 0r 40 minutes , with the roof remaining relatively straight ..
The scene , in short , was not what I would have expected from a strike by a large jetliner .
It was , however , exactly what one would have expected if a missile had struck the Pentagon "
Senior Military Affairs Journalist at the Naval Postgraduate School , Barbara Honegger , MS ~ " The US military , not al Qaeda , had the sustained access weeks before 9/11 to also plant controlled demolition charges throughout the superstructures of WTC 1 and WTC 2 , and in WTC 7 , which brought down all three buildings on 9/11 ... A US military plane , not one piloted by al Qaeda , performed the highly skilled , high −speed 270 − degree dive towards the Pentagon that Air Traffic Controllers on 9/11 were sure was a military plane as they watched it on their screens .
Only a military aircraft , not a civilian plane flown by al Qaeda , would have given off the " Friendly " signal needed to disable the Pentagon ’s anti−aircraft missile batteries as it approached the building ...
Only the US military , not al Qaeda , had the ability to break all of its Standard Operating Procedures to paralyze its own emergency response system "
Capt .
Gregory M. Zeigler , PhD , U.S. Army , U.S. Army Intelligence Officer ~
" I knew from September 18 , 2001 , that the official story about 9/11 was false .
... [ A ] nomalies poured in rapidly : the hijackers ' names appearing in none of the published flight passenger lists , BBC reports of stolen identities of the alleged hijackers or the alleged hijackers being found alive , the obvious demolitions of WTC 1 and 2 ... and WTC7 ... not hit by an airplane ... the lack of identifiable Boeing 757 wreckage at the Pentagon "
Capt . Eric H. May , U.S. Army , Intelligence officer ~
" I view the 911 event ... as a matter that implies either ... A ) passive participation by the Bush White House through a deliberate stand - down or B ) active execution of a plot by rogue elements of government , starting with the White House itself , in creating a spectacle of destruction that would lead the United States into an invasion of the Middle East "
Former Chairman , National Intelligence Estimates , CIA , responsible for preparing the President ’ Daily Brief , U.S. Army Intelligence Officer , Raymond L. McGovern ~ " I think at simplest terms , there ’s a cover - up .
The 9/11 report is a joke ... just as Hitler in 1933 cynically exploited the burning of the parliament building , the Reichstag , this is exactly what our President did in exploiting 9/11 ... making a war of aggression on a country that he knew had nothing to do with 9/11 ... that ’s certainly an impeachable offense ...
But compelling evidence for an even more disturbing conclusion : that the 9/11 attacks were themselves orchestrated by this administration precisely so they could be thus exploited . "
National Intelligence Officer and Director of the CIA 's Office of Regional and Political Analysis , William Christison ~ " there is persuasive evidence that the events of September did not unfold as the Bush administration and the 9/11 Commission would have us believe . …
An airliner almost certainly did not hit The Pentagon . …
The North and South Towers of the World Trade Center almost certainly did not collapse and fall to earth because hijacked aircraft hit them ... this all was totally an inside job …
I have since decided that .... at least some elements in this US government had contributed in some way or other to causing 9/11 to happen or at least allowing it to happen ...
The reason that the two towers in New York actually collapsed and fell all the way to the ground was controlled explosions rather than just being hit by two airplanes . …
All of the characteristics of these demolitions show that they almost had to have been controlled explosions ...
I think you almost have to look at the 9/11 Commission Report as a joke and not a serious piece of analysis at all ...
It 's a monstrous crime "
U.S. Marine Corps intelligence officer , case officer CIA .
Robert David Steele ~
" I am forced to conclude that there is sufficient evidence to indict ( not necessarily convict ) Dick Cheney , Karl Rove and others ... This is , without question , the most important modern reference on state - sponsored terrorism , and also the reference that most pointedly suggests that select rogue elements within the US Government , most likely led by Dick Cheney with the assistance of George Tenet , Buzzy Kronguard , and others close to the Wall Street gangs , are the most guilty of state - sponsored terrorism ... I 'm absolutely certain that WTC 7 was brought down by controlled demolition and that as far as I 'm concerned means that this case has not been properly investigated .
There 's no way that building could have come down without controlled demolition "
CIA Case Officer , Specialist in the Middle East , Directorate of Operations , Awarded Career Intelligence Medal , Robert Baer ~ " Regarding the opinion there was an aspect of ' inside job ' to 9/11 within the U.S. government , " There is that possibility , the evidence points at it . "
Counter - terrorism expert in the Security Division of the federal Aviation Administration .
Team leader of the FAA 's Red ( Terrorism ) Team in the Federal Air Marshall program , Coast Guard officer , Bogdan Dzakovic ~ " At worst , I think the 9/11 Commission Report is treasonous . "
Minister of Justice , West Germany , Horst Ehmke , PhD - " Terrorists could not have carried out such an operation with four hijacked planes without the support of a secret service . "
State Secretary , Federal Ministry of Defense , West Germany , Andreas von Buelow , PhD - " The official story is so inadequate and far - fetched that there must be another one ... This is unthinkable , without years - long support from secret apparatuses of the state and industry . "
President of Italy , Francesco Cossiga ~ " [ 9/11 ] could not be accomplished without infiltrations in the radar and flight security personnel . "
General Leonid Ivashov , Chief of Staff , Russian armed forces , Ministry of Defense ~ " Only secret services and their current chiefs – or those retired but still having influence inside the state organizations – have the ability to plan , organize and conduct an operation [ 9/11 ] of such magnitude ... Osama bin Laden and " Al Qaeda " cannot be the organizers nor the performers of the September 11 attacks .
They do not have the necessary organization , resources or leaders . "
Foreign Minister of Egypt , Mohamed Hassanein Heikal ~ " Bin Laden does not have the capabilities for an operation [ 9/11 ] of this magnitude .
When I hear Bush talking about al - Qaida as if it was Nazi Germany or the communist party of the Soviet Union , I laugh because I know what is there .
Bin Laden has been under surveillance for years : every telephone call was monitored and al - Qaida has been penetrated by American intelligence , Pakistani intelligence , Saudi intelligence , Egyptian intelligence .
They could not have kept secret an operation that required such a degree of organization and sophistication . "
Chief of Staff , Pakistani Army , General Mirza Aslam Beg ~
" The information which is now coming up , goes to prove that involvement by the ‘ rogue elements ’ of the U.S. military and intelligence organization is getting more obvious .
Osama bin Laden and al - Qaeda definitely do not have the know - how and the capability to launch such operations involving such high precision coordination , based on information and expertise . "
European Parliament , Committee on Security and Defense , Giulietto Chiesa ~ regarding 9 - 11 " Billions of people were given only one explanation .... which is entirely false .... everyone who dares to question it is treated as if he was a fool . "
French Army Intelligence and artillery officer , Col. Pierre - Henri Bunel , Expert in the effects of artillery weapons and explosives ~ Regarding Department of Defense photos of the Pentagon on 9/11 " Image of the impact on the Pentagon is very instructive as to the nature of the explosion .
...
It corresponds to a detonation of an explosive with high energetic power .
The explosion does not correspond to a deflagration of kerosene ... suggests a single engine flying vehicle much smaller in size than an airliner ... resembles the effects of anti-concrete hollow charges that I have been able to observe on a number of battlefields ... lead me therefore to think that the detonation that struck the building was that of a high - powered hollow charge used to destroy hardened buildings and carried by an aerial vehicle , a missile . "
Safety Engineer and accident Analyst , National Safety Technology Authority , Finland , Heikki Kurttila , PhD ~ " Conclusion :
The observed collapse time of WTC 7 was 6.5 seconds .
That is only half a second longer than it would have taken for the top of the building to fall to the ground in a vacuum , and half a second shorter than the falling time of an apple when air resistance is taken into account .
...
The great speed of the collapse and the low value of the resistance factor strongly suggest controlled demolition . "
Counter - Terrorism Officer , MI5 ( Britain ) , David Shayler – regarding 9 - 11 " The available evidence indicates that people in key positions in the FBI , the State Department , the CIA and so on were not loyal to the Constitution ; that they saw an opportunity in plans laid down by genuine Islamic terrorists to carry out an operation that would shock the world and would therefore justify U.S. adventurism in the middle East , particularly in Afghanistan and Iraq . "
Chairman , 9/11 Commission , Thomas H. Kean , Former Governor of New Jersey - " FAA and NORAD officials advanced an account of 9/11 that was untrue ... We , to this day , do n't know why NORAD told us what they told us ... It was just so far from the truth . "
Vice Chairman , 9/11 Commission , Lee Hamilton , Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence , Homeland Security Advisory Council ~ " we got started late ; we had a very short time frame ... we did not have enough money ... We had a lot of people strongly opposed to what we did .
We had a lot of trouble getting access to documents and to people .
...
So there were all kinds of reasons we thought we were set up to fail "
9/11 Commissioner , Timothy J. Roemer , PhD , Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence - " that panel members so distrusted testimony from Pentagon officials that they referred their concerns to the Pentagon 's inspector general ... We were extremely frustrated with the false statements we were getting "
Senior Counsel , 9/11 Commission , John J. Farmer , Jr. , Former Attorney General , NJ , Former Commissioner of the State Commission of Investigations ~
Some staff members and commissioners of the Sept. 11 panel concluded that the Pentagon 's initial story of how it reacted to the 2001 terrorist attacks may have been part of a deliberate effort to mislead the commission and the public " I was shocked at how different the truth was from the way it was described ... The tapes told a radically different story from what had been told to us and the public for two years "
The truth always goes through three stages as will the eventual unmasking of the 9/11 cover up ~
First ~ it is ridiculed .
Second ~ it is violently opposed .
Third ~
It is accepted as being self evident and we are daily drawing closer to stage three .

ONLY THE TRUTH IS REVOLUTIONARY
By Sanjiv Buttoo
Asian Network
Some men are beaten if they do not provide enough money to their wife More South Asian men married to British women are becoming the victims of domestic violence , it has been revealed .
The National Men's Advice Line found 9 % of calls for help to its service last year were made by men originally from countries such as India , Pakistan and Bangladesh .
Pakistani Mahmood Muhammad ( not his real name ) married a British - born Asian woman four years ago .
Her family promised him that he could finish his degree in Pakistan before joining her to live permanently in West Yorkshire .
His mother thought his future in - laws were an honourable family , so also decided to let his sister marry his wife 's brother in the UK .
After marrying , Mahmood , who is in his 30s , travelled to visit his wife in the UK for a two - week holiday .
He planned to return to Pakistan to finish studying .
But hours after stepping off the plane his passport was confiscated by his wife 's family and he was told he would not be going back .
All they wanted was someone to earn money for them .
I was being treated like an animal
Mahmood Muhammad
His brothers - in - law threatened to harm him and his sister if he did not comply with their wishes , and by the end of his first week in Yorkshire he was being forcibly taken to factories in search of work .
He said : " All they wanted was someone to earn money for them .
I was being treated like an animal .
" All my dignity and self - respect had been taken away and I was also worried about the threats to my sister .
I was powerless to do anything to stop it . "
Because of feelings of shame Mahmood decided not to tell his family back in Pakistan .
" My wife would wake me up in the middle of the night and beat me , demanding money , and when I did not have any , my brother - in - laws would come and punch me and beat my back with iron bars .
It was a living hell . "
For four years he was not allowed to meet his own sister , who lived at a separate address nearby , or even phone her , and the only contact they had was on a handful of occasions .
She was also being beaten .
On one occasion , while she was pregnant , she was thrown down stairs , and on another she was punched in the face and pushed into a television .
The Pennine Domestic Violence Group , in Yorkshire , is now helping Mahmood to rebuild his life .
In the past two years staff have noticed that more Asian men who are victims of domestic violence are beginning to leave their wives and seek help .
Acting director Rebecca
Hirst said : " Although numbers are low , we know there are many men out there who are wanting help . "
Men ... choose to suffer in silence for the sake of respect
Shazia Qayum , Karma Nirvana National helpline The Mankind Initiative said 7 % of its clients last year came from an Asian background .
The National Men's Advice Line has also begun fielding more calls from abused men - in 2008 , 89 of its 946 calls were from men of South Asian origin , and it fears there are many more suffering in silence .
Phone line co-ordinator Ippo Panteloudakis said : " We believe the number of Asian men is far higher than our figures suggest , because many Asian men do n't access mainstream services for fear of being identified or because they are under cultural pressures not to admit they have a problem . "
Karma Nirvana , a group which helps abused Asian men and women , believes most men do not seek help as many victims marry cousins and can share the same uncles , aunts and even grandparents .
Project team leader Shazia Qayum said : " Men would feel embarrassed to admit that they were having problems and choose to suffer in silence for the sake of respect . "
" We are seeing the tip of a very large iceberg emerging , and eventually as this issue becomes more widely accepted , more and more men will come forward . "
Abused Asian men do not want to " shame " their families Mahmood is all too familiar with how difficult cultural pressures can make it to leave a violent relationship .
" I know many other Asian men who are suffering , but how can we just leave and go back home , it would be so shameful for us and our families . "
Three months ago Mahmood was beaten in the street by his sister 's husband .
After she ran out to plead with him to stop , the siblings managed to get into a passing car and escape from their spouses .
But they both left their children behind .
Mahmood said : " I have two daughters , but have not seen my youngest child who was only born recently .
My sister has managed to get custody of her children , but I will have to endure a long legal process to see mine again .
" I always ask myself how can people be so cruel to other human beings .
" I would have been better off living in Pakistan .
At least then I would not have been mentally , physically and verbally abused over a period of four long years . "

Today
Nike became the latest company to part ways with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce 's climate change policy .
" We fundamentally disagree with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on the issue of climate change and their recent action challenging the EPA is inconsistent with our view that climate change is an issue in need of urgent action , " the company , which has its headquarters near Beaverton , said in a
.
The company said it would resign its position on the chamber 's board but remain a member of the business group in order to advocate for a more aggressive climate change strategy internally .
" Moving forward we will continue to evaluate our membership , " the statement said .
The move follows pressure by some Nike shareholders for the company to leave the chamber , which

Washington : Strongly opposing any move to withdraw the US troops , Defence Secretary Robert Gates Tuesday said that such a decision would allow al - Qaeda to gain a foothold in Afghanistan and described the tribal region between Af - Pak border as the " modern epicentre " of jihad .
Any withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan , before the mission to defeat al - Qaeda and the Taliban is achieved , would bolster the Islamic radical movement in other parts of
the globe , Gates said in an interview with CNN before an audience at George Washington University .
“ The Afghan - Pakistan border " is the modern epicentre of jihad , " he said .
Gates remarks come as the Obama administration as reviewing its new Af - Pak policy and demands by the Generals for inducting more forces into Afghanistan .
An equally strong
lobby in Washington is opposing the move to send more troops .
The defence secretary said the terrorists groups are aiming to deal the same fate to the US forces like that of the Russians , referring to the Soviet defeat in the 1980s at the
hands of Islamist fighters .
" It`s a hugely empowering message ... should they be successful , " Gates said of the desire of the Taliban to take back Afghanistan .
The al - Qaeda leaders believe " they now have the ability to defeat a second superpower , " Gates said in a joint interview given with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton .
He warned that if Taliban regained control of significant portions of the country , " that would be added space for al - Qaeda to strengthen itself " and embark on expanded recruitment and fund raising activities there .
" The reality is , because of our inability -- and the inability , frankly , of our allies -- to put enough troops into Afghanistan , the Taliban do have the momentum right now , it
seems , " he said .
Meanwhile , leading American daily The Washington Post today warned that a Taliban victory would be catastrophic for the US and its allies and insisted the Obama Administration should focus on routing out the Taliban and al - Qaeda from the Af - Pak region ; even if it requires years of patience .
" Defeating the Taliban and fostering an Afghan government and army that can stabilise the country are daunting tasks that will require years of patience , " it said
in a lead editorial .
" Whether or not al - Qaeda regains its pre-9/11 haven , a Taliban victory would be a catastrophe for the United States and its allies , " The Post said .
The paper said the Taliban was fragmented , with some bits focused on Afghanistan and others on Pakistan – though all are headquartered in Pakistan .
" But there is considerable
evidence that the groups coordinate their actions . "
Bureau Report
Eric Engler does n’t have any military or law enforcement training , but he ’s considered deadly with an AK - 47 .
Lest anyone underestimate his marksmanship , he once shot five Marines in rapid succession in an abandoned Virginia prison .
Actually , Engler ’s “ kills ” were sanctioned by the U.S. military ; he was hired to gun down his fellow Americans .
Engler , 42 , is the owner of Engler Custom Paintball Guns of Jeffersonville , a small defense contractor that makes and markets paintball guns and supplies .
Because the weaponry closely resembles actual military hardware in look and feel , it has become an important training tool for the country ’s armed forces .
In the world of multibillion - dollar Pentagon contracts , Engler ’s company is small potatoes .
His largest contract to date was one awarded several weeks ago for $ 82,132 to provide the U.S.
Army with paintball gun packages .
Unfortunately for him , the contract was contested by a competing vendor and will have to be bid again in the coming weeks .
Nevertheless , Engler ’s tiny machine shop , which is based in his home garage , is definitely on the U.S. government ’s radar .
It all started when Engler organized a paintball game at West Point several years ago .
After the “ game , ” Engler was approached by several cadets who were interested in buying his authentic - looking weaponry .
From there , his business took off .
A number of federal agencies , including U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Rascon School of Combat Medicine at Fort Campbell , Ky. , have since purchased his paintball equipment — mostly , to simulate real - life combat situations .
In the Virginia prison scenario , for example , Engler and several of his fellow paintball enthusiasts were hired as “ bad guys ” to help train newly minted Marines to clear a building of insurgents without harming the civilians inside .
As Engler recalls , the Marines ’ initial performances did n’t make the grade .
“ We wiped them out the first day , ” he boasts .
“ It was bad , because these guys were right out of basic training , and this was their first experience working together as a team .
So , we ’d shoot the first guy and he ’d fall down , and the guy behind him would fall down and we ’d shoot him , too . ”
By the second day , however , the corpsmen started getting the hang of it , as they learned from their earlier mistakes to recognize potentially deadly situations .
That was three years ago .
Today , most of those Marines have since deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan .
“ From what I ’m told , their paintball training helped them a lot , ” he says .
“ If we can do anything to save a life , I think it ’s a great goal . ”
Ironically , Engler Custom Paintball Guns , which relocated to Vermont from Danbury , Conn. , two years ago , has yet to make inroads with the Vermont National Guard or local law enforcement agencies .
Engler ’s not surprised , since most of his company ’s sales are conducted online to civilian paintball enthusiasts .
As he puts it , “ No one in Vermont knows we ’re here , except the tax people . ”
That , too , may be changing .
Last month , Engler organized a paintball game in Colchester for 65 cadets from Norwich University .
Although that may sound like a big game , it pales in comparison to other scenarios Engler routinely participates in .
One , in Oklahoma , annually reenacts the D - Day landings on the beaches of Normandy and involves 2500 troops per side .
For its part , the military has also begun to recognize the R&R value of paintball games .
According to Engler , his equipment is now being used to help returning soldiers blow off pent - up energy and aggression .
As he puts it , “ Paintball is being used for a lot more things than the Army is willing to admit . ”
The mutation was transmitted from Russian Empress Alexandra to her son Crown Prince Alexei
DNA analysis has revealed the identity of the " cursed blood " disorder that afflicted the British Royal Family in the 19th and early 20th centuries .
Scientists say the disease inherited by Queen Victoria 's descendants was probably a severe form of the blood clotting disorder haemophilia B .
The scientists examined DNA samples extracted from the skeletal remains of Russia 's Romanov family .
The research is published in the journal Science .
Their analysis included the remains of Queen Victoria 's great grandson Crown Prince Alexei .
Scientists already knew that males of the Royal Family at that time suffered from a type of haemophilia .
But their latest analysis of the remains of Victoria 's Russian descendants helped identify the exact form .
Modern analytical techniques allowed the scientists to amplify the very degraded DNA .
They discovered a mutation in a gene on the X chromosome that codes for the production of Factor IX , a substance that causes blood to clot .
Queen Victoria 's great grandson Crown Prince Alexei was a haemophiliac
This genetic mutation is the cause of haemophilia B .
Because this blood disorder is linked to the X chromosome it passed on through the maternal line , but is only manifested in male descendants .
This is because males have only one X chromosome , so the mutation on that single chromosome is " expressed " as the disease .
Females only carry the disease , because their second X chromosome is extremely unlikely to have this same , very rare mutation .
Dr Evgeny Rogaev from the University of Massachusetts led the research .
He told the BBC that it was the " final chapter " in the confirmation of the Romanov family 's remains .
He added : " We have resolved a medical mystery from the past . "
“ Marijuana and other illicit drugs are addictive and unsafe especially for use by young people .
The science , though still evolving in terms of long - term consequences , is clear : marijuana use is harmful .
Independent from the so called ‘ gateway effect ’— marijuana on its own is associated with addiction , respiratory and mental illness , poor motor performance , and cognitive impairment , among other negative effects .
Despite successful political campaigns to legalize ‘ medical ’ marijuana in 15 states and the District of Columbia , the cannabis ( marijuana ) plant itself is not medicine .
While there may be medical value for some of the individual components of the cannabis plant , the fact remains that smoking marijuana is an inefficient and harmful method for delivering the constituent elements that have or may have medicinal value .
As always , the FDA process remains the only scientific and legally recognized procedure for bringing safe and effective medications to the American public .
To date , the FDA has not found smoked marijuana to be either safe or effective medicine for any condition ( see more on medical marijuana below ) . ”
Getting excited to see the Joss Whedon / Drew Goddard horror collaboration The Cabin In The Woods ?
Here 's the bad news :
Its release date has been pushed from February 2010 to January 2011 ... because so many people want to see it .
Whuh ?

The reason given by studio MGM for the release date shift is because advance tracking for the movie has been so positive that they 're going to convert the Goddard - directed , Whedon co-written movie into 3D .
Whether the almost year - long shift for release will lower that advance anticipation remains to be seen , of course .
Whedon's Cabin in the Woods Pushed , Going 3 - D! [ Shock Till You Drop ]
( HEALTH .COM ) -- Ashley Price felt terrible .
She was tired , dizzy spells came and went , dark splotches popped up on her chest for no reason , and she 'd gained 50 pounds in two years .
Some days she was starving ; other days she could barely eat .
Her doc suggested that her problems would go away if Price just ate less and exercised more , even though she was dieting and working out regularly .
Price demanded thyroid tests , only to have them come back normal .
Her doctor told her : " I have no idea what it is .
Wait for it to go away . "
It did n't go away .
" I could no longer think straight , no matter how hard I tried or what I did , " Price says .
Worse , she suffered three straight miscarriages .
Finally , four years after this nightmare began -- after the third miscarriage -- an ultrasound revealed that her ovaries were riddled with cysts .
She had polycystic ovary syndrome , a hormonal disorder ; symptoms include irregular periods , infertility , brain fog , and obesity .
Price 's gynecologist prescribed metformin , and she finally got some relief .
" I had myself back , " she remembers .
" I had energy , I could think , I was n't starving all the time . "
Best of all , she finally had a baby , born last June .
Price is n't alone .
Experts say more women than we know walk out of doctors ' offices feeling that their symptoms have n't been taken seriously .
They are told that their complaints are all in their heads or that everything will be fine if they would just stop worrying .
The truth : Women who know something 's wrong but can't get the help they need often have an autoimmune disorder , which occurs when the immune system attacks itself .
One in five Americans has one , and three - quarters of them ( about 22 million ) are women .
Some women live with unbearable symptoms for 10 or 15 years before finally getting the right diagnosis and treatment .
" More than 40 percent of women eventually diagnosed with a serious autoimmune disease have basically been told by a doctor that they 're just too concerned with their health or they 're a hypochondriac , " says Virginia Ladd , founder and executive director of the American Autoimmune Related Diseases Association .
What 's the best way to avoid Price 's fate and get help fast ?
Ladd and other health experts say you must educate and empower yourself by learning the names , risk factors , symptoms , and treatments for the seven most commonly misdiagnosed women 's illnesses described here .
Then push your physician to take you seriously .
1. Polycystic ovary syndrome
What is it , and who gets it ?
Polycystic ovary syndrome -- the most common hormonal disorder among women of reproductive age ( as many as 1 in every 10 women of childbearing age will develop it ) and the leading cause of infertility -- stems from having levels of androgens , or male hormones , that are too high .
The androgen overload is actually caused by an imbalance in insulin , the hormone that helps regulate blood sugar .
" Insulin is a growth hormone , and it makes you fat , " says Dr. Katherine Sherif , co-director of the Center for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome at Drexel University College of Medicine in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania .
Excess insulin bombards the ovaries , causing them to produce too much testosterone and develop cysts .
Half of all women with PCOS end up with prediabetes or diabetes .
How does it feel ?
Besides irregular periods , or none at all , you may notice more hair on your face , chest , back , and limbs .
Also typical are acne , baldness , and rapid , substantial weight gain ( more than 10 pounds a year ) that seems impossible to control .
How is it diagnosed ?
No single test does the job .
Instead , the doc needs to know your symptoms .
Then she 'll check your reproductive organs for signs of masses or growths using a pelvic or vaginal ultrasound and physical exam .
Blood tests are used to measure levels of glucose and several hormones ; they also can exclude abnormalities , like hypothyroidism , that mimic PCOS .
How is it treated ?
There 's no cure , so treatment is designed to manage the symptoms and prevent infertility , diabetes , or heart disease .
Birth control pills help regulate menstrual cycles , lower androgen levels , reduce hair growth , and clear up acne .
Metformin , which controls blood glucose and lowers testosterone production , can help you lose weight .
2. Fibromyalgia
What is it , and who gets it ?
Doctors are n't sure what causes the widespread pain that characterizes this disorder .
They think the brains of people with fibromyalgia -- 3 million to 6 million women in the United States alone -- may interpret ordinary sensation as painful , what 's known as central sensitivity syndrome .
How does it feel ?
Symptoms , which usually develop during early and middle adulthood , include pain , numbness , and exhaustion .
" It 's like someone has turned up the volume in the nervous system , " says Dr. Cassandra Curtis , a neurologist in Indianapolis who frequently treats fibromyalgia patients .
Health.com : Fibromyalgia pain :
What 's normal , what 's not
How is it diagnosed ?
A physical exam and lab tests can't find fibromyalgia , says Dr. James Leisen , division head of the department of rheumatology at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit , Michigan .
Instead , doctors check for widespread pain lasting at least three months and do a tender - point exam , which identifies places on your body that are painful to the touch despite no signs of redness or swelling ; the test is positive if at least 11 of the 18 points are tender .
How is it treated ?
Over - the - counter pain meds like acetaminophen , ibuprofen , and naproxen , as well as antidepressants ( to treat pain and improve sleep patterns ) are recommended .
A prescription drug called Lyrica is helpful in some cases .
Studies show that exercise helps , but it 's important to go slow with a workout program .
Massage , stretching , and any kind of stress relief may ease the hurt .
" If patients are upset and emotional , the pain becomes worse , " Leisen says .
3. Chronic fatigue syndrome
What is it , and who gets it ?
Nobody knows what causes the extreme fatigue common to chronic fatigue syndrome .
But studies point to dormant viral infections , hormonal imbalance , and stress .
At least 1 million Americans are believed to have CFS , though less than 20 percent have been diagnosed .
Women , especially in their 40s and 50s , are four times as likely as men to have it .
" It may have something to do with hormonal changes and menopause , " says integrative medicine expert Dr. Erika Schwartz , medical director of Cinergy Health , who treats women with hormonal disorders .
How does it feel ?
The fatigue usually worsens with physical or mental activity and does n't improve with rest , so people with CFS often function at a substantially lower level than they did before getting sick .
Tasks like getting ready for the day or cleaning a room , which usually require an hour , may take several hours , if not days .
Loss of memory or concentration and unexplained muscle pain are common , too .
How is it diagnosed ?
There 's no test , so before arriving at the diagnosis , a doctor will rule out other diseases or conditions that may cause similar symptoms -- like mononucleosis , Lyme disease , thyroid problems , or depression .
Health.com : 8 Causes of chronic cough
How is it treated ?
A 2006 study found that psychostimulants like Ritalin lessen fatigue and improve concentration in some people , but the treatment is experimental .
Most docs suggest moderate daily activity and exercise to boost stamina , plus more rest , and stress , alcohol , and caffeine reduction .
Schwartz also prescribes bioidentical hormones : " Many patients improve when their hormones are balanced . "
4. Lupus
What is it , and who gets it ?
There are four types of lupus , but you hear most about systemic lupus erythematosus , a malfunction in the immune system in which your body becomes its own worst enemy .
Skin , joints , lungs , kidneys , the nervous system , or blood pay the price .
Each year , more than 16,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with lupus -- 90 percent of them are women .
Scientists suspect that hormones play a role because most women are diagnosed between ages 15 and 45 , and lupus seems to strike during or following pregnancy .
How does it feel ?
Symptoms include fatigue , fever , joint pain and stiffness , chest pain , memory loss , and skin lesions .
Most people experience flares -- worsening of symptoms that may later improve or even disappear completely .
How is it diagnosed ?
Lupus is confirmed if you have at least four of these symptoms : a facial rash or rashes that appear after exposure to sunlight , painless mouth sores , kidney disease , swelling of the lining around the lungs or heart , and low counts of red blood cells , platelets , or white blood cells .
How is it treated ?
For mild cases , ibuprofen and naproxen can reduce pain and swelling in joints and muscles , and antimalarial drugs like Plaquenil ( generic : hydroxychloroquine ) have proven useful in preventing flares and controlling the disease 's progression .
Corticosteroids counter inflammation , but they can have long - term side effects .
Increased physical activity and emotional stress may trigger an episode , too , so learning to balance activities and emotions is an important part of coping with lupus .
Diets rich in omega - 3 fatty acids and alpha-linolenic acid ( found in flaxseed ) may also help reduce inflammation associated with the disease .
5. Multiple sclerosis
What is it , and who gets it ?
Multiple sclerosis strikes when your immune system attacks the protective covering of the nerves ( called myelin ) in the brain and nervous system , breaking down communication between the brain and body and sometimes destroying the nerves themselves .
Women are three times as likely to be diagnosed with MS , and it generally appears between ages 20 and 40 .
One in 1,000 people develop the disease , and the risk is higher if there 's a family history of it .
Most scientists believe there 's an environmental link , like viruses or toxins .
How does it feel ?
Early symptoms can include numbness or weakness in one or more limbs , tingling or dull pain , fatigue , and vision problems .
MS may seem benign ( with few or no symptoms ) or completely disabling , and researchers can't tell how a person 's disease will progress .
Some sufferers , like talk - show host Montel Williams and actress Teri Garr , maintain a relatively normal life ; others find themselves needing constant assistance as the disease progresses .
" They 're working two to three times as hard as the normal person to get through the day , " says Dr. Jerry Wolinsky , director of the Multiple Sclerosis Research Group at the University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston .
How is it diagnosed ?
There are no definitive tests for MS , although in recent years doctors have begun using optical coherence tomography to analyze nerves in the retina .
Other tests are used to help rule out conditions with MS - like symptoms -- blood tests for infectious or inflammatory diseases like Lyme disease , spinal taps for viral infections .
An MRI can sometimes uncover lesions , which indicates that the myelin is deteriorating .
How is it treated ?
Some people have mild symptoms and can be treated just with corticosteroids .
But most sufferers are put on an immunomodulator drug like interferon beta or glatiramer acetate to reduce the likelihood of relapse .
Rest is crucial , and occasional exercise can improve strength , muscle tone , coordination , and balance .
It 's also important to stay out of the heat , because it may trigger extreme muscle weakness .
Read how yoga can help ease MS symptoms .
6. Rheumatoid arthritis
What is it , and who gets it ?
Rheumatoid arthritis attacks the linings of the joints ( called synovium ) via the immune system , causing swelling , aching , and potential deformity in hands , wrists , hips , knees , and feet .
Women make up three - quarters of RA cases ( about 1 million in the United States ) .
Symptoms occur at any age but generally peak between 40 and 60 .
How does it feel ?
RA can make even the simplest activities -- opening jars , climbing stairs , putting on clothes -- difficult and painful .
" It also has the curious propensity to be symmetrical :
If one joint on one side of the body is involved , the other joint on the other side will usually be involved as well , " Leisen says .
Other symptoms include stiffness ( especially after waking ) , joints that are tender to the touch , fatigue , and fever .
Women typically find that RA goes into remission while they 're pregnant but returns after giving birth .
How is it diagnosed ?
RA can be difficult to diagnose in its earlier stages .
Symptoms can be similar to other types of arthritis -- there are 212 in all -- and may not show up for years .
Blood tests , which look for an antibody called rheumatoid factor ( present in 80 percent of RA patients ) may be ordered .
Two tests that measure inflammation -- C - reactive protein and sedimentation rate ( for measuring how fast red blood cells fall to the bottom of a test tube ) -- may also be done .
X - rays are taken over time to determine the level of joint deterioration , because the disease may not show up at first .
How is it treated ?
In recent years , tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors , drugs that fight an inflammatory protein , and DMARDs ( disease modifying antirheumatic drugs like methotrexate ) have helped slow , reduce , and prevent joint damage .
Corticosteroids can cut inflammation , though they may become less effective over time and do n't halt disease progression .
High doses of omega - 3 supplements might ease the pain and stiffness , too , some experts believe .
7. Irritable bowel syndrome
What is it , and who gets it ?
Irritable bowel syndrome -- chronic abdominal cramping and pain , bloating , gas , diarrhea , and constipation -- may be caused by a malfunction in the way the brain and gut communicate , says Dr. David Greenwald , associate director of the division of gastroenterology at the Montefiore Medical Center in Bronx , New York .
Up to 20 % of Americans have IBS , but it 's twice as common in women .
Researchers think a woman 's menstrual cycle may be partly responsible .
How does it feel ?
Some people experience only diarrhea ; others , only constipation .
You might have a little of everything -- including big - time pain .
Fatty , greasy foods and dairy products can cause IBS to flare up or worsen .
Coffee , alcohol , and caffeine can lead to loose stools or diarrhea .
How is it diagnosed ?
Your doc may use what 's called the Rome criteria to make a diagnosis ; one criterion is 12 weeks of symptoms in 12 months .
How is it treated ?
Fiber ( the kind found in many fruits and vegetables including broccoli , cabbage , cauliflower , and in whole - grain breads ) or fiber supplements add bulk to the stool , making it easier for some to go .
But too much fiber may worsen symptoms , especially bloating and gas .
Antidepressants ( in much lower doses than used for treating psychological conditions ) may help slow down the neurons that control the intestines and decrease the bothersome sensations linked to bloating and gas .
Research also suggests that peppermint , a natural antispasmodic , sometimes can ease abdominal pain .
Even hypnotherapy may be useful ; check IBShypnosis.com for therapists .

To ease the burdens of the insurance mandate , the reform proposals call for varying levels of subsidy .
In some versions , such as the current Senate bill , subsidies are handed out to families with incomes as high as $ 88,000 a year .
How long will it be before just about everyone wants further assistance , and this new form of entitlement spending spins out of control ?
It ’s possible to lower insurance subsidies , but then the insurance mandate would impose a bigger burden on the people we are trying to help .
A subtler problem is what economists call “ implicit marginal tax rates . ”
The fiscal reality is that not all income groups can receive equal subsidies ; as a family earns more , its subsidy would probably decrease , eventually falling to zero .
But then we are taking money away from the poor as they climb into higher income categories .
This is a disincentive to earn more , and the strength of the disincentive increases with our initial generosity .
For many people , the health insurance aid would phase out when food stamps , housing vouchers and the earned income tax credit also end and the personal income tax kicks in .
This structure of incentives would likely discourage many parents from earning a better life for their children .
Congress could tweak the subsidies so they do n’t phase out so quickly , but then we ’re back to very high fiscal costs and subsidies for many families in the higher income classes .
Defenders of a broad health insurance mandate argue that it will lower average costs in the health care market .
The claim is that many of the uninsured are young , healthy or both , and that bringing them into the insurance pool might lower average premiums by spreading risk across low - cost groups .
Yet Massachusetts has had a health insurance mandate for several years and this cost - saving mechanism does not appear to be kicking in .
At this point , it seems more plausible that the cost of health insurance will keep rising , just as the costs of health care services have continued to climb .
The upshot is that the burdens of mandatory purchase , the subsidy costs and the associated implicit marginal tax rates will all increase , eventually to the point of unsustainability .
I noticed something funny when I looked at the text of John Boehner 's " Defund ACORN " bill .
In order to not look like an unconstitutional bill of attainder , look how broadly the bolded language sweeps :
SEC .
2 . PROHIBITIONS ON FEDERAL FUNDS AND OTHER ACTIVITIES WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN INDICTED ORGANIZATIONS .
( a ) Prohibitions -
With respect to any covered organization , the following prohibitions apply : ( 1 ) No Federal contract , grant , cooperative agreement , or any other form of agreement ( including a memorandum of understanding ) may be awarded to or entered into with the organization .
( 2 ) No Federal funds in any other form may be provided to the organization .
( 3 ) No Federal employee or contractor may promote in any way ( including recommending to a person or referring to a person for any purpose ) the organization .
( b ) Covered Organization -
In this section , the term `covered organization ' means any of the following : ( 1 ) Any organization that has been indicted for a violation under any Federal or State law governing the financing of a campaign for election for public office or any law governing the administration of an election for public office , including a law relating to voter registration .
( 2 ) Any organization that had its State corporate charter terminated due to its failure to comply with Federal or State lobbying disclosure requirements .
( 3 ) Any organization that has filed a fraudulent form with any Federal or State regulatory agency .
( 4 ) Any organization that -- ( A ) employs any applicable individual , in a permanent or temporary capacity ; ( B ) has under contract or retains any applicable individual ; or ( C ) has any applicable individual acting on the organization 's behalf or with the express or apparent authority of the organization ....
(3) The term `applicable individual ' means an individual who has been indicted for a violation under Federal or State law relating to an election for Federal or State office .
Really ?
" Any organization that has filed a fraudlulent form with any Federal or State regulatory agency " can no longer receive federal funds ?
( And individuals who 've merely been indicted for election law violations , whether or not the charges were proven ? )
The bill further defines " organization " as including ACORN and its affiliates , but it does n't say it only includes ACORN - related entities .
So , gosh , I imagined , there 's a lot of entities that suddenly qualify .
As Ryan Grim reports on HuffPo today , Rep. Alan Grayson had the same thought :
The congressional legislation intended to defund ACORN , passed with broad bipartisan support , is written so broadly that it applies to " any organization " that has been charged with breaking federal or state election laws , lobbying disclosure laws , campaign finance laws or filing fraudulent paperwork with any federal or state agency .
It also applies to any of the employees , contractors or other folks affiliated with a group charged with any of those things .
In other words , the bill could plausibly defund the entire military - industrial complex .
Whoops .
Rep. Alan Grayson ( D - Fla . ) picked up on the legislative overreach and asked the Project on Government Oversight ( POGO ) to sift through its database to find which contractors might be caught in the ACORN net .
Lockheed Martin and Northrop Gumman both popped up quickly , with 20 fraud cases between them , and the longer list is a Who 's Who of weapons manufacturers and defense contractors .
The bill -- crafted as a motion to recommit -- has already cleared the Senate and House , so what Rep.
Grayson intends is to file a list of all applicable entities in the legislative history that goes along with the bill so that judges can reference it when determining whether a company should be denied federal funds .
Help build the list .
As Rep. Grayson suggests , we can't leave anyone out :
You see , regardless of what you think of ACORN , it is laudable to stop taxpayer money from going to organizations that commit fraud against the government .
So as per the bill 's text , I 'm going to put into the Congressional record a list of organizations who have committed fraud against the government or employs anyone who has .
Now , I 'm just one person , and I can't possibly find and list all of the organizations that fit this bill .
So I need your help .
Please nominate organizations and show me that they need to be in the record .
To help , send me the name of the organization and proof in the form of a link to evidence that this organization should be in the Congressional record .
I will also need your email address so I can follow - up with you if necessary .
The proof you send needs to be easily verifiable , as in credible media reports , legal documents , government data , or otherwise .
An example might work as follows .
Let 's say that you were nominating ' Blackwater , ' the controversial mercenary outfit which showed fraud in its contracts for Iraq in 2005 .
You could include a link like this one .
Help build the list .
Europe ’s center - right parties have embraced many ideas of the left : generous welfare benefits , nationalized health care , sharp restrictions on carbon emissions , the ceding of some sovereignty to the European Union .
But they have won votes by promising to deliver more efficiently than the left , while working to lower taxes , improve financial regulation , and grapple with aging populations .
Europe ’s conservatives , says Michel Winock , a historian at the Paris Institut d’Études Politiques , “ have adapted themselves to modernity . ”
When Nicolas Sarkozy of France and Germany ’s Angela Merkel condemn the excesses of the “ Anglo - Saxon model ” of capitalism while praising the protective power of the state , they are using Socialist ideas that have become mainstream , he said .
It is not that the left is irrelevant  it often represents the only viable opposition to established governments , and so benefits , as in the United States , from the normal cycle of electoral politics .
In Portugal , the governing Socialists won re-election on Sunday , but lost an absolute parliamentary majority .
In Spain , the Socialists still get credit for opposing both Franco and the Iraq war .
In Germany , the broad left , including the Greens , has a structural majority in Parliament , but the Social Democrats , in postelection crisis , must contemplate allying with the hard left , Die Linke , which has roots in the old East German Communist Party .
Part of the problem is the “ wall in the head ” between East and West Germans .
While the Christian Democrats moved smoothly eastward , the Social Democrats of the West never joined with the Communists .
“ The two Germanys , one Socialist , one Communist  two souls  never really merged , ” said Giovanni Sartori , a professor emeritus at Columbia University .
“ It explains why the S.P.D. , which was always the major Socialist party in Europe , cannot really coalesce . ”
Open - source camera could revolutionize digital photography
Stanford scientists ' open - source camera could change photography by giving programmers anywhere the power to change camera features and create new possibilities .
L.A. Cicero Marc Levoy , professor of Computer Science and of Electrical Engineering and graduate student Andrew Adams with the open source camera .
Stanford photo scientists are out to reinvent digital photography with the introduction of an open - source digital camera , which will give programmers around the world the chance to create software that will teach cameras new tricks .
If the technology catches on , camera performance will be no longer be limited by the software that comes pre-installed by the manufacturer .
Virtually all the features of the Stanford camera – focus , exposure , shutter speed , flash , etc. – are at the command of software that can be created by inspired programmers anywhere .
“ The premise of the project is to build a camera that is open source , ” said computer science professor Marc Levoy .
Computer science graduate student Andrew Adams , who helped design the prototype of the Stanford camera ( dubbed Frankencamera , ) imagines a future where consumers download applications to their open - platform cameras the way Apple apps are downloaded to iPhones today .
When the camera ’s operating software is made available publicly , perhaps a year from now , users will be able to continuously improve it , along the open - source model of the Linux operating system for computers or the Mozilla Firefox web browser .
From there , the sky ’s the limit .
Programmers will have the freedom to experiment with new ways of tuning the camera ’s response to light and motion , adding their own algorithms to process the raw images in innovative ways .
Frankencamera at minimal cost
Levoy ’s plan is to develop and manufacture the “ Frankencamera ” as a platform that will first be available at minimal cost to fellow computational photography researchers .
In the young field of computational photography , which Levoy helped establish , researchers use optics benches , imaging chips , computers and software to develop techniques and algorithms to enhance and extend photography .
This work , however , is bound to the lab .
Frankencamera would give researchers the means to take their experiments into the studios , the landscapes , and the stadiums .
Stefan Gustafsson Animation demonstrating one example of how the Frankencamera extends and enhances photography .
For example , among the most mature ideas in the field of computational photography is the idea of extending a camera ’s “ dynamic range , ” or its ability to handle a wide range of lighting in a single frame .
The process of high - dynamic - range imaging is to capture pictures of the same scene with different exposures and then to combine them into a composite image in which every pixel is optimally lit .
Until now , this trick could be done only with images in computers .
Levoy wants cameras to do this right at the scene , on demand .
Although the algorithms are very well understood , no commercial cameras do this today .
But Frankencamera does .
Another algorithm that researchers have achieved in the lab , but no commercial camera allows , is enhancing the resolution of videos with high - resolution still photographs .
While a camera is gathering low - resolution video at 30 frames a second , it could also periodically take a high - resolution still image .
The extra information in the still could then be recombined by an algorithm into each video frame .
Levoy and his students plan to implement that on Frankencamera , too .
Yet another idea is to have the camera communicate with computers on a network , such as a photo - hosting service on the Web .
Imagine , Levoy says , if the camera could analyze highly - rated pictures of a subject in an online gallery before snapping the shutter for another portrait of the same subject .
The camera could then offer advice ( or just automatically decide ) on the settings that will best replicate the same skin tone or shading .
By communicating with the network , the camera could avoid taking a ghastly picture .
Of course users with Frankencameras would not be constrained by what is already known .
They ’d be free to discover and experiment with all kinds of other operations that might yield innovative results because they ’d have total control .
" Some cameras have software development kits that let you hook up a camera with a USB cable and tell it to set the exposure to this , the shutter speed to that , and take a picture , but that ’s not what we ’re talking about , " says Levoy .
" What we ’re talking about is , tell it what to do on the next microsecond in a metering algorithm or an autofocusing algorithm , or fire the flash , focus a little differently and then fire the flash again — things you ca n’t program a commercial camera to do . "
Behind the lens cap
To create an open - source camera , Levoy and the group cobbled together a number of different parts : the motherboard , per se , is a Texas Instruments " system on a chip " running Linux with image and general processors and a small LCD screen .
The imaging chip is taken from a Nokia N95 cell phone , and the lenses are off - the - shelf Canon lenses , but they are combined with actuators to give the camera its fine - tuned software control .
The body is custom made at Stanford .
The project has benefited from the support of Nokia , Adobe Systems , Kodak , and Hewlett - Packard .
HP recently gave graduate student David Jacobs a three - year fellowship to support his work on the project .
Kodak , meanwhile , supports student Eddy Talvala .
Within about a year , after the camera is developed to his satisfaction , Levoy hopes to have to have the funding and the arrangements in place for an outside manufacturer to produce them in quantity , ideally for less than $ 1,000 .
Levoy would then provide them at cost to colleagues and their students at other universities .
The son , grandson , and great - grandson of opticians , Levoy sees his mission as not only advancing research in computational photography , but also imbuing new students with enthusiasm for technology .
This spring he launched a course in digital photography in which he integrated the science of optics and algorithms and the history of photography ’s social significance with lessons in photographic technique .
As many ideas as Levoy ’s team may want to implement on the camera , the real goal is to enable the broader community of photography researchers and enthusiasts to contribute ideas the Stanford group has not imagined .
The success of Camera 2.0 will be measured by how many new capabilities the community can add to collective understanding of what ’s possible in photography .

There are plenty of strange animals living today , but few people know how odd some of the creatures of the past were .
Here is a list of fifteen such creatures , ranging from dinosaurs to various other reptiles and fish .
All are unseen by modern man ( except in the form of fossils ) and all are bizarre .
In no particular order .
15 Deinotherium
This genus of elephant - like creatures was not only huge , but they also had a pair of chin tusks .
These odd tusks might have been used to dig up the soil to gain access to roots and vegetables .
They also had a relatively short trunk compared to other Proboscideans .
They ranged from 12 - 15 feet high , making them one of the largest mammals to ever walk on the earth .
14 Therizinosauridaes
This family of strange , mysterious theropods was notable for their long necks and their large claws .
However , unlike most other theropods , they were herbivores ( or at least primarily ) .
Some of them may have had feathers .
The genus that the family is named after , Therizinosaurus , is actually only known from a few fossils , but its claws were quite large , likely reaching a meter in length .
13 Epidexipteryx
This bird - like dinosaur reveals an interesting part about the evolutionary history of birds .
This member of the Scansoriopterygidae ( “ climbing wings ” ) had no flight feathers , but it did have four long tail feathers .
These feathers were likely used in displays .
Due to its age ( It lived in China around 152 to 168 million years ago ) , it provides evidence that feathers evolved several million years before flight did ( not surprisingly ) .
It was also one of the smallest dinosaurs , reaching just 10 inches in height as an adult ( not counting its feathers ) .
That ’s the size of a pigeon .
12 Epidendrosaurus
Another bird - like dinosaur , this one belonged in the same family as Epidexipteryx .
It is currently the earliest dinosaur known to have adapted for life in the trees , an important moment in the evolution of birds .
More bizarrely , this dinosaur had an oddly long third finger , twice the length of the other ones .
They may have been used to dig for insects .
11 Microraptor
Yet another bird - like dinosaur , this dinosaur had four wings ( and a feathered tail ) , although it could not fly .
Instead , it likely glided from place to place , kind of like a flying squirrel .
It is likely that this creature is one of the most recent common ancestors between birds and dinosaurs , its gliding ability eventually evolving into flight .
Unfortunately for the genus , one fossil was used in a forgery , along with a fossil of a primitive bird , Yanornis , to create a fake fossil that was said to be the ultimate missing link between birds and dinosaurs : Archeoraptor .
Although it could have been caught before the public noticed , it was published in National Geographic before it could be peer reviewed .
When it was exposed for the fraud it was quite embarrassing to the scientific community .
There are two species of Microraptor .
10 Longisquama
Living during the Triassic , Longisquama was a small , lizard like creature that appears to have had a series of long feathers on its back .
This implies that birds might have not evolved from theropods , but lizard - like reptiles instead .
Of course , things are not always what they seem .
Some scientists think they are just specially modified scales .
Others think that the fossil ’s form is an optical illusion : that the feathers are just fern fronds .
Due to the large amount of feathered dinosaur fossils , it seems that these two possibilities are more accurate .
9 Tanystropheus
When I describe a long necked reptile , most people think of sauropods or even plesiosaurs .
This Triassic reptile was neither of these .
This reptile was 20 feet long , yet had a 10 foot long neck !
Evidence indicates that this was a fish - eating reptile , since fossils of it have been found in mainly partially aquatic fossil sites and fish scales and Cephalopod tentacles have been found in their stomachs .
They might have stayed on the beach , using their long necks to help them devour fish from the sea .
It is also thought to have been at least semi-aquatic .
8 Sharovipteryx
Another gliding reptile , this Triassic critter glided similarly to Microraptor .
However , Sharovipteryx had two “ wings ” on its hind legs and two small “ wings ” on its front legs .
It might have used its wings while jumping from place to place on the ground .
Some scientists think it was related to Pterosaurs , but its reversal of wings to its legs instead of arms questions this .
7 Nyctosaurus
This genus of pterosaurs is the only one that does not have claws on its wings .
Otherwise , most species looked quite average , similar to the famous Pterodon … until a new , currently unnamed species was discovered in 2003 .
The species had a huge , antler - like crest , larger than any other pterosaurs crest .
Some speculated that there was a flap of tissue in between these antlers , like some other pterosaurs , which could have been used like a sail to enhance its flight .
However , research shows that a crest that large would actually impair its flight , so it likely just had an odd set of antlers .
6 Pterodaustro
This pterosaur had an unusual set of teeth , similar to the baleen of some whales .
It almost certainly used these teeth to eat small , aquatic organisms , similar to the way a flamingo eats brine shrimp .
Since flamingos get their pinkish hue from their diet , Pterodaustro might have been pinkish too .
5 Dunkleosteus
One of the scariest creatures ever to live in the ocean , this Devonian fish could grow up to 33 feet long , had an armored face , and likely had one of the strongest bites in history !
It used a beak - like mouth instead of teeth to devourer its prey .
It was one of the largest of the Placoderms , a group of armored fish that are now extinct .
4 Stethacanthus
Sharks have lasted for over 400 million years .
Although they have remained relatively unchanged throughout the fossil record , there are definitely some odd balls .
This particular shark had an anvil - shaped dorsal fin , with small spikes on it , as well as having a very bizarre growth on its head .
The fin could have been used for courtship or for defense .
3 Helicoprion
This bizarre fossil was originally thought to be an ammonite , as the fossil looked like a spiraling , circular shell .
However , after some examination , it was revealed that is was n’t a shell , but a spiraling set of shark teeth , a “ tooth whirl ” .
Unfortunately , due to a lack of a body ( cartilage does not fossilize as well as bone ) , so a guessing game began .
It was guessed to be on the shark ’s dorsal fin , tail , or even its snout .
Thankfully , a skull of a related shark , Ornithoprion , was found to have a tooth - whirl on its lower jaw .
The tooth whirl likely contained all of the shark ’s teeth that it would use in its life : its older teeth would be moved away to make room for its newer , better teeth .
This does not solve the problem yet , however !
The tooth whirl was then placed on the tip of the lower jaw but it turns out that that would actually slow down the shark !
Perhaps the most accurate representation is one where the tooth whirl existed deep in its mouth instead .
2 Deinocheirus
The only fossil of this dinosaur is a pair of arms .
These arms look like they belonged to an ornithomimid but they were 8 feet long .
This means that either Deinocheirus towered over the rest of the ornithomimids ( and most theropods , since , regarding proportions , it would have been 40 feet long ! ) or it simply had very long arms for its body .
The use of its arms is debated : some say it used them to tear apart large dinosaurs , others say that the claws were too blunt , so they were used as defensive weapons .
Some have even said that Deinocheirus used its huge arms to climb trees , although this hypothesis is widely disregarded .
Once again , the lack of a body leaves many questions unanswered .
1 Amphicoelias fragillimus
This elusive fossil was discovered by the famed paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope , the same man who competed with Othniel Charles Marsh in the infamous “ Bone Wars ” .
Cope discovered many prehistoric fossils , but this one is , by far , the oddest .
The only fossil that exists of it was a single vertebra fragment .
It was 5 feet high , estimated to be 8.8 feet high if the entire fossil was intact .
Compare that to your vertebrae .
Yeah .
Estimates vary , but they range from 131 to 196 feet in length , making it , by far , the longest creature ever , competing with the blue whale for being the heaviest creature ever ( along with another , very elusive sauropd , Bruhathkayosaurus ) .
But , as luck would have it , the fossil just disappeared .
It vanished without a trace .
Was it a hoax ?
A misconception ?
Or was it really the largest animal to ever walk the earth ?
Sadly , we will probably never know .
Though the most popular vehicle destroyed under Cash For Clunkers was the Ford Explorer , there were also AMGs , Rolls - Royces and even a LaForza crushed .

John is trying to get a voter 's initiative onto the 2010 ballot here in California .
In early September , I heard Sacramento's own John Marcotte had filed a petition with the California Secratary of State .
Stung by punishing losses in the bear market , some individual investors are souring on traditional buy - and - hold investing in favor of aggressive trading aimed at scoring big gains .
Trading at online brokerages has soared in recent months as investors have tried to capitalize on rising securities markets .
But individual investors increasingly are embracing strategies that carry outsized risks .
In some cases , for example , investors have ventured into a relatively new type of investment product designed to magnify the movement of the underlying markets .
That can sometimes yield big gains if investors bet correctly but bruising losses if they do n’t .
To critics , the push into aggressive trading is the equivalent of doubling down at a casino to recoup earlier losses .

“ It would be a terrible tragedy if people try to recover from the devastation of the financial crisis by creating even more devastation in their personal investment accounts by taking on risks they do n’t understand and can’t afford , ” said Barbara Roper , director of investor protection for the Consumer Federation of America .
Financial experts have long preached portfolio diversification , caution and patience when it comes to long - term investing .
Still , some individuals feel they have no choice but to take matters into their own hands .
Two brutal bear markets -- after the bursting of the dot - com bubble in 2000 and the housing bubble two years ago -- have decimated portfolios and left many people poorer than a decade ago .
Some have grown disillusioned with losses incurred by mutual funds and stock brokers , and figure they ca n’t do any worse on their own by darting in and out based on market conditions .

“ The equity markets have not been steady long - term gainers for a long time now , ” said Nicholas Colas , market strategist at BNY ConvergEx Group , a New York brokerage .
“ There is a growing sense of frustration , and [ investors feel that ] if you do want to play in equities you have to have a shorter time frame . ”
Susan York was fed up with the dismal performance of her 401 ( k ) retirement account .
Then her husband saw a Sunday morning infomercial in January touting the benefits of trading options , which give an investor the right to buy or sell stocks and other securities at pre-determined prices .
The 50 - year - old from Naples , Fla. , had limited investment knowledge but attended several seminars before starting to trade in May .
So far , York said , she ’s up an average of 40 % a month and is trading full time .
“ It ’s the best job I ’ve ever had , not just for the enjoyment but from the compensation standpoint , ” said York , who previously sold telecom equipment .
“ I ’ve replaced a significant six - figure income . ”

Trading activity at online brokerages jumped in the second quarter as the stock market began rebounding in early March from its deep sell - off .
Compared with a year earlier , activity was up 28 % at E - Trade Financial Corp. and 36 % at TD Ameritrade Holding Corp .
Frenetic trading also is rising among Wall Street professionals .
So - called high - frequency trading , which involves souped - up computers trading stocks in milliseconds , makes up at least half of total trading volume , according to some estimates .
Among individuals , activity is picking up in some risky areas .

Currency trading by so - called retail investors , for example , is expected to jump to $ 125 billion a day this year from $ 100 billion last year , according to Aite Group , a research firm .
It has risen steadily from $ 10 billion in 2001 .
Some individuals recently have jumped into one of the newest and riskiest investment products , known as leveraged exchange - traded funds .
ETFs are mutual funds that trade like stocks and can be bought and sold throughout the day .
A leveraged ETF is like a regular fund on steroids .
It gives two to three times the return of an underlying stock index .
For example , if financial shares rise 2 % on a given day , a fund could jump as much as 6 % .
Some leveraged funds move in the opposite direction of an index .
If an index rose 2 % , an inverse fund could fall up to 6 % .
Leveraged funds are one of the fastest - growing products on Wall Street .
Total assets surged to $ 32 billion at the end of June from $ 11 billion 18 months earlier , according to State Street Global Advisors .
The first leveraged fund debuted three years ago .
There are now 126 .
However , there is mounting concern that small investors do n’t understand the risks of leveraged funds .
In some cases , critics say , they have suffered sharp and unexpected losses .

According to a lawsuit filed this month by a Connecticut stock broker , one fund was supposed to return two times the inverse performance of an index of real - estate stocks .
Thus , the ProShare Advisors ’ UltraShort Real Estate Fund should have risen if the index declined , according to the suit .
But even though the index sank 39 % through much of last year , the fund also fell , by 48 % , according to the suit .
“ This should have been an extraordinary home run , and yet he lost money , ” said the stock broker ’s lawyer , Thomas Grady .
“ It ’s just preposterous . ”
Many other funds have suffered similar fates , according to researcher Morningstar Inc .
Advertisement
Over the last year , 55 % of leveraged ETFs have gone in the opposite direction from what would have been expected , said Scott Burns , a Morningstar analyst .
The reason is that the funds are designed to track daily market moves but can fluctuate wildly over longer periods .
ProShare “ touts the simplicity ” of the funds when there are actually enormous risks , the suit said .
ProShare said in a statement that the allegations are “ wholly without merit . ”
Advertisement
Fund companies say they warn investors about the danger in holding the funds for extended periods .
“ I think we ’ve done a very good job in disclosing what these funds are , what they ’re not , and what they do and do n’t do , ” said Michael Sapir , chairman of ProShare Advisors .
Still , leveraged funds are raising concerns among securities regulators .
Massachusetts issued subpoenas to four brokerages late last month to determine whether investors were being adequately warned of the risks .
Some firms have suspended sales of the products while others have issued warnings to customers .
Advertisement
Still , experts worry that some individuals , in their haste to recover bear - market losses , are rushing in blindly .
“ People should n’t be messing around with stuff they do n’t understand , ” Burns said .
But individuals such as York believe that doing nothing is riskier than taking action themselves .
She has devoted a lot of time , she said , to understanding how options trading works and believes she can prosper in good markets or bad .
“ I saw with my 401 ( k ) , ” she said , “ that buying and holding was just not working out . ”

Der Bund Deutscher Kriminalbeamter ( BDK ) erneuert anlässlich seines gerade stattfindenden Bundesdelegiertentages in Suhl seine Forderung nach dem Notruf - Button für Browser .
Damit möchten die Kriminalpolizisten wirksam Web - Angebote aufspüren , die zum Beispiel Kinderpornografie oder radikales Gedankengut verbreiten .
Auch schnelle Informationen an eine Clearing - Stelle etwa über Chatinhalte mit Ankündigungen von Suizid , Amoklauf oder verbaler beziehungsweise sexueller Belästigung innerhalb von Chatrooms haben die Kriminalbeamten im Visier .
Solche Inhalte tauchen nicht nur versteckt oder auf eigenständigen Web - Sites auf , sondern dafür werden E - Mail , E - Government und Communities wie Facebook , Youtube , Studi - und SchülerVZ genutzt .
Dadurch gelangen Kinder und Jugendliche recht einfach an Inhalte wie Pornografie , Pädophilie oder Rechts - und Linksextremismus .
Über die Initiative web - patrol , die den Notruf - Button ins Leben rufen will , hat heise online bereits im Juni berichtet .
Von den unzähligen Taten , die im weltweiten Netz verübt werden , würden die meisten nicht angezeigt .
" Es gibt fast kein Risiko auf Täterseite " , sagte der auf dem Bundesdelegiertentag wiedergewählte Bundesvorsitzende Klaus Jansen zu dpa .
Zudem gestalteten sich die polizeilichen Ermittlungen schwierig , da Kriminelle im Internet weder Fingerabdrücke noch DNA - Spuren hinterlassen .
In Deutschland gebe es rund 42 Millionen Internetnutzer .
Die polizeiliche Kriminalstatistik weise unter " Tatmittel Internet " aber nur knapp 167.500 Straftaten sowie mehr als 63.600 Fälle von Computerkriminalität aus .
Diese Zahlen bildeten nicht im entferntesten die Realität ab . ( gr )

The internet is the nearest thing to a libertarian utopia in the history of the world .
It creates the closest thing we have seen to a frictionless market , a perfectly free market – and it is , for the most part , tax free .
It allows the closest thing we have to maximum free speech and freedom from censorship .
It allows every individual a platform to be themselves , or whatever else they choose to be .
It circumvents and undermines governments that attempt to control it .
It was created to allow for the maximum of freedom with a minimum of cost .
It is resistant to centralized control – and makes it more and more possible to decentralize power .
It has unleashed the forces of innovation and creativity that libertarian theory has always posited would come with freedom .
It is perhaps the greatest force for expanding liberty in the world since the American revolution ( or the fall of Communism . )
How did the internet develop this way ?
How did this profoundly destabilizing and decentralized network develop ?
Was it some Galtian genius who set up servers on cargo ships in international waters ?
Was it some giant corporation which decided it could profit from it ?
Not quite .
And perhaps the story of how the internet developed helps explain why is it that liberals and not libertarians are the ones defending the internet .
Government engineers designed the internet as a network that was decentralized and thus “ network neutral , ” so as to be resistant to a nuclear assault on the United States .
It was designed to be adaptable .
Many academics worked on the project on behalf of the government – and were among the first to gain access to it .
The large corporations of the time that controlled America ’s communications grid – primarily AT&T – were resistant and attempted to strangle this competitor in its infancy , as they tried to discriminate against the data being sent over their lines .
Corporations , attempting to derive maximum profit from their assets , also attempted to exert maximum control .
AT&T only allowed “ authorized ” objects to connect to its network – and in fact people did not own their own phones .
They licensed them from AT&T .
Thus , it was only forceful intervention by the FCC that allowed the internet to develop , that opened up the communications network of the United States to innovation .
AT&T and other corporations , attempting to add to their profits , now seek to find another stream of revenue by undermining net neutrality , one of the foundational principles of the internet itself .
They seek to introduce new frictions into this nearly frictionless market and to prevent it from becoming so easily a platform for individuals .
Opponents of net neutrality claim that the several attempts by corporations to create policies that were contrary to net neutrality should be ignored because they did not succeed .
( They did not succeed because the FCC shut them down . )
They claim that there is no need to articulate clear principles about what net neutrality is because so far , the attempts to undermine it have failed .
They claim government regulation regarding this would retard “ innovation ” – when it was government intervention that in fact created the possibility for such innovation .
This libertarian utopia was created by government engineers and protected from powerful corporations by forceful regulation .
Many corporate libertarians ( such as Adam Thierer ) have embraced the fallacy that the government is the only threat to individual liberties , or at least that the government is always a greater threat to liberty than any other force .
They also often count corporations as “ individuals ” as they are considered such by the law .
Thus they have a knee jerk opposition to regulation of any sort – even regulation meant to allow their own values to flourish .
They favor freedom for corporations from government over freedom of individuals from corporations because they see the government as the primary evil in the world .
The are many different varieties of liberals , but the group of which I count myself believes that large corporations as well as government both are major threats to individual liberties .
We favor smart regulation that does not restrict individuals , but instead restricts corporations who often use their power and clout to deprive individuals of rights .
We agree with many libertarian attempts to constrain the government in the area of national security and attempts to make the government more transparent and accountable – but believe that government intervention in some form or another is often needed to restrain corporations from taking away the rights of individuals .
We realize that the free markets exist not in spite of the government but because of it , because of a balance between governmental intervention and the rights of individuals and the rights of corporations .

" We 've met with lawyers and are charting our course of action , " he added .
" This is not going to go away . "
" It breaks federal law , it breaks state law , " Levin told an audience at the Radio & Television News Assn. of Southern California .
" This is like ' Chinatown . '
It 's disgusting they would do something like this .
How do you protect sources ?
It goes to the core of freedom of the press . "
Harvey Levin , the founder of TMZ , expressed outrage over revelations in The Times earlier this month that the Los Angeles County Sheriff 's Department had obtained his telephone records as part of an investigation involving the leak of information about Mel Gibson 's arrest .
Several said they believed that sheriff 's investigators violated state and federal law when they obtained a search warrant for Levin 's records as they tried to identify who gave him details about Mel Gibson 's anti-Semitic tirade during a 2006 drunk - driving arrest .
" That 's illegal , " said Lucy Dalglish , an attorney and executive director of the Virginia - based Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press .
" Most law enforcement agencies know it 's illegal ... or have a hard time getting a judge signing off on it . "
Sheriff 's spokesman Steve Whitmore said at the time his department consulted a prosecutor before seeking the search warrant .
He noted that a judge approved the warrant .
Sheriff 's officials initially played down the July 28 , 2006 , arrest of Gibson , but later that day TMZ posted a story about the actor 's behavior .
The report detailed profane outbursts by Gibson , an attempt to escape custody and repeated threats against the arresting deputy .
The website also accused sheriff 's officials of trying to conceal the actor 's conduct from the public .
The news sparked outrage at the actor as well as fierce criticism of the Sheriff 's Department , which was accused of giving him special treatment .
[ Updated at 7:32 p.m. : Responding to Levin 's statements , Whitmore told The Times that he believes the department acted properly .
“ We believe the 1st Amendment is vital to keeping this country free , ” he said .
Levin declined to comment to The Times .
But during an interview on KCRW , Levin said he spoke to representatives of both the Sheriff ’s Department and district attorney 's office and that “ each kind of said the other was responsible . ”
Levin 's speech before the news group was first reported last night by L.A. Observed . ]

Mozilla executives today took shots at Google for pitching its Chrome Frame plug - in as a solution to Internet Explorer 's poor performance , with one arguing that Google 's move will result in " browser soup . "
The Mozilla reaction puts the company that builds Firefox on the same side of the debate as rival Microsoft , which has also blasted Google over the plug-in .
Released last week , Chrome Frame lets Internet Explorer 6 ( IE6 ) , IE7 and IE8 utilize the Chrome browser 's WebKit rendering engine , as well as its high - performance V8 JavaScript engine .
Google pitched the plug - in as a way to instantly improve the performance of the notoriously slow IE , and as a way for Web developers to support standards IE can't handle , including HTML 5 .
Specifically , said Google , it was pushing Chrome Frame because it decided it was n't worth trying to make its new collaboration and communications tool , Google Wave , work with IE .
Google developers spent " countless hours " on tweaking Wave for IE , but gave up .
" We could continue in this fashion , but using Google Chrome Frame instead lets us invest all that engineering time in more features for all our users , without leaving Internet Explorer users behind , " argued Lars Rasmussen and Adam Schuck of Google 's
Wave team last week .
Mitchell Baker , the former CEO of Mozilla and currently the chairman of the Mozilla Foundation , disagreed with Google 's tactic to slip Chrome inside IE .
Strongly .
" The overall effects of Chrome Frame are undesirable , " she said in an entry to her personal blog late Monday .
" I predict positive results will not be enduring and -- and to the extent it is adopted -- Chrome Frame will end in growing fragmentation and loss of control for most of us , including Web developers . "
According to Baker , Chrome Frame 's browser - in - a - browser will confuse users and render some of their familiar tools useless .
" Once your browser has fragmented into multiple rendering engines , it 's very hard to manage information across Web sites .
Some information will be manageable from the browser you use and some information from Chrome Frame .
This defeats one of the most important ways in which a browser can help people manage their [ Web ] experience . "

Here is a sampling of some of the things he heard :
We ’ve played some good hockey , had a few hiccups , but responded well after losses .
That ’s a big key .
You ’ve got to bounce back .
You want to string wins together as much as you can .
They all add up .
It ’s been a good start so far .
I think it ’s a little early for that .
I think last year ’s always a great thing to look back on , as far as lessons learned .
You can look at it the other way .
We had a really tough few months , especially the first half of the season .
We managed to turn things around .
Things can change in a hurry both ways .
I think it ’s important to realize that .
But we ’re certainly happy with the way we are playing .
The main thing is that we focus on making sure we improve .
As the season goes on we need to improve .
Other teams will improve .
That ’s got to be our mindset .
It was fun .
It ’s great when you can put the puck in the net and get some chances and generate a lot of offense .
Our line did a really good job of that .
I think , as far as our team ’s concerned , we played the way we wanted to .
We made it tough on them .
When you make it tough on other teams , usually it ’s a lot more fun to play that way .
It was a big win and we ’ll look to build off of it here .
We ’ve definitely had a good start here .
It ’s something that we ’re just trying to get better every game .
Wednesday was a pretty complete game from everybody for all 60 minutes , even with a couple guys out of the lineup .
It ’s a tough stretch of games here , three in four nights , but our focus will be there Friday and Saturday .
It ’s always a little more fun when you ’re winning .
So naturally you have a little bit of a swagger , a little extra confidence going into games .
For the most part , we have a good record , but I think it ’s far from our best hockey .
We ’ve been really good at times , but consistency has n’t always been there for 60 minutes .
Last night was probably as close as we ’ve been to a complete game .
There ’s lots of room for improvement , no matter what our record is .
They ’ve got a young team like we have the past couple years , a lot of good young guys there .
And obviously ( Steve ) Mason ’s a good goalie , and ( Mathieu ) Garon , who we all know from last year , a good backup goalie there .
It ’s a tough building to play in .
We had a pretty competitive one there last year .
It ’s a team that plays pretty similar to us so it should be a pretty good game .
It ’s a great start .
I ca n’t complain .
But I feel like it does n’t matter how you start it ’s how you finish .
I think we need to bring consistency to our game and make sure we play our game every game and elevate our game .
So by the end of the season we ’ll be playing our best .
We have a good system .
Everybody believes in it .
We just stick to it and good things happen .
When the goalie goes back there he ’s going for the puck , so he ca n’t really fight back .
Our goal is to win .
Our goal is to get a good place in the standings .
It ’s been going well .
Hopefully we can keep it the same and try to be constant .
I think you get a little more tired , just with the traveling .
We ’re just going to try to keep it simple and play our game .
It ’s been pretty awesome .
They ’ve been playing so well .
I know they ’ve been working hard in practices and games , to dive in front of shots , to block some shots for me .
I think we ’re able to move the puck out of the zone pretty quickly .
They ’re able to find each other , and not get trapped in our zone .
Playing with guys like Fedotenko and Malkin , it always makes things a lot easier .
I thought we played pretty good as a line and the team had a great game for us .
We do n’t really want to be in our own zone defensively .
It ’s always trying to get it out and get it back in the offensive zone and get some chances .
There ’s a lot of speed on this team and a lot of skill .
That really works in our favor .
It ’s definitely a fun system to play .
It ’s unbelievable .
The caliber of players we have here is unbelievable .
We ’ve got a pretty good record so far .
We ’ve definitely got to keep it going .
It ’s awesome .
He ’s a great player .
It was nice to see him get one .
He does so many other things that help his team out .
He ’s definitely going to get his goals .
I ’ve been given confidence to play and I ’m allowed to try to make plays .
I ’m playing with a great group of guys .
Our system is to go north - south and create offense , so I was able to benefit from it .
I ’ve actually played more center over my career than wing .
I ’m going to do want they want me to do .
It ’s really no adjustment .
I think so .
We came out and established ourselves early and we stuck with our game through 60 minutes .
We ’ve been winning a lot of hockey games this year .
I feel like we played the full 60 Wednesday night .
That ’s a team that ’s winning hockey games too .
It ’s a good club .
It ’ll be a nice little test for us on the road after being home for a while .
We ’re looking forward to getting out there and trying to get two points .
He ’s a guy that competes .
He moves real well in his crease .
It ’s someone that you want to get to early .
I think that if we can have one of our games where we can get 35 - plus shots our chances are pretty good .
It ’s definitely a promising start , but the hockey season ’s a long year .
Every year you see some teams come out of the gates with a little bit of vengeance , and then they tail off .
That ’s something we ’re not interested in doing .
We ’re going to do everything we can to maintain what we ’ve got going .
I think right now we ’ve got a good mindset .
It ’s a little cliché saying one game at a time , but I really feel that ’s how we ’re looking at it .
We ’ve got one game tomorrow night , Columbus , and then we ’ll go from there .
Chris Kunitz mentioned after the game against the Canadiens that his line with Sidney Crosby and Bill Guerin was trying to focus on keeping the third - man high lower in the attacking zone to better jump on loose pucks and sustain a longer forecheck .
“ We think we created more turnovers tonight because we were n’t keeping that third man so high , ” Kunitz said on Wednesday night .
“ We were kind of bouncing and jumping forward on opportunities – getting pucks to guys that were open and capitalizing when we had a chance to put the puck in the net .
” Crosby agreed with his left winger ’s assessment when broached about the subject after practice on Thursday .
“ It ’s just something over a period of the start of the season that there were certain points where we watched video and it seemed like there were times we could have kept plays alive and kept teams trapped a little more , ” Crosby said .
“ Even on two of the goals ( Wednesday ) night we got the time in zone .
That ’s all the reads from the forwards keeping plays alive .
” Crosby said that such a strategy was not something they talked about specifically against the Canadiens , nor were there any weaknesses in Montreal ’s zone coverage that were exposed on tape .
Instead the line was more focused on getting back to the way they want to play in the offensive end against any opponent after maybe getting away from it a bit the couple games prior to facing Montreal .
“ I think that ’s something that was kind of a reoccurring thing , ” Crosby said .
“ There were times when we could have kept pucks alive or kept teams in , but we kind of backed off a little bit and played it safe .
” As a line they generated plenty of attack time on Wednesday , enough to be able to combine for four goals , six assists and 13 shots on goal .
After their ’09 - 10 breakout performance , much will be asked of the unit the next couple weeks as the Penguins experience life without Evgeni Malkin .
If Wednesday was any indication , they will be up to the task .
Here is the longer version of head coach Dan Bylsma 's comments to reporters on Malkin 's injury , Kennedy 's status and Brent Johnson making the start against the Blue Jackets :
You do n’t have to worry about his courage on the ice and how he is going to play .
Knowing he has been dealing with this shoulder and he is still going out there throwing body checks and still going in there , that ’s the kind of players we have and that he is .
This is trying to make the best decision on the health of the player .
It is not an easy one .
It will be interesting .
We talk about the strength of our centermen .
People talk about Jordan Staal being a second centermen on another team .
We realize ( center ) is the strength of our team and we are fortunate to have depth at that position .
Jordan will certainly see more ice time and probably a little more power - play time as well .
I think we have enough quality forwards that we should be able to play a little bit differently , but we should be alright .
I ’ll take four - point games from him the next couple weeks that would be great .
Chris ’ game has been good – he has been effective , physical and there has been a little bite the past three or four games .
He gets results so we get to talk about him a little bit .
He is a guy who prides himself on doing the little things .
He has been doing them and he got rewarded last night .
It was just a maintenance day for Chris .
We do n’t have time for me to go over the concerns I think about daily .
So is it a concern ?
Certainly we have thought about it and are going to talk about different options .
When you lose two good players I think it goes without saying that you have some things to fill in and some concerns about who is going to go in there , how it ’s going to look and what the results are going to be .
At the same time , two of our last three goals have been by our second power play .
We have guys who can put the puck in the net .
Brent Johnson is going to go the game in Columbus and then we will move forward from there .
I think this team has been without Malkin , ( Sidney ) Crosby , ( Sergei ) Gonchar and ( Marc - Andre ) Fleury at different times .
It is another challenge and another opportunity .
You do n’t expect your 82 games to be perfect and you do n’t expect to go without an injury .
Adversity at different times of the year helps your team and your players grow .
Players grow into new ice - time assignments and different situations .
It is another chance for our team to be tested , have some adversity and have guys go get opportunities here .
You get to see guys step into those roles .
I think it will be good .
He is still day - to - day right now .
Bylsma announced after practice that goaltender Brent Johnson will make his first road start of the season Friday night in Columbus .
In his career Johnson has posted strong numbers against the Blue Jackets , registering a 9 - 2 - 2 record to go with a 2.07 goals - against average .
The nine wins are most for Johnson against any one team .
Lost amid the bombshell that Evgeni Malkin will be out a couple weeks was the update Bylsma provided on a couple other Penguins to miss practice Thursday .
Forward Tyler Kennedy remains day - to - day with an undisclosed injury .
He is not expected to play Friday night in Columbus .
Chris Kunitz , coming off a four - point night against Montreal on Wednesday , was given a maintenance day by Bylsma .
Head coach Dan Bylsma announced that forward Evgeni Malkin will miss 2 - 3 weeks with a shoulder strain .
It is not the same injury that kept Malkin out of the lineup during the beginning of the 2006 - 07 season and the team is being cautious .
" Geno is going to be out of the lineup for a couple of weeks , " Bylsma said .
" He strained his shoulder about 10 days or so ago .
I do n’t know the exact day .
It is precautionary for the player .
We are worried about the safety of the shoulder .
A couple weeks of rest and rehab will get that thing healthy so he can get back onto the ice .
Befitting a player who had played 254 consecutive regular - season games through Wednesday 's action , Malkin was naturally disappointed by the news .
" Obviously he has played with it and could gut it out , which is what Geno would be apt to do , " Bylsma said .
" At this time of the year the concern is the player and this is a precautionary measure .
" Although disappointed , Malkin will accompany the Penguins on their trip to Columbus later today .
" I can play good , but it ’s the early season , " Malkin said about the injury .
" I feel good .
It ’s not a big problem , and I ’m fine .
I ’ll be watching and supporting the team on the trip .
It ’ll be fine . "
" It ’s okay .
It ’s not the pain .
It feels good .
It ’s because it does n’t feel comfortable now .
"
Here are some of the sights from Thursday 's practice at Mellon Arena : Against the Blue Jackets the Penguins will be wearing their blue ' third jersey ' for the second time in ' 09 - 10 .
Pittsburgh defeated the Tampa Bay Lightning , 4 - 1 , the first time they wore the jerseys back on Oct. 17 .
The Penguins are wearing their blue gear in practice today to get a better feel for it in advance of tomorrow 's contest .
Friday will be the first time the Penguins have worn the blue jerseys on the road since a 2 - 1 shootout victory over the Buffalo Sabres on Jan , 1 , 2008 , which was the first time they had worn blue since defeating the Boston Bruins , 5 - 3 , on Jan. 27 , 1980 at the old Boston Garden .
Pittsburgh debuted their black - and - gold uniforms for the first time on Jan. 30 , 1980 in a 4 - 3 loss to the St. Louis Blues .
The Penguins have hit the ice this morning for practice before flying later to Columbus to take on the Blue Jackets Friday night at 7:00 p.m .
All were accounted for on the ice except Evgeni Malkin Tyler Kennedy and Chris Kunitz .
Check back later today for an update on their status .
What is there to reference counting that is not obvious ?
In any language that supports deterministic destruction and the overloading of the copy constructor and the assignment operator it should be trivial .
Or so I though until I decided to implement a simple ref-counted thread handle in D .
Two problems popped up :
How does reference counting interact with garbage collection ?
How to avoid data races in a multithreaded environment ?
In purely garbage - collected languages , like Java , you do n’t implement reference counting , period .
Which is pretty bad , if you ask me .
GC is great at managing memory , but not so good at managing other resources .
When a program runs out of memory , it forces a collection and reclaims unused memory .
When it runs out of , say , system thread handles , it does n’t reclaim unused handles–it just dies .
You ca n’t use GC to manage system handles .
So , as far as system resources go , Java forces the programmer to use the moral equivalent of C ’s malloc and free .
The programmer must free the resources explicitly .
In C++ you have std:: shared_ptr for all your reference - counting needs , but you do n’t have garbage collection for memory –at least not yet .
( There is also the Microsoft ’s C++/CLI which mixes the two systems . )
D offers the best of both worlds : GC and deterministic destruction .
So let ’s use GC to manage memory and reference counting ( or other policies , like uniqueness ) to manage other limited resources .
First attempt
The key to reference counting is to have a “ value ” type , like the shared_ptr in C++ , that can be cloned and passed between functions at will .
Internally this value type must have access to a shared chunk of memory that contains the reference count .
In shared_ptr this chunk is a separately allocated integral type –the counter .
The important thing is that all clones of the same resource share the same counter .
The counter ’s value reflects how many clones there are .
Copy constructors and assignment operators take care of keeping the count exact .
When the count goes to zero , that is the last copy of the resource goes out of scope , the resource is automatically freed ( for instance , by calling CloseHandle ) .
In my first attempt , I decided that the memory allocated for the counter should be garbage - collected .
After all , the important thing is to release the handle –the memory will take care of itself .
struct RcHandle { shared Counter _counter ; // GC 'd shared Counter object HANDLE _h ; ~ this ( ) { // destructor if ( _counter.dec ( ) == 0 ) // access the counter CloseHandle ( _h ) ; } // methods that keep the counter up to date }
RcHandle is a struct , which is a value type in D. Counter is a class , which is a reference type ; so _counter really hides a pointer to shared memory .
A few tests later I got a nasty surprise .
My program faulted while trying to access an already deallocated counter .
How did that happen ?
How could garbage collector deallocate my counter if I still had a reference to it ?
Here ’s what I did in my test : I embedded the ref-counted handle inside another garbage - collected object :
class Embedder { // GC 'd class object RcHandle _rc ; }
When the time came to collect that object ( which happened after the program ran to completion ) , its finalizer was called .
Whenever an object contains fields that have non-trivial destructors , the compiler generates a finalizer that calls the destructors of those embedded objects– _rc in this case .
The destructor of the ref-counted handle checks the reference count stored in the counter .
Unfortunately the counter did n’t exist anymore .
Hours of debugging later I had the answer .
What happened is that the garbage collector had two objects on its list : the embedder and the counter .
It just so happened that the collector decided to collect those two objects in reverse order : the counter first , then the embedding object .
So , by the time it got to the finalizer of the embedding object , the counter was gone !
What I discovered ( with the help of other members of the D team who were involved in the discussion ) was that there are some limitations on mixing garbage collection with deterministic destruction .
There is a general rule :
An object ’s destructor must not access any garbage - collected objects embedded in it .
Since the destructor of the ref-counted handle must have access to the counter , the counter must not be garbage - collectible .
That means only one thing : it has to be allocated using malloc and explicitly deallocated using free .
Which brings us to the second problem .
Concurrency
What can be simpler than an atomic reference count ?
On most processors you can atomically increment and decrement a memory location .
You can even decrement and test the value in one uninterruptible operation .
Problem solved !
Or is it ?
There is one tiny complication –the location that you are atomically modifying might disappear .
I know , this is totally counter - intuitive .
After all the management of the counter follows the simple rule : the last to leave the room turns off the light .
If the destructor of RcHandle sees the reference count going from one to zero , it knows that no other RcHandle has access it , and it can safely free the counter .
Who can argue with cold logic ?
Here ’s the troubling scenario : RcHandle is embedded in an object that is visible from two threads :
class Embedder { RcHandle _rcH ; } shared Embedder emb ;
Thread 1 tries to overwrite the handle :
RcHandle myHandle1 ; emb._rcH = myHandle1 ;
while Thread 2 tries to copy the same handle to a local variable :
RcHandle myHandle2 = emb._rcH ;
Consider the following interleaving :
T2 : Load the address of the _counter embedded in _rcH .
T1 : Swap emb._rcH with myHandle T1 : Decrement the counter that was embedded in _rcH .
If it ’s zero ( and it is , in this example ) , free the counter .
T2 : Increment the _counter .
Oops !
This memory location has just been freed .
The snag is that there is a window between T2 reading the pointer in ( 1 ) , and incrementing the location it ’s pointing to in ( 4 ) .
Within that window , the reference count does not match the actual number of clients having access to the pointer .
If T1 happens to do its ugly deed of freeing the counter within that window , the race may turn out deadly .
( This problem has been known for some time and there were various proposals to fix it , for instance using DCAS , as in this paper on Lock - Free Reference Counting . )
Should we worry ?
After all the C++ shared_ptr also exposes this race and nobody is crying havoc .
It turns out that it all boils down to the responsibilities of the shared object ( and I ’m grateful to Andrei for pointing it out ) .
A shared object should not willy - nilly expose its implementation to clients
If the clients of Embedder want access to the handle , they should call a synchronized method .
Here ’s the correct , race - free implementation of the Embedder in the scenario I just described .
class Embedder { private : RcHandle _rcH ; public : synchronized RcHandle GetHandle ( ) const { return _rcH ; } synchronized void SetHandle ( RcHandle h ) { _rcH = h ; } ... }
The method GetHandle copies _rcH and increments its count under the Embedder ‘s lock .
Another thread calling SetHandle has no chance of interleaving with that action , because it is forced to use the same lock .
D2 actually enforces this kind of protection for shared objects , so my original example would n’t even compile .
You might be thinking right now that all this is baloney because I ’m trying to fit a square peg into a round hole .
I ’m imposing value semantics on a non-atomic object , and you cannot atomically overwrite a non-atomic object .
However , using this logic , you could convince yourself that a double cannot have value semantics ( on most common architectures doubles are too large to be atomic ) .
And yet you can safely pass doubles between threads and assign them to each other ( which is the same as overwriting ) .
It ’s only when you embed a double inside a shared object , you have to protect it from concurrent access .
And it ’s not the double protecting itself –it ’s the shared embedder that is responsible for synchronization .
It ’s exactly the same with RcHandle .
Conclusions
Just when you thought you knew everything about reference counting you discover something you have n’t though about .
The take - home message is that mixing garbage collection with deterministic destruction is not a trivial matter , and that a race - free reference - counted object is vulnerable to races when embedded it in another shared object .
Something to keep in mind when programming in D or in C ++.
As a writer , an historian , an officer in the British army , an artist , a consummate statesman , and a man who understood the pleasures of a fine cigar and a handsome suit , Winston Churchill was one of the world ’s last true renaissance men .
High on the list of his many notable talents was his gift for moving and eloquent oratory .
His mastery of words gave him equal skill in rousing a nation to action and putting a brainless cad in his place .
Churchill once said :
“ It is a good thing for an uneducated man to read books of quotations .
Bartlett ’s Familiar Quotations is an admirable work , and I studied it intently .
The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts .
They also make you anxious to read the authors and look for more . ”
Of course , he himself became one of the most quotable men in history .
So much so , that it was an impossible task to narrow down his incredible quotes to just one post .
So we ’ve broken this edition of our motivational poster series into two parts .
Part II will be posted in the future .
For now , enjoy this first installment .
Whether you ’re educated or not , reading his quotes will light a fire under your bum and put a few more hairs on your chest .

Business Posters from the 1920s and 1930s
The job : Wang , 45 , is the founder and chief executive of Vizio Inc. , which has its headquarters in Irvine .
The consumer electronics manufacturer is known for bargain pricing and puts more LCD HDTVs on the market in the U.S. than any other company , according to iSuppli research .
Background :
He was born in Taiwan , and his parents moved to the U.S. when he was 12 to give him a better education .
Wang fell in love with U.S. television .
“ I learned English from television , ” he said .
“ ‘ Charlie ’s Angels , ’ ‘ Six Million Dollar Man ’ and ‘ The Bionic Woman . ’ ”
Ambition : Wang dreamed of becoming an architect , but he gave that up .
“ My mother did n’t think that architects make any money .
She recommended highly that I go into engineering . ”
He got a degree in electrical engineering from USC in 1986 and entered graduate school at Cal State Long Beach .

Day job : Wang worked for Tatung Co. , which made electronic equipment .
“ From 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m .
I worked in technical support , then went to school at night , ” he said .
The company offered him a promotion .
“ I had the opportunity to become sales manager and I took it . ”
That was the end of his graduate studies .
Computer monitors : Seeing the growing popularity of computers , Wang started a computer monitor manufacturing company in 1990 .
But after several profitable years , his company could n’t keep up with the downward spiral of prices .
Advertisement
“ We were not strong enough to survive the commoditization process of the industry , ” he said .
Turning point : On Oct. 31 , 2000 , after meeting with investors in Taiwan , Wang boarded Singapore Airlines Flight 006 to return to Los Angeles .
The pilot took the wrong runway , and just as the 747 was leaving the ground it slammed into construction equipment .
The crash and fire that followed killed 79 of 159 passengers and four crew members .
Wang , who was seated near the front , escaped injury .
“ I think when you face death , you realize that everyone ’s ending will be the same , ” Wang said .
“ I think I started to believe more in the life process , and enjoying the process . ”
Advertisement
Flat - panel TVs : In 2001 , he was a consultant with Gateway Inc. as that computer company started bringing wide - screen , flat - panel televisions to market .
But when Gateway shut down its retail stores , Wang saw his opportunity to get into the manufacture of the large - screen TVs , especially because the established brands were charging high prices for them .
“ Sony and Samsung had high margins , ” Wang said .
“ They still had the bulky CRT [ picture tube ] models to protect as their legacy brand .
They did n’t see the demand for low - cost flat - screens by everyday people .
That was a mistake . ”
In 2002 he started V Inc. to make TVs .
He later changed the company name to Vizio , which was a play on the word vision .
Advertisement
From the beginning , he undercut brand - name prices .
“ They were selling TVs for $ 8,000 , ” Wang said .
“ I was selling the same thing for $ 2,000 . ”
Cost control : Wang outsourced manufacturing and held to tight margins .
Even though the company says it has its TVs in 10 million households , Vizio has only 168 employees .
About half of them are in customer service .
“ From time to time there will be a problem with all electrical products , ” Wang said .
“ When it happens , we want to make sure the customer has the best service .
Advertisement
“ Once you get a customer to buy your product , you want to keep them forever .
The customer is king . ”
All of the Vizio call centers are in the U.S .
“ We have new product launches all the time , ” he said .
“ It ’s much easier to train customer service . . . when they are here . ”
TV design : Wang never became an architect , but his love of design has n’t waned .
He determines the look not only of Vizio TVs but also the remote controls .
Advertisement
“ It ’s fun for me , ” Wang said .
“ It ’s the funnest part of my job . ”

Craig Larman and Bas Vodde asked agile development experts working in and with large companies about the most challenging organizational impediments .
Find out what they said .

When we were writing the Organization chapter in Scaling Lean & Agile Development : Thinking and Organizational Tools for Large - scale Scrum we wanted to highlight some key issues .
Therefore , we asked a group of agile development experts working in and with large companies about the most challenging organizational impediments .
We aggregated their responses in the top ten organizational impediments .
The list is worth reflecting on and was included in the Organization chapter and in this short article .
10 . Jeff Sutherland , co-creator of Scrum , considers the failure to remove organizational impediments the main obstacle in large organizations .
A common reason for not removing impediments is “ That ’s the way we ’ve always done business . ”
We also frequently hear , “ We wo n’t change because we invested so much in this . ”
9. Peter Alfvin , an experienced development manager involved with introducing lean principles at Xerox , and Petri Haapio , head of the agile coaching department at Reaktor Innovations , both mention centralized departments looking for cost ‘ savings ’ and ‘ synergy ’ that leads to a local optimization as an impediment .
Their examples included a centralized tool department forcing one tool , leading to slower development caused by the wrong tool for a job ; furniture police forcing cubicles to standardize and minimize cost , leading to inefficient workplaces ; IT department limiting video conferencing to lower network traffic , leading to less communication .
8. Sami Lilja , global coordinator of agile development activities at Nokia Siemens Networks , noticed that some organizations consider learning a waste of time and money .
He believes this opinion is a major impediment because those organizations educate and coach people only “ when there is time for it . ”
This view results in a vicious fire fighting cycle — mistakes made because of constricted developer skills , hasty emergency repairs , management unwillingness to allot time to analyze earlier mistakes , more mistakes made ...
7. Larry Cai , a specialist at Ericsson Shanghai , mentions functional organizations ( single - function groups ) as one of the largest impediments .
They create barriers for communication and abet finger - pointing among units .
6. Esther Derby , consultant , coach , expert facilitator , and author of two books related to organizational learning , considers systems that foster local optimization over global optimization a major barrier .
She gave several examples , including Management by Objectives ( MBO ) and budgeting systems .
5. Mike Bria , a former agile coach at Siemens Medical Systems , mentioned “ do - it - yourself home improvement ” as an impediment .
He highlighted the problem attitude of “ we know how ” after people read one or two books .
In other words , the problem of failure to learn from outside expertise .
The same is mentioned by Lasse Koskela , the author of Test - Driven — unwillingness to look outside the organization .
4. A. ( name removed on request ) , a Scrum trainer at one of the largest e-commerce sites , mentioned individual performance evaluation and rewarding as a major obstacle .
They frustrate developers and managers , hinder team performance , and foster command - and - control management .
3. Lü Yi , a Scrum trainer and department manager of a large development group in Nokia Siemens Networks in Hangzhou , considers “ commitment games ” and unrealistic promises to be the main organizational obstacle .
They lead to shortcuts , continuous fire fighting , and legacy code .
We cover this topic in more detail in the Legacy Code chapter of the companion book , Practices for Scaling Lean & Agile Development .
2. Diana Larsen , expert facilitator and , together with Esther Derby , the author of Agile Retrospectives , simply stated , “ Assuming it ’s all about developers . ”
We have seen this frequently — people who do not think they need to change because agile and lean involves only developers .
They ask , “ Why would it affect me ? ”
1. Almost everybody cited “ silver bullet thinking and superficial adoption ” as a major impediment .
Dave Thomas , founder of OTI , large - scale lean product development consultant , and managing director of ObjectMentor , mentioned the misunderstanding of equating agility and productivity ( rather than for adaptability ) , and the lack of educated executives .
This leads to the belief that meaningful problems can be solved by saying “ we do agile ” and going through the motions , with no deep understanding or change by the leadership team — cargo cult process adoption .
Ironically , this leads to no real change and no real result , and the eventual predictable abandonment of lean principles or agile development because “ that does n’t work . ”
A related impediment is the wishful thinking that significant improvement in large product groups can and will happen “ fast , ” within only a few years , rather than what we see as the more likely five or ten years — if there is sustained executive support .
In addition , for this article , we asked each other to add one more favorite organizational impediment .
Craig thinks that a culture of individual workers rather than real teams and teamwork is a key impediment .
He visits many groups of individuals that are ostensibly adopting Scrum , and sees symptoms such as “ Jill does Jill ’s tasks , Raj does Raj ’s tasks ” and so forth , rather than a movement to “ whole team together , ” pair work , and multi-learning within the group .
Bas considers the gap between people in management roles and those doing the hands - on work to be a key impediment .
Frequently , changes made at the management level have no impact ( or at least , no positive impact ) whatsoever on the actual value work .
Similarly , decisions by hands - on developers are often not aligned with the direction of the organization .
This gap is caused by managers who do not Go and See at the real place of work — they often lost the skill to do so .
And by developers who do not think outside their normal job responsibilities — they are “ retired on the job . ”
It leads to shallow agile and lean adoptions that happen either only on the management level — without any change in technical practices — or only on the development level — without any change in the organization .
The lean practices of Go and See and managers - as - teachers help to reduce this gap .
The replies from the agile development experts validated our own experience and acknowledged that we were covering the right topics .
The remainder of the Organization chapter in the book explores these organizational obstacles and what you can do about them .

Abstract
Our software engineering team needed to create a system that moves data from a set of legacy applications with diverse properties to data repositories scattered around the network .
This system had to be highly concurrent , straightforward to extend , have high performance , and be coded rapidly by a small development staff .
Because of these requirements , the authors embarked upon an experiment to write this application in Erlang .
This paper describes what we did , why we did it , and what we learned over the course of our development effort .
It is our hope that this chronicle may be useful to others thinking about coding in Erlang for the first time and to the incumbent Erlang community to hear an outsider 's perspective on this fine language .
Introduction
In the fall of 1999 , a development team from Sendmail , Inc. began developing a program that would act as an I/ O request broker connecting a set of legacy applications to a set of distributed data repositories .
Some of these legacy applications might operate under a UNIX inetd - like forking model , some might be multithreaded using one thread per connection , and some might be multithreaded using thread pools and event - driven programming techniques .
The data passing through this program , which was creatively named the " Client Daemon " , is multiplexed over several separate connections to remote data repositories .
In essence , the Client Daemon acts as a " traffic cop " --- marshaling , massaging , and redirecting data and data requests from a varied set of legacy applications to a set of distributed servers .
( In fact , they may never complete .
The Client Daemon must handle network timeouts in a context - sensitive manner . )
There were a significant number of additional constraints placed on this project :
Rapid Development .
This technology introduced some fairly radical notions of data movement and storage .
The system needed to be demonstrated to work or to fail as soon as possible , to allow time for a redesign .

High performance .
A distributed architecture will have higher overhead than a well - tuned architecture based on a single machine .
Given that fundamental limitation , we want to make the overall system and each component as fast as possible .
The Client Daemon initiates few data requests itself .
The bulk of its work is taking data from one side ( from the network or another application ) , massaging it , and passing it through to the other side .
This means that its network interface and its IPC must be highly efficient .

Ease of Management .
There will be many nodes running a Client Daemon in a production environment .
Therefore , we need some mechanism to tie all these systems together for monitoring and administration .
Figure 1 represents the overall architecture .
The legacy applications are linked with a glue layer called the " Client Library " .
The Client Library uses IPC to move the data from these applications to the Client Daemon , and the Client Daemon moves the data over the network to remote Data Servers .
This paper describes the justification for and the procedures we went through to build the Client Daemon using Erlang .
We chronicle our experiences , including what went well and what did n't .
We provide some advice for other groups not terribly familiar with programming in Erlang and some suggestions for the Erlang community on how Erlang might be made more appealing to software development groups like ours .
Background
Since we and the company had developed many applications in C already , we had an intrinsic bias toward this language .
Early on , we built a rudimentary prototype in C using the Libero [ Libero ] and SMT [ SMT ] tools by iMatix and using the familiar rpcgen and libc 's ONC RPC library to handle the data transport over the network to the remote Data Servers .
The Libero / SMT finite - state machine approach seemed a viable way to manage the Client Daemon 's growth if we decided we liked SMT , and we would n't lose much time if we did n't like it .
C Prototype
We confirmed our suspicions that the ONC RPC stub generator , rpcgen , generates some really ugly code .
Furthermore , it assumes that all RPC calls are fully synchronous .
Even modern rpcgen implementations capable of generating thread - safe stubs assume the calls are synchronous .
As a result , we had to write our own RPC call mux / demux code , ignoring most of what rpcgen had created and bypassing much of the ONC RPC library 's infrastructure .
After just over a month of coding , the Libero / SMT version of the Client Daemon was capable of interacting with both the applications and the Data Servers , although it was by no means ready for production use .
At this point , we had learned a lot about RPC client stubs , RPC server stubs , XDR encoding , RPC fragment reassembly , and other RPC arcana , but the Client Daemon still had at least one obscure memory leak , its performance seemed slower than estimates predicted , and there were a great many core features that still needed to be implemented .
Erlang Discovered
Before starting the first prototype , we had conducted an exhaustive literature search to learn what lessons we could from the work of others .
During this time , we came across references to the HTTP load balancer Eddie [ Da ++98 ] which is written in Erlang .
Erlang 's built - in concurrency model was seductive : all the threading add - ons to C and C++ looked ugly by comparison .
The " standard " Erlang libraries and OTP helped keep us from typing too much .
Tony Rogvall gave us the source code to a full - featured ONC RPC library , allowing us to avoid a lot of XDR - and RPC - related drudge work .
( We have contributed our enhanced version of his package to the Erlang community .
It should be available at the erlang.org web site by the time of the conference . )
Also , around this time we had the opportunity to talk with a number of the software engineers at Bluetail A.B. who have written most of an email proxying system , called the Mail Robustifier [ Bluetail ] , in Erlang .
The fact that these folks had done significant work on an email - related project in Erlang increased our confidence in Erlang 's viability .
Their kindness to answer some general questions about coding such a project in Erlang helped us tremendously .
Two potential benefits of using Erlang were most appealing : higher programmer productivity and easier - to - maintain code .
It was difficult to tell how many of the success stories from Ericsson and other companies using Erlang were worthwhile praise and how many were hype .
Since our group was already familiar with a wide variety of arcane languages , we were quickly able to understand the reasons that these claims might be more than just smoke .
We felt that if Erlang could live up to its promises , many of the goals of the project could be met much more easily with Erlang than with C , especially given our time - to - market concerns .
Implementation in Erlang
It 's no surprise that software development managers are uncomfortable adopting new programming languages or techniques .
Trying new and radical techniques with the industry 's current time - to - market demands is usually a recipe for disaster .
Sendmail , Inc.'s management was as skeptical as one would expect .
Our dabbling with developing a second Client Daemon prototype in Erlang was greeted cautiously .
Outside of our team , nobody in our company had even heard of the language , much less knew anything about developing software in it .
The Second Prototype
The beginning of the learning curve was steep .
The simple matter of writing a non-trivial program in a functional language is a radical change for people used to working with procedural languages such as C or Perl .
We used parts of the OTP as best we understood them .
The result was not pretty , but it worked .
Once we got over the startup costs of coming to terms with the new language , the Erlang prototype fell together quickly .
After a month and a half , the Erlang Client Daemon had surpassed the Libero / SMT prototype in stability and feature set with comparable performance .
We did n't discover any project - killing issues , so we recommended to our management that we complete our development of the Client Daemon in Erlang .
Convincing Management To Let Us Continue
Our team had the advantage of being small and closely - knit .
The design and prototype development had been done in a " skunkworks " - like atmosphere : most of the company was preoccupied with other projects .
Given the size of our team , the promise of writing a complex application using a relatively small number of lines of code , and our time - to - market constraints , our team agreed that the potential benefits were worth risking our project on Erlang .
Our management was skeptical about using Erlang for production code .
First , they felt the discomfort normally associated with radical ideas .
Second , no other developers knew it , which makes it more difficult to solicit advice or conduct code reviews in - house .
Third , management felt that it might be hard to hire programmers for the team , since they would have to know both C and Erlang .
On the first and second points , we were still not entirely comfortable with the language ourselves , but both we and our management team were willing to set aside discomfort if the reasons for doing something new were compelling enough .
On the issue of hiring , we pointed out that we had come up to speed fairly quickly .
We felt that any programmer with an adventurous spirit could learn Erlang as quickly as we had ( especially with our mentoring ) and that our projections about time - to - market made this a worthwhile trade - off .
Further , they were persuaded by our estimates about how quickly we could code and debug this application in Erlang as opposed to C .
In the end , the rapid development schedule was able to compensate for the risk , since " If you 're going to fail , fail early [ Brooks95 ] . "
Further Development and Performance Tuning
We spent the next several months tightening up the code , improving Tony 's RPC library , filling out features in the Client Daemon , improving the Client Library , and fixing bugs .
While the core of the system was coming together , we had two outstanding concerns .
The first was that we found the overall structure of the code to be vaguely unsettling , and the Client Daemon still did n't perform as well as we'd like .
Prior to starting work on this project , we had established performance goals .
One of our really big concerns going into this project was that the Client Daemon would be doing a lot of data copying .
There would be significant performance penalties if it could not do so efficiently .
The default drivers in the Erlang emulator implement I / O via disk , pipes to spawned sub- processes , and TCP or UDP network connections .
The only way to have direct communication with an unrelated UNIX process is through TCP or UDP sockets , which are not as efficient as other IPC mechanisms .
We created some crude programs that simulated how the Client Daemon might perform if it could interact with the outside world using UNIX domain sockets , through an mmap ( ) - style DMA mechanism , and via other mechanisms .
We saw some potential for improvement there , but we still did n't know what was consuming all of our systems ' resources .
We used the Erlang profiler , eprof , to determine which processes were taking most of the CPU time .
Unfortunately , it was difficult to measure CPU time ( versus wall - clock time ) consumed or a global context for the answer .
We also had no insight as to how much time was spent in the runtime system for things like scheduling , memory management , linked - in drivers , and message - passing .
To answer these questions , we compiled the virtual machine with gprof support .
This gave us a global context for the performance data , but did n't give us any correlation with the Erlang code , only with the C code .
For instance , we knew how much of the resources were taken up by garbage collection , but we did not know which processes or modules were producing the most garbage .
Outside Assistance
At this point , we felt that we could accelerate our progress with some outside help .
Friends in the Erlang community recommended Lennart Öhman ( one of the authors of this paper ) , an experienced Erlang developer and trainer .
After being briefed on what we were doing and why , Lennart first set out to explain current best practice regarding process hierarchy , including supervisor structure principles and process linking techniques .
( " Imagine your application running for ten years .
How many uncontrolled processes are you willing to tolerate ? "
This was a perspective we desperately needed . )
Since the Client Daemon was not written using a strict top - down approach , but grew via more " organic " methods , we never looked at the entire process structure as a whole , and thus had a process hierarchy that was structured poorly .
In hindsight , much of his advice seemed like common sense , and we probably would have figured it out eventually , but we never stumbled across it in our perusal of the current documentation and our inspection of other Erlang applications .
Lennart 's presentation was much more efficient than discovering the principles ourselves by trial and error .
We also received a great deal of training on parts of the OTP that we had n't yet used .
We learned quite a number of best practices for Erlang coding that we had n't found documented anywhere or found only after we knew what to look for .
Overall , this contributed a great deal to the organization of our code , making it more flexible , structured , and readable , and generally enabled us to think more clearly about its architecture .
The performance issues proved to be more difficult .
We discussed several ideas on how to speed things up .
One idea was to run the legacy applications as an Erlang I/O port under the Client Daemon , allowing communication with that process using a pipe rather than an IP socket .
However , that technique wo n't work with those legacy applications that fork .
We considered adding an Erlang driver that would allow zero - copy I/ O of bulk data in and out of the virtual machine ( in most cases ) , but the time to implement such a modification to the system ran against our time - to - market constraints and has been shelved for future consideration .
It was brought to our attention that there have n't been many Erlang projects that are both I/O intensive and have had externally - driven performance goals .
Our application 's workload seems atypical in today 's Erlang usage , excepting Eddie and Bluetail 's products .
While it has been disappointing not to reach our a priori performance goals , detailed study suggests that our performance shortfall is probably related more to the UNIX process architecture and less to our language choice .
After performing code cleanup based on Lennart 's suggestions , we prepared for an initial test release of the system during the summer of 2000 .
That release has been put on hold while we perform integration work with another complex legacy application and improve our monitoring system .
Lessons Learned
Working with Erlang over the past year has been educational .
We 've learned a number of lessons that we think are worth sharing with the rest of the community .
Erlang is Quickly Learned
Even in isolation , a decent programmer can quickly come up to speed on the basics of Erlang , with greater ease than with many other more popular languages .
With mentoring , we expect that a new person could be able to understand enough of our existing code to begin making non-trivial contributions in less than a month .
OTP Is n't So Quickly Learned
Proficiency with the OTP , however , is another matter .
In our estimation , there simply is n't sufficient documentation to expect isolated programmers to make decent use of OTP on their own .
We often found ourselves making up too many things as we went along .
We 'd make informal bets that such - and - such a problem had already been solved but we did n't know how .
The erlang - questions mailing list [ Erl- list ] was invaluable --- as long as we had a coherent question to ask --- but it was hard to know what we might be missing .
If we 'd been learning Erlang at Ericsson the same way we learned C , rubbing shoulders with much more experienced programmers and tackling small , self - contained projects , we would have had a much easier experience .
Unfortunately , we had to immediately create the architecture for a major application .
Without a mentor , the best place for education is by reading existing code of well - written applications .
However , without commentary , we would expect the novice Erlang programmer to miss many subtle issues involved in employing it correctly .
We certainly did .
If mentoring is n't an option , we think a training course in the use of the OTP after the developers have some familiarity with the language is probably wise .
Erlang Is Good For Both Rapid Prototype and Production Code
Now that we 're more proficient with Erlang , prototyping new ideas is a rapid process .
Once the prototype is done , it can often be folded into production code with only small modifications .
The language , together with the standard and OTP libraries , provides an extremely useful framework .
We 're free to consider important operational issues from the beginning , knowing that many mundane details are already taken care of .
The process linking concept , together with process supervision trees , is the most valuable , in our experience .
The tools for event logging are a close runner - up .
And the inter - node message - passing infrastructure is so easy to use it's hard to explain to programmers not familiar with the language .
Erlang Performs Well
Our first experiences with bulk I/O with Erlang were bad , since the original version of the RPC code moved all data as lists of bytes rather than binaries .
Once we modified our code to be binary - friendly , we saw its performance increase by more than an order of magnitude .
Without binary data types , though , the language 's performance would have been abysmal for our application .
For a single application reading or writing a large file over the network , data throughput measures of the Erlang and C Client Daemons are identical : the performance of both is limited by network latency .
When performing multiple concurrent bulk reads or writes through the same Client Daemon , the C prototype is faster , but only by a couple of percentage points .
We were pleasantly surprised to find the difference so small .
We have found that our performance shortfall , relative to C , is due to a small penalty per byte of bulk data in each RPC transaction , and a large penalty per transaction .
We hope that the former can be addressed by a more advanced network driver or other IPC mechanisms , and that the latter can be addressed by further tuning our code .
We Would Use Erlang Again
Many advanced programming languages are useful for research but have severe deficiencies for production work .
Erlang does n't fit that pattern .
Our increased productivity with Erlang more than offset the difficulties of learning the language .
Aside from wanting access to UNIX domain sockets and shared memory , the language provided most of the tools we needed to develop the prototype and then expand it into a production - quality system .
Indeed , we had difficulties with the packaging and distribution tools largely because they provided more functionality than those in the traditional C/ UNIX environment .
We worried that the virtual machine might be too slow for our purposes .
Instead , performance has not been a big issue : Erlang 's performance is on par with our C prototype .
The next big performance increase will come from changing the communication channel between the Client Daemon and its applications , probably using shared memory .
If we were to use that scheme in both languages , we expect we would see comparable performance , and we expect the Erlang version would be finished sooner .
If we had to do this all over again , we 'd still use Erlang .
What Erlang Needs
We 've got a long wish list of things we'd like to see in future Erlang / OTP releases : enhancements to the virtual machine , new built - in functions , expanded libraries , more supported platforms , and better documentation .
Fortunately , under the Erlang Public License [ EPL ] , the source code is available for us to modify to suit our needs .
Many of these things are n't tremendously difficult to do ( As an example , we 've already experimented with having the TCP and UDP drivers allocate their buffers from a shared memory pool . ) , and we may yet implement some of them , but code is almost always nicer if someone else writes and maintains it .
We realize many of these wishes may be fulfilled by the R7 release of Erlang / OTP .
However , since we do not have that release at the time this document is being written , these wishes are based on the R6B release .
Better Documentation of Best Coding Practices
The Erlang book is the best reference we 've found for learning the language .
However , documentation on the Open Telecom Platform is confined to the reference material in the online documentation [ Erlang ] .
In fairness to the current OTP documentation , it is a good reference resource , but it 's not a tutorial .
You simply need to know where to look and to know if it's the right hammer to pound any particular nail .
Programmers coming from a C / UNIX background are accustomed to an edit - compile - debug work cycle inherited from batch - processing origins .
Interactive editors and integrated development environments have accelerated the cycle but have not changed its fundamental character .
The interactive interpreter was therefore a little puzzling --- how should it be used in daily work ?
Being unable to learn at the knees of local experienced Erlang programmers , we experimented on our own .
Having a detailed " user story " in the documentation , a low - level chronicle of a typical day programming Erlang , would have accelerated this process .
More , Better , and Faster IPC Mechanisms
Understanding that our desires are biased toward the applications we typically work on , we 'd like to see UNIX domain sockets formally supported .
We 'd also love to dabble with shared memory , though it can be problematic in a system where memory management is hidden from the programmer .
We 'd love to see a more efficient TCP and UDP driver , one that makes use of the outputv ( ) driver interface to allow use of vectored I/O primitives and other efficiency mechanisms .
We understand the portability concerns raised by supporting these admittedly platform - specific features .
It can make " write once , run anywhere " code more difficult to write and maintain .
( The Client Daemon runs quite well on Erlang / OTP for Windows NT , despite intentionally ignoring NT during development . )
Such feature creep presents a slippery slope : what new features are platform - independent enough , or is customer demand great enough ?
In our opinion , the need for fast IPC warrants their use in the standard Erlang distribution .
As discussed in the section titled We Would Use Erlang Again , Erlang is a surprisingly useful , practical language .
Support for additional IPC mechanisms can only encourage other adventurous programmers to develop other Erlang applications that break yet more new ground .
Better Debugger
The debugger in Erlang / OTP R6 is useful , but it needs enhancements .
We would love to see a binding watchpoint feature added .
A more streamlined " compile , debug , edit , compile , debug newly - edited code in the same debugger environment " cycle , one that requires fewer mouse clicks , would be nice .
Also , it would be handy to save breakpoint settings in a context - sensitive manner , attempting to maintain breakpoint locations despite adding or deleting lines of code prior to the breakpoint .
Better Profiling Tools
We 've spent a good deal of effort trying to understand the performance characteristics of the BEAM VM in general and of our application running within it .
The Erlang / OTP R6 profiling tool , eprof , is okay at best and utterly inaccurate at worst .
We ended up working on a better tool , ( We were desperate enough to modify eprof for greater accuracy and to try to measure both wall - clock and CPU time .
See http://www.erlang.org/ml-archive/erlang-questions/200005/msg00052.html.) but the effort has been limited by the VM 's process trace output itself : it can fail to mention execution of some short functions , which throws off function call counts and can lead to misattribution of execution time .
The fundamental problem is the lack of a global context for the profiling results .
If eprof profiling reveals a function to be the tall tent pole within a given process , it may still be insignificant if the profiled process is only a small fraction of the overall runtime .
The user - contributed top tool [ Top ] is useful for getting a system - wide view of VM reductions , but it cannot account for reductions made by short - lived processes .
Furthermore , there is no accurate correlation between VM reductions and either CPU or wall - clock time .
To give a global context for our performance , we used gprof to measure the BEAM VM as a C program .
This did n't allow us to directly measure the execution of our program code , but we were able to see the relative weights of bytecode execution , message - passing , garbage collection , and linked - in drivers .
Within the Erlang code , we see the need for both process - oriented and function - oriented profiling .
We also need the ability to create a gprof - style call graph .
Lastly , we need both wall - clock and CPU - clock timing statistics .
Better String Handling
Being avid Perl hackers , it may be unfair to criticize Erlang for weak string handling features , but we 'll do it anyway .
The functions found in the standard string module are a good base .
But Erlang 's treatment of strings as lists of bytes is as elegant as it is impractical .
The factor - of - eight storage expansion of text , as well as the copying that occurs during message - passing , cripples Erlang for all but the most performance - insensitive text - processing applications .
Erlang 's treatment of binaries , by contrast , has so far proven to be a showcase for the language 's features without a significant cost in performance .
We 'd much rather see a string library , parser - generator , etc. , based on binaries , or on some new binary - like string representation , rather than the current list representation .
Multiprocessing Support and Memory Usage
Again , on this topic Erlang is caught between a rock and a hard place .
On multiprocessing machines , we 'd really like to see the virtual machine take advantage of as many CPUs as are available , especially since moving data between Erlang instantiations via IPC currently requires several data copies and is therefore expensive .
We see no reason why SMP support would require any change to the language or its libraries .
It would require a massive redesign of the virtual machine and possibly large sections of platform - specific code to get the best performance .
However , if Erlang wants to be considered for applications like ours on high - end hardware , SMP support is necessity .
We understand that with R7 we 'll see the VM able to use up to 4 GBytes of RAM , but , again , for high end applications this is n't enough .
We need to be able to run our system on 12 + processor machines with 12 + GBytes of RAM .
For the foreseeable future , this means running multiple virtual machines per physical server , which is something we 'd prefer not to do .
More Support For Writing Network Servers
Many important Internet applications , such as the Apache web server and the BIND naming daemon , are moving toward a multithreaded programming model .
We shudder to think of using C/ pthreads to achieve this .
With the imminent release of the bit syntax , we see a great opportunity for Erlang to be the premiere language for serious Internet server development .
We 'd like to see more support for writing servers providing TCP - and UDP - based protocols .
While there are a few sample applications to learn from , more could be done to assist programmers communicating via an IP network to non-Erlang - based clients .
Items on this wish list include :
More documentation and examples of non-trivial clients and servers of popular protocols .
Allow a listening TCP socket to operate in an " active " mode , i.e. by allowing gen_tcp : accept ( ) to send a message to the listening process rather than as a blocking function call .
( Some thought should be given to a rate - limiting mechanism for these automatic accepts , although much existing connection accepting code has no such mechanism , either . )
This would allow a gen_server to directly accept new connections without blocking .
to send a message to the listening process rather than as a blocking function call .
( Some thought should be given to a rate - limiting mechanism for these automatic accepts , although much existing connection accepting code has no such mechanism , either . )
This would allow a to directly accept new connections without blocking .
Streamline / simplify the process for passing ownership of a newly - accepted socket descriptor process to another process .
The most natural way to write a per-session process 's start ( ) entry point is to have the TCP connection socket as an argument and to give the new process 's PID as a return value .
However , there is a race between the new process using the socket ( e.g. printing a prompt or greeting ) and the listener process changing the socket ownership .
This race can be resolved with some message - passing for synchronization , but it has occurred often enough in our code to be annoying .

Avoid needless data copies across the driver boundary .
The binary syntax will help immensely with network byte - order conversions and ( un ) packing encoded data structures .
With a few clean - ups and an eye towards attracting a wider audience , we feel that Erlang can make significant strides as a network application language .
Conclusion
We were surprised at the extent to which Erlang fulfilled its promises .
It took some effort , but it was straightforward for developers to come up to speed on the language , and its use significantly reduced the time it took to produce working code .
While we still believe that Erlang has some deficiencies , it has demonstrated itself as a first class prototyping language , and we have no qualms about shipping a production application based upon it .
A number of Erlang 's features are novel and compelling .
As we look at other projects written in C , we often find ourselves thinking about solving their problems with Erlang .
While there are a great number of places in which the language and its environment could be significantly improved , Erlang is already a fascinating language that deserves a wider audience than it currently has .
