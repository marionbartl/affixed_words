Scientist Turns Mice Cells Into Bone Instead of Fat
Clinton T. Rubin knows full well that his recent results are surprising — that no one has been more taken aback than he .
And he cautions that it is far too soon to leap to conclusions about humans .
But still , he says , what if ?
And no wonder , other scientists say .
Rubin , director of the Center for Biotechnology at the State University of New York at Stony Brook , is reporting that in mice , a simple treatment that does not involve drugs appears to be directing cells to turn into bone instead of fat .
All he does is put mice on a platform that buzzes at such a low frequency that some people cannot even feel it .
The mice stand there for 15 minutes a day , five days a week .
Afterward , they have 27 percent less fat than mice that did not stand on the platform — and correspondingly more bone .
“ I was the biggest skeptic in the world , ” Rubin said .
“ And I sit here and say , ‘ This ca n’t possibly be happening . ’
I feel like the credibility of my scientific career is sitting on a razor ’s edge between ‘ Wow , this is really cool , ’ and ‘ These people are nuts . ’ ”
The responses to his work bear out that feeling .
While some scientists are enthusiastic , others are skeptical .
The mice may be less fat after standing on the platform , these researchers say , but they are not convinced of the explanation — that fat precursor cells are turning into bone .
The story of the finding , which was published online and will appear in the Nov. 6 issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , began in 1981 when Rubin and his colleagues started asking why bone is lost in aging and inactivity .
“ Bone is notorious for ‘ use it or lose it , ’ ” Rubin said .
“ Astronauts lose 2 percent of their bone a month .
People lose 2 percent a decade after age 35 .
Then you look at the other side of the equation .
Professional tennis players have 35 percent more bone in their playing arm .
What is it about mechanical signals that makes Roger Federer ’s arm so big ? ”
At first , he assumed that the exercise effect came from a forceful impact — the pounding on the leg bones as a runner ’s feet hit the ground or the blow to the bones in a tennis player ’s arm with every strike of the ball .
But Rubin was trained as a biomechanical engineer , and that led him to consider other possibilities .
Large signals can actually be counterproductive , he said , adding : “ If I scream at you over the phone , you do n’t hear me better .
If I shine a bright light in your eyes , you do n’t see better . ”
Over the years , he and his colleagues discovered that high - magnitude signals , like the ones created by the impact as foot hits pavement , were not the predominant signals affecting bone .
Instead , bone responded to signals that were high in frequency but low in magnitude , more like a buzzing than a pounding .
That makes sense , he went on , because muscles quiver when they contract , and that quivering is the predominant signal to bones .
It occurs when people stand still , for example , and their muscles contract to keep them upright .
As people age , they lose many of those postural muscles , making them less able to balance , more apt to fall and , perhaps , prone to loss of bone .
“ Bone is bombarded with little , teeny signals from muscle contractions , ” Rubin said .
He discovered that in mice , sheep and turkeys , at least , standing on a flat vibrating plate led to bone growth .
Small studies in humans — children with cerebral palsy who could not move much on their own and young women with low bone density — indicated that the vibrations might build bone in people , too .
Rubin and his colleagues got a patent and formed a company to make the vibrating plates .
But they and others caution that it is not known if standing on them strengthens bones in humans .
Even if it does , no one knows the right dose .
It is possible that even if there is an effect , people might overdose and make their bones worse instead of better .
Some answers may come from the federal clinical trial , which will include 200 elderly people in assisted living .
It is being directed by Dr. Douglas P. Kiel , an osteoporosis researcher and director of medical research at the Institute for Aging Research at Harvard .
The animal work made him hopeful that the buzzing platforms would have an effect on human bones .
“ This work is fascinating and very legitimate , ” Kiel said .
But then Rubin reported that the mice were also less fat , which led to the revised plans to look for changes in body fat as well .
Rubin says he decided to look at whether vibrations affect fat because he knows what happens with age : Bone marrow fills with fat .
In osteoporosis , the bones do not merely thin ; their texture becomes lacy , and inside the holes is fat .
And a few years ago , scientists discovered a stem cell in bone marrow that can turn into either fat or bone , depending on what signal it receives .
No one knows why the fat is in bone marrow — maybe it provides energy for failing bone cells , suggests Dr. Clifford J. Rosen , director of the Maine Center for Osteoporosis Research and Education .
And no one knows whether human fat cells ever leave the bone marrow and take up residence elsewhere .
“ It is a very intriguing paper , ” said Claude Bouchard , an obesity researcher who is director of the Pennington Center for Biomedical Research at Louisiana State University .
But he wondered whether the mice on the platform were simply burning more calories .
“ It seems to me , ” Bouchard said , “ that putting myself in the body of a mouse , if I was on a platform that was vibrating 90 times a minute , I would try to adhere to the surface and not be thrown off .
I would probably tense my legs a little bit .
That is energy expenditure . ”
Stress may be another factor , he added .
Standing on the platform may have frightened the mice , and they might have become sick .
Dr. Rudolph L. Leibel , an obesity researcher who is co-director of the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center at Columbia University , had similar questions .
A platform that seems to be barely vibrating to a human could feel like an earthquake to a mouse , Leibel said , adding , “ they could be scared to death , ” which could affect the study data .
He also questioned the idea that precursor cells from bone marrow could turn into fat cells in the rest of the body , calling it “ a contested and , I would say , incorrect notion . ”
If the mice that stood on the platform became thinner and if they ate as much as mice that did not stand on the platform ( as Rubin reported ) , they must be burning more calories , Leibel said .
Others are more hopeful .
“ This is very , very cool , ” said Dr. John B. Buse , a diabetes researcher at the University of North Carolina who is president for science and medicine at the American Diabetes Association .
If it turned out to hold for people too , “ it would be great for diabetes , ” he added .
He noted that people with Type 2 diabetes were likely not only to be overweight but also to have problems with their bones .
Still , Buse awaits more definitive studies in humans .
“ It is almost too good to be true , ” he said .
The search for life elsewhere in the solar system and beyond should include efforts to detect what scientists sometimes refer to as " weird " life -- that is , life with an alternative biochemistry to that of life on Earth -- says a new report from the National Research Council .
The committee that wrote the report found that the fundamental requirements for life as we generally know it -- a liquid water biosolvent , carbon - based metabolism , molecular system capable of evolution , and the ability to exchange energy with the environment -- are not the only ways to support phenomena recognized as life .
" Our investigation made clear that life is possible in forms different than those on Earth , " said committee chair John Baross , professor of oceanography at the University of Washington , Seattle .
The report emphasizes that " no discovery that we can make in our exploration of the solar system would have greater impact on our view of our position in the cosmos , or be more inspiring , than the discovery of an alien life form , even a primitive one .
At the same time , it is clear that nothing would be more tragic in the American exploration of space than to encounter alien life without recognizing it . "
The tacit assumption that alien life would utilize the same biochemical architecture as life on Earth does means that scientists have artificially limited the scope of their thinking as to where extraterrestrial life might be found , the report says .
The assumption that life requires water , for example , has limited thinking about likely habitats on Mars to those places where liquid water is thought to be present or have once flowed , such as the deep subsurface .
However , according to the committee , liquids such as ammonia or formamide could also work as biosolvents -- liquids that dissolve substances within an organism -- albeit through a different biochemistry .
The recent evidence that liquid water - ammonia mixtures may exist in the interior of Saturn 's moon Titan suggests that increased priority be given to a follow - on mission to probe Titan , a locale the committee considers the solar system 's most likely home for weird life .
" It is critical to know what to look for in the search for life in the solar system , " said Baross .
" The search so far has focused on Earth - like life because that 's all we know , but life that may have originated elsewhere could be unrecognizable compared with life here .
Advances throughout the last decade in biology and biochemistry show that the basic requirements for life might not be as concrete as we thought . "
Besides the possibility of alternative biosolvents , studies show that variations on some of the other basic tenets for life also might be able to support weird life .
DNA on Earth works through the pairing of four chemical compounds called nucleotides , but experiments in synthetic biology have created structures with six or more nucleotides that can also encode genetic information and , potentially , support Darwinian evolution .
Additionally , studies in chemistry show that an organism could utilize energy from alternative sources , such as through a reaction of sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid , meaning that such an organism could have an entirely non-carbon - based metabolism .
Researchers need to further explore variations of the requirements for life with particular emphasis on origin - of - life studies , which will help determine if life can exist without water or in environments where water is only present under extreme conditions , the report says .
Most planets and moons in this solar system fall into one of these categories .
Research should also focus on how organisms break down key elements , as even non-carbon - based life would need elements for energy , structure , and chemical reactions .
The report also stresses that the future search for alien life should not exclude additional research into terrestrial life .
Through examination of extreme environments , such as deserts and deep under the oceans , studies have determined that life exists essentially anywhere water and a source of energy are found together on Earth .
Field researchers should therefore seek out organisms with novel biochemistries and those that exist in areas where vital resources are scarce to better understand how life on Earth truly operates , the committee said .
This improved understanding will contribute greatly toward seeking Earth - like life where the conditions necessary for its existence might be met , as in the case of subsurface Mars .
Space missions will need adjustment to increase the breadth of their search for life .
Planned Mars missions , for example , should include instruments that detect components of light elements -- especially carbon , hydrogen , oxygen , phosphorus , and sulfur -- as well as simple organic functional groups and organic carbon .
Recent evidence indicates that another moon of Saturn , Enceladus , has active water geysers , raising the prospect that habitable environments may exist there and greatly increasing the priority of additional studies of this body .

While national polls place him near the bottom of the field , impressive fundraising , Internet buzz and crowds of spirited followers have Rep.
Ron Paul , R - Texas , in unfamiliar territory .
As his campaign gains traction , Paul faces a philosophical contradiction :
Is he the principled agent provocateur , known as " Dr. No " on Capitol Hill , trying to bring about a grass - roots anti-big - government uprising in American politics ?
Or is Paul a Republican presidential candidate with a libertarian bent , seeking big money contributions to fund a traditional campaign ?
More important for Paul , can he be both ?
Traditional Campaign or Grass - Roots Movement ?
Last weekend Paul , the grass - roots libertarian , found himself in a swank New York City penthouse apartment -- complete with a view of the Empire State building -- talking to supporters enjoying hors d'oeuvres at a $ 1,000 - per- person fundraiser .
The campaign had raised $ 50,000 before Paul left to spend the rest of the weekend at a conference for the libertarian von Mises Institute , which celebrates Paul 's intellectual forefather , Austrian philosopher and economist Ludwig von Mises .
Von Mises might have raised his eyebrows at Paul 's candidacy as a Republican .
" Full government control of all activities of the individual is virtually the goal of both national parties , " the Libertarian thinker wrote in his book " America " .
It is not just well - heeled fundraisers and intellectual conferences that have allowed Paul to blossom -- in fact his grassroots campaign may be in spite of them .
Nearly 70 percent of the more than $ 5 million Paul raised in the past three months came from the Internet , according to Paul 's fundraising director , Jonathan Bydlak .
That haul put Paul a surprising fourth in Republican fundraising , matching , for the second time this year , the total of Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz. , once thought to be a formidable front - runner for the nomination by many political pundits .
And Bydlak himself proves the point about the young , anti-establishment , insurgent style of Paul 's campaign .
A 24 year - old who worked for a hedge fund after graduating from Princeton , Bydlak quit and joined with Paul in August -- meaning , of course , that Paul has only had a fundraising director since that time .
In interviews , Paul stresses that his campaign is more vox populi than traditional American politics .
" The organization of the campaign popped up spontaneously on the Internet with these meet - up groups , " Paul said in a recent interview with ABC News .
" It 's natural that they would donate the money .
So in many ways the campaign has found me as much as I have found them .
It 's not a top - down organization .
Its sort of bottom up .
All we have done at the campaign is provide the message and the message turns out to be popular . "
Politics of an Insurgent
But even an insurgent candidate like Paul , if he wants to come off the fringe of the Republican backbench and make a viable run for his party 's nomination , will need more than $ 5 million to hire a large enough national infrastructure and buy expensive media ad time .
So along with the online viral solicitations , Paul has learned to raise funds the old - fashioned way too .
In recent months he has attended fundraisers in Florida , outside Boston , New York and elsewhere .
At another $ 1,000 minimum fundraiser in August , Paul raised $ 104,000 at real estate developer Donald Huffines ' house in Highland Park , Texas , outside Dallas .
Huffines , a self - described conservative Republican , said he supported George W. Bush in 2000 and " generally supports whoever the party nominates " in the general election .
But Huffines sees something special in Ron Paul .
" There is no passion with the other candidates , and there is zero excitement for the other candidates at the local level , where I am , " said Huffines , who has been active at the precinct level in past years .
Contrast Huffines with the stereotypical Paul supporter -- young , perhaps bearded male , who seems likely to attend a rally on a college campus .
But everyone is welcome in Ron Paul 's tent .
Passionate Paul Supporters Defy Central Casting
One Ron Paul supporter , Liv , a 24 year - old bubbly blond vegetarian from Los Angeles who posts videos to her Myspace page and calls herself " Ron Paul Girl , " has one of the more viewed Ron Paul videos on YouTube .
In it , she strips down to her underwear and a tank top which reads " Ron Paul 2008 . "
In another video , Liv is seated on a couch and tries to woo Paul supporters into the Republican Party .
" Look , unless she drives off a bridge and drowns a girl , Hillary Clinton has got the Democratic nomination .
But with the Republican nomination still up for grabs , there remains a chance , a chance , that in 2008 we can get a candidate through who does n't completely suck , Liv said , before then imploring her viewers to register Republican and vote in the primaries .
" I know how some of you feel about the Republican Party , " she acknowledges .
" Do they sometimes start wars for seemingly no reason ?
Yes .
Do they sometimes try to cram their own personal religious beliefs down everyone 's throats ?
Sure , some of them do . "
" You do n't have to commit to being a Republican for the rest of your life , " Liv entices .
" Just for this primary election .
And after the primary election you can .
… change your registration back to Democrat or tree - hugging Green Party member or whatever it is that you normally are . "
There is an obvious divide between traditional Republicans and the Ron Paul Revolution , as it's called by supporters , is not , as Huffines puts it , " the country club Republican set . "
Politics of Paul
In radio ads , Paul has stressed his Republican credentials - for small government , against socialized healthcare , and pro-life .
He does not , in the ads running in early primary states and intended to introduce him to traditional Republicans there , mention his opposition to the Iraq War , even though that issue more than any other has made him the darling of supporters like " Liv " on the Internet .
Another thing the Ron Paul revolutionaries must come to terms with is that Paul , while he opposes spending bills and taxes , is still a successful congressman , serving off and on since the 1970s .
While he crusades against wasteful spending , Paul also does what most politicians in Washington do -- represent his constituents by earmarking funds for them in appropriations bills .
It is no revelation that Paul does , as his campaign said , " forward " funding requests from constituents to appropriators in Congress .
Earmarks , placed secretly into spending bills have been made into the good government bogeyman by watchdogs in recent years .
" Eliminating earmarks designated by members of Congress would simply transfer the funding decision process to federal bureaucrats rather then elected representatives , " Paul said on the House floor in June .
" In an already flawed system , earmarks can at least allow residents of congressional districts to have a greater role in allocating federal funds -- their tax dollars -- than if the money is allocated behind locked doors by bureaucrats .
So we can be critical of the abuses in the current system , but we should n't lose sight of how some reforms may not actually make the system much better . "
Offsetting earmark requests by voting against appropriations bills is not an entirely convincing argument for government watchdogs .
" The idea that the only way you can get re-elected is to bribe your way in is a myth , " said Leslie Paige of the nonpartisan Citizens Against Government Waste .
" That is the rationale they can use to say everyone else is getting a piece of the pie .
It 's passing the buck . "
Paul does get a high marks from Paige 's group for his voting record against pork - laden spending bills .
Ultimately , Paul 's campaign , more than any other in the presidential field , has less to do with Paul than with Paul 's message against the way Washington works .
It remains to be seen if enough traditional Republicans will join the cause , allowing Paul to make an impact at the polls .
But Paul's " revolutionaries " -- traditional or not -- are convinced .
" Ron 's niche is huge , " said Huffines .
" His niche you could drive a semi through .
Where the current party is , and the mainstream talking heads in the party , is not where the people are . "
Joe O’Donnell ’s glowing legacy outlived him by less than a week .
The man recalled by some as “ The Presidential Photographer ” with a knack for having a camera to his eye at just the right moment , became instead someone described as a fraud who hijacked some of the 20th century ’s most famous images and claimed them as his own .
Mr. O’Donnell , a retired government photographer , died on Aug. 9 in Nashville at age 85 .
Obituaries published nationwide , including one in The New York Times on Aug. 14 , praised his body of work over several presidential administrations , most of them singling out one famous picture : little John F. Kennedy Jr. saluting his slain father ’s passing coffin on Nov. 25 , 1963 .
That picture was later determined to have been taken by someone else , and a closer examination of photos that Mr. O’Donnell claimed as his own has turned up other pictures taken by other photographers .
Retired news photographers all over the country , some into their 80s , reacted at the claims in the obituaries with shock and outrage as the only rights most of them have to their own pictures — bragging rights — were quietly taken by a man they never heard of .
“ The more I hear about this , the more upset I get , ” said Cecil Stoughton , 87 , a former White House photographer .
“ I do n’t know where he ’s coming from .
Delusions of grandeur . ”

Everyone loves to blog : CEOs , Web geeks , fashionistas , and even gardening grandmas .
Blogging provides an outlet for those wanting to promote their businesses , publicize their political , social , or professional analyses , or to just meet other people like themselves who share similar interests and lifestyles .
But what good is your blog if no one wants to read it ?
To help attract more readers to your blog , we ’ve generated a list of 36 tips and resources for you to implement in order to ensure maximum usability .
If your blog is easy and fun to visit , you ’ll notice more readers flocking to your site .
Links and Web Addresses
Make sure your links are easy to follow , and ensure that they always connect visitors with the appropriate pages .
Navigation Bar : Both new and old visitors to your blog are looking for a quick way to search your site , whether they want to get a feel for what you ’re all about or they ’re looking for a particular post to share with friends .
Create a simple , easy - to - find navigation bar in an obvious location ( across the top is usually the best ) that links to your author page , contact information , archives , and other pages .
Link to old posts :
Always link to past blogs in your content , and under posts .
You can also group old posts into categories like “ most read ” or “ most commented on ” , instead of by date .
This helps readers find related content , and the internal links may boost SEO .
Link your logo to your homepage : Community Spark ’s number one tip for blog usability is to “ ensure your logo links to your homepage . ”
If you do n’t include a “ Home ” button in your navigation bar , link your blog ’s logo or title to your homepage .
This simple trick will let readers start over if they get too embedded in your archives .
Set up your own domain name : Blog guru Jakob Nielsen encourages bloggers to set up their own domain name rather than keeping a WordPress or Blogger style address .
Instead of being subjected to unwanted software changes or pricing increases , go independent .
Check out these top 10 providers for Web hosting , all priced at $ 7.95 and under .
You can use Windows or Linux hosting , regardless of the operating system on your computer , but make sure that your chosen plan supports the blogging software you want to use .
Allow visitors to search your site : Instead of making your visitors click through endless archives and categories lists to find what they ’re looking for , set up a Google Custom Search Engine to provide a straightforward search .
Let readers decide how to open links :
In order to keep your readers happy , let them decide whether or not they want to open the links in a new tab or window .
This article on Problogger . net discusses the reasons why opening in the same window is usually best .
Test your links before publishing a post :
Before publishing your new posts , always test your links to make sure you entered them correctly .
You may have left out a letter or symbol during your copy / paste method or remembered a Web address incorrectly .
Spare your readers the irritation of trying to connect to a page that wo n’t open .
Match your blog ’s title to the web address :
Being consistent with your blog title is in your best interest as well as that of your readers .
If your Web address is different from your blog ’s actual title , readers might be confused as to what your site should be called .
Searching for your blog via Google will also be problematic if your site is commonly referred to and searched for by two different names .
Clearly describe where each link directs readers : Skelliewag strongly encourages bloggers to recognize that “ It ’s important that the text leading up to the link explains where the click here will lead , ” .
Use descriptive words for the anchor text , rather than generic terms .
This may also offer an SEO advantage for the destination .
Make it easy for readers to share your content : Sites like Digg , Delicious and StumbleUpon let readers rank their favorite blogs and articles .
Make it easy for them to rank you by including links to these sites at the end of each post .
Author Information
Show your readers that you ’re involved with your blog beyond your regular posts .
Encourage them to contact you through e-mail or comments , and do n’t be shy about providing an author biography to give yourself and your opinions a little more legitimacy .
Create an “ About ” page : Creating an “ About ” page will direct readers to your contact information , biography , credentials , and overall theme for your blog .
Organizing this information on a single page will keep you accountable to your readers and allow your other pages to focus on your actual posts .
Provide contact information :
Many bloggers are shy about revealing their contact information to anyone who stumbles across their site .
Not providing a means of contact , though , translates to readers as being unfriendly and detached .
If you ’re worried about stalkers flooding your inbox with hate mail , create a separate account just for your blog .
That way , you can keep your personal account private .
Respond to comments : Encourage readers to comment on your articles by providing a comment box at the end of each post .
Respond to their comments through email or in your own comment box to further the discussion and show visitors that you value their opinions and support .
Develop a short autobiography : Jakob Nielsen , as well as many other bloggers and readers , rant about authors who do n’t provide adequate biographies .
Let your readers know what you ’re interested in , what educational background you have , and what professional industry you ’re a part of .
You do n’t have to get too specific if you ’re afraid of revealing your company name or alma mater , but shedding a little light on your specialties or credentials will make your readers more apt to follow your advice and respect your opinions .
Design and Content
You do n’t have to hire a Web developer to implement these basic design and content principles .
The following tips and tricks will keep your blog looking polished and professional , even if you did it all yourself .
Pick a design theme :
Pick a theme for your blog ’s design , and be consistent .
Every page should follow the same color scheme , layout , and image theme .
Being too adventurous with your designs will only confuse and distract your readers .
If you want to avoid having the same theme as another blogger , consider paying for a premium theme .
Choose an editorial theme and stick to it : Just as you need to remain consistent with your design theme , you also need to choose an editorial theme that you plan to stick to .
Jakob Nielsen advises that “ If you publish on many different topics , you ’re less likely to attract a loyal audience of high - value users .
Busy people might visit a blog to read an entry about a topic that interests them .
They ’re unlikely to return , however , if their target topic appears only sporadically among a massive range of postings on other topics . ”
If you ’re desperate to write on unrelated topics , consider starting a second blog .
Replace text with images :
Add images and photos to break up the page .
The best general rule for adding images is to use them alongside the title or subtitles .
Include a photo or picture of something that directly relates to the post .
Images are critical for social sharing , particularly on Facebook , where posts with images get much more attention .
Avoid animation : Animated gifs and Flash are definitely out of vogue .
Unless you have a reason to animate , try to avoid it .
Link to an informative video instead .
Do n’t let advertisements dominate your blog : SiteProNews warns bloggers against “ excessive advertising , ” which can be “ intrusive to users and overshadow useful content . ”
Limit the number of revenue - boosting ads you put on each page , and keep them far enough away from posts and comments so that readers are n’t too distracted .
Sites with too many adverts may also be pushed down search result pages .
Organize and resize photo images : Posting large photos all over your homepage will slow down your blog each time it loads .
Instead of including every photograph next to the original post , tease your readers with a Featured Image or thumbnail , and then provide a link to a gallery page .
This will keep your blog looking fresh and organized , and it wo n’t affect the homepage ’s load time .
Use subheadings for long posts :
Add subtitles to your longer posts “ to break up the text ” and keep readers interested and focused .
You should only have one H1 heading on each page , with all other headings being classified as H2 , H3 and so on .
Maintain a consistent writing style :
Most authors are aware of their own unique writing style .
Maintaining a consistent style is important to readers , who value consistency and the ability to pick up where they left off .
If you are constantly switching back and forth between first person and third person , or if your posts always sound like they ’ve been penned by different authors , your readers wo n’t make the effort to warm up to your erratic writing .
Hone your writing style with these tips .
Post articles regularly : Linda Bustos cites inconsistent posting as one of her top “ sins of blog usability . ”
Post your articles frequently , and according to some kind of schedule , so that your readers can easily follow your new articles .
Be aware of your use of color . : According to Skelliewag.org , paying close attention to your use of color is vital .
Do n’t use light - colored text on a light background or dark text on a dark background , as this design will strain visitors ’ eyes .
Skelliewag maintains that “ black text on white is easiest to read , followed by black on light . ”
Poor contrast may cause problems for readers who have visual impairments .

NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope has discovered some of life 's most basic ingredients in the dust swirling around a young star .
The ingredients - gaseous precursors to DNA and protein - were detected in the star 's terrestrial planet zone , a region where rocky planets such as Earth are thought to be born .
The findings represent the first time that these gases , called acetylene and hydrogen cyanide , have been found in a terrestrial planet zone outside of our own .
" This infant system might look a lot like ours did billions of years ago , before life arose on Earth , " said Fred Lahuis of Leiden Observatory in the Netherlands and the Dutch space research institute called SRON .
Lahuis is lead author of a paper to be published in the Jan. 10 issue of the Astrophysical Journal Letters .
Lahuis and his colleagues spotted the organic , or carbon - containing , gases around a star called IRS 46 .
The star is in the Ophiuchus ( pronounced OFF - ee - YOO - kuss ) , or " snake carrier , " constellation about 375 light - years from Earth .
This constellation harbors a huge cloud of gas and dust in the process of a major stellar baby boom .
Like most of the young stars here and elsewhere , IRS 46 is circled by a flat disk of spinning gas and dust that might ultimately clump together to form planets .
When the astronomers probed this star 's disk with Spitzer 's powerful infrared spectrometer instrument , they were surprised to find the molecular " barcodes " of large amounts of acetylene and hydrogen cyanide gases , as well as carbon dioxide gas .
The team observed 100 similar young stars , but only one , IRS 46 , showed unambiguous signs of the organic mix .
" The star 's disk was oriented in just the right way to allow us to peer into it , " said Lahuis .

The Spitzer data also revealed that the organic gases are hot .
So hot , in fact , that they are most likely located near the star , about the same distance away as Earth is from our sun .
" The gases are very warm , close to or somewhat above the boiling point of water on Earth , " said Dr. Adwin Boogert of the California Institute of Technology , Pasadena .
" These high temperatures helped to pinpoint the location of the gases in the disk . "
Organic gases such as those found around IRS 46 are found in our own solar system , in the atmospheres of the giant planets and Saturn 's moon Titan , and on the icy surfaces of comets .
They have also been seen around massive stars by the European Space Agency 's Infrared Space Observatory , though these stars are thought to be less likely than sun-like stars to form life - bearing planets .
Here on Earth , the molecules are believed to have arrived billions of years ago , possibly via comets or comet dust that rained down from the sky .
Acetylene and hydrogen cyanide link up together in the presence of water to form some of the chemical units of life 's most essential compounds , DNA and protein .
These chemical units are several of the 20 amino acids that make up protein and one of the four chemical bases that make up DNA .
" If you add hydrogen cyanide , acetylene and water together in a test tube and give them an appropriate surface on which to be concentrated and react , you 'll get a slew of organic compounds including amino acids and a DNA purine base called adenine , " said Dr. Geoffrey Blake of Caltech , a co-author of the paper .
" And now , we can detect these same molecules in the planet zone of a star hundreds of light - years away . "
Follow - up observations with the W.M. Keck Telescope atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii confirmed the Spitzer findings and suggested the presence of a wind emerging from the inner region of IRS 46's disk .
This wind will blow away debris in the disk , clearing the way for the possible formation of Earth - like planets .
The Jet Propulsion Laboratory manages the Spitzer Space Telescope mission for NASA 's Science Mission Directorate , Washington .
Science operations are conducted at the Spitzer Science Center at Caltech .
JPL is a division of Caltech .

HOW ONE INDEPENDENT MUSICIAN DEFEATED BMI
© 2003 by Richard Hayes Phillips richardhayesphillips@yahoo.com
http://www.northnet.org/minstrel
It was Memorial Day , and I had just finished the most successful stand of my career on the fringes of the music business .
I had been playing acoustic music at a restaurant in the Hudson Valley for almost a year .
I was their house musician , appearing on holiday weekends and whenever there was a special event that drew hordes of tourists to the town .
I knew that I was in some kind of trouble when the owners , Joe and Kim , asked me to step outside .
They did not appear to be angry with me .
If anything , they seemed about to cry .
" Weíre going to have to stop the music for now , " said Kim .
Then she asked me if I had ever heard of BMI .
I knew that BMI is a worldwide publishing empire that , along with ASCAP , owns the performance rights to " virtually " every song published in the United States .
I also knew that their ubiquitous agents demand and collect licensing fees on an annual basis from owners of restaurants , coffeehouses and bars where copyrighted music is performed .
" But I didnít sing any cover tunes , " I protested .
" I just played a four - hour concert of all original and traditional material . "
" It doesnít matter .
BMI is demanding a license even for Irish music , " said Kim .
" We never heard of BMI before .
We donít know anything about it .
Would you take care of this for us ? "
" Iíd be happy to , " I answered .
" I know the origins of every song that I sing . "
I hoped that BMI would concede my right to sing original and traditional material , and that I would get my job back .
Stunned , in shock , I sat down to eat my grilled salmon salad , the best thing on the menu .
I told a friend what had happened , and I asked him : " What does BMI stand for , anyway ? "
" World domination , " he said .
BMI also stands for " Broadcast Music Incorporated . "
I found this out when Joe brought me a copy of a letter he described as " threatening . "
The letter advised Kim of her " need for a BMI license . "
It claimed that " whatever music you perform to benefit your business , its public performance requires a license . "
It specifically mentioned Irish music .
This was not just one little irate BMI employee trying to make a name for himself .
The letter was written by Craig Stamm , Director of General Licensing at BMI headquarters in Nashville .
I had seen references to ASCAP and BMI on covers of record albums since the early sixties .
I had no idea who they were until the mid-eighties when I encountered frightened restaurant owners in the Connecticut River Valley .
Many of them had received letters , phone calls , or personal visits from agents of BMI or ASCAP ( American Society of Composers , Authors and Publishers ) .
They were told that if any musician ever sang even one ASCAP or BMI song on the premises , they would have to buy a license or be subject to an exorbitant fine .
ASCAP was founded in 1913 , and BMI in 1938 , in order to collect royalties on behalf of songwriters and composers whose works are publicly performed .
They sell blanket licenses , on an annual basis , allowing the performance of any song in their catalogues of representation .
The reasons are obvious : it would be far too cumbersome for the promoter to track down every composer to whom royalties should be paid , or for the composers to track down every promoter who owes them money .
But the licenses are not cheap .
The cost depends upon how many musicians are playing , how often they play , and the maximum allowable occupancy under local fire codes .
Federal copyright law provides for fines of up to $ 30,000 for each copyrighted song performed without a license , and up to $ 150,000 if the infringement is willful , plus attorneyís fees .
This provision would seem to violate the Eighth Amendment under which " excessive fines " are prohibited .
Not wanting my employers to become embroiled in lawsuits or shakedown operations , I stopped singing " cover tunes , " that is , songs written and copyrighted by somebody else .
I have been a songwriter and a traditional singer since the early seventies , which left me with a vast repertoire .
In fact , it gave me a competitive advantage .
I could walk into a restaurant or coffeehouse that had never hired a musician before , and assure them that if they were to hire me and nobody else , they would not need to purchase a license for live performances from ASCAP and BMI .
In this way I found steady employment as the " house musician . "
I encountered the same situation in San Diego in the mid-nineties .
I found only two profit - making enterprises whose owners were not afraid of ASCAP and BMI agents .
Naturally , they became two of my favorite places to play .
The Inner Change Coffeehouse was legendary as a proving ground for singer / songwriters .
Jewel Kilcher was discovered there .
The owner simply chased away ASCAP and BMI agents , correctly pointing out that they were not at all interested in supporting the struggling musicians who performed at her coffeehouse .
I recall having heard only one " cover tune " sung there , by an otherwise all - original rhythm and blues band .
They sang " Mustang Sally , " and the audience had a wonderful time singing along with the refrain : " ride , Sally , ride . "
Presumably those at NASA and elsewhere who sang these words when the astronaut Sally Ride was orbiting the earth were equally guilty of copyright violations .
Mikeyís Coffeehouse was more imaginative in their approach to ASCAP and BMI agents .
They posted signs saying : " ASCAP will not let us pay musicians . "
And they rented the stage for one dollar per night .
In this way it could not be said that Mikeyís was giving the musicians anything of value for their services .
They were on their own to busk for tips and to hawk their CDs .
The owner , of course , was as much at liberty as anybody else to tip the musicians and to buy their recordings .
These two coffeehouses inspired me to write one of my best satires : " Ballad of the ASCAP Agent . "
It was such a hit at the Inner Change that I performed it , by request , three times in one concert .
When I sang it at Mikeyís , people laughed out loud and asked me if the song was copyrighted .
Actually , all my songs are copyrighted , without assistance from ASCAP or BMI .
It ís easy to do .
Just fill out a form , write a check for $ 30 , and send a copy of the work to be copyrighted .
These days the forms are available online at http://www.copyright.gov/forms.
Form TX is for literary works , and Form SR is for sound recordings .
I copyright an entire cassette or CD at a time rather than pay $ 30 every time I write a song .
I specify for each track which of the following I am copyrighting : words , music , arrangement and / or performance .
I state on my CD covers that my recordings are copyrighted in my name .
All rights reserved .
This means exactly what it says .
As the exclusive owner of the copyright , I enjoy the exclusive right of public performance and , BMI notwithstanding , the exclusive right to profit from their performance .
ASCAP and BMI will tell you it is foolish not to join their organizations , because you cannot collect royalties unless you do .
But the truth is that unless you are famous , you are unlikely to collect any royalties even if you do join .
The distribution of royalties is based upon airplay .
ASCAP secretly tapes about 0.1 % of all radio broadcasts each year , and only 1 % of the sampled hours come from public radio stations .
BMI uses radio station logbooks to determine who gets royalties .
Owners of performance venues are required to pay licensing fees even though none of the money will ever go to those who wrote the music being played on their stage , unless it is also being played on the radio .
Little wonder that many owners regard ASCAP and BMI as shakedown operations .
Some have sworn to me that ASCAP is the Mafia .
ASCAP and BMI also consider the playing of a recording in a public place to be a " public performance , " and they demand licensing fees for this as well .
They used to demand licensing fees for playing the radio or television until 1998 , when Sonny Bono succeeded in passing the " Fairness in Music Licensing Act " exempting businesses with little enough floor space and few enough loudspeakers .
ASCAP and BMI can demand licensing fees even for the performance of works whose authors are dead .
Under current law , copyright protection lasts for the life of the artist plus 50 years .
For a corporation , a copyright lasts 75 years .
Every time that valuable copyrights are about to expire , the entertainment industry lobbies for an extension .
In some cases there are identifiable heirs and descendants to receive the royalties .
But I have to agree with Pete Seeger on this one : " The grandchildren should be able to find some other way to make a living , even if their grandfather did write ë How Much Is That Doggie in the Window ? í "
It is my intention to will my copyrights to the public domain , but I will not be around to see if my attempt is successful .
According to Copyright Law , one cannot take the text of a work in the public domain and copyright it .
There may be a valid copyright if there is a similar work in the public domain .
These are called " derivative works . "
They are not wholly original in the sense that they sprang in their entirety from the authorís mind .
But the alteration was the result of original thought and therefore may be copyrighted .
However , the public would not thereby be shut off from the use of the work in the public domain .
A song in the public domain remains there forever .
One can take the text and tune of a work in the public domain and copyright the arrangement and performance .
" Sloop John B. " is a good example .
The song first appeared in Carl Sandburgís " American Songbag , " a book of traditional folk songs .
Sandburg was one of many persons who devoted themselves to collecting and preserving the traditional folk music of the English - speaking world .
The song was recorded by Harry Belafonte , and later made famous by the Beach Boys .
Brian Wilson composed magnificent harmonies and had every right to copyright his arrangement .
But he never claimed to have written the song .
I sing " Sloop John B. " to an African kalimba .
Clearly that is my arrangement , and it is copyrighted .
The unfortunate truth is that anything can be copyrighted , at least for a time .
Unlike the United States Patent Office , there is no one in the Copyright Office to verify the originality of the work to be copyrighted .
However , I know of at least one federal case in which the court ruled that if the antiquity of a song can be proven , the copyright fails .
John and Alan Lomax , who also devoted themselves to collecting and preserving traditional folk music , took the controversial step of copyrighting in their own names the songs they collected , as if they had written the songs themselves .
They even copyrighted original songs collected from other singers , such as Leadbellyís " Good Night Irene . "
This prompted Leadbelly to add a verse to " De Ballad of De Boll Weevil " : " If anybody axes you who it was dat wrote dis song , / Tell ëem it was a black - skinned nigger wid a pair oí blue duckinís on .
/
If anybody axes you who it was dat copyrighted dis song , / Tell ëem Alan Lomax and his goddamned father John . "
Peter , Paul and Mary claim authorship , not merely the arrangement , of at least ten traditional folk songs on their first three albums alone .
In most cases they have changed the titles , and in some cases they have rearranged the lyrics .
In all cases I have seen older versions of the same songs in print .
I , too , have taken liberties with traditional folk songs .
On one of my recordings , " Foote Loose , " there are four renditions in which I combined lyrics from two or more versions of the same folk song .
But I do not claim authorship of these songs .
I have copyrighted the arrangement and performance only .
Anyone who wants to sing these words has my blessing .
I have encountered restaurant and coffeehouse owners who will not allow traditional music to be performed on their stages , for fear that some ASCAP or BMI writer or publisher has copyrighted an arrangement of the song , or even the song itself .
These fears are not unfounded , and the oral tradition , by which these songs have been transmitted from generation to generation , is thereby stifled .
I have carefully preserved over the years photocopies of nearly every traditional song in my repertoire , in order to prove their antiquity .
Suddenly , BMI was forcing me to do just that .
Five days after losing my job at the restaurant I wrote a letter to Craig Stamm , Director of General Licensing at BMI headquarters in Nashville .
I explained that all of my repertoire consists of original or traditional material , and therefore no BMI license is required .
Regarding his written assertion that a BMI license is necessary to perform Irish music , I said : " BMI did not ëbring their musicí to the United States .
Traditional music was brought here from the old country by the settlers themselves .
It is overreaching to assert that ëwhatever music you perform to benefit your business , its public performance requires a license . í
BMI does not own my original compositions or my arrangements of traditional music .
It is beyond my comprehension how BMI could propose to deliver royalties to the authors , or to the descendants of authors , of traditional music .
The authors are unknown .
If you have objections , please name the songs that you believe are not traditional , and I will show that they are . "
After two weeks I had received no response , so I talked to BMI personnel on the telephone .
I was told that the burden of proof is on the business owner to examine a list of 4.5 million songs in the BMI catalog and to prove that none of these songs have been performed .
I was asked how I know that no musician at the restaurant was performing " licensable BMI music . "
I answered that I am their only musician .
I was asked how I know that the songs I sing are not " licensable BMI music . "
I answered that I wrote them myself .
I was told that if the songs are copyrighted , the rights are owned by ASCAP or BMI .
I answered that I copyrighted them myself , without assistance .
I wrote again to Craig Stamm .
I recounted the telephone conversations , and I asked for " a statement , in writing , that I am at liberty to perform my own songs , copyrighted in my name , and traditional folk songs , in the public domain , anywhere I want to , whether or not the venue has a license from BMI . "
I continued : " If I can not get such a statement from BMI , then I will have to seek such a statement from the courts . "
I received no written response from BMI .
When I spoke to Craig Stamm directly on the telephone and asked again for such a statement , he said : " Weíre not going to give you that . "
An ASCAP employee , " very high up " in the organization , was told of my situation and , at first , was not at all sympathetic .
" This story does not sound right , " he said .
" ASCAP would not be able to sue the establishment for not paying performance royalties without the cooperation of the songwriter . "
I assured him that the story was true .
" Perhaps BMI does not play by the same rules , " I said .
" They were demanding money from MY employers for MY performance of MY songs .
BMI certainly did not have the cooperation of the songwriter .
It was BMI that was guilty of copyright infringement , and their actions meet the legal definition of extortion . "
He gave a rather flippant response , which he later retracted : " If the fees paid by a club to ASCAP members for the use of their copyrighted music are enough to drive that nightclub out of business , then that club was teetering on the edge of insolvency anyway .
...
The average fee for an ASCAP blanket license for a bar or restaurant is about $ 500.00 per year .
...
It 's funny how some bar owners are willing to pay for everything they use , except for the music , which is why many people come there in the first place . "
Actually , the owners of the restaurant refused to buy a BMI license for live performances not because they were " teetering on the edge of insolvency . "
The restaurant is a success story , having grown from an ice cream parlor to a lunch and dinner restaurant .
They have the largest wine list in the Hudson Valley , and they also own a liquor store .
They refused to buy the license because they had no live performers who were singing or playing any ASCAP or BMI material .
That the license is cheap enough to be affordable is beside the point .
I can afford to pay more taxes than I do without falling into bankruptcy , but why should I pay what I do not owe ?
Moreover , ASCAP has horror stories of its own .
In 1995 ASCAP sent letters to 6,000 summer camps , including the Girl Scouts , informing them that they had to pay royalties for " public performances . "
Copyright law defines a " public performance " as a place " where a substantial number of persons outside of a normal circle of a family and its social acquaintances is gathered . "
ASCAP did not specifically say that it wanted to charge for singing around the campfire , but the damage was done .
For ASCAP it was a public relations disaster .
And some Girl Scout leaders are still afraid to sing " Puff the Magic Dragon . "
In 1992 an ASCAP undercover agent caught a piano player at a New Jersey restaurant playing George Gershwinís " Rhapsody in Blue " without a license .
ASCAP sued the restaurant and settled out of court for $ 5,500 .
ASCAP has been known to threaten legal action for the singing of " Happy Birthday . "
How do they know ?
Harvey Reid , a musician based in Maine , explains it well .
ASCAP and BMI have field agents on payroll who listen to the radio and watch the newspaper listings .
When a new venue starts offering live music , an agent will either show up in person or write a letter demanding money for the license .
" If a nightclub or even a store refuses to buy the license , then ASCAP or BMI will hire spies , often local music teachers or semi-professional musicians who will make notes and testify in court as expert witnesses that on a certain date at a certain time a certain song was indeed played .
...
Note that even though the musicians or the employees decide what is played it is the owner of the establishment where the music is played who gets sued . "
To see the full text of Harvey Reidís article , " ASCAP and BMI : Protectors of Artists or Shadowy Thieves ? " go to http://www.woodpecker.com.
I was well aware that few , if any , have ever won a lawsuit against ASCAP or BMI .
But I am not easily intimidated .
I researched 63 years of copyright case law and began contacting attorneys .
Many were willing to talk with me .
But none were willing to take the case .
Every lawyer I talked to urged me to look at RICO , a federal law which stands for " Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations . "
The actions of BMI , demanding money from my employers for my performance of my songs , appear to fall within the definition of extortion as incorporated by RICO : " the obtaining of property from another , with his consent , induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force , violence , or fear , or under color of official right . "
Under case law , it does not matter whether the attempt was successful ; attempted extortion is extortion .
Knowing that making a federal case out of this would be expensive , stressful , and time - consuming , I sought help from elected Democrats and liberal groups .
I was turned down by Senator Charles Schumer , Senator Hillary Clinton , New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer , the American Civil Liberties Union , the National Lawyersí Guild , and Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts .
Then , on New Yearís Eve , I received a letter from Congressman John McHugh ( R , NY ) .
At first I thought it was a bulk mailing .
I was irritated to receive it from a politician who had not even answered my inquiry .
I was in for a surprise .
Congressman McHugh had forwarded my letter to the United States Copyright Office and had elicited a response from Marilyn Kretsinger , Assistant General Counsel .
I should not have been surprised .
John McHugh had stood up for north country artists before , and no doubt he will do it again .
Marilyn Kretsinger upheld each of my contentions .
In her words , " BMI has the authority to issue a license only for those songs that are in its catalogue of representation . "
If the performance venue does not " publicly perform songs represented by BMI , " then a BMI license is not needed .
She further stated : " With respect to the musical compositions that Mr. Phillips has authored , no performance license is necessary since Mr. Phillips is the copyright owner of those songs . "
With respect to traditional folk songs in the public domain , if I am " not performing a copyrighted arrangement of a public domain folk song , then a BMI license is not required .
The opinion has far - reaching implications for independent musicians and for the entrepreneurs who hire them .
No venue is in need of a performance license unless one or more of its musicians are performing compositions or arrangements copyrighted and licensed through ASCAP , BMI or SESAC .
The copyright owner enjoys exclusive performance rights and , therefore , the exclusive right to profit from their performance .
The point is so obvious that it has never been litigated , which makes this a landmark decision .

Appendix BMI .
But I never did get my job back .
The restaurant owners have decided not to have any live performances or to play any recorded music .
To them it is not worth the hassle .
The customers must settle for radio and television .
And I have not found such a lucrative job since .
Such is the legacy of BMI .
And the lethal amateurishness of these loyal Bushies on the make horrifies the corporate elite almost as much as it horrifies ordinary Americans .
Last but not least , even corporations are relieved to see the end of what amounted to a protection racket .
In a classic 2003 article in The Washington Monthly , Nicholas Confessore ( now at The New York Times ) described the efforts of people like former Senator Rick Santorum to turn K Street into an appendage of the Republican Party — not the other way around .
“ The corporate lobbyists who once ran the show , loyal only to the parochial interests of their employer , ” wrote Mr. Confessore , “ are being replaced by party activists who are loyal first and foremost to the G.O.P . ”
But corporations were n’t happy .
According to The Politico , “ many C.E.O. ’s ” used the term “ extortion ” to describe “ the annual shakedowns by committee chairmen with jurisdiction over their industries . ”
And now that Mr. Santorum is out of office , heading the America ’s Enemies program at a right - wing think tank , the faint sound you hear from K Street is that of lobbyists singing : “ Ding , dong , the witch is dead . ”
All of this greatly increases the odds that the Republicans , far from establishing a permanent majority , will be out of power for quite a while .
But it also raises the question of what Democratic rule will really mean .
Right now all the leading contenders for the Democratic nomination are running on strongly progressive platforms — especially on health care .
But there remain real concerns about what they would actually do in office .
Here ’s an example of the sort of thing that makes you wonder : yesterday ABC News reported on its
Web site that the Clinton campaign is holding a “ Rural Americans for Hillary ” lunch and campaign briefing — at the offices of the Troutman Sanders Public Affairs Group , which lobbies for the agribusiness and biotech giant Monsanto .
You do n’t have to be a Naderite to feel uncomfortable about the implied closeness .
I ’d put it this way : many progressives , myself included , hope that the next president will be another F.D.R .
But we worry that he or she will turn out to be another Grover Cleveland instead — better - intentioned and much more competent than the current occupant of the White House , but too dependent on lobbyists ’ money to seriously confront the excesses of our new Gilded Age .
Despite all the claims of improvements , 2007 has been the worst year yet in Iraq .
One of the first big moves this year was the launch of a troop “ surge ” by the U.S. government in mid-February .
The goal was to improve security in Baghdad and the western al - Anbar province , the two most violent areas .
By June , an additional 28,000 troops had been deployed to Iraq , bringing the total number up to more than 160,000 .
By autumn , there were over 175,000 U.S. military personnel in Iraq .
This is the highest number of U.S. troops deployed yet , and while the U.S. government continues to talk of withdrawing some , the numbers on the ground appear to contradict these promises .
The Bush administration said the “ surge ” was also aimed at curbing sectarian killings , and to gain time for political reform for the government of U.S. - backed Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki .
During the surge , the number of Iraqis displaced from their homes quadrupled , according to the Iraqi Red Crescent .
By the end of 2007 , the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) estimated that there are over 2.3 million internally displaced persons within Iraq , and over 2.3 million Iraqis who have fled the country .
Iraq has a population around 25 million .
The non-governmental organization Refugees International describes Iraq ’s refugee problem as “ the world ’s fastest growing refugee crisis . ”
In October the Syrian government began requiring visas for Iraqis .
Until then it was the only country to allow Iraqis in without visas .
The new restrictions have led some Iraqis to return to Baghdad , but that number is well below 50,000 .
A recent UNHCR survey of families returning found that less than 18 percent did so by choice .
Most came back because they lacked a visa , had run out of money abroad , or were deported .
Sectarian killings have decreased in recent months , but still continue .
Bodies continue to be dumped on the streets of Baghdad daily .
One reason for a decrease in the level of violence is that most of Baghdad has essentially been divided along sectarian lines .
Entire neighborhoods are now surrounded by concrete blast walls several meters high , with strict security checkpoints .
Normal life has all but vanished .
The Iraqi Red Crescent estimates that eight out of ten refugees are from Baghdad .
By the end of 2007 , attacks against occupation forces decreased substantially , but still number more than 2,000 monthly .
Iraqi infrastructure , like supply of potable water and electricity are improving , but remain below pre-invasion levels .
Similarly with jobs and oil exports .
Unemployment , according to the Iraqi government , ranges between 60 - 70 percent .
An Oxfam International report released in July says 70 percent of Iraqis lack access to safe drinking water , and 43 percent live on less than a dollar a day .
The report also states that eight million Iraqis are in need of emergency assistance .
“ Iraqis are suffering from a growing lack of food , shelter , water and sanitation , healthcare , education , and employment , ” the report says .
“ Of the four million Iraqis who are dependent on food assistance , only 60 percent currently have access to rations through the government - run Public Distribution System ( PDS ) , down from 96 percent in 2004 . ”
Nearly 10 million people depend on the fragile rationing system .
In December , the Iraqi government announced it would cut the number of items in the food ration from ten to five due to “ insufficient funds and spiraling inflation . ”
The inflation rate is officially said to be around 70 percent .
The cuts are to be introduced in the beginning of 2008 , and have led to warnings of social unrest if measures are not taken to address rising poverty and unemployment .
Iraq ’s children continue to suffer most .
Child malnutrition rates have increased from 19 percent during the economic sanctions period prior to the invasion , to 28 percent today .
This year has also been one of the bloodiest of the entire occupation .
The group Just Foreign Policy , “ an independent and non-partisan mass membership organization dedicated to reforming U.S. foreign policy , ” estimates the total number of Iraqis killed so far due to the U.S. - led invasion and occupation to be 1,139,602 .
This year 894 U.S. soldiers have been killed in Iraq , making 2007 the deadliest year of the entire occupation for the U.S. military , according to ICasualties.org .
To date , at least 3,896 U.S. troops have been killed in Iraq , according to the U.S. Department of Defense .
A part of the U.S. military ’s effort to reduce violence has been to pay former resistance fighters .
Late in 2007 , the U.S. military began paying monthly wages of 300 dollars to former militants , calling them now “ concerned local citizens . ”
While this policy has cut violence in al - Anbar , it has also increased political divisions between the dominant Shia political party and the Sunnis  the majority of these “ concerned citizens ” being paid are Sunni Muslims .
Prime Minister Maliki has said these “ concerned local citizens ” will never be part of the government ’s security apparatus , which is predominantly composed of members of various Shia militias .
Underscoring another failure of the so - called surge is the fact that the U.S. - backed government in Baghdad remains more divided than ever , and hopes of reconciliation have vanished .
According to a recent ABC / BBC poll , 98 percent of Sunnis and 84 percent of Shia in Iraq want all U.S. forces out of the country .
Inter Press Service
Special Report
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Distressed borrowers looking for relief from the recently announced White House foreclosure prevention plan may be in for a disappointment .
In announcing the administration 's plan , which includes a five - year freeze on interest rate hikes for some subprime borrowers with adjustable - rate mortgages ( ARMs ) , the White House estimated it would offer relief to 1.2 million families out of the 1.8 million facing higher interest rates .
The initiative comes at a time of record high foreclosure rates .
But there are very strict limitations .
Sharon Reuss , a spokeswoman for the Center for responsible Lending , estimated it would help 7 percent of those stuck with unaffordable subprime loans , or 145,000 borrowers .
" This is so limited in scope , " she said .
The guidelines on who can be helped are spelled out by the American Securitization Forum ( ASF ) , which represents the players in the securitization process , including lenders , those who service the loans and investors who hold the debt .
The ASF guidelines limit the interest rate freeze solely to those borrowers who are unable to afford payments if they rise above their introductory rates .
These normally adjust higher after the first two ( 2/28 ARMs ) or three ( 3/27 ARMs ) years of the loans .
Left out are both the people who can afford to continue payments even after rates adjust higher and those who cannot afford the loan even at the low initial rates .
Further limitations are that the loans must have been made between Jan. 1 , 2005 and July 31 , 2007 and have been included in securitized pools .
Rates must be scheduled to reset no earlier than Jan. 1 , 2008 and no later than July 31 , 2010 and the restructuring process must begin before the loans reset .
To determine affordability , the plan would use readily available criteria , especially credit ( FICO ) scores .
These must not exceed 660 or have gained more than 10 percent since the origination of the mortgage .
In either of those cases , borrowers have failed the FICO test and must apply for another type of rework .
" It 's very likely these people will be able to refinance into a fixed rate loan , " said Tom Deutsch , Deputy Executive Director of the ASF .
Deutsch helped write the guidelines .
Even if loans qualify for a freeze , servicers , according to the ASF guidelines , will not take any actions that violate contracts or applicable laws .
Additionally , the loan - to - value - ratio of the mortgage must be more than 97 percent .
That is , the owner must owe more ( or close to it ) than the home is actually worth ( see correction at end of story ) .
Servicers of any second mortgages on the homes must agree to cooperate .
And candidates for a freeze must be current on their monthly payments ; they can not be more than 30 days late nor have been 60 days late more than once in the previous 12 months .
Also , if borrowers qualify for an FHASecure loan , the freeze is not available to them .
Borrowers must also be owner / occupiers as opposed to speculators .
And the reset has to send payments up by at least 10 percent , which should not be a difficult hurdle ; typically , these loans will reset from around 7 or 8 percent to at least 9 or 10 percent .
Any modifications must maximize profits for investors and be in their best interests .
Especially in a falling market , investors are usually better off taking smaller profits of modifications than major losses brought on by foreclosures .
Some critics wonder individual reworks will need to gain approvals from investors .
That would be a monumental task .
The loans are often carved up and sold in pieces to investors all over the world .
According to Deutsch , however , mortgage servicers have the authority to make the modifications .
" A key point , " he said , " is that servicers are responsible for making these decisions based on the entirety of the interest of the trust , " ( the investors ) .
According to Mary Moore , of the Center for Responsible Lending , however , servicers may have reasons of their own to pursue foreclosure rather than working with borrowers to keep them in their homes .
" Servicers can have incentives to foreclose , " she said .
" They sometimes have affiliates who work on foreclosures - that generates a lot of income for the affiliates . "
As for the Bush plan , Moore welcomes it , but with no great enthusiasm .
" We would love to see further steps , " she said , " but we have no indication that more is coming . "
An earlier version of this story stated that the loan - to - value ratio must be lower than 97 percent to qualify for a freeze in rates .
Candidates for the freeze must have a loan - to - value ratio above 97 percent .
( Fortune Magazine ) -- Eye surgeon Virendar Sangwan has perfected a procedure so cutting - edge that most who have tried it have failed .
In an operating theater in the central Indian city of Hyderabad , he surgically implants corneas grown in a petri dish from stem cells by his colleague Geeta Vemuganti in patients with damaged eyes .
Together they perform about 80 corneal regeneration procedures a year , making the L.V. Prasad Eye Institute where they work one of the most prolific facilities in the world using stem cells to regenerate tissue of any kind .
The Sangwan - Vemuganti team uses stem cells found in the tissues of living adults , not ones derived from embryos .
Teams all over the world are working with adult stem cells , trying to coax them to regrow cells in hearts , brains , livers , and other organs , but progress is slow .
Besides corneas , scientists have had some success regrowing skin cells and bone tissue , but those procedures remain experimental .
" A number of programs around the world have tried to perfect this treatment , but they have had bad outcomes , " says University of Cincinnati eye surgeon and stem cell specialist Edward Holland .
" It 's impressive what they are doing at Prasad . "
In addition to the Hyderabad project , only Holland 's program and a half - dozen others in the world conduct operations using corneas grown from stem cells .
The treatment uses stem cells harvested from the limbus , located where the cornea touches the white of the eye .
For those with damaged corneas , these cells - called " limbic " and " conjunctiva " - are harvested from a patient 's good eye , if he has one , or from a close relative .
They are placed in a petri dish and chemically tweaked to grow into the lower layer of a cornea , called the epithelium .
It is then transplanted into the eye of the patient , where in most cases it takes hold and grows .
In 56 % of the cases at the Prasad Institute , patients could still see clearly 40 months later .
That is what 47 - year - old Nuthalapati Partha Saradhi hopes will happen to him .
In 1993 he was riding his motorbike with his wife through the nighttime streets of Hyderabad when someone jumped out of the shadows and threw acid at the couple .
The chemical scalded a large swath of flesh on Saradhi's face , singeing his eyes and destroying both corneas .
His wife suffered severe burns , but her eyes were uninjured .
Saradhi spent 12 years as a blind man , undergoing multiple surgeries and skin grafts , until he heard about Sangwan 's procedure .
The formerly blind Saradhi tears up when he recalls the day his bandages came off after his operation in 2005 .
" I immediately had back the vision - very clear vision , " he says .
The first thing he saw was Sangwan , then his brother , wife , and children , including his youngest , born after the attack .
" I cried for about ten minutes , " he recalls .
Sangwan was able to repair only one eye ; the other was too badly burned , so Saradhi wears a glass eye , also made at the institute .
" I am now able to drive a car , " Saradhi says proudly , holding up his driver 's license .
Indians are well known for reverse engineering , meaning they can deduce how drugs are made in order to produce generic versions .
But in this case , Sangwan and Vemuganti , a pathologist , developed the technique on their own from reading papers and running experiments in the lab .
Sangwan says he had a number of patients with burned eyes who could not be helped with standard corneal transplants from cadavers , so he persuaded Vemuganti to try growing corneas in her lab .
" You know how to grow cells , and I know how to do the transplant surgery , " Vemuganti recalls him saying .
" Why do n't we work together ? "
She smiles and shakes her head .
" I had no clue if this was going to work . "
Vemuganti's major innovation was developing a platform on which to grow the corneas .
First she designed a circular glass tube about the size of a stack of coins .
" I had the handyman here cut the glass for me , " she says .
Then she overlaid the glass with tissue from a human placenta , which is " a good surface to grow the corneas on , " she says .
After that she placed stem cells in four places around a circle , added a growth medium , and watched the corneas begin to grow .
Founded in 1986 , the Prasad Institute is named after the Bollywood producer who provided initial funding .
The hospital performs 25,000 eye surgeries a year , ranging from cataract removal to LASIK procedures .
The institute receives a small number of medical tourists from Europe and the U.S. ; more come from the Middle East , Africa , and Asia .
A swank suite called the Pavilion serves wealthy patients , who pay five - star - hotel rates for rooms .
Lower - income patients can receive the corneal procedure for free .
The more affluent pay up to $ 1,500 - about one - tenth of what is charged in the U.S. for similar treatment .
Commercial interest among stem cell companies for the procedure has been scant because of the perceived small volume of patients , says venture capitalist Antoun Nabhan of Bay City Capital , who sits on the board of Cellerant , a leading stem cell company in San Carlos , Calif .
But corneal stem cell treatment may have wider applications , says ophthalmologist Ivan Schwab of the University of California at Davis .
" These stem cells are similar to others in the body that make mucous membrane , " he says .
" These techniques of growing stem cells might one day be used to treat mucous - membrane tissue in the sinuses , bladder , and other organs . "
For now , though , it 's corneas that are making an enormous difference in the lives of blinded Indians .
While Saradhi's face remains scarred with wine - colored stains from the skin grafts , in the midst of his damaged visage gleams a healthy eye , with a brown iris and a clear cornea no longer opaque and sightless .
" I was very much happy .
My children are so very much happy , " he says .
" It was a miracle . "
A matter of priorities
As a rule , “ gotcha ” political interviews make for good television , but that ’s about all they do .
Russert , Blitzer , & Co. will confront a policy maker with some old quote , pause for dramatic effect , and leave the interviewee temporarily flummoxed .
Whether there ’s a point to the exchange is oftentimes irrelevant .
That said , occasionally “ gotcha ” moments tell us quite a bit .
Take , for example , this terrific interview on MSNBC yesterday between David Shuster and Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee .
Shuster ’s point , obviously , is one of hypocrisy .
First , Blackburn is outraged with “ General Betray Us , ” because it came from a liberal group , but she ’s blase about “ Senator Betray Us , ” because it came from Rush Limbaugh .
And second , Blackburn is consumed with the New York Times — including discussion of its stock price and staffing layoffs — but she knows nothing about Jeremy Bohannan , an 18 - year - old soldier , who was the last American from her district killed in Iraq .
Asked why she knows all about Move On and the NYT , but nothing about Jeremy Bohannan , Blackburn said , “ I do not know why I did not know the name , ” but added , “ You ’re exactly right .
I can say chapter and verse what was going on with MoveOn.org . ”
Responded Shuster , “ [ Y ] ou were not appreciative enough to know the name of this young man .
He was 18 years old and killed .
Yet you can say chapter and verse about what ’s going on with the New York Times and MoveOn.org . ”
“ Gotcha ” interviewing ?
Sure .
A worthwhile point about Republican lawmakers ’ misplaced priorities ?
Absolutely .
If you ca n’t watch the video , the transcript is the next best thing :
SHUSTER : The Republican outcry is beginning to die down over that MoveOn ad , the one running in the “ New York Times ” that posed the question — General Petraeus or General Betray Us ?
But there ’s a bigger question left unanswered , a question of hypocrisy when it comes to political attack .
Where was the outrage when Rush Limbaugh said this about Republican Senator Chuck Hagel over one of the senator ’s stances on Iraq ?
Limbaugh said , “ by the way , we had a caller call , could n’t stay on the air , got a new name for Senator Hagel of Nebraska .
We got General Petraeus and Senator Betray - Us , new name for Senator Hagel . ”
Here to discuss all this is Marsha Blackburn , a Republican Congresswoman from Tennessee .
Congresswoman , thanks for coming in .
REP .
MARSHA BLACKBURN ( R ) , TENNESSEE : Good to be with you .
SHUSTER : Do you want to take this opportunity to condemn what Rush Limbaugh said about Chuck Hagel ?
BLACKBURN : What I want to do is talk about the “ New York Times . ”
Probably , Rush Limbaugh could have gotten by without saying that .
SHUSTER : Could of gotten by ?
It was wrong , was n’t it ?
BLACKBURN : He was referencing what a caller said .
SHUSTER : But it was wrong for a caller or for Rush Limbaugh to call Chuck Hagel Senator Betray Us , right ?
BLACKBURN : But Rush Limbaugh did not go in and buy an ad and place it with the “ New York Times ” and get a special , preferred rate — SHUSTER :
So there ’s a difference between buying an ad in the “ New York Times ” and Rush Limbaugh hearing something that he likes to hear from one of his viewers and repeating it on the air .
What ’s the distinction ?
BLACKBURN : Rush Limbaugh should not have done that .
But Rush Limbaugh did not go out and buy an ad and circumvent the “ New York Times . ”
It takes two weeks for them to tell the truth on this and we find out that they did get a favored rate .
SHUSTER : They did n’t know they got a favored rate .
As soon as they found out they got a favored rate , they wrote a check .
BLACKBURN : I do n’t believe that .
I think they did — SHUSTER : I understand that this is an issue that —
You ’re very concerned , of course , about the MoveOn ad , is that right ?
BLACKBURN : Everybody is concerned about the MoveOn ad .
Everybody is concerned about what seems to be the violation of the public trust by the “ New York Times . ”
Look , we all know that their circulation is down , that their stock is down , that they — I think it was last year fired 500 people .
Everyone is aware of that .
My goodness , to find out now that they are fire selling their ad space .
SHUSTER : Congressman , let ’s talk about the public trust .
You represent , of course , a district in western Tennessee .
What was the name of the last soldier from your district who was killed in Iraq ?
BLACKBURN : The name of the last soldier killed in Iraq , from my district , I do not know .
SHUSTER : His name was Jeremy Bohannan ( ph ) .
He was killed August 9 , 2007 .
How come you did not know that the name ?
BLACKBURN : I do not know why I did not know the name .
We made contact with the families in our district .
When you have a major military post , you are very sensitive to this and sensitive to working with those families , and that is something that my staff and I do daily .
Our district director is a gentleman who has served in the U.S. Army and currently serves in the National Guard .
And we do everything that we possibly can do to assist those families .
We are very appreciative of the sacrifice .
SHUSTER : But you were not appreciative enough to know the name of this young man .
He was 18 years old and killed .
Yet you can say chapter and verse about what ’s going on with the “ New York Times ” and MoveOn.org .
BLACKBURN : You ’re exactly right .
I can say chapter and verse what was going on with MoveOn.org .
SHUSTER : Do n’t you understand the problems that a lot of people would have , that you ’re so focused on an ad .
When was the last time a “ New York Times ” ad ever killed somebody ?
Yet here we have a war that took the life of an 18 - year - old kid , Jeremy Bohannan , from your district and you did n’t know his name ?
BLACKBURN : Well — and — we work very closely , as I said , with those families . [… ]
SHUSTER : I agree , Congresswoman , do you stay in touch with these military families .
But I again , I still think it ’s a little surprising that you did not know the name of the last soldier killed in Iraq , who is only 18 years old , and yet you know so much about the MoveOn.org ad and the tactics you do n’t like .
It ’s interesting .
Keith Olbermann has his own show , and it ’s the high - rated program on MSNBC prime - time .
If the network were to , say , give David Shuster his own show , alongside Olbermann , MSNBC would probably get quite a ratings bump .

The daughter of a British imam is living under police protection after receiving death threats from her father for converting to Christianity .
The 31 - year - old , whose father is the leader of a mosque in Lancashire , has moved house an astonishing 45 times after relatives pledged to hunt her down and kill her .
The British - born university graduate , who uses the pseudonym Hannah for her own safety , said she renounced the Muslim faith to escape being forced into an arranged marriage when she was 16 .
She has been in hiding for more than a decade but called in police only a few months ago after receiving a text message from her brother .
In it , he said he would not be held responsible for his actions if she failed to return to Islam .
Officers have agreed to offer her protection in case of an attempt on her life .
Last night the woman said : " I 'm determined to live my life the way I want to because I should have that freedom in this country .
" If you make the choice to come to this country , as my parents did from Pakistan , you have to abide by the laws of this country and that means respecting the freedoms of other people .
Scroll down for more ...
" I know the Koran says anyone who goes away from Islam should be killed as an apostate , so in some ways my family are following the Koran .
They are following Islam to the word .
" But I do not think every Muslim would act on that .
" My situation is frightening , but I 'm not going to let it frighten me to the extent I can't live my life .
" I pretty much feel like I 've lost my family and that 's very hard .
" Some days I feel very low and what my father might do preys on my mind .
But I regularly change my phone number to avoid him catching up with me .'
Hannah was born in Lancashire to Pakistani parents who raised her and her siblings as strict Sunni Muslims .
She prayed and read the Koran , wore traditional Muslim clothes and was sent to a madrassa , a religious Muslim school .
She ran away from home at 16 after overhearing her father organising her arranged marriage .
Hannah was taken in by a religious education teacher and decided to convert to the Christian faith .
Although unhappy , her parents tolerated their daughter 's dismissal - of Islam as a " teenage phase " .
But when she opted to get baptised , while studying at Manchester University , her family were incensed and the death threats began .
Her father arrived at her home with 40 men and threatened to kill her for betraying Islam .
" I saw my uncle and around 40 men storming up the street clutching axes , hammers , knives and bits of wood , " she said .
" My dad was shouting through the letter box , " I 'm going to kill you " , while the others smashed on the window and beat the door .
" They were shouting , ' We 're going to kill you ' and ' Traitor ' .
" It was terrifying .
I was convinced I was going to either die , but suddenly after about ten minutes the noise stopped and the men suddenly went away . "
Since then Hannah , who gives talks to churches on Islam , has been on the run from her family , often being forced to flee her home with only a few minutes ' notice .
After receiving the latest text threat from her brother , in June , she finally went to the police .
No one has been arrested or charged in connection with the death threats , but officers have put her on an " at risk " register and have given her a panic number to call if she fears for her own safety .
Yesterday Dr Michael Nazir - Ali , the Bishop of Rochester , told delegates at the launch of a religious charity that Muslims in Britain who wished to change faiths were living in fear of their lives because of Islamic hostility to conversion .
A study this year found that 36 per cent of British Muslims between 16 and 24 believe those who convert to another religion should be punished by death .
In July an Iranian immigrant to Britain , who converted to Christianity , was saved from deportation after it emerged she would be stoned to death in her own country .

Note that IP Innovation and Apple settled ( .pdf ) . sometime in June , terms apparently not disclosed .
June 15 , 2007
.... announced today that IP Innovation , a wholly owned subsidiary that is part of Acacia Technologies group , has entered into a Settlement and License Agreement with Apple Inc. covering patents that relate to graphical user interface ( " GUI " ) systems .
The Agreement resolves patent litigation that was pending in the District Court for the Eastern District of Texas with respect to certain Apple products .
The implication being , that it freed them up to pursue bigger targets ( ouch ! ) .

The patent cites several earlier patents , at least seven of which are more than
twenty years old .
( i.e. , prior to October 1987 . )
It is certainly not clear from
the abstract how this patent can possible be non-obvious based on the titles of
the cited patents , much less on any deeper reading .
What is the magic date for prior art now ? 17 years ? 20 years ?
I 'm almost certain
that this patent 's claims were already implemented in Xemacs and probably in
EMACS itself , in addition to a other early GUIs .
Time to do some historical
research ! [ Reply to This | # ]

This would be counterproductive to Microsoft 's apparent linux / patent strategy .
After all , their whole schtick is that if you buy from Novell you 're safe from
patent attacks - in an attempt to coerce the rest of the Linux distributors to
line up for the same " pay MS protection money " deal .
Suing Novell just makes it crystal clear that everyone is in the same boat ;
Novell is no safer than any other distro .
It demonstrates quite clearly that the
" Novell is safer " emperor has no clothes .
This sounds like an independent patent troll who thinks that SCO 's mistake was
just poor execution , and they can get rich quick by getting a cut of every Linux
sale .
You 'd think they 'd learn ...
But I do n't think Microsoft is dumb enough to
be actively working against their own strategy .

If a patent expires 20 years from the date of filing ( May of 1987 ) , and cannot
be renewed , is this not already out of date and hence moot ?

A couple of questions .
1 . What is the impact of the fact that RedHat and Novell are not writing that
code , but only distributing it ?
Multiple desktops are implemented in particular
programs in specific desktop environments .
For example , KDE3 uses kicker to do
it .
RedHat and Novell certainly did not create that , but the KDE team ( in
Europe where there are n't software patents ) did .
2 . What are the issues of distros like Ubuntu ( South Africa ? ) and Mandrivia
( France ) distributing the same code via the internet ?
3 . What about Dell distributing Ubuntu on their systems ?
I think I remember the Supreme Court taking a case about suing up and down the
line .
That may well have an impact here .
4 . Is this an opportunity to get software patents thrown out completely ?

I 'd like to point out that it is quite possible to run Linux without any GUI
system or windows at all .
Might be a relatively minor point , but this patent
appears to me to cover virtual window managers that implement multiple
desktops .
I confess I do n't quite exactly understand what the patent does and does not
cover because the language is so .
. . abstract .
But it definitely has to do with
graphical display systems .

When you sue someone over patent infringement , can you do it without warning , or
do you go through a process of asking the infringer to
cease - and - desist - and / or - pay - up first ?
RedHat has been fairly pro-active about excluding patented stuff ( e.g. , MP3 ) , so
one suspects that if they already knew about this patent , they 've already
researched it fairly thoroughly and decided to ignore it .

My Amiga Computer did this type of
windowing - and used the exact same type of data structires to keep track of the
workspaces ( you could have more than one and more than one screen - more than
one window - etc ..... ) back in the 1980's .... Prior Art? [ Reply to This | # ]

I think I know to what they are referring .
It 's not a GUI , but rather a
windowing GUI , i.e. having several graphically represented tasks ' on the screen '
at the same time and being able to manouver between them .
E.g. windows .

It 's easy to find Microsoft , just follow the trail of buzzwords -- technology !
innovation !
intellectual property !
licensing !
The density of those buzzwords in any given paragraph is a good indicator of ' getting warm ' in your quest for the secretive , shadowy Microsoft .
Microsoft - speak spills over from the public side to the undercover side .
The recent judgment of the European Court of First Instance against Microsoft is overflowing , throughout , with those buzzwords .
Apart from the fact that Microsoft fails to explain what it means by technology  in this context , it would be extremely difficult to draw a distinction between technological  intellectual property rights and non-technological intellectual property rights .
Nor is it certain that the interoperability information at issue constitutes such technology , in particular if it represents what is a purely arbitrary convention without any innovative character .
-- JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE ( Grand Chamber ) 2007 -09 - 17 , paragraph 683 ( If you read the entire judgment , you might get the impression that neither the Court nor the Commission were overly impressed with Microsoft endlessly chanting those words as if sacred ) .
Every where Microsoft goes , it sprinkles liberal doses of those buzzwords as if they are magic fairy dust that will keep everyone who is exposed to them from noticing that ( a ) Microsoft does n't innovate , except in licensing ( b ) even a hammer qualifies as " technology " , ( c ) " intellectual property " is not a homestead , but rather castles built in air , and ( d ) ever more complex licensing schemes for the same old crusty code in new wrappers is not everyone 's idea of rapture .
IP Innovation LLC ?
Oh , come on !
Surely there is someone left in the bowels of Microsoft who could fit " technology " and " licensing " into that name .
Maybe there is a Surreptitious Evangelism Department in which heads are rolling over that slip - up even now .

While people are looking for prior art , do n't forget to look at the
Amiga operating system , and even the Atari operating system (
TOS ) .
They date back to 1984 , and the Amiga operating
system made the windoze look like it was designed in
kindergarten by kids with one hand tied behind their back .
It
was a real graphics based system with the GUI so well
integrated that a person never really thought about the
underlying Unix , or most likely , BSD code .
I suspect the MS killed the system by forcing Gateway , who
bought the rights to the system , to shelve it if they wanted to
continue selling windoze .
I still have working Amigas and lots of the original manuals and
will be happy to help if I can be pointed in the directions I need
to search .

Call me stupid .
I do n't follow the legal arguements , but obviously , someone at
this picnic is full of it .
Obviously , I think that FOSS is in the right .
So , what can I , an average guy with a fine sense of what 's right versus what 's
leagel to do ?
Who do I send a small but heartfelt check to so that this insanaty
can be fought ?
Anyone ?
I 'd be most comfortable with an answer from MathFox or PJ ( obviously ) ,
but other trusted sources would be welcome .
AC 's should be avoided in case they
are not fightings the good fight for what is right ...

I seem to remember that some of the old , pre 1980 , Digital VT series of terminals
used to allow you to switch between work spaces .
You could plug in 2 or more
serial lines and from the keyboard switch between multiple displays or ' work
spaces ' if you will .

From the patent 's abstract :- Single screen display system with multiple virtual display having prioritized service programs and dedicated memory stacks
System for electronically displaying portions of several different images on a CRT screen through respective prioritized viewports
These capabilities are available from at least ( AFAICT ) 1989 on Microsoft 's ( TM ) Windows ( TM ) operating system .
AFAICT , again , the X windowing sytem ( XFree86 and X.org ) uses a different scheme from what is described in the patent abstract .
I cannot say same about M$ ( TM ) Windows ( TM ) coz I am not sure about its internals ....
It is strange that the patent holder choose to remain silent though X code is available for public , unrestricted use for so long .
They could have easily examined the X system and verified whether their patents were infringed .
Clearly , this is a case of ( at least ) absence of due diligence and non-enforcement .

Hmm ... perhaps we 're setting up a morality play here ?

... Microsoft will be able to come forward and indemnify Novell due to their
patent agreement with each other .
There will be behind - the - scenes negotiation
with IP Innovation and Novell will suddenly be dropped from the case , leaving
... Red Hat on its own .
Microsoft will then hit the press with , " See how
our agreement with Novell protected them , you should all sign here now .
This
case proves that companies must sign patent protection agreements with us or
else . "
It 's just a big setup .

Okay , I 'm a little confused , being a novice to patent law .
Their complaint
states that Red Hat and Novell have infringed on at least claim 1 of the ' 412
patent ( 62 claims total ) , at least claim 3 of the ' 183 patent ( 17 claims total ) ,
and at least claim 1 of the ' 521 patent ( 27 claims total ) .
To me , it does n't
make sense that somebody could infringe on a patent just by infringing on 3
claims of 106 ( between three patents ) .
I always thought that the derivative
nature of most patents meant that some claims might naturally include pieces of
prior patents or other art , yet when considered as a whole , the patent was
unique and innovative in nature .
If I were to develop an invention made from Velcro that cures cancer and decodes
the human genome , my first claim might include " a system comprising two
pieces of fabric with hook and loop connectors " .
That does n't mean that I
can go suing everybody that makes hook and loop fasteners for infringing my
patent , just because their respective products match claim 1 .
It 's the totality
of the patent that defines my invention , so an infringing use should have to be
something that covers that totality .
Am I just completely ignorant of patent law , or am I just missing something
obvious ?

Before everyone starts jumping on analyzing this patent , please be aware that
public analysis at this stage could be harmful to the defendents .
The patent
troll has claimed that RedHat and Novell infringe this patent , but the complaint
does not give any justification at all for that claim .
At some stage IP innovation will have to specify very precisely what code
infringes , and exactly how it infringes .
This is much harder than it may seem .
It is quite possible that their job will be a lot easier if they have a whole
lot of public analysis by members of the free software community to draw on .
That could , for example , allow them to tune their detailed complaint to avoid
any pitfalls that are found by public analysis .
So before we start on any detailed public analysis , we need some input from
RedHat / Novell on whether they actually need help with this analysis , or whether
they would prefer we all just bide our time .
It is quite possible that this troll does n't have a watertight case , and they
filed this complaint hoping that the details of exactly what code infringes and
exactly how it infringes will be filled in by the free software community when
it goes public .
Anyone from RedHat / Novell like to comment ?
I 'm sure the groklaw community can do
a really detailed word by word dissection and claim chart for you .
Do you want
that help ?
Would it do more harm than good at this stage ?
For those of you who have n't done patent analysis before , it is not a quick
process .
It takes weeks of very careful work matching words to precise pieces of
code and functionality .
A quick read and " that sounds like fooWM " is
not what is needed .

IIRC , this is the same patent that SGI defended for it 's workspace
implementation way back in ' 95 .
If I recall correctly , it was never challenged
in court due to the difference in the way SGI had implemented it 's system and
the way that the patent had described the invention .
Once the differences were
noted , they just walked away .
There have to be some old SGI 'ers around that

A cynical mind would point out that prior art * MAY * be meaningless , depending on

The USPTO was
re -examining and had issued a non-formal rejection of NTP 's patents ( they had
not yet filed a formal rejection ) , and the judge * STILL * forced RIM to settle
because he was sick of the case .

From what I am reading this is only a patent problem within the US , and it
certainly is n't a patent problem in the EU .
Now , the EU and other non-US markets are far bigger that the US market , so in my
mind , the best thing that RedHat and Novell could do would be to pack their bags
and leave the US and then work to set up their future where their true markets
are .
Sure , this leaves Microsoft owning the US market with little if any competition ,
but if the US want to support Microsoft then they can own them and suffer the
consequences - the real future is elsewhere .

With due

Case closed .
This patent requires computers and screens .
The Supreme Court ruled that
software , in and of itself , was not a component of a patent in the recent MS v .
AT&T ( I think ) patent decision .
That should be a solid precedent for this case .
If Red Hat and Novell are
shipping software that is not considered a component of the invention , they are
not infringing .
Only their customers are by putting it on a computer , and
running it .

I 've been thinking about this , and as much as I dislike M$ , I have to admire the
chess - like strategy .
Unless someone can directly ( legally , criminally ) link M $
to the Patent Troll , they can't lose .
Here are the possibilities as I see them
:
1 ) Patent is Thrown Out for Obviousness -- Win M$ , Redhat and Novell spent money
defending it .
Roll out the next pawn .
2 ) RedHat & Novell win on Prior Art -- Win M$ , RedHat and Novell spent even
more money defending it .
Roll out the next pawn .
3 ) RedHat & Novell found guilty -- Win M$ , RedHat and Novell spent money
defending , lost , paid up .
FOSS Community gets a black eye , people rewrite the
code , roll out the next pawn .
4 ) RedHat & Novell fight based on Unpatentability of Software , and fail --
Win M$ , RedHat and Novell spent a lot of money , Software Patents Validated by
Supreme Court , M$ still has enough money to buy off patent trolls ad infintum .
Roll out the next pawn .
5 ) RedHat & Novell fight based on Unpatentability of Software , and win --
Win M$ , RedHat and Novell spent a lot of money , Software Patents invalidated
( which means no more Troll Headaches for M$ ) .
Roll out the next FUD idea .
It 's sort of like locking your enemies in a room together and putting a bunch of
knives in there , and only one can of spam to eat .
Eventually , one of them is
going to win , but either way it goes , you 've managed to get one or both of your
enemies badly injured , if not completely eliminated .
M$ 's worse scenario is
status quo maintained .

There is one way to squash this .

then you can't sue someone else that has made a product from it .
This would stop
the patent trolls .
They do n't have a revenue stream to protect from it so there
is no reason that they should be able to sue .

Surely not because SUSE is European and it
would be considered an attack by Microsoft on European IT companies ?
Heaven

Anyway , I can see that joinder is necessary in this case because of
the widespread use of Linux and its windowing systems around the world .
My
initial list is ,
IBM , HP , Dell , Sun , Apple , Google , Yahoo , the State of Texas , the Ministry of
Defence and the Department of Homeland Security .
If any of those are short of a
litigation penny or two I am sure those lovely FOSS folks would lend a lawyer .
I also have this nagging , worrying thought that the whole US legal system might
have to recuse itself from the case because of use of the litigated systems .
I was going to include SCOG for use of xwindows and windows managers in Unix ,
but that would defeat the purpose by automatically staying the case for six
months and that would never do .

... to see how Novell reacts .
According to their policy : http://www.novell.com/comp any / policies / patent /
" In the event of a patent claim against a Novell open source product , Novell would respond using the same measures generally used to defend proprietary software products accused of patent infringement .
Among other things , Novell would seek to address the claim by identifying prior art that could invalidate the patent ; demonstrating that the product does not infringe the patent ; redesigning the product to avoid infringement ; or pursuing a license with the patent owner .
I 've always kept the order of the alternatives as being relevant , meaning that pursuing a licence will only be used when all else have failed .
In other words , they first have to defend the community from the aggregator .
So this might be a good indication on Novells view of the Novell - MS deal .

I have skimmed through the patent .
I live and work in the UK and do not do
software development involving graphics or windowing , so I am unafeared .
Yes , this is a basic ancient patent involving placement and content of windows
in a graphical windowing system .
* Assuming * it is valid and defendable and worth money , which I personally find
very hard to believe , why are IP Innovation * not* going after an infringer with
a lot of money ?
Just to choose an example at random , how about Microsoft , the
largest purveyor of windowing systems with a graphical user interface ?
This is the question which needs to be asked loudly as soon as this story gets
reported by the usual victims ( News.com , VUnet , Enderle and so on and so on . )
Obviously the answer s to be found in the makeup of the board of directors , but
follow the money is a good rule .

There are two approaches that can be followed to defeat this , legal and
technical .
For those legally inclined and not associated with the firms being
sued Groklaw is the place to organize a coherent response strategy but all
should realize a legal response is NOT going to defeat the monsters but simply
hold them at bay for some duration of time .
Defeat can only come about by the
second strategy and that is technically .
Several days ago I posted that I had down loaded and installed OpenSuSE 10.3 in
one of my computer systems with the biggest problem encountered being that I
fell asleep during initial installation set up , it was late at night , and I woke
up to early in the morning , downloads were not finished but were finished by the
time I had finished coffee .
Anyone with the least technical ability can now
install OpenSuSE .
Fedora is slightly more difficult .
I would have had to had my
second coup of coffee which puts it in about the same realm as Mandriva and
Sabasian .
Sorry I have not tried every distribution so can not comment on
others .
From a desk top users point of view there is two potential hang up .
First there
are different and in many cases inferior , sometimes drastically inferior or none
at all user programs .
Apples Mac has the same issue .
Many business programs are
written for MS Windows only .
Second it is difficult to make Wine and its
derivatives work .
That is difficult for the non technical inclined .
For us non
geeks installation and operation of Wine is a ! @ # $ %^ well lets just keep it
polite and call it difficult .
If Wine is working correctly ( set up by some geek )
most Windows users would find it impossible to install a program under Wine and
have it work .
Hopeful this will shortly be corrected as this portion is really a
horrible experience .
For those of us that are neither legal or technical enough to be considered a
geek then all we can do is congratulate the geeks on the outstanding performance
hey have done .
The very fact that Microsoft is stooping to this level to
maintain their world wide toleration monopoly is verification of the excellent
quality of Linux .

With IBM , OIN , and the FSF all looking
closely , I can see no other outcome but victory for Redhat .
The prior art on
this one is already coming out , and some of it appears to be very strong , though
I guess that really depends on how you read the patent .
Someone grab the popcorn , lets get a seat .
One earlier poster talked about 300
and Sparta .
I have a feeling , this could be just as bloody come the end ( ask SCO
as their blood is currently flowing through the Bankruptcy court ) .

All this has me wondering if MS has settled anything with IP Innovation
recently .
I can see where they could cut a deal that MS would settle handsomely
if the next target was linux .
It also leaves me wondering where Apple fits in
that puzzle .
I do n't see them as a friend of Linux either .
The other interesting thing I se is that it does not involve any of MS's
precious IP .
Balmer must be clairvoyant .

Did anyone else notice the mis-spelling in the quote ?
Is that in the original ,
or did it somehow find its way into the article ?
If it 's in the original , it

This lawsuit is ridiculous .
It sounds more like they want to sue GNOME , KDE , or
one of the other 100 window managers that sit on top of X .
The last time I
checked , neither Red Hat or Novell were selling these , since they are open
source , included for free , and are not necessary parts of the
" products " that either sell .
In reality , Red Hat , Novell , or any of
the other distributions are just selling graphics , an open source programs
aggregation , and technical support .
One can easily run a complete Red Hat or
Novell " system " without even using the windowing program that is
included with it for free .

If you read this right , it means X - Windows violates this patent too .
and x-windows is OLD !
definitely pre-dates this patent , probably by at least a
decade .
Heck , I think DEC and so forth technically violate this from the late 70s !
They
had multiple workspaces back then .
An old DOS application called " Desqview " likely violates this patent
too , except , it too predates it ( more than likely ) .
Ohh , what about the Amiga ?
It 's desktop had this functionality too !
I 'm pretty sure Q - Nix had this functionality that predates this patent .
ohh , let 's go back to the 80s for something that predates this , something called
" GEOS " for the commodore 64
Apples OS will also predate this , as they had it .
I 'll bet the Atari had something like it ( though memory fails ) .
Oh , IBM definitely violates the patents from the mainframe days , except that too
predates the patent by decades .
Ah I miss the 3270 emulations ( not really )
So do the old ( pre-70s ) OS like " Sentry - 70 " violate this patent too ?
I
know the pdp -10's could give you multiple sessions , with graphics also from the
mid 70's .
Is prior art from the 70s good enough ?
or do we really need to go down the
" X- windows " road and IBM mainframe path ? [ Reply to This | # ]

RedHat makes money on service contracts , they NEVER transfer a license of the

Did n't Windows 3.1 have a 3rd party desktop add - on that would allow users to
switch to multiple desktops .
Seems like it was a very invasive piece of
software , but , as I recall it came out in 1987 or so .
That would be good prior
art .
Plus it would be good to use a Windows feature as prior art against the company

Was n't there a recent court ruling that merely using computers or electronics to
implement a known process did NOT constitute a new invention ?
If so , does n't
this greatly expand the scope of what might be considered prior art for this
patent ?
Here 's an example .
Many years ago , large advertisements were individually
hand - painted on billboards and other visible surfaces .
If I wanted such ads for
my products , I might very well hire a sign - painter and provide :
1 ) The locations and dimensions of surfaces I had obtained rights to use ( data
structures describing windows ) .
2) Pictures of my product(s ) and the text I wanted displayed with the pictures
( data structures describing objects to be displayed ) .
3 ) Descriptions and sketches of how I wanted the pictures and text arranged in
the ads ( data structures describing the mapping of objects into the window
display spaces ) .
Is n't this the essence of the patent that this lawsuit is all about ?

This question is probably too obvious to have any merit , but in the interest of

According to the link to the patent provided in the article , the assignee of the
patent is Xerox Corporation , not the company doing the suing ( I do n't want to

Build object off - screen Map object onto display buffer ( 1 ) with transform ( 1 ) Display buffer (1 ) Map object onto display buffer ( 2 ) with transform ( 2 ) Hide buffer ( 1 ) Display buffer (2 ) It 's one of the basics of all graphical game programming .

I 'm sure there are nuances in the patent claims that only a lawyer could love , but if it 's a nuance - it 's hardly innovative is it ?
As far as I can tell this is just combining basic graphical programing techniques with a ' desktop ' & claiming innovation .
I think Coliqueovision had a few games with split screens that might also be prior art , but it 's been way too long since I 've played any of them .

So MS has been building an army of patentbots .
And from the appearance of the
infiltration of MS personnel , Acacia / IP Innovation is a zombie in the MS
patentbot army . [ p ]
The targeting of Novell * and * RedHat by the zombie could
serve to legitimize the Acacia / IP claim like this : Microsoft , shocked , shocked
that its New Best Little Buddy Novell has apparently stolen figs from the Nice
Man 's tree , leans on Best Little Buddy to make nice with Acacia / IP .
( Not too
soon -- the more money drained from the coffers of FLOSS interests and the more
FUD generated , the better -- but not too long from now , because having a big Linux
entity admit IPP " wrongdoing " and / or settling with Acacia / IP would be
the biggest FUD emission of all . )
Any monies paid by Novell to Acacia / IP would
just be Microsoft paying itself to use its own IP , with the PR value of money
spent for such influence - laundering quite large . [ p ]
Watch for other little
IP - as - product companies the likes of Eolas to suddenly turn on FLOSS interests
as well ; Acacia / IP can't be the only zombie lined up in the MS patentbot army .

Actually , the patent quoted was applied for in 1987 .
It was granted in 1991 .
The earliest citation mentions the Xerox patent from 1984 .
The patent in question is basically a computer system with two desktops that has
links to the same data on each desktop and that can exchange information across
the desktops where the desktops are separate and distinct from each other .
It
actually looks to me to build on the 1984 patent ( which looks to me to be
multiple desktops ) .
I cant think of any prior art for the multiple desktops
patents , but the precursers of X might be able it be used as prior art for that
as well .

Split screen is not that a novel thing .
Convergent Technologies running their
CTOS operating system back then and perhaps before 1987 was using split screens
for their word processor called Write1 ( IIRC the name ) .
And I 'm sure the military in some of their communication / satellite comm systems
display units were using or could use split screens from the " big
iron " days .
That I know from first hand experience and it was IBM via their
360 mainframe and 3270 terminals were doing it as far back as the late 70s '
( AFAIK ) .
This company seems nothing more than patent trolls .
Odd they would pick on
Redhat and / or Novell , when Microsoft has a bank account worth billions more than
both these companies combined .
And I 'm , sure Microsoft makes use of the same
patent , if it is indeed valid .

According to reports , Apple was approached over the same patents and rapidly chose to settle .
It is my assumption Microsoft and its proxies wanted this done quickly , to aid in its FUD and allow the attack to start on the real targets , the business - oriented Linux distributors .
Apple was offered a really sweet deal , surely less than the legal fees of fighting .
It is my understanding ( IANAL ) that the Apple settlement establishes a reasonable ceiling on fair and equitable license fees on the patents .
I think it should be a priority to find out just how favourable a settlement Apple received .
Although it goes against the grain , if the answer was $ 0.10 a copy , perhaps the smart tactical move is to publicly offer a settlement on the same basis .
The message would be that companies built around open source are just as pragmatic as their proprietary competitors when presented with a reasonable settlement of patent claims .
A further message is that being sued for patent infringement is no big deal anyway .
Remember this patent expires shortly so it is not a long - term problem .
I confidently predict the offer to settle would be declined , but this would surely strengthen the position of Red Hat and Novell as the case moves forward .
I fear most in the FOSS community is going to treat any proposal other than global thermonuclear war as some kind of surrender or establishment of precedent .
I hope we can be smarter than that .

I 'm seeing all sorts of comments that complain that multiple desktops should affect this patent :
The usual IANAL disclaimers all apply here , and I am probably reading it wrong , but to me , it seems to only apply to a single item : Multiple views of the same object , POTENTIALLY , but not necessarily , on multiple displays or desktops .
Examples for this type of subject are things like : multiple editor windows ( e.g. old EMACS , or most modern editors )
Old AUTOCAD and even older CAD software that allowed multiple views of the same object from different angles Just about any MUD or MMORPG game ( e.g. Everquest , World of Warcraft / Second Life )
Possibly it applies to programs similar to MS NetMeeting - any software that allows multiple instances of the SAME desktop or program window .
I 'm remembering a CAD system I used in 1981 that had multiple workstations on a single machine , and could put use both stations to edit the same object .
Unfortunately , this did not use a raster display , but instead had a vector graphic persistent display ( i.e. the screen itself was the display memory , and making changes required a complete redraw , which took about 15 seconds ) with a limited number of non-persistent lines for cursors , selection frames , and moved objects .
I can't remember the name of the system , unfortunately , but some old SIGGRAPH docs might be useful here .
I 'm also getting the impression that this particular bullet ( even if it is a dum - dum round ) might be aimed at OpenOffice even more specifically than at linux in general .
Especially since I believe that some new Microsoft functionality is associated with multiple simultaneous ( remote ) editors of a single document on a server .

The Supreme Court has just agreed to look at a case that might be relevant .
Even if not then its still interesting .
The nature of the case is whether or not everybody in the supply chain from the manufacturer all the way down to the customer is liable for damages .
In the case of Novell and RedHat it seems to me that they are in the middle of the supply chain since they did n't write the software and are n't the final user .

Editors such as Xedit and the earlier ( internal to IBM ) Raleigh editor RED , in
the 1970s , allowed a split screen approach in which the same file could be
displayed in different ways ( e.g. columns 1 - 80 of each line in text mode in one
" Window " and columns 40 - 45 in hex followed by columns 1 - 20 in text
mode in another " Window " ) .

GUI 's go a long way back , and it should be fairly obvious
to invalidate some of all of the patent due to prior art .

PJ , can you post a copy of the file wrapper for this patent , please ?
File
wrappers can be big and expensive to obtain , but perhaps you can get one as a
PDF file from someone involved in the case , if you know someone who is willing
to give you that information .
It is foolhardy to try to attack this patent 's validity or even try to determine
how the claims are to be interpreted from the standpoint of an infringement
action without seeing the prosecution history in the file wrapper .
In particular , without examining the file wrapper , we do not know how the
examiner interpreted the patent claims to reach a conclusion as to their
validity , what , if anything , the applicant had to give up to allow the patent to
issue , what arguments the applicant had to make in order to overcome any
rejections the examiner may have made , and whether or not there are any unusual
events in the prosecution of the patent .

Thank You Pamela Jones for your continued groklaw reporting .
The history of the
IT movement will have lots of your website in it .
Microsoft , SCO , etc , is really a form of ' legal ' war not unlike terrorism .
Asymmetrical attacks , very expensive and unstable effects to society .
When are
we going to grok the truth , that the biggest threat to USA image , productivity ,
etc , is POGO 's statement , ... ourselves ?
The law in society is way past any good or common sense .
I 'm proud of those who
work to dismantle this system , its just like an OSS movement against Microsoft .
Punitive damages and other measures are not even enough to deter a Microsoft ,
which swallowed competition and essentially taxed the industry to death , until
the OSS revolution came .
What is needed , is the truth , of all the costs and
damages they bring to society , just like war and terrorism .
Perhaps society will understand than we must make things work , and better
society , otherwise we end up as Rome did .
USA , a lawless society , at war with itself , while the rest of the world laughs
and is preparing the leapfrog game .
Microsoft , etc , you are a clear and present danger to the USA stability .
IT and
data is what makes everthing work .
As Cosmo said in the movie Sneakers ,
" Its all about the Information . "
People are starting to grok the
truth , anticompetition destroys life and society .
The USA is in decline .
You
do the math .
Well , the information is out and is somewhat in the free and clear , the IT OSS
movement has started and only gotten stronger , as self preservation now becomes
important .
Piss off Microsoft .

Ethical considerations about user interface patents aside , this patent does n't
look all that bad for Redhat or Xorg .
The claims of the ' 412 Patent seem to be quite specific , as the patent seems to
have had to differentiate itself from a lot of prior art even back in 1987 .
The patent does n't claim the concept of workspaces .
It claims an outlandish ,
though specific implementation of that concept .
The independent claims , which I think are claims 1 , 21 , 24 , 38 , 44 , 49 , 53 , 56
as well as 59 all refer to two " display objects " , the second of which
is made to be " perceptible as the same tool as the first display
object " .
As " display objects " - in the way they are defined in that patent -
are what a workspace is made of , and they are required to be spatially distinct ,
the word in X11 terminology for them would be " windows " .
So , this patent claims that two windows , each visible on two different
workspaces , are made to look like one another , so that you mistake them to be
one and the same Window if you switch between workspaces .
More specifically , they are made to automatically look like one another , so you
do n't infringe if you just manually maximize two firefox instances ( I 'm not sure
about that ) .
This is not the way gnome or kde work .
Basically , if you have two workspaces ,
you have three groups of windows , one belonging to workspace 1 , one belonging to
workspace 2 and one belonging to all workspaces , which your panels and transient
windows belong to .
So , when switching from workspace 1 to workspace 2 , you hide windows belonging
to ws1 and unhide those belonging to ws2 , but do n't touch those remaining in
both workspaces .
Less popular window managers should be examined for infringement , though .
Perhaps some obscure , abandoned window - manager somewhere does something ,
anything , that resembles what is claimed in that patent .

Did Xerox at any time provide a patent license to X - windows based implementations or make any statements implying non-assertion of this patent against such implementations ?
As noted previously , the patent is related to an article published in 1986 .
D. Austin Henderson , Jr. and Stuart K. Card , " Rooms : the use of multiple virtual workspaces to reduce space contention in a window - based graphical user interface , " ACM Transactions on Graphics 5 ( 3 ) , July 1986 , pp. 211-243 .
I assume that the article does not count as prior art against the patent because of the US rule that authors have one year after publication to make a patent filing .
But I did a few searches to see if Xerox followed up in any way in possibly licensing or contributing technology to X - windows .
It turns out that there is a helpful online bibliography of Xerox PARC publications that includes the following item among others .
William C. Janssen .
" xRooms : A multiple virtual workspaces window manager for the X Window System . "
In Proceedings of the 1990 X Window System Technical Conference , Boston , MA , January 1990 .
So my question is , what is the extent of Xerox contribution of this technology to X - windows and under what licenses or implied patent grant was the contribution made ?

IANAL , but as I read the patent I notice that it seems to define an extremely
narrow set of requirements that must be met in order for something to be said to
implement the patent .
Or does infringement on any single claim count ?
If not , then we 're all in the clear .
A window in X , if it appears on multiple

Had this come prior to SCO 's attempt , they might have stood a chance .
However ,
anyone who reads the comments above mine will realize that the community 's

I suspect that open

Sprites have been used in computer graphics ( mostly video games ) since the 1970's .
MacroMedia 's Director was using sprites and similar concepts since 1985 .
These might not count as prior art since they are not per se GUIs controlling other tasks .
But they do a good job of showing how incredibly obvious the idea was .
When you create a Graphical User Interface , it is only natural to take pre-existing graphics art and tack on a UI component .
This patent could be the poster child for why software patents in general are bad .
The main reason we have a free software movement and not a free mechanisms movement is that software inherently builds upon prior art , layer upon layer , much more so than would ever be physically possible with mechanisms .
If people ( corporations ) are allowed to patent a single step in the process of software evolution , such as this case where a UI component is tacked on to the existing sprite framework , then almost no non-trivial piece of software will be free from multiple patent incumberances .
Which seems to be exactly the situation we face today .

The word ' computer ' does n't appear in the patent claims anywhere .
Is there the
possibility of non-digital prior art ?
For example , the ' display ' might be a ' book ' , ' workspaces ' might be ' pages ' ,
' workspace data structures ' might be sentences , words , letters ...
I tried to read the first claim with this in mind , but my head hurts from the
language they used .

Contrary to popular groklaw belief , patent trolls are not a MS invention .
In
fact , MS , Novell , Apple , etc. have been hit repeatedly by patent trolls .
So I view this as a validation of Red Hat as a company that has made enough
money selling Linux that they are worth trolling ... and that is validation for
Linux itself in an oddball way .
Dell might get a letter to stop selling Ubuntu on their PCs which could be
potentially more annoying than RH getting sued .

A rational question is to ask " why also Novell " ?
Yes , we all know
Novell and MS are buddies and all so this is a reason to think MS is not behind
this lawsuit .
Imho what 's going to happen is that Novell will be VERY collaborative and
willing to accept to pay royalties for this BS patent , the game will be make Red
Hat play alone .
The expected aftermath ( for MS - Novell ) would be to make Red Hat
look like a rogue company that does not respect IP .
And yes , thanks to Novell
the case will be much harder to solve for Red Hat than before , probably Novell
will rush in making a deal so there 's precedent ...
Laugh at the ridiculous theory all you want , I just hope Novell does not prove
me right on this one .
But if they do , then I hope nobody will argue to me whose
side Novell is playing for .

" X originated at MIT in 1984 .
The current protocol version , X11 , appeared
in September 1987 . "
Linux essentially uses the methods from X , protocol ,
etc .
So , either there was prior art ( X11 ) that invalidates the patent , or only
non-essential minor refinements to X11 could be a violation of the patent .
Clearly the only point to this lawsuit is harassment .

What this all says is that the GNU / Linux has grownup economically to the point
where people are going to take this seriously .
There are 100000001 theories about economics but it all boils down to value
perception and trust .
Linux it 's value was little mostly up till SCO started suing it by proxy against
certain Linux distributors and old clients .
This whole thing has caused a major overview by managers and clients that
started to ask them selfs " This Linux thing must be worth , why else would a
company like SCO wasting millions in litigation " .
Now managers are standing in 2 queues , one as buyers of service that come with
Linux and the other as litigators .
We will see what the future brings .

And Wanlass v. General Electric
Company are both very interesting cases on patent law and laches .
Link to article : Doctrine of Laches and Patent Infringement Litigation Basically , GE won because they made it quite clear that they were using Wanlass ' design while Fedders lost because they tried to be sneaky and hide it .
I.e. by being ballsy and basically telling Wanlass that they considered his patent invalid , and Wanlass taking > 6 years to take them to court , GE got a free ride .
I think that definitely would apply here .
Linux / Unix has hidden little or nothing , and the holder of this patent took too long to take anyone to court to enforce it .
Plus the fact is that it 's pretty much a worthless patent on something obvious and done with prior OSes at the time it was filed .

Hmmm I thought Linux was just an operating system .
Distros come bundled with a
lot of utilities , applications and extensions ( drivers , etc . )
A lot of which is
not Linux .
Novell , Red Hat , Suse , etc. all sell bundles of software -- a package , that
includes the OS , extensions and such .
You certainly do n't need any windowing
system to run a server although , it is nice .
TTY can do most of what 's needed
to manage a web server , firewall , or print server .
This suit seems to be like suing a library because a single book may have a
copyright infringement .
Would n't the proper approach be to sue the people who
supplied the package ?
X11 came out a long time ago and even the early window managers had the
capabilities being described here so I 'm sure there is prior art involved .
Patents need to list any other art that relates to them .
A patent for a car
would need to include the patents for tires , seats , engines , ...
So , I 'm confused .
Is n't this suit like suing a library because a publisher put
out a book that infringes a copyright ?
Should n't the suit go after the party
that violated a patent and not the distributor ?
If this is allowed , then even CompUSA or Fry 's or any other retailer could be
sued for selling the software and the user for installing it .
It would never
end .
You could sue the world and collect more than the national debt .
Of course , we 've seen weirder things happen with our legal system .
It 's a roll
of the dice for sure .
The only consistent thing about our system is its
inconsistency ;)

I can easily transfer documents and objects from one workspace to another as

which gave Windows multiple desktops .
It also did the same thing for DOS .

While running a search for the history of virtual desktops and such , I stumbled across this :

What is this ?
Why , it 's the same patent , filed by the same group at Xerox , only in 1995 .
So it appears that one patent was n't good enough ; they filed the SAME APPLICATION multiple times , and so have the patent multiple times .
Why in the world would you file the SAME PATENT TWICE ?
The best part , of course , is by 1995 the " Alternate implementations " section was out of date .
Actually , it was out of date in 1987 ( Amiga and MacOS both had something akin to multiple desktops ) , but by 1995 MOST UNIX systems had virtual desktops through X - Windows ... ---

OK , maybe I 'm an old fogy , or maybe I still have n't shaken off " the
Microsoft way " of doing things .
When I first tried linux , I had panic
attacks when all my icons and open apps occasionally disappeared .
In response
to my emails , people asked me if this happenned when I pulled the cursor over to
the edge .
Yes ?
But why ?
That 's when I found out about multiple desktops .
So my next question was
" HOW DO I TURN THIS ( expletive deleted ) " FEATURE " OFF ??? "
Well , it turns out that WM's ( Window Managers ) usually have a setting somewhere
for the number of desktops .
I set mine to 1 desktop , and all was well .
My open
programs no longer disappeared when I moved the cursor out of the way at the
edge of the screen .
Running with " only 1 desktop " is perfectly normal
for me .
So my question is ... can Redhat etal simply default their distros to 1 desktop

Ward and Smith is apparently a very small law firm in Longview , Texas with a seemingly limited scope of practice , curiously including patent infringement .
( I say " curiously " considering that the attorneys I have met who have been active in this area have all had sound technical backgrounds , the sorts of backgrounds which this firm does n't appear to possess at all . )
T. John Ward Jr. ( Johnny Ward ) signed the complaint filed with the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas Marshall Division as attorney for the plaintiff .
Please understand that I am not implying any unethical behavior on the part of the court or officers of the court , but there is another point which strikes me as unusual .
Namely , there is a T. John
Ward who is a judge in the same U.S. District Court in which this action is filed , though this is clearly not assigned to his docket .
Anyway , I have the impression that this little firm would not have the expertise and staying power to go through a long battle on its own .
For this reason , it will be interesting to watch who else might come to bat should Red Hat and / or Novell choose to engage in an aggressive defense .

I do n't have citations , but did n't a court recently rule that you cannot patent
doing a real - world thing that cannot be patented for reasons of obviousness , if
the only thing that is different is that now you are using modern electronics ?
Seriously , this patent is " having multiple workspaces " " on a
computer " .
I think any old movie with a guy who has more than one desk
would qualify as prior art .
Heck , is n't " having more than one workspace " the fundamental idea
behind the credenza ?
The little pull - out extra counter - thingy that desks have
had for centuries ?
The very existence of the " innovation " as an " analogy " or
" metaphor " ( e.g. multiple _desktops_ etc. ) points to the nature of the
alleged innovation as falling into the direct realm of something un-patentable
having been patented by adding " on a computer " to it .
The other clear indicator is that it lists a bunch of things that exist and then
a " for the purpose of " clause .
That is , you can't say that patenting
the building of a shelter for the purpose of keeping your bed dry is somehow
different than patenting a shelter built for the purpose of keeping your couch
dry .
The test that I would propose to the court for that a test for patentability is :
if you can cross out the things that the patent does NOT purport to invent , and
you are only left with conjunctions which combine ( a ) items performing their
existing and well understood purposes ( which is n't patentable as of 1957 or so
q.v. putting a conveyor belt next to a cash register ) ; or ( b ) statements of
purpose ( such as " to allow the user to organize " or any mention of
" client " and " server " which is techno - geek for deviding an
application into two parts to get them on separate machines , which is the
division of labor , which is not patentable ) ; or ( c ) words of metaphor ; or ( d )
" with a computer " or " on the internet " ; then you have
something that is _NOT_ an innovation .
Consider the one - click shopping .
The patent claims to allow the user to create a
relationship with the seller such that the seller knows how he will be paid and
how the item will be conveyed to the buyer once the buyer locates the item and
decides the price as offered is acceptable , and with this existing relationship
in place the user can perform a single understood action ( e.g. click one button
on the web page ) and the rest of the transaction will take place as understood .
Once you " cross out " all the normal non-innovative things ( establish a
relationship , make standard arrangements for payment , make standard arrangements
for delivery , select the item to be conveyed , understand and accept the price as
offered ) we are left with ( a ) the " single understood action " and ( b ) a
bunch of stuff about " pushing the button on the web page using a
computer . "
Well , for centuries we have had the well - to - do " dispatching a boy " to
get something from a vendor , Mr. Engles from his little house on the prairie
walking into Lars ' dry good , picking up an object , waving it and maybe even
saying aloud " put it on my tab " if Lars is n't talking to little Laura .
( interrupting them would be rude if they are talking 8 - ) . and so on .
In short ,
once we all know each other and the rules of our agreement , we often do
" the short version " of the buying transaction .
So having dispatched everything else , we are left with the browser , the
computer , the world wide web , and indeed the " browser button " ( none of
which we are not claiming to invent ) , we are left with the two more things the
test eliminates , the " obvious " " to make purchasing easier "
( e.g. the statement of purpose ) and " on the computer , on the
internet . "
we literally run out of words at that point .
See the problem with patenting software is _not_ that " software is
math " , it is that software , by definition , is " mere aggregation " .
That is , the software cannot make the computer do something beyond what it and
its aggregated components were designed to do .
CPUs compute .
Graphic
Subsystems draw .
Memory remembers .
Disks store .
All the rest is " for a
particular purpose " .
We propose using the disk store to store a database , or we propose using a
network to connect multiple machines .
The people who invented the hardware already got the patent for that function of
that device .
The software is just saying " yah , do that thing you do , you
know , that thing ... but like now " ( again and again ) .
If I have a sweing machine that can automatically embroider a huge number of
things at the turn of a control and the push of a button , nobody would accept my
attempt to patent " using a sewing machine automatically embroider a pretty
flower on a tee - shirt to make people happy . "
The sewing machine already
does all the work and has the cams and patterns for the flower .
Someone else
invented the tee - shirt .
someone else invented putting things on tee - shirts .
someone else invented thread .
All I am bringing to the table is the statement
of purpose " to make people happy " .
Yea , that 's all software is , mere aggregation , and all software patents are is
dressing up what the machine is designed to do behind a curtain of intent and
circumstance . [ Reply to This | # ]

This is Microsoft 's doing without a shadow of a doubt .
In this news pick there is a relevant quote
On Oct. 1 , Acacia Research announced that it had hired Brad Brunell as a senior VP .
Brunell joined the company from Microsoft , where he was previously the software maker 's general manager for intellectual - property licensing .
When will everyone else in the software industry realize that Microsoft is not to be trusted .
They will do anything to try and safeguard their monopoly on PC software .
Perhaps this will start to persuade the doubters that GPL V3 is the best license for all open source software if you want to help safeguard Linux against patents .
Ironically the fact that Microsoft have allowed Acacia ( and there must have been collusion ) to attack Novell as well as Red Hat might help to cement closer relationships between the two companies and perhaps now the senior management of Novell ( and possibly Linspire and Xandros ) might not start to see the error of their ways ( but I wo n't hold my breath ) .
What is needed ( perhaps ) is some sort of punitive patent attack by companies that use Linux against Microsoft perhaps against one of their flagship products ( perhaps a temporary injunction preventing sales of Vista , Office or SQL Server ) .
It would be poetic justice to see Microsoft in court trying to argue against software patents but obviously this is just speculation .
I do not think there is any real danger with this patent attack as there is so much ( obvious ) prior art but the very fact that Microsoft ( via their proxy ) are keeping the open source community busy in the courts is slowing down Linux adoption ( which is obviously what they want ) .
What do other people think ?

It might appear that Apple has licensed this patent in settlement of the suit brought against them earlier in the same District Court .

In this issue :
In Part I of this series , I examined the natural advantages of defense in military history .
I concluded that two advantages — the ability to shift forces and knowledge of the terrain — are underutilized in network security .
I concluded that network security based on hidden attack sensors and rapid response would be far more effective than firewalls , IDSs , and whatever the new new thing next new thing is .
In Part II , I want to look even more broadly at the military ’s notion of defense .
In war , there are three , and only three , types of defense : passive defense , active defense , and counterattack .
Passive defenses involve making yourself harder to attack .
Against an air assault , for example , this could mean building bunkers or hiding in caves , dispersing your forces , or covering yourself in camouflage .
All of these defenses have the same goal : reducing the effectiveness of the enemy ’s bombs .
The important thing to note is that while passive defenses make attacks less effective , they do nothing to the attackers themselves .
Active defenses are designed to take out the attacker .
Returning to the incoming aircraft example , an active attack could be anti-aircraft fire that shoots down the attacking aircraft in flight .
This is harder than passive defense , but can be much more effective .
Counterattack means turning the tables and attacking the attacker .
Against the air assault , it could involve attacking airfields , fuel depots , and ammunition storage facilities .
Note that the line between defense and offense can blur , as some counterattack targets are less clearly associated with a specific attack on a specific target and more geared toward denying the attacker the ability to wage war in general .
Warfare has taught us again and again that active defenses and counterattacks are far more effective than passive defenses .
Look at the Battle of Gettysburg in the American Civil War .
Look at the Battle of the Bulge in World War II .
Look at Leyte , Agincourt , and almost any piece of military history .
Even in the animal kingdom , teeth and claws are a better defense than a hard shell or fast legs .
On the Internet , most people think of computer security in terms of passive defenses only .
They believe that if they could only make their systems “ hard ” enough , they ’d be safe .
Security vendors reinforce this view , providing ever more intricate protection mechanisms for computers and networks .
Even the work I ’ve done , pointing out the limitations of prevention and extolling the virtues of detection and response , are still centered around passive defense .
Part I of this essay was similarly limited : the ability to shift forces and knowledge of the terrain are both primarily associated with passive defense .
If we ’re ever going to win the war against computer crime , we ’re going to have to increasingly think more in terms of active defenses , and even counterattacks .
We ’ve started to see some of this already .
Intrusion detection systems and honeypots provide alarms that can alert defenders of an attack in progress .
Managed Security Monitoring services can filter these alarms and provide expert response when a network is under attack .
Vigilant , adaptive , relentless , expert intelligent network defense is far more effective than static security products .
I said all of this in Part I of this essay .
But alarm systems , no matter how effective , are still primarily passive .
They allow a defender to better survive an attack in progress , but they do n’t put the attacker in danger .
Right now , the only counterattack we have is prosecution .
Putting criminals in jail is the best deterrent we have , and I am happy to see more of it .
But prosecution can only happen after the fact .
One can imagine active defenses and counterattacks , but they are mostly in the realm of science fiction .
What if , when an attacker broke into a network , his attack program were disabled ?
What if he could be sent a virus that destroys his computer ?
Or , at least , what if some third party collected an evidentiary chain that could prove his guilt in court ?
There are non-technical considerations as well .
In most countries , active defenses can be illegal .
Private citizens can’t mine their backyards or booby - trap their front doors .
In many countries , it is illegal for them to shoot a burglar breaking into their house .
Active defenses are reserved for wartime , where there are no rules , or for the police , who have a state - sponsored monopoly on violence .
I worry about the vigilante - style cyber - justice that could arise from this kind of defense , but it is certainly something we should be thinking about .
And it is definitely something that we should be researching .
Passive defense is far from useless , but is not the only form of defense we can use .
In many cases , simple active defenses such as monitoring are both more effective and more cost effective than adding more passive defenses .
“ Fortress computer center ” was a good model when every company had its own unconnected networks .
In today ’s world , where every network must be connected to the global network , it does n’t work as well .
If we are ever going to win the war against computer crime , we are going to have to emerge from our protective bunkers and actively engage the attacker .

Music , videos , books on the Internet !
Freely available to anyone without paying !
The entertainment industry sees services like Napster as the death of its business , and it ’s using every technical and legal means possible to prevail against them .
They want to implement widespread copy prevention of digital files , so that people can view or listen to content on their computer but ca n’t copy or distribute it .
Abstractly , it is an impossible task .
All entertainment media on the Internet ( like everything else on the Internet ) is just bits : ones and zeros .
Bits are inherently copyable , easily and repeatedly .
If you have a digital file — text , music , video , or whatever — you can make as many copies of that file as you want , do whatever you want with the copies .
This is a natural law of the digital world , and makes copying on the Internet different from copying Rolex watches or Louis Vuitton luggage .
What the entertainment industry is trying to do is to use technology to contradict that natural law .
They want a practical way to make copying hard enough to save their existing business .
But they are doomed to fail .
For these purposes , three kinds of people inhabit the Internet : average users , hackers , and professional pirates .
Any security measure will work against the average users , who are at the mercy of their software .
Hackers are more difficult to deter .
Fifteen years of software copy protection has taught us that , with enough motivation , any copy protection scheme — even those based on hardware — can be broken .
The professional pirate is even harder to deter ; this is someone willing to spend considerable money breaking copy protection , cloning manuals and anti-counterfeiting tags , even building production plants to mass - produce pirated products .
If he can make a profit selling the hacked software or stolen music , he will defeat the copy protection .
The entertainment industry knows all of this , and tries to build solutions that work against average users and most hackers .
This fails because of a second natural law of the digital world : the ability of software to encapsulate skill .
A safe that can keep out 99.9 % of all burglars works , because the safe will rarely encounter a burglar with enough skill .
But a copy protection scheme with similar characteristics will not , because that one - in - a - thousand hacker can encode his break into software and then distribute it .
Then anyone , even an average user , can download the software and use it to defeat the copy protection scheme .
This is what happened to the DVD industry ’s Content Scrambling System ( CSS ) .
This is how computer games with defeated copy protection get distributed .
The entertainment industry is responding in two ways .
First , it is trying to control the users ’ computers .
CSS is an encryption scheme , and protects DVDs by encrypting their contents .
Breaks do not have to target the encryption .
Since the software DVD player must decrypt the video stream in order to display it , the break attacked the video stream after decryption .
This is the Achilles ’ heel of all content protection schemes based on encryption : the display device must contain the decryption key in order to work .
The solution is to push the decryption out of the computer and into the video monitor and speakers .
To see how this idea helps , think of a dedicated entertainment console : a VCR , a Sega game machine , a CD player .
The user can not run software on his CD player .
Hence , a copy protection scheme built into the CD player is a lot harder to break .
The entertainment industry is trying to turn your computer into an Internet Entertainment Console , where they , not you , have control over your hardware and software .
The recently announced Copy Protection for Recordable Media has this as an end goal .
Unfortunately , this only makes breaking the scheme harder , not impossible .
The industry ’s second response is to enlist the legal system .
Legislation , such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) , made it illegal to reverse - engineer copy protection schemes .
Programs such as the one that broke CSS are illegal to write or distribute under the DMCA .
This is failing because of a third natural law of the digital world : the lack of political boundaries .
The DMCA is a U.S. law , and does not affect any of the hundreds of other countries on the Internet .
And while similar laws could be passed in many countries , they would never have the global coverage it needs to be successful .
More legal maneuvering is in the works .
The entertainment industry is now trying to pin liability on Internet service providers .
The next logical step is to require all digital content to be registered , and to make recording and playback equipment without embedded copy protection illegal .
All in an attempt to do the impossible : to make digital content uncopyable .
The end result will be failure .
All digital copy protection schemes can be broken , and once they are , the breaks will be distributed … law or no law .
Average users will be able to download these tools from Web sites that the laws have no jurisdiction over .
Pirated digital content will be generally available on the Web .
Everyone will have access .
The industry ’s only solution is to accept the inevitable .
Unrestricted distribution is a natural law of digital content , and those who figure out how to leverage that natural law will make money .
There are many ways to make money other than charging for a scarce commodity .
Radio and television are advertiser funded ; there is no attempt to charge people for each program they watch .
The BBC is funded by taxation .
Many art projects are publicly funded , or funded by patronage .
Stock data is free , but costs money if you want it immediately .
Open source software is given away , but users pay for manuals and tech support : charging for the relationship .
The Grateful Dead became a top - grossing band by allowing people to tape their concerts and give away recordings ; they charged for performances .
There are models based on subscription , government licensing , marketing tie-ins , and product placement .
Digital files cannot be made uncopyable , any more than water can be made not wet .
The entertainment industry ’s two - pronged offensive will have far - reaching effects — its enlistment of the legal system erodes fair use and necessitates increased surveillance , and its attempt to turn computers into an Internet Entertainment Platform destroys the very thing that makes computers so useful — but will fail in its intent .
The Internet is not the death of copyright , any more than radio and television were .
It ’s just different .
We need business models that respect the natural laws of the digital world instead of fighting them .
Similar sentiment about the death of the PC :

In many of my speeches , I talk about a “ Window of Vulnerability . ”
When a security vulnerability exists in a product and no one knows about it , there is very little danger .
But this state of security is fragile .
As soon as someone discovers the vulnerability , the danger increases .
If we ’re lucky , the discoverer is a good guy who does not exploit the vulnerability for personal gain .
Eventually word of the vulnerability gets out , and the danger increases .
This sounds just like the real world , but cyberspace has a crucial difference .
If I knew how to break into a certain kind of ATM , or hot - wire a certain make of car , or pick a certain model of lock , I could teach someone .
The person I taught would then know how , and he could teach others .
But it ’s a skill , and skills take time to teach .
Cyberspace is different because skill can be encapsulated into software .
If I knew how to break into Microsoft ’s IIS 5.0 , I could turn my knowledge into an exploit and distribute it on the net .
Then , hundreds of thousands of “ script kiddies ” — with no skill whatsoever — could use my exploit to break into IIS 5.0 .
The propagation characteristics of virtual vulnerabilities are very different than physical vulnerabilities .
We ’re seeing this happen right now with an IIS 5.0 vulnerability .
It was discovered by a company called eEye Digital Security , which was nice enough to warn Microsoft and give them time to create a patch .
Then , Microsoft and eEye announced both the vulnerability and the availability of a patch .
A few days later , someone wrote an exploit .
As the exploit made its way through the hacker community , and continues to do so , more and more IIS installations are being broken into .
The press regularly writes the story like this .
First , vulnerability discovered and we ’re all in danger .
Then , vulnerability patched and we ’re all safe again .
What they forget is that patches do n’t work unless they ’re installed .
And more and more often , people do n’t install patches .
I predict that years from now , Web sites will still be broken into because of this vulnerability .
So here ’s the million - dollar question :
Is eEye Digital Security part of the solution , or is it part of the problem ?
e Eye ’s own legal disclaimer implies that even they ’re not sure : “ In no event shall the author be liable for any damages whatsoever arising out of or in connection with the use or spread of this information . ”

Andrew Tanenbaum once quipped that the great thing about standards is that there are so many to choose from .
Despite numerous efforts over the years to develop comprehensive computer security standards , it ’s a goal that remains elusive at best .
It all started with the Orange Book .
As far back as 1985 , the U.S. government attempted to establish a general method for evaluating security requirements .
This resulted in the “ Orange Book , ” the colloquial name for the U.S. Department of Defense Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria .
The Orange Book gave computer manufacturers a way to measure the security of their systems and offered a method of classifying different levels of computer security .
The goal was to aid government procurement , but it also held the promise of benefiting the entire industry as well .
That never came to pass , primarily because certification testing was expensive and controlled by only a few labs , and the resulting designations were n’t well - suited to the civilian marketplace ’s needs .
There have been other efforts over the years to codify security , but they were unsuccessful .
Now , several industries are rallying around the Common Criteria , an ISO standard ( 15408 , version 2.1 ) that provides a catalog of security features such as confidentiality and authentication .
Companies and industries using this document are expected to include these concepts in a more specific “ protection profile , ” which is basically a statement of security requirements .
Then , individual products can be tested against that profile .
For example , a smart card could be tested against a protection profile with such attributes as resistance to cloning , security of protocols and protection against physical reverse engineering , and a firewall could have a different protection profile that includes attributes related to its security and functionality .
It ’s a great idea , and puts more meat on the bone than past efforts .
But do n’t expect it to work except in a few isolated areas .
The problem is that these standards are too general .
They wo n’t tell you how to configure your CheckPoint firewall , or what security settings to run on Windows 2000 .
It ’s not a shortcoming in the standards ; it ’s just not feasible to document an infinite number of scenarios .
Consider something truly quantitative : say , a configuration guide on the best way to secure Red Hat Linux 6.0 .
It could be an excellent standard , but it will probably be obsolete in a few weeks .
It will certainly have to be revised for version 6.1 .
And it ca n’t possibly help you configure Solaris version 3.2 , let alone Windows NT SP 4.0 .
On the other hand , some standards can be too specific , making it almost impossible to test a general system .
Remember when Windows NT received the Orange Book ’s C2 security rating ?
The rating was only good for a specific configuration of Windows , one unconnected to the network and without any removable media .
What about a rating for the overall security of Windows NT ?
Forget about it !
The bottom line is that while these standards can be very useful for certain applications , they are n’t useful gauging enterprise security in general .
The Common Criteria is a great document , and companies like Visa are putting a lot of effort to turn it into something that they can use for their own purposes .
The credit card company is currently using the document to specify security levels of hardware and software .
But that ’s only a special case ; no one else can take what Visa did and make use of it .
I have long joked that given any general security standard , I could design a product that 1 ) met the standard , and 2 ) was still insecure .
Given this truism , it ’s no wonder that these standards do n’t find much utility in the commercial world .
And it ’s no wonder why there are so many standards to choose from .

I am regularly asked what the average Internet user can do to ensure his security .
My first answer is usually “ Nothing ; you ’re screwed . ”
But it ’s really more complicated than that .
Against the government there ’s nothing you can do .
The power imbalance is just too great .
Even if you use the world ’s best encryption , the police can install a keyboard sniffer while you ’re out .
( If you ’re paranoid enough to sleep with your gun and laptop under your pillow , this article is not written for you . )
Even big corporations are difficult to defend against .
If they have your credit card number , for example , there ’s probably no way to make them forget it .
But there are some things you can do to increase your security on the Internet .
None of these are perfect ; none of these are foolproof .
If the secret police wants to target your data or your communications , none of these will stop them .
But they ’re all good network hygiene , and they ’ll make you a more difficult target than the computer next door .
1. Passwords .
You ca n’t memorize good enough passwords any more , so do n’t bother .
Create long random passwords , and write them down .
Store them in your wallet , or in a program like Password Safe .
Guard them as you would your cash .
Do n’t let Web browsers store passwords for you .
Do n’t transmit passwords ( or PINs ) in unencrypted e-mail and Web forms .
Assume that all PINs can be easily broken , and plan accordingly .
2. Antivirus software .
Use it .
Download and install the updates every two weeks , and whenever you read about a new virus in the media .
Some antivirus products automatically check for updates .
3. Personal firewall software .
Use it .
There ’s usually no reason to allow any incoming connections from anybody .
4. E-mail .
Delete spam without reading it .
Do n’t open , and immediately delete , messages with file attachments unless you know what they contain .
Do n’t open , and immediately delete , cartoons , videos , and similar “ good for a laugh ” files forwarded by your well - meaning friends .
Turn off HTML mail .
Do n’t use Outlook or Outlook Express .
If you must use Microsoft Office , enable macro virus protection ; in Office 2000 , turn the security level to “ high ” and do n’t trust any sources unless you have to .
If you ’re using Windows , turn off the “ hide file extensions for known file types ” option ; it lets Trojan horses masquerade as other types of files .
Uninstall the Windows Scripting
Host if you can get along without it .
If you can’t , at least change your file associations so that script files are n’t automatically sent to the Scripting Host if you double - click them .
5 . Web sites .

The same goes for palm computers ; people tend to keep even more personal data , including passwords and PINs , on them than on laptops .
10 . Encryption .
Install an e-mail and file encryptor ( like PGP ) .
Encrypting all your e-mail is unrealistic , but some mail is too sensitive to send in the clear .
Similarly , some files on your hard drive are too sensitive to leave unencrypted .
11 . General .
Turn off the computer when you ’re not using it , especially if you have an “ always on ” Internet connection .
If possible , do n’t use Microsoft Windows .
Honestly , this is hard work .
Even I ca n’t say that I diligently follow my own advice .
But I do mostly , and that ’s probably good enough .
And “ probably good enough ” is about the best you can do these days .

I was taken aback by your assertion that a burglar alarm works because “ the attacker does n’t know they ’re there . ”
After all , “ true victory consists of breaking the enemy ’s will without fighting . ”
The first line of defense is deterrence , the number one reason for installing a burglar alarm .
Security starts with making yourself a more difficult target .
Hence the “ Premises protected by ” stickers in windows and “ Alarm ” signs in front yards .
They encourage a potential attacker to pick another , less heavily defended , target .
In fact , the target may be completely undefended , protected only by signage purchased at a hardware or department store .
The Internet makes deterrence a little more dicey .
First off , the alarm is necessary , but the “ alarm ” sign is impractical .
It is a potential “ red cape ” waved at a hacking “ bull . ”
It may also tip the defender ’s hand by revealing his defenses .
In the physical realm there are a wide variety of systems and sensors to deploy to “ measure . ”
In the virtual , there are fewer , they are less easily understood , and harder to install and configure .
Once deterrence fails , detection becomes key .
In the physical world , the alarm system monitors a variety of metrics to evaluate defensive posture ( system armed / unarmed ) , readiness to respond ( sensor operational / deactivated ) , and violations of its sensors ( heat , motion , noise , moisture , or sensor loss ) .
The Internet alarm performs the same functions , and performs them in much the same way .
The next step in deterrence is the concept of “ unacceptable losses ” .
Here the two worlds both converge and diverge .
They converge on the definition of unacceptable losses .
On both the physical and logical plane unacceptable losses include arrest , conviction , fine , and / or imprisonment .
They diverge in the likelihood of suffering unacceptable losses .
As you note in _ Secrets and Lies_ , in physical security , the attacker must be physically present , rendering him not only detectable , but visible , and apprehend able .
The Internet removes that risk from the attacker , allowing him to strike remotely and in relative anonymity .
Once attacked , there are two phases to the defense : Repel and counterattack .
In the physical world , once an attacker is repelled , you follow up with counterattack .
Repelling the attack is accomplished by holding ground and buying time while the resources needed to stop the attack are marshalled and committed ( amateurs debate tactics , professional soldiers argue logistics ) .
Counterattack is accomplished by understanding the attacker ’s objective and the resources he has committed to the attack .
The defender manipulates these variables to expose vulnerabilities in the attacker ’s position which can be exploited .
These can weaken the enemy , forestall his attack , and potentially force his retreat .
If retreat can be forced , it can be followed up with pursuit , further weakening the attacker , deterring future aggression , and potentially reducing the attacker ’s resources below the level necessary to support another assault .
Unfortunately , counterattack and pursuit do not transfer well to the virtual battlefield .
About the only option is to repel .
The logical version of counterattack is limited to prosecution , which proves difficult when attacks occur across state and national boundaries .
Even when prosecution does occur , it is hampered by poor forensics , poor laws , and general ignorance within the court system ( See the judge in the Mittnick trial ) .
So what can you do to defend ?
Roll deterrence into your defense .
Monitor .
REVIEW THE LOGS !
Have an incident response plan .
Partner with law enforcement and a professional forensics team .
Be prepared to go public when attacked .
Aggressively prosecute intruders whenever possible .
Develop a reputation as a target to stay away from .

I would argue that there ’s a third issue , more important on the military side although it ’s not clear that there is any useful Internet analogy .
Another old military axiom : “ the attacker must vanquish ; the defender need only survive . ”
The defender ’s biggest advantage is that the attack has to make progress to succeed , and the defense does n’t .
This puts the attacker out in the open , moving forward , while the defender is stationary and under cover — less visible , better protected , and much more easily connected to communications and supply lines .
This shows , for example , in a traditional distinction between two types of hand grenades : offensive and defensive .
An offensive grenade has a rather limited lethal radius , because it ’s meant to be used by attackers , who may be on the move or behind poor cover ; in particular , it relies more on blast than on fragmentation .
A defensive grenade is designed to be lethal over the widest possible area , for use by people who are safely ensconced behind solid cover and may be ( locally ) badly outnumbered .
( I am not sure this distinction is still made nowadays , since even defensive forces now tend to emphasize mobility , but at one time it was taken quite seriously . )

I keep thinking about the apportionment of blame between the innocent defender and the guilty attacker .
Presumably , a bank robber would still be charged and found guilty even if one night the bank completely forgot to lock its doors or set its alarms .
But in that case I ’m sure the bank would be held partly responsible for the attack .
If someone takes a shot at me while I ’m ambling on the street , then he will always be guilty , even though I might have been negligent in walking on that particular street at that particular time .
It seems that in all cases there develops , over time and in accordance with local norms and experience , a state of equilibrium between the rate of crime and the level of defenses that are customarily implemented to thwart criminal acts .
Ideally , this state represents an optimal balance between the level of crime and the cost of relevant defensive measures .
A criminal who succeeds in spite of those defenses is more readily seen to be guilty , while a victim who falls short in implementing accepted levels of defense is less readily seen to be innocent .
But in no case does the victim ’s negligence excuse or justify the crime , nor does the criminal ’s ability to overcome your defenses excuse or justify their absence .
I think as far as the Internet is concerned , we are groping towards the defining equilibrium between crime and defense .
Right now , there is a set of protective measures whose omission would certainly represent culpability on the part of a defender , and there is a set of attacks whose commission would certainly represent a crime ( whether legally recognized or not ) on the part of the attacker .
But in between there is a grey area of defenses and attacks that lack categorical classification .
To date , though , I think we ’ve been too lenient on both complacent defenders and aggressive attackers .
That must and surely will change .
A starting point would be for the media to stop interviewing hackers as if they were just ordinary community - minded citizens .

Subject : e-mail filter idiocy
I have read your article and I can understand your annoyance at having your e-mail blocked for containing the unrelated words “ blow ” and “ job ” .
I admit the sample text censor scripts that we provided in MailMarshal version 3.3 have a couple of anomalies like this that would false trigger .
We have done a lot of work on our sample text censor scripts for the next version release to improve them and minimize false triggers .
MailMarshal is a tool to allow companies to apply corporate policy to their e-mail .
Technically MailMarshal did exactly what it was told to do , which was to block e-mails with the words blow and job in them .
In this case it was the script that was at fault , not the product .
Depending on how the company has set up our product to match their corporate guidelines , it is highly likely that the intended recipient of your e-mail also received a notification e-mail informing them that your e-mail did not arrive .
The e-mail you sent would have most likely been quarantined and could have been easily released by the administrator .
The line “ blow and job ” could have then been removed from the text censor script and the problem would never occur again .
If it is the organization ’s policy to block any e-mails which contain the words “ IL * VEYOU ” in the subject , then that is their choice and MailMarshal will allow them to enforce that policy .
We normally only suggest using a text censor script in this way when there is a virus alert and you would like implement some protection until you can get your antivirus product updated .
Otherwise we find scanning e-mails with an antivirus product and implementing rules that block e-mails which contain EXE or VBS attachments ( which normally have no business use for end users ) an effective protection against e-mail borne viruses .
As you well know , security is process , not product .
MailMarshal is a tool that allows you to apply that process .
It will only action what it has been told to do .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Firefighters quickly doused a two - alarm fire Wednesday in the historic Eisenhower Executive Office Building , which houses the vice president 's ceremonial offices and the majority of the White House staff .
Smoke billows from a window in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on Wednesday .
Firefighting crews used axes to break windows on the third floor of the ornate building shortly after the two - alarm blaze broke out after 9 a.m .
The fire started near the vice presidential offices , CNN's Kathleen Koch reported .
At its peak , heavy black smoke streamed from the building .
Watch smoke pouring from building »
Within an hour , smoke had stopped pouring from the building and was replaced by a fine mist of water , which the firefighters used to ventilate the building until they could get fans set up .
Vice President Dick Cheney 's working offices are in the West Wing of the White House , where he was at the time of the fire .
The White House is adjacent to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building .
See how close building is to the White House »
There were no reports of injuries from the blaze , which appeared to be confined to the third floor , said D.C. Fire Department spokesman Alan Etter .
Etter said the blaze appeared to have started in an electrical closet or a telephone bank .
" We have this under control , " he said , adding that the building was evacuated .
The Secret Service and a number of other agencies were on scene , as were 15 fire trucks .
The building houses nearly all of the White House staff , including White House speechwriters , White House communications , senior staff from the Office of Management and Budget and the National Security Council .
It was constructed between 1871 and 1888 and has been undergoing renovations .
Also called the Old Executive Office Building , the massive structure was originally built for the State , War and Navy Departments and is an example of the French Second Empire style of architecture , according to a government Web site .
The building is the site of a number of events , including ceremonial signings , news conferences and photo opportunities .
It was designed by Alfred Mullett , the supervising architect of the Treasury Department , and its exterior is composed of granite , slate and cast iron .

Chinese dumplings containing pesticide have sparked a food scare in Japan .
Ten people , including a mother and her four children , have become ill after eating meat dumplings that authorities believe contained pesticide .
The company that imported the dumplings has issued an immediate nationwide recall for all food produced by the same Chinese factory .
Police say they are investigating the possibility of criminal negligence .
Japan imported around $ 1 billion worth of food from China last year - this scare will heighten concerns about its safety .
Cheney seeks pretext for war as US reestablishes elite Air Force wing John Byrne
Published : Sunday September 23 , 2007
Print This Email This
The US Air Force has reestablished the elite fighting force which planned the 1991 Gulf War's air campaign and tasked them with " fighting the next war " as US - Iran tensions bloom , the London Sunday Times reports Sunday .
The news came on the heels of another Sunday report in Newsweek , which confirmed a quotation from a Cheney advisor who said that the Vice President " had been mulling the idea of pushing for limited Israeli missile strikes against the Iranian nuclear site at Natanz - and perhaps other sites - in order to provoke Tehran into lashing out . "
Such a strike would then give the US the ability to launch a strike in response .
Democratic foreign policy expert Steve Clemons , who said this week that President George W. Bush had ruled out a first - strike on Iran , voiced concern that the Cheney team might seek use an " accident " as a casus belli .
" I 'm not saying there wo n't be any war but nothing in Bush 's posture suggests he 's really with the Cheney gang yet , " Clemons told RAW STORY .
" But I do worry about the Cheney gang and the [ Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps ] / Ahmadinejad crowd in Iran trying to precipitate a spark that produces a very fast escalation that circumvents most of Bush 's national security decisionmaking structure -- and that kind of war is something we should worry about .
That 's what I think could happen . "
The London Sunday Times , meanwhile , reports that an elite Air Force unit called " Project Checkmate " was resurrected in June .
The unit reports directly to US Air Force chief Gen. Michael Moesely and " consists of 20 - 30 top air force officers and defence and cyberspace experts with ready access to the White House , the CIA and other intelligence agencies . "
" Detailed contingency planning for a possible attack on Iran has been carried out for more than two years by Centcom ( US central command ) , " says the Times 's Sarah Baxter .
" Checkmate 's job is to add a dash of brilliance to Air Force thinking by countering the military 's tendency to ' fight the last war ' and by providing innovative strategies for warfighting and assessing future needs for air , space and cyberwarfare . "
The group is led by Brigadier - General Lawrence Stutzriem , and assisted by a former Israeli military officer and cyberwarfare expert .
Strike force could target other states Bush faces strong opposition to military action among his own staff , Baxter says .
Clemons has said that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , White House chief of staff Josh Bolten and Defense Secretary Robert Gates all oppose a strike .
" None of them think it is a good idea , but they will do it if they are told to , " a ' senior defense source ' told the Times .
According to Baxter , Checkmate 's mission is n't limited to Iran , but rather " to provide planning inputs to warfighters that are strategically , operationally and tactically sound , logistically supportable and politically feasible . "
Targets might also include China or North Korea .
Checkmate was originally formed in the 1970s to counter Soviet threats but fell derelict in the 80s ; it was revived to plan for the first Gulf war .
On Saturday , Iran tested a longer - range missile in public for the first time and ran the gamut of anti-Israeli slogans in a military parade marking the start of Iran 's 1980 - 1988 war with Iraq .
The missile is said to put US bases and Israel within Tehran 's reach .
According to AP , " the parade was marked by a litany of slogans calling for " Death to America " and " Death to Israel . "
" The Iranian nation is ready to bring any oppressive power to its knees , " a slogan from supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei read .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad heads for New York today amid a storm of controversy and angry protests over his appearances at the United Nations and Columbia University .
The outspoken Iranian leader , who has openly called for the destruction of Israel and questioned the Holocaust , is due to speak at Columbia Monday , a day before addressing the UN General Assembly .
The trip comes at a low point in relations between Iran and the United States , which have not had formal diplomatic ties since revolutionary students stormed the US embassy in Tehran in 1979 .

Oh , the irony .
For anyone who thought that Hello Kitty was n’t first and foremost out to make a buck , the following newly released item should put that to rest .
Many of you know that there was a Hello Kitty vibrator that was made about 10 years back , but had been discontinued .
Most people are aware of the history of the shoulder massagers , but in case you are n’t , here are the basics :
It all started back in 1997 when Sanrio gave a license to Genyo Co. to make a number of different Hello Kitty products .
They produced all different types of products and one that was approved was a Hello Kitty shoulder massager .
This was sent out to gift shops , restaurant chains , and other knick - knack stores and was truly sold as a shoulder massager around Japan initially .
It was n’t long , however , that some people decided to use the shoulder massagers to massage other areas besides their shoulders .
The Hello Kitty shoulder massagers that were being sold at the store down the street began to show up in adult movies .
Soon they were also being sold in adult video shops and the sales of the product skyrocketed .
Eventually it made its way online to be sold internationally as a “ must have ” sex toy .
When Sanrio found out that the shoulder massager was being sold as a sex toy , they claimed to be disgusted , especially since the Sanrio name and Hello Kitty character were on it .
They immediately contacted Genyo Co. and asked them to stop .
The Hello Kitty vibrator had at this point gained cult status and was selling like hotcakes and Genyo Co. had no intention of letting a hugely profitable product be taken off the shelf just because people were using it to stimulate other parts than intended .
Sanrio tried to revoke Genyo ’s licensing rights , but Genyo refused saying they had a valid license that had been approved and had spent much money developing the product .
The fight between the two companies continued until Genyo Co. ’s top officials found themselves in tax trouble for some shady business dealings they were involved with .
This gave Sanrio the reason they needed to revoke the license and Sanrio took the “ shoulder massagers ” off the market .
The shoulder massagers that were still in outlets were soon bought up and sold as collector items sometimes reaching over $ 100 on eBay .
Since Sanrio was supposedly so disgusted and enraged by this “ shoulder massager , ” you can imagine my surprise when I received an email letting me know that they have revived it – selling it for just over $ 10 ( 1260 yen ) in the Sanrio Japanese online store :
Oh , but it gets even better .
Not satisfied to come out with only the same thing they had in the past , it now is also available in black :
This development of the “ shoulder massager ” being sold again is especially disturbing to all those that live in Hello Kitty Hell .
At the end of the day , that is the last place you want to see Hello Kitty no matter how much pleasure the Hello Kitty fanatic claims that Hello Kitty brings .
If this is the type of news the holiday season is going to be bringing me , it ’s definitely going to be the most Hello Kitty Hellish one ever …
Thanks to Noa who really should be given some unspeakable torture treatment for even having the thought that letting my wife know these existed was a good idea …
Update :
It appears they are available in red and lavender as well :

The boyfriend of Jamie Lynn Spears could face statutory rape charges after getting Britney Spears ' sister pregnant at 16 , it has been revealed .
And Casey Aldridge , 19 , could face up to 10 years if convicted , possibly with hard labour .
Scroll down for more ...
Fox News reports that if the baby was conceived in Spears ' home state of Louisiana , the act could technically be considered " felony carnal knowledge of a juvenile . "
Louisiana law defines this unlawful carnal knowledge as " sexual intercourse with consent between someone age 19 or older and someone between age 12 and 17 . "
In Louisiana a person can only legally consent to sex at age 17 .
If aged 15 or 16 , the other person involved must be no more than two years older for the act to be considered legal .
But Aldridge would n't fare much better if the " carnal " act happened in California , where Spears lives while on the set of her Nickelodeon TV show Zoey 101 .
The Californian Penal Code states that any person who engages in an act of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor under 18 who is not more than three years younger than the perpetrator , is guilty of a misdemeanour and faces up to one year in a county jail .
But Californian criminal defence attorney Jim Hammer says : " If Aldridge is actually more than three years older he could be up for a felony , which carries a maximum three years in prison . ”
Meanwhile , Jamie Lynn says she believes she 'll be a good mother : " I love babies , and I have my nephews that I love .
" I have a great mom and she has raised three kids , so if I take lessons from her , I think I 'll be great . "
But the executions of three men in less than three hours concentrated all the pain and other feelings that emanate from such powerful events .
Outside the Governor 's mansion , in Little Rock , Ark. , 100 miles away , a few dozen people stood in the freezing rain , to plead for compassion .
Like those on the other side of this issue , they quoted a Bible to make their arguments .
'' Forgive them , Father ; they do n't know what they are doing , '' said Sister Joan Pytlik , a Roman Catholic nun in Little Rock .
And , in a room near , but out of sight of , the execution chamber , a small group of people whose lives were unalterably changed by the killers huddled together .
Arkansas does not allow the relatives of victims , or of the condemned , to witness the execution .
But some of the victims ' relatives just wanted to be as close as possible , as the thing was being done .
'' They took the shirt off my dad 's back before they killed him , '' said Virginia Hamilton , whose father , a small - town marshal who made $ 100 a week for breaking up fights and giving drunk teen - agers a strong talking to , was murdered by Mr. Denton and Mr. Ruiz when he went to help them with a flat tire .
It took her father away from her when she was 14 , and ruined her mother 's life , she said .
'' Yeah , '' Mrs. Hamilton said , '' I hate them . ''
Others , like Mrs. Jester , waited for word by phone .
Angela Smith Cunningham , who was just 11 on July 19 , 1988 , the day Kirt Wainwright shot her mother behind the counter of a convenience store in Hope , Ark. , wanted to know one thing , as the execution neared : would he beg for his life , '' like my mother did . ''
As the hours ground down to 7 P.M. , the start of the first execution , as the inmates sat alone or with their counselors in their '' quiet cells , '' the rain and cold combined to cover the barren trees around the prison in a sheen of glittering ice .
Back in Little Rock , as the first man , Mr. Denton , began the short walk to the chamber , protesters lit a single candle .
Behold --
The world - famous Baxter Building !
One of the great things about the Fantastic Four comics was all the super - nutty Kirby gizmos and gadgets .
Crazy stuff -- like James
Bond gear on steroids and acid !
And talk about high maintenance ... the team needed enough space for a Fantasti-car , a Pogo Plane , a Fantasti - Copter , a Private Passenger ICBM , an Observatory , an entrance to the negative zone , a computer room , a chemical lab , a photo analysis lab , a projection room , a gymnasium , trophy room and living quarters ( just to name a few ) .
Naturally , a Super - team with this much baggage needed an exceptional uh ... " secret " base of operations .
Where better , than the middle of Manhattan Island in NYC ?
(... yeah -- good luck with that telescope , Stretcho . )
Specifically floors 30 through 35 on the top of the Baxter Building .
Within the confines of these 5 floors lay a virtual crime - fightin ' and weird experimentin ' complex the likes of which the world had never seen before !
So large in scope , that it prompted several celebrated cutaway views of of the Building 's insides -- presumably to help the reader figure out exactly where all the action was taking place .
I 'd thought about doing a post like this last summer ... but when I picked up issue # 1 of Marvel 's new Mythos Fantastic
Four book last week and saw that the title artist Paolo Rivera had just done an updated cutaway , I knew the time was right .
So , here -- for the first time I 'm aware of -- are ALL cutaways of the Baxter building to date !
... featuring insane amounts of Photoshop restoration on the old versions by yours truly so they can be blown up big and still look great .
All cleaned up from my own issues of the original books they appeared in , with the original ( minus the yellowing ) color schemes .
Enjoy !
While the F.F. had already defeated the Mole Man and the Skrulls ,
it was n't until issue # 3 that we got to see some Fantasti- car ( known these days more commonly as the Flyin ' Bathtub ) and found out the secrets of the " Fantastic Four 's Skyscraper Hide - Out ! "
This was the first time the Baxter Building and it's contents -- at least the top two floors of it were diagrammed .
It was n't long though - - just three issues in fact -- before Jack was at it again .
From issue # 6 , here 's a slightly more complete look at the top 5 floors of " the world 's greatest office building " .
Here 's Jack 's third and final take ( to my knowledge ) on the FF 's HQ innards ...
As it originally appeared in Fantastic Four Annual # 3 ( this version was also printed in Black and White in the back inside cover of the 1975 over - sized Fantastic Four Treasury .
I ran it too , back up a the top ...
And though on that printing there 's a blurb with an allusion made to the then - current book 's team of Len Wein and Rich Buckler doing an updated cutaway soon , I do n't recall them actually getting around to it .
A decade and over a hundred issues passed before anyone would attempt a new Baxter bldg pin-up , but after the big Gonzo blowout with Dr. Doom in issue # 200 , Keith Pollard and Longtime - inker Joe Sinnott were ready to tackle the project .
Here 's their version from Fantastic Four issue 201 , December 1978 .
It would be 48 issues before anyone else would tackle the 5 story x-ray .
Then , when John Byrne took over the book in 1981 , he had Terrax destroy the the top 2 floors of the tower ( and f- up the lower ones ) .
The FF had to rebuild all 5 floors of their HQ -- and once it was completed it was prime time to address the new changes .
( Besides , more than anybody else outside of Stan and Jack , John got the FF and brought back a lot of what made the book fun to begin with -- that is , before Shooter ruined it all with the Secret Wars books . )
Here , from # 249 is that cutaway .
And the latest version ... Paolo Rivera 's aforementioned new version .
Nice to see see Paolo 's rife and realistic painterly approach to the material .
The rest of the book looks like this too , so if you have n't picked it up you probably oughta .
HAPPY HOLIDAYS !
And a big tip of the hat goes out to Marvel Comics Group , Stan Lee and Jack Kirby , Keith Pollard , Joltin ' Joe Sinnott , John Byrne and Paolo Rivera
Using a Taser to control agitated suspects in police custody is standard operating procedure for many law enforcement agencies .
In some circles , however , the idea that using a Taser could lead to a suspect 's death has caused controversy .
Now , the final results of a study conducted by emergency medicine physicians at the University of California , San Diego ( UCSD ) Medical Center showed no lasting effects of the Taser on healthy test subjects .
" Evaluating in - custody deaths following use of a Taser is a process that requires looking at the totality of the event .
It is like putting a puzzle together .
The data from this study helped shape another piece of the puzzle by looking at the physiological effects of a single Taser activation in human subjects , " said study director Gary Vilke , M.D. , professor of clinical medicine and director of Clinical Research for Emergency Medicine at UC San Diego .
Vilke presented his findings at the 2007 Society for Academic Emergency Medicine ( SAEM ) Annual Meeting , May 16 - 19 , 2007 , Chicago , IL .
Taser subdues a person by delivering an electrical current that interferes with the body 's neuromuscular system , temporarily incapacitating the recipient .
" I have been Tazed , " said Vilke .
" The experience is painful while it 's happening but afterward , you only feel sore , like you might after a tough workout .
Our goal was to find out how , in the absence of alcohol , drugs or other stimulants , humans are affected physiologically . "
Vilke monitored the reactions of 32 healthy volunteers from the San Diego County Sheriff 's Department who agreed to receive a single , five - second exposure from a Taser X26 , the model reportedly used by more than 30 percent of police agencies in the United States .
The standard issue law enforcement Taser is set to administer an electric shock in five - second intervals .
Study coordinators measured cardiovascular and blood parameters before the exposure and for one hour after the exposure .
Blood pressure and heart rate as well as calcium , sodium , potassium , bicarbonate and lactate levels , and blood pH were measured .
Systolic blood pressure decreased after the Taser , likely due to a heightened anxiety before the test .
Other measures changed slightly , but there were no clinically significant or lasting changes in the subjects .
This study was funded by the National Institute of Justice .
Phase two of the two - year study is already underway , testing the affects of Taser use on subjects who are under additional stress .
" In this phase , the sheriff department volunteers will be exercising to raise their heart rates prior to being exposed to the Taser .
Most suspects are being pursued : running , driving fast , excited in some way .
This study will monitor participant vital signs while looking at that piece of the puzzle , " said Vilke .
The Voyager 2 spacecraft 's Plasma Science instrument , developed at MIT in the 1970s , has turned up surprising revelations about the boundary zone that marks the edge of the sun 's influence in space .
The unexpected findings emerged in the last few weeks as the spacecraft traversed the termination shockwave formed when the flow of particles constantly streaming out from the sun -- the solar wind -- slams into the surrounding thin gas that fills the space between stars .
The first surprise is that there is an unexpectedly strong magnetic field in that surrounding interstellar region , generated by currents in that incredibly tenuous gas .
This magnetic field is squashing the bubble of outflowing gas from the sun , distorting it from the uniform spherical shape space physicists had expected to find .
A second surprise also emerged from Voyager 2's passage through the solar system 's outer edge : Just outside that boundary the temperature , although hotter than inside , was ten times cooler than expected .
Theorists had to scramble to come up with an explanation for the unanticipated chilling effect .
" It 's a different kind of shockwave than we 've seen anywhere else , " says John Richardson , principal investigator for the Plasma Physics instrument and a Principal Research Scientist at MIT 's Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Science .
The unexpected coolness , theorists now think , is caused by energy going into particles that are hotter than those that can be measured by the MIT plasma instrument .
Richardson will be taking part in a press conference reporting the new findings on Monday , Dec. 10 , at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco .

The Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft were designed primarily to study the planets Jupiter and Saturn and their moons .
After launch , Voyager 2's path was adjusted to take it past Uranus and Neptune as well .
Although the craft were only built for a five - year mission , both are still working well three decades later .
" We were incredibly lucky to have it last 30 years , " says John Belcher , professor of physics at MIT and former principal investigator for the Voyager Plasma Science instrument .
The craft is now expected to keep working until about 2020 , and still has important scientific objectives ahead .
It is now passing through a boundary zone called the heliosheath , a region where the solar wind interacts with the surrounding interstellar medium .
But sometime in the next decade , it will cross a final edge , called the heliopause , where the sun 's outflow of particles ends .
At that point , it will be able to measure characteristics of the interstellar medium , for the first time , in a region unaffected by the solar wind and the sun 's magnetism .
Although Voyager 1 had already crossed the termination shockwave three years ago , the MIT Plasma Science instrument on that spacecraft had stopped working , so the spacecraft could only indirectly detect the end of the sun 's influence .
But with Voyager 2 , the Plasma Science instrument not only detected the boundary , making detailed measurements of the solar wind 's temperature , speed and density as the spacecraft crossed through it , but it actually encountered the shockwave repeatedly .
Because the outflow of the solar wind varies with changes in the sun 's activity level , building up during large solar flares and quieting during lulls in sunspot activity , the boundary itself pulsates in and out .
These pulsations can wash across the craft multiple times , just as a boat landing onshore may cross the ocean 's edge multiple times as waves crash in and then recede .
While Voyager 1 apparently made a single crossing , Voyager 2 apparently crossed the boundary five times , producing a wealth of new data .
It 's even possible that if there are large variations in that solar outflow , the shock layer " could push past Voyager again , " says Richardson .
" That would give us some idea of how elastic the shock is " -- that is , how far out these pulsations may stretch .
Until and unless such detections are made , " we only have models " of how great such variations might be , he says .
Voyager 2 is now 7.879 billion miles from Earth , traveling away at almost 35,000 miles per hour .
Voyager 1 is 9.797 billion miles away , going more than 38,000 mph .
The Plasma Science instrument was developed by the late Professor Herbert Bridge and Alan Lazarus , a senior research scientist in the Department of Physics and MIT 's Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Science .
NASA has sponsored the work .
Right : The Castles of North Wales and the Welsh Wars of Independence
Edward I 's fearsome Iron ring of colossal fortresses represents Europe 's most ambitious and concentrated medieval building project , designed to prevent the recurrence of two massively expensive military campaigns .
After Edward 's first successful campaign in 1277 , he was able to pin down his adversary Llywelyn ap Gruffydd ( " The Last " ) in Snowdonia and on Anglesey .
This gave him room and time enough to build the now largely ruined castles at Flint , Rhuddlan , Builth Wells and Aberystwyth , as well as to commandeer and upgrade Welsh castles , Edward 's first attempt at subjugation .
Llywelyn's second uprising , in 1282 , was also ultimately unsuccessful , and Edward , determined not to have to fight a third time for the same land , set about extending his ring of fortifications in an immensely costly display of English might .
Together with the Treaty of Rhuddlan in 1284 , this saw the Welsh resistance effectively crushed .
The castles at Harlech , Caernarfon and Conwy , through nearly contemporary , display a unique progression towards the later , highly evolved concentric design of Beaumaris .
All this second batch , including the town walls of Caernarfon and Conwy , were the work of the master military architect of his age , James of St. George d'Esperanche , whose work is now recognized with UN World Heritage Site status .
Each of the castles was integrated with a bastide town , an idea borrowed from Gascony in southwest France , where Edward I was duke - the town and castle mutually reliant on each other for protection and trade .
The bastides were always populated with English settlers , the Welsh permitted to enter the town during the day but not to trade and certainly not carrying arms .
It was n't until the 18th century that the Welsh would have towns they could truly call their own .
The Edwardian castles of North Wales were nearing completion when the revolt of 1294 - 5 broke out .
Their garrisons were depleted by the king 's expedition to Gascony .
Several , including Cardigan and Caernarfon , were besieged , but the English control of the sea restricted the spread of the revolt .
Castles held out as long as provisions could be brought by ship .
Aberystwyth , Conwy and perhaps Criccieth and Harlech were provisioned from Bristol and Ireland .
During the winter - not an unusual time for campaigning - the king 's forces pressed into Gwynedd .
Caernarfon was relieved , and in the spring of 1295 work began on the last of Edward 's castles , Beaumaris .
Edward experienced the greatest difficulty in paying for his building program .
Its true monetary cost can not be known .
Over 12 years he spent L60,000 ( about L33 million in today 's terms ) , more than 10 times his annual income , on building castles and walled towns at Conwy , Caernarfon , Beaumaris and the refurbishment of Llywelyn's castle at Criccieth .
This integrated program - each borough defended by its castle , and each castle accessible by sea - has left Wales with a legacy of medieval military architecture of truly international importance .

Samina Malik , who burst into tears on hearing the verdict , wrote poems entitled How To Behead and The Living Martyrs and stocked a " library " of documents useful to terrorists .
On the social networking site Hi5 she listed her interests as : " Helping the mujaheddin in any way which I can ... I am well known as lyrical terrorist . "
The jury at the Old Bailey found Malik guilty by a majority of 10 to one of possessing records likely to be used for terrorism .
Judge Peter Beaumont , the Recorder of London , bailed Malik on " house arrest " and ordered reports into her family background ahead of the sentencing on December 6 , warning her that jail remained a possibility .
" You have been , in many respects , a complete enigma to me , " he told her .
Malik , who worked at WH Smith at the airport , was arrested in October last year .
When her bedroom was searched police found a ringbinder full of documents as well as a bracelet bearing the word " jihad " .
There was also a sticker on a mirror inside the door , bearing the words " lyrical terrorist " .
In one handwritten document found by police , she wrote : " I want to have the death of a shaheed [ martyr ] ...
I want the opportunity to take part in the blessed sacred duty of jihad . "
Also found were publications from an Islamist extremist group called Followers of Ahl us-Sunnah Wal - Jammaa 'ah , linked to another group , The Saved Sect , and to the extremist cleric Sheikh Omar Bakri .
In a box file in the family lounge was a printed version of the " declaration of war " by Osama bin Laden .
One of Malik 's poems , entitled The Living Martyrs , said : " Let us make Jihad / Move to the front line / To chop chop head of kuffar swine " .
A second poem was called How to Behead .
" It 's not as messy or as hard as some may think /
It 's all about the flow of the wrist , " it read .
The Mujaheddin Poisoner 's Handbook , Encyclopaedia Jihad , How To Win In Hand To Hand Combat , and How To Make Bombs and Sniper Manual were found on her computer .
The court heard Malik joined an extremist organisation called Jihad Way , set up explicitly to disseminate terrorist propaganda and support for al Qaida .
Jonathan Sharp , prosecuting , said she was an " unlikely " but " committed " Islamic extremist : " She had a library of material that she had collected for terrorist purposes .
That collection would be extremely useful for someone planning terrorist activity . "
But Malik , of Townsend Road , Southall , west London , told the jury : " I am not a terrorist . "
She claimed to have used the nickname " lyrical terrorist " because she thought it was " cool " .
Malik was convicted of possessing records likely to be useful in terrorism under the Terrorism Act 2000 .
She was earlier cleared by a jury of a separate count of possessing an article for terrorism .
“ There is a lot of confusion up there , ” Jim Nussle , director of the Office of Management and Budget , said of Congress .
“ We are not sure how to deal with them . ”
As a first step , Democrats this week chose to combine the nearly $ 151 billion measure that pays for a wide variety of health and labor programs — and which the president has threatened to veto — with a very popular $ 64 billion veterans measure that the president has said he will sign even though it exceeds his limit by $ 4 billion .
The health bill exceeds the president ’s spending allotment by about $ 10 billion — almost half of the overall amount at issue .
But some of those increases are designated for highly popular initiatives such as National Institutes of Health research and federally funded community health centers .
Those centers , in line for an added $ 225 million to open new facilities and expand existing ones , have been hailed for delivering economical care to the nation ’s uninsured , with President Bush calling them a “ really good use of taxpayers money . ”
Republicans have objected to merging the health and veterans measures and Senate Republicans said today that they would use a new procedural tool to try to split them , forcing Democrats to send Mr. Bush the health bill on its own .
“ There is no reason to put the veterans and our active - duty military and all of their needs that would be met immediately into a bill that has nothing to do with this issue and which the president has given the signal he is going to veto , ” said Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison , Republican of Texas .
Other Republicans say a focus on the overall $ 22 billion divide is misleading , because the increases , when extended over five years , would amount to $ 204 billion .
“ That throws off the effort to balance the budget and puts pressure on the need to raise taxes , ” said Representative Paul D. Ryan , Republican of Wisconsin .
Republicans also intend to highlight earmarks — the special projects added by lawmakers — to show the bills contain wasteful spending pushed by powerful patrons in Congress .
Democrats contend that Republicans spearheaded the expansion of earmarks when they controlled Congress and that such projects are sought by both sides .
They point to a Congressional Research Service report that shows the Republican - led Congress regularly exceeded the Bush administration ’s spending limits when emergency and war money was factored in and that the president never balked .
And they note that Republicans routinely merged spending bills when they were in charge .
All Linda Katz had to do was step outside of her house to make thousands on the Internet .
Now the Midwestern entrepreneur is building a business selling a piece of the old west online : tumbleweeds .
Linda started her online business , the Prairie Tumbleweed Farm , as a joke .
It was 1994 and she wanted to teach herself how to design a website .
Since she lived on the prairie in southwest Kansas , where rolling tumbleweeds are sometimes the only dynamic feature of an endless flat horizon , she invented a farm that sold tumbleweeds , listing prices at $ 15 for a small one , $ 20 for a medium and $ 25 for large .
Lucky for her , some people did n’t get the joke .
People emailed the site wanting to buy them .
But even then Linda doubted she would be able to spin this straw into gold .
“ When I got an order I was just amazed , ” she says , sitting on the porch of her home in Garden City , Kansas .
“ And each order I got , I thought it would probably be the last order .
I remember thinking they would probably get them and send them back immediately as soon as they find out what they are . ”
But that did n't happen .
In fact , the orders just kept coming -- an average of 15 per week .
Though she ’s coy about her annual income from tumbleweed wrangling , she says it is over $ 40,000 a year .
Not bad for a bunch of dead , dried - up weeds .
Who buys them ?
Well , says Katz , rocket scientists , for one .
NASA purchased tumbleweeds when they were designing their Mars Tumbleweed rover .
“ And if you go to their site on the NASA site to the tumbleweed rover , and you go to their links , they say that they only buy their tumbleweeds from Prairie Tumbleweed Farm , ” Katz says proudly .
Hollywood has also come calling .
Katz ’s tumbleweeds have appeared in films like Johnny Depp ’s “ Neverland . ”
And she has supplied tumbleweeds to the big purple dinosaur kid ’s show , “ Barney . ”
Katz says people usually use her tumbleweeds to recreate the look and feel of the old west for theme parties .
But some customers tell her they buy tumbleweeds to remind them of the home on the prairie they left long ago .

Credit card debt is easy to get into and difficult to get out of .
Credit cards make it easy to spend more than you have ; purchase items you do n’t really need , and can give you a false sense of financial security .
Many of us carry credit cards in fact according to the Survey of Consumer Payment Choice , 609.8 million credit cards are held byU.S. consumers .
That ’s a lot of credit cards that can add up to a lot of debt !
The average credit card debt per US household with credit card debt is $ 15,799 .
That means many of us are carrying the baggage of credit card debt .
Do n’t be a statistic make a difference in the way you use your cards and your credit card debt today .
Here are 10 ways to help you say goodbye to your credit card debt .
Spend less you earn .
Basic , yet powerful advice , “ If you ca n’t afford to pay for it now , do n’t buy it . ”
Live within your means and use those saved dollars to pay down your credit cards .
Pay more than the minimum on your credit cards .
Start with the highest interest rate card first — send as much as you can beyond the minimum payment , while still fulfilling your other financial obligations .
Understand how your credit card ’s interest rates and minimum monthly payments affect your bottom line using this credit card debt calculator .
Boost your income .
Can you juggle two jobs or add part - time work to your career ?
Consider selling items you no longer need on Craigslist or eBay .
Maybe even turn your hobbies and interests into income as a music instructor , writing tutor , handyman , etc .
Choose debit over credit .
80 % of consumers own a debit card .
If you are one of them choose debit over credit card–this forces you to buy only what you can afford based on the balance in your bank account .
If the money is not there , you ca n’t spend it .
This also prevents the risk of damaging your credit if you ca n’t pay the bill .
Remember cash ?
Those small - dollar purchases you make using a credit card may not seem like much individually , but they add up when examined collectively .
The next time you want to add a fancy latte or new video game to your shopping list , put the credit card away and buy only what you can afford using the cash in your wallet .
Follow this advice , and those last - minute additions might not seem so necessary - and your credit card wo n’t get a workout .
Make budget maintenance a priority .
Schedule a weekly appointment on your calendar to review what you ’ve spent during the previous week , ensure that any outstanding bills are paid on time , and identify upcoming expenses so you can plan to cover them .
Schedule this time just as you would a doctor ’s appointment or business meeting , and you ’re more likely to perform these important budget reviews and manage your finances more effectively .
Communicate with your creditors .
If you ’ve been making consistent payments , call your card provider , and request an interest rate reduction or new monthly repayment schedule so that due dates fall after you receive your paycheck .
Consumers who shift their payment due dates can often allocate their income more effectively and ensure timely payments .
You have nothing to lose by making these requests .
Expect the unexpected .
Lets face it life happens and being prepared with an emergency fund can help you avoid placing these expenses on your credit cards .
While paying down debt is important , saving is equally important .
You never know when a job loss or medical emergency may happen .
Set a realistic goal and reward .
Calculate a date when you ’d like to pay off a credit card or bill and then enjoy a small splurge for all of your hard work .
There ’s a psychological boost to be gained when achieving each milestone on the way to becoming debt - free .
Seek help from a debt relief provider .
You have tried all of the above but it just does n’t seem to be enough — the end is nowhere in sight .
Consider talking to reputable debt relief provider that can tailor solutions based on your needs .
There are several options available for debt relief .
A debt management plan consolidates your unsecured debt into a single monthly payment that you send to a debt relief provider who then distributes designated funds to your creditors .
After you make a string of timely payments , the debt relief provider leverages that history to secure benefits to help you fulfill your obligations over time ( e.g. , interest rate reductions , late and over - the - limit fee waivers , and reduced monthly payments ) .
Another plan , debt settlement , helps people who ca n’t repay their debt in full and are facing bankruptcy .
Under this arrangement , your debt relief provider approaches your creditors with an offer to settle your accounts for a portion of the amount owed .
Getting out of credit card debt brightens your financial future but smart credit card use can help to keep you debt free .
If you struggled with credit card debt , what did you do to say goodbye ?
The little Romeo that could has found his subway sweetheart .
Patrick Moberg , a Brooklyn Web designer who embarked on a multimedia quest to find the rosy - cheeked straphanger for whom he fell on the No. 5 train , says he has managed to track down “ the woman of his dreams . ”
“ When I was walking to work today , I suddenly realized , wow , this is insane , ” said Moberg , 21 .
“ New York has a ton of people .
I do n’t know how this worked .
It was less than 48 hours .
I ’m amazed by how quick I got a response . ”
The “ mysterious brunette ” from his Sunday subway ride is actually Camille Hayton , a BlackBook magazine intern from Melbourne , Australia .
“ This is crazy .
I ca n’t believe it ’s happening , ” said Hayton , 22 , of Brooklyn .
The two have e-mailed back and forth and plan to meet for a cup of coffee this weekend .
“ We ’re just going to chat , ” said Moberg .
“ I just want to know how she reacted to all of this . ”
On paper , they seem like a decent match .
He ’s obviously a die - hard idealist with artistic tendencies , while she said on her Facebook page that she loves “ anything romantic ” for movies .
Moberg said he ’s gotten loads of responses ever since he created the site dedicated to finding Hayton after he spotted her Sunday on the train .
On nygirlofmydreams.com , he drew a picture of the girl who captivated him , with blue shorts , black leggings , and a red flower in her dark hair .
He must have been seriously smitten , because he also posted his cellphone number and his e-mail and begged the public to help him find his lady love .
Soon enough , his inbox was brimming with letters , and his phone was ringing off the hook .
“ Some people said , ‘ I ’m not the girl , but you ’re so adorable , pick me instead , ’ ” Moberg said .
But he was n’t tempted , and his patience paid off Tuesday night .
A friend of Hayton ’s texted him and said he recognized her from Moberg ’s drawing .
“ I kind of dismissed it because I got so many e-mails like that from people , ” he said .
“ I replied back and said that would be amazing if you could contact her and then I let it go . ”
But a little while later , an e-mail came to him with a pic of the fetching Hayton , asking , “ Is this your dream girl ? ”
And it was .
“ I replied back and said let me know if she ’s OK to catch up , ” he said .
Hayton – a theater , art and photography student who graduated from University of California at Santa Cruz – wrote him that “ she was n’t sure if she would live up to my expectations and I said ‘ There are no expectations , ’ ” he said .
Sadly , he might have to comfort his new gal pal .
Her home in New York was burned to the ground a few weeks ago , according to friends .

Joe Scarborough is quickly driving progressives and independents away from MSNBC in the morning .
This discussion is a case in point : the recent revelations that the CIA destroyed interrogation tapes depicting torture , and Joe goes FOXNews crazy , attacking co-host David Shuster , who suggested the tapes may have been destroyed to cover up war crimes , and that torture does n't work and is barbaric and wrong .
Scarborough breaks out all the right wing talking points and does his best Sean Hannity impersonation .
If I wanted to hear right wing propaganda and lies I 'd tune into FOXNews .

OSLO , Norway ( CNN ) -- Al Gore praised Japan and Europe -- but chided the U.S. and China -- for their efforts to combat climate change , " a planetary emergency " at which the former U.S. vice president took aim Monday as he accepted the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize .
Gore shared the honor -- and the $ 1.6 million in award money -- with the U.N. 's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , which was represented by scientist Rajendra Pachauri .
Gore said he intends to donate his prize money to an organization that strives to persuade people to cut emissions and reduce global warming .
In his acceptance speech Monday before Norway 's royalty and other invited guests , Gore said the world is at a " fateful fork " and must find ways to counteract the shifting global temperatures .
" We , the human species , are confronting a planetary emergency , a threat to the survival of our civilization that is gathering ominous and destructive potential even as we gather here , " Gore said .
Gore struck a more optimistic tone in saying it is n't too late to reverse the crisis and avoid some -- but not all of the consequences -- " if we act boldly , decisively and quickly . "
Watch as Gore says , " The future is knocking on our door " »
Gore applauded European and Japanese moves to fight climate change but singled out China and the United States -- the worst offenders -- for balking on their responsibilities to help curb carbon emissions .
The two countries " will need to make the boldest moves or stand accountable before history for their failure to act . "
The former vice president called for nations to undertake several initiatives .
Among them : ratify a treaty establishing a global cap on emissions by 2010 , a moratorium on building coal - burning facilities that do n't safely trap carbon and a carbon dioxide tax .
A tax is the easiest and most effective way to deal with climate change , Gore said .
" These are the last few years of decision , but they can be the first years of a bright and hopeful future if we do what we must , " Gore said .
" No one should believe a solution should be found without effort , without cost , without change . "
Watch why Gore has hope for after the election
Pachauri , chairman of the U.N. panel splitting the award with Gore , also told the audience that conquering the climate threat is within society 's reach .
" Climate change today poses novel risks often outside the range of experience , such as impacts related to drought , heat waves , accelerated glacier threat and hurricane intensity , " Pachauri said .
" The global community needs to coordinate a far more proactive effort toward implementing adaptation measures in the most vulnerable communities and systems in the world . "
In announcing the award in October , the Nobel committee credited Gore with being " one of the world 's leading environmental politicians " and the U.N. climate panel with highlighting links between human activity and global warming .
The World Meteorological Organization and the U.N. Environment Program formed the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 1988 .
Rather than conducting its own research , the panel reviews scientific literature from around the world .
Winning the Nobel Peace Prize caps off a string of high laurels for Gore .
" An Inconvenient Truth , " a documentary on global warming that features Gore , captured two Academy Awards in February .
Gore also picked up an Emmy for co-creating " Current TV , " a show that describes itself as a global television network giving viewers the opportunity to create and influence its programming .
Previous American recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize include former Presidents Jimmy Carter ( 2002 ) , Woodrow Wilson ( 1919 ) and Theodore Roosevelt ( 1906 ) .
A look back at the last dozen peace prize winners »
In 1973 , former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger shared the award with North Vietnam 's Le Duc Tho , who declined his share of the award , citing the situation in his country .
The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. received the honor in 1964 .
Last year , the Nobel committee awarded the prize to Bangladeshi banker Muhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank , which he founded to provide credit with no collateral to poor residents of Bangladesh .

A number of people have been riffing on the how “ Web 2.0 ” is the new vendor lock - in .
The week started with a post by Alex Iskold entitled Towards the Attention Economy : Will Attention Silos Ever Open Up ? where he wrote
At a quick glance there maybe nothing wrong with the way things are today .
For example , you can login to Amazon and see your order history , you can see what you rented on Netflix or what you bought on eBay .
The problem is that the information is not readily portable and not readily available via a common interface .
Because of this , managing your attention information is practically impossible .
…
Consider a different industry - banking .
Each bank makes your recent financial transactions exportable in a few formats - pdf , comma separated , Excel , etc .
An export in Excel is actually an interesting example , because it illustrates how your information can be leveraged .
By exporting information from your bank and credit card into Excel you are able to take it to your financial adviser who can in turn analyze it .
The point is that your financial information is portable .
On the other hand your Netflix rental history is not .
You can argue that it is possible to copy and paste it out of Netflix , but the cost of doing this is prohibitive for individuals .
Of course , not every “ Web 2.0 ” company is like Netflix and some do provide APIs for getting out your data .
But I think Mark Pilgrim has a great point in his post Let ’s not and say we did where he writes
Praising companies for providing APIs to get your own data out is like praising auto companies for not filling your airbags with gravel .
I ’m not saying data export is n’t important , it ’s just aiming kinda low .
You mean when I give you data , you ’ll… give it back to me ?
People who think this is the pinnacle of freedom are n’t really worth listening to .
Please , we need a Free Data movement .
( Yeah I know , Tim predicted it already .
I was the one who told him , at FOO Camp the month before . )
Back in the day , I thought Steve Gillmor ’s Attention Trust was a step in the direction of a Free Data movement but since then all I ’ve seen out of that crowd was either irrelevant ( e.g. XML formats that replace OPML blogrolls ) or ill - thought out ( e.g. attempting to create " business opportunities " by forming companies which act as middle men who resold your data to the Amazon 's and Netflix's of the world , kinda like Microsoft 's Hailstorm vision ) .
I keep wondering if we ’ll ever see this Free Data movement .
However there is another problem we have to face even if a Free Data movement does take hold .
In a follow up post to the piece by Alex Iskold entitled Attention mashups , Dave Winer gets to the heart of the matter in his characteristic blunt style when he writes
But whose data is it ??
Seems it belongs to the users and they should be able to take it where they want .
Sure Yahoo is providing a recommendation engine , that 's nice ( and thanks ) , but they also get to use my data for their own purposes .
Seems like a fair trade .
And I 'm a paying customer of Netflix .
They just lowered the price but I 'd much rather have gotten a dividend in the form of being able to use my own data .
Think of the mashups that would be possible .
Would n't it be great to link up Match.com with movie ratings to find dates that like the same movies ?
One of the bitter truths about " Web 2.0 " is that your data is n't all that interesting , our data on the other hand is very interesting .
Dave Winer ’s mash up example is n’t interesting because he wants to be able to get his data out of Netflix but because he wants to be able to combine his data with every body else ’s data .
This is where our “ potential ” Free Data movement will run into problems .
The first is that a lot of “ Web 2.0 ” websites provide value to their users via wisdom of the crowds appproaches such as tagging or recommendations which are simply not possible with a single user ’s data set or with a small set of users .
This leads to a tendency for the rich to get richer because since they have the most data they provide the most value for end users ( e.g. Amazon ) .
Another problem is that social software leads to lock - in .
My buddy list on Windows Live Messenger and my list of friends in Facebook are useless to me outside the context of these applications .
Although I can get all of my history and data out of these services , I lose the value I get from the fact that all my friends use these services as well .
Again , my data is n’t what is interesting .
Being able to get your data out via APIs is a good first step but what is really interesting is being able to get everyone else ’s data out of the service as well .
Then we would have the beginings of truly open and free data on the Web which would lead to very , very interesting possibilities .

In Europe , what was once unthinkable - backing another , potentially bloody conflagration against an Islamic power while the world is still bogged down in Iraq - has become a possibility .
Even before Bush started talking in October in Old Testament terms about a third world war being triggered by Iran , the French foreign minister had argued back in September that Iran 's nuclear programme was bringing the west to the brink : " We have to prepare for the worst , and the worst is war . "
Ahmadinejad , however , has suckered the west into a confrontation for his own reasons .
He has derailed Iran 's economy , squandering record oil profits and paralysing the banks .
He has alienated his core support among the poor .
He has brazenly attempted to rig clerical institutions , the machinery that turns out Shiadom 's future leaders , so as to consolidate his rule .
Such an audacious plan , from a man who could once do no wrong , has triggered a momentous fight - back from affronted clerics and senior political figures .
Those who know him best say Ahmadinejad has come to realise that it will take something momentous for him to hold on to power come the parliamentary elections next March - hence his provocations .
Vali Nasr , an Iranian - born professor of international politics at Tufts University in Boston , goes so far as to say , " He desperately needs war with America to survive politically in a country that is as exhausted as Europe and the US is with his increasingly volatile grandstanding . "
For a visitor , the sheer size of Iran 's capital is daunting .
Tehran is one of the modern megalopolises , twice as populous as London .
The wealthy northern suburb of Elahieh is often highlighted as proof of the emerging new Iranian society : photographs of Gucci - clad women and men in jeans are beamed around the world as evidence of change .
However , it soon becomes obvious that its influence is small .
More than 10 million poor , religiously conservative residents dominate the city .
They migrated here during the years of the Shah , when bungled land reforms allocated such small parcels of agricultural land to them that no one could produce enough food to survive .
Today they live cheek by jowl : the chadoris , women swathed head to foot in semi- circular black robes , and the basijis , men and boys who dress like their president and who have been recruited by the million to the Basij volunteer military force of the Revolutionary Guards .
They are the country 's plain - clothed ears and eyes , as well as the morality police , enforcing a rigid vision of a Shia state .
In the city warehouses are filled with workers trimming silk carpets destined for western showrooms they will never visit .
Most have never held a passport and have little interest in seeing the world .
Ahmadinejad had barely travelled , too .
He talked proudly when he stood for the presidency in 2005 of having left Iran only once , " for a short trip to Austria . "
He appeared to be one of the people .
In Iran what you wear is a political statement , and he sounded and dressed as they did .
Conjuring the time when he was among the disenfranchised mass who signed up to the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps established by Ayatollah Khomeini , he promised to take people back to the pious values of 1979 .
A turning point in his campaign came when he released a short film showing him dining cross-legged on the floor of his simple , working - class home on Tehran 's 72nd square , his wife hidden by her chador .
Compare this with the image of his opponent , Hashemi Rafsanjani , two - time president , a wealthy ayatollah whose family owned hundreds of acres of pistachio orchards in Kerman province , and who produced ill - judged campaign ads showing him discussing the lack of entertainment options with a group of affluent , western - dressed teenagers from Elahieh .
When Ahmadinejad appeared on the international stage he seemed unconventional , even shabby , among the crowd of sombre suits ; his uniform was a crumpled jacket , buttoned - up shirt and beard , his nervous smile made him seem modest and simultaneously embarrassed .
World leaders overlooked his apparent ignorance of the niceties of international diplomacy and his street vernacular , drawn from the working - class suburb of Tehran where he grew up , the youngest son of a migrant worker .
But it soon became clear that this former student of traffic management and one - time mayor of Tehran was advancing a radical conservative agenda .
An intensely religious man , he began to sound Talibanesque in his pronouncements .
There were no homosexuals in Iran , he said ( without explaining this was because they were forced to undergo sex - change operations at the government 's expense ) .
Women belonged in the chador , he declared , as his administration published figures showing that in just two months 160,000 had been charged with being insufficiently veiled earlier this year .
Public hangings - which had not been seen in the capital for many years - returned to the city 's streets and were broadcast on live TV .
After drawing international condemnation for restarting Iran 's stalled nuclear programme , Ahmadinejad raised the temperature by sacking Ali Larijani , Iran 's vastly experienced secular nuclear negotiator , replacing him with a former militia leader .
Throughout Tehran , there are 60 ft - high posters depicting Iran 's " martyrs " , the million soldiers who fell during the eight - year war with Iraq in the 80s .
The ghosts of the dead fill the city .
Ahmadinejad has invoked them at every stage of his political career .
He reminds people that when he was mayor in 2003 , he had martyrs ' bodies exhumed from their provincial cemeteries and reburied in the capital 's squares so that wherever people walked there were memories of loss beneath their feet .
Patriotism was only one string he pulled .
At the heart of his election message was a claim that chimed with the deeply religious poor : a divine force protected him and would help the Iranian people get closer to God , too .
In a series of national roadshows that became his political signature , he insisted that messengers from heaven had told him that the Mahdi , a messiah - like figure who Iranian Shi'ites believe vanished in AD873 , was about to return to the mortal world bringing salvation .
According to the sacred texts of Shi'ism , the Mahdi's reappearance would establish a just Islamic society at a time of war and chaos and , citing one such text , Ahmadinejad and his spiritual advisers declared that that time was now .
It must surely rank as one of the most hyperbolic manifesto pledges ever made , but still , it got Ahmadinejad elected .
The new president then shared his vision with the UN general assembly in September 2005 .
During his address he appealed to God to " hasten the emergence of ... the Promised One ... "
After he left the meeting , Ahmadinejad had a conversation with an Iranian cleric , describing how he had felt the hand of God in the UN , which was recorded and uploaded on to the net : " I felt it myself ... for 27 to 28 minutes all the leaders did not blink .
They were astonished ...
It 's not an exaggeration , I was looking . "
But there was no point making such grand pledges if he could not provide the evidence .
Ahmadinejad began furiously investing millions of pounds to animate his claim that the Mahdi was coming .
And he chose to do it at one of the holiest places in Iran .
The city of Qom , 90 miles south of Tehran , on the edge of the Kavir desert , is the scene of frenzied building work .
According to local tradition , the Mahdi once appeared here in a vision to a shepherd watering his sheep at a well on the outskirts of the city , and devotees believe that it will be from this well that he re-emerges .
For several hundred years a small mosque , known as Jamkaran , stood on the vision site , attracting pilgrims who scribbled their innermost desires on scraps of paper that they threw into the well .
One of Ahmadinejad 's first acts in power was to have his entire cabinet sign a piece of paper that was also put down the well , a pledge to transform the mosque into a place worthy of the Mahdi 's presence .
Soon after , posters started appearing on the streets of Tehran declaring , " He 's Coming . "
There was talk of a fast train link to connect Jamkaran to the capital in case the Mahdi turned up without warning , enabling politicians to get to the mosque in double - quick time .
Today it resembles an Islamic Lourdes .
The modest mosque has been embellished with 100ft minarets , blue - tiled domes and new prayer halls .
Hundreds of thousands of devout , working - class Iranians flock to the site , especially on Tuesday nights , the reputed time for the Mahdi 's reappearance .
Ahmadinejad shuttles here almost weekly , and whenever he appears he is mobbed like a rock star .
A holy of holies in an ultra-conservative country , it is out of bounds to western tourists who catch only a blur of blue tiles from their coaches as they are escorted down the motorway to the archaeological sites of Esfahan , Persepolis and Shiraz .
As the sun burns red , dozens of cranes and earthmovers move along the horizon .
Every road leading to the mosque is filled with chadoris , who run , clutching bags and children , to claim a small patch on the tarmac perimeter where they will eat , sleep and pray through the night .
Ahead , the mosque is illuminated by a hundred thousand bulbs .
Tears wash down the faces of worshippers as they catch their first glimpse of the minarets .
As the muezzin's call wells up from deep inside the complex at 7 pm , the crowds kneel as one in prayer .
The maddah , or storyteller , takes the crowd on an emotional late - night journey .
" Come on , come on !
I have a fear of not seeing You ! " he cries , appealing to the Mahdi , as the crowds sway and sob .
He tells stories of martyrs who have come back in his dreams to warn that Iran has lost its way , and that until it returns to its revolutionary roots they will not reach paradise .
Only Ahmadinejad can be trusted to carry out this exorcism , he warns .
It is a message that resounds with every family here , as all have lost brothers , sons and fathers .
" We must follow our president who is brave and facing western aggression , " says Farida Milani , from Yazd , who is here with her wheelchair - bound mother .
Before Ahmadinejad came along , Qom was home to one vitally important shrine , and it was not Jamkaran .
The city was world - famous among Shias as the burial spot of Lady Fatima Masuma , a direct descendent of the Prophet Muhammad , whose death here more than a millennium ago transformed a previously forlorn desert settlement into a pilgrimage site .
It became a centre of learning in the 20s , when Shi'ite intellectuals , including Ruhollah Khomeini , began gathering .
When he returned from exile in 1979 as Grand Ayatollah Khomeini , he resettled in Qom , from where he led the country 's transformation into an Islamic republic , turning the city 's seminaries into its ideological engine .
Soon there would be 300 madrasas taking in 50,000 students .
Qom was tasked with fomenting Iran 's theocratic foreign policy ; it became a place much feared by the US and Israel .
Both accuse it of being a provocative source of inspiration for students affiliated to extreme groups , including Hezbollah and Hamas , who come to study at the government 's expense .
Some have also returned to seek sanctuary , including Imad Mughniyah , Hezbollah 's special operations chief , spotted in Qom in 2001 .
He has been accused of masterminding the 1983 bomb attacks on the US embassy and marine barracks in Beirut that killed 304 , the 1985 hijacking of TWA flight 847 and numerous kidnappings of westerners in Beirut .
More recently , he was blamed for the attack on a Jewish community centre in Buenos Aires in 1994 that left 92 people dead .
For these reasons Qom has been identified as a possible target in any US attack .
Ahmadinejad knew that scores of high - ranking clerics would be affronted by his manipulation of the Mahdi story , derisive of his scholarship and critical of what many saw as a cynical attempt to undermine the one man who had the authority to sack him .
His claims challenged Grand Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , Iran 's Supreme Leader and commander - in - chief , whose official title , vali-e faqih , means " God 's jurisprudent on earth " - a direct link with the divine that would be superseded if the Mahdi showed his face .
Although the Supreme Leader had done more than anyone to get the president elected , issuing directives to all Revolutionary Guardsmen and their families to vote for him in 2005 , relations soured after Ahmadinejad proved not to be the malleable figure Khamenei had hoped for .
Frozen out by the theocratic establishment , Ahmadinejad fought back .
He began lambasting many of the city 's septuagenarian clerics for being corrupt and soft , reminding people that some had become rich during the Iraq war trading weapons and selling ration cards .
In Qom , Ahmadinejad sought to eclipse long - established seminaries with his own to bring the city under his control .
Government money was poured into the Imam Khomeini Institute , a hardline madrasa whose scholars were charged with trawling through religious treatises to find evidence that the Mahdi 's re-emergence at Jamkaran was imminent .
Ahmadinejad placed in charge Mohammad Taghi Mesbah - Yazdi , a cleric who would soon become known as an ayatollah , a significant promotion without the normal years of study .
Mesbah - Yazdi has become Ahmadinejad 's ideological mentor .
They first met in the early 80s when Ahmadinejad attended a series of his lectures on the philosopher Martin Heidegger , who had been championed by the Nazis .
Here , Ahmadinejad found the noisy , blue - collar nationalism that he would imbue with hyper - spirituality .
He created a vision of a pious and soldierly people easing the path of the coming Mahdi .
Abbas Milani , director of Iranian studies at Stanford University in California , who has studied Ahmadinejad 's background , explains .
" Mesbah - Yazdi forged key elements of an Islamic pseudo - fascist ideology founded on a sour brew of anti-Semitism and Heideggerian philosophy ...
This in turn has informed Ahmadinejad 's world view . "
An enthusiastic supporter of the death penalty and public floggings , Mesbah - Yazdi was recently elected to the Assembly of Experts , the body responsible for choosing the next Supreme Leader .
He has made it clear he is eyeing the top job .
The ground floor of the Imam Khomeini Iistitute is given over to a large bookshop exclusively selling works by Mesbah - Yazdi .
His image is plastered on every wall .
Turbaned mullahs enter the building on their way to class .
Students come from all over the Muslim world - Pakistan , Afghanistan , Lebanon , Palestine ; there are even a handful from America .
A white - bearded ayatollah approaches and asks , " What are you doing here ? "
After a garbled explanation about wishing to study Islamic law , he introduces himself as Ayatollah Haghani , Yazdi 's director of international affairs .
He is clearly uncertain , but agrees to show the library where mullahs hunch at study stations , their turbans neatly hanging on a hat - rack in the corner .
The shelves are stacked with volumes by Marx , Popper and Russell , and in the periodicals section are anti-terrorism papers produced by Chatham House , in London .
The ayatollah 's phone trills a Qu'ranic prayer ; whoever is on the line is angry that foreigners are here .
" You must leave , " the ayatollah says curtly .
The elevator descends in silence and as the doors open on the ground floor three meaty security guards jump in .
Behind them is the unmistakable figure of Mesbah - Yazdi .
He brushes past , scowling , in a whirl of coffee - coloured robes .
He signals for visitors to be escorted out .
Controlling Qom was only one plank in Ahmadinejad 's strategy .
As a parvenu , wresting power from the political establishment has been equally important , and he has done it with gusto , filling the cabinet and major administrative bureaucracies with former Revolutionary Guards and intelligence officials .
His new intelligence minister is Gholam Hossein Mohseni - Ejehei , a man whom only a little digging reveals has been linked to the murders of Iranian political activists .
The new interior minister , Mostafa Pour Mohammadi , sat on a three - person committee in 1988 that ordered the execution of thousands of political prisoners .
Even the culture ministry has been turned upside down .
Its new chief is Hossein Saffar Harandi , a university buddy of Ahmadinejad and former Basij leader , whose first act in office was to call upon Iranian musicians to compose a symphony of support for Iran 's nuclear programme , and who has shut down almost every newspaper and website critical of the regime .
" It 's not what they did in the past that matters but what they do in the future , " the president has said in defence of his men .
This is precisely what worries Shirin Ebadi , the Nobel peace prize - winning Iranian lawyer , who told the Guardian , " The situation in Iran has worsened considerably with these new men in power . "
Women who complain of rape have been stoned .
The age of consent for girls has been lowered to nine .
Children have been convicted and executed for adult crimes .
Barbers have been jailed for shaving beards .
Yet , for all Ahmadinejad 's efforts to control every aspect of Iranian life , his authority has begun slipping away .
Some of Iran 's most senior clerics have questioned the manipulation of the Mahdi story .
Mesbah - Yazdi has been derided as Professor Crocodile ( the name Mesbah rhymes with temsah , the Persian word for the reptile ) , while Ahmadinejad has been accused of " endangering the reputation of Islam and the Qur'an " by Javadi - Amoli , an ayatollah at the Qom seminary school .
But the most damaging criticism comes from Iran 's Grand Ayatollahs , a band of 19 leaders whose spiritual authority remains unquestioned .
They , too , have become enraged by the upstart in his Revolutionary Guards suit .
At his modest headquarters , Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri , Khomeini 's former deputy , sits cross-legged , a skullcap covering his remaining wisps of grey hair .
He does not hold back .
He accuses the current regime of despotism , over - reliance on Iran 's security forces and disrespect for the seminary .
" Power brings ignorance , and those in power now have forgotten what the revolution was for . "
He pauses , aware of the weight of his words .
" They have become extremists , going in a different direction . "
The Jamkaran extravaganza has enraged the grand ayatollah .
" People go expecting to see the Mahdi sitting there in a corner .
They are being misled .
It is wrong .
The Mahdi is very dear to our people and the politicians are taking advantage . "
He has one more thing to add : " Iran needs to put aside all the bad blood and America needs to stop interfering , before it creates another Iraq or Afghanistan . "
At his Qom madrasa , Grand Ayatollah Yusef Saanei has begun to make some startling pronouncements : women having equal rights to men , non-Muslims being treated as respectfully as Muslims , listening to music being permissible , men being allowed to shave their beards .
On his wall is a framed quote from Khomeini , saying , " I have raised Mr Saanei like a son of mine . "
" America thinks Iran is violent and responsible for all its ills , " he says .
" It is up to our leaders to show the world the difference between Sunni and Shia Islam , to show Shia Islam has never condoned terrorism and renounces terrorist groups like al - Qaida . "
Unlike his president , he wants reconciliation .
" After Khomeini died , the spirit of what he believed in died away , too .
If the current president continues , there will be no new generation . "
Saanei taps his cane .
" If the people now in power carry on , Iran will crumple from the inside and die . "
Outside Qom , dissent is building , too .
People have begun to question how far Ahmadinejad is prepared to go with his nuclear sabre - rattling and whether the country can defend itself against US " surgical strikes " .
Among targets already identified by Washington hawks are Revolutionary Guards facilities , many of them in the capital .
Last month Jomhuri Eslami , an influential conservative newspaper , chastised the president in a front - page editorial for describing officials who advocated restraint in the nuclear stand - off as " traitors and spies " .
However , the most significant threat to Ahmadinejad is his appalling economic record .
As soon as he became president , he began increasing state control and destroying the free market .
Ministry of finance officials were replaced by clerics with no economic experience ; Ayatollah Mesbah - Yazdi was appointed Ahmadinejad 's main economic adviser .
Together they have implemented a series of disastrous reforms dictated by the principles of Sharia law .
After Mesbah - Yazdi likened banks to loan sharks , Iran 's independent banking sector was crippled by a raft of restrictive measures .
A low - interest loans scheme for small businesses , designed to encourage job creation , collapsed .
Millions have been spent on popular measures , such as the " Love Fund " to help poor young men meet the costs of marriage , and the minimum wage has been increased by 60 % .
But more than 20 % are now out of work and the urban poor , Ahmadinejad 's backbone , have been floored by rising prices .
Iran should be one of the richest countries in the world .
It is , after all , the fourth largest oil producer and has the second biggest natural gas reserve .
But the president has squandered windfall oil revenues on billion - dollar no ...# 8209 ; bid contracts awarded to companies owned by friends in the Revolutionary Guards .
In the past 18 months , millions of dollars worth of oil revenue is thought to have disappeared into individual pockets as the military has moved seamlessly into building airports , producing oil and opening mobile phone networks , transforming Iran into a military state not unlike its neighbour , Pakistan .
Mohammad Ghouchani , editor of the Hammihan newspaper , says , " Ahmadinejad likes to present himself as Robin Hood , taking from the rich to help the poor , but his scattergun and ill - conceived policies have achieved precisely the opposite . "
Evidence that this message is sinking in came in September when a poll found that 56 % of Ahmadinejad 's supporters in 2005 would not turn out for him again .
Meanwhile , Hashemi Rafsanjani , the reformist he outwitted in 2005 , has gathered strength .
Iran 's former ambassador to the UK , Hossein Adeli , has appealed to the west to back down .
" This country , this baby of revolution , has been living 30 years in isolation under a deep sense of insecurity , and the majority of Iranians are tired .
We are trapped in a wall of deep mistrust and suspicion with the US and UK that has now reached its peak .
Our officials and your officials sit in their respective positions issuing rhetoric for their domestic audiences .
They 're worrying about winning the next election , not communicating with the other side or seeing the ground realities . "
Adeli should know .
Until Ahmadinejad forced him out of office in December 2005 , he had been handling secret discussions between Tehran , London and the Bush administration .
What should happen next ?
" We have to start talking .
If we do n't , Ahmadinejad will be saved by people who have begun to loathe him .
Washington needs to stop , take breath and realise we have many common strategic interests .
Iran 's most important strength , our weapon , is our influence in the heartland of the world . "
Instead of open hostilities , Adeli calls for investment coupled with an offer of unconditional negotiations from Washington .
He believes that would provide the impetus for some of the four million wealthy Iranians exiles who took a trillion dollars worth of capital with them to return and launch a campaign for the Islamic Republic 's first ever democratic election .
It is one that Ahmadinejad would now most likely lose .
LOS ANGELES - They call themselves the Regulators .
They wear tattoos of a skull - faced man holding a shotgun , fire screaming from its barrels .
They refuse to testify against their friends .
They 've been accused of extorting and intimidating those outside their ranks .
No , they 're not members of a street gang .
They 're Los Angeles County sheriff 's deputies at the Century station in Lynwood .
And their " club " is part of a culture that 's dogged the nation 's largest sheriff 's department for years .
A decade after the county paid $ 9 million to resolve a series of brutality lawsuits involving a different group of Lynwood deputies known as the Vikings , the Regulators are the focus of litigation alleging racism in the department and involving accusations that a group of deputies is behaving like a gang .
This time the lawsuit was filed by a deputy , Angel Jaimes , a Regulators member who alleges that black administrators in the department unfairly stalled his career by referring to him and other Hispanic deputies as the Mexican Mafia , a notorious prison gang .
Jaimes , a beefy 43 - year - old who joined the department in 1989 , said the Regulators are nothing more than a close - knit group of deputies , not exclusively Hispanics , who support one another and promote aggressive , ethical policing that keeps communities safe .
Only deputies who work hard and follow policy are encouraged to join , Jaimes said .
" It 's like the all - stars of a baseball team .
You get the best , " he said .
Jaimes would not disclose how many deputies belong to the group , but he says he was the 63d to join when he signed up years ago .
They do n't all still work at the Century station , which is staffed by more than 100 deputies .
Allegations of misconduct by Regulators have simmered for more than four years .
Anonymous letters , purportedly drafted by deputies not in the group , have accused members of extorting money from other deputies , acting like gang members , and heavily influencing shift scheduling and administration at the Century station .
But no allegations have been proved , Sheriff 's Department officials say .
In 2003 , the first of two anonymous letters was sent to Sheriff 's Department executives about the Regulators .
The letter referred to the group as the Mexican Mafia and accused Jaimes and another member of " strong - arming " deputies to contribute money for deputies in need .
" They do n't ask for a contribution , rather they demand and enforce the payment of a set price , " according to the letter , which was signed by " a concerned deputy . "
A second letter , mailed in 2004 , said , " Something has to be done immediately , maybe a cleaning of the station to get rid of the gang mentality of the Mexican Mafia . "
Members of the Regulators acknowledge that they raise money for deputies in need , including some who have been suspended without pay for violating department policy .
But they deny ever pressuring fellow deputies to contribute .
Jaimes 's lawsuit , which seeks to overturn his 2004 transfer from the Century station , has led to allegations of racial tension within the department and has shed new light on the culture of groups like the Regulators .
One of Jaimes 's potential witnesses is Lieutenant Terri Williams , who has testified previously that two black Sheriff 's Department executives told her they were concerned that Century station " was run by Mexicans and they were going to change that . "
But many of the group 's activities and members remain cloaked in secrecy .
Deputy James Grubb , a longtime member of the Regulators , refused under questioning from Los Angeles County attorneys to confirm whether some deputies were members of the group .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Telecommuting may boost morale , and cut stress , but it can have the opposite effect on those left behind in the office , according to a new study .
When a number of their co-workers toil away from the office by using computers , cell - phones or other electronic equipment , those who do not telecommute are more likely to be dissatisfied with their job and leave the company , said Timothy Golden , a management professor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute .
Telecommuting has been a growing trend in the United States since about 2000 .
About 37 percent of U.S. - based and international companies now offer flexible work arrangements , with the number of those programs growing at a rate of 11 percent per year , according to the Society of Human Resource Management .
Several studies have touted the health and morale benefits for flexible workers , but Golden ’s research suggests that their co-workers tend to find the workplace less enjoyable , have fewer emotional ties to co-workers and generally feel less obligated to the organization .
“ While reasons for the adverse impact on non-teleworkers are varied , it possibly is due to co-worker ’s perceptions that they have decreased flexibility and a higher workload and the greater frustration that comes with coordinating in an environment with more extensive telework , ” Golden said .
He added that with a greater prevalence of telecommuters in a work unit , non-telecommuters find it less personally fulfilling to do their work .
But by ensuring greater face - to - face contact between co-workers when all employees are in the office and granting greater job autonomy , employers may be able to counter these problems , according to the study published in the journal Human Relations .
“ There ’s little doubt that work life impacts one ’s role in the family .
However , organizational decision makers need to take into account the broader impact of telework on others in the office , ” Golden said .
He studied a sample of 240 professional employees from a medium - sized company .

The fashion crackdown is more serious than in previous years
The police say they will also suppress " decadent " films , drugs and alcohol .
This year has seen one of the most ferocious crackdowns on un-Islamic behaviour and improper Islamic dress by the authorities for at least a decade .
But it has now emerged the current campaign has the overt backing of the Supreme Leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
The police are warning they will deal seriously with any women who dare to wear short trousers , skimpy overcoats or skirts that are revealingly transparent or have slits in them .
In this way , we will have a society that is safe and inclined towards other social , economic , cultural and political activities
Law Enforcement Force
Anger at dress restrictions
Wearing boots instead of full length trousers will not be tolerated , nor will hats instead of headscarves .
Indeed , the police stipulate that small headscarves are out - the scarf must cover a woman 's head and neck completely .
The police say they will also clamp down on " decadent " films , drugs , alcohol , extortion and general thuggish behaviour , but it is issues of dress that are given most prominence .
Controversial campaign
In the last six months , tens of thousands of women have been warned or arrested because of their clothes .
IRANIAN MORAL VICES
Terrorising people by quarrelling and feuding in public Women failing to cover up in a suitable way , such as wearing short trousers revealing the leg , hats instead of scarves , small and skinny scarves that do not cover up the head , and make - up that is unconventional and violates public morality Wearing decadent Western clothes and displaying signs and insignia of deviant groups Procuring decadent films Procuring drugs and alcohol Source : E'temad newspaper
During the reformist period , Islamic dress restrictions eased dramatically in Iran , with women wearing bright colours , following Western fashions , and pushing the limits in an attempt to express their individuality .
Some sported strappy , high - heeled sandals with tight three - quarter length trousers , skin - hugging coats at least a size too small , a headscarf perched on the back of their heavily highlighted hair , topped off with large diamond - encrusted sunglasses and matching designer handbag .
But the latest police action has put an end to that kind of dress .
Last week , Ayatollah Khamenei urged the police to keep up their crackdown on social vices , clearly lending his weight to a campaign that has proved controversial .

Economy Mortgage Meltdown By Ryan McGreal
Published March 22 , 2007
With mortgage foreclosures spiking and the subprime mortgage disaster unfolding ( thirty lenders are already bankrupt with more to come ) , the damage is spreading as foreclosures and outright home abandonments rise among homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages as higher interest rates raise monthly mortgage bills beyond homeowners ' ability to pay .
" This is n't just subprime , " said Christopher Thornberg , an economist with the consulting firm Beacon Economics in Los Angeles .
" This problem is starting to occur in most of the adjustable - rate mortgages .
Even for prime borrowers , we 're seeing a big spike in delinquencies among adjustable - rate mortgages . "
Credit counselors are reporting a huge rise in calls from desperate homeowners , especially in the badly - hit industrial northern Midwest .
Fed Hints at Lower Rates
In response , the US Federal Reserve is hinting that it might lower the prime lending rate , prompting a rally in the jittery stock market .
After the NASDAQ collapse in 2001 when the bubble in high tech stocks burst , the Fed moved quickly to lower interest rates dramatically to forestall a serious recession .
With amazingly cheap credit ( at one point , the prime rate was effectively zero percent ) , demand for housing exploded as more people could suddenly afford a mortgage .
This boom in demand for houses started to push up house prices and triggered a boom in new construction .
The rising values of existing houses attracted more people to get in on the act and " invest " in a house with a rising value .
Lending agencies got in on the act by offering outlandish mortgage terms - adjustable mortgage rates , no money down , ' no - doc ' mortgages ( borrowers do not have to present proof of income ) and negative amortization ( monthly payments for the first year are less than the accrued interest , so the total mortgage actually grows ) , all predicated on the assumption that continually rising house prices would keep these people afloat .
Lenders also aggressively pushed home equity lines of credit ; homeowners could borrow against the rising value of their houses to pay for new cars , vacations , furniture , and so on .
As a result , a person could take out a $ 300,000 mortgage in 2001 and end up with a $ 500,000 mortgage in 2006 on the same house .
( If you 're wondering why no one questioned how the lenders thought they could get away with these irresponsible tactics , you may take a small measure of solace in the fact that now , after it 's too late to make a difference , the SEC is investigating the business practices that left these companies so exposed . )
Inflation Rears its Head
However , at the same time the Fed was holding credit at such a low rate , other forces were driving rising inflation rates .
The easy money policy , combined with high energy prices over the past few years , have raised prices across the board .
Despite its efforts to stimulate the economy after the dot com bubble , the Fed is biased toward holding inflation in line by raising interest rates to slow demand growth .
As interest rates have crept up by tiny increments over the past two years , payments on all those adjustable rate mortgages have crept up as well .
Because real median incomes in the US have been stagnant since 2000 , this has pushed homeowners closer to foreclosure .
Ironically , until recently , many homeowners were able to stay afloat by using home equity lines of credit to cover their rising monthly payments , increasing their total indebtedness even as they pushed back the day of reckoning .
The housing bubble peaked in 2006 , and house prices have been falling since .
Without the cushion of rising equity , the day of reckoning is starting to arrive for those millions of homeowners in over their heads .
The " magic equity machines " have lost their magic .
In A Tight Spot
The Fed has softened its stance somewhat on tightening rates , but it 's still unclear if a ) this will actually translate into a rate cut , and b ) a rate cut at this point would make much difference .
In addition to the millions of homeowners at risk of foreclosure , Wall Street is on precarious ground as well .
For several years , a growing business has seen lenders sell mortgages to investment firms , which package all those mortgages into securities at various rates of risk and return .
This allowed lenders to increase the amount of mortgages they can sell and created a bonanza on Wall Street worth trillions of dollars .
It also created a growing demand for more mortgages , which helped fuel the bubble .
So far , Wall Street insists the situation is under control , but with the amount of money at stake and the risk of a self - fulfilling prophecy , it 's not surprising that investment houses are rushing to allay investor fears .
Sanford C. Bernstein's Brad Hintz acknowledged that Wall Street dodged bullets from the subprime crisis in the first quarter and will likely thrive by buying and trading the distressed loans , but was ... concerned by the lack of disclosure [ of how much revenue is mortgage based ] .
" If the crisis spreads to other asset classes or the broader U.S. economy , the effect of this modest sector can be much greater and can impact many other businesses and asset classes , " he wrote clients on Friday .
" Unfortunately , investors will not know the ultimate impact of the sub - prime market problems until the slow - motion train wreck of rising mortgage delinquencies and defaults is played out over the rest of this year . "
In any case , it 's unlikely the troubles will stay inside the subprime sandbox .
For one thing , many prime mortgages on adjustable rates are also at risk .
For another , each foreclosed or abandoned house increases the supply of properties and lowers the average price for other homeowners , dragging yet more homeowners in to trouble .
What 's Next
How much longer can the Fed strategy of maintaining low interest rates keep the credit bubble afloat ?
Will this latest tweak even make a difference to the millions of homeowners teetering on the edge of foreclosure , or will it simply drag the mess out for even longer ?
Saddest of all , perhaps , is the likelihood that , if and when the worm finally does turn , we can expect another public bailout to save the asses of the banks that parlayed high risk mortgages into trillions of dollars in irresponsible derivatives plays - while leaving the homeowners themselves to the wolves .

It 's time again to rewind that fleshy cassette storage device in your head to yesteryear .
This week , we 're headed back to August 12 , 1981 — the date IBM introduced its Personal Computer , a system that would shape the industry and make the term " PC " synonymous with home computers .
But let 's not get ahead of ourselves .
We enter the stage of history when PCs are still called " microcomputers , " and nobody is quite sure how much profit there is to be made selling the damn things .
IBM Personal Computer ( IBM 5150 )
Released : 1981
Price : $ 1,656
OS : MS - DOS , USCD Pascal , CP / M - 86
Processor : 4.77MHz Intel 8088
Memory : 65KB ( first shipped with 16KB )
Display : 320x200
Storage : One or two 160 KB 5.25 " disk drives
In the early ' 80s , IBM had built a stellar reputation for itself selling mainframe computers to big businesses .
But the back rooms of conglomerates were n't enough for Big Blue — or as it was known back then , Medium - Sized Teal ( no , not really ) .
Despite their previous failure to sell an affordable microcomputer with the IBM 5100 , the company decided to try again after seeing the success of the Commodore PET , Apple II , Tandy 's TRS - 80s and the Atari 8 - bit computers .
IBM assembled a 12 - person team with the goal of bringing a product to market as quickly as possible , dubbed " Project Chess . "
At first , they considered buying Atari to assimilate its fledgling line of computers .
But IBM instead decided to pursue its own offering — while saving money and time by building the machine with parts bought from a variety of OEMs .
The company had previously developed its own components in - house .
IBM also decided to create an open architecture for the system ( now known internally as project " Acorn " ) .
Other manufacturers would be allowed to build and sell peripherals and software , thus creating the " IBM - compatible " legacy of PC equipment .
Project Chess was juggling between using the 16 - bit Intel 8086 processor , Motorola MC68000 and the Intel 8088 .
The latter was eventually chosen because the others were determined to be too powerful .
For the operating system , IBM first went to Digital Research , the creators of CP / M. Digital Research , however , showed little interest in the project .
IBM then turned to a small company called Microsoft , which had built some fame for itself as the creator of a BASIC interpreter for the Altair 8800 .
Bill Gates accepted IBM 's offer , but Microsoft was n't up to the challenge of writing an operating system itself .
Microsoft instead bought the rights to QDOS ( the " Quick and Dirty Operating System " ) for $ 50,000 , written by Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products .
QDOS itself was based heavily on the CP / M operating system .
Paterson had bought a CP / M manual and used it as a basis to write QDOS in six weeks — with just enough changes to fly on the upside of legal .
Gates managed to convince IBM to let Microsoft retain the rights to the operating system , all the while keeping the Seattle Computer Products purchase secret from IBM .
Microsoft would later go on to do very well indeed with licensing MS - DOS , thank you very much .
( There 's more on the OS history bit here . )
The original IBM Personal Computer came with a version of Microsoft BASIC in ROM .
The system was offered with either a CGA or MDA graphic card .
The CGA graphics card could plug into a standard television , while the MDA plugged into a monochrome display .
Standard cassette tapes were used to load and store programs .
A floppy disk drive was offered as an optional extra .
The IBM PC was still very expensive for the average home user , but found plenty success with businesses .
In 1983 , an IBM PC XT was launched with the business market in mind , offering more expansion slots and a 10 megabyte hard disk .
IBM 's machine would become a standard for the industry , and Big Blue was able to own the personal computer market until the end of the ' 80s .

A school in Doncaster is piloting a monitoring system designed to keep tabs on pupils by tracking radio chips in their uniforms .
According to the Doncaster Free Press , Hungerhill School is testing RFID tracking and data collection on 10 pupils within the school .
It 's been developed by local company Darnbro Ltd , which says it is ready to launch the product into the £ 300 m school uniform market .
Boss Trevor Darnborough said : " The Department for Education and Skills is keen to promote use of electronic registration in schools because of its benefits in efficiently monitoring pupils ' attendance and the speedy retrieval and analysis of data .
" The system saves valuable lesson time , often wasted in registration and monitoring , while ensuring parents of their children 's security .
And there 's the additional benefit of reduced costs in replacing school uniforms that have gone astray . "
The Hungerhill trial has been " successful " , he added .
Darnbro is n't the only firm with sights set on high - tech blazers .
In August Lancashire - based Trutex , " Britain 's favourite schoolwear supplier " , announced its own plans to chip schoolchildren .
David Clouter , founder of anti-fingerprinting group " Leave them kids alone " , said : " To put this in a school badge is complete and utter surveillance of the children .
Tagging is what we do to criminals we let out of prison early . "
Hungerhill headteacher Graham Wakeling said the pilot was " not intrusive to the pupil in the slightest . "

The average new car gets fewer miles to the gallon than Henry Ford ’s Model T got .
OTTO STEININGER
On September 29 , 1993 , President Bill Clinton , Vice - President Al Gore , the chief executives of G.M. , Chrysler , and Ford , and the head of the United Auto Workers gathered in the White House Rose Garden to talk about cars .
Clinton opened his remarks by reminiscing about his first — a 1952 Henry J that his stepfather had salvaged from a fire — and then about one of his “ most prized possessions ” : a 1967 ice - blue Mustang convertible .
“ I think when I left my home it was the thing that I most regretted leaving behind , ” he said of the Mustang .
“ The other people who drove on the roads in my home state , however , were immensely relieved .
“ I think that all of us have our car - crazy moments and have those stories , ” Clinton went on .
“ Today , we ’re going to try to give America a new car - crazy chapter in her rich history — to launch a technological venture as ambitious as any our nation has ever attempted . ”
The aim of the venture , the President explained , was to “ develop affordable , attractive cars that are up to three times more fuel - efficient than today ’s cars . ”
In addition to being moderately priced and energy - efficient , the new cars were supposed to be safe , comfortable , and recyclable .
The automakers and the federal government would design the vehicles jointly — the government would provide much of the funding , and make available technologies that had been developed for military use — with the understanding that at the end of a decade the manufacturers would build prototypes of sedans capable of getting eighty miles to the gallon .
The project was formally known as the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles , and early reports from those involved were promising .
By 1997 , participants had settled on the specs of the “ super car , ” as it became known : the sedan would be a lightweight , diesel - electric hybrid .
( Diesel engines , because they use a higher compression ratio , consume less fuel per mile than gasoline engines do . )
By 2000 , the Big Three had all produced concept cars , which were unveiled with much fanfare at the North American Auto Show , in Detroit .
G.M. ’s car , which was called the Precept , came equipped with two electric motors , one mounted on each axle .
Ford ’s Prodigy featured an aluminum body and rear - facing cameras in place of side - view mirrors , and the Dodge ESX3 was made in large part out of plastic .
The concept cars were wheeled out , then wheeled away , never to be seen again .
In January , 2002 , just months before the prototypes of the vehicles were supposed to be delivered and after more than a billion dollars of federal money had been spent , Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham announced that the Bush Administration was scrapping the project .
When he delivered the announcement , Abraham was flanked by top executives from the Big Three , at least one of whom — G.M. ’s chairman , Jack Smith — had stood next to President Clinton when he launched the program , eight years earlier .
Abraham explained — and the auto executives seemed to agree — that the program had been based on a fundamentally flawed premise .
The future of the car did n’t lie with diesel hybrids or any other technology that would allow vehicles to get eighty miles to the gallon .
“ We can do better than that , ” Abraham declared .
The Administration and the automakers , he said , were undertaking a new , even more ambitious venture , called FreedomCAR .
The goal of this project was to produce vehicles that would run on pure hydrogen .
So will a “ super car ” or a “ FreedomCAR ” or a “ hypercar ” or any of the other revolutionary new cars that have been proposed ever get built ?
Iain Carson and Vijay V. Vaitheeswaran , the authors of “ Zoom : The Global Race to Fuel the Car of the Future ” ( Twelve ; $ 27.99 ) , answer this question with a qualified “ yes . ” Carson , who covers the transportation industry for The Economist , and Vaitheeswaran , a writer who holds an engineering degree from M.I.T. , are “ techno - optimists , ” as opposed to the “ eco- pessimists ” they sometimes deride .
Yet their argument rests on an account of global trends that is nothing short of terrifying .
Consider what ’s happening in India and China .
As Carson and Vaitheeswaran point out , car ownership in both countries has been and still remains , by U.S. standards , almost absurdly low .
There are nine personal vehicles per thousand eligible drivers in China and eleven for every thousand Indians , compared with 1,148 for every thousand Americans .
But incomes in the two countries are rising so rapidly — the Chinese economy grew by eleven per cent last year and is expected to grow by the same amount this year — that millions of vehicleless families will soon be in a position to buy automobiles .
Assuming that incomes continue to rise , in a few years tens of millions of families will be buying their first cars , and eventually hundreds of millions .
( To satisfy increasing demand in India , the country ’s second - largest auto manufacturer , Tata Motors , is set to start producing a four - door known as the one - lakh car — a lakh is a hundred thousand rupees — that will sell for the equivalent of twenty - five hundred dollars . )
Were China and India to increase their rates of car ownership to the point where per-capita oil consumption reached just half of American levels , the two countries would burn through a hundred million additional barrels a day .
( Currently , total global oil use is eighty - six million barrels a day . )
Were they to match U.S. consumption levels , they would require an extra two hundred million barrels a day .
It ’s difficult to imagine how such enormous quantities of oil could be found , but , if they could , the result would be catastrophe .
“ Just consider the scale of the potential problem — for instance , the effect on global warming of seven hundred and fifty million more cars in India and China , belching carbon dioxide , ” Carson and Vaitheeswaran write .
It ’s tough for Americans ( or , in the case of Carson , a Scotsman ) to argue that , for the sake of the planet , citizens in developing countries should n’t buy cars .
It ’s very nearly as tough to imagine Americans deciding , for the sake of the planet , to give up driving .
Since the planet can’t handle ever - increasing numbers of gasoline - consuming , CO 2 - emitting vehicles , it follows , Carson and Vaitheeswaran argue , that a radically new kind of car will have to be invented .
They are n’t particularly clear on how this car will work — they are keen on a number of ( mostly unproved ) technologies — or on who , exactly , will develop it .
But they are convinced that once the right steps are taken — Carson and Vaitheeswaran advocate a stiff carbon tax , and urge Americans to support any politician with the courage to propose such a measure — it will appear .
Indeed , they maintain that the “ race ” to create the “ car of the future ” is already under way .
“ The good news is that a promising suite of technologies — ranging from flex - fuel ethanol engines to plug - in hybrids to hydrogen fuel cells — finally offers a way to move beyond oil and the internal combustion engine , ” Carson and Vaitheeswaran write .
In keeping with their book ’s generally upbeat mood , the two manage to tell the story of the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles as a kind of automotive comedy .
Japanese automakers , excluded from the project , mistakenly took Detroit at its word .
They assumed that the Big Three actually intended to develop super - efficient vehicles , and , to protect themselves , they stepped up their own research efforts .
Within a few years , Honda had introduced the Insight , and Toyota had introduced the Prius ; both got nearly fifty miles to the gallon .
( Carson and Vaitheeswaran are adamant that the Prius is not the car of the future , though they give Toyota high marks for forward thinking . )
The Big Three were then forced to play catch - up : Ford eventually licensed hybrid technology from the Japanese .
However “ the car of the future ” functions , the book predicts that its appearance will transform the American auto industry , either by reinvigorating it or by finally killing it off .
In the words of Lee Iacocca , Carson and Vaitheeswaran urge the Big Three to “ lead , follow , or get out of the way . ”
3 moments in Vista that make me consider Linux While I definitely think some elements of Vista are definite improvements , 10 months of experience has shown me there are some things that just annoy me to my very core .
Here are the three things that most make me wish I had the strength to move over to Linux — full time .
While I definitely think some elements of Vista are definite improvements , 10 months of experience has shown me there are some things that just annoy me to my very core .
Here are the three things that most make me wish I had the strength to move over to Linux — full time .
1. Explorer crashing over and over and over and over and over again
This is a legacy Windows issue that has always plagued me .
Scrolling through huge directories and even just downloading something that Windows does n’t like can cause explorer .
exe to start thinking emo thoughts and take its own life .
While this does n’t usually mean I lose any work , it can frustrate the hell out of me if I ’m doing something with several complicated paths and it means I have to start all over again .
The cause of the above video is a codec issue but my point when I mentioned it was that Explorer , as the shell for Windows , should be nigh on bullet - proof .
Instead we ’ve had 6 major versions of Windows where a squirrel farting 200 miles away can topple it .
2. Included software being criminally rubbish
While there are many examples of this decay in Windows , the CD / DVD burning wizard from XP that has travelled into Vista with just as many issue is the particular example I cite for this claim .
The only magic this wizard has ever shown it transfiguring perfectly good media into little steaming piles of bork .
This is something that should have been fixed in XP SP2 .
As it is in Vista only 1 - in - 10 attempts actually works for me .
To compound my problem and escalate this into a fully - blown issue , the very excellent and free CDBurnerXP does n’t support Vista yet .
This , along with many other small applications included with Windows demonstrate the abuse of time and complacency .
It may work for a small subset of users but the inadequacy of included software drives people to buy 3rd party software to get a relatively simple task accomplished .
Under Linux there is a plethora of highly functional burning apps , some commercial but the best of breed belonging to open source .
FOSS allows people to take existing projects and improve them and while Windows has stagnated , their applications have become wildly powerful and in many cases , best of breed on any platform .
3 . The DRM is getting me down .
While I usually argue that driver - incompatibility is not Microsoft ’s fault due to hardware vendors having access to Vista for well over a year now , plenty of the changes that have had to be made to drivers would n’t be needed if Microsoft had n’t turned Vista into the world ’s biggest software DRM platform .
Vista features layer - upon - layer of hardware and software monitoring so that media apps can " trust " the route through from storage media through to the screen .
If a system cannot be trusted ( through incompatible / untrusted hardware ) the media is distorted into a poorer quality version .
And all this monitoring requires hardware to power it .
Performance that could be used to run the system is being syphoned off to ensure that I ’m not doing something with media I ’m not supposed to .
Microsoft effectively said it was okay to waste the hardware of users on the whim of media companies — something that does n’t sit right by me .
DRM is pointless and ineffective yet some percentage of my system resources are paying that tax regardless of my actions .
And yet I still use it …
For all its faults and shortcomings , I like Windows .
It ’s an unfortunate predicament is n’t it ?
I ’m sure that most of it is experience — knowing where things are — but another large chunk is that I also know the applications I use .
In many circumstances , I know I could migrate to alternative applications on a Linux OS but there are a similar number of applications that I rely on which I deem best of breed .
Some are Microsoft programs like Visual Studio , some are games which do n’t operate under Linux , at least not to the same levels as they work natively in Windows .
The question I keep asking myself as I look jealously at the latest Linux releases is : how long will I force myself to use Windows ?

Ed Rosenthal may have caught a break when Judge Breyer sentenced him to just one day in prison plus time served when he was convicted for growing hundreds of marijuana plants in Oakland , California .
But it would be difficult to argue that his trial was anything short of Kafkaesque .
Rosenthal had been deputized by the City of Oakland to grow medical marijuana .
But after being busted by the Feds , he was not even allowed to mention his relationship to the lawful government of Oakland nor was he allowed to present witnesses who could talk about it .
So after his conviction , Rosenthal took his case to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and won .
His conviction was overturned , but it was overturned on a technicality .
Then , in a clear case of vengeful prosecution , the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California who prosecuted the case decided to bring up charges again , adding new charges to the original .
Again Rosenthal was not allowed to present the obvious defense — his deputization with the City of Oakland — and he was re-convicted .
Before Rosenthal became one of America 's best - known martyrs in the " War on Drugs , " he was legendary for his work advising pot growers on how to produce the finest gourmet cannabis .
His books have included the legendary Marijuana Grower 's Handbook and the recent Big Book of Buds , Vol. 3 .
He wrote the popular " Ask Ed " grower 's advice column for High Times during the 1980s and '90s .
Rosenthal continues to write " Ask Ed " for the Canadian magazine , Cannabis Culture .
I was joined in conducting this interview for the RU Sirius Show by Steve Robles and Jeff DiehlSo how long have you been stoned ?
Well , I only smoke when I 'm alone or with people .
And I only smoke when I 'm awake .
I also do food fasts because , you know , life is speeded up .
So instead of doing a 24 - hour fast , I do , like , 6 hours at a time over a four - day period .
It 's sort of a fast fast .
Let 's talk about your own personal experience with pot .
When 's the first time that you tried it .
How old were you ?
Um , I was ... You ca n't remember !
I was 21 .
What year was it ? ' 65 .
It was weak back then , was it not ?
Yeah , it was .
It was Mexican .
Did you get pretty ripped ?
Do you remember ?
I got stoned enough .
I remember thinking , " This is the greatest thing that ever happened in my life . "
I remember that .
I thought that this was going to be a really powerful ally for me .
And then , years later , I read the Don Juan books , and there it was .
Did you associate pot in 1965 with beat culture ?
Folk music .
And did you think that pot produced insight ?
Why did you like it ?
it was very introspective for me at that time .
So let 's talk about the recent wrinkle in you medical marijuana case .
Why were you re-convicted , and why did n't you present a defense ?
We would 've liked to have presented a defense .
When you 're on trial , you would like to do that .
But the judge said he did n't like our defense .
For instance , we wanted to talk about the prosecutor 's RICO relationship with one of the witnesses .
But we were n't allowed to present any of our defenses .
One by one , the judge said that we could n't present witnesses .
For instance , we wanted to present Nate Miley , who had been a city councilperson in Oakland .
He would 've testified that what I was doing was in line with the city of Oakland 's regulations , and that I had been deputized as a city officer .
I would 've brought in Barbara Parker with the city attorney 's office , and she would 've verified some of those things .
And I would 've brought end users .
You know how prosecutors often bring victims in to court ?
Well , I would 've wanted to bring in the " victims " of my actions .
Those " victims " would 've been the people who actually received either starter plants themselves , or the marijuana that was grown from the starter plants .
But the judge would n't let me do that .
He would n't let me say to the jury that I was an officer of the city of Oakland .
I could n't testify that I had been deputized to do this and that I had been assured that I was free from prosecution .
You mentioned something about the prosecutor having a RICO relationship with one of the witnesses .
What 's that about ?
Well , a prosecutor is allowed to give a witness immunity for things that they 've done .
For instance , if somebody 's killed somebody or committed a robbery or something , often they 'll give one person immunity for ratting on the others .
But a prosecutor is not allowed to give a person immunity for things that they will do in the future .
They can't say , " Okay , this is a pass for killing one person .
You get one free death . "
They can't do that .
So this fellow — Bob Martin — appeared as a witness for the prosecutors and then he continued his medical pot business .
He even opened up a second dispensary .
He was never bothered .
He had a 100,000 square foot grove that was busted by the DEA , but no charges were ever filed .
That happened in 2004 .
So this guy has a free pass .
Basically , each member of this conspiracy was getting something out of it .
My prosecutor , George Beven was getting the information — or so - called information that he wanted .
And Martin , who owns two dispensaries here in San Francisco , got a free pass .
To me , that 's a RICO relationship .
And in this case , we do n't have to show any paperwork , meetings , assignments or anything like that .
We have actions that actually took place .
So I 'm initiating a civil suit against this action because their illegal enterprise has cost me a lot of money .
You know , I was n't allowed to present these facts in either case .
And the jurors were misled , because a half - truth is n't a truth .
A half - truth is a lie .
The jury was told that I had distributed this material , but they did n't hear that I had been told that I was free from prosecution .
That 's an estoppel issue .
Let me explain that .
Let 's say there 's a red light , but a cop waves you through .
Another cop , on the other side , can't give you a ticket for crossing the red light because you have been told that what you 're doing was legal , right ?
You 're following the cop 's orders .
So I was told by the city attorney 's office that what I was doing was legal and I was free from prosecution .
So even if she was wrong , I should 've been able to say to a jury , " Hey , look .
I was led to believe that what I was doing was legal by an official . "
But the judge said , " No .
Even though this person is a government official , she can't testify for you .
" The jury from the first trial was outraged after your conviction when they found out what was actually going on .
That was very unusual .
Describe what happened with the jury after the trial .
( Medical marijuana activist )
Hillary McQuie actually met with the first jury as they came out from the courtroom after the trial .
And she told them that she thought they had made a terrible mistake and that they should look the case up .
They did .
They found out the truth .
They were all dismayed and started calling newspapers .
Eight out of the 12 jurors , plus one of the two alternates agreed that an injustice had been done .
I remember when they were in the news , but I can't remember — did they actually petition the court , or did they release a statement ?
I remember they were active about their unhappiness .
Three of them became activists for a while , and it changed all of their lives .
They learned that they could n't trust the government .
You know , the judge was very upset this time when we said we were n't going to present a defense .
But we said , " We have no witnesses left .
You 've eliminated all our witnesses . "
He looked down at his list and he realized he 'd eliminated everybody except for my wife and myself .
So he said , " Well , I 'll tell you what .
I 'll let you say anything you want to the jury .
I 'll let you talk to the jury , unimpeded .
I 'm not going to say anything to the jury while you 're talking .
I 'm not going to interrupt you . "
And I said , " Okay , that sounds pretty good , but I want corroborating witnesses . "
And he said , " Oh no , I 'm not going to allow you to have your corroborating witnesses . "
I said , " Well , you 're going to allow me to give my theory of the case , but your not allowing me to corroborate it .
This is insane . "
And I basically said that I was not going to play the game in his Stalinist show trial .
I would n't be a part of it .
The entire transcript is online at the Green - Aid website .
Do you think you could 've swayed the jury if you had testified ?
If I had testified and been allowed one witness , that would 've been it .
Without the witnesses , the jury would just think you 're some kind of nutter .
The jury will be sitting there thinking , " Why did n't I hear a witness ?
Why could n't this guy back it up ?
" Well , he could explain that .
Were n't you really able to give your full story , including your objection to ... No , not at all .
And I 'm appealing this .
And anybody who 's listening to this who has $ 100,000 that they 'd like to spend on a court case , just get in touch with Green Aid .
It 's all tax deductible .
Win or lose , this case has made it apparent that the federal laws have to change , and that we need the Peter McWilliams " Truth in Trials " act .
That act would let you use a state medical marijuana law in your defense in a federal case .
It also indicates that the State of California has to start protecting the providers , because there are now over 100 providers who have been arrested and charged .
Dozens are in jail and there are over 100 under indictment right now .
And the only difference between them and me is that I 'm a little more notorious or famous , and I have perhaps a little more media savvy than they do .
Most of them are going to wind up doing time .
And very often they say to the person who runs the medical marijuana operation , " If you do n't plead to a long term , we 're going to take all your workers and give them each five years .
" What is the next stage of your appeal ?
Where does it go ?
We 're preparing our appeal to the 9th Circuit .
You already went through the 9th Circuit once , did n't you ?
Yeah .
We 're asking for a new trial , and if not , we 're appealing .
We have a number of new grounds to appeal .
I mean , these colloquies that I had with the judge were very unusual .
You would n't believe what our conversations were .
And they 're all on transcript .
It 's the same judge again ?
It 's the same judge .
And , you know , people think he 's a really nice guy because he only sentenced me to a day .
But first , he took away my constitutional rights .
And he only gave me a day because it was well publicized and it was looking really bad .
But he regularly gives people five years , ten years , seven years , all the time .
And he has a reputation for not letting defenses prove their cases .
In going before the 9th Circuit court before , you got the case thrown out but it was basically on a technicality .
You did n't really accomplish a mission in terms of having a positive effect on people who grown medical marijuana .
Do you have an approach for trying to have an effect the next time you go before the 9th Circuit ?
Winning .
But win or lose , I think that the policies are going to change , because the state is going to realize that they have to intervene .
And also , there 's more impetus for the Peter McWilliams " Truth in Trials " act .
Is this something that 's before the House of Representatives ?
Yes .
How could California be counted on now to confront the U.S. Government ?
Schwarzenegger , who sort of played at being libertarian on his way into the governorship , has been a drug warrior through and through since he 's been in office .
Well , he 's been trying to free himself from the power of the Corrections Department bureaucracy and the prison guards union .
And he 's found out that he can't do it .
Right .
That group basically owned Gray Davis .
The Democrats have to get away from that .
And there are incremental steps the system can take .
For instance , police need to continually get credits for learning new techniques and stuff like that .
One of the places where they can get this credit is through the California Narcotics Officers Association .
So they pay for these courses where they 're miseducated .
Right on the homepage of the CNOA website , it says , " We believe medical marijuana is a myth . "
That 's what they teach officers .
These are people who are supposed to be enforcing California law , which approves medical marijuana .
Other things need to change , For instance , in Oakland , the local narcotics officers work out of the DEA office in the Federal Building .
They 're cross-deputized .
They 're paid by the city , but they also function as a federal official .
So the city needs to keep them separate .
Some activists think that one of the big problems is Proposition 215 .
People think it 's a hastily put - together proposition .
It 's swiss cheese — full of holes .
They think the state needs to pass something a lot more substantive .
I do n't really think that 's the issue .
Look , marijuana is more popular than any politician .
It wins by a higher percentage than politicians do .
I 'll give you an example .
Bush won in Montana in 2004 .
But marijuana won there by a much higher margin than he did .
People are getting stoned and voting for Bush !
So there 's a disconnect between the politicians and the voters on this .
And the voters consistently say , " We do want these dispensaries .
We want easy access . "
But the politicians are in the hands of the criminal justice system — the cops , the judges , the prosecutors .
It ’s such a big financial interest that nobody wants to let it go .
We now spend more on jails than on higher education .
We have a thousand people in California prisons for marijuana .
My suggestion is that we take this on a very local level – at the level of the councilperson .
It 's got to be city - by - city and they 've got to push back the police .
Do you remember when Proposition 36 passed ?
Right .
The idea was that people should n't go to jail for drug possession .
Right — not for the first or second offense .
So it passed , but then – first of all , the criminal justice establishment wanted to tighten it up .
And if you go online and find all the arguments against it , they 're all from people who are part of the criminal justice system .
See — if marijuana was legal and other drugs were treated with a harm reduction strategy , a huge bureaucracy would be eliminated – and a lot of jobs .
There are 750,000 arrests a year for marijuana in the U.S. 88 % of those are for personal use .
That 's about 5 % of the entire criminal justice arrests throughout the United States .
And it 's an upward funnel , because when you get to second and third offenses , the sentencing for marijuana is much higher than the sentencing for violent offenses .
So you have people spending more time in prison .
Also , when they get out , they need social services , another bureaucracy .
But does n't this all have to be changed through the federal government , since they come in and shut down local medical marijuana and so forth ?
And if pot is more popular than politicians , why do n't people make the politicians take their side ?
It 's not necessarily a primary issue with most voters .
Also , the criminal justice system can provide a potent opposition to politicians .
If the Police Benevolent Association and the local police union says the politician is " soft on crime , " that can be trouble .
So a lot of politicians are cowed .
You wind up with people like Judge Breyer .
Breyer knows that pot is n't a harmful substance , but he sentences people to prison for it .
He 's a war criminal !
When you send somebody to prison , it does n't just affect them .
It affects their families .
It affects their employers or employees .
A whole community of people is affected .
These are acts of destruction that are woven so deeply into the system that people do n't even see them as being acts of destruction .
Yeah !
I do n't know if you heard about some of my antics , but outside the courtroom I would say nasty things to the prosecutor .
For instance , I called him a liar , because the judge found that he lied to the grand jury ( but said no harm had been done ) .
I called him vindictive .
I called him a coward .
So he went and complained to the judge about it .
And the judge said , " Well , we all should be very civil and polite here . "
Meanwhile , they 're putting one person after another in jail for providing people with marijuana .
It 's outrageous !
How can they say that ?
So the judge talked to my lawyer and said , " Can you try and control your client ? "
And my lawyer said to him , " Well , judge — perhaps it 's my fault .
I did advise him not to say anything nasty in the courtroom .
But I did n't say anything about the hallway . "
So the judge said , " Oh , well , please speak with Mr. Rosenthal about this . "
But he also said something like : " This is in a federal building , but we may have First Amendment issues . "
So after this exchange , I went up to the microphone at the podium , unasked , and I said , " Your honor , I 'd like to thank you for protecting my First Amendment right to call this man a coward , a liar , and vindictive .
But I left something out .
He 's also a tattle - tale and a cry baby .
" Does the " three strikes " law relate to these two marijuana convictions ?
I now have three non-violent felony strikes .
You get into a fight with me ; I 'm away for life .
All right , so , be gentle with me , man .
Keep away from Terence Hallinan ( ed : Rowdy pro-pot former DA of San Francisco . ) because that guy 's a maniac .
So a lot of people think there are no consequences for you because the judge only sentenced you to one day .
But all those felonies – those are big consequences .
On your site , there 's a mention that you might be working on a book about pot legalization .
What 's your favorite method of legal distribution ?
Do you think it should be any way people want ?
Or should it be in specialty shops or liquor stores ?
Or should it be only homegrown ?
Do you have a favorite procedure for doing it ?
I see the tomato model .
Let me explain .
Home gardeners grow more tomatoes than are grown commercially .
But there 's also a gigantic commercial market for tomatoes .
Some of them are served in restaurants .
Some of them are canned , dried , served in different ways .
So there are lots of different commercial ways that tomatoes are distributed .
I see something like that .
I do n't think that it 's ever going to be restriction - free .
I think that there 's going to be the same kind of civil regulation that we have with alcohol and tobacco .
There are going to be taxes on it .
But I think that many more people are going to grow their own than make their own beer or wine or grow their own tobacco .
I think people are going to have all of those models .
In terms of buying product , I think it 'll mainly be through specialty shops .
So , how soon ?
Well , in Oakland , we have Prop Z , which says that it should be able to be sold in private clubs .
In California , within 5 - 7 years .
Before I let you go , tell us about your new book , The Big Book of Buds , Vol. 3 .
You told us you have some new information in there .
I have a piece in their about terpenes .
Terpenes are the odor parts of flowers .
Almost all flowers that produce odors have terpenes .
It 's four simple molecules , but there 's a lot going on in the way they 're assembled – like with DNA .
So the structure of assembly of the terpenes creates all the different odors .
So I used to say that the reason why different marijuanas give you different highs is because they have different recipes of cannabinoids – somehow one will have a little more CBD or a little more CBL or other cannabinoids .
But it 's been shown that most modern marijuana has a big spike of THC and hardly any other cannabinoids .
So the question is : what else causes different types of marijuana to give you different highs ?
It comes down to the terpenes .
And it's in the odor qualities of cannabis .

Radley Balko pointed out on The Agitator that the Lima , Ohio , SWAT team 's web site had an animated gif on it which seemed to fire into the faces of web site visitors : Check out Google 's cached copy of the page here to see it in context .
Since they killed 26 - year - old Tarika Wilson , an innocent mother of six , and maimed her youngest son , a one - year - old , they 've taken the violent image off of the site , though .
It 's not hard to see why they " went in shooting " to her home , as Wilson 's sister described it .
A policing , SWAT team culture that would allow such an image to go on their own official home page , is a culture that is simply prone to reckless , " cowboy " behavior .
Frankly , it seems like they were having a little too much fun being a SWAT team .
As the saying goes , " it 's all fun and games until someone loses an eye . "
This time it was a life that was lost , and a child 's finger .
But it was never fun for the people on the other end .
According to the web page , the Lima SWAT team conducts about 50 raids a year , about once a week .
I looked up the city 's population to try and get a sense of how much that is , and it's a mere 38,219 ( estimate July ' 06 ) .
That 's bigger than Mayberry , but it 's not a metropolis by any means .
So I think that one SWAT raid a week there is a huge number .
One would think one was living in Baghdad , for such extreme measures to be used once a week in a jurisdiction that size .
The page says that most of the raids were on crack houses .
There 's the explanation -- they are using the SWAT team not for the extreme or emergency situations that SWAT is meant for , but on routine drug enforcement .
The federal government is probably funding them on a per-arrest basis .
I can't imagine it 's pleasant to live near a crack house .
But the overwhelming majority of crack houses do n't have drug kingpins or terrorists hiding in them .
The appropriate approach is to knock and announce , wait an appropriate amount of time , and then if the door has n't been opened , to force it open but to do so cautiously .
( Actually the appropriate approach is to put the crack houses out of business through legalization , but that 's another issue . )
Drug dealers are not in the business to kill cops and become the most hunted fugitives on the planet .
Drug dealers are trying to make money .
Police do n't need to enter in dramatic and sudden force to protect their lives .
The dealers are n't going to shoot them , they 're going to try to disappear or hide or dispose of the evidence .
Last year we looked into police officer fatalities doing drug enforcement , and out of two million drug arrests per year we could only find four of them in all of 2006 , with only two of those directly related to drug arrests .
In the rare situations when you need a SWAT team , it 's important that it be there for you .
Lima 's almost two hours from the nearest big city , Columbus , so maybe they should have their own .
But I can only say maybe , partly because there would be at least one more living person in Lima now if they did n't .
They certainly should n't be using it 50 times a year .
PLEASE SIGN OUR PETITION TO STOP THE DEADLY SWAT RAIDS .
American researchers have stunned the world with the revelation that young people who drink a lot tend to get more sex .
Academics at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis revealed their shock findings yesterday after extensive research .
It seems that the shrinks were easily able to demonstrate a connection between heavy drinking ( according to their definition of heavy drinking ) and unhealthily large amounts of nookie ( according to their hastily - revised personal definition thereof ) .
" To my knowledge , most research in young adults has used a standard of ' up to six ' sex partners when examining risk , " said Patricia Cavazos - Rehg , PhD .
" But the average number of partners for the people in this study was 9.26 . "
Hastily making the unilateral decision that ten or more partners now constitutes " high risk " , the psych doc and her envious crew ploughed on .
Sadly , the po-faced psychs seemed unaware of the feelgood implications of their research , seeking to imply that anyone scoring above one or two was some kind of diseased orgiastic slut .
" The more sex partners you have , the more likely you 'll encounter someone with an STD , " said Cavazos - Rehg , further burnishing her already dazzling credentials in the bleeding - obvious area of human knowledge .
" Chances also increase for unintended pregnancies and other health complications , " she added , thus - to her own satisfaction - proving that a " high " number of sexual partners is a bad thing .
( You just knew this study was n't going to say anything like " Hey , well done young people !
You 're getting more action than I ever did !
Props ! " )
Apparently the researchers conducted " personal " interviews with 601 youngsters aged 18 - 25 .
To give the research the necessary doleful slant , all 601 were chosen from among relatives of known alcoholics .
They concluded that " alcohol - dependent individuals ... are at risk for increased number of sexual partners ( ten or more ) . "
( " At risk " ? )
This research does seem to tell us one thing with certainty .
If you 're a grad student on the psych faculty at Washington University , you do n't admit to having had more than five sexual partners .
In fact , this kind of " research " seems to fall more under the heading of " subjective morality " or even " jealousy " than anything else .
Also , based on their notion of what constitutes a " high " number of sexual partners , we 're guessing that the Washington U crowd will file you under ' alcohol - dependent ' as soon as you order your second half of mild .
Meanwhile , for all the normal people , you heard it here first : drinking will get you laid .
The release is here and the abstract is here . ®
Tony Blair has launched a powerful attack on ' absurd ' British Islamists who have nurtured a false ' sense of grievance ' that they are being oppressed by Britain and the United States .
In his most outspoken remarks on Islamists , the former Prime Minister warns that Britain is in danger of losing the battle against terrorists unless mainstream society confronts the threat .
Blair 's remarks , in which he also attacks some civil liberty campaigners as ' loopy loo ' , were made in a Channel 4 documentary recorded last Tuesday on the eve of his departure from Downing Street .
' The idea that as a Muslim in this country that you do n't have the freedom to express your religion or your views , I mean you 've got far more freedom in this country than you do in most Muslim countries , ' Blair told Observer columnist Will Hutton , who presents the documentary .
' The reason we are finding it hard to win this battle is that we 're not actually fighting it properly .
We 're not actually standing up to these people and saying , " It 's not just your methods that are wrong , your ideas are absurd .
Nobody is oppressing you .
Your sense of grievance is n't justified . " '
Blair held out the example of the overthrow of the Taliban in Afghanistan - criticised by Islamists as an example of the heavy - handed imperial West oppressing Muslims - to highlight unfounded claims of grievance .
He asked how it is possible to claim that Afghanistan 's Muslims are being oppressed when the Taliban 'used to execute teachers for teaching girls in schools ' .
Blair added : ' How are [ we ] oppressing them ?
You 're oppressing them when you support the people who are trying to blow them up . '
Blair , who normally chooses his language carefully when he talks about Islamists , also takes a swipe at critics who accused him of undermining civil liberties .
' When I 'm trying to change the law in order to make it easier to deport people who engage in terrorism - the idea that that 's an assault on hundreds of years of British civil liberties is completely absurd .
Some of what is written on this is loopy - loo in its extremism . '
· The Last Days of Tony Blair will be shown on Channel Four at 8 pm tomorrow
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A quarter of Blackwater security guards in Iraq use steroids and other " judgment - altering substances , " according to a lawsuit filed by the families of several Iraqis killed or wounded in a Baghdad shooting in September .
A car burned in the September 16 Blackwater incident sits on a Baghdad street a week later .
Blackwater denies the charges .
The suit , filed Monday in Washington , accuses the company of fostering " a culture of lawlessness " among its guards and says the use of excessive force helps the company preserve a key selling point -- the fact that none of its protectees have been killed during the four - year - old war .
" I think there is a whole corporate culture there that essentially rewards the use of excessive force -- shooting first , asking questions later , " said Susan Burke , the lead attorney in the case .
The lawsuit accuses Blackwater of war crimes , wrongful death , assault , negligent hiring and emotional distress .
The plaintiffs include two wounded survivors of the September 16 shootings around Nusoor Square , in western Baghdad , and the families of five people killed in the incident .
Iraqi authorities say the guards killed 17 people in an act of " premeditated murder . "
Blackwater has denied any wrongdoing , arguing its contractors used necessary force to protect a State Department convoy that came under fire from insurgents .
Watch report on steroid allegations »
The lawsuit accuses Blackwater of failing to control the use of steroids among its guards -- an allegation Burke said came from " people in that community , " and one she said would be backed up as the case progresses .
" The reality is that Blackwater has indeed fired people for steroid use , so they 're on clear notice that there 's steroid use , " Burke said .
She said Blackwater has marketed the idea " that their people are kind of tougher and bigger than anybody else , " and has turned a blind eye toward " serious , repeated situations of excessive use of force . "
Blackwater spokeswoman Anne Tyrrell rejected the steroid allegations , saying all company workers face drug tests during their application process and on a quarterly basis while working for the firm .
" Steroids and performance enhancement drugs , both illegal and prescribed , are absolutely in violation of our policy , " Tyrrell told CNN .
" Blackwater has very strict policies concerning drug use , and if anyone were known to be using illegal drugs , they would be fired immediately . "
The lawsuit states that the guards involved in the September 16 killings violated orders from their Baghdad supervisors by leaving a secure area where they had dropped off a State Department official under their protection .
The guards opened fire " without provocation , " the suit states , and continued firing even after one of their comrades tried to stop them from shooting .
The lawsuit also accuses the North Carolina - based military contractor of hiring ex-Chilean commandos who were barred from security or military work in their home country after admitting to human rights violations , and of hiring mercenaries -- a term the company rejects -- from a variety of countries .
The U.S. government has paid the company nearly $ 1 billion for diplomatic security since the invasion of Iraq , a House committee reported in September .
The Nusoor Square killings spurred Iraqi threats to bar the company from operating in Iraq and a push to lift the legal immunity conferred on contractors by the U.S. - led occupation government in 2004 .
The lawsuit does not request a specific amount in damages , but Burke said her clients want both compensation for their own losses and punitive damages against the firm " for having failed to take the reasonable and adequate corporate steps that they should have taken ages ago . "
" Blackwater encourages and fosters a culture of lawlessness amongst its employees , encouraging them to act in the company 's financial interest at the expense of innocent human life , " the lawsuit says .

What are the chances of one succeeding with moonlighting ?
November 16 , 2007 at 7:56 am | Posted in Uncategorized | 9 Comments
Tags : , moonlighting , startup
Well it depends on situation .
Let me tell you some upsides and downsides so you can judge yourself .
I and two of my friends have been working on this Onista Project for a while now .
All 3 of us have full time jobs and we are working on Onista development mostly during evenings and weekends .
It has been challenging and at the same time very interesting journey .
During this period we have learned lots of new things and I feel that we are getting quite good at moonlighting .
Let me explain some of the advantages and disadvantages of moonlighting .
Let ’s look at some of the downsides of moonlighting first ,
There is never enough time to do things .
This causes long application development cycle and pretty much delays all of your plans .
If you think something will take 4 weeks to launch , I think you can safely multiply that 4 weeks with 3 x .
That is certainly happening to us .
You are always behind the schedule .
This is direct effect of the fact that you do not have enough time to spend on your startup .
Fortunately you are defining your own schedules and there is no one to kick your arse if you do n’t meet the schedule
People tend to show less interest in your startup because you are working on it on part - time basis .
It is a general perception that “ They are doing SOMETHING on the side ” .
No one really takes interest to understand what that SOMETHING is .
In a way it protects your idea if you like to hide it
You are overworked and can not spend enough time with family .
Yes this is big issue .
Imagine working on your day job from 9 - 7 and then coming home and again working until 3 AM .
Weekends are completely taken by startup .
Pretty much no time for family .
This one is very tricky to handle .
God bless you with this one
Your social life does not exist .
Simply no time for friends and social activities
Now let ’s take a look at some of the upsides ,
You can fund your own startup .
Actually this is the major reason I personally prefer moonlighting because we do not need to go and ask for money to someone else .
In our case we raised much more money “ in one day ” than what YC invests by ourselves putting money in company .
Heck if you are making good money then might as well use that money for your own startup .
There is pretty much never ending pool of funds and I love this fact
You tend to utilize your time and energy on important things .
Now given that you do not have lot of time , you will get pretty good at focusing on important stuff
You will not hop from one idea to another .
Again , since you do not have lot of time to hop on ideas you will take one idea seriously and end up devoting yourself to that one until your users reject your app
There are less fights among founders .
There is just no time to fight .
Trust me .
In our case , we meet like once or twice a week .
We assign tasks ( to each other ) for coming week and then we work from home on those tasks .
We mostly communicate over IM , email or phone and none of those are good mediums to fight anyway
If you love coding then you can enjoy it 24/7
Since you are always making money , even if your current startup fails you will still have ongoing funding for your next startup
You do not need to give any equity to anyone for amount like 20 k .
I mean come on , that is such a small investment to give any equity away .
( I am not talking about YC money here because I know that getting money from YC is much more than just money and I really respect Paul for what he has been doing )
You do not actually need any office space or incubator
You get very good at defining requirements and getting those done on rentacoder or elance .
There are always those small pieces of work ( like repetitive testing ) that no one in your team enjoys doing can be simply get done on rentacoder or elance
No one is going to kick you because your took money from them for your FAILED startup .
No one even cares if your startup fails
You have freedom to define your rules and game because you did not take money from anyone else
So I think in our situation moonlighting is working pretty well and all of us are adjusted well enough to the situation now .
Do n’t take me wrong though .
We do want to go full - time on this startup as soon as we can , but I think we can manage with moonlighting and we prefer doing it to keep funding our startup ourselves for now .
I seriously mean “ for now ” here because things can change anytime .
I know that there are lots of people out there who have full time jobs and desire to start a startup but can not do so because your family depends on your paycheck .
I really suggest moonlighting as an good alternative to those folks who are not fortunate enough to quit jobs and yet have strong passion for startups .
As I listed , there are some disadvantages and yet there are lots of advantages too .
So go for it .
Good luck .
FOR as long as most people can remember , food has been getting cheaper and farming has been in decline .
In 1974 - 2005 food prices on world markets fell by three - quarters in real terms .
Food today is so cheap that the West is battling gluttony even as it scrapes piles of half - eaten leftovers into the bin .
That is why this year 's price rise has been so extraordinary .
Since the spring , wheat prices have doubled and almost every crop under the sun— maize , milk , oilseeds , you name it — is at or near a peak in nominal terms .
The Economist 's food - price index is higher today than at any time since it was created in 1845 ( see chart ) .
Even in real terms , prices have jumped by 75 % since 2005 .
No doubt farmers will meet higher prices with investment and more production , but dearer food is likely to persist for years ( see article ) .
That is because “ agflation ” is underpinned by long - running changes in diet that accompany the growing wealth of emerging economies — the Chinese consumer who ate 20kg ( 44lb ) of meat in 1985 will scoff over 50kg of the stuff this year .
That in turn pushes up demand for grain : it takes 8 kg of grain to produce one of beef .
But the rise in prices is also the self - inflicted result of America 's reckless ethanol subsidies .
This year biofuels will take a third of America 's ( record ) maize harvest .
That affects food markets directly : fill up an SUV's fuel tank with ethanol and you have used enough maize to feed a person for a year .
And it affects them indirectly , as farmers switch to maize from other crops .
The 30 m tonnes of extra maize going to ethanol this year amounts to half the fall in the world 's overall grain stocks .
Dearer food has the capacity to do enormous good and enormous harm .
It will hurt urban consumers , especially in poor countries , by increasing the price of what is already the most expensive item in their household budgets .
It will benefit farmers and agricultural communities by increasing the rewards of their labour ; in many poor rural places it will boost the most important source of jobs and economic growth .
Although the cost of food is determined by fundamental patterns of demand and supply , the balance between good and ill also depends in part on governments .
If politicians do nothing , or the wrong things , the world faces more misery , especially among the urban poor .
If they get policy right , they can help increase the wealth of the poorest nations , aid the rural poor , rescue farming from subsidies and neglect — and minimise the harm to the slum - dwellers and landless labourers .
So far , the auguries look gloomy .
In the trough
That , at least , is the lesson of half a century of food policy .
Whatever the supposed threat — the lack of food security , rural poverty , environmental stewardship — the world seems to have only one solution : government intervention .
Most of the subsidies and trade barriers have come at a huge cost .
The trillions of dollars spent supporting farmers in rich countries have led to higher taxes , worse food , intensively farmed monocultures , overproduction and world prices that wreck the lives of poor farmers in the emerging markets .
And for what ?
Despite the help , plenty of Western farmers have been beset by poverty .
Increasing productivity means you need fewer farmers , which steadily drives the least efficient off the land .
Even a vast subsidy cannot reverse that .
With agflation , policy has reached a new level of self - parody .
Take America 's supposedly verdant ethanol subsidies .
It is not just that they are supporting a relatively dirty version of ethanol ( far better to import Brazil 's sugar - based liquor ) ; they are also offsetting older grain subsidies that lowered prices by encouraging overproduction .
Intervention multiplies like lies .
Now countries such as Russia and Venezuela have imposed price controls — an aid to consumers — to offset America 's aid to ethanol producers .
Meanwhile , high grain prices are persuading people to clear forests to plant more maize .
Dearer food is a chance to break this dizzying cycle .
Higher market prices make it possible to reduce subsidies without hurting incomes .
A farm bill is now going through America 's Congress .
The European Union has promised a root - and - branch review ( not yet reform ) of its farm - support scheme .
The reforms of the past few decades have , in fact , grappled with the rich world 's farm programmes — but only timidly .
Now comes the chance for politicians to show that they are serious when they say they want to put agriculture right .
Cutting rich - world subsidies and trade barriers would help taxpayers ; it could revive the stalled Doha round of world trade talks , boosting the world economy ; and , most important , it would directly help many of the world 's poor .
In terms of economic policy , it is hard to think of a greater good .
Where government help is really needed
Three - quarters of the world 's poor live in rural areas .
The depressed world prices created by farm policies over the past few decades have had a devastating effect .
There has been a long - term fall in investment in farming and the things that sustain it , such as irrigation .
The share of public spending going to agriculture in developing countries has fallen by half since 1980 .
Poor countries that used to export food now import it .
Reducing subsidies in the West would help reverse this .
The World Bank reckons that if you free up agricultural trade , the prices of things poor countries specialise in ( like cotton ) would rise and developing countries would capture the gains by increasing exports .
And because farming accounts for two - thirds of jobs in the poorest countries , it is the most important contributor to the early stages of economic growth .
According to the World Bank , the really poor get three times as much extra income from an increase in farm productivity as from the same gain in industry or services .
In the long term , thriving farms and open markets provide a secure food supply .
However , there is an obvious catch — and one that justifies government help .
High prices have a mixed impact on poverty : they hurt anyone who loses more from dear food than he gains from a higher income .
And that means over a billion urban consumers ( and some landless labourers ) , many of whom are politically influential in poor countries .
Given the speed of this year 's food - price rises , governments in emerging markets have no alternative but to try to soften the blow .
Where they can , these governments should subsidise the incomes of the poor , rather than food itself , because that minimises price distortions .
Where food subsidies are unavoidable , they should be temporary and targeted on the poor .
So far , most government interventions in the poor world have failed these tests : politicians who seem to think cheap food part of the natural order of things have slapped on price controls and export restraints , which hurt farmers and will almost certainly fail .
Over the past few years , a sense has grown that the rich are hogging the world 's wealth .
In poor countries , widening income inequality takes the form of a gap between city and country : incomes have been rising faster for urban dwellers than for rural ones .
If handled properly , dearer food is a once - in - a - generation chance to narrow income disparities and to wean rich farmers from subsidies and help poor ones .
The ultimate reward , though , is not merely theirs : it is to make the world richer and fairer .
The daily rituals I described yesterday can also be done with Planner , another personal information manager for Emacs .
In fact , I spent about four years managing my tasks using Planner before I tried out Org .
My process then was similar to my Org process now in that I wrote the tasks down before I tried to organize or do them , and I built in some time for a review .
The difference was that I did n’t organize most of my tasks into separate projects ( or plan pages , as Planner calls them ) .
Instead , I tended to organize them according to day .
This was helpful when publishing my blog , as I could post my task list along with it .
I also liked the greater control I had over my daily task list , and I often used blank lines or extra notes to keep things organized .
The core of the process was the same , though :
Get the tasks out of your head .
Schedule the tasks .
Do the tasks .
Review the tasks .
Get the tasks out of your head
The first thing I did each day was to put all of my tasks into my
Planner .
I briefly scanned through my mail looking for action items ,
and whenever I found something I needed to do that would take more
than two minutes , I created a task for it using
planner - create - task - from - buffer .
This automatically created a
hyperlink back to the e-mail or file I was reading , and included
useful information such as the e-mail author .
I treated appointments just like tasks , although I added a timestamp
like @ 13:00 to make it easier to see and sort my appointments .
planner - create - task - from - buffer helped me keep track of reactive
tasks , or things that I needed to do because someone else asked me to
do them .
However , I also made a point of reviewing my goals and making
up my own tasks so that I could work on my personal projects .
For
example , I had a plan page where I put all my writing ideas , and I
added those tasks to today ’s page once in a while .
I also scanned the last few day pages to see if I ’d missed anything ,
and the next few days to see if I needed to plan for anything .
Although the M-x plan command automatically brings tasks forward , I
did n’t use it to start my day .
Instead , I reviewed the last three days
or so , marking tasks that I ’d completed but not updated , cancelling
tasks I no longer wanted or needed to do , and rescheduling other tasks
forward using C -c C-c ( planner - copy - or - move - task ) .
I also reviewed the
next three days or so .
C-c C-j C-y ( planner - goto - yesterday ) and C - c
C-j C-t ( planner - goto - tomorrow ) were handy for flipping through pages .
To make the shortcuts shorter and more natural , I bound them to F9 F8
and F9 F10 with :
( global - set - key ( kbd " < f9 > < f8 > " ) ' planner - goto- yesterday ) ( global - set - key ( kbd " < f9 > < f10 > " ) ' planner-goto-tomorrow )
At the end of this step , I had all the things I needed to do scheduled
for today .
So the first thing you need to do is get used to creating tasks
quickly .
Get them out of your head and into Planner , where you can
then schedule , organize , act on , and review them .
You can bind
planner - create - task - from - buffer to a convenient shortcut key such as
C-c t SPC by using the following code in your ~/.emacs :
( global - set - key ( kbd " C- c t SPC " ) ' planner-create-task -from - buffer )
By default , planner - create - task - from - buffer asks you for a date and a
plan page when you create tasks .
You can either slow down and think
about this , hit RET twice to accept the defaults , or modify Planner so
that it does n’t prompt you at all .
Being lazy , I chose to let Planner
put all the tasks on today ’s page and a copy on the TaskPool plan page
for backup .
If I knew I had to do something on a specific date , I
could tell it to prompt for the date by using the prefix argument ( C-u
before the command ) .
Here ’s the code that makes that happen :
( defun sacha / planner - read - task () " Do not prompt for date unless the prefix argument is given . " ( let ( ( planner - expand - name - favor - future - p t ) ) ( list ( read - string " Describe task : " ) ( if current - prefix - arg ( planner - read - date ) ( planner - today ) ) " TaskPool " planner - default - task - status ) ) ) ( defalias ' planner-read- task ' sacha/planner-read- task )
Organize the tasks
Getting the tasks out of my head often resulted in a long list of
tasks , not all of which I needed to do or could even do that day .
Then
it was time to ruthlessly use C -c C-c ( planner - copy - or - move - task ) and
M-x planner - copy - or - move - region to trim my task list down to a
manageable size .
I moved tasks that did n’t need to be done on a
certain date to the TaskPool , which I checked whenever I had some free
time .
If I wanted to assign a task to a specific time , I just added a
timestamp such as @ 14:30 to the task .
I had some code which
automatically sorted the tasks by time , so it would go to the right
place .
I also used M-down and M-up ( planner - lower - task and
planner - raise - task ) to move tasks around .
To visually group tasks , I
added blank lines and explanatory text .
For example , I put errands
together and I moved the tasks up and down into a logical order for
doing things .
If there were a lot of small items in my day , I also separated the
“ must - be - dones ” from the “ nice - to - dos ” .
This was n’t related to the
importance of the task , just the urgency .
Urgent items went in the
first group , and non-urgent items went in the second group of tasks .
At the end of this step , I had a daily plan page which showed me my
tasks and appointments for the day , in the rough order in which I
planned to do them .
I also had some tasks on future days , and some
tasks in my TaskPool .
Do the tasks
Now that all my tasks were on the page , it was easy to go through
them .
To start working on a task , I marked it as in - progress with C -
c
C-i ( planner - task - in- progress ) .
If I needed to postpone it , I used C- c
C-p ( planner - task - pending ) .
To mark it finished , I used C- c C-x
( planner - task - done ) .
To mark it cancelled , I used C- c C- S-x
( planner - task - cancelled ; does not work in some terminals ) .
Because I had loaded planner - timeclock.el using code like this :
( require ' planner-timeclock )
the clock automatically started when I marked tasks as in - progress and stopped when I marked tasks as pending or done .
I could also clock out of a task manually by using C -c C-o ( timeclock - out ) .
Review the tasks
To review what I did that day , all I had to do was go to the day page using planner - goto - today , which I bound to F9 F9 with :
( global - set - key ( kbd " < f9 > < f9 > " ) ' planner-goto- today )
I checked my timeclock reports with M-x planner - timeclock - summary - show , which gave me reports that looked like this :
Timeclock summary report for 2007.11.25 Project | Time | Ratio | Task Not Planned | 0:28:38 | 38.6 % | Do weekly review .
| 0:45:37 | 61.4 % | Figure out how to set up syndicated blog on WordPress Total : | 1:14:15 | 100.0 % | .
Day began : 21:01:20 , Day ended : 22:16:06
Time elapsed : 1:14:46 , Time clocked : 1:14:15 Time clocked ratio : 99.3 %
It ’s easy to configure planner - timeclock - summary to add that report to
day pages automatically , but I rarely checked my time usage then , so I
did n’t set that up .
I also did n’t usually need to see my time summary
for a particular project , but you could get that with
planner - timeclock - summary - proj.el .
So at the end of this step , I had a warm and fuzzy feeling from seeing
many checked - off tasks on my task list .
I published my task list to
the Net , too , which made it easy for other people to keep up to date
with what I was doing .
Good stuff .
Planner helped me keep track of the different things I wanted to do .
Working with the other Planner geeks was also an incredible
experience .
I ’ve switched to Org for my task management because Org
does timeclocking better , but I still miss being able to easily
organize , publish , and tweak my daily task list . =)
If you ’re new to Emacs planning , I suggest giving both OrgMode and PlannerMode a try !

There are thirteen vitamins humans need for growth and development and to maintain good health .
The human body cannot make these essential bio-molecules .
They must be supplied in the diet or by bacteria in the intestine , except for vitamin D. Skin makes vitamin D when exposed to ultraviolet B ( UVB ) radiation from the sun .
A light - skinned person will synthesize 20,000 IU ( international units ) of vitamin D in 20 minutes sunbathing on a Caribbean beach .
Vitamin D is also unique in another way .
It is the only vitamin that is a hormone , a type of steroid hormone known as a secosteroid , with three carbon rings .
Steroid hormones such as cortisone , estrogen , and testosterone have four carbon rings .
Ultraviolet B radiation in sunlight breaks open one of the rings in a steroid alcohol present in the skin , 7 - dehydrocholesterol , to form vitamin D ( cholecalciferol ) .
The liver changes this molecule into its circulating form , 25 - hydroxyvitamin D ( calcidiol , 25 [ OH] D ) , the " vitamin D " blood tests measure .
Cells throughout the body absorb 25 - hydroxyvitamin D and change it into 1,25 - dihydroxyvitamin D ( calcitriol ) , the active form of vitamin D that attaches directly to receptors on the DNA of genes in the cell 's nucleus .
The vitamin D hormone system controls the expression of more than 200 genes and the proteins they produce .
In addition to its well - known role in calcium metabolism , vitamin D activates genes that control cell growth and programmed cell death ( apoptosis ) , express mediators that regulate the immune system , and release neurotransmitters ( e.g. , serotonin ) that influence one 's mental state .
Severe deficiencies of some vitamins cause vitamin - specific diseases , such as beriberi ( from a lack of vitamin B1 , thiamine ) , pellagra ( B3 , niacin ) , pernicious anemia ( B12 ) , and scurvy , ( vitamin C ) .
A deficiency in iodine produces a goiter , mental retardation , and , when severe , cretinism .

Rickets , a softening and bending of bones in children , first described in 1651 , is another nutritionally - specific disease .
It reached epidemic proportions following the industrial revolution , which began in the 1750s .
In the 19th century , before the importance of exposing children to sunlight was recognized , the majority of children that lived in cities with sunless , narrow alleyways and pollution developed rickets .
An autopsy study done in Boston in the late 1800s showed that more than 80 percent of children had rickets .
Early in the 20th century an investigator found that cod liver oil could prevent rickets in puppies .
The nutritional factor in the oil that promotes skeletal calcium deposition was named " vitamin D , " alphabetically after already - named vitamins A , B , and C. Rickets was thought to be another vitamin - deficiency disease , and the curative agent , a steroid hormone , was mislabeled a " vitamin . "
Now , a century later , a wealth of evidence suggests that rickets , its most florid manifestation , is the tip of a vitamin D insufficiency / deficiency iceberg .
A lack of Vitamin D can also trigger infections ( influenza and tuberculosis ) , autoimmune diseases ( multiple sclerosis , Type 1 diabetes , rheumatoid arthritis , and inflammatory bowel disease ) , cardiovascular disease , and cancer .
Practitioners of conventional medicine ( i.e. , most MDs ) are just beginning to appreciate the true impact of vitamin D deficiency .
In 1990 , medical journals published less than 20 reviews and editorials on vitamin D. Last year they published more than 300 reviews and editorials on this vitamin / hormone .
This year , on July 19 , 2007 , even the New England Journal of Medicine , the bellwether of pharmaceutically - oriented conventional medicine in the U.S. , published a review on vitamin D that addresses its role in autoimmune diseases , infections , cardiovascular disease , and cancer ( N Engl J Med 2007;357:266281 ) .
Up until 1980 , doctors thought that vitamin D was only involved in calcium , phosphorus , and bone metabolism .
Then two investigators proposed that vitamin D and sunlight could reduce the risk of colon cancer .
A growing body of evidence indicates that they were right and that vitamin D can prevent a whole host of cancers  colon , breast , lung , pancreatic , ovarian , and prostate cancer among them .
Colon cancer rates are 4 to 6 times higher in North America and Europe , where solar radiation is less intense , particularly during the winter months , compared to the incidence of colon cancer near the equator .
People with low blood levels of vitamin D and those who live at higher latitudes are at increased risk for acquiring various kinds of cancer .
Many epidemiological , cohort , and case control studies prove , at least on a more likely than not basis , that vitamin D supplements and adequate exposure to sunlight play an important role in cancer prevention ( Am J Public Health 2006;96:252261 ) .
There is now strong scientific evidence that vitamin D does indeed reduce the risk of cancer .
Evidence from a well - conducted , randomized , placebo - controlled , double - blind trial proves beyond a reasonable doubt that this is the case , at least with regard to breast cancer .
A Creighton University study has shown that women over the age of 55 who took a 1,100 IU / day vitamin D supplement , with calcium , and were followed for 4 years had a highly statistically significant ( P < 0.005 ) 75 % reduction in breast cancer ( diagnosed after the first 12 months ) compared with women who took a placebo ( Am J Clin Nutr 2007 ; 85:15681591 ) .
Some of the genes vitamin D activates make proteins that halt cancer by inducing apoptosis ( programmed cell death ) , which destroys aberrant cells before they become cancerous , like adenoma cells in the colon and rectum .
Others promote cell differentiation and reining in of out - of - control growth of cancer cells ( like prostate cancer cells ) .
Vitamin D-expressed genes inhibit angiogenesis , the formation of new blood vessels that malignant tumors need to grow , as studies on lung and breast cancers show .
Other genes inhibit metastases , preventing cancer that arises in one organ from spreading its cells to other parts of the body , as studied in breast , and prostate cancers .
Vitamin D also expresses genes that curb cardiovascular disease .
One gene controls the renin- angiotensin system , which when overactive causes hypertension ( high blood pressure ) .
Others stifle the immune system - mediated inflammatory response that propagates atherosclerosis and congestive heart failure ( Curr Opin Lipidol 2007 ; 18:4146 ) .
Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) is a neurologically devastating disease that afflicts people with low vitamin D levels .
Its victims include the cellist Jacqueline Du Pré , whose first symptom was loss of sensation in her fingers , and some 500,000 Americans who currently suffer from this malady .
MS is an autoimmune disease , where the body 's immune system attacks and destroys its own cells .
With multiple sclerosis , T cells in the adaptive immune system , Th1 cells ( CD4 T helper type 1 cells ) , attack the myelin sheath ( insulation ) of the axons ( nerve fibers ) that neurons ( brain cells ) use to transmit electrical signals .
The Vitamin D hormone system regulates and tones down the potentially self - destructive actions of Th1 cells .
These cells make their own 1,25 - dihydroxyvitamin D if there is a sufficient amount of vitamin D ( 25 - hydroxyvitamin D ) circulating in the blood .
Researchers have shown that the risk of MS decreases as the level of vitamin D in the blood increases ( JAMA 2006;296:28322838 ) .
People living at higher latitudes have an increased risk of MS and other autoimmune diseases .
Studies show that people who live below latitude 35 ( e.g. , Atlanta ) until the age of 10 reduce the risk of MS by 50 % ( Toxicology 2002;181182:7178 and Eur J Clin Nutr 2004;58:10951109 ) .
In a study published earlier this year , researchers evaluated 79 pairs of identical twins where only one twin in each pair had MS , despite having the same genetic susceptibility .
They found that the MS - free twin had spent more time outdoors in the sun  during hot days , sun tanning , and at the beach .
The authors conclude that sunshine is protective against MS ( Neurology 2007;69:381388 ) .

New research suggests that influenza is also a disease triggered by vitamin D deficiency .
Influenza virus exists in the population year - round , but influenza epidemics are seasonal and occur only in the winter ( in northern latitudes ) , when vitamin D blood levels are at their nadir .
Vitamin D-expressed genes instruct macrophages , the front - line defenders in the innate immune system , to make antimicrobial peptides , which are like antibiotics ( Science 2006;311:1770 1773 ) .
These peptides attack and destroy influenza virus particles , and in human carriers keep it at bay .
( Neutrophils and natural killer cells in the innate immune system and epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract also synthesize these virucidal peptides . )
Other vitamin D- expressed genes rein in macrophages fighting an infection to keep them from overreacting and releasing too many inflammatory agents ( cytokines ) that can damage infected tissue .
In the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic , which killed 50 million people , of which 500,000 were Americans , young healthy adults ( as happened to my 22 - year - old grandmother ) would wake up in the morning feeling well , start drowning in their own inflammation as the day wore on , and be dead by midnight .
Autopsies showed complete destruction of the epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract due , as researchers now know , to a macrophage - induced overly severe inflammatory reaction to the virus .
These flu victims were attacked and killed by their own immune system , something researchers have found vitamin D can prevent ( Epidemiol Infect 2006 ; 134:11291140 ) .
Randomized clinical trials need to be done to test the vitamin D theory of influenza .
With what we know now , however , perhaps an annual shot of 600,000 IU of vitamin D ( Med J Aust 2005 ; 183:10  12 ) would be more effective in preventing influenza than a jab of flu vaccine .
Our species evolved in equatorial Africa where the sun , shining directly overhead , supplies its inhabitants with year - round ultraviolet B photons for making vitamin D. Our African ancestors absorbed much higher doses of vitamin D living exposed in that environment compared to the amount most humans obtain today .
A single mutation that occurred around 50,000 years ago is responsible for the appearance of white skin in humans .
It turns out that a difference in one rung , or base pair , in the 3 billion - rung DNA ladder that constitutes the human genome determines the color of one 's skin ( Science 2005;310:17821786 ) .
White skin , with less melanin , synthesizes vitamin D in sunlight six times faster than dark skin .
People possessing this mutation were able to migrate to higher latitudes , populate Europe , Asia , and North America , and be able to make enough vitamin D to survive .
The majority of the world 's population now lives above latitude 35 N and is unable to synthesize vitamin D from sunlight for a period of time in winter owing to the angle of the sun .
At a large solar zenith angle , ozone in the upper atmosphere will completely block UVB radiation .
In Seattle ( 47 N ) and London ( 52 N ) , from October to April UVB photons are blocked by the atmosphere so one 's skin cannot make vitamin D. ( The half - life of circulating vitamin D is approximately one month . )
Making matters worse , even when UVB radiation is available in sunlight , health authorities , led by the American Academy of Dermatology , warn people to shield themselves from the sun to avoid getting skin cancer .

Except for oily fish like ( wild - only ) salmon , mackerel , and sardines and cod liver oil  and also sun-dried mushrooms  very little vitamin D is naturally present in our food .
Milk , orange juice , butter , and breakfast cereal are fortified with vitamin D , but with only 100 IU per serving .
One would have to drink 200 8 - oz .
glasses of milk to obtain as much vitamin D as skin makes fully exposed to the noonday sun .
The U.S. Food and Nutrition Board in the Institute of Medicine puts the Recommended Dietary Allowance ( RDA ) for vitamin D at 200 IU for children and adults less than 50 years old , 400 IU for adults age 5070 , and 800 IU for adults over the age of 70 .
Most multivitamin preparations contain 400 IU of vitamin D.
These guidelines are directed towards maintaining bone health and are sufficient to prevent rickets  but not cancer , cardiovascular disease , multiple sclerosis , or influenza .
Without evidence to support it , the board arbitrarily set the safe upper limit for vitamin D consumption at 2,000 IU / day .
Vitamin D ( 25 - hydroxyvitamin D ) blood levels , the barometer for vitamin D status , are measured in nanograms per milliliter ( ng / ml ) or nanomoles per liter ( nmol / l ) , where ng / ml = 0.4 nmol / l.
Children and adults need a vitamin D blood level > 8 ng/ml to prevent rickets and osteomalacia ( demineralization and softening of bones ) respectively .
It takes a concentration > 20 ng/ ml to keep parathyroid hormone levels in a normal range .
A level > 34 ng/ml is required to ensure peak intestinal calcium absorption .
Finally , neuromuscular performance steadily improves in elderly people as vitamin D levels rise up to 50 ng / ml .
Accordingly , a vitamin D blood level < 8 ng / ml is regarded as severely deficient ; 819 , deficient ; and 20  29 , insufficient , i.e. , too low for good health .
A level >30 ng/ml is sufficient , but experts now consider 5099 ng / ml to be the optimal level of vitamin D. Levels 100150 ng / ml are excessive and > 150 ng / ml , potentially toxic .
A majority of Americans have insufficient or deficient vitamin D blood levels .
In veterans undergoing heart surgery at the Seattle VA hospital , I found that 78 % had a low vitamin D level : 12 % were insufficient ; 56 % , deficient ; and 10 % were severely deficient .
Bio-Tech Pharmacal Vit ... Buy New $ 15.69 ( as of 07:45 EST - Details )
In order to enjoy optimal health , we should maintain a vitamin D blood level of ≥ 5099 ng / ml .
Without sun exposure , to reach a level of 50 ng / ml requires taking a 5,000 IU / day vitamin D supplement .
There are two kinds of vitamin D supplements : vitamin D3 ( cholecalciferol ) , the kind our skin makes , and vitamin D2 ( ergocalciferol ) , a synthetic variant made by irradiating plants .
Vitamin D2 is only 1030 % as effective in raising 25 - hydroxyvitamin D blood levels compared to vitamin D3 , leading the authors of a recent study conclude , " Vitamin D2 should not be regarded as a nutrient suitable for supplementation or fortification " ( Am J Clin Nutr 2006;84:694697 ) .
Concerns about vitamin D toxicity are overblown , along with those about sun exposure .
As one researcher in the field puts it , " Worrying about vitamin D toxicity is like worrying about drowning when you 're dying of thirst . "
The LD50 of vitamin D in dogs ( the dose that will kill half the animals ) is 3,520,000 IU / kilogram .
One can take a 10,000 IU vitamin D supplement every day , month after month safely , with no evidence of adverse effect .
( Am J Clin Nutr 1999;69:842856 ) .
A person must consume 50,000 IU a day for several months before hypercalcemia ( an elevated calcium level in the blood , which is the initial manifestation of vitamin D toxicity ) might occur .
Vitamin D in a physiologic dose ( 5,000 IU / day ) prevents the build up of calcium in blood vessels .
( Circulation 1997;96:17551760 ) .
If one takes 10,000 IU of vitamin D a day and spends a lot of time in the sun , it would be prudent to check vitamin D blood level to ensure that it does not exceed 100 ng / ml .
Sensible sun exposure should be encouraged , not maligned .
If one avoids sunburn , the sun 's health - giving benefits far outweigh its detrimental effects .
A large body of evidence indicates that sunlight does not cause the most lethal form of skin cancer , malignant melanoma .
A U.S. Navy study found that melanoma occurred more frequently in sailors who worked indoors all the time .
Those who worked outdoors had the lowest incidence of melanoma .
Also , most melanomas appear on parts of the body that are seldom exposed to sunlight ( Arch Environ Health 1990 ; 45:261267 ) .
Sun exposure is associated with increased survival from melanoma ( J Natl Cancer Inst 2005;97:195199 ) .
Another study showed that people who had longer lifetime exposure to the sun without burning were less likely to get melanomas than those with less exposure ( J Invest Dermatol 2003;120:10871093 . )

The rise in skin cancers over the last 25 years parallels the rise in use of sunscreen lotions , which block vitamin D- producing UVB radiation but not cancer - causing ultraviolet A radiation ( UVA ) .
( Newer sunscreen lotions also block out UVA . )
Each year there are 8,000 deaths from melanoma and 1,500 deaths from nonmelanoma ( squamous and basal cell ) skin cancer .
Surgical excision of nonmelanoma skin cancers cures them , except in rare cases where the growth has been allowed to linger for a long time and metastasize .
Dr. John Cannell , Executive Director of the Vitamin D Council , makes this point : 1,500 deaths occur each year from non-melanoma skin cancer , but 1,500 deaths occur each day from other cancers that vitamin D in optimal doses might well prevent .
( The Vitamin D Council website is an excellent source of information on vitamin D. )
The U.S. government and its citizens currently spend $ 2,000 billion dollars ( $ 2 trillion ) on " health care , " i.e. , sickness care , each year .
The cost of taking a 5,000 IU supplement of vitamin D every day for a year is $ 22.00 .
The cost for 300 million Americans taking this supplement would be $ 6.6 billion dollars .
The number and variety of diseases that vitamin D at this dose could prevent , starting with a 50 percent reduction in cancer , is mind - boggling .
If everyone took 5,000 IU / day of vitamin D , the U.S. " health care " industry would shrink .
It would no longer account for 16 percent of the gross domestic product .
Health food stores typically do not sell vitamin D3 in 5,000 IU tablets , but they are readily available online .
BIO - TECH Pharmacal produces both 5,000 and 50,000 IU tablets of Vitamin D3 , which online sites sell .
Some people prefer to take one 50,000 IU tablet a week ( equivalent to 7,100 IU a day ) and a three - day course of 150,000 IU vitamin D at the first sign of a cold .
Two sites that sell both " D3 - 5 " ( 5,000 IU ) and " D3 - 50 " ( 50,000 IU ) are here and here .

Stage # 1 -- Smart
This is when you suddenly become an expert on every subject .
You know all and greatly wish to express this knowledge to anyone who will listen .
At this stage you are also always right .
And of course the person you are talking with is very wrong .
You will talk for hours trying to convince someone that you are right .
This makes for an interesting argument when both parties are " smart " .
Two people talking , in fact , arguing about a subject neither one really knows anything about , but are convinced that they are they complete authority on the subject makes for great entertainment for those get the opportunity to listen in .
Stage # 2 -- Handsome / Pretty
This is when you are convinced that you are the best looking person in the entire room and everyone is looking at you .
You begin to wink at perfect strangers and ask them to dance because of course they had been admiring you the whole evening .
You are the center of attention , and all eyes are directed at you because you are the most beautiful thing on the face of the earth .
Now keep in mind that you are still smart , so you can talk to this person who has been admiring you about any and all subjects under the sun .
Stage # 3 -- Rich
This is when you suddenly become the richest person in the world .
You can buy drinks for the entire bar and put it on your bill because you surely have an armored truck full of your money parked behind the bar .
You can also make bets in this stage .
Now of course you still know all , so you will always win all your bets .
And you have no concern for how much money you bet because you have all the money in the world .
You will also begin to buy drinks for all the people in the bar who are admiring you because you are now the smartest , prettiest , and richest person on the face of the earth .
Stage # 4 -- Bulletproof
You can now pick fights with the people you have been betting money with because you can not be hurt by anything .
At this point you would go up to the boyfriend of the woman who had been admiring your beautiful self all evening and challenge him to a battle of wits for money .
You have no worry about losing this battle of wits because you know all , have all the money to cover this bet , and you obviously win a fight that might erupt if he looses .
Stage # 5 -- Invisible
This is the final stage of drunkenness .
At this point you can do absolutely anything because no one can see you .
You can get up and dance on a table ; you can strip down to your underwear , to impress the people who have been admiring you all evening , because the rest of the people in the room cannot see you .
You are also invisible to the person whom you have picked a fight with earlier in the evening .
You can walk through the streets singing at the top of your lungs ( because of course you are still smart and know the tune perfectly ) and no one will think anything of it because they can't see you .
All your social inhibitions are gone .
You can do anything , because no one will know .
And you certainly wo n't remember !

While some attendees were disappointed that Industry Minister Jim Prentice was not more responsive to the copyright questions posed at this weekend 's open house , I found the comments very insightful since they provide a roadmap for how Prentice is likely to justify tomorrow 's introduction of a Canadian DMCA .
I expect that the launch will include some well co-ordinated laudatory comments from groups like CRIA and the CMPDA , yet the Minister is likely to focus on four points to justify his " framework legislation " :
1. Canada Needs This Legislation To Meet Its International Treaty Obligations .
This is a reference to the World Intellectual Property Organization 's Internet Treaties that Canada signed in 1997 but has not yet implemented or ratified .
While this is a bit rich coming from a government that has ratified Kyoto but not done much of anything to meet its obligations , there are two points worth making in response .
First , signing a treaty is not the same as ratifying ( just ask the U.S. which is one of only two countries in the world to have signed the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child but not ratified it ) – Canada is not offside on its international obligations on copyright because it has yet to act on the WIPO Treaties .
Second , there is great flexibility on how a country chooses to implement those treaties .
It is simply not enough to claim that Canada has no choice .
We do .
We can meet the treaty standards and still protect fair dealing , privacy , consumer , and education interests .
It is Prentice 's choice not to do so .
2. Trading Partner Criticism .
The trading partner here is , of course , the United States .
While Prentice has n't had the time to meet with education and consumer groups on copyright , U.S. Ambassador to David Wilkins jumped right to the front of the line .
As I 've pointed out before , the U.S. criticizes just about everybody on copyright – Canada is in good company .
Moreover , this is a government that promised to " Stand Up for Canada " , not take dictation from U.S. officials on the content of Canadian law ( note how the Israelis , facing significant U.S. pressure of their own , managed to do just that ) .
Even if you accept that it is important to address U.S. criticisms , that still does not justify the Canadian DMCA .
The U.S. could hardly object to a more flexible fair dealing approach with protection for time shifting , device shifting , and parody since that reflects its own copyright law .
3 . This Is Just an Extension of the Liberal 's C - 60 .
This theme arises a couple of times as Prentice claims he is only doing what the Liberals tried to do and that concerns about the lack of consultation are addressed by the 2001 copyright consultation .
With respect , this is utter nonsense .
While Bill C - 60 had its faults , it did attempt to strike a balance and preserve fair dealing rights in Canada .
Prentice 's Canadian DMCA by contrast will largely eliminate fair dealing in the digital world .
Moreover , the 2001 consultation was a lifetime ago in terms of technology and the Internet .
Given how much has changed ( more people have written and called the Minister in the last week than responded to the 2001 consultation ) – and how much we 've learned about what not to do – citing a six year old consultation as the basis for the Canadian DMCA does not pass the laugh test .
4. Business Wants This Legislation .
Prentice claims that virtually every CEO he talks with wants this legislation .
If true , he needs to get out more .
Has he talked to the Canadian telcos about their desire for more flexible fair dealing ?
Has he talked to the broadcasters who are concerned with the already increasing costs associated with copyright in Canada ?
Has he talked to music executives like Terry McBride at Nettwerk who oppose this legislation ?
Has he talked to companies like Google that point to the great flexibility in implementing the WIPO Treaties ?
Has he talked to companies like Skylink Technologies , the Ontario company that spent more than $ 3 million dollars fighting a U.S. DMCA lawsuit ?
Has he talked to the leading consumer electronics companies that are crying out for more flexible fair dealing under Canadian law ?
Has he talked to Canada 's retailers who want the government to live up to their promise to eliminate the private copying levy ?
The Canadian DMCA will have enormous impact on the lives of millions of Canadians .
We deserve far better than a series of weak justifications for this law .
You know what you know , right ?
You know something that other ’s do n’t .
Or at least your perspective on a topic is unique .
But does any of that matter of you ca n’t communicate it ?
From my post yesterday , How Not Knowing Something Makes You More Of An Expert , an interesting conversation emerged .
I really enjoyed hearing your perspectives on whether an expert had to know everything or not .
What most of us agreed upon is that the term expert can apply to anyone who has a unique and valuable perspective on a topic .
In other words , you do n’t have to be at the top of the ladder to be considered an expert .
Rather , you can be seen as an expert simply by knowing more than your audience .
The second , and I think more important , point that was made had to do with how you get the title of ‘ expert ’ in the first place .
We almost unanimously agreed that it ’s unfair to designate yourself as an expert in anything .
That designation is reserved for other people to ‘ judge you ’ by .
The conversation on this topics was ( still is – as it keeps going ) great .
But one comment stood out for me .
It was from Michael Sass , who , unfortunately , did n’t leave a URL for us to follow .
Check this out …
Interesting topic that can trigger self - worth and self esteem issues .
Here 's my takeâ€ ¦Clients work with us not because of what we know , but because of our ability to bridge the gap between what we know and what our clients know .
We are experts and students of our given fields .
We have gathered a great deal of information and experience , but remain open to learning .
A master is an expert and a student at the same time .
Standing on a mountain of information and experience , they remain open to the unknown , and are not fooled into believing they 're finished learning .
When I read this , so many ideas popped off in my mind that I was n’t sure exactly how to respond .
Yet , I managed this :
Yes !
Yes !
Yes !
Now you 're sounding a bit more like Confucius than Seth ( Godin ) .
What you describe is very close to what I think as well .
Personally , I run a business that 's about knowing , learning and synthesizing a number of components – marketing , business development , strategic planning , copy writing , website development , usability , graphic design , social media – to help people grow their businesses through the internet .
So not only do I need to know what I know , I also need to keep up with areas that are quickly and constantly changing .
And because I coach and consult with my clients , if I can't effectively communicate what I know , then what I know is virtually useless .
Notice I did n't say teach .
I said communicate .
Teachers often just spew out information ( think of your TA 's in college ) without much concern whether they 're doing so in the most effective way for people to learn .
Communication , on the other hand , is about being understood .
And the coaching is about helping people apply their new understandings .
Does all this make me an expert ?
I do n't care , really or personally .
All I care about is helping my clients â€ ˜get it and use it . '
Again , I ’m running through tons of thoughts right now .
But the one that sticks out the most is about communicating .
Are you really an expert if you ca n’t communicate – clearly share – what you know ?
I wonder .
I know plenty of people who have a lot to offer .
I know far less who can really share what they know in a way that benefits others .
So , I ask you , can we consider someone with knowledge an expert if they ’re unable to communicate their knowledge in a way that helps others ?

Notes on Punctuation by Lewis Thomas *
T here are no precise rules about punctuation ( Fowler lays out some general advice ( as best he can under the complex circumstances of English prose ( he points out , for example , that we possess only four stops ( the comma , the semicolon , the colon and the period ( the question mark and exclamation point are not , strictly speaking , stops ; they are indicators of tone ( oddly enough , the Greeks employed the semicolon for their question mark ( it produces a strange sensation to read a Greek sentence which is a straightforward question :
Why weepest thou ; ( instead of Why weepest thou ?
( and , of course , there are parentheses ( which are surely a kind of punctuation making this whole matter much more complicated by having to count up the left - handed parentheses in order to be sure of closing with the right number ( but if the parentheses were left out , with nothing to work with but the stops we would have considerably more flexibility in the deploying of layers of meaning than if we tried to separate all the clauses by physical barriers ( and in the latter case , while we might have more precision and exactitude for our meaning , we would lose the essential flavor of language , which is its wonderful ambiguity ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) .
The commas are the most useful and usable of all the stops .
It is highly important to put them in place as you go along .
If you try to come back after doing a paragraph and stick them in the various spots that tempt you you will discover that they tend to swarm like minnows in all sorts of crevices whose existence you had n't realized and before you know it the whole long sentence becomes immobilized and lashed up squirming in commas .
Better to use them sparingly , and with affection , precisely when the need for each one arises , nicely , by itself .
I have grown fond of semicolons in recent years .
The semicolon tells you that there is still some question about the preceding full sentence ; something needs to be added ; it reminds you sometimes of the Greek usage .
It is almost always a greater pleasure to come across a semicolon than a period .
The period tells you that that is that ; if you did n't get all the meaning you wanted or expected , anyway you got all the writer intended to parcel out and now you have to move along .
But with a semicolon there you get a pleasant little feeling of expectancy ; there is more to come ; to read on ; it will get clearer .
Colons are a lot less attractive for several reasons : firstly , they give you the feeling of being rather ordered around , or at least having your nose pointed in a direction you might not be inclined to take if left to yourself , and , secondly , you suspect you 're in for one of those sentences that will be labeling the points to be made : firstly , secondly and so forth , with the implication that you have n't sense enough to keep track of a sequence of notions without having them numbered .
Also , many writers use this system loosely and incompletely , starting out with number one and number two as though counting off on their fingers but then going on and on without the succession of labels you 've been led to expect , leaving you floundering about searching for the ninethly or seventeenthly that ought to be there but is n't .
Exclamation points are the most irritating of all .
Look !
they say , look at what I just said !
How amazing is my thought !
It is like being forced to watch someone else 's small child jumping up and down crazily in the center of the living room shouting to attract attention .
If a sentence really has something of importance to say , something quite remarkable , it does n't need a mark to point it out .
And if it is really , after all , a banal sentence needing more zing , the exclamation point simply emphasizes its banality !
Quotation marks should be used honestly and sparingly , when there is a genuine quotation at hand , and it is necessary to be very rigorous about the words enclosed by the marks .
If something is to be quoted , the exact words must be used .
If part of it must be left out because of space limitations , it is good manners to insert three dots to indicate the omission , but it is unethical to do this if it means connecting two thoughts which the original author did not intend to have tied together .
Above all , quotation marks should not be used for ideas that you 'd like to disown , things in the air so to speak .
Nor should they be put in place around clichés ; if you want to use a cliché you must take full responsibility for it yourself and not try to fob it off on anon. , or on society .
The most objectionable misuse of quotation marks , but one which illustrates the danger of misuse in ordinary prose , is seen in advertising , especially in advertisements for small restaurants , for example " just around the corner , " or " a good place to eat . "
No single , identifiable , citable person ever really said , for the record , " just around the corner , " much less " a good place to eat , " least likely of all for restaurants of the type that use this type of prose .
The dash is a handy device , informal and essentially playful , telling you that you 're about to take off on a different tack but still in some way connected with the present course — only you have to remember that the dash is there , and either put a second dash at the end of the notion to let the reader know that he 's back on course , or else end the sentence , as here , with a period .
The greatest danger in punctuation is for poetry .
Here it is necessary to be as economical and parsimonious with commas and periods as with the words themselves , and any marks that seem to carry their own subtle meanings , like dashes and little rows of periods , even semicolons and question marks , should be left out altogether rather than inserted to clog up the thing with ambiguity .
A single exclamation point in a poem , no matter what else the poem has to say , is enough to destroy the whole work .
The things I like best in T.S. Eliot 's poetry , especially in the Four Quartets , are the semicolons .
You cannot hear them , but they are there , laying out the connections between the images and the ideas .
Sometimes you get a glimpse of a semicolon coming , a few lines farther on , and it is like climbing a steep path through woods and seeing a wooden bench just at a bend in the road ahead , a place where you can expect to sit for a moment , catching your breath .
Commas can't do this sort of thing ; they can only tell you how the different parts of a complicated thought are to be fitted together , but you can't sit , not even to take a breath , just because of a comma ,
Hollywood has taught us that some deaths are tragic , some are deserved , and some just make you go " OH , MY GOD HOLY SHIT , YES . "
These are the ways we would go , if given the choice .
Dying in a blaze of glory may be cool and all , but these folks prove it 's always better to die in a blaze of awesome .

7 Russell Franklin ( Samuel L. Jackson ) in Deep Blue Sea
In an effort to cure Alzheimer 's , scientists in an underwater lab inject science directly into the brains of regular sharks .
In a twist that for some reason was unexpected by the scientists , the sharks become super smart .
They use their new skills to terrorize the research team , who for some reason refuse to let the sharks just escape into the open ocean .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
After several reasonably standard shark deaths , including a shark destroying a helicopter , Samuel L. Jackson takes stock of the situation , tells everyone to calm down , and provides an awe - inspiring rallying speeches in the face of disastrous adversity .
He spends so much time going face - to - face with adversity , that he neglects to guard his back , which is aimed at the only giant hole in the lab where a super shark may be expected to hang out .
Not surprisingly , he gets his ass eaten by a super shark .
Why it 's awesome
If we can't have this exact death ( and our line of work makes it unlikely ) then we want one in the same category .
By that , we mean a death where one glance at the tombstone lets the world know that you were the only person to ever , ever die that way .

6 Johnny Tapia ( Jordi Molla ) in Bad Boys II Cuban kingpin Johnny Tapia has a gun to the Fresh Prince 's head .
How will his partner Martin Lawrence save him this time ?
By pulling off a dead - center head shot with a handgun from what looks like 100 feet away at an angle far more likely to pick off his buddy , of course !
Martin , you so crazy !
Now , a bullet to the brain generally ( if not 100 percent of the time ) kills a man .
But , just to be on the Michael Bay side , Tapia falls backwards onto a landmine and his entire upper torso explodes .
Will Smith is , miraculously , unharmed and Michael Bay , even more miraculously , is allowed to keep making movies .

Why it 's awesome
If we 're ever near the end , we swear we 're letting Michael Bay direct our deaths .
This is exactly the kind of excessive death to highlight what a man you are .
You can just imagine Tapia in the afterlife bragging to some of the thousands other people killed in this comedy .
" Yea , he shot me in the head , no big deal .
Woulda walked it off , but then this fuckin ' landmine came outta nowhere and blew my upper torso off .
I would 've used my tongue to drag my disembodied head back to the fight , but then a bear ate my face and someone tossed my dick in a blender , which also exploded . "
Pornography should interest us , because it 's intensely and relentlessly about us .
It involves the roots of our culture and the deepest corners of the self .
It 's not just friction and naked bodies : pornography has eloquence .
It has meaning , it has ideas .
It even has redeeming ideas .
So why all the distress ?
Pornography grabs us and does n't let go .
Whether we 're revolted or enticed , shocked or titillated , these are flip sides of the same response : an intense , visceral engagement with what pornography has to say .
And pornography has quite a lot to say .
The last time Michigan had a competitive Republican presidential primary , in 2000 , self - described Republican voters were a minority .
Tuesday 's GOP primary had a much more normal partisan split , with a solid majority of Republicans and far fewer Democrats .
Michigan has open primaries and no registration by party , so voters choose on primary day which partisan contest to vote in .
In 2000 with no Democratic race but for an eventual blowout in caucuses three weeks later , many Democrats voted in the Republican primary -- totaling 17 percent of that electorate , more than in any other GOP primary exit poll since at least 1992 .
On Tuesday there were both Democratic and Republican primaries and though ballot maneuvering left the Democratic side in essence non-competitive , apparently it kept some Democrats from migrating to the Republican contest -- where they made up fewer than one in 10 voters .
In 2000 , Republicans made up only 48 percent of the GOP primary electorate ; Tuesday they were two - thirds of it .
A quarter of Republican primary voters Tuesday called themselves independent , down from 35 percent eight years ago .
In all , the exit poll indicated seven in 10 voters Tuesday opted to vote in the Republican primary .
Among those who did vote on the Democratic side , more than three in four called themselves Democrats .
It 's the economy ... at least in Michigan
Given four choices , half of Michigan Republican primary voters picked the economy as the most important issue facing the nation -- compared to just 26 percent in the Iowa GOP caucuses and 31 percent in the New Hampshire Republican primary .
Its auto industry ailing , Michigan has the highest unemployment rate in the nation .
Among the other choices , one in five picked Iraq , one in seven said immigration and one in 10 called terrorism the country 's most important issue .
On a different question , only three in 10 Michigan GOP voters rated the nation 's economy excellent or good , compared to half of Republican primary voters in New Hampshire .
On other issues ...
Among Michigan Republican primary voters :
• Six in 10 say abortion should be illegal in most or all cases
• A similar number approve of the war in Iraq
• A little more than half say it should be higher priority for the next president to reduce the budget deficit rather than cut taxes
That Democratic non-contest ...
Barack Obama and John Edwards withdrew from the ballot amid a dispute over seating Michigan 's Democratic delegates .
" Uncommitted " was an option on the ballot against Hillary Rodham Clinton and several lower - tier candidates .
Younger voters , college graduates , blacks and voters in bigger cities were more likely than other groups to vote uncommitted .
And if Democrats had a full ballot to choose from , nearly three - quarters of those who voted uncommitted told exit pollsters they would have voted for Obama and many of the rest said Edwards .
Of course those results are only among those who were motivated to go to the Democratic primary and vote uncommitted .
Note : Preliminary results from exit poll by Edison Media Research and Mitofsky International for The Associated Press and television networks .
Partial samples in 40 precincts around Michigan of 873 voters in the Republican primary and 588 in the Democratic contest .
Sampling error plus or minus 5 percentage points in each primary .
Friends of ours have joked before that they did n’t believe Thomas L. Friedman when he proclaimed that “ The World is Flat ” till they saw the chests of the girls waitressing at Hooters here .

Nearly 220 years after America 's Constitution was drafted in Pennsylvania , scores of rural Keystone State communities are declaring the document null and void .
More than 100 largely Republican municipalities have passed laws to abolish the constitutional rights of corporations , inventing what some critics are calling a " radical " new kind of environmental activism .
Led by the nonprofit Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund , they are attempting to jumpstart a national movement , with Celdf chapters in at least 23 states actively promoting an agenda of " disobedient lawmaking . "
" I understand that state law and federal law is supposed to pre-empt local laws , but federal law tells us we 're supposed to have clean air and clean water , " the mayor of Tamaqua , Pa. , Christian Morrison , told The New York Sun .
More than a year ago , the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Corporation stirred an uproar in Mr. Morrison 's eastern Schuylkill County borough with a proposal to use a large strip mine as a disposal site for material dredged up from the Hudson and Delaware rivers .
But in May , the mayor , 37 , cast a tie - breaking council vote to enact an ordinance that bans corporate waste dumping  making his the first community in America to do so  and abolishes all corporate rights within his borough .
" The state and federal environmental protection agencies support the big corporations , and they really do n't look after the safety of the people that I represent , " Mr. Morrison told the Sun. Representatives at Lehigh Coal and Navigation did not respond to multiple requests for comment .
The legal defense fund 's director of education , training , and development , Richard Grossman , has said that today 's federal and state laws too often condone corporate practices that pose ecological and public health hazards , such as strip mining and toxic waste dumping .
The solution , his organization suggests , is to deny corporations of all their rights , thereby denying them the ability to engage in any potentially dangerous practices .
The legal fund 's strategy is not without critics , of course .
The president of the conservative Eagle Forum of Pennsylvania , Fran Bevan , said the " whole process undermines representative government " and " harkens to radical environmentalism . ' "
With nongovernmental groups such as Celdf , " elected officials many times unknowingly give in to their agenda because it sounds like a good solution , " Ms. Bevan told the Sun .
Instead , she said , " I think that we need educated elected officials and need not depend on NGOs who are accountable to no one .
We certainly have enough agencies and laws that oversee sites where businesses and industries develop . "
Celdf was founded in 1995 to provide legal services to environmental groups .
Since that time , it has taken on the additional mission of working with rural governments to establish " home rule , " the legal notion that small communities can exercise sovereignty at the local level .
About 43 states currently provide for some level of municipal home rule .
According to its
Web site , Celdf assists those municipalities " that are ready to take this bold step in local self - governance " by helping to draft the necessary legislation .
But in doing so , some members of these communities are going so far as to say their local laws ought to supersede federal authority , defying the Supreme Court 's long - standing view that corporate entities are legal persons entitled to due process , equal protection , free speech , and other rights .
Their aim is to use one or more of the anti-corporate ordinances they have passed to establish a Supreme Court test case disputing corporate personhood .
Abolitionists in the early 19th century could " have ended up demanding a slavery protection agency  you know , the equivalent of today 's Environmental Protection Agency  to make slaves ' conditions a little less bad , " Mr. Grossman said in a 2000 speech comparing corporations to slave owners .
Instead , " they denounced the Constitution "  which permitted slavery at the time  " and openly violated federal and state laws by aiding runaway slaves . "
Just as judges and juries slowly changed their minds about the slave trade , Mr. Grossman said , today 's public eventually will come to see corporations in a different light .
Through decades of work , abolitionists " built a political movement with the clout to get their three constitutional amendments enacted , " he added , referring to the 13th through 15th amendments .
But the young mayor of Tamaqua has less lofty goals .
" I 'm trying to protect the community that voted me in , " Mr. Morrison said .
" Both my parents are riddled with cancer . "
Several members of his 7,000 - person community have been diagnosed with rare forms of the disease , and the dumping at several nearby superfund sites is to blame , Mr. Morrison said .
Schuylkill County is heavily Republican , and voters there strongly supported President Bush in the last two presidential contests , according to the Pennsylvania Department of State Bureau of Commissions , Elections , and Legislation .
Mr. Morrison , however , is a Democrat .
" It 's not too often you see a Democrat get elected to anything in Tamaqua , " he told the Sun. Still , Mr. Morrison said he is willing to stand behind his community 's new ordinance , and go to prison if necessary .
The ordinance is " set up so it can be done civilly , " he said .
" If not , criminally . "
The young mayor 's spirit of civil disobedience extends beyond his rural community in eastern Pennsylvania .
With active chapters in states from Alaska to Arizona , including New York , Celdf is spawning a nationwide movement with weekend workshops that cost between $ 300 and $ 400 and that are designed to encourage attendees to push for anti-corporate legislation in their communities .
Called the Daniel Pennock Democracy Schools , the 10 - to 20 - person classes began in 2003 at Wilson College in Chambersburg , Pa. , and are named in honor of a 17 - year - old boy who died after exposure to sewage sludge .
Shireen Parsons , who has organized several of the courses in Virginia , became involved with Celdf several years ago , when members of her mostly Republican community in Christiansburg , Va. , began organizing against a proposed highway project .
She received a telephone call from Celdf 's executive director , Thomas Linzey , who told her , " We want to litigate this for you . "
After three lawsuits and three appeals , Ms. Parsons said , the courts finally ruled in favor of the corporate highway project .
It was at that point that she and other Celdf members decided to change their strategy and challenge the legal system rather than work within it , she said .
State and federal laws are " set up so that we will always fail , " Ms. Parsons told the Sun .
" We have been working with these regulators for 40 years , and everything is worse .
So we have n't gained anything from working within the system . "
Lyn Gerry , the host of " Unwelcome Guests , " a weekly radio show based in Watkins Glen , N.Y. , has aired excerpts of Democracy Schools on her two - hour program , which is broadcast to at least 20 stations in 12 American states , Canada , and New Zealand .
According to the New York State Board of Elections , residents of Schuyler County , to which Watkins Glen belongs , voted strongly in favor of Mr. Bush in both the 2000 and 2004 elections .
Ms. Gerry said her neighbors in her village of about 2,100 people have been abuzz about the Democracy Schools after recent proposals to dig a quarry and to dispose of toxic waste on nearby farmland .
She added : " We 've got some issues here that lend themselves " to Celdf 's project , which she refers to on her show as " disobedient lawmaking . "
" What underlies the Democracy School , what makes it so powerful is that it's an organizing model , " she said .
" The community comes to a consensus and says ,  We have the right to decide how it is here .
We 're making a legal right to do it . ' "
Back in Pennsylvania , not everyone is convinced .
" Our environment is the only one we have , so we need to be conscientious about our use and non-use , " Ms. Bevan of the Eagle Forum said .
" The question that I have concerning Celdf ... is ,  Do we need them ? '
Do we have problems that are not being addressed , or are we creating problems that do not exist ? "
This is maybe the oddest aspect of the college football business .
Everyone associated with it is getting rich except the people whose labor creates the value .
At this moment there are thousands of big - time college football players , many of whom are black and poor .
They perform for the intense pleasure of millions of rabid college football fans , many of whom are rich and white .
The world ’s most enthusiastic racially integrated marketplace is waiting to happen .
But between buyer and seller sits the National Collegiate Athletic Association , to ensure that the universities it polices keep all the money for themselves — to make sure that the rich white folk do not slip so much as a free chicken sandwich under the table to the poor black kids .
The poor black kids put up with it because they find it all but impossible to pursue N.F.L. careers unless they play at least three years in college .
Less than one percent actually sign professional football contracts and , of those , an infinitesimal fraction ever make serious money .
But their hope is eternal , and their ignorance exploitable .
Put that way the arrangement sounds like simple theft ; but up close , inside the university , it apparently feels like high principle .
That principle , as stated by the N.C.A.A. , is that college sports should never be commercialized .
But it ’s too late for that .
College football already is commercialized , for everyone except the people who play it .
Were they businesses , several dozen of America ’s best - known universities would be snapped up by private equity tycoons , who would spin off just about everything but the football team .
( The fraternities they might keep . )
If the N.C.A.A. genuinely wanted to take the money out of college football it ’d make the tickets free and broadcast the games on public television and set limits on how much universities could pay head coaches .
But the N.C.A.A. confines its anti-market strictures to the players — and God help the interior lineman who is caught breaking them .
Each year some player who grew up with nothing is tempted by a booster ’s offer of a car , or some cash , and is never heard from again .

The lie at the bottom of the fantasy goes something like this : serious college football players go to college for some reason other than to play football .
These marvelous athletes who take the field on Saturdays and generate millions for their colleges are students first , and football players second .
They are like Franciscan monks set down in the gold mine .
Yes , they play football , but they have no interest in the money .
What they ’re really living for is that degree in criminology .
MSNBC : ' Surreal ' Giuliani holiday ad has to be spoof David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday December 19 , 2007
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This Rudy Giuliani's new campaign ad features the candidate attempting to soften his tough - guy image by wearing a fuzzy red sweater vest while sitting in front of a Christmas tree .
Speaking in jovial tones , he confides to the viewer , " I 'll be working to get everyone the same gift : a safer America , lower taxes , secure borders , job growth , fiscal discipline , strict constructionist judges -- and probably a fruitcake or something . "
Joe Scarborough and his co-hosts reacted to the ad with incredulity .
" Ohhh .
He did not do that , " moaned Mika Brzezinski , as Scarborough held his head in his hand .
" That was actually an SNL sketch , " Willie Geist chimed in hopefully .
" Do we have the real ad ? " " I want names and I want them now , Mr. Mayor , " demanded Scarborough .
" Who put you in that red vest ?
Who told you this was a commercial that would help you in Iowa ?
My god , who put the Klieg lights on your forehead while Mike Huckabee had the soft Barbara Walters vaseline - smeared - on - the - lens glow ? "
" You know , it 's almost like he 's spoofing , " suggested Geist again .
" Maybe that was a spoof ? "
" They need a statement and they need to put it out right now that says this is a parody , " agreed Scarborough .
They then watched the entire ad a second time , mocking it with cries of " That 's exactly what my children ask for for Christmas !
Strict constructionist judges ! "
" This is surreal , " Scarborough marveled .
" What a long , strange trip it's been , " he added , quoting the Grateful Dead in attempt to do justice to the situation .
Scarborough 's final comment was , " Mike Huckabee needs to critique that ad .
...
We 'll see how much Christmas spirit he has .
We 'll see if Jesus can get him to say something nice about Rudy Giuliani's ad . "
Huckabee has received criticism for injecting religion into politics with his own Christmas ad , stating that " what really matters is the celebration of the birth of Christ , " which some people found offensive .
However , Giuliani's ad , which is already being described in the blogs as a " turn to the absurd , " may attract even more unfavorable attention .
This video is from MSNBC's Morning Joe , broadcast on December 19 , 2007 .
Let 's quickly look at Joe Klein 's motivations for his tragically wrong piece on Dems FISA stance :
Unfortunately , Speaker Nancy Pelosi quashed the House Intelligence Committee 's bipartisan effort and supported a Democratic bill that —
Limbaugh is salivating — House Republicans believe would require the surveillance of every foreign - terrorist target 's calls to be approved by the FISA court , an institution founded to protect the rights of U.S. citizens only .
Democrats and " liberal " pundits like Joe Klein live in perpetual fear of Republican criticism .
They have been so beaten down after a generation of right - wing noise machine attacks , that their entire existence is predicated on avoiding being whipped by Rush and his right - wing colleagues .
Have you ever seen or read a Republican say , " Republicans should n't do X because Daily Kos will attack us ! "
And in case that sounds too self - aggrandizing , replace " Daily Kos " with " Alan Colmes " or " Joe Klein " or " Air America " or whatever .
Have you ever seen that happen ?
Once ?
Of course not .
Republicans do n't live in fear of what the other side will say .
They focus on what they think is right or in their self - interest .
The reaction of the opposition never enters their calculations .
If only Democrats and its Joe Kleins were n't so fearful .
They 're terrified !
For a gang that likes to talk about " looking tough " , they sure piddle in their pants on a regular basis .
Heck , Democrats can't even muster enough balls to criticize Klein himself for his column .
As outraged as they claim they are in private , in public they are meek as mice , afraid to disturb the great and powerful media .
While the GOP consistently beat the crap out of journalists with whines of bias , Democrats wag their tails helpfully on the side , desperate for a morsel .
Not a morsel , but any crumbs those reporters would deign to throw their way .
It 's the reason many Democrats were ( and some still are ) horrified at the cancellation of the Fox News debate thanks to our activism .
To them , pissing off the media -- even the right - wing partisan kind -- will , you got it , lead them to criticize them .
Yesterday we actually had a small break in the dam , when Rep. Rush Holt took to the Huffington Post to school Klein on his stupidity .
But he was but a lonely voice .
Rather than slam Klein around to teach him a lesson ( the way the Right - wing has done to Klein , with marvelous results ) , they beg for his affections like beaten puppies .
In his new memoir " No Excuses , " veteran Democratic consultant Robert Shrum says Time columnist Joe Klein doubled as a " sometime adviser , " and that the Massachusetts senator " craved his approval . "
Klein " would chastise Kerry on the phone when he did n't like a speech , counseling both Kerry and me about what the candidate should say and what our strategy should be , " down to the kind of health care plan the senator should propose , Shrum writes .
There were " several long evenings at Joe 's house where he importuned me with his ideas for the Kerry campaign . "
And then we wonder why Democrats have had such a hard time winning until we started working on our long - term spine transplant project ...
Hopefully this incident accomplishes some things , like 1 ) show the world the sorry state of modern journalism in general , and at Time Magazine in particular , 2 ) show Democrats that Joe Klein is not a friend , and brings nothing to the table except what his GOP spinners tell him to write , and 3 ) that the best way to win the media wars is n't to behave like a beaten puppy and beg reporters for scraps of good coverage .
Nope , the best way is to forcefully demand they to do their jobs fairly and accurately .
At its most basic , you are able to both build and publish a web page with Weebly for nothing at all – Free .
However , there are many limits to a free of charge web site with Weebly .
For instance , any site you build and publish may have Weebly branding on it and you 'll essentially be stuck on the free Weebly subdomain .

But Mr. Mulvey said that in most cases the federal agents did not seem to have good reason to believe gang members would be present .
They repeatedly passed up the invitation to check a list of 96 deportable gang associates active in Nassau County against a local police database that is updated daily , he said .
They also broke promises to share a list of targets , and failed to attend a preoperation briefing , he added .
“ You have to have some reason to believe the target will be there when you enter a home , ” Mr. Mulvey , said .
“ When you have 96 warrants and you only find six of them , it ’s hard to make the argument that you had a good faith basis to enter those houses . ”
Mr. Mulvey said that his department had agreed to have uniformed officers present at the raids in case they resulted in local drug or weapons charges .
They did not .
He said he withdrew all support on Thursday , before a third night of raids , vowing not to join future operations .
In contrast , Mr. Mulvey said , the department conducted a smooth and successful antigang operation with the Federal Bureau of Investigation in April .
Nassau has the lowest crime rate in the nation for a county of its size , Mr. Mulvey said , in part because the police have good cooperation from the community .
The conduct of the raids could undermine that relationship , he added .
“ I was misled , ” Mr. Mulvey said .
“ In good conscience , I ca n’t continue to cooperate unless these problems are ironed out . ”
Among the problems , he wrote in a Sept. 27 letter to Joseph A. Palmese , resident agent in charge of the immigration agency ’s Office of Investigations in Bohemia , N.Y. , was that the Nassau police could not even get a list of the 40 people arrested Monday night , leaving local officials unable to deal with a deluge of missing persons reports and inquiries from churches whose members had disappeared .
Only three of the 40 were gang members , he said .
By then , he added , complaints were coming not only from immigrant advocates , but from his own officers who had seen what they said was the undisciplined conduct of the federal agents .
“ These are my people that came to me , ” he said in an interview after the news conference held at the Nassau County Police Department in Mineola .
“ These are aggressive gang enforcement investigators .
Day in , day out , they work the streets , arresting gang members , and it ’s unusual for them to come to me like that . ”
In Suffolk County , the police commissioner , Richard Dormer , expressed complete support for the operation .
Water officials in the San Jose area announced a study of the issue in September , water managers in South Florida approved a plan in November calling for abundant use of recycled wastewater in the coming years in part to help restock drinking water supplies , and planners in Texas are giving it serious consideration .
“ These types of projects you will see springing up all over the place where there are severe water shortages , ” said Michael R. Markus , the general manager of the Orange County district , whose plant , which will process 70 million gallons a day , has already been visited by water managers from across the globe .
The finished product , which district managers say exceeds drinking water standards , will not flow directly into kitchen and bathroom taps ; state regulations forbid that .
Instead it will be injected underground , with half of it helping to form a barrier against seawater intruding on groundwater sources and the other half gradually filtering into aquifers that supply 2.3 million people , about three - quarters of the county .
The recycling project will produce much more potable water and at a higher quality than did the mid-1970s - era plant it replaces .

The Groundwater Replenishment System , as the $ 481 million plant here is known , is a labyrinth of tubing and tanks that sucks in treated sewer water the color of dark beer from a sanitation plant next door , and first runs it through microfilters to remove solids .
The water then undergoes reverse osmosis , forcing it through thin , porous membranes at high pressure , before it is further cleansed with peroxide and ultraviolet light to break down any remaining pharmaceuticals and carcinogens .
George W. Bush : ' I saw an airplane hit the Tower ... thats one terrible pilot ...' As Bush remembered it , he did n't see it later on tape , he distinctly recalls watching the FIRST PLANE crash into the World Trade Center tower " on television " .
He then attempts to brush it off as a joke .
Last week I turned on CSpan .
I planned to watch the Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing on the FISA Amendments
Act of 2007 , which contained the issue of telecom company immunity .
On my TV appeared the usual suspects - current Committee Chair Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) , former Committee Chair and current ranking member Arlen Specter ( R - PA ) , and former two time Committee Chair Orrin Hatch ( R - UT ) .
Their faces were all too familiar , and their seats were all too owned .
Between Leahy , who took office in 1974 , Hatch , who took office in 1976 , and Specter , who took office in 1980 , and who 's served on the Judiciary Committee since day one , I was staring at a cumulative 91 years on the job .
Damn that 's a lot of years !
- 33 for Leahy , 31 for Hatch , and 27 for Specter .
Observing the behaviors of Hatch and Specter - Specter to be sure - their veneers of self - importance were customarily there .
But Leahy , I must disclose , is a great favorite of mine .
I developed a deep affection toward him for the way he supported young American human rights activist Marla Ruzicka 's independent work in Afghanistan and Iraq .
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marla_Ruzicka
When Marla was killed in Iraq on April 16 , 2005 at just 29 years of age , Leahy was deeply affected .
He delivered an impassioned speech in her honor on the Senate floor - as did Senator Boxer .
Needless to say , I 'm a huge fan of the good Senator Leahy .
( Scroll down for Leahy 's and others ' tributes to Marla - double click on the videos to view them on youtube ) : http://www.uykucu.org/searchpage/marla-ruzicka/1.aspx
Being a fan of Senators Leahy , Boxer , Kennedy , Feingold and Dodd , and Representatives Kucinich , Woolsey , Waters and Barbara Lee , I understand that considering term limits for the Senate and House would limit the years of service for great public servants like these , just as it would for those of lesser distinction .
In fact , should the maximum twelve years in office that I 'm proposing be retroactive , only Barbara Lee would remain , since the others have served more than twelve years .
But they are patriots !
And what I 've come to understand about patriots from the legions of non-electeds who work tirelessly for causes every day , is that they need n't hold elected office to successfully serve their nation .
In fact , the hardest workers for America and for the planet that I know do n't hold public office at all , and frequently work for free .
It 's their love of nation , the Constitution , and humanity that drives them .
Not personal wealth , power and prestige .
Yet it would surely be nice to see some non-elected patriots , who have volunteered countless hours on behalf of their nation , who 've studied the machinations of the political system , and mastered the laws set forth by the Constitution , be elected to replace those who term out .
In exchange , those who term out would have the same opportunity to serve their nation and their planet outside of office , with the advantage of greater leverage .
Paid lobbying is NOT an option !
Odd to think I would take up the same cause that Newt Gingrich launched twelve years ago .
But with an ineffectual Legislative Branch , led by ineffectual leaders on both sides of the aisle , there seems to be no other way to clean House (s ) .
Yes , there is THE VOTE .
But due to ear - mark awards and familiarity with incumbents , constituents usually favor their prior - electeds and are reluctant to vote them out .
Some even view it as a breach of loyalty .
Others just do n't know any better .
The more astute constituents who scrutinize electeds ' voting records , and monitor their donors , are n't quite as willing to keep voting them in .
In 1995 , in keeping with his Contract With America , then Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich brought forth a House vote for a Constitutional Amendment ( H.J. Res 73 - 104th Congress ) that would restrict members of the U.S. Congress to a maximum of twelve years in office .
http://www.lib.umich.edu/govdocs/text/hjr73.txt
The Amendment lost by a 227 - 204 vote ( 189 Republicans and 38 Democrats voted for the Amendment , while 40 Republicans , 163 Democrats and 1 Independent voted against it ) .
A two - thirds majority is required to pass a Constitutional Amendment .
Here are the recorded results , by member , of the votes for H.J. Res 73 of the 104th Congress : http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1995/roll277.xml
As of now , there are at least 25 members of the Senate and House who have served 30 or more years in office - which is NOT what the Founders divined .
Term limits have always been controversial .
Opponents fear they 'd bring in less capable legislators .
Some fear they 'd increase the influence of lobbyists .
Others fear the loss of legislative seniority and beloved leaders they do n't want to see go .
But there is much to be said for the rotation of leadership in maintaining a democracy .
After all , it 's term limits that will ultimately save us from George W. Bush .
I have eternal gratitude for the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution which limits the President of the United States to a total of two terms .
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution
As for the concerns over a legislature of neophytes brought about by term limits , twelve years in office is sufficient time to maintain a cadre of seasoned lawmakers .
Substantial experience can be gained in the first two to four years in office if capable leaders are elected .
Senators will have gained legislative experience in the first third of their first six - year term , which can translate to competent leadership if re-elected to their second six - year term .
Similarly , Congressmembers will have gained legislative experience in their first and second two - year terms , which can translate to competent leadership if re-elected to their remaining four terms .
As for lame ducks in line to be termed out , one would hope they were committed enough to their jobs and to their personal legacies to work hard until the end .
Of course , there 's no way to be sure .
What Senators and Representatives wo n't be subjected to if term limits are established is the pomposity of the likes of Arlen Specter , Orrin Hatch , Ted Stevens , James Sensenbrenner and the overwhelming bevy of demagogues who populate the Legislatures now .
New electeds wo n't have to experience condescension by those who have held their seats for decades and who 've enriched themselves and their constituencies in questionable ways .
There is no lack of duplicity in the Legislative Branch today .
But there is one critical necessity if term limits are installed .
They must be no less than twelve years .
Members of the Legislative Branch MUST have the ability to serve longer than the President of the United States to ensure a strong legislature and provide a check on Executive power .
As for the increased influence of lobbyists - in states where term limits are in place for local legislators , there has been no evidence of such an increase .
I tend to believe that relationships between lobbyists and lawmakers gain strength over time , and are weakened when the duration of time of influence is shortened .
Bottom line ...
I 'm tired of hearing activists and non-activists lament the unending terms of legislators .
I 'm sick of hearing , " Oh , s / he 'll be in that office forever . "
With the favorability rating of the House and Senate at an all time low , most people believe it 's time to clean House (s ) .
But with incumbents who are hard to dethrone , elections do n't provide the solution .
Obviously Speaker Pelosi , who abandoned the Constitution when she took " impeachment off the table , " is not likely to introduce a Constitutional Amendment to term - limit herself and her colleagues .
Nonetheless , as Americans seeking an end to a pompous non-representative government , we must consider every option to regain control of our nation , and apply every pressure possible to do so .
It is possible that a twelve - year limit in office could offer an alternative to unrestrained power and permanent incumbency .
And while we 're at it , let 's further acknowledge that the lifetime appointments of Supreme Court Justices must also be curtailed .
After all , it was the Supreme Court in Bush v. Gore that inaugurated the demise of this nation .
Let the discussion begin !

Chinese surgeons will try to remove 23 needles from a woman that doctors believe may have been imbedded under her skin by grandparents trying to kill her so that a baby boy might take her place .
After Luo Cuifen of China saw blood in her urine , doctors found 23 needles in her body .
Her grandparents may have inserted the needles to try to kill her as a child because they wanted a boy , a hospital said Sept. 10 .
The needles - about an inch in length - were discovered by X - ray after Luo Cuifen , 29 , went to doctors complaining of blood in her urine .

One of Britain 's biggest electricity companies mistakenly broke into a woman 's home to change her meter even though she was not a customer .
The case puts the spotlight on little - known laws that give hundreds of organisations special powers to invade homes .
Electricity giant E.ON applied for a warrant to forcibly enter Anna Tonkin 's 18th - Century cottage in Bunwell , Norfolk .
They persuaded a magistrate to issue a court order which allowed them to pick her locks and let themselves into her home .
They mistakenly believed Ms Tonkin and her husband Mike Dongelmans were behind with their payments and used locksmiths to open their front door and install a pre-payment meter to control their electricity supply .
But Ms Tonkin , an osteopath , was not a E.ON customer .
Her electricity was supplied by British Gas .
Scroll down for more ...
E.ON should have sent contractors from Siemens Energy Services to enter the home of another customer in the same area , but used the wrong address when it applied for the court order .
Ms Tonkin did not discover what had happened until weeks later when she noticed a new meter in her understairs cupboard .
She said : " Knowing that someone has been in your house without you being aware and then finding out later is really creepy .
You are left wondering who the people were and what they looked at .
I was very surprised to find out they had the power to get into a house perfectly legally . "
The electricity company has now apologised and paid the couple around £ 500 compensation .
E.ON said : " This was a genuine error for which we apologise unreservedly .
" However , in some cases we have to take this kind of enforcement action .
It is only done as a matter of last resort . "
Siemens said that in about 35,000 cases a year it visited householders over payment issues .
" In the vast majority of these cases the matter is resolved .
However , in some the decision is made to apply to a magistrate for a right - of - access warrant . "
A Private Member 's Bill currently being discussed in the House of Lords reveals that there are 266 powers on the statute book that allow people to enter private homes .
The powers have grown up piecemeal from EU directives and regulations .
They allow the use of force and some carry draconian penalties for obstruction , including heavy fines and up to two years in jail .
The Powers of Entry Bill proposed by Tory peer Lord Selsdon seeks to restrict the powers to law - enforcement agencies and to tightly control the circumstances in which the powers can be used by other organisations .
Marion Jones admitted using steroids before the 2000 Olympics in
a recent letter to close family and friends and is expected to enter a guilty plea in connection with her steroid use in federal court on Friday , according to media reports .
The Washington Post first reported Thursday that in her letter , Jones , a triple gold medalist in Sydney who repeatedly denied doping allegations for years , said she took " the clear " for two years , beginning in 1999 , and that she got it from former coach Trevor Graham .
" I want to apologize for all of this , " the Post reported Jones saying in her letter , quoting a person who received a copy and read it to the paper .
" I am sorry for disappointing you all in so many ways . "
Jones is scheduled to appear in U.S. District Court in White Plains , N.Y. , on Friday to plead guilty .
The New York Times reported that according to two lawyers connected with the case , Jones is expected to plead guilty to one count of making false statements to federal agents about her use of performance - enhancing drugs and one count of making false statements to federal agents in connection with a separate check fraud case .
In her letter , Jones said Graham told her " the clear " was flaxseed oil .
" The clear " is a performance - enhancing drug linked to the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative ,
the lab at the center of the steroids scandal in professional
sports .
Jones had steadfastly denied she ever took any kind
of performance - enhancing drugs .
Jones said in her letter that she faced up to six months in jail
and would be sentenced in three months , according to the newspaper .
" Red flags should have been raised when [ Graham ] told me not to tell
anyone , " the Post reported , quoting the letter .
No one answered the door at Jones ' Austin , Texas , home Thursday
night , and a message left by the AP for a phone number registered
to her husband , Obadele Thompson , was not immediately returned .
The admission could cost Jones the five medals she won at the
Sydney Olympics .
Though she fell short of her goal of winning five
gold medals , she came away with three and two bronzes and was one
of the Games ' biggest stars .
But her career has been tarnished by doping allegations since then .
In December 2004 , the International Olympic Committee opened an
investigation into doping allegations against Jones .
" Progress to date has been slow due to the difficulty of gathering
findings , " IOC spokeswoman Emmanuelle Moreau said .
" The
information that Marion Jones might provide later on [ Friday ] may
prove to be key in moving this case forward . "
Under statute of limitations rules , the IOC and other sports
bodies can go back eight years to strip medals and nullify results .
In Jones ' case , that would include the Sydney Games , where she won
gold in the 100 meters , 200 meters and 1,600 - meter relay and bronze
in the long jump and 400 - meter relay .
In addition to any jail term , Jones could face a long
competition ban from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency .
The International Association of Athletics Federations said it
was waiting for official notification from USADA setting out the
details of Jones ' reported admission .
If she admits to having been on drugs during a specific period ,
the IAAF could strip Jones of all her medals and results from the
world championships and other events from that time .
She won three
gold medals , a silver and a bronze at the 1999 and 2001 worlds .
" Our rules are clear if she confesses , " IAAF spokesman Nick
Davies said .
" It 's the destruction of a heroine of the day , " Dick Pound , the chairman of the World Anti-Doping Agency , told the Times .
" It 's sad at one level , but it 's still tawdry cheating at another level . "
Victor Conte , former head of BALCO , repeatedly has accused Jones of doping .
Speaking to ESPN.com 's Mike Fish on Thursday , Conte reiterated his claim that Jones cheated her way to Olympic Games success by using the oil known as " the clear " and arthritis balm commonly called " the cream . "
" What I said in December of 2004 is that Marion Jones had used the cream and the clear -- that was a true statement , " he said .
" I 'm here today saying the same thing again -- that before during and after the Olympic Games in 2000 that Marion Jones used [ performance - enhancing drugs ] . "
Jones sued Conte in 2004 for $ 25 million after he told ABC's " 20/20 " and ESPN the Magazine that the sprinter used designer steroids , human growth hormone and other illegal performance enhancers before , during and after the 2000 Games .
Conte said he taught Jones how to inject HGH during a track meet in 2001 .
He said he also held conference calls with Jones and Graham where the three of them discussed Jones ' " doping " regimen .
In her defamation lawsuit , Jones said she never took banned performance - enhancing drugs and passed more than 160 separate drug tests , including five different drug tests at the 2000 Olympics .
Jones and Conte settled the lawsuit in 2005 for an undisclosed amount .
Jones was one of several athletes , including home run king Barry Bonds , New York Yankees slugger Jason
Giambi and Detroit Tigers outfielder Gary Sheffield , to be linked to BALCO and were among more
than two dozen athletes who testified before a federal grand jury
in 2003 .
According to grand jury transcripts obtained by the San Francisco Chronicle , Bonds said he thought two substances given to him by trainer Greg Anderson were flaxseed oil and an arthritic balm .
Authorities suspect those items were actually BALCO - linked " the clear " and " the cream . "
In her letter , Jones said she did n't realize she 'd used
performance - enhancing drugs until she stopped training with Graham
at the end of 2002 .
She said she lied when federal agents
questioned her in 2003 , panicking when they presented her with a
sample of " the clear , " which she recognized as the substance
Graham had given her .
" It 's funky , because you wanted to believe she was clean , "
said Jon Drummond , a gold medalist in the 400 relay in Sydney .
" It 's like that old saying , ' Cheaters never win . '
So no matter how
glorious or glamorous things look , you 'll get caught and pay a
price for it .
" It caught me by total surprise , " he added .
" It 's a shock .
I
thought it was a closed case .
It does n't help track and field at
all , except maybe by letting the world know , people always get to
the bottom of things .
We should n't be afraid of the truth , but it 's
sad it came to this . "
Jones ' career has been tarnished the last several years by
doping allegations against her .
In August 2006 , a urine sample
tested positive for EPO , but Jones was cleared when a backup sample
tested negative .
She also was among the athletes who testified before a BALCO
grand jury in 2003 .
Her former boyfriend , Tim Montgomery , also
testified , and was given a two - year ban for doping in late 2005 .
Michelle Collins and Justin Gatlin , who also trained with Graham ,
were banned for doping violations , too .
Graham has a Nov. 26 trial date after being indicted in the
BALCO case last November on three counts of lying to federal
agents .
Graham , who has pleaded not guilty , helped launch the
government 's steroid probe in 2003 when he mailed a vial of " the
clear " -- previously undetectable -- to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency .
A woman who answered the phone at Graham 's home in Raleigh ,
N.C. , declined to identify herself , but said Graham was not home
before refusing to answer any other questions .
There was no answer
at the door of Graham 's north Raleigh home .
USA Track & Field was not aware of Jones ' letter nor any pending
legal action , CEO Craig Masback said .
" Anything that exposes the truth about drug use in sport is
good for ensuring the integrity of sport , " Masback said .
" Any use
of performance - enhancing substances is a tragedy for the athlete ,
their teammates , friends , family and the sport . "
Darryl Seibel , spokesman for the U.S. Olympic Committee ,
declined comment on whether Jones would lose her medals until legal
proceedings are completed .
" If these reports are true , " Seibel said , " it is an admission
of responsibility from an athlete who owed her sport and the
Olympic movement much better . "
Seibel added that " our position on doping is unequivocal .
Doping is cheating , and under no circumstance will it be tolerated .
If an athlete cheats , they deserve to pay the price for their
action . "
The Post also reported that , in her letter , Jones said she lied
about a $ 25,000 check given to her by Montgomery , who pleaded
guilty in New York in April as part of a criminal scheme to cash
millions of dollars worth of stolen or forged checks .
He has yet to
be sentenced .
Wells , Jones ' longtime agent , and Olympian Steve Riddick ,
another of Jones ' former coaches , also were convicted in the scam .
Bank records indicated Jones had received a $ 25,000 check from
one of the alleged conspirators -- Nathaniel Alexander , who shared
office space with Riddick and also was convicted .
The check never
cleared , according to records , and Jones was never charged .
" Once again , I panicked , " the Post reported , quoting Jones '
letter .
" I did not want my name associated with this mess .
I
wanted to stay as far away as possible . "
In her prime , Jones was one of track 's first female
millionaires , typically earning between $ 70,000 and $ 80,000 a race ,
plus at least another $ 1 million from race bonuses and endorsement
deals .
In 2000 - 01 , she competed in 21 international events , including
the Sydney Olympics , where she won five medals -- three gold .
A lawyer familiar with the case told the New York Daily News that once Jones ' plea is official , prosecutors will turn their attention back to Bonds .
The grand jury investigating him for perjury and tax evasion was extended until January but is not believed to have met since its term was extended .
" He 's next , " the lawyer said , according to the Daily News .
Information from The Associated Press and ESPN.com 's Mike Fish was used in this report .
Itty - bitty , teeny - weeny Linux PCs Oct. 30 , 2007
Analysis --
Over at our sister site LinuxDevices , we 're always looking at small , embedded - Linux systems .
While reviewing Freespire recently on a Mini koobox , an Apple Mini - sized system , I began to wonder , Just how small do full - featured , Linux - powered PCs come ?
When I say full - featured , do n't mean Internet tablets , like the Nokia N800 , or PDAs ( personal digital assistants ) , such as Palm 's Foleo mobile companion .
No , what I wanted to see were real desktops or laptops that I could fit into a coat pocket .
Here 's what I found .
The Mini koobox comes in at 6.5 by 6.5 by 2 inches and weighs 3.0 pounds .
Mine sits right next to my older - model 1.42 GHz PowerPC
Mac mini , and while the color schemes are different , they could otherwise be identical twins .
Mini koobox
The koobox has an Intel Celeron - M 370 1.5GHz processor and 512MB of DDR2 RAM .
To store data , it has a 5,400 - rpm 40 GB hard drive and a slip - in slot for the combo CD / RW and DVD drive .
The box also includes on - board 10 /100 M - bps Ethernet , a pair of USB 2.0 ports and a single IEEE 1394 ( Firewire ) port .
For audio it includes standard RCA speaker - out and microphone - in ports .
Its video selection is a bit unusual .
Instead of a standard video port , it gives you the choice of an S - Video port , suitable for driving standard 480i television , and a DVI -D ( Digital Video Interface Digital ) port .
DVI can be used for HDTV ( high - definition TV ) , but in that market it 's being replaced by HDMI ( High - Definition Multimedia Interface ) .
The koobox includes a VGA adapter , since only some high - end monitors include DVI ports .
While I 'd tend to use the koobox as an easy - to - place Linux PC , I can see how a homebrew techie might want to use it as an Apple TV or other media - extender replacement .
The koobox comes in a variety of configurations , with prices ranging from $ 399 to $ 799 .
When you look at a koobox , you can easily figure out that you 're looking at a PC .
The decTOP is another matter .
In fact , chances are you'd be hard - pressed at first glance to figure out exactly what the decTOP is .
decTOP
The decTOP started life in 2004 when Advanced Micro Devices introduced it as the Personal Internet Communicator .
AMD tried to sell it as an Internet appliance , but it never went much of anywhere .
So AMD killed that line , but then along came Data Evolution Corp. , a mobile computing vendor , which rebranded it as the decTOP .
Under the new name , the device can run either Linux or Windows CE 5.0 .
However , DEC said it is " committed to enabling open - source development for the decTOP . "
Today , you can run decTOP as a stand - alone Linux PC or as a thin client .
It is a fan - less design with a tightly sealed , rugged , two - piece aluminum case .
Data Evolution claims the device is " virtually impermeable to dust and rugged enough to be used in environments normally found in developing regions of the world but which would be inhospitable to other computing devices . "
The two - piece enclosure can be opened and snapped together easily , facilitating assembly and maintenance .
While it's no OLPC ( One Laptop per Child ) , it just might be what you need if your job calls for you to rough it .
With dimensions of 8.5 by 5.5 by 2.5 inches , it 's bigger than the Mini koobox , but it weighs about the same .
The lack of a fan and its tiny power consumption — 8 watts — make it a good choice for carrying out into the field .
The decTOP uses a 366MHz AMD Geode GX processor and 128MB of SDRAM .
For storage it uses a 10 GB 3.5 - inch hard drive .
To talk to the outside world it includes 10 /100 M - bps Ethernet and a 56 K - bps fax / modem .
The decTOP comes with four USB 1.1 ports ( two in the front and two in the rear ) , a standard VGA port and video that can support resolutions up to 1,600 by 1,200 at pixels at 85 Hz , and AC ' 97 audio with stereo in / out jacks .
If you 're handy , you can upgrade the system on your own to a bigger hard drive and up to 512MB of RAM .
Thanks to the USB ports , you can also install your own Linux of choice .
For example , here 's a solid description of how to install Ubuntu 6.06 on the system .
For $ 99 plus shipping , the decTOP might be just the tiny PC , or even baby server , that you need .
Of course , when it comes to small Linux laptops , it 's hard to beat Asus ' forthcoming Eee PC , or 3ePC .
This sub-subnotebook measures 6 by 6.5 by 1.3 inches and hits the scales at 2 pounds .
The 3ePC has a 7 - inch , 800 - by - 480 - pixel display .
Asus 3ePC
After those details , things get a little foggy .
Linux fans have been chomping at the bit to get their hands on it , but its shipping date has slipped , and no one really knows even now what its hardware specifications are .
We think it will be based on an Intel " Dothan " Celeron M , clocked at 900MHz , have 256MB or 512MB of RAM , and 2GB or 4GB of flash storage instead of a hard drive .
Its I/O ( input / output ) includes 10/100 Ethernet , a 56 K - bps modem , 802.11b/g Wi -Fi and " hi - definition " audio I/O .
In addition , the device has built - in stereo speakers and a 300K - pixel video camera .
A four - cell , 2s2 p ( two - in - series , two - in - parallel ) 5200 mAh battery will provide a claimed 3 hours of battery life .
For its operating system , the 3ePC will be running Xandros with a KDE interface .
Xandros can run on systems with as little as 128 MB of RAM , so it would seem to be a good pick for this tiny laptop .
Its maker still has n't given us a final price .
It appears nearly certain now though that it will run around $ 250 instead of less than $ 200 .
But , as small as these PCs are , the current tiniest of the tiny would seem to be fit - PC .
Made by CompuLab , an Israeli company , the fit - PC is based on the company 's CM - iGLX computer - on - module .
The company claims it 's the smallest LX800 - based single - board computer around .
With dimensions of 4.7 by 4.6 by 1.6 inches — think paperback book -- they may be right .
Fit-PC
The fit -PC uses a 500MHz AMD Geode LX800 processor and is equipped with 256MB of DDR RAM and up to 512MB of flash memory .
It also has a 40 GB hard drive , two USB 2.0 ports , a VGA connector , audio jacks and an RJ - 11 jack .
There 's no modem behind the RJ - 11 port , but you could use it as an RS - 232 port for a terminal .
The PC also has two audio jacks .
Somehow , they manage to stuff all this in there without a fan .
The company officially sells the system with Gentoo Linux .
Friends of mine who have gotten them recently , however , report that the fit - PC is now coming with Ubuntu Linux .
At a cost of $ 285 , this is a steal for an Ubuntu system .
You might be wondering , considering how slow these processors are and their minimal amounts of RAM , if you can really run Linux on them .
The answer is yes , you sure can .
I own a koobox , and I 've used a decTOP and fit - PC .
Each is more than capable of running Linux , Firefox , Thunderbird for e-mail and OpenOffice all at the same time .
I would n't try running more than four or five applications at once on these systems , but I think most users will that find any of them works extremely well for day - in , day - out home and office use .
They really are remarkable .
Is this as small as PCs can get ?
No , they 're going to get smaller still .
Tolapai , Intel 's forthcoming Pentium M-powered SOC ( system - on - chip ) , will make even matchbox - sized PCs possible .
With a Pentium M core clocked between 600MHz and 1.2GHz , the first Tolapai chips integrate components traditionally found in PC Northbridges and Southbridges --a GPU ( graphics processing unit ) , external memory and storage controllers , and peripheral interfaces such as USB and Ethernet .
With literally everything you need for a PC on a single SOC , how small could a PC get ?
The new tiny PCs probably wo n't be a lot smaller than the fit - PC , simply because you need room for the ports , but shirt - pocket computers and full - powered laptops no bigger than the remarkable NEC Ultralites of the late ' 80s are coming .
Since I , for one , would kill to have a 21st century Ultralite with Linux , I 'm looking forward to the day when I can have as many computers on my desk as I currently have in my entire office and lab : 24 .
Sound impossible ?
It 's not only possible , it 's coming .
Today 's minitowers are going to be replaced by hardback - book - sized PCs .
By 2010 , we 're going to be looking at today 's 6 - and 7 - pound laptops with the same amazement as we now look at the KayPro II , the Osborne and the other first - generation luggable computers .
The day of the mini-Linux desktop is coming , and it 's coming soon .

Never gonna give you up
i do n't know if i've mentioned this before , but if i have ... oh well .
it occurred to me earlier today , and i figured i'd write it here .
back when i was ten years old , i had a hero .
i had a musician who epitomized cool to me , who was the end - all and be -all of pop music .
sure , there were those of you who thought at that time that bon jovi's new jersey was the coolest thing ever , or who thought that robert palmer could do no wrong .
some of you knew in your heart of hearts that michael stipe would always have hair and that rem would never release a sub - par album .
hell , there were some of you who were heartbroken that milo had gone back to school , and you wondered what would ever become of the descendents .
and the ultra-cool were pondering every blasted moment of daydream nation and proclaiming kim and thurston rock royalty .
but that 's not what i was doing .
i was idolizing one man .
who was that person , you might ask ?
the man with the hair .
the man with the video where he shuffled his jacket back and forth in the coolest way possible , and had a dancer do a back flip off a wall .
that 's right , i wanted to be rick astley .
look at that jacket .
daaaaaaaaaaamn .
there are days when i still wish i was him .
( he 's still around , in case you did n't know .
now it appears as though he wants to be duncan sheik .
no matter -- that watch probably costs more than i do . )
( fun fact : rick astley 's album whenever you need somebody went double platinum in the united states .
but .... but it went four times platinum in canada . )
I stole a pretty bride
first and foremost -- two cavities .
yep ... not nearly as bad as i thought .
one is small , one is , to use my dentist 's ( dr. jan is a he , by the way ) words , " very very large . " i need to go back in august ( ?!?!? ) to see if i need a root canal or just a filling .
i'm relieved that i now know , but i'm pissed that i have to wait a month and a freakin ' half before i get them fixed .
i was talking with dave earlier about the whole " under god " thing with the pledge of allegiance .
i told him that in high school i never stood for the pledge of allegiance , but it was not because of the god part , just the rest of it .
i was an angsty , angsty young man .
tiny mix tapes informed me that sixteen horsepower is releasing their next album on jetset records .
i do n't care about the jetset records part ( although they are a fine , fine record label , and their radio contact guy was a really nice guy - - yes vasant , i actually talked to him ) , i just wanted an excuse to mention sixteen horsepower 's creep - tastic take on old country music .
they 're , well , creeptastic .
i enjoyed low estate quite a bit .
do n't get too used to this whole two posts a day thing .
i'm on a manic kick .
I hear things
i spent a couple of hours last night repairing and cleaning the fan in my room .
you see , it was dusty , and it squeaked whenever i turned it on .
so i did that , the fan worked marvelously , and all was right in the world .
then i get home from work this evening , and my fan had somehow stopped working .
the fan is dead .
long live the fan .
loyal readers know about how i need a fan running in my room due to my tinnitus and all that .
as a result , it 's good that i get paid tomorrow , so i can buy a new industrial - strength fan .
( some disclosure : there are currently five ( i think ) fans in the apartment right now .
you 're probably now wondering why i'm going to buy another fan .
well , the other fans are n't quite as powerful , and i want one that will blow all my papers around the jasminlive .
mobi room .
let 's talk about something other than fans , huh ? )
maggie played the " maggie is " google game .
since i share a name with a common noun and one of the richest men in the world , mine are pretty cool ( if you edit out everything before " bill " ) :
bill is all about unions -- not teachers .
bill is back on the table .
bill is the actual " anti-christ " .
bill is a $ 200 billion disaster .
bill is a windfall for corporations but a pittance for workers .
bill is introduced in the senate .
[ hello , senators ! ]
bill is bad for america 's telephone customers .
i'm not sure if anyone finds this as amusing as i do .
if you do , there 's plenty more .
i read an interview on www.chaturbaterooms.comwith julian casablancas from the strokes earlier this evening .
the strokes are planning a new album , and julian said about that album , " we want to progress , but at the same time you still want that edge . " this stuck with me , and i'll tell you why .
any band that talks about having an " edge " just pisses me off -- and i'm sure you realize just how many bands have therefore pissed me off over the years .
" edge " means nothing .
it 's like saying something is " unique , " or " sincere , " or " inspired by limp bizkit . " means nothing .
still nervous about the dentist .
sarah scared me by throwing around words like " root canal . " wish me luck .
The life and times of enamel
Really quickly today , as i woke up later than intended , dave 's played the hell out of his new game in the past couple of days , and i'm working soon .
i'm really nervous about my dentist appointment tomorrow morning .
considering how - - thanks to a lack of dental insurance - - i have n't been " checked out " ( heheh ) in at least two years .
that , combined with the ever - present pain in my tooth , makes my mind run in circles about what s/he ( my dentist 's name is jan , so it could feasibly go either way ) will tell me .
will i just need a cavity filled ?
will it be root canal time in bill - ville ?
will i have to have my jaw wired shut , destined for a life of difficult talking and liquid nourishment ?
i do n't think i'm going to sleep well tonight .
what about the one with the sharp edged mouth and eyes
the one that looked into me with the irresponsible look
the one that now is saying
i must depend on something .
Taking your own life with boredom
so yesterday , while doing laundry ( do n't worry , i wo n't discuss doing laundry like i usually do ) , i had all these great things that i knew i should write in here .
and as usual , by the time i got around to posting ( e.g. right now ) , i'd forgotten pretty much everything i wanted to mention .
maybe i should start writing my posts on my handspring ... nah. that 'd be a little too difficult to rationalize .
so anyway , i'm going to try my best to reconstruct everything i wanted to write about .
in no particular order :
i finally - - finally - - reached my pain threshold in regards to my teeth , and have set up a dentist appointment for thursday .
now i get to find out what exactly is wrong with my teeth .
many public thanks to sarah , for the plethora of reading material and mix that she sent my way .
other than now being paralyzed in the face of which book to read first , i'm a happy man .
a corollary to the above - - i enjoy receiving mail that is sent from an actual person .
i'm not sure if that 's a hint , or merely a statement ... so i'll just say it 's the latter .
i have now possibly misused two terms .
i believe " corollary " is properly used , but i'm still not sure about the " e.g. " used at the beginning .
it essentially means " that is to say , " does n't it ? and " i.e. " is essentially " for example " ?
c'mon , i know that there are multiple former english majors out there .
tell me if i'm wrong .
a decent amount of time was spent today looking at blackmetal .
com -- i do n't know why , so do n't even ask .
i was just engrossed in looking at black / death metal cover art , t- shirts , etc. -- which becomes both interesting and slightly repulsive after some time .
many moments were spent looking at a certain t- shirt ( or whatever ) and trying to figure out what exactly was portrayed on said item .
the long and the short of it is that once i finally figured out what was portrayed on this item , 90 percent of the time i regretted knowing .
weird people , those metal people , with their pictures of autopsies and odd sexual behavior and all .
i had forgotten that at some point i had gotten the mp3 of the dead kennedy 's " california uber alles . " the ironic part is that i was actually looking for the disposable heroes of hiphoprisy version of the same song .
either way is fine .
someone once told me about how they had once misread an ad or something mentioning gil scott - heron , thinking that it said gil scott - heroin .
from what i've heard about his drugtastic ways ( unfounded or no , i've heard it ) , that 's amusing .
i think it 's ironically amusing that barry manilow did n't actually write " i write the songs " ( allmusic says that ex-beach boy bruce johnston wrote it ) .
i freely acknowledge that i overused forms of the words " ironic " and " amusing " in the past couple of entries .
but i'm tired of editing myself , so i'll leave it as is .
beginning to kick myself for not going to see onelinedrawing last night .
so i do n't own the new album yet ... so what ?
eh....i'm retarded .
my handspring is treating me quite well , thank you very much .
i think that movable type is having trouble keeping up with this post at this point , meaning that i've gone on too long .
and i did n't even remember half of what i wanted to talk about .
well , i'll be back in a bit , i'm sure .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
An oil painting by Mexican artist Rufino Tamayo that was plucked from a sidewalk trash heap several years ago sold for more than $ 1 million on Tuesday at Sotheby ’s auction of Latin American art .
The auction house had estimated that “ Tres Personajes ” ( “ Three Personages ” ) , which was stolen from a Houston warehouse after being bought at auction in 1977 , would sell for between $ 750,000 and $ 1 million , but the work ended up selling for $ 1,049,000 including commission .
The oil - and - sand canvas was rescued from oblivion when a New York woman , Elizabeth Gibson , spotted it in a pile of trash at a curbside on Manhattan ’s Upper West Side and decided to bring it home .
Gibson walked by the vibrant , 38 - inch by 51 - inch ( 97 by 130 cm ) work , then “ immediately knew I had to go back .
I knew I had to take it , ” she said weeks before the auction .
“ It was a huge , powerful and beautiful painting and I said to myself , ‘ It is wrong to be in the garbage , ’ ” Gibson added .
She was told that shortly after her find , a trash collecting truck had come by and hauled away the refuse .
Gibson eventually researched the work and learned of its worth and history through an Internet site .
Sotheby ’s did not identify the seller , but Gibson was to receive a $ 15,000 reward for returning “ Tres Personajes ” to its rightful owners , plus an undisclosed percentage of the auction price .
Apart from the Tamayo , the auction was a relatively staid affair , with 20 of 70 lots on offer going unsold .
In all it took in $ 15.235 million , coming in under the pre-sale estimate of $ 16.5 million to $ 21.6 million .
The top lot was Fernando Botero ’s “ Le Dejeuner sur L’Herbe , ” which fetched $ 1,329,000 , missing its low estimate , which was $ 1.4 million .
Roberto Matta ’s “ Et At It , ” which was expected to sell for $ 2.5 million to $ 3.5 million , failed to sell .
Another Tamayo , “ Bodegon con Mujer , ” also failed to sell .
By contrast Christie ’s auction on Tuesday totalled $ 21.7 million , the second best ever for auctioned Latin American art and just under the $ 22 million record Christie ’s set in May .
Today ’s laws are being made by a Congress that mistrusts and fears Americans .
What is it that impels men to make laws that go beyond the rules that nature and common sense demand men live by ?
Human beings respect and honor laws that govern individual and group behavior .
If a man steals from , or harms his neighbor , the law provides remedies that punish the thief or assailant .
The laws that Congress makes are often convoluted - tortuously labyrinthine .
Many are a mystery .
No one understands them with the exception of those who are especially trained to interpret them .
Even they must rely on vast libraries of precedent , defined terminology , endless files of statutes , ordinances and regulations , many of which are extra Constitutional .
When these laws ca n’t be enacted within Constitutional restraints the government , acting in its own interest , becomes a separate entity existing quite apart from the people .
“ If a law is unjust , a man is not only right to disobey it , he is obligated to do so .
” - Thomas Jefferson
For the first time in the nation ’s history , the decision of who would lead the nation was taken away from the people by an obviously partisan , Supreme Court .
The nation ’s highest court , in effect , made new law and used it to install its conservative member ’s choice for president .
After the court betrayed the republic , and the Constitution it swore to protect , it decided that its ruling was an isolated decision and could never be used as precedent .
The Supreme Court , having fraudulently appointed Bush , has amply demonstrated why the choice for president is left to the people .
The nation will never fully recover from the disaster that five justices released upon a naïve , in many instances ignorant , and unsuspecting public .
The Supreme Court was the citadel , the vessel in which the law was sanctified .
When it betrayed its purpose it delivered a terrible judgment upon itself .
If law is the glue that binds society successfully together , it must be applied equally .
The Supreme Court trespassed on that maxim .
Partly as a result of the Court ’s decision in " Bush vs. Gore , " the Bush Administration has proclaimed itself above the laws that ordinary Americans must abide by .
This certain step towards a totalitarian government signals a fatal weakness of American democracy .
Government easily shifts from “ We the People ” into rule by institutional authority .
This could never happen if enough Americans valued their freedom , and enough recognized that government serves at their pleasure , and must obey the law .
“ If a nation expects to be ignorant and free ... it expects what never was and never will be . ” - Thomas Jefferson
As government enacts ever more rules , it must become aloof from the people .
It must maintain a separate , distinct identity if it ’s to operate outside the endless laws it enacts .
This is the state in which the U.S. finds itself today .
Elected officials have undermined the Constitution they swore to protect .
Prosecutors run up conviction records they point to when running for higher office .
Public defenders sleep through capital murder trials .
It ’s common knowledge that a poor defendant has little chance of prevailing against the limitless resources of the state whether or not the defendant is guilty .
A recent moratorium was declared stopping all executions in the U.S. because too many innocent people were being murdered by the state .
The nations highest court , acting outside the law , installed a president who lied shamelessly to start an illegal war that is still being fought 7 years later .
When a nation has the misfortune of witnessing its highest elected officials behaving with vulgar dishonesty and contempt of law , its people and its institutions are cheapened .
The Bush Administration , more than any other in U.S. history , has acted to abridge the Constitution .
The nation ’s leaders , against their sworn duty , threaten the people ’s freedom and well - being .
The best that can be said of such government is that it ’s rendered itself useless .
The worse that has happened is that government has exchanged roles with the governed .
“ The Constitution is not an instrument of the government to restrain the people , it is an instrument for the people to restrain the government . ” - Patrick Henry
The arrogance - the unbelievable egoism - the outrageous and pretentious character of so many of today ‘s Congressmen is truly astonishing .
Jane Harman , a Blue Dog Democrat , authored a bill that nicely compliments the Bush Administration ’s tireless efforts to curtail the citizenries rights as guaranteed by the Constitution .
Senator Susan Collins , a republican representing Maine , is preparing the Senate version .
The measure seriously constricts the right of Americans to descent and , unbelievably , authorizes a commission to interpret and act upon the thoughts and pre-criminal activities of U.S. citizens .
Orwellian society , replete with its “ thought crimes ” is here .
The Supreme Court , if the measure gets by the Senate , is the last defense against this flagrantly , anti-American legislation .
Thomas Paine , a great American patriot said , “ It is the duty of every patriot to protect his country from its government . ”
“ The Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act , ” is a proposed law that Bush wishes he ’d dreamed up .
To appreciate the bill ’s assumptive arrogance - its chilling invasion into what Americans may be thinking , it is necessary to reproduce its description .
“ The process of adopting or promoting an extremist belief system for the purpose of facilitating ideologically - based violence to advance political , religious , or social change ’ ) and ‘ homegrown terrorism ’ ( defined as ‘ the use , planned use , or threatened use , of force or violence by a group or individuals born , raised , or based and operating primarily within the United States …. to intimidate or coerce the United States government , the civilian population of the United States , or any segment thereof , in furtherance of political or social objectives ” ) .
A great , American humorist knew of the Jane ’s and Susan ’s of this world , “ Suppose you were an idiot .
And suppose you were a member of Congress .
But I repeat myself . ” - Mark Twain
Unfortunately , such a windy and ambiguous bill , with its impressively contrived language , lends itself to free interpretation .
A commission will be tasked with exploring the thoughts that perspective individuals may be entertaining .
It will also investigate dissenting activities that could be construed as undermining or intimidating segments of the population , or the government itself .
This commission will be based in American universities where academia , it is hoped , will support its conclusions and lend credibility to its findings .
Government ’s obviously and typically act to consolidate their power by controlling the citizenry .
Ms. Harman ’s measure is another ominous step in that direction .
With the other numerous curtailments the Bush Administration has visited on the U.S. Constitution , an opinion columnist could be held without charge , removed to a secret location , and tortured there .
“ When the government fears the people , it is liberty .
When the people fear the government , it is tyranny . ” - Thomas Paine
It ’s astonishing that some monstrosity like the one referenced above could be seriously entertained .
But it was not only entertained - it was passed , almost unanimously , by the U.S. House .
The bill ’s sponsors borrowed a page from Bush when they shared their concerns about their frightening and diabolical “ radicalized individuals . ”
The lawmakers decided that “ radicalized individuals ” must be preemptively stopped before they can act .
Just as Bush had to stop Saddam before he could send his rubber band powered airforce to attack the U.S. Said Harman , “ The National Commission will propose to Congress initiatives to intercede before radicalized individuals turn violent . ”
Congress , so far , has n’t offered an explanation of just how it will determine when or why a “ radicalized individual ” may “ turn violent . ”
Perhaps the lawmakers imagine that terrorists have duplicated Dr. Jekyll ’s potion and soon , millions of roaming Hydes will savage the land .
They also fail to explain what is meant by , “ an extremist belief system . ”
That one covers a lot of ground .
The government could start rounding everyone up who believes in U.F.O.’s .
And how does anyone know what Santa really has in his sack when he breaks into American homes by dropping down people ’s chimneys ?
Kinda creepy ifya ask me .
“ There are more instances of the abridgment of the freedom of the people by gradual and silent encroachments of those in power than by violent and sudden usurpations . ” - James Madison
There are so many laws it ’s impossible to hire enough people to enforce them all .
In the U.S , 25 % of the American workforce provide security and discipline .
This number includes U.S. military personnel stationed in the U.S. and overseas .
No other country in the world devotes as many human resources to law enforcement .
There are an estimated 5 million cameras keeping an eye on Americans , and that number is expected to double by 2010 .
The U.S. had over 7 million of its citizens locked up in 2006 .
Over 4 million were on probation , and almost 800,000 were on parole .
These numbers come from the U.S , Bureau of Justice Statistics .
The bill introduced by Ms. Harmon is in step with the Bush Administration ’s Patriot Act , The Military Commissions Act which suspends Habeas Corpus , and the New !
Just in !
Warrantless wiretapping laws .
Torture is now in vogue and it ’s perfectly legal to use the threat , or use of torture , to coerce evidence .
Of course , these laws are necessary to protect us from foreign and domestic terrorists .
The question is , what will be left to protect when Americans wake up to discover that how completely they conform to authority is the only relevant determinate in their lives ?
“ You had to live -- did live , from habit that became instinct -- in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard , and , except in darkness , every movement scrutinized . ” -- George Orwell

Google News and Yahoo News are the two largest news aggregators ( and news search engines ) in the world .
Both Google and Yahoo earn their money mainly through advertising , and these websites have so much traffic and so many page views that any downtime they have will be very expensive since it becomes the equivalent of lost advertising revenue .
First things first , the headline of this post is of course not referring to the reliability of the news items or the searches , but of the websites themselves .
When looking at the availability of these websites from January through September of 2007 , Yahoo News has had more than twice the downtime of Google News .

Pregnant workers report growing discrimination By Stephanie Armour , USA TODAY
The number of women claiming they 've been discriminated against on the job because they 're pregnant is soaring even as the birth rate declines .
Mailyn Pickler , 23 , was fired from an auto dealership a week after she revealed her pregnancy .
By Rob Schumacher for USA TODAY Pregnancy discrimination complaints filed with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ( EEOC ) jumped 39 % from fiscal year 1992 to 2003 , according to a recent analysis of government data by the Washington - based National Partnership for Women & Families .
During that same time , the nation 's birthrate dropped 9 % .
The surge in pregnancy complaints makes it one of the fastest - growing types of employment discrimination charges filed with the EEOC — outpacing the rise in sexual harassment and sex discrimination claims .
The charges are coming from a range of women , from those in entry - level jobs as well as those in executive suites .
Well - known employers that have faced pregnancy - discrimination lawsuits include Wal - Mart , Hooters and Cincinnati Bell .
Rob Schumacher , for USA TODAY Marilyn Pickler says she was fired after telling supervisors about her pregnancy .
Employment lawyers say that , in many cases , employers are simply making honest mistakes as they try to understand a variety of federal and state laws governing issues such as pregnancy discrimination and family leave .
And they say it 's easy to overlook the very real costs of pregnancy to small employers , who may see productivity suffer significantly when women take time off after having a baby .
But pregnant women claim they 've been unfairly fired , denied promotions and in some cases urged to terminate pregnancies in order to keep their jobs .
Mailyn Pickler , 23 , of Mesa , Ariz. , says she was working for auto dealership Berge Ford when she told a manager about her pregnancy .
About a week later , she says , supervisors told her she was being fired .
They told her they were concerned that it would not be safe for her to drive , which was part of her job , while she was pregnant , according to the lawsuit .
Berge Ford did not return calls seeking comment .
" I burst into tears , " Pickler says .
" They thought I was not going to be able to do my job .
They thought I would throw up or have a cramp .
But pregnant women work every day .
It just was n't fair . "
The EEOC filed a lawsuit on Pickler 's behalf , and the case was settled out of court for $ 70,000 .
Her son , Jesse , is 3 , and Pickler , who is now a stay - at - home mom , is pregnant again .
The rise in pregnancy discrimination cases is important now because more women of child - bearing age are in the labor force :
Women make up about 47 % of the total labor force , and they 're projected to account for more than half of the increase in total labor force growth from 2002 until 2012 , according to the Department of Labor .
And more working women are having children at a later age , when careers are better established and more is financially at stake .
In 2000 , the average American woman having her first child was almost 25 years old .
In 1970 , the average age was 21.4 years for a first birth , according to a 2002 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Pregnancy discrimination cases also are costing companies more money .
In fiscal year 2003 , theEEOC and state and local agencies collected $ 12.4 million from charges of pregnancy discrimination ( that amount excludes any awards obtained through lawsuits ) , vs. $ 3.7 million collected in 1992 .
Money may also come from other sources , such as conciliation agreements with employers and benefits obtained through mediation .
The length of time it takes a case to come to trial or settle can vary .
Some cases are resolved within a year ; some may drag on in the courts for a number of years .
" We 've seen an explosion , a huge increase in cases , " says Mary Jo O'Neill , a regional lawyer with the EEOC .
" The kind of cases we 're seeing are very blatant , cases where managers say , ' We do n't want pregnant women working here . ' " Several factors may be behind the trend : • More pregnant women are staying in the workplace rather than going on early leave .
More women are working while pregnant , and they 're working further into their pregnancies .
In the decade before the 1978 passage of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act , more than half of employed women quit their jobs when they became pregnant , according to the National Partnership for Women & Families analysis of government data .
The non-profit education and advocacy group also found that , by the early 1990s , that number dropped to 27 % of pregnant women .
" The discrimination is more prevalent because there are so many more women who are working pregnant , " says Debra Ness , president of the National Partnership for Women & Families .
" People think pregnancy discrimination is a thing of the past , that it does n't happen anymore .
But it does . "
• Productivity pressures and the economy .
The sluggish economy in recent years has pushed employers to lay off workers and stress productivity , leaving fewer employees doing more work .
Employers may see pregnant workers — with pending maternity leave and their possible need for more flexible work arrangements in the future — as a liability .
" Pregnancy is expensive for employers , " says Veronica Duffy , an employment lawyer in Rapid City , S.D. , who has represented pregnant women filing discrimination claims .
" And as health insurance costs rise , costs become more of an issue .
Employers are driven to discriminate . "
• Stereotypes about pregnant women persist .
Mounting research shows that women who become pregnant are viewed as less competent in the workplace — a view that is held by both male and female co-workers .
In one study published in 1993 in the Journal of Organizational Behavior , pregnant and non-pregnant women performed tasks that were rated by college students drafted for the research .
While both subjects performed the same , those who were pregnant consistently received lower performance ratings .
They were viewed as overly emotional , often irrational , physically limited and less than committed to their jobs , according to the report .
In another study , pregnant women were interviewed about their own experiences on the job .
About half said their supervisors ' reactions to their pregnancies were negative , according to the report published in 1997 in the Journal of Business and Psychology .
They also reported intrusive comments from co-workers , including such comments as , " Why are you eating so much ? " and , " Do you have stretch marks yet ? "
About half of pregnant women managers said subordinates became upset or hostile .
" When women become pregnant , they 're seen as putting personal life ahead of work , " says Jane Halpert , an associate professor of industrial and organizational psychology at DePaul University who worked on the studies .
" There 's a whole set of separate attitudes that show up at work when you get pregnant . "
Roberta Carlton says she 's seen it firsthand .
When she was working as a manager at a software company , she says she wanted to hire a woman who had just had a baby .
She says her boss said the job applicant was a new parent and would n't be able to put in the hours .
What the boss did n't know was that Carlton was three months pregnant at the time .
" You wonder how many women deal with this , " says Carlton , 39 , who went on maternity leave and was later laid off .
She now is a vice president at a public relations firm in Lexington , Mass .
" I thought pregnancy was something people were educated about .
I had n't realized anything that blatant happened anymore . "
Employers have concerns
But employment lawyers also point out that there are some valid concerns for companies .
Small employers can be especially hard hit if they have a large number of women who go out on maternity leave : Productivity can suffer , and there can be extra work for co-workers who are forced to pick up the slack .
Employers can also wind up in a bind if they hire a woman who goes on maternity leave during a critical time , such as a tax - preparation firm that loses a woman to leave during April , when demand is at its peak .
" It can create an enormous challenge for a small organization , " says Michael Lotito , a San Francisco - based employment lawyer .
He says employers can also feel unable to take disciplinary action against a pregnant employee who is n't performing because they fear it will be seen as discriminatory .
And Lotito says part of the increase in discrimination claims could be coming simply because employers are making honest mistakes or are confused by conflicting laws .
Many states have protections for pregnant women that go beyond the federal law .
For example , they may mandate that pregnant women be allowed to get some paid time off through employee payroll taxes .
Federal law allows for 12 weeks of unpaid leave .
Generally , under current federal law , an employer should n't ask job applicants if they are pregnant ; a job seeker also is not required to inform an employer of her pregnancy , legal experts say .
An employer also can't force a pregnant woman to take time off during her pregnancy or force her to quit because of fears the work may be hazardous to her or her fetus .
Employees who go on maternity leave must generally get the same treatment as other employees with disabilities or time off .
Susan Kenna , 38 , says her employer did n't make accommodations for her when she became pregnant with triplets .
She says managers cut her pay after she needed to go on bed rest , and she says she was cut out of meetings before being put on bed rest and generally pressured to quit .
She was on bed rest for one week .
Kenna , who worked as a director at Gitto / Global Corp. , went into early labor on Sept. 28 , 2001 , and her triplets died shortly after birth .
She says in a lawsuit filed last year against her employer that stress over discrimination played a role in triggering the early births .
Gitto / Global , a manufacturer of specialty compounds , filed for bankruptcy protection in September 2004 and sold its assets to S & E Specialty Polymers .
Gitto / Global has been embroiled in scandal following accusations top officials created bogus customers and bilked lenders out of millions of dollars .
A spokeswoman declined to comment , saying the lawsuit originated before the sale .
The case was filed in August 2004 and is still pending .
A trial date has not yet been set .
" I believe the stress caused my pre-term labor , and I filed a lawsuit because I did n't want my children to die in vain , " says Kenna , of Sterling , Mass. , who is now the mother of 2 - year - old twin girls and a son who is just over 2 months old .
" A lot of people at companies are getting away with this , and they have to be called on their bad behavior . "
Members of Parliament today get a chance to cast vote on the need to set up an inquiry into the conduct of Government policy in relation to the war in Iraq .
The debate is secured in Plaid Cymru and SNP Opposition Day debate , and is supported by a cross party coalition of MPs .
The motion concerning the debate is based on Early Day Motion 1088 , " Conduct of Government Policy in relation to the war against Iraq " .
The EDM and the longer version published in the House of Commons Future Business attracted 164 signatures ( including 33 Labour , 60 Conservatives and 59 Liberal Democrats MPs ) .
Plaid Cymru's Defence spokesperson , Adam Price MP said today : " Three and a half years on and Iraq is mired in blood , and the shocking figures published recently show that the death toll has reached 655,000 .
Neither the Hutton nor Butler Inquiries addressed the question if the Parliament and country were misled into this bloody conflict .
I believe that it is essential for the credibility of our democracy that we establish what combination of deception , delusion and ineptitude carried us down this fateful path .
" This debate is not about revisiting old ground - it is an urgent attempt to restore the balance of power between Parliament and the Executive ; and of the utmost contemporary relevance if we are to prevent such tragedies from happening again .
It will probably be the first and last occasion to restore proper accountability of Government . "
SNP Leader Alex Salmond said : " This debate offers MPs a second chance - a chance to re-establish Parliamentary accountability over an executive who has led the country into a bloody quagmire - and a last chance to change strategy and direction on the disastrous course of events in Iraq .
" If this motion carries - or indeed even if it records a substantial shift in opinion since the vote which took us to war - Mr Blair 's time in Downing Street will be numbered in days , not weeks or months . "
The text of the motion is based on Early Day Motion 1088 : " That this House believes that there should be a select committee of seven honourable Members , being members of Her Majesty 's Privy Council , to review the way in which the responsibilities of government were discharged in relation to Iraq and all matters relevant thereto , in the period leading up to military action in that country in March 2003 and in its aftermath . "
Sometime Wednesday night ,
Time magazine quietly corrected its correction to a Joe Klein column but the silent edit still failed to fix the egregious story that falsely stated Democrats wanted to extended the full protection of the Constitution to all foreign terrorists .
For one , the new correction still misstates the very name of the bill passed by the House .
More importantly , the second correction fails to correct the central premise of Klein 's column , turning what might have been unintentional , but dangerous misstatements in the original into a lie supported by Time 's top editors .
Klein's November 21 column , " The Tone - Deaf Democrats , " stated that the House - passed Restore Act " would require the surveillance of every foreign - terrorist target 's calls to be approved by the FISA court , an institution founded to protect the rights of U.S. citizens only .
In the lethal shorthand of political advertising , it would give terrorists the same legal protections as Americans . "
That 's just wrong , since , under the bill , 1 ) the NSA would remain free to wiretap and eavesdrop at will outside the United States and 2 ) would be granted the extraordinary power to install wiretaps inside U.S. facilities without warrants ( they just ca n't use communications they capture about Americans ) .
If the foreigners are using U.S. communication technology such as Gmail and the spooks want to routinely keep their communications with Americans and the spooks have no way to wiretap outisde the United States , they can simply turn to a secret court to get a blanket warrant that can cover all of the targets .
The original correction , so hilariously wrong that THREAT LEVEL called for a correction to the correction , read :
In the original version of this story , Joe Klein wrote that the House Democratic version of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) would allow a court review of individual foreign surveillance targets .
Republicans believe the bill can be interpreted that way , but Democrats do n't .
The new one reads ( changes in bold ) :
In the original version of this story , Joe Klein wrote that the House Democratic version of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) would require a court approval of individual foreign surveillance targets .
The bill does not explicitly say that .
Republicans believe it can be interpreted that way , but Democrats do n't .
THREAT LEVEL has spent enough words on Klein and Time 's sloppiness , but suffice it to say that no one , Republican or Democrat , who is familiar with FISA could argue in good faith that the bill would " require the surveillance of every foreign - terrorist target 's calls to be approved by the FISA court . "
For guidance , Time need look no further than the Chicago Tribune , which ran a excerpt of the original column Tuesday .
On Wednesday , the Tribune out corrected Time with only a single take :
A Time magazine essay by Joe Klein that was excerpted on the editorial page Wednesday incorrectly stated that the House Democratic version of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act would require a court approval of individual foreign surveillance targets .
It does not .
But the spinmeisters continue .
Today , Rep. Pete Hoekstra ( R - Michigan ) , who is the top Repubican on the House Intelligence Commitee , defended Klein in a National Review op - ed , identifying himself as one of Klein 's sources and spouting the same misinformation that Klein now seems to have re-printed verbatim .
For Time to continue to allow people to believe that that 's possibly what this bill would do means after all the detailed criticism it has gotten is clear proof the original column is no longer a dangerous misunderstanding of a complex issue by a two - bit political columnist .
Instead , it 's now an institutional lie .
For more see Salon 's Glenn Greenwald take on the Hoekstra op - ed / Tribune correction , and his post on Time 's second , secret correction .
UPDATE : The Chicago Tribune 's editorial page editor Bruce Dold tells THREAT LEVEL :
" I decided we would run a correction after readers brought this to our attention .
I believe that , late yesterday , Time issued a more specific correction than its original statement . "

What is America 's favorite drug ?
You guessed it - caffeine .
We use more caffeine than all other drugs - legal or illegal - combined .
Want to know what the stuff is doing to you ?
Here 's a quick overview .
BACKGROUND
If you start the day with a strong cup of coffee or tea , you 're not alone .
Americans ingest the caffeine equivalent of 530 million cups of coffee every day .
Caffeine is the world 's most popular mood - altering drug .
It 's also one of the oldest : according to archaeologists , man has been brewing beverages from caffeine - based plants since the Stone Age .
HOW CAFFEINE PICKS YOU UP Caffeine does n't keep you awake by supplying extra energy ; rather it fools your body into thinking it is n't tired .
When your brain is tired and wants to slow down , it releases a chemical called adenosine .
Adenosine travels to special cells called receptors , where it goes to work counteracting the chemicals that stimulate your brain .
Caffeine mimics adenosine ; so it can " plug up " your receptors and prevent adenosine from getting through .
Result :
Your brain never gets the signal to slow down , and keeps building up stimulants .
JAVA JUNKIES
After a while , your brain figures out what 's going on , and increases the number of receptor cells so it has enough for both caffeine and adenosine .
When that happens , caffeine can't keep you awake anymore … unless you increase the amount you drink so it can " plug up " the new receptor cells as well .
This whole process only takes about a week .
In that time , you essentially become a caffeine addict .
Your brain is literally restructuring itself to run on caffeine ; take the caffeine away and your brain has too many receptor cells to operate properly .
If you quit ingesting caffeine " cold turkey , " your brain begins to reduce the number of receptors right away .
But the process takes about two weeks , and during that time your body sends out mild " distress signals " in the form of headaches , lethargy , fatigue , muscle pain , nausea , and sometimes even stillness and flu - like symptoms .
As a result , most doctors recommend cutting out caffeine gradually .
CAFFEINE'S EFFECTS
Good : Caffeine has been scientifically proven to temporarily increase alertness , comprehension , memory , reflexes , and even the rate of learning .
It also helps increase clarity of thought .
Bad :
Too much caffeine can cause hand tremors , loss of coordination or appetite , insomnia , and in extreme cases , trembling , nausea , heart palpitations , and diarrhea .
Widely varying the amount of caffeine you ingest can put a strain on your liver , pancreas , heart , and nervous system .
And if you 're prone to ulcers , caffeine can make your situation worse .
If you manage to consume the equivalent of 70 - 100 cups of coffee in one sitting , you 'll experience convulsions , and may even die .
CAFFEINE FACTS
The average American drinks 210 milligrams of caffeine a day .
That 's equivalent to 2 - 3 cups of coffee , depending on how strong it is .
How you make your coffee has a lot to do with how much caffeine you get .
Instant coffee contains 65 milligrams of caffeine per serving ; coffee brewed in a percolator has 80 milligrams ; and coffee made using the " drip method " has 155 milligrams .
Top four sources of caffeine in the American diet : coffee , soft drinks , tea , and chocolate , in that order .
The average American gets 75 % of their caffeine from coffee .
Other sources include over - the - counter pain killers , appetite suppressants , cold remedies , and some prescription drugs .
What happens to the caffeine that 's removed from decaf coffee ?
Most of it is sold to soda companies and put into soft drinks .
( Cola contains some caffeine naturally , but they like to add even more . )
Do you drink more caffeine than your kids do ?
If you correct for body weight , probably not .
Pound for pound , kids often get as much caffeine from chocolate and soft drinks as their parents get from coffee , tea , and other sources .

The St Bernard dog - named after the 11th century priest Bernard of Menthon - may have ironically challenged the theory of creationism , say scientists .
Biologists at The University of Manchester say that changes to the shape of the breed 's head over the years can only be explained through evolution and natural selection .
The team , led by Dr Chris Klingenberg in the Faculty of Life Sciences , examined the skulls of 47 St Bernards spanning 120 years , from modern examples to those of dogs dating back to the time when the breed standard was first defined .
" We discovered that features stipulated in the breed standard of the St Bernard became more exaggerated over time as breeders selected dogs that had the desired physical attributes , " said Dr Klingenberg .
" In effect they have applied selection to move the evolutionary process a considerable way forward , providing a unique opportunity to observe sustained evolutionary change under known selective pressures . "
The findings , published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B : Biological Sciences tomorrow ( Wednesday ) , are based on studies of St Bernard skulls donated by Swiss breeders to the Natural History Museum in Berne .
Compared to their ancestors , modern St Bernards have broader skulls , while the angle between the nose and the forehead is steeper in modern dogs and they have also developed a more pronounced ridge above the eyes .
" These changes are exactly in those features described as desirable in the breed standards .
They are clearly not due to other factors such as general growth and they provide the animal with no physical advantage , so we can be confident that they have evolved purely through the selective considerations of breeders .
" Creationism is the belief that all living organisms were created according to Genesis in six days by ' intelligent design ' and rejects the scientific theories of natural selection and evolution .
" But this research once again demonstrates how selection - whether natural or , in this case , artificially influenced by man - is the fundamental driving force behind the evolution of life on the planet . "
###
The research was funded by the Leverhulme Trust .

Wicket Impressions , moving from Spring MVC / WebFlow
March 2 , 2007
[ update 2008-05 - 27 :
A detailed presentation that summarizes this blog post along with visuals and code snippets is now available ]
For quite a while , I was trying to ignore the increasing buzz about Wicket , convincing myself that I do n’t need yet another MVC framework ( there are too many of them anyway ) , but somewhere between the Javalobby articles , the InfoQ article and the O’ReillyNet article – my resolve cracked and I took a closer look .
It looked interesting and so I decided to try and migrate a selected few JSP screens of an existing Spring MVC + Spring WebFlow application to Wicket .
This went much better than I expected and two months later ( not full time ) – I completed migrating the entire app to Wicket and it is now ready for a new release as a 100 % JSP free application .
I ’m now trying to convince my colleagues to try Wicket and they give me strange looks because I was an outspoken Spring MVC / WebFlow fan not so long ago : )
So is Wicket the one true MVC framework that a lot of us have been hunting for ?
At the moment , I tend to think so .
Of course I have not tried GWT , Tapestry , RIFE , Stripes , JSF , Seam , Echo2 and the other usual suspects .
And how is Wicket better than Spring MVC and Spring WebFlow ?
Having used both , I will attempt to elaborate below .
Lots of information is already available on Wicket and how it compares with other frameworks in general , so here I will try to focus on what I experienced when I moved from JSP + SMVC + SWF to Wicket .
The way I had to throw some of my pre-conceived notions about Java web - app development out of the window may be of interest to you .
This is not a very structured list , but I ’ve been meaning to put down these first - hand Wicket impressions for a while , so here goes :
Pure Java
If you like Java you will really like Wicket .
Over the last two months , I was surprised to learn a few Java - isms that I was not aware of – such as some subtleties when using anonymous inner classes etc .
To be really productive with Wicket I think that your Java fundamentals do need to be sound .
But that is a good thing .
Great component model
The application that I migrated is a reasonably complex one , with a few CRUD screens , forms , search results etc – and Wicket offered almost everything I needed – and more .
I was able to easily create a couple of custom components like :
a date picker ( Wicket has one but I really wanted to write my own )
a variant of a multi-select check box where if there are pre-selected values , they “ float ” to the top of the list .
It was very easy to create this by extending the Wicket multi-select checkbox .
Once you get used to components ( even a web page is a component ) as opposed to URL mappings and MVC actions , you can develop at a very fast clip .
After experiencing the elegance of this kind programming model where you can show or hide components and control all this in pure Java code as opposed to hacking in JSP or JSTL , you really wo n’t feel like going back .
I used to hold the opinion that people new to Java who need to learn how to create web - applications could probably skip most of the Swing sections in the typical introductory course material and get straight on to Servlets and JSPs .
Now I have completely reversed this thinking .
Swing - style coding is the future for web - applications , I can feel it :)
In the old app I had written a custom JSP tag for the special multi-select checkbox list and was quite pleased with the result .
I used to think that JSP tags were more than sufficient to create re-usable components and using Prototype directly was enough do fancy Ajax things etc .
Now I have revised that opinion as well .
* Real * separation of concerns
Because the application I was developing had zero JSP scriptlets and strictly used JSTL , I was under the impression that I had reached nirvana in terms of separation - of - concerns .
Of course I was wrong again .
In Wicket , all layout is controlled in good old HTML files .
And Wicket has some neat - o ways to do markup -y things in the Java code itself – like for instance how you can color alternate rows when rendering an HTML table .
If you have a separate team doing the presentation look and feel work , they can truly work in isolation and their output can be used as - is .
Although I do n’t care about this at the moment ( in my case , the UI designer and Java developer is the same guy ) , I ’m sure that this is a big deal for most development shops .
I am aware that Tapestry promises the same thing .
So this is a key difference from Swing where you have the concept of layout managers .
As far as I know this is where frameworks like GWT and Echo2 are different from Wicket because they also have layout controlled in Java code .
IMHO the Wicket approach is the right one because you get the separation of concerns advantage .
And I personally like complete control of the markup .
I mean , with all those silly cross - browser incompatibilities and the need to finely adjust spacing , padding , coloring and the like , this seems to be a good thing .
No JSPs
This is very nice because :
You can do things much more easily and efficiently in pure Java than in JSP and the limited syntax of JSTL .
Ever had that nagging feeling that your JSPs were getting un-maintainable ?
Try Wicket !
You can refactor confidently and catch problems at compile time which are not possible with JSP .
For example if in JSTL you were referring to a non-existent Javabean property , you may not know until the page renders .
Pages are no longer slow the first time you access them because there is no more JSP compilation step
in my case , the app embeds Jetty and now I do n’t need the JSP jar dependencies any more .
This cuts the Jetty footprint from about 7 MB ( including Ant and the Eclipse Java compiler ) to about 1.3 MB .
I had tried JSP pre-compilation earlier but gave up because of differences in how Tomcat / Jasper does things vs the Glassfish JSP engine .
Jetty + the web - app requires only a JRE to run if there are no JSPs .
A nice side - effect of using wicket is that your pages are guaranteed to be XHTML compliant
The downside is of course that you have to recompile a little more often than if you were using JSPs .
Wicket does allow you to change the markup on the fly and refresh in debug mode .
Also ,
Wicket provides out of the box , a very detailed error page with some nice syntax coloring telling you exactly where the problem lies in your markup or otherwise – which is very , very cool .
Re-usability
Ah , again , * really * .
Re-usability in the JSP world is a custom tag or a hack -y include file .
I already mentioned how easy it is to extend ( yes , extend as in the Java keyword ) a Wicket component to customize how it behaves .
And once you get the hang of the Wicket way of doing things and how to use anonymous inner classes to your advantage , life is good :)
So compared to doing things in JSP , it is far less work in Wicket to create a component that is truly re-usable , say across all the pages of your application .
And unlike JSP tags , you get the full benefit of the Java OO features .
Did I mention that the design of the whole Component class hierarchy in Wicket feels very nicely done ?
Wicket also has a Panel concept where you can group custom markup + components and re-use the group as a single unit to your hearts content .
IMHO you really do n’t need any “ tiles ” kind of framework anymore , just create panels and instantiate them at will .
Templates for web pages
Something I really missed in the JSP world was the ability to have all pages have a consistent header and footer and I really hated having to add includes to all JSPs to achieve this .
Not any more .
Wicket has a brilliant markup inheritance concept that simply works .
Ajax
I ’m guessing that this is the killer feature of Wicket .
Control freak that I am , I was at first concerned that Wicket comes along with its own basic Ajax implementation , or in other words it provides a replacement for say Prototype or Dojo out of the box .
I initially tried to use Prototype from Wicket and was pleasantly surprised when that proved really easy .
Adding on Scriptaculous effects was no problem either .
But after trying the Ajax support in Wicket I was really impressed and soon decided to do away with all those *.js files lying around in my web - app .
The very useful Ajax debug popup that automagically appears on your web pages in debug mode is one good reason to rely upon Wicket ’s built in Ajax .
Now I feel confident that I can implement any kind of fancy Ajax on my screens , so bring it on !
One example that I tried and can mention here : it was very , very easy to create a page that runs a long running process in a separate thread and updates a progress indicator through Ajax every few seconds or so .
So using Ajax is as simple as telling Wicket that instead of showing or hiding a component using a full - page refresh , do that using Ajax partial - updates to a page .
And it just works on any kind of component .
And when you use Wicket ’s Ajax features you typically never need to write a single line of Javascript .
I came across this quote that Ajax in Wicket is possibly better and much easier when compared to how you do it in Ruby on Rails , and I would n’t be surprised if this is true .
Form Binding and Validation
Spring MVC is extremely good at binding HTML forms to POJOs , ( a far cry from Struts 1.X ) - so can Wicket be any better ?
I really think so .
Just like Spring MVC , as long as you have POJOs and you bind in terms of OGNL , you are fine .
I was able to bind almost all of the POJOs that I was using in the earlier Spring MVC app to Wicket forms without any problem .
Some things felt really cleaner – like how to have multiple submit buttons on a form .
When it comes to Form validation and displaying validation errors , there are so many options and great possibilities .
By default , you can display errors in a section ( feedback panel ) at the top of the form .
I was also able to create a Wicket “ behavior ” that would highlight the offending widget on the screen by applying a red CSS border around it .
Lurking on the Wicket mailing list , I can see folks trying all kinds of cool things such as Ajax - ified feedback messages etc .
The Wicket mailing list is a friendly source of help btw , and I got quick responses to all my newbie questions .
Other Neat Stuff
Wicket has some goodies and some of the ones that I ran into ( there must be many more ) were these :
File upload : After using Spring MVC where you have to choose say commons - fileupload and manually include the JAR , I was pleasantly surprised to see that Wicket supports multipart forms / file uploading out of the box .
File download : Wicket has a special “ Link ” class specifically for the purpose of downloading files .
Wicket takes care of all the low - level details such as setting the right content - type for the browser – so you end up doing the Right Thing .
You do n’t need to deal directly with the HttpServletRequest or Response objects at all .
Buffered Image : I use JFreeChart and in the old app I had to hack around a bit to get a server - side created chart streamed into an IMG tag .
Wicket has an Image component that works with a buffered image .
Perfect !
URL Mounting :
You can get those bookmarkable “ friendly URLs ” you want with this feature .
I liked the support for “ REST - ful ” URLs out of the box : e.g : /foo/bar / param1 / param2 – and how easy it was to use .
Security ( Acegi ) and Wicket
The old application was using the Acegi security framework .
I started out retaining Acegi for authentication and co-existing with Wicket , which was easy .
I soon realized that Wicket has a very simple authorization strategy and I was able to plug in custom code to check if a user is not logged in , redirect to a login a page etc .
I was also able to easily handle an auto - login using a “ remember - me ” cookie .
An interesting thing from the security point of view is that the URLs that Wicket generates are inherently secure .
In other words it is near - impossible to predict them as they are tightly tied to a user ’s session .
I came to the conclusion that simply programmatically hiding / unhiding links to secure pages based on the currently logged in user ’s role would be sufficient for role - based access - control kind of security .
Acegi is very useful in a URL to MVC - action mapping situation because you can restrict URL patterns to roles – e.g. you can enforce URL wildcard rules like “ / admin / ** ” can be viewed only by ROLE_ADMIN .
I will probably continue to use Acegi for a planned remote REST / POX API to the app and for the LDAP and CAS support that it comes with etc .
But I ’m almost convinced that Acegi is overkill for a basic Wicket app .
I am still going back and forth on this – so do let me know what you think .
Integration with Spring
This was easy .
I was able to manage without the recommended wicket - spring integration JARs and went with a relatively simpler ( and arguably less - elegant ) approach – plucking the Spring context out of the ServletContext .
In case you were wondering – I have so far used only the core wicket JAR and have not even used wicket - extensions .
But I ’m sure I ’ll start using wicket - extensions soon , I ca n’t wait to try modal popup windows , the file - upload progress - indicator and the other cool stuff :)
Another example of how well thought out Wicket ’s design comes across is that it took only a few lines of code to delegate to the Spring MessageSource instead of using Wicket ’s default i18n .
So I was able to use my existing resource bundles unchanged .
Integration with Hibernate
I use Spring on top of Hibernate and staying clear of the dreaded LazyInitializationException was as simple as adding the excellent Spring OpenSessionInViewFilter .
Regarding GWT , from what I can make out , getting it to work with Hibernate may not be as easy because of the way it works .
I would appreciate some comments confirming this , because this could be another key point to consider when you choose an MVC framework .
No Annotations Required
Yep , I ’m one of those stubborn types who firmly believes that the only annotation that you should use is @ Override .
And as mentioned above I did not use the annotations based Spring integration .
I bring this point up because from what I have heard – some of the other competing MVC frameworks rely a lot on annotations such as Tapestry , Stripes , RIFE , Seam etc .
So if this really matters to you or if your environment is pre-JDK5.0 , it could be another differentiating factor .
Wicket already is famous for not needing any XML configuration at all .
If the Wicket guys are reading this – I really appreciate that you have not forced users to use annotations and I sure hope Wicket stays that way !
WebFlow or Wicket
In the old app , I was using Spring WebFlow and was quite happy with it .
So when I started out with Wicket , I was trying to figure out how I could integrate it with WebFlow .
But as I understood Wicket more and more and things started to click in my mind , I realized that there is no way you can have them both – you have to choose one or the other .
I found WebFlow great because it allowed me to re-use subflows .
So as an example if I had a use - case like “ assign task to user ” and the user did not exist , I could easily call the “ create user ” flow and then resume the original calling flow at the point where I branched out , you know – all that continuations stuff .
But now my conclusion is that you can easily do all that – and more – with Wicket .
In Spring WebFlow , each view state in a flow is typically a JSP page .
Which brings me to now think that it was not really designed to reuse anything more fine - grained than a JSP view – when interacting with a user .
I already mentioned that Wicket allows you to reuse sections of HTML and group bunches of components into panels .
So when you start trying to build more dynamic pages – I think Wicket wins .
Navigating back and forth in Wicket really is child ’s play , you just call or instantiate another page at will .
You can even do tricks like holding a reference to a previous page , ( a page is nothing but a good old Java component ) so you can build any kind of complex kind of back - and - forth or wizard kind of navigation easily .
I am aware that Wicket has a breadcrumb component and a wizard component but I have not tried them yet .
When it comes to Ajax , I really think Wicket is better than Spring WebFlow .
Spring WebFlow is unquestionably a well designed framework , continuations and all , but sometimes I felt that certain things were constraining – for example you have to jump through a few hoops to access flow - scoped variables from outside a web - flow .
When you use Ajax , you do need to do that kind of stuff a lot .
In addition , in the Ajax world – you are invariably dealing with a section of a page – rather than the page in its entirety – and that is where IMHO the “ page centric ” nature of Spring WebFlow is a limitation .
A couple of other points , I did not use browser back - button support at all yet , but just from looking at the documentation , Wicket ’s back - button support appears to be just as good , if not better .
And nit -picking here – I do n’t particularly like the huge UUID kind of URLs that SWF generates by default eg : / like?_flowExecutionKey=_c815540C2-03F1-39F8-19E9-D56FC0E377B7_k14D5E331-7B59-EA45-CF06-672C33FA2097
But Wicket is quite the opposite , with a “ URL compressor ” turned on by default .
End Note
Are there any points I have missed ?
Please feel free to comment and help me straighten out my thoughts on comparing some of these MVC frameworks .
The migration was done on an open source app , so if you want me to pull out some “ before and after ” code samples , do let me know !
Afterthoughts [ update 2007-03-03 ]
Triggered by the comments and also a few additional things that popped into my mind :
Unit Testability : I have not used this yet , but if this means a lot to you – Wicket has that covered .
And before you look down on my lack of best practice :p let me hastily add that I use Watij , but not as much as I should have .
Custom Session :
You can create a typesafe custom Session class and you never need to deal with the HttpSession at all .
Refactoring :
It is worth repeating that because of no JSPs , no templating ( like for e.g. Velocity ) and no XML – refactoring of the Java code is simple within your plain old IDE and no special tooling is required .
I can vouch for that , I am using NetBeans and have no extra modules ( plugins ) installed .
Debugging , setting break - points and stepping - through plain old Java code is far more easier than trying to do the same thing with e.g. JSPs .
Simplified Stack :
In my case I replaced [ HTML + JS + Prototype + JSP /EL + JSTL + Spring MVC + Spring WebFlow ] with [ HTML + Wicket ] .
Also note that whether Acegi needs to be there or not is debatable .
Clean separation from Service Layer :
This is somewhat specific to Seam and let me elaborate a little .
I attended one of Gavin King ’s Seam sessions recently and was a little taken aback ( so were quite a few others ) by the suggestion that the notion of a re-usable middle tier ( service layer ) is grossly over - rated , i.e. a ) you normally never find yourself swapping out a layer , and b ) a change in one layer always impacts the other , no matter how loosely coupled they are .
Conclusion : so why bother , and you are better off merging all the layers into one .
You know the feeling – like wtf , is this back to the monolithic JSP - directly - accessing - DB days !?
Anyway – now I can stand up and testify that I was able to cleanly take out Spring MVC and replace with Wicket with only minimal changes to the service interface ( mostly feature adds and minor refactoring ) .
This is worth thinking over , and I also feel that a well defined Service Layer is easier to expose as an XML remote API , which I plan to do soon .
Just my 2 c , do comment !
Drugs treating attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in kids have no long - term benefits – and actually stunt their growth , a study shows .
A SUNY Buffalo study that tracked 600 kids since the early 1990s concluded that drugs like Ritalin and Concerta worked for a while , but not after three years .
Report co-author Dr. William Pelham said he believes earlier findings on the drugs ’ effectiveness were overstated .
“ I think that we exaggerated the beneficial impact of medication in the first study , ” he told the BBC yesterday .
“ We had thought that children medicated longer would have better outcomes .
That did n’t happen to be the case . ”
Instead , he said , the kids “ had a substantial decrease in their rate of growth so they were n’t growing as much as other kids , both in terms of their height and in terms of their weight .
“ In the short run , [ medication ] will help the child behave better , in the long run it wo n’t .
And that information should be made very clear to parents , ” he said .

Elephants often enter villages in Jharkhand Pics : Mahadeo Sen
The elephant , named after al - Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden , and his herd have trampled seven people to death in the past three months in Jharkhand .
Forest officials say elephants stay away from areas frequented by tigers .
Humans and elephants have come into greater conflict in recent years as man encroaches on jungle territories .
Jhrakhand forest officials said they would collect the tiger excreta from the state 's zoos and distribute it to the villagers in areas where Laden 's herd is active .
Declining
" Elephants usually do n't venture into the areas where tigers live .
And the elephants can smell from far away places , " district forest officer Paritosh Upadhayay told the BBC .
Tribal villagers in areas where the rogue elephants are active have already begun going into the jungle to collect tiger excreta .
Forest officials have also asked them not to store mahua , a local brew , inside their huts as Laden and his herd have attacked homes storing the alcohol in the past .
The elephant population in Jharkhand is declining
Forest officials have also asked them not to venture into forests after dusk , and sought the installation of solar powered lights in the affected villages .
" These instructions have worked a bit as the numbers of deaths have been reduced , " said Mr Upadhayay .
The governments of Jharkhand and neighbouring West Bengal state have been working jointly to trap Laden and his herd , but the killer elephant is proving to be elusive .
Officials said about 400 people had died of elephant attacks and more than 700 had been injured in the last six years in Jharkhand .
About 10 elephants have been killed by poachers in the area during the same period , officials say .
According to a census conducted in May , the number of elephants in Jharkhand has declined from 772 to 622 animals .
A killer elephant , also named after the al - Qaeda leader , was shot dead in north - eastern Assam state in May last year .
( Fortune Magazine ) --
It 's May 31 , 2007 , in Auburn Hills , Mich. , and the Cleveland Cavaliers , a Cinderella team no one expected to get this far , are down 107 to 104 in the crucial game five of the Eastern Conference finals against the Detroit Pistons when LeBron James launches a fadeaway three - pointer to tie with 1:14 to go in the second overtime .
One minute and 12 seconds later he seals the game with a vicious drive down the lane to put his team up 109 to 107 .
Those were the two finishing flourishes of a feat that NBC anchor Marv Albert crowed would " go down as one of the all - time performances in NBA history . "
James 's play was stunning and described by another announcer as " Jordanesque " :
He scored 29 of his team 's final 30 points , including the last 25 .
Watching the 22 - year - old 's performance closer than the bookies in Vegas were the executives at Nike , who had shelled out $ 90 million to James as soon as he'd graduated from high school in hopes of latching onto the NBA 's next great superstar , the one who would carry the mantle of Michael Jordan .
" We measure everyone against Michael Jordan at Nike , " says Lynn Merritt , the company 's senior director of basketball development and the executive who crafted James 's sneaker deal - the size of which irked some within Nike ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) .
That is , until James 's performance against the Pistons .
" Game five set me free from any criticism at Nike , " Merritt says .
Within the halls of Nike 's basketball division at its headquarters in Beaverton , Ore. , executives began referring to a whole new era for James and Nike .
" AGF " is what they called it : " after game five . "
Also watching game five intently , as if it were an IPO for a company they had nurtured from the startup phase , were investment bankers at Allen & Co. and executives at Microsoft .
And here lies the difference between James and nearly every other professional athlete .
Together with Maverick Carter , a childhood chum and the de facto CEO of LeBron Inc. , James is trying to create a new financial model for the 21st - century athlete .
Instead of just lining up endorsements and cashing checks , James is seeking equity in the companies he works with ; and he is using his on - court prowess to build a corporation that deals with entities as disparate as Bubblicious and Warren Buffett .
" What I do on the court will drive revenue , " says James .
He 's also picky about his partners , always asking himself , " Is it authentic ?
I know I can go out and sign a lot of endorsements and get checks .
Money is not the issue . "
Little is left to chance :
While Jordan serendipitously possessed both the on-court talent and the star power to become a pop culture phenomenon , James currently lacks Jordan 's ability to hold his own in a scene with Bugs Bunny ( as Jordan did in the movie Space Jam ) .
Nor does he have the political power or poetic ability of Cassius Clay .
He is also playing in the Cleve , no Chicago , and far from the bright lights of big -city media .
So Carter and his colleagues are in the brand - building business too .
Beyond these challenges , the risk for LeBron Inc. compared with a traditional company is that it is built on one asset - an asset that could suffer a career - ending injury and one that has yet to make the Air Jordan - type leap from hoops star to global celebrity .
Changing the Model
Most superstar athletes conduct their off - the - court business like this :
They hire an agent who secures endorsement deals .
The athlete shows up at the appointed time and collects checks and usually agrees to a number of " service days , " occasions when he will be present for various PR and marketing events .
James began his pro career this way , but in May 2005 - toward the end of his second year in the NBA - he decided to make a change .
He fired his agent , Aaron Goodwin , and established his own firm to handle all aspects of his business ventures .
He put Carter , 25 - another Akron native , who had worked for Nike - in charge .
" It was my idea .
I wanted to own my own business , " he says in the first of two exclusive interviews with Fortune .
He also wanted to give his friends a chance to create a professional legacy beyond being flunkies and hangers - on : " How do my guys want to be remembered when LeBron James is finished playing basketball ? "
As Carter recalls it , he was home in Ohio in May 2005 and visiting LeBron at his house .
" He said , ' Mav , you know , my agent and I are just not seeing eye to eye right now .
It 's not what I want to do .
I 'm older now , I 'm 20 years old , I 'll be 21 in December , and I want to kind of do things differently than anyone has ever done them before .
Of course , I grew up watching Michael and the way he did it , and he set the roadmap .
I want to run my own business .
I want to be my own business . ' "
So in 2006 , James founded LRMR Marketing , so named for the initials of the four buddies : Lebron , Randy Mims , Maverick Carter , and Richard Paul .
The only real core competency James 's brain trust possessed was loyalty .
( In fact , it was James 's former agent , Goodwin , who brokered some of James 's bigger paydays to date - like his first Cavalier contract , a three - year , $ 14.5 million deal .
He also negotiated the Nike and Coke ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) endorsement contracts . )
Recent American military data indicates that for the fourth week in a row , the nationwide weekly number of attacks is at its lowest level since January 2006 .
The number of civilians killed , as measured by the American and Iraqi governments , continued to decline in November .
The number of weekly casualties , wounded as well as killed , suffered by Iraqi civilians , Iraqi forces and American forces , increased last week by 56 percent but was still below the level for most of 2006 and 2007 .
The military also lowered its tally of how many Iraqis had joined neighborhood watch groups .
The new figure for Concerned Local Citizens , as the military calls the volunteers , is 60,321 .
The previous estimate of 77,000 erroneously combined the number of volunteers who are currently serving with those who had expressed a willingness to join .
Col. Martin Stanton , who oversaw the count , said he told General Petraeus about the new figures this week .
Military officials said that they were seeking to make greater use of some Iraqi government data to provide a more comprehensive portrayal of the situation in Iraq .
Though there are concerns about the reliability of some Iraqi reports , American military data generally understates Iraqi civilian deaths , since American units only report what they observe , officials said .
At General Petraeus ’s recommendation , the Pentagon is expected for the first time to include the Iraqi government data on civilian deaths in its report next month on security trends in Iraq .

While there is no question that large numbers of Iraqis have left their homes , American officials said that the exact number is not available .
The International Organization for Migration has reported that the number of internally “ displaced ” Iraqis — those who have fled their homes but still live in Iraq — has grown to more than one million since the February 2006 bombing of a Shiite shrine in Samarra .
Among those displaced Iraqis , more than 350,000 live in Baghdad Province , according to estimates by humanitarian organizations .
Estimates by the Iraqi Red Crescent of the number of displaced Iraqis run much higher , but are marred by the double and triple counting of Iraqis who move from one area to another , American officials say .
One difficulty in fixing an accurate count is that many displaced Iraqis do not register their migrant status with Iraqi authorities , American officials said .
We are governed by an internal 24 - hour clock
Although the process involves complex genes , the whole mechanism is controlled by a single amino acid - a building block of protein - they say .
It is hoped the discovery may lead to more effective drugs to treat sleep disorders and related ailments .
The University of California study appears in the journal Nature .
People 's sleep problems tend to be very individual , but we currently have a one - size - fits - all approach
Dr Neil Stanley
Norwich University Hospital
Lead researcher Professor Paolo Sassone - Corsi said : " Because the triggering action is so specific , it appears to be a perfect target for compounds that could regulate this activity .
" It is always amazing to see how molecular control is so precise in biology . "
Sensitive mechanism
The body 's internal clock , a highly sensitive mechanism able to anticipate changes in the environment , regulates a host of body functions , from sleep patterns to metabolism and behaviour .
It is estimated that it regulates up to 15 % of all human genes .
Disruption of these rhythms can profoundly influence human health and has been linked to insomnia , depression , heart disease , cancer and neurodegenerative disorders .
The gene CLOCK and its partner BMAL1 control the body 's internal clock .
The latest study found that a single amino acid in a protein produced by BMAL1 undergoes a modification that triggers the genetic chain of events involved with setting the body 's rhythms .
The researchers found that if this modification is impaired in any way , the switching mechanism can be thrown off , undermining the whole system .
They are currently testing antibodies that can target the activity of this amino acid .
Dr Neil Stanley , a sleep expert at Norwich University Hospital , said 89 different types of sleep disorder had so far been classified , but all sleep medications - hypnotics - currently targeted the same neurotransmitter called GABA .
" People 's sleep problems tend to be very individual , but we currently have a one - size - fits - all approach - our armamentarium is not exactly huge , " he said .
" A new target may allow us to develop more specific treatments and to offer patients more personalised care . "
A spokesman for the new alliance , his face blacked out , made the announcement on a video broadcast by al - Jazeera .
He described the alliance as " the political council of the Iraqi resistance " .
The six Sunni groups have been in discussion about the move for months .
The aim is to reduce the fragmented nature of the insurgency but also to try to claim a slice of the political agenda after the expected US withdrawal .
The talks about the alliance were disclosed by the Guardian in July .
The groups had been close to making an announcement at that time but delayed because of disagreements over how to respond to the US policy of doing deals with Iraqi tribal leaders .
In a lengthy statement published yesterday , the six groups listed a 14 - point political programme , of which the first was continued action against US forces .
" The occupation of Iraq is an act of aggression and an act of gross injustice which is rejected Islamically , legally and rationally , and which all laws grant the right to oppose and resist , " it said .
It declared all laws passed by the Iraq government null and void .
The six groups are opposed to al - Qaida in Iraq , which has been behind some of the most spectacular and bloodiest attacks , often on civilians , tactics that have alienated large swaths of the Iraq population .
The main reason for the partial success of the US deals with local leaders , initially in Anbar province , is hostility towards al - Qaida .
The six groups in the alliance are the Islamic Army in Iraq , the al - Mujahideen Army , Ansar al - Sunna , al - Fatiheen Army , the Islamic Front for the Iraqi Resistance ( Jami ) , and Iraqi Hamas .
One of the biggest groups , the 1920 Revolution Brigades , had been involved in the discussions but pulled out .
A spokesman for the brigades said it had not joined the alliance because it did not want to clash with those Sunni tribal groups working with the US against al - Qaida .
" We will give time to people who have been harmed by al - Qaida and its violence , " he told the Guardian .
He denied an Economist report that the 1920 Revolution Brigades was working with the Americans .
On the contrary , the group continued to attack US troops .
The new political alliance does not recognise the government led by Nuri al - Maliki .
In its 14 - point plan it says that all laws and treaties agreed under the occupation would be rescinded .
The statement also claimed that the country would not be ruled by a " single element " that represented any ethnic or sectarian interest , presumably a reference to the Shia Muslim - dominated government .
One of the main features of the insurgency has been its fragmented nature , with diverse groups , large and small , operating largely independently .
Even with the new alliance there are still huge splits .
Outside the alliance are not only al - Qaida and the 1920 Revolution Brigades but some Sunni groups .
Also operating in Iraq are the Shia Muslim militia groups such as the Mahdi army , which has declared a six - month ceasefire , and the Badr brigades .
Guess who won ?
Indians have founded more engineering and technology companies in the U.S. during the past decade than immigrants from Britain , China , Taiwan and Japan combined ( Source : Where The Engineers Are , Vivek Wadhwa , 2007 ) .
Incredible .
The entrepreneurial abilities of Indians in general has amazed me for years .
It seems that Indian culture produces an uncommon blend of innovative thinking , business - minded aggression , and comfort with numbers .
But there is another ingredient …
Two weeks ago , I saw a screening of the film 2 Million Minutes , a new comparative documentary that examines education in the US , China , and India .
The filmmaker , Bob Compton , also wrote a book titled Blogging Through India , which I thumbed through before the movie .
Lo and behold , it contained this great little description on one of the greatest skills Indians bring to the table :
Negotiation .
###
In India , every transaction — EVERY transaction — is negotiated .
Merchandise , cab fare , restaurant bills , wedding doweries — the list is endless .
As our guide Vishnu explained , “ In India , we bargain to the level of the individual vegetable purchase . ”
While awkward and uncomfortable to most Americans , that level of negotiating can be quite valuable .
Hotmail founder Sabeer Bhatia , a CA transplant from Bangalore , credited the bargaining skills he learned in vegetable markets at home for getting Microsoft to push its acquisition price for his company from $ 160 million to $ 400 million .
Bill Gates ’ eye teeth were floating in tea with that deal .
Here are a few rules for bargaining on the buy - side when in India …
Rule # 1 –
The true price of any item is what you pay —
There are no suggested retail prices in India .
Nothing is labeled , so it pays to talk with several vendors before making a significant purchase .
Rule # 2 – Try for 70 % off —
Do n’t accept less than 30 %
Rule # 3 – Make them show lots of merchandise —
If it is a rug merchant , you want the demo guys sweating profusely before you make your first offer .
Get the vendor to “ invest ” in the transaction — emotion , time and energy .
Rule # 4 – Offer on one item at a time —
If you plan to buy a couple things DON ’T let on at the outset .
Act like you intend to buy only one item , if that much .
Get the seller to give you prices on each item ; play one item off another to show you are looking for the lower price point .
Rule # 5 – Wait for the pad of paper —
Every Indian sales person has a pad of paper and a pencil that they pull out when the bargaining gets a bit more serious .
Though they write down the price for an item , this is only the starting point – remember rule # 2 .
Rule # 6 – Say “ TOO HIGH ” , a lot —
Do n’t even start negotiating until the salesman has scratched through the initial price and lowered it at least twice .
I found that simply staring in silence at the pad of paper for a long time would result in the vendor cutting the price .
Rule # 7 – Imply a bundled purchase — OK , now that the price has been cut 25 - 30 % , ask the salesman what deal he would give you if you buy two items .
Expect 5 % off .
Ask for three items ; get another 5 % .
Then add a very expensive 4th item — one which you do not intend to buy .
This will excite the vendor and he will do a bunch of calculations which you will be unable to follow .
The price will come down for the expensive item as well as for the other items you intend to buy .
Lock those prices and drop the expensive item .
At this point , you should have been able to shave close to 50 % off the initial price .
Most Americans generally are satisfied at this point and close the deal .
One final point – no matter what price you pay — if the sales guy is smiling when you leave — guess who won …
###
Is it a stereotype that Indians are good at negotiating ?
Sure .
Is it accurate ?
Just neglect to prepare next time you match wits against an Indian entrepreneur and you tell me .
Do you have your own negotiating strategies , tips , or stories ?
If so , please share in the comments , and feel free to build on or borrow from the recommendations in the 4HWW .

Karl Rove ’s grand project to turn America into an “ ownership society ” with a permanent Republican majority has failed , sending the “ Boy Genius ” back to Texas in retirement , his political dreams dream in tatters .

In France , for example , only a quarter believe a supreme being exists ( many of them are Muslims ) , a third are outright atheists and two thirds do n’t think God exists , leaving two - thirds nonbelievers .
The Nordic countries and Japan are , if anything , more nonreligious and in no advanced nation aside from the U.S. does a majority have no doubt God exists .
According to the world Christian Encyclopedia , the number of the global nonreligious rose from a few million in 1900 to a billion in 2000 .
No religion has grown with such rapidity .
In democratic societies the great secularization has occurred almost entirely due to spontaneous voluntary conversion .
The only major faith that has grown significantly over the same period , Islam , did so mainly by rapid reproduction .
Once thought to be a paragon of traditional faith , the letters of Mother Teresa have revealed that she was a surprisingly modern woman , one with such serious doubts about the existence of God for fifty years that she stopped praying before death .
With the national mythos seeing religious faith as integral to the national character , the U.S. was the one “ first world ” country that seemed immune to popular secularization .
But survey data leaves no doubt that the nation is undergoing a delayed yet rapid secularization .
In the 1950s , Gallup data indicated that only a couple million did not believe in a supreme being , 95 % did .
Harris polls designed to discover what Americans really think about God have found that believers have declined to three quarters and atheists and agnostics make up over a fifth of the population .
Far from being a tiny minority , disbelievers number some 60 million , matching the Catholics and outnumbering Jews , Mormons , Muslims and Southern Baptists , combined , twofold .
The religious right has never been close to constituting a majority .
It makes up a most of a third of the country and it has already peaked .
Gallup polls show that Bible literalists are sinking so fast that they will soon be overtaken by Bible skeptics .
Church membership is slipping , leaving only a fifth of the nation in church on a typical Sunday morning .
Prayer is becoming less prevalent , Christians as a whole are in decline , the men are leaving the pews and youth is increasingly irreligious and progressive .
Even the mighty Southern Baptist church laments that “ evangelistically , the denomination is on a path of slow but discernable deterioration . ”
It has long been understood that popular religiosity tends to sink as education and income levels rise .
It is now understood that additional factors have sped up secularization in most first world nations .
An extensive economic safety net , including universal health care , has left most westerners so secure that few feel a need to seek the aid and protection of supernatural powers and they have abandoned the churches in droves .
America is the last advanced democracy to feel the full impact of secularization because the Republican alliance with conservative evangelicals that constitute a third of the nation and corporate interests has succeeded in preventing the adoption of a strong safety net .
Middle class Americans are in serious danger of financial ruin if they lose their job or health insurance and mobility from poverty to the middle class is unusually low by western standards .
But here ’s the twist .
The very same corporations are doing all they can to turn America into a nation of materialistic , hedonistic consumers and the public has in the main gone along with the project .
The results are plain to see on the entertainment TV that is a sea of the non-traditionalist values their corporate owners favor .
It was the retail chains that got rid of the Blue Laws that used to keep people in church on Sunday rather than at Wal - Mart and Home Depot .
When Bill O’Reilly claims that there is a war on traditional Christmas he is right , but when he blames the liberals he misses the mark .
The mercantile interests have been converting the holidays into a profit generating shopping spree since the early 1800s .
In broad terms , the anti-Darwinian religious right has had no choice but to make a deal with the socio- economically Darwinian corporate devil and it is capital that is getting the lucrative end of this bargain .
The last thing American capitalism wants is an American version of Franco ’s Spain that would severely impact their bottom line .
The wonderfully impractical scheme concocted by Rove and his allies was for America to somehow buck the universal western trend to leave its citizens even less secure by shifting assistance programs from the state to faith - based charities and private enterprise , thereby creating a perpetual church - going Republican majority founded on a perverse amalgam of traditional values for the masses and a cult of wealth for the upper class minority .
The supposed mastermind understood his old conservative base far better than the nation .
Without a solid majority , Rove had to work at the electoral margins and it ’s painfully obvious that his venture could only succeed if the U.S. was becoming more Theo - conservative .
But PEW and other surveys are finding that support for progressive polices , including universal medical coverage , is rising and even the evangelical - capital alliance is coming apart as corporations plead to be relieved of the bloated health costs that are produced by a free market health care system ( in all other “ frist ” world nations the universal systems costs far less per person and produce lower rates of juvenile and adult mortality ) .
The prognosis for the GOP ’s future is poor .
This is acknowledged by Richard Lowry in “ The Grim Truth ” which he co-authored in the November issue of his National Review .
Just how bad the right ’s situation has become is exposed by the solutions to the Republican crisis offered in the article .
They are platitudes of no practical value .
Contrary to the thesis that America will always swing back and forth between the liberal and conservative , Republicans cannot count on the trends eventually swinging back their way .
The process of democratic secularization is so powerful that once begun it has never been significantly reversed .
No strategy which the theocons devise can stop modern secular liberalism .
And the inherently conservative GOP ’s ability to adapt to the change is limited .
It is hardly likely that the party will adopt a progressive secular doctrine and if it does so , the base will be lost , wrecking the institution .
But failing to go down the progressive path threatens them with permanent minority status .
Nor are liberal and moderate theists likely to be happy with what the sociological trends are delivering .
Western secularization is , if anything , harder on progressive churches than the conservative sects , which have the advantage of forming a supposedly “ virtuous ” resistance to the temptations of modernity .
But even the evangelical churches are succumbing to materialism as a large portion of born - agains adhere to the mega- church centered Prosperity Christianity that promises its followers with wealth and comfort .
One must wonder what Rove and company were thinking when they imagined undoing long term social trends in their favor by playing the political margins .
It was like trying the turn the tide with brooms .
Far more savvy were John Judis and Ruy Teixeira who a few years ago looked at the pro-secular trends and predicted The Emerging Democratic Majority .

Let me start at the beginning , the American Revolution has just concluded and England has realized that they cannot squash the young republic with military might .
So they went to the usual bag of tricks for politicians , honors and privilege .
Though titles of nobility were prohibited by both Article VI of the Articles of Confederation ( 1777 ) and in Article I , Sect. 9 of the Constitution of the United States ( 1778 ) , the Founding Fathers saw a considerable loophole .
A loophole that today has given us Sir Rudy Giuliani , Sir Colin Powell and Sir Ronald Reagan .
It also had a secondary purpose , which would have an astounding today :
http://www.w3f.com/...
In the winter of 1983 , archival research expert David Dodge , and former Baltimore police investigator Tom Dunn , were searching for evidence of government corruption in public records stored in the Belfast Library on the coast of Maine .
By chance , they discovered the library 's oldest authentic copy of the Constitution of the United States ( printed in 1825 ) .
Both men were stunned to see this document included a 13th Amendment that no longer appears on current copies of the Constitution .
Moreover , after studying the Amendment 's language and historical context , they realized the principle intent of this " missing " 13th Amendment was to prohibit lawyers from serving in government .
So began a seven - year , nationwide search for the truth surrounding the most bizarre Constitutional puzzle in American history -- the unlawful removal of a ratified Amendment from the Constitution of the United States .
Since 1983 , Dodge and Dunn have uncovered additional copies of the Constitution with the " missing " 13th Amendment printed in at least eighteen separate publications by ten different states and territories over four decades from 1822 to 1860 .
In June of this year , Dodge uncovered the evidence that this missing 13th Amendment had indeed been lawfully ratified by the state of Virginia and was therefore an authentic Amendment to the American Constitution .
If the evidence is correct and no logical errors have been made , a 13th Amendment restricting lawyers from serving in government was ratified in 1819 and removed from our Constitution during the tumult of the Civil War .
Since the Amendment was never lawfully repealed , it is still the Law today .
The implications are enormous .
So what is in this mystery 13th Amendment :
" If any citizen of the United States shall accept , claim , receive , or retain any title of nobility or honour , or shall without the consent of Congress , accept and retain any present , pension , office , or emolument of any kind whatever , from any emperor , king , prince , or foreign power , such person shall cease to be a citizen of the United States , and shall be incapable of holding any office of trust or profit under them , or either of them . "
For those who want hard evidence , I offer up the Constitution of the United States of America , printed in 1825 in Portland , Maine :
If you want to verify this document , go here :

State Capitol - Station 84

Now the reason lawyer would have been prohibited is because the International Bar Association was charted by the King of England and headquartered in London .
So any American lawyer who uses the term Esquire would be in violation of the Constitution , Article 1 , Sect .
9 . But since there was no penalty for this , it was largely ignored .
This would also be pretty defunct today , as most of our lawyers belong to the ABA , or American Bar Association , so only fools who belong to the IBA would fall under this domain .
So basically , unless you accept a foreign title , say Knight , you will not be affected and forced to forfeit your citizenship .
But back to this lost Amendment , I bet you are asking , was it ever ratified ?
Well , here is what I found :
There were 17 states in 1810 , so 13 needed to ratify it :
Maryland , Dec. 25 , 1810
Kentucky , Jan. 31 , 1811
Ohio , Jan. 31 , 1811
Delaware , Feb. 2 , 1811
Pennsylvania , Feb. 6 , 1811
New Jersey , Feb. 13 , 1811http://www.dailykos.com/story/2007/7/10/155241/107
Vermont , Oct. 24 , 1811
Tennessee , Nov. 21 , 1811
Georgia , Dec. 13 , 1811
North Carolina , Dec. 23 , 1811
Massachusetts , Feb. 27 , 1812
New Hampshire , Dec. 10 , 1812
This makes 12 .
Then the War of 1812 broke out , and Washington burned to the ground , and all our documents with it .
But we won , of course , and we finally got back on track and according to Congressional Records on December 31 , 1817 the House of Representatives resolved that President Monroe find out about the status of the Amendment .
In a letter dated February 6 , 1818 , President Monroe reported to the House that the Secretary of State Adams had written to the governors of Virginia , South Carolina and Connecticut to tell them that the proposed Amendment had been ratified by twelve States and rejected by two ( New York and Rhode Island ) , and asked the governors to notify him of their legislature 's position .
( House Document No. 76 ) .
On February 28 , 1818 , Secretary of State Adams reported the rejection of the Amendment by South Carolina .
[ House Doc. No. 129 ] .
So it all comes down to Virginia .
There was no West Virginia at this point , keep that in mind .
On March 10 , the Virginia legislature passed Act No. 280 ( Virginia Archives of Richmond , " misc. ' file , p. 299 for micro- film ) :
" Be it enacted by the General Assembly , that there shall be published an edition of the Laws of this Commonwealth in which shall be contained the following matters , that is to say : the Constitution of the United States and the amendments thereto ... "
This act was the specific legislated instructions on what was , by law , to be included in the re-publication ( a special edition ) of the Virginia Civil Code .
The Virginia Legislature had already agreed that all Acts were to go into effect on the same day -- the day that the Act to re-publish the Civil Code was enacted .
Therefore , the 13th Amendment 's official date of ratification would be the date of re-publication of the Virginia Civil Code : March 12 , 1819 .
That makes 13 , and is officially in the Constitution .
So besides the Maine , and Virginia evidence , who else printed the now missing 13th Amendment ?
War Dept. Document from 1825 Reveals Critical Clue to Missing 13th Amendment
By The Idaho Observer ( I know , I know , quite a source PT ! )
http://www.proliberty.com/...
KANSAS CITY --
The Comfort Inn here was the third stop for Freedom Drive , 2002 , and the place where Titles of Nobility Amendment ( TONA ) researcher Suzanne Nevling of San Francisco , California produced a copy of " Military Laws of the United States to which is prefixed the Constitution of the United States . "
The book , published under authority of the War Department in 1825 , proves that the original 13th Amendment that prohibits Americans from holding Titles of Nobility , was part of the Constitution until it was mysteriously replaced with a new 13th Amendment that banned slavery after the Civil War .
" When we found this book last September we knew that we had found that the original 13th Amendment was part of the Constitution as of 1825 , " Nevling said .
Previous TONA research proves that on March 12 , 1819 , Virginia became the 13th and final state required for ratification of the original 13th Amendment when it published in the laws of Virginia Act No. 280 as passed by its legislature .
TONA research has shown that the state of Virginia forwarded copies of its revised code to the Department of State , the Congress , the Library of Congress and the President .
So , what about hardcopy ?
Ok .
Here is the Military Laws of the United States , 1825 :
It appears again in 1840 , in a Citizen 's Handbook :
Colorado has it as late as 1867 :
Kansas , 1868 , including the " 13th " Anti-Slavery Amendment listed at 14 :
The True Republican , a book published in 1841 :
The Constitution - Federalist of 1862 :
The Whig Almanac - 1845 :
There are many more .
Then something happened .
Mainly , a Civil War .
After the Civil War , this Amendment was basically dropped down the memory hole , finding the 13th Amendment we know , and love , in its place .
That was declared ratified on December 18 , 1865 , which would explain why Colorado and Kansas have our current day 13th Amendment as the 14th Amendment .
Very , very odd .
So to find a counterpoint , I thought a lawyer site would be the best , and I find a good rebuttal :
http://www.thirdamendment.com/...
Even if Virginia ratified the amendment at any time during the ratification process , the amendment did not become part of the Constitution , because the amendment was never just one state away from this threshold .
If Virginia ratified in 1819 , as extremists claim , the ratification came far too late to matter .
When the amendment was submitted to the states in 1810 , 13 ratifications were required ; Louisiana was admitted to the Union on April 30 , 1812 , raising the required number of ratifications to 14 .
Prior to that date the amendment had received only 11 ratifications New Hampshire ratified on December 9 , 1812 , raising the total number of ratifications to 12 out of the needed 14 .
But Indiana was admitted on December 11 , 1816 , raising the required number of ratifications to 15 .
Mississippi's admission on December 10 , 1817 , did not change the threshold , but Illinois 's admission on December 3 , 1818 raised the threshold to 16 .
The extremist claim that these later states are not relevant , because an amendment only needs the support of three - fourths of the states in existence when it was submitted to the states .
History reveals this claim to be specious - and this fact was known at the time the amendment was under consideration .
Whenever someone calls someone else an extremist , it 's usually because they are right about something that someone fears coming to light .
But anyway , he has a valid point about Indiana , Mississippi and Illinois .
But that goes back to when Virginia actually ratified it , as opposed to telling everyone they had .
Seems odd they would forget that they had updated the Law of the Land , but modes of communication were a lot slower back then .
But what seems even odder is all the publications that include this 13th Amendment , all the way up to 1868 .
To bad everyone involved has been dead and buried for over 150 years now , so we will never know the truth .
But if it existed , as much evidence points that it did , then it is still part of the law of the land and valid today .
Either way , makes for a hell of a story .
But going back to why they include this , in basically that they felt Article 1 , Section 9 might not be tough enough :
No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States : And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them , shall , without the Consent of the Congress , accept of any present , Emolument , Office , or Title , of any kind whatever , from any King , Prince or foreign State .
And to that effect , I give you Knight of the British Empire Rudy Giuliani , obviously a rogue to the intent and language of the Constitution .
I expect him to be deported in a fortnight as a rogue for the British Empire for subverting the law of the land in the name of a foreign power , you know , the one we fought our Revolution against .
Just thought I 'd share .
A economic study funded by the Canadian government has concluded that heavy P2P users buy more music .
* When assessing the P2P downloading population , there was " a strong positive relationship between P2P file sharing and CD purchasing .
That is , among Canadians actually engaged in it , P2P file sharing increases CD purchases . "
The study estimates that one additional P2P download per month increases music purchasing by 0.44 CDs per year .
* When viewed in the aggreggate ( ie. the entire Canadian population ) , there is no direct relationship between P2P file sharing and CD purchases in Canada .
According to the study authors , " the analysis of the entire Canadian population does not uncover either a positive or negative relationship between the number of files downloaded from P2P networks and CDs purchased .
That is , we find no direct evidence to suggest that the net effect of P2P file sharing on CD purchasing is either positive or negative for Canada as a whole . "
The Android Java SDK is nice and all , but what if you want to run some C service or code ?
Well , it turns out that this is n't exactly difficult .
You can compile an application using a standard Linux cross-compiler , install it and run your programs from the shell .
You will need a cross-compiler ( make sure you get the ARM GNU / Linux target ) .
Then you can just create your program , compile , and upload to the device :
$ arm - none - linux - gnueabi- gcc - static hello.c -o hello
$ adb push hello / hello data / hello
You can then simply run you application :
$ adb shell data / hello Hello , Android !
Now of course , this does n't at all explain how to tie into the graphics or the rest of the system , but that is left as an exercise for the reader ;)
Brian Dettmer must have a lot of time on his hands .
Or he must really love what he does .
Hopefully both , considering he says he's in his studio ten hours a day , five days a week .
Chicago - native turned Atlanta - resident Brian Dettmer is a type of book surgeon , slicing through old tomes with knives and surgical tools to transform them into an almost entirely new creation .
These volumes are stripped down to reveal a unique interpretation and composition of what laid dormant and concealed within the original structure .
Dettmer knows that we live in a fast - paced world where obsolescence is standard , especially in terms of the information we receive and how quickly it can change .
Therefore , he has taken it upon himself to redefine these outdated vessels of knowledge whose original functional purpose may no longer be applicable .
By deconstructing this media , he expands its purpose into the realm of art and recontextualizes its content .
Armed with the proper instruments for this delicate job , the meticulous dissection process begins .
He claims that a lot of what he focuses on depends on the book itself :
If he 's carving out an old science text , then it 's considered more of a dissection ; if it 's about history , then it 's more about the way the past is told and how it could be redefined .
Archaeology is an excavation process , and so on .
The task begins by sealing the book 's edges , which creates " an enclosed vessel of unearthed potential . "
From there , the heavy work begins , carving first through the cover , and then each page in order , exposing the subject 's concealed inner nature .
Nothing is ever added or altered , only stripped away to unveil newly formed compositions and relationships .
Dettmer also works with old video tapes and cassettes to construct the new from the old , melting these relics to produce works that are reincarnated with refreshed purpose .
Currently , these brillant pieces of incredibly intricate book art are on display at the Packer Schopf Gallery in Chicago .

Chief Justice Maynard did not disclose the meetings in Monte Carlo , and he did not respond to requests for comment Monday .
Image
The photos are included in a motion asking the judge to step aside in the appeal of a $ 50 million award against Massey .
Ten of the photographs attached to the motion were filed under seal .
They showed , the motion said , “ two females apparently traveling with them as companions . ”
The men are single .
The case itself was brought by mining companies that said they had been driven out of business by fraud committed by Massey .
“ Make no mistake , ” Justice Larry V. Starcher wrote in his dissent in November .
“ A West Virginia jury heard from all the witnesses for both sides , and decided that Mr. Don Blankenship directed an illegal scheme to break ” the companies .
Mr. Blankenship and his companies have attracted attention for labor disputes , workplace injuries and what environmentalists call a highly destructive form of mining called mountaintop removal that involves using explosives to blow off the tops of mountains to reach coal seams .
Hugh M. Caperton , the owner and president of Harman Development Corporation , a mining company that Massey was said to have driven out of business , said he was angry when he learned about the photographs , and doubly so when he saw the dates time - stamped on them .
“ That ’s when all the miners take their families to Myrtle Beach and Pigeon Forge , if they can , if they can afford to , ” Mr. Caperton said , referring to vacation spots in South Carolina and Tennessee .
“ They go camping at the river while the chief justice and Don Blankenship are smiling and frolicking on the French Riviera . ”
Stephen Gillers , who teaches legal ethics at New York University School of Law , said Chief Justice Maynard should not have socialized with Mr. Blankenship and should now disqualify himself from the case .
Federal judges in Manhattan , Professor Gillers said , will not even have lunch with old friends while they have cases pending in their court .
Mr. Heller was one of six plaintiffs recruited by a wealthy libertarian lawyer , Robert A. Levy , who created and financed the lawsuit for the purpose of getting a Second Amendment case before the Supreme Court .
The appeals court threw out the other five plaintiffs for lack of standing ; only Mr. Heller had actually applied for permission to keep a gun at home and been turned down .
The Supreme Court last looked at the Second Amendment nearly 70 years ago in United States v. Miller , a 1939 decision that suggested , without explicitly deciding , that the right should be understood in connection with service in a militia .
The Second Amendment provides : “ A well regulated Militia , being necessary to the security of a free State , the right of the people to keep and bear Arms , shall not be infringed . ”
The justices chose their own wording for what they want to decide in the new case , District of Columbia v. Heller , No. 07-290 .
The question they posed is whether the provisions of the statute “ violate the Second Amendment rights of individuals who are not affiliated with any state - regulated militia , but who wish to keep handguns and other firearms for private use in their homes . ”
The court ’s choice of words is almost never inadvertent , and its use of the phrase “ state - regulated militia ” was somewhat curious .
The District of Columbia , of course , is not a state , and one of the arguments its lawyers are making in their appeal is that the Second Amendment simply does not apply to “ legislation enacted exclusively for the District of Columbia . ”
For that matter , the Supreme Court has never ruled that the Second Amendment even applies to the states , as opposed to the federal government .
The court has applied nearly all the other provisions of the Bill of Rights to the states , leaving the Second Amendment as the most prominent exception .
The justices evidently decided that this case was not the proper vehicle for exploring that issue , because as a nonstate , the District of Columbia is not in a position to argue it one way or another .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
The quest by executives and venture capitalists to build a next - generation biofuels industry has made strides this year as oil reached $ 100 a barrel and the world ’s largest energy consumer laid down ambitious new mandates for alternative fuels .
Prices for the agricultural commodities that traditional biofuels are made from have soared to historic levels in recent months on global demand for both fuels and food , driving up all grain prices and hurting customers ranging from Mexican peasants to U.S. beer makers .
The price of corn , the traditional U.S. feedstock for ethanol , has hit an 11 - year high , while soy , the country ’s main ingredient in biodiesel , set a record this week , adding further incentives to kick - start non-food sources for alternative fuels .
Cellulosic ethanol , a fuel that can be made from grasses and wood pulp , holds promise , but the first trickle of that fuel into the ocean of global motor fuel is not expected for at least four years .
“ I think cellulosic ethanol will come .
The question is how high will the price of food crops have to go before it becomes profitable to use new materials to make new fuels , ” said Lester Brown , the president of the Earth Policy Institute , who had predicted last year that corn prices would spike .
The Reuters Global Agriculture and Biofuels Summit , to be held in the Americas , Asia , and Europe on January 14 and 15 , will explore these issues and more , including production wars between the world ’s biggest ethanol producers , and the struggles for profits between them and oil refiners .
The chief executive of the No. 1 U.S. ethanol company , Poet , and an executive from Archer Daniels Midland ADM.N are scheduled to give their outlooks at the summit .

The quest by executives and venture capitalists to build a next - generation biofuels industry has made strides this year as oil reached $ 100 a barrel and the world 's largest energy consumer laid down ambitious new mandates for alternative fuels .

Versun Energy Corp VSE.N , which is merging with U.S. BioEnergy Corp USBE.O to become the country 's largest ethanol company , is also lined up to participate , along with Brazil 's state oil company , Petrobras .
MANDATES
The new U.S. energy law signed by President George W. Bush late last month calls for output of ethanol made from corn to peak in 2015 and for new advanced biofuels to begin growing in overdrive that year .
By 2022 , production of U.S. biofuels made from new sources -- even garbage that contains carbon -- is mandated to overtake output of corn ethanol , and the law calls for the country to boost overall blending of biofuels five - fold to 36 billion gallons per year .
Studies have found that switchgrass , expected to be a leading fuel source for cellulosic ethanol , could cut greenhouse gas emissions much more than gasoline and fuels made from corn and sugar .
But the price of cellulosic ethanol is currently about double the price of corn - based ethanol .
Whether companies can cut the costs is uncertain .
“ Corn is still going to be grown to make ethanol .
Whether ( cellulosic ) ever takes a chunk of crop land away from corn is all going to come down to economics , ” said Ken Vogel , a researcher for the U.S. Department of Agriculture .
Nagging questions linger about the wisdom of pushing the land harder over the next few years to fuel more vehicles , whether with industrial corn in the United States or palm oil in Asia .
And other countries , such as Argentina , Colombia , and the Democratic Republic of Congo , are beginning to take part in the boom .
The sky high grain prices threaten a recovery in profit margins this year for making corn ethanol .
The smaller biodiesel industry may see new bankruptcies and closures .
But is cellulosic ethanol the answer ?
Touted as ideal to grow on marginal lands where food crops ca n’t be grown , it has received criticism from ecologists who say growing crops on such lands will lead to massive soil erosion .

I 'm still following up on the question of the way in which the Rather complaint invokes the debate on Hamdi .
I wanted to draw extended attention to this article .
In it , Tim Grieve susses out precisely what seems to be the reason Rather included the Abu Ghraib details in his complaint .
Did Clement know he was misleading the justices , or was he kept out of the loop so that he could avoid revealing truths that would undermine the administration 's " trust us " arguments in the enemy combatant cases ?
Did Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Richard Myers persuade CBS to delay broadcasting the photographs from Abu Ghraib to protect the lives of U.S. soldiers -- or to spare the administration embarrassing questions during the Supreme Court arguments in the enemy combatant cases ? [ snip ]
Clement was a natural choice to appear on behalf of Rumsfeld when the Supreme Court took up the cases of Padilla and his fellow " enemy combatant , " Yaser Hamdi , in April .
The question is , what did Clement know when he climbed the steps of the Supreme Court building on the morning of April 28 ?
Did he know what his client knew -- that the Department of Defense was investigating grave abuses at Abu Ghraib , that the brigadier general in charge of the prison had already been removed from her post ?
Did he know what his client 's staff knew -- that Joint Chiefs chairman Myers had been working to keep CBS from broadcasting photographs of the abuse ?
And we would n't be fun if we were n't remembering Monica Goodling , um , " fondly . "
The Justice Department wo n't say .
An employee in Clement 's office referred a call from Salon last week to Justice Department spokesperson Monica Goodling .
Asked what Clement or Ashcroft knew of the Abu Ghraib situation at the time of oral arguments in the Hamdi and Padilla cases , Goodling said : " We would n't have any comment . "
Pressed further , Goodling said the Justice Department would not have any comment at all about the Padilla or Hamdi cases .
I 'll remind you , Goodling was the protege of Barbara Comstock , who blackballed Eric Lichtblau for getting too close to the truth .
Go read the whole Grieve article -- I had forgotten that Padilla was argued at the same time as Hamdi .
In other words -- it may not have been Hamdi 's torture Clement was covering up , it may have been Padilla's .
The latest reports from the Stockwell Two trial , in which the Metropolitan Police are corporately in the dock for wrongly shooting dead Jean Charles de Menezes in 2005 , have it that the plods used " dum dum " bullets .
Even after all this time , the term " dum dum " still carries misty pejorative connotations in the British public mind , so here 's the Reg defence desk with a bit of background .
In essence , a hollowpoint slug - as used by the Met on de Menezes - is indeed very close to what 's understood by the term " dum dum " , though there are some minor differences .
Essentially , dumdums / softnose / hollowpoints appeared as an attempt to restore the lost messiness of wounds produced by old - time black gunpowder firearms .
The old smoke - poles threw fat , soft , fairly slow lead slugs which blew big holes in people when they hit .
When modern nitro powder came in towards the end of the 19th century , you got a lot more poke behind your bullet ; so much so that the soft lead tended to strip away on the rifling grooves inside the barrel , such that the remaining core lost its spin stabilisation and thus its accuracy .
The solution was to coat the lead projectile in tougher metal , which could survive the heat and friction generated by nitro propellant .
Such rounds are in use to this day , and their name has been made famous even to people who do n't know guns by Stanley Kubrick - it is Full Metal Jacket ( FMJ ) .
FMJ slugs , by their nature , are less prone than a soft - lead musket ball or whatever to smear and spread when they hit something .
They 're narrower too , and move faster .
They will often punch through a human or animal target and emerge on the other side still going at some speed , which is frequently seen as a waste of good kinetic energy .
Some of the first widespread users of jacketed slugs were the British , and as always happens when new kit comes in , military soreheads were soon grousing that FMJs lacked the semi-mythical quality of " stopping power " ; that is , they were less likely to knock an enemy down in one than old - school fat lead .
In response , the Dum Dum arsenal near Calcutta - the northwestern Raj being the main combat theatre of the day - tried stripping away some of the harder metal from the tip of jacketed slugs , where it was n't necessary for the bullet 's integrity during firing .
This left the soft lead core exposed , so as to spread on impact .
Different methods were tried , both at Dum Dum and later elsewhere , to encourage the bullet to mushroom open on entering a target , so as to blow a big hole like an old time Martini or Brown Bess .
These different rounds have different names - softnose , hollow point etc - but they can all fairly be described as being in the general class of expanding bullets , or " dum dums " if you will .
There was a strong backlash against expanding bullets after they came out , with many people suggesting they were in some way abhorrent or evil of themselves , and that no civilised soldier would dream of using them on a human being - certainly not a civilised human being , anyway .
This was fairly stupid , as the expanding bullets represented no more than a return to the type of trauma inflicted by the previous generation of weapons .
The stupidity was far from one - sided , however , as the original military objections to high - velocity FMJ rifle slugs were also largely rubbish .
High - powered ammo of this type does punch a small , neat entry hole compared to ( say ) a .45 Martini - Henry bullet or - god help us - a .75 Brown Bess musket ball .
It does come out the other side and take a lot of kinetic energy with it .
MOSCOW , Russia ( CNN ) -- Russia started delivering nuclear fuel to Iran 's Bushehr nuclear power plant this week as part of a compromise effort to alleviate concerns over Iran 's nuclear intentions while supporting Iran 's right to a nuclear energy program .
Russia says its fuel can only be used at and for the Bushehr plant .
Atomstroiexport , Russia 's nuclear power equipment and service export monopoly , completed the first stage of deliveries on Sunday , the Russian Federal Atomic Energy Agency said .
The head of Iran 's Atomic Energy Organization , Reza Aghazadeh , was quoted by Iran 's Fars News Agency as telling Iranian state television that the shipment arrived Monday .
The United States , several European nations , and Israel suspect Tehran has been trying to acquire nuclear weapons , but Iran denies its nuclear program is for anything but peaceful purposes .
A recent U.S. intelligence summary concluded that , contrary to earlier suspicions , Iran halted its nuclear weapons development in 2003 .
Atomstroiexport , the Russian monopoly , is building the $ 1 billion Bushehr plant under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , the United Nations ' nuclear watchdog agency .
The Russian foreign ministry and nuclear officials said the fuel delivery was under full IAEA safeguards .
" The Bushehr plant is 95 percent completed and I promise the Iranian nation that the electricity generated by this nuclear plant will enter the country 's electricity network next year , " Aghazadeh said , in comments carried by Fars .
A statement on the Russian Foreign Ministry 's official Web site Monday said Iran had provided additional written guarantees that the fuel can only be used at and for the Bushehr plant , and that the spent fuel will be returned to Russia for utilization and storage .
" The nuclear fuel is being delivered to Iran about six months ahead of the time when it will be actually used for producing energy , as stipulated by technical requirements , " the statement read .
The fuel deliveries will be made in several stages over two months , Russian nuclear officials said .
The first stage was completed , officials said , when IAEA - certified fuel containers were delivered to a special storage facility , inspected by the IAEA , at the plant .
The United States supports the Russian plan to enrich uranium on its soil , which is a compromise effort to alleviate Washington 's concerns over Iran 's nuclear intentions and Russia 's support for Iran 's right to a nuclear energy program .
President Bush said he voiced his support for the program in a phone call to President Vladimir Putin earlier this month .
" One of the interesting tactical decisions that Russia has made -- that the United States supports -- is the notion that Iran has a sovereign right to have a civilian nuclear power program , " Bush said .
" What they do n't have is our confidence that they should be able to enrich uranium so that those plants would work .
Why ?
Because they had a covert weapons program that they did not declare and have yet to declare . "
The U.N. Security Council has repeatedly demanded that Iran suspend enrichment of uranium and has imposed limited sanctions on Tehran for refusing to comply .
Russia , France , and China -- all permanent Security Council members -- have voiced concerns about the proposed sanctions .
A recent U.S. National Intelligence Estimate said Iran stopped work toward a nuclear weapon while under international scrutiny in 2003 and is unlikely to be able to produce enough enriched uranium for a bomb until 2010 to 2015 .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad hailed the report and declared that Iran is a " peaceful nuclear country . "
Aghazadeh expressed hope that with Iran - IAEA cooperation , there would no longer be any legal excuse for Iran 's nuclear case to remain at the Security Council and that it would be returned to the IAEA .
Last week , Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia wants to settle the situation .
" Certainly , we are interested in having all issues surrounding Iran 's nuclear program finally settled as early as possible , " he said in Moscow after talks with his Iranian counterpart , Manouchehr Mottaki .
This is possible " solely on the basis of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , IAEA rules and principles , and certainly , with Iran proving its right to a peaceful use of nuclear energy , " Lavrov said .
Lavrov said there had been some progress in the talks between Iran and the IAEA .
" We encourage further advancement which will allow us to finally take this issue off the international agenda , " Lavrov said .
Construction of the plant was expected to be completed in September , Interfax said , but was delayed because of lack of financing and delayed equipment deliveries from other countries .
Atomstroiexport hopes to announce a new date for completing the construction in late December , Interfax said .

CNN 's Maxim Tkachenko contributed to this report .
In his closing argument last week in the murder trial of pop music legend Phil Spector , prosecutor Alan Jackson encouraged jurors to ignore the experts who testified for the defense because , he said , “ if you hire enough lawyers who hire enough experts who are paid enough money , you can get them to say anything . ”
He went on to inform the jury that “ Phil Spector thinks if he throws enough money at a problem , he can solve the problem . ”
It was a highly unprofessional argument that encouraged jurors to dismiss the opinions of any experts who appear on behalf of wealthy defendants as , in effect , purchased testimony .
Yet the fact is that such witnesses are not only available to the rich ; even a public defender is allowed to call such witnesses , at public expense , who would probably have made the same arguments .
There is no question that there are some experts in both civil and criminal trials whose opinions invariably follow the direction of their clients .
Moreover , it was fair game for the Spector prosecutors to challenge the objectivity of forensic pathologist Michael Baden , who just happens to be married to Spector ’s trial counsel , Linda Kenney Baden .
It was breathtakingly bad judgment to call a relative to the stand as an expert , and the prosecution scored points on the issue , particularly after Michael Baden said he could not define a “ conflict of interest ” and prosecutors asked if he would end up “ sleeping on the couch ” if his testimony did not favor Spector ’s case .
Still , Jackson ’s effort to persuade the jury to disregard the defense experts as presumptively tainted was deeply inappropriate and should have resulted in a judicial rebuke in open court .
What is particularly galling about this line of argument is that it should come from a prosecutor after a litany of scandals over the years involving discredited government experts .
It is prosecutors who often hire experts to testify that any babbling or barking defendant is demonstrably sane , and experts who will claim to find a virtual portrait of a defendant in blood spatters .
These “ hired guns ” make small fortunes working for the government .
They are so predictable that they are given such nicknames as “ Dr. Death ” -- the nom de guerre of James Grigson , a psychiatrist who helped prosecutors secure 115 death sentences in 124 capital cases .
Or Fred Zain , one of the most prolific government experts .
The former chief of the West Virginia crime lab and the San Antonio medical examiner ’s office , Zain testified in countless trials and always seemed to find incriminating forensic evidence .
Zain was undone by an investigation into the case of Glen Woodall , who was sentenced to two life terms plus 300 years for two rapes .
He was tied to the rapes by Zain ’s analysis of blood and hair samples .
Years later , it was shown that Woodall was innocent , and an investigation into Zain ’s testimony found a long history of false conclusions and deceitful practices .
In 1992 , a court concluded that he may have fabricated and misrepresented evidence in almost 150 cases of conviction .
Then there is Johnny St. Valentine Brown Jr. , who was credited with testifying in roughly 4,000 trials in 14 states despite the fact that prosecutors never checked into his background to see that he had lied about his credentials .
A special prosecutor investigated leading prosecution expert Ralph Erdmann , who was found to have falsely testified in a number of Texas death penalty cases .
The investigation concluded that “ if the prosecution theory was that death was caused by a Martian death ray , then that was what Dr. Erdmann reported . ”
In the case of Louise Robbins , a North Carolina anthropologist turned prosecution witness , prosecutors found an “ expert ” willing to match boot prints to individuals with virtual certainty .
Despite the lack of scientific basis for her claims , Robbins made a lucrative career as a prosecution witness .
John Sam , a detective in the infamous case of Rolando Cruz ( who was wrongly convicted of murder and sentenced to death ) , explained how prosecutors would shop for experts :
“ The first lab guy says , ‘ It ’s not the boot . ’
We do n’t like that answer , so there ’s no paper .
We go to a second guy who used to do our lab .
He says yes .
So we write the report on Mr. Yes .
Then Louise Robbins arrives .
This is the boot , she says .
That ’ll be $ 10,000 .
So now we have evidence . ”
The list of debunked and discredited prosecution witnesses stretches across the country .
Indeed , in a study of 200 exoneration cases involving DNA ( including death row cases ) , more than 25 % involved flawed forensic testimony from prosecution witnesses .
Obviously , criminal defendants also have retained unscrupulous experts -- and when it happens , these experts should be attacked based on their backgrounds and on their opinions .
What lawyers should not do is what Jackson did -- encourage jurors to dismiss any defense experts at all as sold - out stooges .
It is the weight of the evidence , not the wealth of the defendant , that should be the sole consideration of a jury .
The great irony is that Jackson and his colleagues had little need to engage in cheap tactics .
The case against Spector is overwhelming , and even though he has n’t testified , he has supplied the jury with one of the most creepy appearances and lifestyles in recent memory .
Yet this was not enough for the prosecutors , who sought to prove the guilt of the defendant by pandering to the prejudices of the jury against wealthy defendants .
Jonathan Turley is a law professor at George Washington University and a practicing criminal defense attorney who has also served as a legal expert on malpractice issues .

STANFORD , California ( Reuters ) -
The more wine costs , the more people enjoy it , regardless of how it tastes , a study by California researchers has found .
Researchers at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and the California Institute of Technology found that because people expect wines that cost more to be of higher quality , they trick themselves into believing the wines provide a more pleasurable experience than less expensive ones .
Their study , published on Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , says that expectations of quality trigger activity in the medial orbitofrontal cortex , the part of the brain that registers pleasure .
This happens even though the part of our brain that interprets taste is not affected .
While many studies have looked at how marketing affects behavior , this is the first to show that it has a direct effect on the brain .
The researchers said that when 20 adult test subjects sampled the same wine at different prices , they reported experiencing pleasure at significantly greater levels when told the wine cost more .
At the same time , the part of the brain responsible for pleasure showed significant activity .
“ We have known for a long time that people ’s perceptions are affected by marketing , but now we know that the brain itself is modulated by price , ” said Baba Shiv , an associate professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business , and one of the authors of the study .
“ Marketers are now going to think twice about reducing the price , ” Shiv said .
According to the study , if an experience is pleasurable , the brain will use it to help guide future choices .
That conclusion has important implications for marketing that aims to influence perceptions of quality such as expert ratings , peer reviews , information about country of origin , store and brand names and repeated exposure to advertisements .
Want to make bread into toast in under a minute ?
This Turbo Toaster prototype by Oliver Newberry of London can do just that , provided you 're okay with the noise that two huge jet engine - like fans blowing hot air onto the toast will make .
The inspiration for this invention ?
The fact that his beans became cold before the toast was done heating up .
To this , we have two things to say .
One , who eats beans on toast ?
And two , why not just wait until your toast is done to make your beans ?

N.F.L. vs. M.L.B. as a Labor Market : A Freakonomics Quorum
It ’s a widely held perception that the professional athletes who constitute Major League Baseball and the National Football League have different levels of power — i.e. , players have more juice in M.L.B. , while it ’s a team ’s ownership that has more power in the N.F.L. , often at the expense of individual players .
Is this true ?
We put this question to a handful of insiders : Vince Gennaro , Darren Rovell , Stan Kasten , and Andrew Zimbalist .
Here are their responses :
Vince Gennaro , sports consultant and author of Diamond Dollars : The Economics of Winning in Baseball :
The radically different business models of the “ egalitarian ” N.F.L. and the “ Darwinian ” M.L.B. favor different constituents .
With less variability in its revenue streams and a salary cap limiting player compensation , the N.F.L. structure tends to favor the owners .
Meanwhile , the M.L.B. model leads to more revenue risk , and allows greater leverage and thus greater compensation for players .
Pro football teams engage in a “ national ” business , with national broadcast rights making up the largest portion of their revenue stream .
As such , about 80 percent of the nearly $ 7 billion of the N.F.L. ’s annual revenues are divided evenly among all 32 teams .
Before the New York Giants or Kansas City Chiefs ever play a game , they ’re each entitled to about $ 150 million in annual revenue .
According to a Forbes estimate , all but one N.F.L. team brought in between $ 182 and $ 255 million in 2006 ( only the Redskins exceeded $ 300 million ) .
With the Jets and Giants in the middle of the pack , earning less revenue than Tampa Bay , Carolina , or Denver , it is clear that market size has little impact on the revenue base of an N.F.L. club .
By contrast , an M.L.B. team is essentially a local business .
Less than 25 percent of all revenues are distributed evenly among the 30 teams .
More than three - quarters of the $ 6 billion in annual revenues are earned and kept at the local level , with a disproportionate share going to teams in large markets with strong team brands and greater on - field success .
Unlike the stable , “ money - in - the - bank ” revenues of an N.F.L. team , the primary revenues of a baseball team – attendance , ticket price increases , luxury suite rentals , and local broadcast ratings and subsequent rights fees — can rise and fall with winning and losing seasons .
( I discuss these nuances in depth in my book , Diamond Dollars . )
I ’d estimate the 2007 Yankees generated nearly $ 400 million in annual revenue , while the Tampa Bay Devil Rays barely generated $ 100 million .
We need only to look at broadcast ratings of the two leagues ’ respective championships to underscore this local - national dichotomy between baseball and football .
The Super Bowl ’s broadcast ratings have virtually no connection to the participating teams , while World Series ratings rise and fall with the size of the market of the N.L. and A.L. champs .
Whereas both leagues have seen solid appreciation in franchise values in recent years , the lower variability associated with N.F.L. revenues and costs yield a more favorable risk adjusted return than the up - and - down fortunes of an M.L.B. owner .
Baseball tends to favor the players , both stars and journeymen alike , with higher compensation , longer careers , and contracts that are guaranteed in the event of an injury .
Also , because baseball is without a salary cap and many teams depend on winning to drive the revenue engine , owners tend to award lavish contracts to an impact player in the hopes that he will carry the team deep into October , unlocking future revenues .
Baseball ’s Alex Rodriguez has agreed to a contract worth nearly $ 30 million per year , while N.F.L. stars Peyton Manning and Tom Brady each make about $ 10 million per year .
So it may pay to groom your young one to become a big league baseball player , but be sure to tell him to invest his spoils in the ownership of an N.F.L. team .
Darren Rovell , a CNBC sportswriter and commentator :
This perception comes , of course , from the the fact that , over a period of the last three decades , the baseball union has clearly beaten the owners in labor negotiations while championing free agency and avoiding a salary cap , while N.F.L. players play their brutal , most profitable game under the cap system without the guaranteed contracts that exist in the other sports .
Case in point : this offseason , Alex Rodriguez ’s 10 - year , $ 275 million contract guarantees him more than nine times more than any N.F.L. player makes in his contract .
Despite some recent power shifts in these player - owner dynamics ( more extensive drug testing by the baseball owners ; the ability of the N.F.L. union to get higher payouts thanks to tying salaries to a higher percentage of revenues , the definition of which includes more line items than ever before ) the perception is the reality .
Perhaps a more intriguing question to consider is , “ Why , from an economic perspective , could this be ? ”
After all , we ca n’t simply credit the fact that the baseball union negotiators and the N.F.L. owner negotiators are just better over so many years .
Thus , it ’s worth bringing up at least two factors that explain why the upper hand might “ naturally ” exist in both cases .
1 . Scarcity .
The baseball union could have greater leverage because professional baseball players are more scarce .
Baseball has 25 professional players on each of their 30 rosters .
N.F.L. teams carry more than double ( 53 players per team ) that amount of players on their 32 rosters .
2 . Turnover .
So many are surprised by the fact that the N.F.L. does n’t have guaranteed contracts .
Well , guaranteed contracts make a little bit more sense in M.L.B. than in the N.F.L. , where the average player plays about three and half seasons , roughly two seasons shorter than the average Major Leaguer .
This could be because of injuries , or perhaps because owners and team personnel think the difference between a veteran and a cheap drafted rookie is minimal .
Both of these factors could lead one to conclude that M.L.B. owners are forced to care more about cultivating a relationship with their players , while N.F.L. owners , on a larger scale , can afford to tell their players why it ’s still so good for them in the N.F.L .
Stan Kasten , president of the Washington Nationals :
I ca n’t say that I would agree with this statement .
I think all teams , in all professional sports , are run along similar principles , and these principles are essentially the same as those used by successful companies outside of the sports world .
Every team needs a clear leadership structure , with the best possible people in every position , from owner to third - string player .
There also needs to be a distinct vision in each organization , clearly communicated throughout the ranks , in order to achieve the desired results — in our case , winning .
Professional baseball may have greater individual player identification than football , but this is largely due to structure — baseball has only twenty five players per team , compared with double that for football .
Many football players play positions which , though important , are n’t nearly as readily visible as the positions on the baseball field .
( For this reason , basketball players are even more visible . )
And let ’s not forget the all - encompassing football uniforms , which obscure the faces of all but the most celebrated stars .
Still , I really do n’t think the role , effectiveness , or impact of N.F.L. owners is fundamentally different from M.L.B. owners .
And let ’s face it : the most well - known owners are mostly so well - known because they ’re also active as GMs .
But have you ever heard of a fellow named George Steinbrenner ?
Andrew Zimbalist , professor of economics at Smith College and author of several books on sports economics , including May the Best Man Win : Baseball Economics and Public Policy ( co- authored with Bob Costas ) :
EARLIER this year , when Lance Winters heard that absinthe was being sold in the United States again for the first time since 1912 , he shrugged it off .
Then he reconsidered .
He ’d spent 11 years perfecting an absinthe at St. George Spirits , the distillery where he works in Alameda , Calif. , and considered it one of the best things he ’d ever made .
Why not sell it ?
Over the past few months , he must have wished he ’d stuck to his first instinct .
The division of the Treasury Department that approves alcohol packaging sent back his label seven times , he said .
They thought it looked too much like the British pound note .
They wondered why it was called Absinthe Verte when their lab analysis said the liquid inside was amber .
Mostly , it seemed to him , they did n’t like the monkey .
“ I had the image of a spider monkey beating on a skull with femur bones , ” Mr. Winters said .
But he said that the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau thought the label “ implied that there are hallucinogenic , mind - altering or psychotropic qualities ” to the product .
“ I said , ‘ You get all that just from looking at a monkey ? ’ ”
His frustration came to a sudden end last Wednesday , when he learned the agency had finally granted approval to his St. George Absinthe Verte , the first American - made absinthe on the market in almost a century .
( Fortune Magazine ) -- China , Long recognized as the world 's factory , is earning a new distinction : America 's banker .
As it continues to suck in foreign investment and crank out exports , the world 's fastest - growing economy is piling up foreign currency , mostly dollars , at an astonishing rate .
In April , China 's central bank stunned economists with the disclosure that , in the first three months of the year , China had added $ 136 billion to its official foreign - currency reserves , more than double the increase in the previous quarter .
The influx boosted China 's foreign reserves to $ 1.2 trillion - an Everest of money that towers over reserves held by any other nation .
Beijing 's burgeoning foreign - cash pile is a consequence of its effort to boost exports by fixing the value of its currency , the yuan , to the U.S. dollar .
To keep the yuan from appreciating too quickly , the central bank buys up dollars brought to China by foreign investors and Chinese exporters .
Then the bank issues bonds to mop up the yuan it has paid for those dollars , thus warding off inflation .
It 's a complicated arrangement , made more so as the sums in question soar .
By any sensible measure , Beijing 's stash is excessive .
James McCormack , an analyst at Fitch Ratings , the credit agency , calculates that at the end of 2006 , China held reserves worth nearly nine times its short - term debt , or 14 months of imports .
China 's reserves exceed even the most dire estimates of bad loans held by the nation 's banks .
But managing this hoard is a growing headache .
In Internet chatrooms , Chinese have begun asking why Beijing can't use the money to build schools and hospitals rather than to prop up the U.S. dollar .
Policymakers , meanwhile , fret that the reserves are earning poor returns .
In March , Finance Minister Jin Renqing announced plans to launch a new investment fund charged with managing the reserves in a more profitable and efficient manner .
The fund is to be led by Lou Jiwei , a respected former finance vice minister .
But nearly everything else about it - including how much money it will control and where it will invest - remains a mystery .
Word of the fund provoked consternation in financial markets .
" There 's a new fin in the water , and no one knows whether it's a great white , a [ harmless ] basking , or [ some other ] species of shark , " wrote Standard Chartered Bank economist Stephen Green in a note to clients .
China 's new fund " will be huge , and it could move markets , blowing up well - thought - out trades with the touch of a bureaucrat 's button . "
Where will the money go ?
Chinese press reports suggest that the fund will be modeled on Temasek , the Singaporean government 's investment arm , and entrusted with as much as $ 300 billion .
That 's three times the size of Temasek and ten times larger than the world 's largest hedge fund .
With that much under management , the fund could buy up Wal - Mart ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) and have enough left over to pick up General Motors ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) and Ford ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) .
Many analysts expect that the new fund will look for ways to lighten China 's holdings of dollar - denominated assets , particularly low - yielding U.S. Treasury bonds .
At the end of 2006 , China held $ 350 billion worth of T - bills .
Fitch estimates that China holds another $ 230 billion in bonds from government - backed agencies such as Freddie Mac ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) and Fannie Mae ( Charts ) .
Others predict the fund will bankroll efforts of state - owned resource giants like Sinopec or CNOOC to secure oil , gas , coal and other raw materials abroad .
But Arthur Kroeber , editor of the China Economic Quarterly , argues that Beijing will find it difficult to achieve either goal .
Few assets offer the depth and liquidity of T - bills .
And any effort to finance acquisitions by Chinese companies risks igniting the sort of controversy that scuttled CNOOC 's bid for Unocal .
" As a practical matter , " warns Kroeber , " a state - controlled fund of this size will face problems nearly every way it turns . "
Some U.S. lawmakers have expressed concern that China might exploit its status as a major buyer of U.S. Treasury bonds to gain leverage in trade or foreign - policy disputes .
But China itself would suffer from any redeployment of reserves that might undercut growth in the U.S. , its No. 1 consumer .
At his annual press conference in March , Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao acknowledged the immense foreign reserves as a " new problem for us . "
But he went out of his way to assert that the new fund 's first principle would be to do no harm .
" China 's formation of an investment company for its foreign - exchange reserves will not affect U.S. - dollar assets , " he said .
In a recent letter to Senator Richard Shelby ( R - Alabama ) , U.S. Fed chairman Ben Bernanke said much the same thing , arguing that Beijing could n't damage the U.S. economy by selling bonds or boycotting Treasury auctions because " foreign holdings of U.S. Treasury securities represent only a small part of total U.S. credit - market debt outstanding . "
Bernanke also said that the Fed could adjust interest rates .
Even so , China 's dollar mountain seems sure to grow if exports maintain their recent pace .
China 's global trade surplus jumped $ 46 billion in the first quarter ; its surplus with the U.S. topped $ 232 billion in 2006 .
The fuss about China 's reserves could blow over if , as UBS economist Jonathan Anderson predicts , higher wages , rising inflation and gradual appreciation of the yuan curb export growth .
But that 's a minority view .
Standard Chartered 's Green sees continued trade surpluses and expects China 's foreign - currency holdings to grow at a rate of about $ 20 billion a month .
Credit Suisse economist Dong Tao says China 's foreign reserves could top $ 2 trillion by the end of next year .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson will have a chance to ask how much longer Chinese leaders think this wad of dollars can keep growing when he welcomes a delegation led by Vice Premier Wu Yi to Washington , D.C. , in May .
For now , however , perhaps the sign on his desk should bear a modern alternative to Harry Truman 's favorite motto :
The buck stops ... in Beijing .
Why it 's harder than you think to pass up ' deadly ' salt
Houstonian Diane Fries did what any conscientious patient would do when her doctor told her she had high blood pressure : she got rid of her salt shaker and stopped eating foods obviously high in sodium .
But the change had little effect .
The problem , Fries eventually learned , is the salt in processed food and restaurant cuisine , the unsuspected ingredient in everything from salad dressings to breads to cheeses .
When she began paying attention to it , her blood pressure went down .
" There 's so much hidden salt in food people are n't aware of , " said Fries , a lifelong Texan who describes herself as having grown up on fried foods and salt .
" You just do n't think of it normally . "
Health officials are trying to change that .
The American Medical Association has launched a public - awareness campaign about the hidden salt in people 's diets and the Food and Drug Administration is mulling regulating what one consumer advocacy group dubbed " the deadly white powder . "
The goal is to cut sodium intake by half over the next decade , which health officials say could save as many as 150,000 lives annually .
One official says the death toll from America 's excessive salt consumption is the equivalent of " a jumbo jet with more than 400 passengers crashing every day of the year , year after year . "
' Sodium overload '
The matter is not without controversy .
Some people are more sensitive to the harmful effects of salt than others , and there 's no real way to figure out if you 're one of them .
Food manufacturing officials , who say there are no great alternatives to salt in processed foods , argue there is n't evidence to justify a campaign against the simple mineral .
They call for a voluntary approach .
It is almost impossible to prepare a meal without salt — it preserves food by inhibiting bacterial growth , offers technical advantages in the kitchen such as raising the boiling point of water , and , as one of the four taste categories , adds flavor or heightens existing flavor .
But health officials say there 's an indisputable link between sodium and hypertension , which often does n't cause obvious symptoms , but if left untreated can lead to heart attack and stroke .
Of the 65 million Americans believed to have high blood pressure , about one third are n't aware of it .
" What is clear is that people are getting a sodium overload , " says Dr. James Rohack , a Texas A&M Health Science Center cardiologist .
" And in large population studies , reductions in that overload have reduced blood pressure , saving lives . "
Salt 's role in history
Suspicions about salt are not new .
In 2,500 B.C. , physicians in China warned patients that if they used too much , their " pulse " would harden .
Today , doctors say bodies react to sodium by holding onto more water .
That extra water increases the volume of blood flowing through the blood vessels , which in turn raises blood pressure .
For such a simple substance , common salt has had a complex past .
Once scarce , it was considered as precious as gold , valued as an agent to clean , dye , soften leather and bleach .
It also came to be recognized as an essential part of people 's diets , necessary for many body functions : fluid balance , nerve conduction , blood clotting and muscle contraction .
How much is too much ?
But the amount needed is minor .
The average American now consumes about 4,000 milligrams of sodium a day , up from about 2,300 milligrams in the early 1970s , the last time it matched the amount health officials say can be safely ingested .
That 2,300 milligrams of sodium , equivalent to a teaspoon , is an upper limit , say experts .
An adequate intake is 1,500 milligrams for people ages 9 to 50 ; 1,300 for people 50 to 70 ; and 1,200 for those over 70 .
The majority of the excess sodium in modern diets — 77 percent — comes from processed foods and restaurant cuisine .
It can turn up in the least expected places .
A Starbucks cheese danish contains 750 milligrams .
Chipotle 's vegetarian burrito contains 2,270 milligrams .
Currently , the nutrition label on packaged foods says how much salt is in a serving .
But it does n't explicitly note whether the amount is particularly high .
The AMA says any food containing more than 480 milligrams of sodium per serving should be considered a high sodium food .
" We 'd like the FDA to require warning labels on food products , a simple system like traffic lights , " says Dr. Stephen Havas , the AMA 's vice president for science , quality and public health .
" High sodium content would get a red light , medium would get a yellow and low would get a green . "
The FDA last looked at regulating salt in 1982 , when it rejected the idea of revoking its " generally recognized as safe " status .
At the time , it said it would be " extremely difficult " to prescribe and enforce fair limits that would be safe for all .
It is taking input in the matter again now at the request of the AMA and the Center for Science in the Public Interest .
Worldwide efforts
Food industry officials argue that studies have shown salt reductions bring only modest reductions in blood pressure .
That is perhaps because salt affects people differently — the largest reductions were among those with high blood pressure .
Although some food companies have voluntarily lowered sodium content — ConAgra estimates that in the past four years it 's removed 2.8 million pounds from items such as Chef Boyardee and Marie Callender 's — but others have done just the opposite .
One survey found that between 1994 and 2004 , the sodium content of food increased by 6 percent .
In any event , the issue is n't confined to the U.S. The World Health Organization has called for world sodium reduction in processed foods , and countries such as Finland and Britain are well into campaigns .
In the United States , the FDA is keeping its cards close to the vest .
" The docket will be open until March , " said FDA spokesman Michael Herndon .
" Beyond that , we can't speculate on any likely decision . "

Blackwater president acknowledges guards sometimes fire first David Edwards and Nick Juliano

The chairman of Blackwater USA , which is facing intense scrutiny over the deaths of a dozen Iraqi civilians last month , defended his private security contractors working in Iraq , while Republicans worked to paint the hearing as little more than an attempt for Democrats to score partisan points .
In sworn testimony Erik Prince , a former Navy SEAL who founded Blackwater , acknowledged that his guards sometimes will fire first on Iraqis in an attempt to prevent " potential car bombs , " although he insisted the contractors follow a strict protocol before resorting to lethal force .
The House Oversight Committee met in the wake of a Sept. 16 shooting during which Blackwater guards are alleged to have been unprovoked when they opened fire on a crowd of Iraqis , killing between 11 and 20 civilians .
Details of that incident were not directly addressed Tuesdsay in order because of fears such a discussion could taint ongoing investigations by the FBI and State Department .
The shooting drew intense scrutiny to the company and provoked Iraq 's government to move to expel its contractors from the country .
Several committee members pressed Prince to clarify the rules of engagement and standard operating procedures that govern Blackwater guards .
A report released Monday by the committee 's Democratic staff found that Blackwater guards fired first in more than 80 percent of the 195 " escalation of force " incidents since 2005 .
Although Prince said they only use force defensively , Blackwater guards have the authority to fire on " potential car bombs " that they deem to be a threat .
Because insurgents have devised such effective weapons in targeting US troops and contractors with explosives - packed vehicles , contractors view every car that gets within 100 meters as a potential threat , Prince said .
" The bad guys have figured out how to make precision weapon , " he said .
" You take a car , you pack it with explosives , and you find a suicidal person who wants to drive it into the back of a convoy . "
The following video is from CNN.com , broadcast on October 2 , 2007 .

Prince outlined several steps beginning with Blackwater convoys sounding air horns and flashing their lights and sirens and firing " non-lethal " flares at vehicles approaching at high speeds .
If cars continue to approach , he said , guards will sometimes fire at an approaching vehicle 's radiator or windshield , away from passengers , and if that fails to stop them Blackwater guards will open fire on the driver .
Prince said Blackwater guards follow the rules of engagement that govern State Department and Defense Department security contractors , although he specified that American troops are held to a different standard .
" We do not have the same as a US soldier at all , " he said .
Republican calls hearing ' repeat ' of MoveOn ' attack ' Rep. Darrell Issa ( R - CA ) compared Tuesday 's House Oversight Committee hearing on the role of Blackwater USA guards in the deaths of innocent Iraqis with a nearly month - old advertisement attacking Gen. David Petraeus , the commander of US troops in Iraq .
" I think it 's been made incredibly clear by ... the Democrat side that this is not about Blackwater , " Issa said in his opening statement .
" What we 're hearing today is in fact a repeat of the MoveOn.org attack on Gen. Petraeus 's patriotism .
...
What they could n't do to our men and women in uniform , they 'll simply switch targets . "
The video is from CNN.com , broadcast on October 2 , 2007 .

Issa qualified his statement saying he was not " here to protect Blackwater , " and he accused Democrats of using the hearing to re-debate whether the US should have gone into the war in the first place .
( Other than a few asides from the panel 's most liberal members , questioning focused exclusively on Blackwater 's actions . )
Along with Issa's MoveOn red herring , other GOP committee members invoked the previous military service of most Blackwater contractors in attempting to deflect criticism .
Rep. Patrick McHenry ( R - NC ) said the " former soldiers " now working for Blackwater were serving with honor in Iraq , and Rep. John Mica ( R - FL ) moved that the committee adjourn before testimony even began because " they 're really going after Blackwater , " he said , an apparent reference to the panel 's Democrats , and he accused the hearing of potentially interfering with investigations by the State and Justice departments .
Blackwater is on ' our team , ' says GOP lawmaker Rep. Michael Turner ( R - OH ) continued comparing criticisms of Blackwater to assaults on the military , and he chastised the Oversight Committee Democrats for not calling a hearing to express similar " indignation " at insurgents and al Qaeada fighters killing Americans in Iraq .
( Such a hearing likely would not fall under the committee 's jurisdiction . )
He said oversight of Blackwater was fine , as long as inquries did not undermine the company 's work in Iraq on America 's behalf .
Congress needs to keep in mind " who 's on our team and who 's on their team , " Turner said .
" I think ( the hearing ) crosses the line between our team and their team . "

One is credited with dreaming up the technological innovation that has arguably done most to transform our lives in recent years ; the other is behind a cartoon about a custard - hued family in middle America .
Yet both the worldwide web founder , Tim Berners - Lee , and the Simpsons creator , Matt Groening , are among the world 's top 10 living geniuses , according to a report which ranks individuals according to their " genius factor " .
It used a scoring system to assess contenders on how much their contribution had turned conventional thinking on its head , the popular acclaim they received , their intellectual power , their achievements and their cultural importance .
The top 100 features not just brainiacs and boffins , but 19 musicians , two artists ( Damien Hirst and the illustrator Robert Crumb ) and one sportsman ( Muhammad Ali ) .
He is joined at number 43 by a surprise entry : Osama bin Laden .
The British computer scientist Berners - Lee shares the top spot with Albert Hofmann , the 101 - year - old Swiss chemist best known for synthesising LSD .
Groening is at number four - one place ahead of Nelson Mandela .
Stephen Hawking took seventh position .
Other names in the top 100 , of whom only 15 are women , include Steven Spielberg , Richard Branson , Prince , Aretha Franklin and Morrissey .
Twenty - three are British .
The global consulting business Synectics , which compiled the list , asked 4,000 people in the UK to nominate up to 10 living people they considered to qualify as a genius .
After removing candidates who were dead , unidentifiable , or who turned out to be self - nominations , they ended up with more than 400 people .
A panel of six consultants whittled them down to 100 , giving them a score out of 10 for each of the five factors .
The highest ranked got 27 out of 50 , while the 100th had a genius factor of two out of 50 .
Top 10
1= Albert Hofmann ( Swiss ) chemist ( genius factor 27 )

( CNN ) -- Political analysts expect that Al Gore 's Nobel Peace Prize win will increase the pressure on him to run for president .
Ole Danbolt Mjos , chairman of the Nobel committee , displays a picture of Al Gore in Oslo , Norway , on Friday .
But those who know him well predict he 'll resist the pressure and stay out of the race .
The former vice president and the United Nations ' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change won the honor early Friday for their work in drawing attention to global climate change .
Gore gave no hint of any political plans when he made a statement to reporters Friday .
" I will be doing everything I can to try to understand how to best use the honor and recognition of this award as a way of speeding up the change in awareness and the change in urgency , " he said .
" I 'm going back to work right now .
This is just the beginning . "
Gore left the room without answering reporters ' questions , including a shout of " Are you running for president ? "
One source , who has been involved in Gore 's political campaigns , told CNN that he wo n't get into the race for the Democratic presidential nomination because he does n't want to battle Sen.
Hillary Clinton of New York .
Gore would have given serious consideration to a run if Clinton 's campaign had run into problems , the source said , but he has concluded her momentum is unstoppable .
" If she faltered , I think Democrats would probably turn to Al Gore because their argument is , ' Of course he 's electable -- he 's been elected , ' " said CNN senior political analyst Bill Schneider .
But Schneider said he thought Gore 's response would be that he had no interest in running .
A Gore adviser made a similar prediction to Slate.com 's John Dickerson .
" The view this morning is this will be energy he can just channel back into this cause he cares so much about , " said Dickerson , a CNN political analyst .
Time magazine 's Eric Pooley , who has reported extensively on Gore and his environmental efforts , makes the same prediction , but for a different reason .
" Running for president would mean returning to a role he 'd already transcended , " Pooley wrote on Time 's Web site .
" He 'd turn into -- again -- just another politician , when a lot of people thought he might be something better than that . "
Former President Carter , a Nobel Peace Prize winner in 2002 , said on NBC's " Today " show Friday that he considered Gore the most qualified person to be president and that he hoped the Nobel Prize " might lead him to consider another political event . "
" I 've called Al Gore and urged him to run for president so many times , " Carter said on " Today . "
" He finally told me the last time , ' President Carter , please do not call me any more . ' "
Carter added , " I can at least do it indirectly through the news media . "
Some of the candidates who would be Gore 's rivals if he joined the race offered congratulations and praise .
" The Nobel Peace Prize rewards three decades of Vice President Gore 's prescient and compelling -- and often lonely -- advocacy for the future of the Earth , " said a statement from former Sen. John Edwards .
Sen . Barack Obama of Illinois said in a statement , " By having the courage to challenge the skeptics in Washington and lead on the climate crisis facing our planet , Al Gore has advanced the cause of peace and richly deserves this reward . "
Sen . James Inhofe of Oklahoma , who has called global warming a hoax , issued a statement saying , " I congratulate former Vice President Al Gore even though we disagree on the issue .
I would hope that they use the funds associated with the award for something useful , such as providing for malaria shots in Africa or clean water projects in the developing world . "
Gore has said repeatedly this year that he does n't " have any plans to be a candidate again . "
But a group called draftgore.com apparently is hoping to change his mind .
The organization , which describes itself as a group of grass - roots Democrats , took out a full - page ad in Wednesday 's New York Times .
Watch how the group is trying to persuade Gore to run »
Its open letter urges the 2000 Democratic presidential nominee to enter the 2008 race for the White House , saying " your country needs you now , as do your party , and the planet you are fighting so hard to save . "
The letter goes on to say that " America and the Earth need a hero right now , someone who will transcend politics as usual and bring real hope to our country and to the world . "
The ad also states that 136,000 people have signed Draft Gore 's online petition .
Eva Ritchey , from the Draft Gore campaign , said the signatures are coming in by the thousands .
She also said the group will start a radio campaign in Florida .
Gore spokeswoman Kalee Kreider said the former vice president " truly appreciates the heartfelt sentiment behind the ad ; however , he has no intention of running for president . "
But some Democrats are n't giving up .
In the most recent CNN - Opinion Research Corp. national poll , 13 percent of Democrats surveyed supported Gore for their party 's presidential nomination .
In the poll , he was in fourth place in the Democratic race , two percentage points behind former Edwards and seven points behind Obama , and ahead of five declared candidates .
Clinton leads the poll with 39 percent .
Even if Gore changed his mind and decided to join the fray , the clock is ticking on any run for the White House .
" Gore would certainly shake up the race if he changed his mind and decided to get in , but less than three months before the Iowa caucuses , his window of opportunity to actually make a serious run for the Democratic nomination probably has passed him by , " said CNN political editor Mark Preston .
Gore was vice president under President Clinton .
In 2000 , he won the Democratic presidential nomination and faced Texas Gov. George W. Bush in the general election campaign .
Gore won the popular vote but lost the electoral vote after the U.S. Supreme Court denied his challenge of voting results in the key state of Florida .
" An Inconvenient Truth , " a 2006 documentary featuring the former vice president , captured two Academy Awards in February .
The film focuses on Gore and his worldwide travels to educate the public about the severity of global warming .
Last month Gore picked up an Emmy -- the highest award in television -- for " Current TV , " which he co-created .
The show describes itself as a global television network that gives viewers the opportunity to create and influence its programming .

The iPhone was launched back in the summer
The move follows criticism that Apple was previously not allowing outsiders to make programs that would run easily on the popular mobile phone .
Last month Apple warned iPhone users not to hack into the gadget to install unauthorised programs .
Apple said that such moves would render the phones " permanently inoperable " when it releases software updates .
' Vibrant community '
" We are excited about creating a vibrant third party developer community around the iPhone and enabling hundreds of new applications for our users , " said Mr Jobs .
He added that it would take until February to release a software development kit ( SDK ) , as Apple both wanted to " provide an advanced and open platform " , at the same time as protecting iPhone users from viruses and privacy attacks .
The SDK will also allow developers to make applications for the iPod touch , which uses the same underlying architecture as the iPhone .
Apple has played a cat and mouse game with hackers since the phone 's launch , with programmers battling the protection on the device in order to install third - party programs , such as games emulators , net telephony applications and turning the gadget into a remote control .
Apple has also faced criticism that iPhone users cannot choose their phone network .
Instead , those in the US have to use AT&T , while UK users are tied to 02 .
In France the iPhone will have to be sold with and without a contract , according to the country 's laws .
Orange is the exclusive carrier for the phone but under French law phones must also be supplied unlocked for use on other networks .
Why does anybody think the information on B. Bhutto , assassinated yesterday , is anymore truthful than anything presented in the major media ?
It 's too bad she 's dead - but it was her own doing - lap dog that she was to Washington - meeting with CFR - and falling ( or maybe threatened ? ) for their plans for her .
Musharref is a dud - he is about two things : staying alive and staying in power .
Little wonder ... this prick of a dictator sure lives in style on the BILLIONS that we 've poured into Pakistan .
Little wonder that there 's NO money here at home with the BILLIONS that Washington is showering the whole mid-east with .
Do n't lionize Bhutto - she is NOT what the media is presenting ( latest distraction ) ... an aristocrat who cares for the poor of Pakistan .
Hardly .
She did ZERO for them during her two terms as Prime Minister - where she lived in a $ 50 million dollar mansion .
Ms. Bhutto comes from a very wealthy Pakistani family ( feudal landlord ) .
She went to Radcliff - Harvard - Oxford .
The officals in Pakistan ( including Prime Minister ) live high on the hog amidst such dire poverty !
Ms. Bhutto lived in a $ 50 million dollar mansion , talking about the poor .
As Prime Minister she did zero .
Just a fact - she 's who the media has created her to be for this MOMENT in time - and people are buying it .
All a distraction .
Before becoming maudlin over her death ( any death is tragic - many others died besides her ) - you should take the TIME to read what Amy Goodman - Democracy Now ( one trusted news source ) and her interview with Tarqui Ali ( Pakistani historian ) .
Tarqui should know - NOT these talking PR heads on TV who 've never been to Pakistan !
Also , if you want to be informed ( Google ) take the time to read the in - depth ( great ) expose that was done Jan 9,1998 - New York Times , ' House of Graft : Tracing the Bhutto Millions ' .
Now there 's a story for you -- $ 1.3 billion siphoned out of Pakistan by Bhutto ( husband Asif Zardari ) - documented by Swiss accounts - investigations by Interpol - France - Spain - and the UK .
Ms. Bhutto's husband was known as Mr. 10 % because of the graft he took on all government contracts !
One of their homes - gated mansion community in Dubai
They have homes everywhere - including a 350 acre estate in the UK , a mansion in Dubai on the Arabian Sea , etc .
It is astounding ( at least to me ) the intrigue and corruption ( from everywhere ) that goes on in these deals .
Musharraf granted Bhutto , her husband , associated politicians and bureaucrats involved in this vast money - laundering ( theft from Pakistan ) a full Presidential pardon ( amnesty ) which would ' unlock ' the countless millions they have stashed in various accounts as determined by investigations done by numerous countries .
You KNOW he did n't grant the pardons without a GREEN light from the BIG BOYS ( global ) .
I can see how this might have been an incentive for Ms. Bhutto to return to Pakistan .
Who killed her ?
Hmmm - the extreme element of Muslims in this country did n't want her ( ugh , a woman - lap dog to Washington ) - Musharref , maybe , but he 's enjoying his singular power too much , or maybe she needed killed , to get the people to turn against Musharref .
In any event - she was STUPID for listening to Washington - and stupid for stealing from the Pakistani people .
And the poor of Pakistan - as in any land - why they were looking for a secular savior ( but she was n't it ) .
Just like our election theater here ... how sad .
A person buying a $ 175,000 necklace and gated mansions and estates - living in obscene luxury , is NOT a savior to the poor ... sorry .
Meantime , our wag the dog goes on .

IF you take the time to read this you 'll be pissed off at ( or should be ) how superficial and contrived the infotainment you 're ( we 're ) being fed , 24/7/365 .
PS , the MidEast and Europe are n't being given the Enquirer PR crap that we 're getting .
You have to figure if Washington was pinning their hopes on Bhutto - the whole scheme is rotten to the core .
Ms. Bhutto was NO Gandhi .

ATLANTA — For 25 years , they have been talking about the weather nonstop .
At The Weather Channel , which has its headquarters here , that talk once amounted to a reliable humdrum of forecasts and storm coverage in the United States and abroad .
In addition to broadcasting weather reports , the channel has thrived by selling its utilitarian but appealing content to newspapers , radio stations and Web sites , and by developing specialty programs around everyone ’s favorite elevator - ride conversation topic .
“ The weather is not controversial , but people are very engaged with it , ” Debora J. Wilson , the president of the network , said in a recent interview in her office .
The daily weather forecast is rarely controversial , but the broader topic of climate change has generated no end of debate .
As the network has seen its primary subject turn into a hot - button issue , it has had to grapple with how it wants to address it — and has decided not to tread gingerly .

Guess which one C&L agrees with ?
First up on Billo's ' attack the far - left list ' Monday night was the Seattle Post Intelligencer .
See , back in Aug the FBI asked the Seattle media to run a photo of two men who looked " like they could be Middle Eastern .
Or Latino .
Or Italian .
Or any of several other nationalities / ethnicities " that the Feds said had " been seen on several ferries and seemed " overly interested in the workings and layout . " "
So only after thoughtfully weighing the need for ferry security against the men's civil liberties and privacy the SPI editor chose to run " a story about the FBI 's alert , " but he chose not to publish the photographs , and Billo 's been attacking him repeatedly on his show ever since .
So last week when one of the Seattle PI columnists wrote that she could understand how a disturbed young man could see " the church as an oppressive institution " Billo really got his loofah in a bunch , and just like he has done so many times before , he sent his flunkies out to ambush the editor at his home to ask him about it .
Unfortunately the SPI editor must not really be from the " far left " or else surely he would have known KO 's 3 magic words to use should anyone ever find O'Reilly 's goons in their face with a camera : Malmedy , Mackris , and loofah .
Apparently the ambush was n't enough to satisfy Billo , so he then set his sights on Mark Cuban for financing the new movie " Redacted " for its depiction of atrocities committed by some of our soldiers in Iraq , and Cuban had a few choice words to say about it .
Note to Billo , this film is not going to incite any more anti-American hatred than the actual criminal actions of a few bad soldiers already did , and nothing could be more anti-American than pretending to report the news and acting like that never happened , and attacking those who wo n't .
Sweeping the horrors of war under the rug is not the supporting the troops .
A public that better understands those horrors is what a democracy needs so that it never unnecessarily sends our soldiers into war in the first place .
When Sociologist Rene Almeling decided to look into the operations of U.S. sperm banks and egg agencies , the UCLA Ph.D. candidate in sociology thought she knew what she would find .
She figured that any discrepancies in compensation rates for the building blocks of assisted reproduction could be explained by either market forces or the biological differences between female egg donors , who must undergo hormone therapy and outpatient surgery , and their male counterparts , who , as one recruitment ad put it , “ get paid to do what you already do . ”
Instead , Almeling , whose findings appear in the June issue of the American Sociological Review , uncovered a topsy - turvy market that often defies not just conventional wisdom but also the basic law of supply and demand .
“ Men donors are paid less for a much longer time commitment and a great deal of personal inconvenience , ” she said .
“ They also are much less prepared for the emotional consequences of serving as a donor of reproductive material .
Women , meanwhile , are not only paid more for a much shorter time commitment , they are repeatedly thanked for ‘ giving the gift of life . ’
“ From compensation rates to the smallest details of donor relations , sperm donors are less valued than egg donors , ” Almeling said .
“ Egg donors are treated like gold , while sperm donors are perceived as a dime a dozen . ”
The inequities persist despite the fact that profiles of hundreds of potential egg donors languish on agency Web sites , far outstripping recipient demand , while suitable sperm donors are quite rare , Almeling found .
In fact , only a tiny fraction of the male population possesses a sperm count consistently high enough to be considered donation - worthy , and more than 90 percent of sperm bank applicants are rejected for this and other reasons .
As a result , sperm banks routinely resort to finder ’s fees to meet the need .
advertisement
“ A pronounced double - standard exists in the way that men and women donors are valued by the fertility industry , and it ca n’t be explained medically or by market forces , ” Almeling said .
“ Based on the availability of donors alone , you would expect the abundance of potential egg donors to drive down compensation fees and the scarcity of potential sperm donors to drive up their fees .
But I found just the opposite .
Almeling ’s findings are part of a growing body of research on the sociology of markets in life - saving and life - giving material , including blood and organ donations and life insurance payouts .
But Almeling ’s study , which is based on interviews with 25 staff members at two sperm banks and two egg agencies , is believed to be the first detailed comparison of gender - based differences in U.S. compensation rates for reproductive material .
Almeling has been gathering data on the medical market in genetic material for the past five years .
Almeling found that it is not unusual for egg donors in large cities to make upwards of $ 5,000 per donation — no matter the outcome .
Agencies also encourage recipient couples to provide female donors with thank - you notes , small tokens of appreciation and even cash bonuses .
In contrast , sperm banks do not pay as well or encourage such displays of gratitude .
Male donors make between $ 50 and $ 75 per donation , and they are paid only when their samples meet the high fertility standards required for freezing .
Over the length of their contracts — generally , an entire year — sperm donors may make as much as their female counterparts do over the course of a single six - week cycle , but only if they donate more than the required one sample per week .
Invariably , however , earnings of sperm donors fell short , either because donors missed weekly sessions or their samples failed to meet fertility standards .
Women also may donate as many as three times in a year , and their fees increase with each completed cycle .
So an egg donor actually stands to make far more during the same period of time than even the most diligent and fertile sperm donor .
Moreover , men work much longer for their pay than women , and their activities are much more restricted as a result .
In addition to requiring weekly donations for a year , sperm banks instruct men to refrain from sex for two days prior to donation or risk the possibility that their samples will fail to meet fertility standards .
Being sick or stressed also has a negative effect on sperm count .

“ Even the doctors who were working with infertile couples were surprised when they learned just how demanding the process is for men , ” Almeling said .
“ Sperm donors basically have to schedule their sex lives for a year . ”
Meanwhile , their female counterparts also have to refrain from sex , but their activities are restricted only for six weeks .
However , the women have to commit to a degree of bodily invasiveness not experienced by men : a six - week regime of hormone therapy , which leads to serious complications in 1 to 2 percent of cases , and a single egg - extraction procedure that causes some discomfort and leads to serious complications in less than 1 out of 1,000 cases , according to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine .
Men and women were n’t just compensated dramatically differently .
They also experienced dramatically different “ working ” conditions .
Almeling found that women were repeatedly reminded of their generosity , whereas men tended to be reminded that sperm donation was to be viewed like any other job .
“ Staff at egg agencies constantly thank women and encourage them to think about what a wonderful difference they ’re making in the lives of recipients , ” Almeling said .
“ The sperm bank staff is appreciative , but men are n’t told how amazing they are and what a great gift they ’re giving .
They ’re treated more like reproductive service workers .
They come in .
They clock in and out .
Their sample is checked for quality .
And they ’re only paid when they produce an acceptable sample . ”
The medical community has justified compensation rates for egg donors by pointing out that egg extraction is more difficult and risky than extracting sperm and that the female body has a limited supply of eggs , while the male body replenishes sperm .
But Almeling does not believe these biological differences fully explain this market .
While an individual woman has fewer eggs than an individual man has sperm , women never run the risk of “ running out ” of eggs due to donating .
Moreover , the huge oversupply of women willing to be donors means that eggs are not actually scarce for couples seeing to acquire them .
Cultural norms of parenthood , which are perpetuated though marketing efforts , interact with these biological understandings to produce the differences in market prices , Almeling believes .
“ Both eggs and egg donors are more highly valued than sperm and sperm donors , where it is not just reproductive material but visions of middle - class , American femininity and masculinity and motherhood and fatherhood that are marketed and purchased , ” she said .
Donor recruitment at the egg agencies and sperm banks appeared to reinforce these stereotypes , Almeling found .
Egg agency advertisements tend to appeal to women ’s altruism , while men are informed of a job opportunity .
The application process for donors also favors what Almeling called “ gendered stereotypes of selfless motherhood and distant fatherhood . ”
Although egg donors stood to be handsomely compensated , women who indicated there was a financial motive behind their participation were routinely rejected in favor of applicants who expressed more altruistic motives , such as the desire to “ help ” infertile couples .
Sperm banks , meanwhile , were much less explicit about the need to appear altruistic .
“ While most egg donors will never meet their genetic children , women are expected to reproduce well - worn patters of ‘ naturally ’ caring , helpful femininity , guiltily hiding any interest that they might have in the promise of thousands of dollars , ” Almeling said .
“ This ruse is not demanded of sperm donors .
Men , who are more likely to be contacted through the banks ’ identity release programs , often do not even consider that children will result from regular deposits at the sperm bank . ”
In fact , one sperm donor was dumbstruck when he was informed that one of his contributions had resulted in conception .
“ I had n’t really thought about the fact there were going to be pregnancies , ” he said .

In March of 2005 , Google acquired Urchin Software Corporation , a San Diego - based web analytics company .
A few short months later , Google Analytics was unveiled , which was based on " Urchin On Demand , " Urchin 's javascript - based " Software as a Service " ( SaaS ) web traffic analytics solution .
Urchin customers were generally thrilled about the acquisition , because it was assumed that it meant great things were in store for all of Urchin 's customers .
In reality , Urchin 's core customers have been ignored , product development has stopped on everything but Google Analytics , and companies are wondering why Google took the money and , well , ran .
The problem stems from the apparent fact that Google 's interest in Urchin Software Corporation was limited to its SaaS offering .
Google has since developed Urchin On Demand into a real powerhouse analytics suite , and given its ease - of - use and cost ( " free " ) , it 's amazingly popular .
The problem is that Urchin 's other analytic tools have been ignored since the acquisition took place , but they were n't supposed to be .
Urchin's most popular analytics software was a server - based log analysis suite known simply as " Urchin . "
Urchin 5 came in a variety of flavors , priced according to tiers .
It could be had for as little as $ 900 , or you could easily pay more than $ 10,000 , depending on the features and support you needed .
Urchin's log - based analysis gave webmasters access to data that is not available to javascript - based solutions ( particularly : info for / on non-javascript clients , server - side application errors , custom user tracking , and more ) .
Many customers would much rather have Urchin updated than turn to Google Analytics .
Yet Urchin is still sitting at version 5.7 , even though version 6 was in testing in late 2004 , just before the Google acquisition .
In the wake of Google 's purchase of the company , inquiring customers ( including Ars Technica ) were told that support and updates would continue .
Companies that had purchased support contracts were expecting version 6 any day , including Ars .
What really happened is this : Google focused its attention on Google Analytics , put all updates to Urchin 's other products on the back burner , and rolled out a skeleton support team .
Everyone who forked over for upgrades via a support contract never got them , even though things were n't supposed to have changed .
The support experience has been awful .
Since the acquisition , we have had two major issues with Urchin , and neither issue was solved by Google 's support team .
In fact , with one issue , we were helped up until the point it got difficult , and then the help vanished .
The support team literally just stopped responding .
As InfoWorld points out in a report on the situation , Google wo n't comment on if or when an update is coming .
The report cites customers who are worried that this means Urchin may be " discontinued . "
Here 's a news flash : when it takes 2.5 years to get an upgrade out that was due shortly after the Red Sox won the 2004 World Series , it 's already effectively " discontinued . "
Many companies desperately want to believe that Google still takes Urchin seriously , however .
I suppose when you pay more than $ 10,000 for software and support contracts , it 's painful to watch a third party walk right in and destroy the value of that software purchase by failing to provide meaningful support and turning its attention elsewhere .
" Them 's the breaks , " as they say : the support contracts never guaranteed upgrades .
Of course , after buying the company , Google is free to do with it as they see fit .
It 's a shame , however , because Urchin 's tools were indeed some of the best , and Google Analytics is not a drop - in replacement .
We 've long since given up hope of ever seeing 6.0 , but given the fact that Google still offers a trial and still directs people to resellers for 5.7 , perhaps we should n't give up hope just yet .
This is what you see if you go to www.google.com right now and you live in San Francisco .
I guess they ’re doing geolocation specific homepages now .
Yikes !
Google ’s trying to raise awareness for solar power !
Alright , alright , not JUST solar power .
Here is where Google ’s “ lights out ” link goes .
My friend in IM in response to this said : “ Hey , did you know some dude figured out that if Google made their page black that it would save like 300000 gillion megawatts or something ? ”
Well , actually BS .
Google outed that guy as wrong , apparently it takes more juice to run a black screen than a white screen .
I believe this because it came from google and , well , of all people , they would know the answer to THAT question ….
but I ’m an electrical engineer and I ’m not sure why .
LEE Iacocca is no fan of President Bush .
“ I campaigned for him because I knew his mother and dad for 30 years , and I figured he was from pretty good stock , ” the auto - industry legend tells Details magazine .
“ But Jeb was being groomed , too .
They got the wrong kid .
There ’s something wrong philosophi- cally with how Bush ’s brain works .
I feel sorry for him .
I used to think [ Al ]
Gore was nuts in his worrying about global warming , but he was ahead of his time . ”

Former CIA officer : US to attack Iran within 6 months David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday August 21 , 2007
Print This Email This Fox News asked former CIA field officer Bob Baer on Tuesday whether the US is " gearing up for a military strike on Iran . "
Baer has written a column for Time indicating that Washington officials expect an attack within the next six months .
" I 've taken an informal poll inside the government , " Baer told Fox .
" The feeling is we will hit the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps . "
His
Time column also suggested that " as long as we have bombers and missiles in the air , we will hit Iran 's nuclear facilities . "
Baer explained that what his sources anticipate is " not exactly a war . "
He said the administration is convinced " that the Iranians are interfering in Iraq and the rest of the Gulf " but that " if there is an attack on Iran it would be very quick , it would be a warning . "
" We wo n't see American troops cross the border .
...
If this is going to happen , it 's going to happen very quickly and it's going to surprise a lot of people , " said Baer .
" I hope I 'm wrong frankly , but we 're going to see . "
The following video is from Fox 's America 's Newsroom , broadcast on August 21 .
DIGG THIS
I returned at the end of last week from the Imperial fall maneuvers , held this year in Ostland .
His Majesty ’s forces prevailed , for much the same reasons that Blue usually wins in American war games .
As someone who has led Red to victory in several senior - level games conducted in Washington , I can assure you that is n’t supposed to happen .
I do n’t think it possible for any historian to visit the Baltic countries or the rest of Central Europe and not reflect on the catastrophes World War I brought for that part of the world .
Communism , World War II , National Socialism , the extinction of some communities and the expulsion of others , wholesale alteration of national boundaries , all these and more flowed from the assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand on June 28 , 1914 .
One pebble touched off an avalanche .
It did so because it occurred , not as an isolated incident , but as one more in a series of crises that rocked Europe in its last ten years of peace , 1904 — 1914 .
Each of those crises had the potential to touch off a general European war , and each further de-stabilized the region , making the next incident all the more dangerous .
1905 —06 witnessed the First Moroccan Crisis , when the German Foreign Office ( whose motto , after Bismarck , might well be , " Clowns unto ages of ages " ) compelled a very reluctant Kaiser Wilhelm II to land at Tangier as a challenge to France .
1908 brought the Bosnian Annexation Crisis , where Austria humiliated Russia and left her anxious for revenge .
Then came the Second Moroccan Crisis of 1911 , the Tripolitan War of 1911 — 1912 ( a war Italy actually won , against the tottering Ottoman Empire ) and the Balkan Wars of 1912 — 13 .
By 1914 , it had become a question more of which crisis would finally set all Europe ablaze than of whether peace would endure .
This was true despite the fact that , in the abstract , no major European state wanted war .
If this downward spiral of events in Europe reminds us of the Middle East today , it should .
There too we see a series of crises , each holding the potential of kicking off a much larger war .
There are almost too many to list : the war in Iraq , the U.S versus Iran , Israel vs. Syria , the U.S. vs. Syria , Syria vs. Lebanon , Turkey vs. Kurdistan , the war in Afghanistan , the de-stabilization of Pakistan , Hamas , Hezbollah , al Qaeda , and the permanent crisis of Israel vs. the Palestinians .
Each is a tick of the bomb , bringing us closer and closer to the explosion no one wants , no one outside the neo-con cabal and Likud , anyway .
A basic rule of history is that the inevitable eventually happens .
If you keep on smoking in the powder magazine , you will at some point blow it up .
No one can predict the specific event or its timing , but everyone can see the trend and where it is leading .
In the Middle East today , as in Europe in the decade before World War I , the desperate need is for a country or a leader to reverse the trend .
Then , the two European leaders most opposed to war , Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany and Tsar Nicholas II of Russia , were able to do little more than drag their feet , trying to slow the train of events down .
That was not enough , and it will not be enough today in the Middle East either .
Where do we see a leader who can turn aside the march toward war ?
Not in the Middle East itself , nor among American Presidential candidates , only two of whom , Ron Paul and Dennis Kucinich , represent a real change of direction .
Not in Europe , whose heads of government are terrified of breaking with the Americans .
Not in Moscow or Beijing , both of which are happy to see America digging its own grave .
No matter where we look , the horizon is empty .
Where vision is wanting , the people perish .
As they did in Central Europe in the 20th century , by the tens of millions .

Why I'm Returning My Amazon Kindle
The device itself works fine .
Yes , the screen could be more readable and it's awkward to handle because the previous - and next - page buttons are much too big .
( You can't grab the device by its edges . )
I finished reading my first book on the Kindle yesterday ( The Kite Runner ) , and the experience was fine .
I really like the ability to preview any book by reading the first three chapters .
Web access is clumsy because most web sites expect a much wider screen and clicking on links is roundabout and flakey , but it does work , it 's very fast , and it does n't depend on WiFi .
Buying even best sellers for $ 10 or less is a great deal , as is the free web access .
But the problem is that the books are incomplete .
I started the sample of my second book , Under the Banner of Heaven , and I noticed that the footnotes , marked with an asterisk in the text , were missing .
( You 're supposed to be able to select them as hyperlinks , but they were n't connected to anything . )
I checked another book I had in paper form , Einstein : His Life and Universe , and the only footnote that I could find in the sample seemed to be linked , although I could n't actually access it since it was n't part of the sample .
Fair enough .
But The Path Between the Seas failed .
A footnote was marked with an asterisk , but not linked .
I queried Amazon 's very responsive Customer Service , and they responded ( on a Sunday ! ) with this : " Kindle Editions are electronic versions based on the original publication issued by the publishers .
Occasionally , conversion of that content for reading on Kindle may require modification of content , layout , or format , including the omission of some images and tables and in this case footnotes . "
Well , I do n't want to read Kindle Editions , whatever they are .
I want to read the books as written .
I might be able to tolerate the situation if the abridged books were so marked in the store , but they are n't .
I 'm also disturbed by Amazon 's claim that they have 90,000 + ( or whatever ) books available , which simply is n't true .
Amazon is very good about returning Kindles ( or anything else ) .
They even supply a UPS label that you can print , so all I have to do is drop the box off at the UPS counter at my local Staples store .
No hard feelings against Amazon , who is still my favorite retailer .
It 's a shame that the Kindle is done in by sloppy preparation and misleading descriptions of the books .
Maybe that will change someday , but , until it does , I 'll insist on the books I read being complete .

Nigeria analyst
Nigeria 's government is suing three international tobacco firms for $ 44bn ( £ 22 bn ) - the first such case in the developing world - due to start in the capital , Abuja .
Smoking at a young age is a problem across Africa
British American Tobacco ( BAT ) , Philip Morris and International Tobacco Ltd , deny the claims and say they are socially responsible companies who do not target children .
They question the massive sums demanded by the government and say the case " has no merit " .
But government lawyers are convinced they have a strong case .
E-mails between tobacco firm employees to be shown to the court in the capital Abuja will reveal deliberate attempts to increase the number of " young and underage " smokers and attempts to influence lawmakers to keep tobacco sales unregulated , they say .
Documents we have refer to ways of increasing the number of ' YAUS ' [ Young And Underage Smokers ] in Nigeria
Babatunde Irukera
Government lawyer
Nigeria seeks $ 40 bn over smoking
Four Nigerian state governments also plan to go to court early in 2008 to argue similar cases .
Cigarette smoking is widespread in Nigeria and BAT recently set up a factory in the West African country .
Campaigners in Nigeria say children are sent positive messages about smoking all the time .
And young people across Nigeria can buy cigarettes from vendors in single " sticks " , which campaigners say makes it easier for young people to pick up the habit .
The World Health Organization estimates that 18 % of young Nigerians smoke - storing up huge potential health problems in a country of 140 million people , most of whom are under 20 .
Dossier
" If this case gets to the evidence stage , the companies are dead on arrival , " says Babatunde Irukera , prosecuting the case for the government .
" We expect they will try to delay the case by questioning the jurisdiction of the court .
But if they see that they 're in trouble we expect them to try and settle out of court . "
We have n't got a clue where the government got the amount they are asking for
Catherine Armstrong , BAT
" Documents we have refer to ways of increasing the number of ' YAUS ' in Nigeria .
We have expert testimony that says YAUS means ' Young And Underage Smokers ' , " he said .
The e-mails come from a public depository of evidence uncovered during a series of class - action lawsuits across the US .
Many of those cases have been initially successful , but litigants have seen payouts slashed or kicked out on appeal .
In 2000 a Florida court awarded $ 145 bn damages to hundreds of thousands of smokers , but the case was thrown out on appeal .
The Florida supreme court said making such an award would " result in an unlawful crippling of the defendant companies " .
Poor hospitals
Nigerian public hospitals are chaotic , poorly funded places where equipment is often out of date or broken .
Corruption and inefficiency are also responsible for the overload on the health service .
Tobacco company lawyers may argue there is little evidence that the government has been taking responsibility for its own health services .
" We have n't got a clue where the government got the amount they are asking for .
Much of what they claim does n't add up , " said British American Tobacco spokesperson in London Catherine Armstrong .
The company says they have been operating in Nigeria since the early 1900s and has never targeted children .
" It is false to suggest that tobacco companies have had a knee - jerk reaction to falling markets elsewhere in the world , " Ms Armstrong said .
The tobacco firms expect legal arguments to go on for " years and years " , she added .
Counter - productive
But anti-smoking campaigners say children are definitely the targets of marketing campaigns .
Cigarette companies sponsor fashion shows and music concerts , said Eze Eluchie of People Against Drug Dependence and Ignorance ( Paddi ) , a Lagos - based organisation .
" They have something called an 18 - plus programme , which they say tries to prevent young people from taking up smoking .
But when 16 - and 17 - year - olds see that , it makes them think smoking is grown - up .
It 's counter - productive , " he said .
Whatever happens with the court case , the government is already trying to curb the spread of smoking .
Cigarette adverts have been restricted - only allowed on radio and TV after 2200 and billboards have been scrapped .
The authorities in the capital , Abuja , are also considering a smoking ban in public places .
It ’s hard enough to give up part of Thanksgiving and camp in a cold parking lot to get a great deal .
But some Best Buy employees allegedly made the experience absolutely miserable by passing over some customers and playing favorites .
One family waited in line for 14 hours and did n’t get the computer they wanted and watched as a Best Buy employee smuggled a voucher for the same laptop to his girlfriend .
One of the most sought - after Black Friday laptops was the Toshiba A135 - S7403 , for $ 229 .
Each Best
Buy store had at least 15 in stock , along with dozens of other Black Friday laptops .
To maintain a sense of order , Best Buy managers were supposed to hand out vouchers on a first - come , first - serve basis .
But according to one of our readers , the Best Buy managers at the Elmwood Shopping Center Best Buy in New Orleans passed out a handful of vouchers , despite having dozens of notebooks in stock .
Brandi shared her family ’s Black Friday ordeal in the below email .
She ended up getting a laptop ( but not the one she wanted ) , while her sister and father waited in line for nothing .
If everything she says is accurate , I think the employees responsible for holding back laptops should be fired and Best Buy should do something for Brandi ’s family .
Brandi ’s email :
My sister , dad , and myself get in the Best Buy line at 3:00 PM Thursday afternoon .
We had no problems in the line besides being cold and tired .
Everyone else in line was really nice and we were doing pretty good , until the vouchers came out .
We were # 28 , 29 , and 30 in line .
When the Toshiba and Sony vouchers came out there were none left by the time they got to us .
We were like WHAT ?!
Everyone in front of us was n’t getting laptops .
The desktop vouchers were even gone .
I managed to get the last HP laptop voucher , but my dad and sister were n’t so lucky .
So , my dad asked one of the passing Best Buy workers what happened to all the vouchers .
She told us that there was only 2 Toshiba bundles , 5 Sony notebooks , 3 Sony bundles , 7 HP laptops and 3 HP bundles .
The ad said there were supposed to be 15 of each per store .
We knew she was lying because one of Best Buy ’s employees that was waiting in line with his girlfriend told us that this is the store he works at and they got 15 of each computer except the Toshiba bundle , there was 20 of those .
What set our blood to boil was what happened next .
The girl with the boyfriend who works there did n’t get a voucher .
She was about 7 spots behind us in line and she was nÃ ƒ Æ ’ Ã‚ ¢Ãƒ ¢Ã¢â‚ ¬Å¡Ã‚ ¬Ãƒ ¢Ã¢â‚ ¬Å¾Ã‚¢t going to get anything she came there for .
She started throwing a fit outside , crying and yelling .
Well , her boyfriend comes walking outside with something under his shirt .
He pulls out the voucher , hands it to her then walks away .
She opens it and is as quiet as can be .
My dad says that he thinks that boy snuck her out a computer voucher .
He walks over to her and asks her did she finally get a computer .
She tells him that her boyfriend brought her out a Toshiba bundle voucher .
Only 2 vouchers Best Buy ?
Yeah right !!!
When we went in the store , there were loads of those $ 229 Toshiba ’s locked in a case , along with Sonys and HPs .
Once we got our computer we noticed a flyer saying $ 100 off any computer purchase instantly if you sign up for high speed Internet service .
I said pretty good deal since its instant .
I went to one of the workers to ask him about it , he called another guy over and told him to help us .
That guy said he did n’t know how to do it and the original guy we asked told him there was a walk through on the computer .
So we followed him to the computer and he is struggling trying to figure out how to work it .
He tells us that he is n’t a sales associate but only works the cash register .
So we get this guy who has absolutely no idea what he ’s doing .
Then he tells us the computer system is down .
I do n’t believe it was down , I just think he did n’t know how to do it and did n’t want to be bothered .
How in the world could your computer system be down on the busiest shopping day of the year , the day when you need your computers the most ?
So we went to the store manager to ask him to help us w/ it and he tells us he ’s too busy to go to customer service .
I said forget it , I just want to buy my computer and get the hell out of there .
Here ’s where the fun really begins .
We are at the checkout counter and the girl is ringing us up .
She tells me the total then I remember that I ’m a rewards member but I do n’t have my card .
She says ok and to swipe my card .
I swipe it then ask her if she credited my points , she replies “ NO ! ” .
I ask her how am I supposed to get my points credited , she says “ I do n’t know . ”
The only reason I am making such a big fuss is because I just signed up for it and I can get double points if I spent a certain amount over holiday shopping .
So , she calls the manager over and the manager tells her to void out the transaction and credit my points .
I ’m told to swipe my card again .
I say “ Wait , was the money already taken from my account ? ” .
The manager says yes but since they voided that transaction the money should be released within 1 - 3 business days .
Which means instead of me paying $ 489.12 I ’m paying $ 978.24 until my credit card company decides to release half of it .
I tell her that now I ca n’t do any more shopping because Best Buy is getting all my money .
That manager gets annoyed and walks off .
The girl at the register calls another manager and explains the situation to her .
She tells me I have one of 2 options : swipe my card again , or leave the computer with them until I call my credit card company and straighten it out .
I said that I have been waiting in line for 14 hours for this computer and there was no way I was leaving it because who ’s to say that when I come back it ’ll still be there , and I am not swiping my card again because I am paying close to $ 1000 and wo n’t be able to do any other shopping .
My dad says that their corporate office will hear about this , the manager says “ Great , tell ’em , my name is Lisa , see it on my shirt . ”
She then calls ANOTHER manager over and starts telling me the same thing .
I just start breaking out in tears and telling him that I ’m being penalized for something that is n’t even my fault ; it was the cashier who did n’t know what she was doing .
I ’m crying so bad right now that he begins to feel bad and tells me he ’s going to call my credit card company and get it taken care of .
He get all my information , comes back in about 15 minutes , and tells me that they just released the original $ 489.12 and I can swipe my card again .
Why could n’t the 1st manager just do this for me , it took for me to break down and cry to get them to help me ?
Finally , we get home and its after 8:30 Ã ƒÆ ’Ã‚¢Ãƒ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚¬Ãƒ¢Ã¢â€š¬Ã … we live 10 minutes from the store .
We were inside that store for over 3 hours .
My whole day was ruined .
I did n’t even want to go out shopping anymore .
My dad gets on the phone with corporate and explains what happened to them .
The rep didnÃ ƒ Æ ’Ã‚ ¢Ãƒ ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚¬Ãƒ¢Ã¢â‚ ¬Å¾Ã‚¢t believe him .
My dad asks to speak to a supervisor .
The supervisor tells my dad that what he is telling him is “ hear say ” and ca n’t verify anything my dad is telling him to be true .
He was even asking my dad to tell him the color of the voucher that was given to the girlfriend and the color of the words written on it .
After nothing but back and forth between them , he finally realizes what my dad is telling him is true ; either that or he just wants my dad off the phone .
This is my first real Black Friday shopping experience and waiting in that line was more enjoyable than actually getting in that store and buying what I wanted .
This had to be my worst ordeal I ’ve ever had to endure in a store , EVER !
The computer I bought was n’t even the computer I waited in line to buy .
I came for the Toshiba bundle for $ 229 , but after only handing out 2 vouchers for those , they magically were “ out ” .
I ended up getting the very last voucher for their supply of computers .
I bought the HP - Pavilion dv6607nr for $ 449 ; $ 489.12 after tax .
There was a $ 200 instant rebate .
This happened at the Best Buy in New Orleans , LA at the Elmood Shopping Center location .
Exclusive to STR
No one except perhaps cave - dwellers can fully ignore the atrocious elements of fascism in America ( not to mention communism ) .
Clips on YouTube and other websites document rights - violations committed by government 's employees on a daily basis .
Fortunately , in concert with the growing grass - roots of liberty - lovers who comprise the " Ron Paul rEVOLution , " some are directly challenging and educating us about ongoing statist aggressions .
Governmental power grabs in the name of " security " have become commonplace .
Bad ideas about the nature of government give rise to such actions .
Bad ideas essentially foster a society that tolerates tyranny .
Rationalizing bad ideas and bad behavior is the oldest game in the book of governmental power .
The trick is to convince people that certain things are n't bad for them , but are rather for their own good ' especially when it comes to the safety of their community or " homeland . "
Whether or not people are fully convinced by the relentless propaganda in these matters , real or ideological goose - stepping typically follows .
Wikipedia has an interesting quotation by George Orwell about goose - stepping :
[ Goose - Stepping ] is simply an affirmation of naked power ; contained in it , quite consciously and intentionally , is the vision of a boot crashing down on a face .
Its ugliness is part of its essence , for what it is saying is ' Yes , I am ugly , and you dare n't laugh at me ' , like the bully who makes faces at his victim . . . .
Beyond a certain point , military display is only possible in countries where the common people dare not laugh at the army .
Goose - stepping is of course best done with the right frame of mind .
First , one must empty it of logical thought .
Then , one must march , literally or ideologically , to whatever fuels one 's emotions .
Needless to say , a terrorist attack on American soil can serve as a potent marching fuel .
What better way to demonstrate that " Islamofascists " are hell bent on destruction of our lives and property than a band of them killing approximately 3,000 Americans on 9/11/2001 ?
With this in mind , the intellectuals at the Ayn Rand Institute ( ARI ) desire to take us to the land of rationality , freedom , peace , prosperity , and respect for individual rights .
However , in order to do this , they apparently believe it 's necessary to compromise some principles .
Namely , we must use the tools of the State to conquer our enemies , those radical mystics who hate us , the fellows at ARI allege , solely because of our freedoms ( stemming from our enlightened Western worldview ) .
" We " must wage war on " them " in an unrelenting fashion , disregarding any collateral damage ( e.g. , civilian casualties ) , because " we " are moral and " they " are evil .
This is no laughing matter , after all .
The " we " here is used ( wittingly or not ) to conflate all Americans with the actions of the U.S. government , its military , and its more clandestine and even more unaccountable coercive organizations such as the CIA , NSA , DHS , ICE , FBI , etc .
The ARI fellows believe that the U.S. government should n't appease other countries by apologizing for its assertions of power in the Middle East ; it should n't make concessions ; it should n't be diplomatic ; it should n't lose face ; and , it should n't cut and run .
They also believe that even though " we " should n't be in Iraq , " we " should fight to " win , " nevertheless .
Additionally , the U.S. government should n't be " selfless " by trying to institute freedom or democracy or stability in the Middle East ( in contrast to what warmonger - for - freedom Dinesh D'Souza advocated at Freedom Fest 2007 in Las Vegas ) .
Nope , the fellows at ARI see such policies as self - sacrificial .
Rather , " we " must destroy the enemies of reason , egoism , and individualism who threaten us until they 're all wiped off the planet , or until they so tremble in fear at the mere mention of " America " that they would n't even think about being aggressive .
( Curiously , war - mongering intellectuals seldom practice exactly what they preach .
Given what they 've helped sow and reap lately , it 's little surprise that being air - dropped into Baghdad to do patrol for a year is n't on their things - to - do - for - liberty list . )
These are the ideas I heard during ARI 's public lecture at the Hilton in Costa Mesa , CA on the sixth anniversary of 9/11 .
Instead of rational arguments , I heard arguments for preemptive strikes and collective punishment of entire countries of people .
ARI member Elan Journo began his speech , titled " The Road to 9/11 : How America 's Selfless Policies Unleashed the Jihadists , " by setting the historical context of terrorism .
Where did he start ?
In 1979 with the taking of the hostages in Tehran , Iran .
He then proceeded to catalog the various terrorist attacks since then on military personnel and civilians .
The idea of foreign policy blowback was conspicuously absent from his talk .
While the fellows at ARI declare U.S. military actions overseas to be misguided , apparently they also believe that no one abroad ought to complain about them , let alone violently resist them , because they 're mostly done to " help " others , i.e. , for supposed altruistic purposes .
Similarly , not a disparaging word was uttered by Journo about the Israeli government 's rights - violating actions over the years ( apparently people in Palestine are always to blame ) .
Further , he offered no discussion of or critical reflection on the past operations of the CIA in Iran , let alone elsewhere , and no acknowledgment of his audience members ' ( and Middle Easterners ' ) capacity to recall such things .
It seems that in ARI 's world , neither the government of Israel nor the government of the United States plays an indictable role in the increase in terrorism and Middle Eastern conflicts ( other than the two governments ' militarily weak , or " selfless , " policies of course ) .
Another sizable tidbit Journo left out was the fact that terrorism mainly began in Sri Lanka , courtesy of the Tamil Tigers , which a statist - oriented source reiterates .
Just as troubling was how much Journo appealed to emotions throughout his speech , seemingly encouraging audience members to quench their thirst with a toxic brand of jingoistic Kool - Aid .
According to views expressed by Journo and Yaron Brook ( ARI 's director ) in the Q&A , every American supposedly has an Islamofascist 's gun to their head , and the practical response is to use the U.S. government 's tax - and - Federal Reserve Bank - funded military to destroy those who threaten " America . "
This of course translates into anyone who currently threatens the U.S. government 's foreign escapades and related corporate interests .
In response to my question , both Brook and Journo asserted that the end ( our safety ) justifies a rights - violating means ( U.S. governmental actions ) .
In other words , the ARI fellows apparently believe that the practical and the moral need not be aligned when our lives and safety are at stake ' which openly flouts Ayn Rand 's cogent expositions about the moral being the practical and vice versa .
This must be done in order to achieve security for Americans .
Even though the ARI fellows , if pressed , would contend that their ideal form of government must be voluntarily funded ( Rand 's version of laissez - faire capitalism ) , such a government supposedly is n't practical for their policies at this juncture .
Dying To Win : The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism is one of the many things the ARI scholars should have put on their homework list ( as well as this and this ) before they attempted to give any sort of history lesson on terrorism .
As mentioned , because they believe that terrorists are motivated by no political grievances , but rather by their sheer lust to impose Sharia or death upon all of us , how could the fellows at ARI ever analyze the facts and be objective ?
By trying to meld an ethics of rational self - interest ( egoism ) and psychology of self - esteem ( self - confidence and self - respect ) with the premises of collectivism and statism , they 've clearly rendered their particular Taggart Transcontinental locomotive unfit for traveling on a logical track Rearden metal .
Yet Rearden metal has substantive problems too .
The political branch of Objectivism , as Ayn Rand devised it , entertains a sizable contradiction .
It holds that a monopolistic organization of people called government is necessary to protect everyone within its coercively and arbitrarily imposed boundaries .
Therefore , in Objectivism , government is viewed as an institution that is , or at least can or should be , efficacious ' despite all evidence and logic to the contrary .
While Objectivism 's ethical branch extols a moral code based on rational self - interest , individualism , and happiness according to objective values and virtues , its political branch harbors the ideas of collectivism and statism .
Thus , we witness attempts by ARI 's fellows and their supporters to justify actions of people in government by appealing to absurd abstractions such as national " self - interest . "
Instead of noticing their essential conflict in these matters , they continue to sanction and promote the coercive behavior of those working for the State ' and thereby drop the context of self - interest , individualism , and happiness , in addition to reason and objective reality .
Instead of strictly denouncing taxation and the welfare / warfare State , and by extension its ridiculous military structure , based on Objectivism 's principles of reason and individualism ' and individualism 's historical and societal roots in America ' the fellows at ARI utilize the currently hegemonic , neoconned political climate and the psychological aftermath of 9/11 in a way that rivals the mainstream media ( some of the corporate heads of which are conveniently on the boards of various defense contractors ) .
Truthiness has replaced logic to understand war and the elements of statism and collectivism that give rise to it .
We 're now in mortal danger , they implore , and government 's responsibility is to protect us ( regardless of its horrific track record on that account ) .
According to what can be gleaned from ARI fellows ' various assertions and retorts in these matters , anybody who believes otherwise is living in the land of Oz ( reflecting a choice debate tactic of Bill O'Reilly ) .
From their admonitions , similar to politicians who continue to exploit 9/11 , you 'd think that terrorists had been attacking us on a frequent basis here in America .
But even if that were the case , it still would n't justify the United States ' military and all those alphabet soup coercive agencies taking action ' for , in the process of making us " safe , " they would assuredly kill and maim many more thousands of innocent people , further damage the American economy , and violate what 's left of our liberties .
Some good ol ' Randian premise - checking definitely clarifies this issue .
History and the current state of political affairs demonstrate that we should know better than to fall for the rhetoric of " freedom and security , " essentially empty promises of a future in which our families and friends are protected from evildoers by employees of government ( and their tax - fed contractors ) .
After all , governmental " officials " are fellow flesh - and - blood human beings .
But that 's only a small part of the problem .
Instead of relying on profits and reputation as proper feedback about their supposed protection services , employees of government " legally " use coercive power to tax and regulate people , for the so - called common good .
They can't save us from the dangers that they themselves have created .
Instead of understanding the nature of terrorism , as well as the nature of liberty , the State 's employees and those who support them engage in endless programs and policies to systematically control people and destroy their freedoms whenever such actions serve their interests ( i.e. , whenever people in general tolerate such actions ) .
For instance , the Israeli government ( with help ) builds a bigger , stronger police State and a system of checkpoints and walls to supposedly obstruct potential terrorists .
The U.S. government is in the rights - violating process of building a wall too , ostensibly to keep all us freedom - loving people in and all those law - breaking people out 'in concert with a police State to keep track of all potential wrongdoers , i.e. , each and every person who seeks to move freely .
It 's crucial that Americans and everyone else who cares about freedom recognize the profound distinction between a voluntarily funded militia that 's organized ad hoc to retaliate effectively and efficiently against a cabal ( or even army ) of wrongdoers versus a military that 's devised and managed by government to occupy for years and even decades hundreds of places around the globe .
While a voluntarily funded militia might be what 's needed to deal with any future terrorist groups who aggress against peaceful Americans , this requires a rights - respecting political foundation ' one that 's reflective of a peaceful America .
The fact of the matter is this : The U.S. government ( from national to local ) is by far the biggest violator of Americans ' rights , and therefore by far the biggest threat to our lives , security , and freedoms .
To my knowledge , the only politician who has the honesty and common sense to acknowledge this is , of course , Congressman Ron Paul .
He promotes the Austrian school 's principles of free market economics , while other politicians promote the statist views of every aspiring central planner since the dawn of civilization .
In spite of his contradictory domestic views about " illegal immigration " and " border security " ( and " rights " of dependent fetuses ) , he does realize that the only way to deal with terrorism and protect individual liberty is to enact a foreign policy of non-intervention , which includes abolishing all governmental or military " aid " to other countries .
Only then will the inhabitants of countries in the Middle East lack reasons to hate the U.S. government , and by extension Americans who champion its employees ' coercive methods of operation and funding .
Perhaps then they 'll start hating only their own governments , for which they 'll have no one else to blame .
Most people in the Middle East and elsewhere really like America ; it 's a dynamic and capital - rich marketplace of goods , services , and ideas .
It represents , in theory at least , a great land of opportunities for anyone wanting to flourish and willing to be productive ' " a shining city on a hill . "
They just detest the depraved institution that casts a shadow on our city and the rest of the world .
The U.S. government 's empire might be one of the worst kinds , because its citizens tend to view themselves as free and , hence , its coercive actions as benevolent .
Of course , the actual individuals who are orchestrating and participating in this madness know full well what they 're doing , and how large their bank accounts are getting on account of it .
Far from being the selfless do - gooders that ARI folks contend , they are selfish in the most irrational way ' sacrificing others ' lives and well - being for their own sakes .
In this age of pervasive authoritarian and collectivistic memes , fears and other strong emotions continue to hinder people 's better judgment .
Callous disregard for innocent people in terrible political systems is all too common , as is ignorance of individual rights , self - ownership , and personal sovereignty .
Though Ron Paul advocates a form of federal government that 's supposed to stay out of people 's consensual affairs ( no matter where they 're living ) , he must realize that so - called representative government itself is the problem :
As long as people support an institution that funds its operations coercively , i.e. , via taxation and fiat currency , and monopolizes the service of justice ( thus institutionalizing injustice ) , our rights will continue to be violated .
As a Congressman , Paul understands the immutable nature of bureaucracy and legislative corruption ; ' Dr. No ' knows how the game works .
Thus , he 's noted the importance of civil disobedience , or non-violent resistance , for inducing meaningful change in our culture .
Clearly , it 's high time to start firmly saying " No " to anything that 's not based on the principles of individualism , property rights , agency , and voluntary trade .
Each of us needs to hold strongly to our own liberty , and thus our society , as fear - mongers of all creeds constantly try to take perverse advantage of real or potential acts of terrorism .
Beware the intellectual and psychological guises of those who posture as your protectors or philosophical gurus .
Pay attention to the way they step .

The contract that Blackwater Security Consulting signed in March 2004 with Regency Hotel and Hospital of Kuwait for a 34 - person security team offers a view into the private - security business world .
The contract was made public last week by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee majority staff as part of its report on Blackwater 's actions related to an incident in Fallujah on March 31 , 2004 , when four members of the company 's security team were killed in an ambush .
According to data provided to the House panel , the average per-day pay to personnel Blackwater hired was $ 600 .
According to the schedule of rates , supplies and services attached to the contract , Blackwater charged Regency $ 1,075 a day for senior managers , $ 945 a day for middle managers and $ 815 a day for operators .
According to data provided to the House panel , Regency charged ESS an average of $ 1,100 a day for the same people .
How the Blackwater and Regency security charges were passed on by ESS to Halliburton 's KBR cannot easily be determined since the catering company was paid on a per-meal basis , with security being a percentage of that charge .
Army Gen. David H. Petraeus , the top U.S. commander in Baghdad overseeing more than 160,000 U.S. troops , makes roughly $ 180,000 a year , or about $ 493 a day .
That comes out to less than half the fee charged by Blackwater for its senior manager of a 34 - man security team .

While seeing Tim Russert embarrass Mitt Romney by waving flip flops in his face is satisfying on a true schadenfreude level , Mitt 's response to the flip flop charge should be looked at more closely as well ... because he never really disputes it .
Well , you know , Tim , I was always personally opposed to abortion , as I think almost everyone in this nation is and the question for me is the role of government .
And it was quite theoretical and philosophical to consider what the role of government should be in this regard and I felt the Supreme Court had spoken and government should n't be involved and let people make their own decisions .
And that all made a lot of sense to me , And then I became Governor , and the theoretical became reality , if you will .
So , let me see if I have this right ... when you were thinking about it , you respected the existing laws and the role government should play .
It was logical to you .
But then when the reality of respecting the rule of law came up for you , you just could n't quite do it , opting to place higher value on your personal beliefs .
Hmm ..is there any other way to consider this but flip - flopping ?
Romney is very careful to not bring his faith into the discussion of his change of heart , but I think the question must be asked in light of his " Freedom = Religion " speech : how many other established laws will you ignore because your faith or personal beliefs tell you otherwise ?
By Leo Babauta
I ’ve been wanting to write this post for a little while now , about an experiment I ’ve been doing .
For a few months , I ’ve been purposely binding myself .
Not as a way to hamstring myself , but as a way to make me focus on fewer , but more important things .
As a way to allow myself to do more in less time .
I ’m sure you ’ve heard of the Pareto principle , known also as the 80/20 rule .
While I do n’t think that the percentages of that rule are exact , the principle is true : you should focus on the few things that get you the most benefit .
But while that ’s nice in principle , in practice it ’s hardly ever done .
Why ?
Because we have too much thrown at us at once , and we ’re too busy juggling everything coming at us to take a minute and evaluate what ’s essential , what gets the most benefit for the least amount of effort , and what we should really focus on .
There ’s no systematic way to focus on the essential stuff , and eliminate the rest .
Until now .
I ’ve developed a system I call Haiku Productivity , based on some good ideas by others ( and I wo n’t be able to name them all , but know that I am indebted ) .
The key to Haiku Productivity is to limit yourself to an arbitrary but small number of things , forcing yourself to focus on the important stuff and eliminate all else .
Haiku : Limited but powerful
To understand this simple concept , think about the form of the haiku ( the common version , at least ) : it ’s poetry in 17 syllables , with 3 lines of 5 , 7 , and 5 syllables ( I know there are variations and this is only a rough definition , but that ’s not important to this article ) .
The point is that the form of the haiku is extremely limited , to a small number of lines and syllables .
What this does is forces the poet to focus on only those words that mean the most to the poem .
While other forms of poetry can go on for pages , haiku are short and compact .
As a result , haiku can be some of the most powerful poems in any language .
With such a limited form , you cannot just use any amount of words you want to express a concept .
You have to focus on one small but essential concept , and as a result you accomplish a lot with a few syllables .
That ’s what Haiku Productivity is .
Limited but Productive
So how does this apply to productivity ?
Well , if you think this will allow you to accomplish twice as many tasks , you ’re wrong .
You ’ll accomplish fewer tasks .
But you will most likely be more effective , because you will have to choose only the essential tasks — the ones that will give you the most benefit for your limited time .
What are the other benefits of Haiku Productivity , besides increased effectiveness ?
Besides forcing you to focus on essential tasks that have a large Return on Investment ( ROI ) , it forces you to eliminate the non-essential tasks .
No other system forces you to do that .
It forces you to make the best use of your time .
It forces you to limit the time you spend on things , which means you have more time for other things that are important to you , and you are able to focus on what you want to focus on , instead of everything coming at you .
It simplifies your life and makes you less stressed out .
Haiku Productivity : Place Limits on Everything
For those who enjoyed Zen To Done ( ZTD ) , this is an extension of those concepts .
The rule of Haiku Productivity is : put limits on everything you do .
That ’s it .
One rule .
What are the things you do ?
It ’s different for everyone , but common ones might be : email , RSS feeds , goals , time wasters , tasks .
What limits should you set ?
It ’s different for everyone .
And it ’s arbitrary ( there are no logical limits for anything — it ’s necessarily arbitrary ) but based on your own experience and experimentation .
Here are the limits I ’ve set for myself that seem to work — but remember that they will be different for you .
And also note that while there ’s a nice order to these , that ’s mostly coincidence ( I put them in a nice order ) , and there is no need to keep an order like this .
1 Goal :
The number of goals I ’m allowed to have at any one time .
I can only really focus on one goal at a time … any more than that and I lose focus and energy .
2 times to process email :
If I only allow myself to check email twice a day , I can not let email control my life .
It makes me much more efficient .
When I process email , I process to empty .
Now , there are other times during the day when I have to send email , such as emailing a post to one of my editors .
At that time , I might respond quickly to one or two emails , but I do n’t process my email during that time .
3 MITs : I choose three Most Important Tasks for each day , and focus completely on these .
Any more than that and I might not get them all done .
4 batch tasks : Aside from MITs , I also give myself 4 smaller tasks that I try to batch all at once .
This usually takes me 30 - 60 minutes at the end of the day .
5 sentence emails : I got this idea from Mike Davidson , whose article came at a perfect time as I was limiting other things in my life , and was also trying to keep my emails short at that time .
His 5 - sentence rule ( no email can be longer than 5 sentences ) fit in perfectly with everything else I tried to do , and I ’ve adopted it .
It forces you to write only what ’s essential .
I broke the rule at first , but I ’ve been pretty good lately .
This rule also limits the amount of time you spend replying to email , and makes processing a breeze .
6 RSS posts : I ’ve been adjusting this as I ’ve experimented , but I ’ve settled on reading 6 posts per day .
The method : I open my Google Reader in list view , scan through the headlines , and choose just 6 to read , opening them in new tabs .
I then “ Mark All as Read ” and go and read my 6 posts in further detail .
It has made RSS reading super fast .
7 minutes of wasted time :
This is just for fun , but when I ’ve done a task , I reward myself with 7 minutes of being able to do anything I want .
That means I can read a humor site , or go and read comments on this blog , or look through Delicious or Digg or a forum , or whatever I want .
For only 7 minutes .
Then I get back to work .
This allows me to have a little fun sprinkled throughout my day , but limits it .
I set a timer .
Totally works .
10 RSS feeds :
While I ’ve talked about reducing my RSS feeds before , I got the idea of only having 10 feeds from a friend , Ann , who bested my 16 feeds ( at the time ) with only 10 of her own .
I thought that was a great idea , and now I only allow myself to subscribe to 10 feeds .
That means I have to choose the 10 that give me the absolute best info for the time I spend reading them .
100 things :
Actually , I have n’t done this , but it was one of the inspirations for this post , so I had to list it .
It ’s also something I ’d like to try out in the near future .
I do n’t think it ’ll be that difficult for me , as I doubt I have much more than 100 things .
But anyway , the gist is that blogger Dave Bruno decided to do a 100 thing challenge , where he keeps only 100 personal items ( not counting books , and not counting non-personal items such as dishes , cleaning supplies , etc. ) .
Read the entire series .
100 things is , of course , an arbitrary limit , but again , that ’s the idea : set a goal and try to limit yourself to it .
Again , your limits and the things you limit will vary depending on your situation .
I am in no way suggesting that you adopt these limits .
But by restricting yourself to a small number of things , you force yourself to focus only on the essential .
It ’ll make a world of difference .
Give it a try , and let me know what you think .
Frank Rich on Nixon , Bush , and ' failed presidents '
RAW STORY
Published : Saturday June 2 , 2007 Print This Email
This " Failed presidents ai n't what they used to be , " writes Frank Rich for his Sunday New York Times article this week .
Comparing notes on two men whom many consider to be among the worst presidents in modern history , Rich concludes that while Nixon 's overarching paranoia and need for control earned the deep - seated hatred of many Americans , President Bush is simply " too slight to hate . "
" Unlike Nixon , President Bush is less an overreaching Machiavelli than an epic blunderer surrounded by Machiavellis , " writes Rich .
" He lacks the crucial element of acute self - awareness that gave Nixon his tragic depth . "
Analyzing a current state of affairs that has promoted a backlash that , while agressive and all - encompassing , has differed markedly from the impeachment of Richard M. Nixon .
Most Americans " simply wish the Bush presidency would end , " Rich writes , and would rather hold out for someone to undue the present damange .
While Americans are nearly uniform in their dissatisfaction with the direction the country is going in , each party is rife with crippling infighting and political disunity .
Trapped by their need for party - line adherence , Rich notes that " what the angriest proselytizers on the left and right have in common is a conviction that their political parties will commit hara - kiri if they do n't adhere to their bases ' strict ideological orders . "
Despite all the gridlocked rhetoric , Rich believes , American are moving towards clear change on the issues that are currently dividing their parties the most , Iraq and immigration .
" This relatively unified America can't be compared with that of the second Nixon term , when the violent cultural and political upheavals of the late 1960s were still fresh .
But in at least one way there may be a precise political parallel in the aftermaths of two failed presidencies rent by catastrophic wars :
Americans are exhausted by anger itself and are praying for the mood pendulum to swing . "

They ’re ginning up another war , and the target is Iran .
While the propaganda campaign started shortly after we invaded Iraq , with Rummy and the President ratcheting up the warlike rhetoric early on , the accusations and threats against Iran have lately taken on a new urgency .
Whereas in the early Rumsfeld era we mainly restricted ourselves to warning Tehran against meddling in our newly - acquired province , these days we are blaming the mullahs for our failure to stabilize the country : Iraq wo n’t stay conquered , dammit , and it must be the Iranians ’ fault  that ’s the narrative the War Party is pushing to rationalize the ongoing disaster , while simultaneously making the case for opening up a new front .
And an increasing number of Americans are falling for it .
A new Zogby poll says 52 percent of the American people favor attacking Iran to prevent them from acquiring nuclear weapons .
A recent Pew survey similarly indicates that war hysteria is on the rise , with 82 percent convinced that a nuclear - armed Iran would pass off nukes to terrorists , and two - thirds believing Iran is likely to attack the US .
The yearlong hate - fest directed at Tehran is clearly paying off .
I ca n’t say I ’m surprised .
After all , as of this past summer , 41 percent of the American people still believe Saddam Hussein was responsible for planning , financing , and / or carrying out the 9/11 terrorist attacks .
Gee , I wonder how they got that impression .
The neocons are giving us the same song - and - dance that preceded our last glorious Middle Eastern " victory "  as administration spokesmen conjure the Halloweenish specter of mad- mullahs - with - nukes , the " evidence " is being doctored , massaged , and otherwise manipulated to fit the War Party ’s stipulations .
Get ready for another massive " intelligence failure " and cries of " But everybody thought they had weapons of mass destruction ’ ! "
Yet , one has to ask : how many times are we going to fall for this guff ?
To begin with , there is no chance Iran will have a nuclear weapon in anything short of 5 to 10 years : a few thousand centrifuges , while it sounds impressive , is not the equivalent of a nuke factory .
It would take many more thousands to enrich uranium to weapons - grade quality , and Iran has n’t got the technical capability to construct and maintain such a large - scale operation , as pointed out by as Peter Beaumont , foreign - affairs editor of The Observer .
Secondly , even if Iran did one day join its neighbors Israel and Pakistan in the nuclear club , there is every reason to believe that " we have the power to deter " them , as General Abizaid put it : “ Let ’s face it , we lived with a nuclear Soviet Union , we ’ve lived with a nuclear China , and we ’re living with ( other ) nuclear powers as well . ”
The real fear , however , is that a nuclear - armed Iran would pose a threat to the continental United States by passing off the technology to a terrorist group , such as al - Qaeda .
It does n’t matter that this is the most unlikely scenario of them all : no nuclear power would ever give a non-state actor access to such technology for fear of the fallout , quite literally .
With al - Qaeda in possession of nuclear weapons , the likelihood that they would attack Iran , or someplace nearby , is quite high  far more plausible a scenario than the dim prospect of somehow smuggling a nuke into the US , or delivering it by some other means .
Yet no matter how far - fetched the possibility , even such a slim chance conjures a nighmarish fear , and that , in turn , is not quite rational .
This fear of nukes , and of another 9/11 , was the clincher in the run-up to the last war .
These two themes were so skillfully interwoven , and evoked , that , in spite of the prolonged debunking of the alleged Saddam - Osama connection , the myth persists to this day .
In fact , it worked so well the last time around that the War Party , in preparing for it ’s next act , is engaged in a vast recycling project , revamping some pretty familiar lies , half - truths , and cherry - picked bits of " intelligence , " albeit with a new twist .
Think of the time , energy , and money they ’ll be saving : they do n’t need new propaganda , all they have to do is haul out the old stuff , insert Iran in place of Iraq , and replace Saddam Hussein with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
That was Winston Smith ’s job at the Ministry of Truth , and his real - world equivalents are getting awfully good at it : why , just look at those poll numbers .
How do we account for the sudden rise of a new war hysteria , this time directed against Iran ?
While the administration has turned up the volume of its anti-Iranian rhetoric , and the mass media has duly  and largely uncritically  reported it , this is only part of the reason for the ominous uptick .
The core reason is that we ’re entering the political season , and none of the presidential candidates presented to us as " major " will take war with Iran off the table : indeed , the Republicans  with one exception  seem to be competing with each other to see who can take the most ferociously provocative stance .
When it comes to Iran , the Democrats are almost as bad  and , in the case of the putative frontrunner , perhaps even worse .
As Bill Safire put it on " Meet the Press " last Sunday , in the context of discussing Hillary ’s possible picks for the VP slot ,
" What about Rahm Emanuel , the most powerful voice in the House of Representatives that agrees with Hillary Clinton on foreign affairs .
He ’s a hawk .
And although he ’s a rootin ’ tootin’ liberal on domestic affairs , he is a hawk on foreign affairs .
I was at the a roast for him for Epilepsy Association , and Hillary Clinton was there , and I said , quite frankly , here you have the hawkish side of the Democratic Party .
If they get together , the bumper sticker will read  Invade and bomb with Hillary and Rahm . ’ "
As the issues are increasingly framed in terms of presidential politics , there is little vocal opposition to the rush to war with Iran , even in the supposedly " antiwar " Democratic party .
Many of the same people who think George W. Bush is a war criminal who lied us into invading Iraq will nonetheless dutifully pull the lever for Hillary , who has criticized the president for being soft on the mullahs .
Having already given her moral and political sanction for attacking Iran by voting for the Kyl - Lieberman resolution  which , even in the slightly watered - down version passed by the Senate , provides enough cover for the Bush administration , or its successor , to claim the authority to take military action  Hillary Clinton will inherit and continue the neocons ’ wars , and will be no less committed to " victory . "
Americans see their leading politicians " debating , " but none of them are opposing war with Iran : indeed , they all seem to be going along with it , with a few exceptions  and these exceptions , precisely because they are n’t going along to get along , are invariably dismissed by the pundits as " minor " or " fringe " candidates , who cannot under any circumstances be taken seriously .
The majority of Americans now want a definite deadline for the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq , and yet not a single " major " candidate for president proposes such a course .
What ’s more , if he or she did , they would be immediately relegated to second or third - tier status , even as their campaign fundraising dried up for reasons convincingly explained by Wesley Clark .
Beating the drums for war , the Israel lobby is pulling out all the stops , and this time they are out in the open about it .
The fear that the Lobby would be too visible in promoting Israel ’s interests motivated them to keep a relatively low profile during the run-up to war with Iraq , but it is n’t holding them back now .
AIPAC , for one , is openly leading the charge for war , and , as the overwhelming vote in favor of Kyl - Lieberman indicates , they are doing a bang - up job of it .
The Democrats are terrified of the Lobby : the loss of all that New York money , which is essential for Hillary ’s victory , would be a disaster for them .
Not that there is much danger of Hillary forgetting her good friends in the military - industrial complex , who have donated more to her than to all the others combined .
She , after all , has a lot to prove : can a woman be a tough commander - in - chief ?
Faced with a " choice " between someone who is bound to over - compensate in the direction of unreasonable belligerence , and Rudy Giuliani  well , all I can say is , ai n’t " democracy " wonderful ?
Public opinion is shaped , in part , by the political discourse , and when it comes to foreign policy , rather than debating , the two parties are singing a duet .
As the Iraq war widens into a burgeoning conflict with Iran , and not a single major political figure rises to oppose it , we are stumbling into an even bigger quagmire than the one in which we are presently immersed .
Gen .
Abizaid says that we ’ll be in Iraq for the next 50 years : if we go to war with Iran , make that a century or so .
5 Things You Didn't Know : Starbucks
Page 1 of 2
They are largely responsible for turning a diner ’s 50 - cent cup of joe into a travesty , or at the very least , a pedestrian pursuit .
Their " stores " seem to be everywhere , and they ’re populated by coffee snobs on both sides of the counter .
They appear either indifferent to , or beyond the reach of , fluctuating economies .
They are accused of everything from the annoying ( market saturation ) to the serious ( anti-competition ) , yet Starbucks — the world ’s biggest coffee peddler — keeps on peddling .
There may be no better example of the company ’s imperialist domination — and the scorn they sometimes inspire — than the shocking installation of a Starbucks store in Beijing ’s Forbidden City in 2000 .
You ca n’t blame Starbucks for salivating over the real estate ; almost 9 million people visited the former home to 24 different Chinese emperors in 2006 .
Nonetheless , it took seven years of protesting , 500,000 signatures and a refusal on Starbucks ’ part to sell other brands to finally drive them out in 2007 .
Love 'em or hate 'em , here are five things you may not know about Starbucks , your friendly , ubiquitous coffee house .
1- On average , two new Starbucks have opened every day since 1987
Starbucks has been around since 1971 , but it was n’t aggressive about expansion until 1987 , when the company came under the ownership of its current chairman , Howard Schulz .
At that time , there were only nine Starbucks stores .
Today , there are about 14,396 ( give or take a few ) .
Divide that number by 20 years , or 7,300 days and , after rounding up , you get an average of 2 stores per day opening every day for the last 20 years .
Naturally , this figure does not include the few stores that , for whatever reason , were shut down .
2- Its name comes from Moby Dick
Confirmed by the company ’s current fact sheet , Starbucks was named for the first mate of the Pequod in Melville ’s .
The question is , why ?
After all , the company seems more like Captain Ahab than Starbuck .
In the famous novel , Starbuck and Ahab are at opposite ends of the philosophical spectrum : the first mate is superstitious and conservative , Ahab is narcissistic and monomaniacal .
Starbuck is practical , opposing Ahab ’s desire to commit the Pequod to circling the world ’s oceans in search of the white whale in favor of a commitment to harpooning whales they can sell on the Nantucket Market .
Ahab is single - minded , bent on not only killing the white whale , but also on relieving mankind of the source of its evil .
Swap out a few of the right words above with terms like " market domination " and " its competition , " and you have Ahab ’s , the world ’s biggest coffee peddler .
The only ostensible Starbuck - like thing about Starbucks is the conservative evolution of its logo .
It used to feature a bare - breasted mermaid but has , over time , developed a degree of modesty that would please the Pequod ’s first mate : Initially , her hair covered her breasts , then they were cut out of the frame altogether .
3- Its founders sold Starbucks in 1987 to build Peet 's Coffee & Tea
1966 : Alfred Peet opens Peet ’s Coffee & Tea in Berkeley , California .
1971 : Jerry Baldwin and two other friends of Alfred Peet open the first Starbucks in Seattle .
1982 : Howard Schultz joins Starbucks .
1984 : Baldwin et al buy out Peet’s .
1987 : Baldwin et al sell Starbucks to Schultz to focus on building Peet’s .
Here ’s the condensed company time line :

Effects of moderate - intensity endurance and high - intensity intermittent training on anaerobic capacity and VO2max .
Tabata I , Nishimura K , Kouzaki M , Hirai Y , Ogita F , Miyachi M , Yamamoto K .
Department of Physiology and Biomechanics , National Institute of Fitness and Sports , Kagoshima Prefecture , Japan .
This study consists of two training experiments using a mechanically braked cycle ergometer .
First , the effect of 6 wk of moderate - intensity endurance training ( intensity : 70 % of maximal oxygen uptake ( VO2 max ) , 60 min.d - 1 , 5 d.wk - 1 ) on the anaerobic capacity ( the maximal accumulated oxygen deficit ) and VO2max was evaluated .
After the training , the anaerobic capacity did not increase significantly ( P > 0.10 ) , while VO2max increased from 53 +/- 5 ml.kg - 1 min-1 to 58 +/- 3 ml.kg-1.min-1 ( P < 0.01 ) ( mean +/- SD ) .
Second , to quantify the effect of high - intensity intermittent training on energy release , seven subjects performed an intermittent training exercise 5 d.wk - 1 for 6 wk .
The exhaustive intermittent training consisted of seven to eight sets of 20-s exercise at an intensity of about 170 % of VO2max with a 10-s rest between each bout .
After the training period , VO2max increased by 7 ml.kg - 1.min - 1 , while the anaerobic capacity increased by 28 % .
In conclusion , this study showed that moderate - intensity aerobic training that improves the maximal aerobic power does not change anaerobic capacity and that adequate high - intensity intermittent training may improve both anaerobic and aerobic energy supplying systems significantly , probably through imposing intensive stimuli on both systems .

Effect of exercise intensity and duration on post exercise energy expenditure .
Sedlock DA , Fissinger JA , Melby CL .
Exercise Physiology Laboratory , Purdue University , West Lafayette , IN 47907 .
The purpose of this study was to examine 1 ) the effect of two exercise intensities of equal caloric output on the magnitude ( kcal ) and duration of excess postexercise oxygen consumption ( EPOC ) and 2 ) the effect of exercise of equal intensity but varying duration on EPOC .
Ten trained male triathletes performed three cycle ergometer exercises : high intensity - short duration ( HS ) , low intensity - short duration ( LS ) , and low intensity - long duration ( LL ) .
Baseline VO2 was measured for 1 h prior to each exercise condition .
Postexercise VO2 was measured continuously until baseline VO2 was achieved .
The duration of EPOC was similar for HS ( 33 +/- 10 min ) and LL ( 28 +/- 14 min ) , and both were significantly longer ( P less than 0.05 ) than the EPOC following LS ( 20 +/- 5 min ) .
However , total net caloric expenditure was significantly more ( P less than 0.05 ) for HS ( 29 +/- 8 kcal ) than for either LS ( 14 +/- 6 kcal ) or LL ( 12 +/- 7 kcal ) .
The exercise conditions used in this study did not produce a prolonged EPOC .
However , the exercise intensity was shown to affect both the magnitude and duration of EPOC , whereas the exercise duration affected only the duration of EPOC .
Moreover , the duration of EPOC and the subsequent caloric expenditure were not necessarily related .
Based on the resulting magnitude of the postexercise energy expenditure , it is possible that EPOC may be of some value for weight control over the long term .

Last.fm , the music recommendation site owned by US media conglomerate CBS , has today given Pirate Bay the thumbs up to use its servers to add radio streams to BitTorrent searches .
The Swedish anti-copyright site has added a Last .fm widget to results pages as part of a new drop - down of extra information on artists ( blog post here ) .
A spokesman for London - based Last.fm told The Reg that while it would not seek to endorse Pirate Bay , it has no control over who uses its API .
Even if it did , to stop Pirate Bay would n't be " in the spirit of " the API , he said .
Last.fm's main service is providing music recommendations which it does by matching similar users ' tastes , and creating bespoke radio streams around them .
The use of its servers by Pirate Bay marks an interesting test of the trend for websites to offer their own API .
The API acquiescence is unlikely to win fans in the beleaguered record industry .
The site spent months itself courting labels to assure its own legal status , while its parent company CBS is a major owner of US music radio stations .
Pirate Bay 's outspoken stance against rights holders meanwhile , as well as publicity - seeking antics , have marked it out for special resentment from record industry bodies such as the Recording Industry Ass. of America .
Servers were seized by Swedish authorities following US pressure last year , but the site quickly reemerged .
The UK's BPI was n't immediately available for comment .
As well as its main network station , CBS also runs a TV channel with Warner Brothers Entertainment in the US called The CW .
Warner sits on the board of the Motion Picture Ass. of America , which has alleged that the operators of the Pirate Bay are profiteering criminals .
CBS paid $ 280 m for Last.fm in May this year , but these are choppy waters for the site to navigate .
At the time of the CBS takeover its founders pledged to continue under its original principles of openness and sharing music .
They also welcomed the massive cash injection . ®
A little over a week ago , reviews of Asus 's Eee PC 701 started to trickle out onto the Internet .
Some of the larger publications , like CNet and LAPTOP Magazine got their hands on the unit first , but as it has become more widely available sites like HotHardware and PC Perspective have now put out their own reviews of the Eee PC .
The overall verdict is fairly unanimous : the device 's keyboard is a bit cramped , but in terms of price , performance , and features the Eee PC hits the trifecta .
Indeed , Asus appears to have gotten so many things right with the Eee PC that it could be a game - changer in the mobile market , in terms of both hardware and software .
Instead of rehashing the reviews , which you can read on your own , let me draw a few lessons from the Eee PC launch that I think are important for the mobile space going into 2008 .
Intel wins , and Microsoft loses
Thanks to its combination of Intel hardware and a non-bloated Linux install , reviewers found that Asus 's little laptop performs just as well as much larger and more expensive Windows notebooks .
And the company spent enough time tweaking the unit 's default Linux distro that Windows users will supposedly feel right at home .
The device does support Windows XP , but Linux seems to be the OS of choice for all of the reviewers for performance and ease - of - use reasons .
In this respect , Microsoft has well and truly blown it , because this device is poised to introduce a few million Best Buy shoppers to a pleasantly usable , non-embedded Linux distro .
Even more ominous from Redmond 's perspective is the fact that the Eee PC is just one of a breaking wave of Linux - powered portable devices that will reach consumers in the coming year , and that it 's the hardware makers that are driving the Linux push .
The absence of Microsoft at the recent , mobile - centric Intel Developer Forum was widely commented upon .
Intel showed off a raft of ultramobile PC ( UMPC ) , mobile internet device ( MID ) , and smartphone prototypes and mock - ups , all of which were Linux - powered .
And why not ?
Across the company , from the Terascale research initiative to the discrete GPU project to the enterprise power management efforts to the mobile division , every single forward - looking effort at Intel is very much a software effort , and all of those software efforts are Linux - and open source - based .
This is also true of ARM , which is looking to the open source community to provide the free razors that make its blades worth buying .
In fact , my most recent briefing on ARM 's mobile plans ( an article on this is coming soon ) was a mirror image of IDF — the form factors and Linux - powered software efforts were largely the same ; only the processor hardware was different .
In sum , Linux is now the popular quarterback at the new mobile party , and Microsoft is just that kid who used to be cool back in grade school when tetherball was the hot game and he was king of the pole .
If Microsoft wants to break back into the popular crowd , it 's going to have to put on something a bit fresher than Windows Mobile 6 , which feels like the operating system equivalent of feathered hair and tight - rolled jeans .
Significant shrinkage
The Eee PC 's main selling point is its form factor , and it's the form factor that has really blown the reviewers ' minds .
It seems that the Eee PC is small enough and light enough to attain a truly new level of portability and convenience , while still having just enough screen real estate and keyboard space to be comfortably usable .
The result is that reviewers have compared this device 's form factor to the UMPC and found the latter wanting .
The balance between size and usability that the Eee PC has struck could well be one that marks a sort of threshold in form factor design .
It 's likely that the keyboard + WIMP ( windows , icons , menus , pointer ) paradigm may not be able to shrink any further than the Eee PC 's form factor , due to the limits of human dexterity and visual acuity .
Anything smaller than the Eee PC will have to be built on a fundamentally different interface paradigm , and no , stylus + WIMP is probably not it .
If this turns out to be the case , then there will be a permanent gap in the market between the Eee PC and the Nokia N810 .
Here 's to the crazy ones .
The misfits .
The rebels ...
Here 's to Asus .
If nothing else , the Eee PC could demonstrate that there 's a whole device category out that 's waiting to be tapped : a wireless laptop that 's about the dimensions and weight of a trade paperback or journal ( i.e. , a large Moleskine ) , with only solid state storage ( no optical drive ) .
If Asus finds the kind of success with the Eee PC that the reviews would seem to indicate , then we 'll see the market spit out many more of these diskless devices in the coming year .
I 've actually been dying for Apple to release just such a device for about two years now , but the last time I brought it up here at Ars I got flamed by hordes of optical drive lovers ( !? ) .
( I can't find a link for this incident , so you 'll have to take my word for it . )
Maybe now is the time , though , for Cupertino to follow Asus 's lead and put some of that massive quantity of flash storage that it has locked up into something besides and iPod or an iPhone .
But regardless of who 's next — Apple , Lenovo , Nokia , or whoever — the Eee PC 's combination of form factor , performance , and mobile Linux is a prelude of things to come .
When Silverthorne and WiMAX debut in 2008 , we 'll see this category of device take on a whole new level of power and connectivity .
A few prominent black leaders remain on the fence .
Among those leaders is the Rev. Al Sharpton .
On Friday , in one sign of how vigorously he is being courted , Bill Clinton called into Mr. Sharpton ’s nationally syndicated radio talk show to explain his use of the phrase “ fairy tale ” in a critique of the Obama campaign this week .
The description angered many blacks , but Mr. Clinton said he was referring only to Mr. Obama ’s position on Iraq , not his candidacy .
Neither campaign has made firm decisions yet about television advertising and public appearances in the state , which has 5.3 million enrolled Democrats .
Their ranks could be swollen by last - minute registration efforts .
Unregistered New Yorkers had until Friday to enroll in order to be eligible to vote Feb .

The New York City Board of Elections said more than 13,000 forms had been filed in the last week alone .
In New Hampshire , Mr. Obama fared better among first - time primary voters .
On primary day , 232 of New York ’s 281 convention delegates will be in play , 151 of them elected by Congressional district and allotted in proportion to the candidate ’s total .
Some delegate slots are reserved for public officials and party leaders , and others are assigned by party officials .
Representative Anthony D. Weiner , a Clinton supporter who represents parts of Brooklyn and Queens , said the campaign dynamics have energized the Clinton camp , too .
“ It ’s now clear that her home state is going to play an important role in making her president , ” he said .
“ People are more excited about that than concerned . ”
He said he had not discerned any shift to Mr. Obama among Clinton supporters .
At least one has shifted the other way .
Neil Barsky , a Manhattan hedge - fund manager who raised money last year for Mr. Obama , said he now favored Mrs. Clinton .
“ I believe Hillary , while potentially less of a transformational candidate , would make an excellent president and is our best chance of winning , ” he said .
How Rumsfeld tried to influence British military policy - in the 1970s
The US politician who was America 's youngest ever secretary of defence - Donald Rumsfeld - attempted to influence British military policy in the mid-1970s , newly released government archives showed today .
Nearly 30 years before the invasion of Iraq , Rumsfeld wrote to his UK counterpart , Roy Mason , and the prime minister , James Callaghan , opposing plans for large - scale defence cuts .
The message , marked " Secret " and dated July 19 1976 , is a mixture of anxiety and flattery - mingled with the hint of a threat .
" You will understand my deep concern over reports that the British government is considering yet further reductions in the UK defence budget , " Rumsfeld wrote .
" The discussions among ministers at last month 's Defence Planning Committee underscored the growing appreciation by all Nato allies that the trend in the military balance with the Soviet Union is adverse .
Allied ministers at Brussels recognized that we must face up to the inevitable consequences - which are fundamentally unacceptable .
" Any reductions which weaken or appear to weaken your defences would impinge adversely and directly on the collective security of every ally .
Moreover any such action would impair the influence Britain exerts as a major European ally , which in turn will have important - and from our viewpoint regrettable - implications for the future cohesion of the Alliance and thus for European stability .
" It is my hope that you - together with your cabinet colleagues - will succeed in ensuring that any actions [ do ] not jeopardise our defence efforts . "

Scholars & Rogues :
Following up on my post from a little while back discussing Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell ’s desire to police the Internet , the Washington Post ’s Ellen Nakashima confirmed last weekend that the Decider had signed a classified directive authorizing the NSA to more expansively monitor intrusions on federal networks for signs of cyberattacks :
Until now , the government ’s efforts to protect itself from cyber- attacks — which run the gamut from hackers to organized crime to foreign governments trying to steal sensitive data — have been piecemeal .
Under the new initiative , a task force headed by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence ( ODNI ) will coordinate efforts to identify the source of cyber - attacks against government computer systems .
As part of that effort , the Department of Homeland Security will work to protect the systems and the Pentagon will devise strategies for counterattacks against the intruders .
As Brian has said recently , the U.S. is absolutely not ready to handle cyberwar on almost any front .
I ’m all in favor of redirecting tax money towards protecting and strengthening our Internet infrastructure against any one of the millions of crippling threats it can face , rather than expensive , crappy weapons systems that have little measurable effect except fattening defense contractors ’ coffers .
But in an expansive profile of Mike McConnell , the New Yorker ’s Lawrence Wright touches on the myriad obstacles our intelligence community faces towards handling a real threat , and why they get it wrong so often .
This tiny flashlight is about as minimal as it gets .
Just snap the little LED light unit onto the top of any 9 - volt battery , and voilà , you have a fully functional source of illumination .
The compact light includes a trio of super - bright LEDs , which should be plenty for helping you find your keys in the dark .
Thankfully , there ’s a power switch on top , so you can leave it attached to the battery when not in use .
While the design is clearly derivative of Richard Lawson ’s 9 - volt lights , I find these ones a bit more practical , while Lawson ’s are definitely more stylish .
Kikkerland expects to start shipping these 9 - Volt flashlights this October , and they should retail for under 10 bucks each .

Suite à la pandémie du Corona virus et toutes les conséquences qu'elle a engendré , les 27 pays membres de l'Union Européenne se sont entendus pour élaborer un plan de relance .
Mais au moment où ce dernier devrait être ratifié , la Hongrie et la Pologne ont bloqué son processus .
Comment et pour quelles raisons une telle situation s'est - elle produite ?...
Before his disastrous turn as the nation ’s attorney general , Alberto Gonzales was the White House counsel behind some of the administration ’s most egregious legal maneuvers , including President Bush ’s 2001 executive order unilaterally repealing the presumption of public access to presidential papers enshrined in the Presidential Records Act of 1978 .
The executive order , which Mr. Gonzales drafted , made it significantly harder for historians and the public to gain access to a former president ’s official records , and it provided an early glimpse of two Bush White House themes : a mania for secrecy and a dangerously inflated view of presidential authority to override existing law .
Six years and one Congressional power shift later , there is ample support in the House and Senate for repealing the executive order ’s cumbersome rules , which give presidents , former presidents and even their heirs power to withhold sensitive documents well beyond the standard 12 - year waiting period .
A bipartisan measure reversing the presumption of nondisclosure and reasonably limiting executive privilege claims passed the House in March by a veto - proof majority .
In June , it cleared Senate committee review .
Yet approval by the full Senate is in doubt because of a single Republican senator , Jim Bunning of Kentucky .
Mr. Bunning has declined to detail his reasons for exercising his senatorial prerogative to hold up consideration of the bill beyond telling The Dallas Morning News that the “ president ought to have the right to withhold any records he chooses . ”
His colleagues and all Americans are owed a fuller explanation of why he believes a politician ’s desire to hide embarrassing information for no legitimate reason of national security should trump the public ’s right to know .
Stuart has been working on using an allocator for Mozilla which has much better performance characteristics , especially with memory fragmentation and heap growth over time .
The allocator he chose is jemalloc , the default allocator for the FreeBSD libc .
On Linux , intercepting and replacing malloc is fairly easy , because of the way dynamic symbol loading works .
On Windows , however , it is difficult or impossible to intercept and redirect calls to malloc to a custom allocator .
So instead of trying to hook to a prebuilt CRT , I spent most of today hacking the Windows C runtime ( CRT ) , replacing the default allocator with jemalloc .
The Windows CRT sources come with VC8 professional edition so any licensed user may hack on them and redistribute the result as part of a larger program .
It comes with a mostly - working nmakefile1 : I had to disable the code which builds the managed - code CRT because apparently I do n’t have the right .NET headers installed .
Getting the new jemalloc.c file to build was n’t that hard , either : it required a few #defines , typedefs , and disabled warnings , but nothing serious .
The hardest part about replacing
It was figuring out what parts of the original CRT were heap - related and removing them correctly .
It was a wild ride , but I think that I have a build of the Windows CRT that works … at least small programs like xpidl and shlibsign work .
Unfortunately , according to the EULA2 I am not allowed to redistribute this modified CRT by itself .
So the only way you can get it is by distributing it with a Firefox build .
Also , I ’m not allowed to post the patch queue which I used to develop the custom CRT , because those patches may contain copyrighted code in context .
Do any of my readers know of a format that will alter a set of files according to a set of instructions without the instructions revealing the contents of the original files ?
I would really love it if Microsoft would release their C runtime code under a liberal open - source license … can someone suggest a good person to contact at Microsoft ?
Stuart will have some builds posted soon , once a few kinks get ironed out .
For Mozilla2 we ’re probably going to push the solution to an intermediary library : we will have a single allocator library which is used for both garbage - collected ( managed ) and explicitly allocated / freed ( unmanaged ) memory .
We will switch back to the standard CRT , but we will try to avoid using the standard CRT allocator at all .
See the “ space management ” thread on the tamarin - devel mailing list ( December and January ) for some background discussion .
nmake is one of the suckiest build systems on the planet .
I could get better results with a .vbs .
From the EULA , section 3.1 : … you agree : ( i ) except as otherwise noted in Section 2.1 ( Sample Code ) , to distribute the Redistributables only in object code form and in conjunction with and as a part of a software application product developed by you that adds significant and primary functionality to the Redistributables …

Throughout this week and last , Gamasutra is presenting a year - end retrospective , discussing notable games , events , developers , and industry figures of 2007 .
This time , we look at gaming 's top five most poignant moments .
If games were just toys , we 'd still love them , but we follow them as a medium because they affect us .
The question of emotional , personal engagement continues to persist this year , widely discussed in industry circles - just how essential it is , how to create it in an authentic way .
In a banner year , what will we remember about this year 's slate of titles ?
The answers are largely personal and subjective , but here are ours .
Our schoolyard factions from an era past never thought they 'd live to see the day .
While the Genesis and Super Nintendo once ran neck - in - neck , years later , one of the ongoing console wars ' most significant casualties eventually made its final departure from the battle , cemented with the defeat of the widely beloved Dreamcast .
resurrects one of the oldest and most significant rivalries in gaming , as the plumber and the Hedgehog go head to head for the very first time in history on Nintendo 's revolutionary , wildly successful console .
The Sega - loving eight - year - old in you stirs , quietly affronted , and those children of the Nintendo camp , now adults , extend the hand of magnanimity with this indisputable proof of their victory .
And those for whom the rivalry still lives can battle for the banner of their youth , the Olympic competition presented in the game invested with just a little bit more for that old , old grudge .
is perhaps a lesson in the perils of over - ambitiousness , but the fateful , grim allegory of Jackie Estacado gets one thing right - early on in the game , you have the opportunity to merelywith girlfriend Jenny .
No button sequences , dialogue pickers or elaborate cutscenes - it 's simple human bonding on the player 's terms .
When has gameplay ever incorporated watching an entire film with a girl 's head in your lap ?
The poignancy of the mundane stands out here in sharp contrast to a largely overwrought and comic - bookish theme , and this undecorated scene alone provides a lens of sincerity through which to interpret the rest of the game , a context for real human motivation - and later , devastation .
contains enough player - driven story elements to occupy invested players for as long as they like - the lore alone could equate to hours of gleeful reading for sci - fi buffs .
And the character creation screen alone is a delightfully liberating exercise , one which it 's easy to conceive of repeating over and over , just because you We 've never quite been able to shape a character in our mind 's eye in a console title the waypermitted us to , imbuing Shepard with a sense of personalized humanity before the game even begins - but it does n't stop there .
Shepard can make like humans do with one of his or her comrades - as we know , because we 've watched it on YouTube a million times .
Though there 's much more to the game than an alien lesbian sex scene , you can customize a female character down to the most minute of details , and then have her get it on with a female alien - and it ' sa hentai game .
Of course , gamers love visual thrills , but hopefully it's not too generous to say that the real feat is thatis the first to understand our need for intimacy with our characters and their worlds , and to grant it to us to such an extent - to give us a choice of partner , and to give us the option of declining those relations altogether ( are you ? )
Scenes that take control away from the player are nothing new .
But in this pivotal situation , control is the crux of the issue - having just realized that you are little more than the puppet of forces who want you to kill your own father , being able to take control might have saved you .
Morally - and probably physically - unable to fight his unfortunate son , Andrew Ryan makes the bequeathing of his principles his final act .
It is n't the Little Sister choice or your inability to achieve redemption should you wish it that makesa linear game - it's this moment , wherethose wicked ones high on their plasmid - enhanced power and those careful agents of salvation must face their complete helplessness .'s real thought - provoking question is n't " harvest or rescue " - would you have let Ryan live , if you could have ?
A simple instruction from a schizophrenic computer , and a few pink hearts .
It survives for one single level , and yet the Aperture Science Weighted Companion Cube has attained memetic , unforgettable status .
While game designers and gamers alike struggle to pin down the formula for creating true emotional connection , an utterly inanimate object achieves it with all the ease of an accident .
No one wanted to drop the beloved little block into a fire , and a good majority of us struggled to find some way , any way to carry it with us .
And perhaps if we'd been able to bring it along until level design simply forced us to discard it , or until we accidentally dropped it into that greenish - brown swampy water , we 'd feel a pang of regret and then move on , as we have with many portable support objects , from Yoshi to hypnotized Big Daddies to simple protective items .
But GLaDOS , who we named character of the year for exactly this brand of manipulation , enforces our engagement by mocking our sentimentality , highlighting as irrational our attachment to the only decidedly non-hostile object we had on the bizarre testing course .
Losing the cube in this particular way makes us as responsible for it as we were when it was given us .
GLaDOS is still alive , but you incinerated your faithful companion cube more quickly than any test subject on record .
Congratulations .
Updated UK - based consumer finance website MoneySavingExpert.com was forced to pull most of its services over the weekend as a result of an ongoing denial of service attack .
The site was hit at 1700 on Friday hours before launching a high - profile campaign against insurance rip - offs .
Services were largely restored by 1000 on Monday .
The attack has left a guide to reclaiming mis-sold Payment Protection Insurance ( PPI ) temporarily unavailable .
Martin Lewis , who runs the site , said the mis-selling of PPI to people applying for personal loans and credit cards is rife .
He recently started a campaign to reclaim the cost of loan and card insurance .
MoneySavingExpert.com - a self - billed " consumer revenge " site - claims it is used by over three million people in the UK a month .
The assault on the site by unknown assailants came on the same day as the launch of Lewis 's PPI reclaim campaign .
Lewis reckons the timing of the attack is " probably not a coincidence " .
The perpetrators of the attack remain unidentified .
Sometimes such attacks are motivated by blackmail but Lewis said it has received no approach from those behind the assault .
MoneySavingExpert.com has campaigned on a variety of issues beyond its recent PPI push , activities that have earned its share of enemies over the years .
" We 've cost some people a lot of money by telling consumers what to do , " Lewis told El Reg .
Denial of service attacks involve rendering websites unusable , sometimes for prolonged periods that can reach into days .
Attackers commonly start off with cruder forms of attack ( such as a SYN Flood ) before increasing the sophistication of the attack to confuse and confound a site 's defenders .
Bringing the site back online after what Lewis described as a " phenomenal DDoS attack " proved a tall order .
Minor glitches remain .
" We 're doing well at repelling that for the main site ; although doing it for the forums is much more difficult , " he said .
However clever or sophisticated the attack might be , it 's probably done little beyond temporarily delaying some PPI claims .
The assault might even draw wider attention to the issue .
MoneySavingExpert.com 's PPI reclaiming guide and free template letters are due to be included in its weekly MoneySaving email , or via Google 's cache here , pending full restoration of the site . ®
WASHINGTON  One of Al Qaeda 's senior theologians is calling on his followers to end their military jihad and saying the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , were a " catastrophe for all Muslims . "
In a serialized manifesto written from prison in Egypt , Sayyed Imam al - Sharif is blasting Osama bin Laden for deceiving the Taliban leader , Mullah Omar , and for insulting the Prophet Muhammad by comparing the September 11 attacks to the early raids of the Ansar warriors .
The lapsed jihadist even calls for the formation of a special Islamic court to try Osama bin Laden and his old comrade Ayman al - Zawahri .
The disclosures from Mr. Sharif , also known as Dr. Fadl and Abd al - Qadir ibn Abd al - Aziz , have already opened a rift at the highest levels of Al Qaeda .
The group 's deputy , Ayman al - Zawahri , a former associate of the defecting theologian in Egypt , personally mocked him last month in a video , remarking that he was unaware Egyptian prisons had fax machines .
Meanwhile , leading Western analysts are saying the defection of Mr. Sharif indicates the beginning of the end for Al Qaeda .
The author of " Inside Al Qaeda , " Rohan Gunaratna said in an interview this week , " There is nothing more important than a former jihadist as important as Dr. Fadl criticizing the jihadist vanguard . "
Mr. Gunaratna , who acts at times as a consultant for American and Western intelligence , described the reformed theologian as " both an ideologue and operational leader , but he was primarily an ideologue . "
An expert on Islamic terrorism with the Jamestown Foundation , Steven Ulph , also said the defection of Mr. Sharif could hemorrhage support for Al Qaeda .
" The important point to make , when you have the combination of a respected ideologue , plus someone who was in the field , say these things it is more important than having a Saudi sheik that moderates his message , " he said .
The director of the Homeland Security Policy Institute at George Washington University , Frank Cilluffo , said , " Here you have someone with the stature and credibility , who more or less wrote the book on jihadism and is oft cited by other jihadists , making the case against it .
This is someone with the heft on legal and religious grounds to make the counter argument that we can't . "
Mr. Sharif , currently serving a life sentence in an undisclosed Egyptian prison , wrote in the 1980s two of the modern seminal texts for Sunni jihadism and in particular Al Qaeda , in " Fundamental Concepts Regarding Jihad " and " The Five Ground Rules for the Achieving of Victory or Its Absence . "
Those books are scholarly justifications , citing the Koran and Hadiths , for joining a war against Muslim apostates such as the Egyptian ruling class and for a broader jihad against the far enemy of America .
Originally rounded up in the arrests following the 1981 assassination of Egyptian president , Anwar Sadat , Mr. Sharif served in an Egyptian jail with Ayman al - Zawahri , who would later go on to be the deputy to Mr. bin Laden .
In 2001 , shortly after the September 11 attacks , Mr. Sharif was arrested in Yemen and was later sent to Egypt in 2003 or 2004 .
His latest texts are a renunciation of his earlier work , saying the military jihad or war against apostate states and America is futile .
But the ex-jihadist also calls into question the virtue of Mr. bin Laden and Mr. Zawahri .
In some ways the manifesto reads in parts like a spicy Washington memoir by an embittered former official .
Of his old associates he writes , " Bin Laden , al - Zawahri , and others fled at the beginning of the American bombing [ in Afghanistan ] , to the point of abandoning their wives and families to be killed along with other innocent people , " according to a translation provided by the Middle East Media Research Institute .
It goes on , " I think that a sharia court should be established , composed of reliable scholars , to hold these people accountable for their crimes  even if in absentia  so that those who are ignorant in their religion do not repeat this futility . "
Mr. Sharif also says Mr. Zawahri informed on his friends after he was arrested following the Sadat assassination in 1981 .
" I do n't know of anyone in Islamic history having committed such deceit , fraud , falsification , and betrayal of trust with such hostility to someone else 's book , and perverted it - no one before Ayman al - Zawahri , " he wrote .
Last month , in a video produced by Al Qaeda 's production company , Mr. Zawahri said the latest recantations from his one time friend were the result of torture , asking if the electrical current for the fax machine he used to serialize his new book in the Arabic press also powered the prison 's electric chair .
Egypt has been singled out by Human Rights Watch and other human rights groups for the practice of torture in its prisons , particularly the use of electric shocks .
In February , a man named Abu Omar who claimed to be kidnapped by the CIA and transported to an Egyptian prison described in detail how he was tortured during his interrogations by Egypt 's security services .
On Monday , an American intelligence official familiar with the interrogation of Mr. Sharif said that in 2004 the Al Qaeda cleric was tortured .
" All I am saying is that screw drivers were involved , " this official , who asked to be anonymous , said .
When asked if Mr. Sharif was tortured , Mr. Gunaratna responded by saying , " He spent time in an Egyptian prison . "
But Mr. Gunaratna also said he believed Mr. Sharif 's conversion was genuine .
" He has had a genuine change of heart because we are seeing a trend today in Egypt where the original members of both of the major jihadist organizations are turning , the senior members of these groups , many have gone back and been remorseful , " he said .
" He is not an exception because there is a trend .
. .
The traditional jihad movement is almost coming to an end .
What has it accomplished in more than 25 years ? "
Two spokesmen for American government agencies yesterday declined to comment on this story .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The deputy intelligence chief tried Thursday to squash any suggestion that the newly released assessment on Iran 's nuclear weapons program indicates Iran is less of a threat .
President Bush tells reporters Tuesday that Iran still poses a threat to the world .
At a hearing before a House intelligence subcommittee , Donald Kerr defended the conclusions of the National Intelligence Estimate -- which said Iran stopped work on a nuclear weapon in 2003 -- but at the same time insisted that the NIE " did not in any way suggest that Iran was benign for the future . "
He said Iranians continue work on what he called the " most important component " of any future program , a civilian uranium enrichment plant .
Both intelligence officials and nuclear weapons experts have said producing fissile material such as highly enriched uranium is the most difficult aspect of creating a nuclear weapon .
Kerr also said Iran continues to develop a medium ballistic missile , which could be used as the delivery system for nuclear weapons .
Rep. Todd Tiahrt , R - Kansas , expressing concern about the Iranian threat to the United States , questioned Kerr about whether the intelligence community has a " clear signal " of what Iran is up to .
He said there are " mixed signals , " arguing that the NIE 's conclusion that the Iranians " have n't been doing anything since 2003 " regarding a nuclear weapon program does n't match the words and actions of the Iranian government .
But Kerr said the latest report " is probably one of the most well - sourced NIEs that has ever been written , " pointing out that more than 1,000 source notes are contained in the document .

Is the RIAA as we know it about to disappear ?
As rumors continue to swirl that EMI will pull its funding from music trade groups like the RIAA and IFPI , an IFPI spokesman tells
Ars that the group is in the middle of a major internal review of its operations .
That review will include a look at the " structure and operation of the organisation and its relationship with the national groups , with a view to finding greater efficiencies and cutting costs , " we 're told .
That leaves open the possibility that the review could lead to a merger of the IFPI and RIAA , which is the largest ( and most expensive ) of the " national groups . "
If that happens , the " RIAA " might disappear even as its work continues .
The comments from the IFPI fit with a new story in Variety which claims that EMI will pull funding from the trade groups by March 31 unless major changes are made .
Consolidating the two groups appears to be one of the options on the table .
Losing one of its four pillars would come as a huge blow to both the IFPI and the RIAA , and the review now in progress is an attempt to retool the trade groups ' missions to better serve the record labels that fund most of their operations .
End Money to IFPI ?
Major label music has had a hard time of it the last few years ; even as the labels have moved plenty of music ( due in large part to the growth of digital downloads ) , more lucrative CD sales have plummeted .
The IFPI admits that its internal review is prompted in large part " by falling industry revenues resulting from the decline in global music sales . "
While EMI 's threat to pull its funding might seem like a cost - cutting measure , Variety 's source claims that is n't the case at all .
Rather , " Functions and structure need to make sense to all major labels .
Right now , funding them does n't make sense . "
EMI has been unhappy with the trade groups ' work for some time .
Back in November , we noted that EMI was considering a major cut to its funding of industry trade groups .
EMI , the smallest of the four major labels , was recently purchased by a private equity fund that is looking to reinvigorate the label and cut expenses .
EMI was the first of the majors to drop DRM at iTunes and Amazon , moves that have made its digital music a more attractive option .
But if EMI can force a restructuring of the IFPI and RIAA , the impact could be just as significant for the industry .

When U.S. author Iris Chang wrote
The Rape of Nanking in 1997 , she lifted a cloak of silence from one of the most violent events in modern history .
On a bitterly cold day in December 1937 , Chang reported , more than 300,000 Chinese civilians in Nanking were slaughtered by Japanese troops .
Canadian filmmakers Anne Pick and Bill Spahic continue the story with their new docudrama , Iris Chang : The Rape of Nanking , coproduced by the Association for Learning & Preserving the History of WWII in Asia ( ALPHA ) .
From their Toronto home , Pick and Spahic told the Straight that they first heard about the event from their son , Matt , who was working on a school project .
" Everybody else was doing the Jewish Holocaust , " Spahic said , " and he said , ' I 'm doing the one in Nanking , on China . ' "
Intrigued by the subject matter , Spahic and his wife read Chang 's book .
It was the most incredible story they 'd never heard about World War II : mass civilian slaughter , an international conspiracy of silence , and an unlikely cast of heroes that included a Nazi humanitarian who risked his life to save hundreds of Chinese during the war .
Why had they never heard of it before ?
When Chang was growing up in Champaign - Urbana , Illinois , there were n't any major works in English on the subject .
She 'd heard vivid accounts on the invasion from her parents who were in Nanking at the time , but the event was a minor footnote in a history of war dominated by attacks on Hiroshima and Pearl Harbor .
Despite a massive number of photos , film footage , and news articles in at least four different languages ( from sources such as The New York Times ) , the narratives remained free - floating and scattered , leaving many uncertain if the event had actually happened .
Chang 's book provided valuable reference points .
Most importantly , the book 's American success gave legitimacy to the Chinese victims whose stories had been dismissed by the Japanese government .
Over 14 months , Pick and Spahic travelled to China , Japan , the U.S. , and Germany to gather footage for their film .
" It 's like it happened yesterday for them , " says Pick .
Her crew interviewed the Nanking survivors during the month of December , the same month that Japanese troops entered their city .
" You could see the breath on their faces , and the memories were coming back to them . "
With grainy wartime images , interviews with survivors , and excerpts from diaries , the film traces the young author ( portrayed at times by Vancouver actor Olivia Cheng ) on her life 's journey , alongside the story of Nanking : from Chang 's arrival in Nanking and the book 's publication , to the clinical depression that culminated in the author 's suicide on November 9 , 2004 .
Beautiful and outspoken , Chang became an icon who balanced a sharp intellect with fiery passion in advocating for human rights .
Watching clips of her on Nightline and Good Morning America , it 's difficult to imagine that the young writer who gave a voice to millions would silence her own .
As the film 's interviews with Chang 's close friends and family reveal , her research on the war took a psychological toll from which she never recovered .
" It 's really shaken my fundamental belief that humans are basically good at heart , " recalls Chang in an interview in the docudrama .
She was deeply disturbed that the Japanese soldiers who had terrorized Nanking were mostly ordinary men , driven by nationalist indoctrination .
Equally perturbing was the cruel aftermath of those who lived through the invasion : survivors existed in dark , cramped rooms , crippled by traumatic memories and health problems .
John Rabe , the German Nazi who organized a two - mile safety zone in Nanking to protect the Chinese from the massacre , endured poverty and ostracism after returning to postwar Germany .
Wilhelmina " Minnie " Vautrin , a missionary who saved hundreds of Chinese women by keeping them in this demilitarized zone , killed herself after returning to the United States .
Chang 's parents , Shau - Jin and Ying Ying Chang , speaking to the Straight from their San Jose home , expressed their excitement about the film about their daughter 's work .
They said that Chang tried unsuccessfully for many years to commit her story on Nanking to film .
" The movie industry in the U.S. is not like the book industry , " Ying Ying pointed out .
" The topic at the time was too sensitive . "
They , in addition to Pick and Spahic , plan to attend a Vancouver screening .
The filmmakers hope their documdrama will not just revitalize discussions on Nanking , but encourage people to speak out against war atrocities that continue today .
" [ Nanking ] has happened again , and it will happen again , " says Spahic .
As Chang ( played by Cheng ) wearily asks in the documentary , " The voices are different , the language is different , but the story is the same ” ¦when will the madness end ? "
Five Vancouver screenings at the Ridge will raise funds for The Peace & Reconciliation Study Tour for Canadian Teachers ( 2008 ) .

Iris Chang : The Rape of Nanking official site
In response to a blog post by lynx on natural rights , as well as comments made on my post [ digg - reddit - me ] about whether or not terrorists have rights , and another post of mine that discussed torture , comments made by Andrew K at essembly.com , and in various reddit discussions :
A few definitions
freedom – the ability to act without restraint ; referring to politics : the right of self - determination as an expression of the individual will .
( see footnote 1 )
society – a collection of individual beings who together form a community with a shared culture and a shared set of rules or laws .
a rule or law – a restriction on the freedom of an individual or institution .
radical – someone who rejects the way things are in favor of revolutionary change .
Absolute freedom
Based on these definitions , it is clear that any society is , by it ’s nature , the result of the compromise of individual freedom .
Absolute freedom is a state enjoyed only by tyrants .
In a society of equals or near - equals , the freedom that is enjoyed is the result the compromise of each individual ’s absolute freedom .
These compromises are memorialized in laws , constitutions , rules , mores , ethical principles , and customs among other means .
They are enforced through various methods – from social pressure to the courts of law .
As with every human endeavor , the system of compromises that allows society to exist is deeply flawed .
Rules are unequally applied ; mores are arbitrary ; laws are broken .
But even in the purest theoretical state , absolute individual freedom is impossible in a free society .
The American experiment
What we are left with then is disarmingly simple : we must try to figure out what is the best compromise of individual freedoms that will allow us to live together in a society .
The dream of greater freedom , of a more free society , has motivated people throughout history : from Gandhi to Plato , from Che Guevera to Simon Bolivar , from Alexander Hamilton to James Madison , from Robespierre to Abraham Lincoln .
As often as these experiments have been tried , they have failed .
In the name of freedom , Robespierre instituted a Reign of Terror ; Plato banished poetry and democracy ; James Madison protected slavery ; Abraham Lincoln waged a bloody civil war ; Che Guevera fought for a dictatorship .
This is what men have done in the name of freedom .
Despite these flawed individuals and their flawed conceptions of a free society , advances have been made in the past few centuries .
( See footnote 2 . )
The American Revolution established the principle that the consent of the governed is required in a free society , and that certain rights are inherent , such as life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness .
The subsequent Constitution and Bill or Rights established a government that for the first time , attempted to balance power sufficient to maintain a stable society with numerous checks and restrictions to limit abuses of this power .
The 14th Amendment committed the federal government to guarding and preserving the rights inherent in the founding documents .
Finally , the New Deal and subsequent programs made the state responsible for providing basic economic opportunities to its citizens and for protecting them from the excesses of capitalism .
The most important liberties in any free society are those which are essential to allow for the effective consent of the governed in creating and maintaining the policies and laws of the government .
There has been much debate about what is needed , but on the whole , most agree that this list encompasses the basics :
an independent judiciary ;
fair and transparent elections ;
a free press ;
a military subordinate to civilian authority ;
habeas corpus ;
freedom of speech ;
freedom of assembly .
Without these , a government is not able to gain the free consent of it ’s people .
At the time of the American revolution , individual liberty and the right to pursue one ’s happiness beyond these basic rights were acknowledged in theory , but violated in practice – especially at the state level .
Since then , as the government has become more powerful , regulations have been created to restrain the government more .
But government power has outstripped regulation and especially since the New Deal , these non-basic liberties have been eroding .
( See footnote 3 . )
Our society is still substantially free – even today .
There are growing defects apparent in our institutions of government ; there are many attempts – some successful – to undermine the freedom of the press , habeas corpus , the independent judiciary , and the civilian authority over the military .
Yet despite these attacks on basic liberties , and the glaring exceptions that are generally gathered together under the heading of consensual crimes , individuals in contemporary American society still have substantial freedom to pursue their happiness as long as their desires do not conflict with the rights of others .
Compromise
There is the rub .
In a society , the rights of one individual is often pitted against the rights of another .
Does the absolute freedom of speech mean I can lie about a product I am selling ; or endanger others by inciting violence ; or slander the reputation of my neighbor ?
How does the absolute freedom of religion deal with religions that seek to impose their views of ethics on all others ?
Does the freedom to assemble mean that I can gather together with 500 of my closest friends in your backyard ?
Compromise is the basis of our system of government , and the basis of our society .
A significant part of the effectiveness of terrorism is that it exploits the liberties inherent in a free society .
Terrorism is the price we pay for freedom .
But upon due consideration , and with the goal of preserving our way of life and with the consent of the people , compromises may be made in order to reduce the dangers of terrorism .
Our compromises should be in proportion to the problem : suspending habeas corpus during an insurrection is one thing ; suspending it indefinitely as a result of possible future plots is quite another .
We must zealously guard the aforementioned pillars of a free society : freedom of speech , freedom of the press , etcetera .
But we must guard them not because they are ideals which are perfect ; but because they are the pillars of a free society .
If we begin to focus on the absolute ideals and lose focus on the society in which we live , we risk going down the path of Robespierre , who in the name of liberty , fraternity , and equality became a tyrant .
Every society is the result of a particular set of compromises and is delicately balanced between anarchy and tyranny .
The problem with radicalism is that it has no patience for balance – instead , seeking to create society anew .
The desire to start again , to erase all the evils of the world with a new social compact , is a compelling idea that has seduced many .
Inevitably , it has led to tyranny as the delicate balance holding society together is disturbed .
Perhaps more than anything this was the miracle of the American Revolution – the fact that is was a non-radical revolution that never sought to remake its society .
Why I ’m angry
It is because I believe our society is not entirely corrupt and because I believe it allows genuine freedom for most of its citizens that I am so angry at the current administration .
As I have written previously and will again : I believe that the Bush administration has been fighting a war against our theoretical rights and liberties , against the system of checks and balances , and against the Constitution in the name of expanding executive power .
They refer to it as allowing greater freedom for the president to execute policy and protect national security .
A challenge to those who disagree
define freedom ( if you disagree with the definition given )
define society ( same as above )
explain why compromise is not necessary ( if you believe so )
footnotes :
1 . It has been said that this common definition of freedom is meaningless .
One argument given is that “ One might want to be able to sing with perfect pitch but for some individuals this is not possible .
This is not an infringement on one ’s freedom , it is reality . ”
This argument betrays a basic misunderstanding of the definition .
Even if freedom is “ the ability to act without restraint ” , this does not imply that freedom means getting whatever I want .
Restraint is defined as a device , rule , force , or law that acts to control or limit an individual ’s or thing ’s actions .
With some mental gymnastics , one can twist the meaning of restraint to suggest that reality is a device that limits our actions , but there are more appropriate words to convey this meaning .
2 . I focus here on American democracy not because I believe that freedom has only been developed in America , but because I only feel comfortable , in terms of my knowledge , in speaking of American history .
3 . I call them “ non-basic liberties ” because they are not required in order to have a legitimate government .
They are in many other senses very basic – the right to privacy , the right to love who one chooses , etcetera .

White House :
We 're not hyping terror fears to expand spy powers Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday October 9 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Spokeswoman : ' I have not heard ' of plan to drop DHS report to influence FISA debate As House Democrats released their plan to amend a foreign surveillance law Tuesday , the White House issued an ominous yet unspecific terror warning , setting up a possible repeat of this summer 's fight over spying , in which President Bush prevailed amid fresh fears of an al Qaeda bomb plot .
A White House reporter noted the timing of a Department of Homeland Security strategy that warned al Qaeda was stepping up its efforts to put operatives within the US .
An administration spokeswoman faced questions over whether the report was timed to coincide with Congress 's debate over surveillance .
" No , " White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said during a press briefing Tuesday , hours after Democrats released a proposal to amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
Her steadfastness did not last .
" Not that I 'm aware of , " Perino quickly clarified . "
It 's not unusual for a strategy document to be updated every five years .
...
As soon as it was finished and all the i's were dotted and the t's were crossed , we were able to get that information out to you today . "
The FISA update unveiled Tuesday was designed as a fix to a temporary measure approved just before Congress left for a month - long recess in August .
Then , as now , the White House , intelligence agencies and Republican lawmakers warned of gaps in the law that hindered America 's efforts to spy on al Qaeda , and some warned of vague threats of a bomb plot aimed at the Capitol .
( A prominent Democratic congresswoman later said such a threat was " bogus , " but lawmakers did not know that at the time . )
At Tuesday 's White House press conference , Perino was pressed for assurances that the DHS report 's release was just a " coincidence . "
" I have not heard anything otherwise , no , " she said .
" There is a FISA debate coming up .
We would have liked to end that debate in August .
...
Unfortunately Congress only gave us a six - month window so we have to take that up again . "
Furthermore , Perino said , the 62 - page report is an overal review of DHS 's strategy against terrorism and other threats , such as natural disasters , and she noted the report includes lessons from the government 's much - maligned response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 .
" It 's an appropriate time to update the document , " she said .
The DHS report incorporated a national intelligence estimate released earlier this year that warned of a continuing threat from al Qaeda .
The strategy document calls for " additional reforms " to FISA , which it says needs to be " permanently amended . "
DHS also calls for " break ( ing ) down information barriers " between federal , state and local agencies and the private sector .
One such barrier could be pending litigation against telecommunications companies alleged to have helped the National Security Agency warrantlessly wiretap Americans .
The administration has said telecom communities must have legal immunity , although Democrats have refused to include such a provision in the bill announced Tuesday .
The following video is from C - SPAN 1 , broadcast on October 9 , 2007 .
Email leaves all other communication systems far behind in terms of speed .
But the principle of the technology – forwarding coded messages over long distances – is nothing new .
It has its origins in the use of plumes of smoke , fire signals and drums , thousands of years before the start of our era .
Coded long distance communication also formed the basis of a remarkable but largely forgotten communications network that prepared the arrival of the internet : the optical telegraph .
More than 200 years ago it was already possible to send messages throughout Europe and America at the speed of an aeroplane – wireless and without need for electricity .
Every tower had a telegrapher , looking through the telescope at the previous tower in the chain .
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Throughout history , long distance communication was a matter of patience – lots of patience .
Postmen have existed longer than humans can write , but the physical transport of spoken or written messages was always limited by the speed of the messenger .
Humans or horses can maintain a speed of 5 or 6 kilometres an hour for long distances .
If they walk 10 hours a day , the transmission of a message from Paris to Antwerp would take about a week .
Postal services
Already in antiquity , post systems were designed that made use of the changing of postmen .
In these stations , the message was transferred to another runner or rider , or the horseman could change his horse .
These organised systems greatly increased the speed of the postal services .
The average speed of a galloping horse is 21 kilometres an hour , which means that the distance in time between Paris and Antwerp could be shortened to a few days .
A carrier pigeon was twice as fast , but less reliable .
Intercontinental communication was limited to the speed of shipping .
Centuries of slow long - distance communications came to an end with the arrival of the telegraph .
Most history books start this chapter with the appearance of the electrical telegraph , midway the nineteenth century .
However , they skip an important intermediate step .
Fifty years earlier ( in 1791 ) the Frenchman Claude Chappe developed the optical telegraph .
Thanks to this technology , messages could be transferred very quickly over long distances , without the need for postmen , horses , wires or electricity .
A chain of towers
The optical telegraph network consisted of a chain of towers , each placed 5 to 20 kilometres apart from each other .
On each of these towers a wooden semaphore and two telescopes were mounted ( the telescope was invented in 1600 ) .
The semaphore had two signalling arms which each could be placed in seven positions .
The wooden post itself could also be turned in 4 positions , so that 196 different positions were possible .
Every one of these arrangements corresponded with a code for a letter , a number , a word or ( a part of ) a sentence .
1,380 kilometres an hour
Every tower had a telegrapher , looking through the telescope at the previous tower in the chain .
If the semaphore on that tower was put into a certain position , the telegrapher copied that symbol on his own tower .
Next he used the telescope to look at the succeeding tower in the chain , to control if the next telegrapher had copied the symbol correctly .
In this way , messages were signed through symbol by symbol from tower to tower .
The semaphore was operated by two levers .
A telegrapher could reach a speed of 1 to 3 symbols per minute .
The technology today may sound a bit absurd , but in those times the optical telegraph was a genuine revolution .
In a few decades , continental networks were built both in Europe and the United States .
The first line was built between Paris and Lille during the French revolution , close to the frontline .
It was 230 kilometres long and consisted of 15 semaphores .
The very first message – a military victory over the Austrians – was transmitted in less than half an hour .
The transmission of 1 symbol from Paris to Lille could happen in ten minutes , which comes down to a speed of 1,380 kilometres an hour .
Faster than a modern passenger plane – this was invented only one and a half centuries later .
From Amsterdam to Venice
The technology expanded very fast .
In less than 50 years time the French built a national infrastructure with more than 530 towers and a total length of almost 5,000 kilometres .
Paris was connected to Strasbourg , Amsterdam , Toulon , Perpignan , Lyon , Turin , Milan and Venice .
At the beginning of the 19th century , it was possible to wirelessly transmit a short message from Amsterdam to Venice in one hour ’s time .
A few years before , a messenger on a horse would have needed at least a month ’s time to do the same .
The system was copied on a large scale in other countries .
Sweden developed a country - wide network , followed by parts of England and North America .
A bit later also Spain , Germany and Russia constructed a large optical telegraph infrastructure .
Most of these countries devised their own variations on the optical telegraph , using shutters instead of arms for example .
Sweden developed a system that was twice as fast , Spain built a telegraph that was windproof .
Later the optical telegraph was also put into action in shipping and rail traffic .
A real European network never really existed .
The connection between Amsterdam and Venice existed for only a short period .
When Napoleon was chased out of the Netherlands , his telegraph network was dismantled .
The Spanish , on the other hand , started too late .
Their nationwide network was only finished when the technology started to fall into disuse in other countries .
The optical telegraph network was solely used for military and national communications , individuals did not have access to it – although it was used for transmitting winning lottery numbers and stock market data .
The optical telegraph disappeared as fast as it came .
This happened with the arrival of the electrical telegraph , fifty years later .
The last optical line in France was stopped in 1853 , in Sweden the technology was used up to 1880 .
The electrical telegraph was not hindered by mist , wind , heavy rainfall or low hanging clouds , and it could also be used at night .
Moreover , the electrical telegraph was cheaper than the mechanical variant .
Another advantage was that it was much harder to intercept a message – whoever knew the code of the optical telegraph , could decipher the message .
The electrical telegraph also made intercontinental communication possible , which was impossible with the optical telegraph ( unless you made a large detour via Asia ) .
The electrical telegraph was the main means of communication for transmitting text messages over long distances for more than 100 years .
At first , electrical wires were used ; later on radio waves were used to communicate .
The first line was built in 1844 , the first transatlantic connection was put into use in 1865 .
The telegraph made use of Morse code , where dots and dashes symbolize letters and numbers .
Not the telephone , nor the railroads , nor radio or television made the telegraph obsolete .
The technology only died with the arrival of the fax and the computer networks in the second half of the 20th century .
Also in rail - traffic and shipping optical telegraphy was replaced by electronic variants , but in shipping the technology is still used in emergency situations ( by means of flags or lamps ) .
Keyboard
The electrical telegraph is the immediate predecessor of e-mail and internet .
Since the thirties , it was even possible to transmit images .
A variant equipped with a keyboard was also developed , so that the technology could be used by people without any knowledge of Morse code .
The optical as well as the electrical telegraph are both in essence the same technology as the internet and e-mail .
All these means of communication make use of code language and intermediate stations to transmit information across large distances ; the optical telegraph uses visual signs , the electrical telegraph dots and dashes , the internet ones and zeroes .
Plumes of smoke and fire signals are also telegraphic systems – in combination with a telescope they would be as efficient as an optical telegraph .
Low - tech internet
Of course , e-mail is much more efficient than the optical telegraph .
But that does not alter the fact that the low - tech predecessor of electronic mail more or less obtained the same result without wires or energy , while the internet consists of a cluster of cables and is devouring our energy resources at an ever faster pace .

Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has unveiled Facebook Ads , his company ’s plans to take on the heavyweights of online advertising .
Speaking before some of the company ’s biggest sponsors in New York , Zuckerberg said :
“ Facebook Ads represent a completely new way of advertising online .
For the last hundred years media has been pushed out to people , but now marketers are going to be a part of the conversation .
And they ’re going to do this by using the social graph in the same way our users do . ”
The company is launching Facebook Pages , a new feature for brands , local businesses , and musicians to promote themselves .
This is pretty much in - line with some speculation we caught wind of on Friday .
At launch , there are already more than 100,000 pages set to go live .
Pages will feature standard features of Facebook profiles , allowing users to add comments , write on the brand ’s wall , and post photos .
Admins for Pages will also be able to add applications to them , potentially putting them in direct competition with existing third - party apps .
These actions are of course shared throughout Facebook ’s mini-feed and News Feed features to encourage viral marketing .
As for “ Social Ads , ” the must speculated on ad network that Facebook has been reportedly building ?
They are the second piece of the puzzle , and will import data into Facebook on actions you take outside the network , such as purchasing a product or viewing a video on an external site .
eBay is one of the major partners for this part of the project ( called " Beacon " ) and will allow users to import a list of their items and share it in their feeds .
Another example is ExpoTV , who will notify your Facebook friends if you upload a video review to their site or add a product to your wish list .
Privacy settings will allow users to determine what type of data is shared .
Finally , for advertisers Facebook will be providing them with detailed data on the users they are reaching .
For example , demographics , user activity , and performance of the ads .
This probably the most innovative part of the announcement , as it gives advertisers incredible insight into their customers and their interests .
What 's missing from the announcement are how Microsoft might be involved in the ad network , and the much - rumored idea that Facebook would be using member data to display ads both within its site and on third - party publishers .
The inclusion of bands in the " Pages " concept seems in - line with the rumors about Facebook Music that we 've also heard recently .
My first take is that all of this is a little underwhelming when compared with the earlier speculation that Facebook was launching a major AdSense competitor .
The " Pages " concept does n't sound much different that the profiles bands , movies , and brands setup on MySpace , and while it will be a nice revenue generator for Facebook , it 's certainly not revolutionary .
More details and analysis certainly to follow soon .
MIAMI --
The school is not what it seems .
It sits on 30 acres of manicured land near condos and bird - watchers .
The folks at Miami Douglas MacArthur South , an alternative high school full of inner-city kids and at - risk teenagers , have a saying : Even good kids can make bad decisions .
Nobody really knows why Sean Taylor showed up one day in February .
He was like that , often leaving people guessing .
He 'd done speaking gigs at schools around the Miami area as penance for one of his own questionable decisions , but this trip was voluntary .
He was supposed to talk for an hour , and stayed for three .
And when the young NFL star who seemingly had finally figured it all out finished his spiel about staying on a straight path , at least two young men vowed to stay in school , just like Taylor .
" They were really taken by him , " says Steve Rummel , the former principal at MacArthur .
" They said , ' I 'm going to college .
I can do this .'
" He touched a lot of them . "
Eight months later , Rummel struggles to explain how a 24 - year - old man who by all accounts was trying to avoid trouble found it in his home early Monday morning , gunned down while his fiancée and 18 - month - old daughter hid under the covers .
He 's trying to figure out why Sean is gone .
Former teammates say things seemed to make sense for Taylor on the field .
Al Pereira / Getty Images
Many of the details of Taylor 's death , much like his life , remain a mystery .
Shock jocks and hair - sprayed pundits chalk it up as a cautionary tale of a thug life spiraling to a violent end .
Police say he may be the random victim of a robbery gone bad .
Taylor 's friends are left to try to fill in the holes and defend the memory of a man whose true identity , to most , reveals itself in old replay videos of bone - crushing hits .
" He did n't grow up in some neighborhood where there were drugs being sold on the streets , " says former NFL linebacker Ralph Ortega , who coached Taylor in high school .
" Sean did n't grow up stealing bicycles or running around with some gang .
" He was an extremely clean - cut , well - mannered kid .
And that 's what I remember .
If there 's another truth , fine .
But I 'd like to hear it from somebody who was really there . "

The school 's Web site lists its tuition range from $ 7,000 to $ 24,000 .
It also considers itself a melting pot of youthful opportunity ( the school offers athletic scholarships ) , which is why the son of a Florida police officer , middle - class at best , could fit in with the doctors ' kids and young diplomats .
It did n't hurt that Taylor was 6 - foot - 3 , fast and feared .
Legend has it Taylor hit a kid so hard once in high school that the boy 's helmet , the face mask and the screws , fell apart .
He had gifts that Ortega , maybe biased , says eventually would have made him the standard for all NFL safeties .
Taylor led Gulliver to its first and only state championship in 2000 .
His teammates were together on a trip one night , playing NCAA Football on their PlayStations , when one of them said , " Hey man , someday you 're going to be on this game . "
Taylor , modestly embarrassed , told the kid to shut up .
" He was n't cocky , you know , that was n't him , " says former Gulliver teammate Greg Bellamy .
" You were drawn to a good vibe .
" He 's very charismatic , " Bellamy says , still referring to his friend in the present tense .
" Very easy to be liked . "
His life was a series of contradictions .
Maybe Taylor liked it that way .
He was tough and intimidating and could level 200 - pound receivers on the football field , but when he went water - skiing with his more privileged friends , he was afraid of the seaweed .
He giggled with his buddies about girls , but met Jackie Garcia in high school , took her to the prom , and their relationship endured three years at the University of Miami and 3 ½ seasons in the NFL .
And unlike many tough - luck stories of south Florida athletes who struggle to get out , Taylor seemingly had stability in his home , with a father who is the Florida City police chief .
They gathered at his house at 5 in the morning in high school , a handful of bleary - eyed teenage football players , because Taylor 's dad promised he could make them better .
He ran them up and down the streets of south Miami , their arms stretching to touch the back of a basketball hoop .
One Gulliver alumnus credits the elder Taylor with helping him get a football scholarship by showing him how to shave a few tenths of a second off his 40 - yard dash through hard work .
When reporters camped out at Pedro Taylor 's house this week , scrounging for a sound bite or a morsel of an answer , the Gulliver boys at first did n't know who they were talking about .
They always knew Taylor 's dad as " Pete . "
Pedro Taylor 's calming , half - smiling face is shown on the Florida City Police Department Web site , on top of a " Message from the Chief . "
It says his staff is dedicated to making Florida City the safest play to work and live .
" In public , he 's remarkably strong , " says family friend Mark Sinnreich .
" He 's a deeply religious man .
He thinks God and Jesus have a bigger plan for Sean . "
No , Sean Taylor did not grow up in the ghetto .
But he did n't have to wander far to find trouble .
It was just a few miles away in West Perrine , an impoverished area in the Village of Palmetto Bay where broken glass and stray shopping carts litter the streets and worn - out rags hang on clotheslines .
There are varied opinions about the exact time when Taylor 's reputation plummeted from hardworking son to just another troubled athlete from Miami .
He was known to occasionally spit on his opponent , but friends say Taylor did it because he was taught in youth football that paybacks were mandatory .
He was quiet and distrustful of the media , but that did n't necessarily sully his image .
Hanging out in West Perrine did .
Taylor was a celebrity , a first - round draft pick for the Washington Redskins and an $ 18 million man .
One day in 2005 he parked a pair of brand - new all - terrain vehicles in front of a friend 's house in a sketchy neighborhood .
They were stolen , and Taylor lost his cool .
An ensuing confrontation with a group of young men boiled over to guns and threats , and Taylor 's SUV was sprayed with bullets .
He eventually faced three aggravated assault charges and the possibility of more than 40 years in prison .
The case was high on drama -- prosecutor Michael Grieco resigned after Taylor 's lawyers said he was using the fame to promote his side gig as a nightclub DJ -- but low on punishment .
Taylor pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge and was given 18 months probation .
He agreed to speak to 10 schools on the importance of education and donated money to each institution .
He stayed away from guns .
His only mode of protection in the late - night hours on Sunday was a machete that he kept under his bed .
His former lawyer , Richard Sharpstein , still maintains that Taylor was a victim in the case .
But what was a man who seemingly had it all doing in West Perrine ?
A friend who declined to be named says Taylor spent his first couple of years in the NFL trying to shake hangers - on from his childhood .
He described them as people who were n't necessarily friends but wanted to hang around with an NFL star for his fame and money .
In an interview with reporters in Arizona this week , Cardinals cornerback Antrel Rolle , a friend of Taylor 's since they were 6 years old , said some former friends were out to get Taylor , who was trying to live a more stable life by focusing on his girlfriend and daughter .
" ... I know he lived his life pretty much scared every day of his life when he was down in Miami because those people were targeting him , " Rolle said .
Roughly a year ago , Sharpstein had a conversation with Taylor about getting out .
He was settling in as one of the Redskins ' marquee players and had an in - season home in Ashburn , Va .
Why could n't he just take Jackie and the baby and move to D.C. ?
" But he loved Miami , " Sharpstein says .
" I do n't think I ever had a serious , ' You must move from Miami , Sean , ' talk .
It was just sort of like , ' Stay out of the old neighborhoods and do n't let people set you up , ' stuff like that .
' You 're going to be taken advantage of because you 're rich and people are jealous of you . ' "
In the middle of the 2006 season , Taylor did move .
He quietly packed his belongings and retreated from a rowdy , young end of the Redskins ' locker room to a spot next to Renaldo Wynn 's stall .
Taylor never really told Wynn why he did it .
Taylor moved his locker to be closer to Renaldo Wynn -- an act Wynn says his teammate never fully explained .

His new locker was in the middle of hard - core veterans , God-fearing men with scars and wisdom about the ways of the NFL .
Wynn was considered a clubhouse leader , a defensive end with a wife and kids and a mother who was a schoolteacher for more than 30 years .
When Taylor parked in their end of the locker room , Wynn made a joke about how he was moving from the ghetto to the other side of town .
" Hey man , just needed a change , " was all Taylor said .
He was always doing things that even his teammates did n't understand .
Like the time he got up and walked out of the rookie symposium early , drawing a $ 25,000 fine .
Outside , maybe Sean Taylor did n't make sense .
But on the football field , everything did .
In these days of last memories and unanswered questions , friends flash back to Taylor on the football field before practice , in the cold rain , smiling .
He never complained , they say .
He was just happy to be in the one place he could be under a helmet and reveal himself .
" He was radiant , you know ? " says Redskins offensive coordinator Al Saunders .
" One of those really popular guys you loved to be around .
So positive , so energetic .
You enjoy coaching when you have an opportunity to be around someone like that .
They make the game , make the day , so enjoyable . "
Wynn , who is with the Saints now , finds comfort in the laughs .
He thinks about the time Taylor was ejected in the playoffs for spitting and stewed in the locker room , where Wynn 's mother was waiting while her son was being worked on by the trainers .
She doted over Taylor , who was about to explode .
She said , " Baby , it 's going to be OK . "
For months after that , Taylor would ask Wynn how his mom was doing .
" I think he got it when a lot of guys do n't get it , " Wynn says .
" You could definitely notice the change .
It was quite extreme .
He always talked about his daughter .
He always talked about stuff that was just about life .
He 'd say , ' I 'm like a sponge trying to suck up as much wisdom as I can . ' "
They met at Gulliver Prep on Wednesday morning , old friends and young faces , to say goodbye to Taylor .
Bellamy , a hulking former lineman who 's now an assistant coach at Gulliver , rocked back and forth as tried to maintain his composure and sum up a man who was ultimately not what he seemed .
Sometime Monday , Bellamy 's mom called to tell him Taylor 's house had been broken into .
Bellamy assumed his friend was n't home because of football .
But Taylor did n't make it to the game at Tampa Bay because of a knee injury .
They 'd see Taylor pop in occasionally at Gulliver to visit , and when he'd leave , young men would ask Bellamy what they needed to do to be the next Sean Taylor .
That , he can answer .
But like everybody else , he 's haunted with questions .
" I was kind of wanting to have a conversation with him , " Bellamy says .
" I did n't get to tell him how much the kids really look forward to him coming down .
That 's the one thing I kind of regret .
" I wish I would 've known he was in town . "

It ’s midnight and I ’m shimmying in front of a coked up sniper named Jim .
Moments like these it ’s good to stop and ask yourself , “ self , is this really what you want to be doing ? ”
I learned to talk to myself that way in college statistics and I ’ve never stopped .
“ You ’ll see , ” Jim says .
“ You ’ll fucking see me on TV after we pull this off . ”
“ I do n’t have a teevee , hon . ”
He does n’t hear me .
I do n’t leave .
There is no place else to learn this , to understand why people are willing and excited to get in airplanes and go to other countries and kill people at the drop of an order .
My red dress , the Dorothy dress , has fallen to the floor .
I kick it up to my hand behind me as I lean forward and squeeze my boobs together in his face .
“ Have you ever seen the movie Sniper ? ”
“ No . ” I do n’t watch scary movies .
They scare me .
“ Man , I can kill a guy from 300 yards .
It ’s , it ’s like , it ’s better than sex . ”
“ Really ? ”
Here I ’m trying to use sexuality to cure them of this killing disease , and the killing is better than sex .
I grin , Â always the crazy saloon girl , “ honey , you must ’ve had some shitty sex . ”
“ No . No .
Shooting people makes me hard , and when I can see their faces I cum when I pull the trigger . ”
I turn and shake my ass in his face .
This is where I get lost with these guys .
My college education clouds my thinking .
Do I turn around and unleash my fury , or do I do something more subtle ?
Sometimes I resent the hell out of all that Rogerian acceptance that ’s been drilled into me .
I turn around .
“ Is it the distance , do you think ? ”
“ Yeah , man , it ’s like I ’m so far away and BOOM I just kill them . ”
“ Would it make you hard to kill me , Jim ?
If I were far away ? ” I remember once upon a time , eight lifetimes ago , a friend of mine being all coked up and drunk like this .
His wife had died of cancer the month before , and he was punching things , punching and kicking .
I sat on top of him and tried to hold him down , keep him from hurting himself .
He was stronger than me and he threw me off , but he did n’t hurt me .
I ’d known he would n’t .
JimÂ leans forward , angry .
“ Do you want to be a slave ?
Do you want to beat down into submission ? ”
He ’s shaking his finger and I ’m supposed to be scared now .
“ No . No , I do n’t . ”
“ That ’s why I kill these motherfuckers !
You ’re gonna see me on the teevee and you ’ll think I ’m a hero ! ”
It sounds like something you ’d learn in one of those theory classes .
Men try to keep you afraid so they can justify killing people for you .
You are the archetypal docile lover , the one that makes their dick almost as hard as shooting people does .
Oh , and also they ’ve got sex and violence all mixed up .
You can hear the theory a hundred times , but you do n’t really understand it until you ’ve run through these realities a few hundred times .
I ’ve had enough reality for now , though , so I excuse myself without offering him another dance .
I walk through the club and it ’s all military and defense contractors .
Weapons contractors , most of them tell me , and when I empty their pockets of sharp things before the dance they all have those magic key chains with the key codes that change every few seconds .
Important People key chains , and I wonder what kind of weapons they are keeping or building up here that require all these contractors .
The snipers are all shipping out in a couple days .
I sit at the bar to get a glass of water , and my friends boyfriend turns up at my elbow .
“ Hey , you left your phone in our couch .
Why are you sitting up here away from everyone ? ”
“ Cause I ’m tired of a bunch of coked up snipers telling me how hard it makes them to shoot people . ”
“ Really ? ”
He ’s a video game addict .
He spends hours a day pretending to be a sniper in the teevee .
“ That ’s the most awesome thing I ’ve ever heard . ”
They ’re all being brainwashed .
“ I bet it is . ”
I wander back to the dressing room and count my money .
It ’s almost closing time and I ’m three dances away from a nice , even number .
I wander up to the DJ booth and look at the dance sheet .
I ’m tied with another girl for most dances , and I have a competitive streak .
I ’m done with the military guys for the night , though , so I walk through the club carefully examining each guy until I find an old fat one with long hair .
He ’s in tourism and he ’s sweet , like a Saint Bernard without the slobber .
I do two dances for him , and then three more for one of my favorites who always shows up at the end of the night .
Back in the dressing room I ’m pulling on my jeans when Nivea jumps on me and we end up giggling on the floor , her in my lap .
She ’s homophobic when she ’s sober and all over me when she ’s drunk .
“ Are you sleeping in your van ?
Come over , we ’ll have a girly sleepover ! ”
“ I do n’t like sleeping in houses , ” I tell her .
It ’s true .
I slept in my van in a garage the other day and it was awful .
She pouts .
“ I wo n’t even molest you , I promise , we can just smoke a big bowl and have some pizza . ”
It ’s a miracle she ’s so skinny .
“ I ’m sorry , I just wanna go sleep , ” I tell her .
She pouts for a second , then bounces .
“ Can I lick your nipple ?
Please ?
Can I ? ”
“ Nope , my nipples are done for the night . ”
“ Oh .
Well will you give me a hickey ?
I have n’t had a hickey in the longest time . ”
“ Sure , I ’ll give you a hickey . ”
And I do .

Burmese military has managed to hold together
The military crackdown in Burma is a reminder that street demonstrations do not necessarily lead to success for popular uprisings .
The key factor is the destabilisation of the existing regime and if protests cannot bring that about , they become vulnerable to the kind of repression the Burmese authorities have imposed .
So far , the Burmese military has held together .
The campaign for democracy in Burma still hopes for rapid success but fears that the project will be more long - term .
In our day , we have perhaps become so used to seeing pro-democracy protestors toppling authoritarian governments that the difficulties involved can be underestimated .
A handbook for overthrowing such governments would have to include the following factors :
An opposition leadership with clear ideas around which people can rally
External pressure from key countries able to exert influence .
Experience has shown that a combination of the above is usually necessary for success .
Examples
In Eastern Europe in the late 1980s , for example , several factors came into play .
There were the protests , the communist governments were exhausted , reformers came to the fore , the Soviet Union under Mikhail Gorbachev withdrew its support and the local security forces switched sides .
However , in Uzbekistan in 2005 , protests in the city of Andijan were swiftly repressed because they did not lead to wider influences being brought to bear .
And in China in 1989 , the democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square were eventually dispersed by force because the Chinese government cracked down instead of cracking up .
In Burma , the protesters have been faced with an implacable military government .
Maybe elements of the armed forces will rebel and overthrow the old guard .
But this has not happened yet .
In the meantime , the regime has blocked off the media , including the new phenomenon of the internet , which proved instrumental in helping to mobilise opinion abroad .
External pressure , in the form of international condemnation and talk of sanctions , has not been strong enough to be decisive .
The China connection
I watched the unfolding events while on a visit to China , and it was interesting to note the approach to events in Burma there .
On satellite television , one could see the concern growing in Europe and the United States .
This emphasised the way in which the foreign policies of Western governments are influenced by non-governmental organisations , human rights groups and also celebrities .
On French television , the actress Jane Birkin was interviewed at length about Burma and the next day led a delegation to see President Nicolas Sarkozy .
In China there was none of that .
The media almost ignored the crisis in Burma .
The first 10 minutes of the nightly news concentrated , as it always does , on the comings and goings of the senior Chinese leadership , which seemed to consist mostly of making speeches .
The government in Beijing is not susceptible to influence on human rights grounds .
It has a policy of pursuing its own interests world wide ( which require the acquisition of large amounts of natural resources ) while keeping out of world crises as far as possible .
There is only one point of pressure on China - the Olympic Games being held in Beijing next year .
The Chinese government is desperate that there should be no boycott .
The Olympics are presented as the symbol of China 's " peaceful rise " , as it is called .
So China has to pay some attention to world opinion .
That has led to it calling for restraint in Burma , but not much more .
The prospect in Burma now is for another lengthy campaign for democracy of the kind that has had to be waged since the last major crackdown in 1988 .
There will always remain the hope among activists , though , that one of the other decisive factors can suddenly turn things around .

Sexualstrafrecht Fummeln verboten
Experten und Juristen sind entsetzt : Die Bundesregierung will diese Woche einen Gesetzesentwurf verabschieden , wonach auch bestimmte sexuelle Annäherungen zwischen Jugendlichen verboten werden .
Selbst " Bravo " muss bangen : Auch Aufklärungsartikel könnten künftig strafbar sein .
( CNN ) -- A 19 - year - old gunman who killed eight people and then himself Wednesday at the Westroads Mall in Omaha , Nebraska , left a suicide note , police said .
Police have identified the gunman as Robert A. Hawkins , 19 , of Nebraska .

Five other people were injured , and two of them were in critical condition , hospital officials said .
Chief Thomas Warren of the Omaha Police Department called the shooting " premeditated , " but said it " appears to be very random and without provocation . "
Surveillance cameras may have captured the shooting , Warren said .
" We 'll be here throughout the night ; it 's a very extensive crime scene , " he said .
Police identified the gunman as Robert A. Hawkins of Nebraska .
They have recovered an SKS assault rifle and the suspect 's vehicle .
Debora Maruca Kovac , Hawkins ' landlord who found the suicide note , said he wrote he was sorry for everything and did not want to be a burden to anyone any longer .
Watch landlord describe phone call from shooter »
Hawkins said in the note he loved his friends and family , but " he was a piece of s--- all his life , and now he 'll be famous , " she told CNN .
She said Hawkins was a friend of her sons and " reminded me of a lost puppy that nobody wanted . "
He came to live with her about a year and a half ago , telling her he could not stay with his own family because of " some issues with his stepmother and him . "
She described Hawkins as well - behaved , although " he had a lot of emotional problems , obviously . "
The shootings began about 1:42 p.m.
Seven people were found dead at the scene by officers arriving six minutes later ; two others , a male and a female , died after being transported to Creighton University Medical Center , said Fire Chief Robert Dahlquist .
A Creighton spokeswoman said a second female was undergoing surgery and was in critical condition Wednesday afternoon .
Three other people were taken to the University of Nebraska Medical Center .
One , a 61 - year - old man who sustained a chest wound after being shot in the armpit , underwent surgery and remained in critical condition in the intensive care unit Wednesday night , said hospital spokeswoman Maggie O'Brien .

The other two -- a 34 - year - old man who was shot in the arm , and a 55 - year - old man who fell and struck a clothing rack as he was trying to escape -- were treated and released , she said .
Maruca Kovac told CNN that Hawkins left home Wednesday about 11 a.m. , and called the house about two hours later , sounding upset .
" He just said he wanted to thank me for everything I 'd done for him ... and he was sorry , " Maruca Kovac said .
He told her he had gotten fired from his job , she said .
" I said , ' Come home and we 'll talk about it , ' " she said .
" He said , ' It 's too late . '
He said he'd left a note explaining everything . "
Witness Jennifer Kramer told CNN she heard at least 25 shots .

" He just kept firing , " she said .
She said she called 911 on her cell phone , whispering into it out of fear of being heard .
A dispatcher told her other calls had been received and help was on the way , but she said it seemed to take " a long time " for them to arrive .
" It was just so loud , and then it was silence , " she said .
" I was scared to death he'd be walking around looking for someone else . "
She said as she was being escorted out by police , she saw a man lying injured by the escalator where she had been previously .
" All of us were slightly confused because we did n't know what it was , " said mall employee Charissa Tatoon about the first burst of gunfire .
" Immediately after that , there was a series of maybe 20 to 25 more shots up on the third floor .
" I was in the women 's shoe department and there was a gentleman coming down the escalator that was very near the shoe department , and he was heard saying that he was calling 911 , and immediately after that , the shooter shot down from the third floor and shot him on the second floor . "
Warren , the police chief , said the victims included five females and three males , not including Hawkins .
" We believe there was one shooter , and one shooter only , " he said .
Maruca Kovac said she was unaware Hawkins had any guns , although she said he knew a lot about them , as did his stepfather .
" When he first came to live with us , he was in the fetal position and chewed his fingernails all the time , " she said .
But she said she thought he was improving , as he had gotten a job , a haircut and a girlfriend .
However , she said Hawkins and his girlfriend had broken up in the last couple of weeks , and he had taken it hard .
She said late Wednesday that authorities were searching her house for evidence .
" My kids are devastated , " she said .
" We 're all in shock . "
Hawkins ' former school district released a photo of a youth with glasses and long black hair .
A spokeswoman said he attended Papillon - La Vista High School until he withdrew in March 2006 .
Witnesses described chaos and frantic shoppers running away from the Von Maur store , where the shooting began just before 2 p.m .
" You 're in such shock , it 's hard to think .
I was hoping God would spare us , " said a woman who was clutching a rosary in her trembling hand after the shootings .
" We had to put up our hands and follow the police to the outside . "
Others described scenes of horror as they fled the mall .

Some shoppers and mall employees hid in clothes racks , dressing rooms and bathrooms after hearing the shots .
Most of the victims were shot inside the Von Maur store , Sgt. Teresa Negron said .

President Bush had visited Omaha Wednesday before the shooting .
" The president is deeply saddened by the shootings in Omaha , Nebraska , earlier today , " White House press secretary Dana Perino said .
" His thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families this evening .
Having just visited with so many members of the community in Omaha today , the president is confident that they will pull together to comfort one another as they deal with this terrible tragedy . "
As news of the shooting spread , people gathered outside the mall , checking on loved ones who were inside .
The shopping center will be closed until at least Thursday , police said .
The shooting was at least the fourth at a mall or shopping center so far this year , following incidents in Salt Lake City , Utah ; Kansas City , Missouri ; and Douglasville , Georgia .

Automatic Memory Management in newLISP
Lutz Mueller , 2004 - 2013 .
Last edit 2013 -11-07
ORO ( One Reference Only ) automatic memory management developed for newLISP is a fast and resources saving alternative to classic garbage collection algorithms in dynamic , interactive programming languages .
This article explains how ORO memory management works
newLISP and any other interactive language system will constantly generate new memory objects during expression evaluation .
The new memory objects are intermediate evaluation results , reassigned memory objects , or memory objects whose content was changed .
If newLISP did not delete some of the objects created , it would eventually run out of available memory .
In order to understand newLISP 's automatic memory management , it is necessary to first review the traditional methods employed by other languages .
Traditional automatic memory management ( Garbage Collection )
In most programming languages , a process registers allocated memory , and another process finds and recycles the unused parts of the allocated memory pool .
The recycling process can be triggered by some memory allocation limit or can be scheduled to happen between evaluation steps .
This form of automatic memory management is called Garbage Collection .
Traditional garbage collection schemes developed for LISP employed one of two algorithms : ¹
(1) The mark - and - sweep algorithm registers each allocated memory object .
A mark phase periodically flags each object in the allocated memory pool .
A named object ( a variable symbol ) directly or indirectly references each memory object in the system .
The sweep phase frees the memory of the marked objects when they are no longer in use .
(2) A reference - counting scheme registers each allocated memory object together with a count of references to the object .
This reference count gets incremented or decremented during expression evaluation .
Whenever an object 's reference count reaches zero , the object 's allocated memory is freed .
Over time , many elaborate garbage collection schemes have been attempted based on these principles .
The first garbage collection algorithms appeared in LISP .
The inventors of the Smalltalk language used more elaborate garbage collection schemes .
The history of Smalltalk - 80 is an exciting account of the challenges of implementing memory management in an interactive programming language ; see [ Glenn Krasner , 1983 : Smalltalk - 80 , Bits of History , Words of Advice ] .
A more recent overview of garbage collection methods can be found in [ Richard Jones , Rafael Lins , 1996 : Garbage Collection , Algorithms for Automatic Dynamic Memory Management ] .
One reference only , ( ORO ) memory management
Memory management in newLISP does not rely on a garbage collection algorithm .
Memory is not marked or reference - counted .
Instead , a decision whether to delete a newly created memory object is made right after the memory object is created .
Empirical studies of LISP have shown that most LISP cells are not shared and so can be reclaimed during the evaluation process .
Aside from some optimizations for part of the built - in functions , newLISP deletes memory new objects containing intermediate evaluation results once it reaches a higher evaluation level .
newLISP does this by pushing a reference to each created memory object onto a result stack .
When newLISP reaches a higher evaluation level , it removes the last evaluation result 's reference from the result stack and deletes the evaluation result 's memory object .
This should not be confused with one - bit reference counting .
ORO memory management does not set bits to mark objects as sticky .
newLISP follows a one reference only ( ORO ) rule .
Every memory object not referenced by a symbol is obsolete once newLISP reaches a higher evaluation level during expression evaluation .
Objects in newLISP ( excluding symbols and contexts ) are passed by value copy to other user - defined functions .
As a result , each newLISP object only requires one reference .
newLISP 's ORO rule has advantages .
It simplifies not only memory management but also other aspects of the newLISP language .
For example , while users of traditional LISP have to distinguish between equality of copied memory objects and equality of references to memory objects , newLISP users do not .
newLISP 's ORO rule forces newLISP to constantly allocate and then free LISP cells .
newLISP optimizes this process by allocating large chunks of cell memory from the host operating system .
newLISP will request LISP cells from a free cell list and then recycle those cells back into that list .
As a result , only a few CPU instructions ( pointer assignments ) are needed to unlink a free cell or to re-insert a deleted cell .
The overall effect of ORO memory management is a faster evaluation time and a smaller memory and disk footprint than traditional interpreted LISP 's can offer .
Time spent linking and unlinking memory objects is more than compensated for by the lack of processing time used in traditional garbage collection .
ORO memory management also avoids occasional processing pauses seen in languages using traditional garbage collection and the tuning of garbage collection parameters required when running memory intensive programs .
ORO memory management happens synchronous to other processing in the interpreter , which results in deterministic processing times .
In versions before 10.1.3 , newLISP employed a classic mark and sweep algorithm to free un-referenced cells under error conditions .
Starting version 10.1.3 , this has been eliminated and replaced by a proper cleanup of the result stack under error conditions .
Performance considerations with copying parameters
In theory , passing parameters to user - defined functions by value ( memory copying ) instead by reference poses a potential disadvantage when dealing with large lists , arrays or strings .
But in practice newLISP performs faster or as fast than other scripting languages and offers language facilities to pass very large memory object by reference .
Since newLISP version 9.4.5 functions can pass list , array and string type parameters as references using default functor namespace ids .
Namespaces ( called contexts in newLISP ) have very little overhead and can be used to wrap functions and data .
This allows reference passing of large memory object into user - defined functions .
Since version 10.2 FOOP ( Functional Object Oriented Programming ) in newLISP also passes the target object of a method call by reference .
But even in instances where reference passing and other optimizations are nor present , the speed of ORO memory management more than compensates for the overhead required to copy and delete objects .
Optimizations to ORO memory management ²
Since newLISP version 10.1 , all lists , arrays and strings are passed in and out of built - in functions by reference .
All built - in functions work directly on memory objects returned by reference from other built - in functions .
This has substantially reduced the need for copying and deleting memory objects and increased the speed of some built - in functions .
Now only parameters into user - defined functions and return values passed out of user - defined functions are ORO managed .
Since version 10.3.2 , newLISP checks the result stack before copying LISP cells .
This has reduced the amount of cells copied by about 83 % and has significantly increased the speed of many operations on bigger lists .
Memory and datatypes in newLISP
The memory objects of newLISP strings are allocated from and freed to the host 's OS , whenever newLISP recycles the cells from its allocated chunks of cell memory .
This means that newLISP handles cell memory more efficiently than string memory .
As a result , it is often better to use symbols rather than strings for efficient processing .
For example , when handling natural language it is more efficient to handle natural language words as individual symbols in a separated name - space , then as single strings .
The bayes - train function in newLISP uses this method .
newLISP can handle millions of symbols without degrading performance .
Programmers coming from other programming languages frequently overlook that symbols in LISP can act as more than just variables or object references .
The symbol is a useful data type in itself , which in many cases can replace the string data type .
Integer numbers and double floating - point numbers are stored directly in newLISP 's LISP cells and do not need a separate memory allocation cycle .
For efficiency during matrix operations like matrix multiplication or inversion , newLISP allocates non-cell memory objects for matrices , converts the results to LISP cells , and then frees the matrix memory objects .
newLISP allocates an array as a group of LISP cells .
The LISP cells are allocated linearly .
As a result , array indices have faster random access to the LISP cells .
Only a subset of newLISP list functions can be used on arrays .
Automatic memory management in newLISP handles arrays in a manner similar to how it handles lists .
Implementing ORO memory management
The following pseudo code illustrates the algorithm implemented in newLISP in the context of LISP expression evaluation .
Only two functions and one data structure are necessary to implement ORO memory management :
function pushResultStack ( evalationResult ) function popResultStack ( ) ; implies deleting array resultStack [ ] ; preallocated stack area
The first two functions pushResultStack and popResultStack push or pop a LISP object handle on or off a stack .
pushResultStack increases the value resultStackIndex while popResultStack decreases it .
In newLISP every object is contained in a LISP cell structure .
The object handle of that structure is simply the memory pointer to the cell structure .
The cell itself may contain pointer addresses to other memory objects like string buffers or other LISP cells linked to the original object .
Small objects like numbers are stored directly .
In this paper function popResultStack ( ) also implies that the popped object gets deleted .
The two resultStack management functions described are called by newLISP 's evaluateExpression function : ³
function evaluateExpression ( expr ) { resultStackIndexSave = resultStackIndex if typeOf ( expr ) is BOOLEAN or NUMBER or STRING return ( expr ) if typeOf ( expr ) is SYMBOL return ( symbolContents ( expr ) ) if typeOf ( expr ) is QUOTE return ( quoteContents ( expr ) ) if typeOf ( expr ) is LIST { func = evaluateExpression ( firstOf ( expr ) ) args = rest ( expr ) if typeOf ( func ) is BUILTIN_FUNCTION result = evaluateFunc( func , args ) else if typeOf ( func ) = LAMBDA_FUNCTION result = evaluateLambda ( func , args ) } } while ( resultStackIndex > resultStackIndexSave ) deleteList( popResultStack ( ) ) pushResultStack ( result ) return ( result ) }
The function evaluateExpression introduces the two variables resultStackIndexSave and resultStackIndex and a few other functions :
resultStackIndex is an index pointing to the top element in the resultStack .
The deeper the level of evaluation the higher the value of resultStackIndex .
is an index pointing to the top element in the .
The deeper the level of evaluation the higher the value of .
resultStackIndexSave serves as a temporary storage for the value of resultStackIndex upon entry of the evaluateExpression ( func , args ) function .
Before exit the resultStack is popped to the saved level of resultStackIndex .
Popping the resultStack implies deleting the memory objects pointed to by entries in the resultStack .
serves as a temporary storage for the value of upon entry of the function .
Before exit the is popped to the saved level of .
Popping the implies deleting the memory objects pointed to by entries in the . resultStack [ ] is a preallocated stack area for saving pointers to LISP cells and indexed by resultStackIndex .
is a preallocated stack area for saving pointers to LISP cells and indexed by . symbolContents ( expr ) and quoteContents ( expr ) extract contents from symbols or quote - envelope cells .
and extract contents from symbols or quote - envelope cells .
typeOf( expr ) extracts the type of an expression , which is either a BOOLEAN constant like nil or true or a NUMBER or STRING , or is a variable SYMBOL holding some contents , or a QUOTE serving as an envelope to some other LIST expression expr .
extracts the type of an expression , which is either a constant like or or a or , or is a variable holding some contents , or a serving as an envelope to some other expression .
evaluateFunc( func , args ) is the application of a built - in function to its arguments .
The built - in function is the evaluated first member of a list in expr and the arguments are the rest of the list in expr .
The function func is extracted calling evaluateExpression ( first ( expr ) ) recursively .
For example if the expression ( expr is ( foo x y ) than foo is a built - in function and x and y are the function arguments or parameters .
is the application of a built - in function to its arguments .
The built - in function is the evaluated first member of a list in and the arguments are the of the list in .
The function is extracted calling recursively .
For example if the expression ( is than is a built - in function and and are the function arguments or parameters .
evaluateLambda ( func , args ) works similar to evaluateFunc ( func , args ) , applying a user - defined function first ( expr ) to its arguments in rest ( expr ) .
In case of a user - defined function we have two types of arguments in rest ( expr ) , a list of local parameters followed by one or more body expressions evaluated in sequence .
Both , evaluateFunc( func , args ) and evaluateLambda ( func , args ) will return a newly created or copied LISP cell object , which may be any type of the above mentioned expressions .
Since version 10.0 , many built - in functions processed with evaluateFunc ( func , args ) are optimized and return references instead of a newly created or copied objects .
Except for these optimizations , result values will always be newly created LISP cell objects destined to be destroyed on the next higher evaluation level , after the current evaluateExpression ( expr ) function execution returned .
Both functions will recursively call evaluateExpression ( expr ) to evaluate their arguments .
As recursion deepens , the recursion level of the function increases .
Before evaluateExpression ( func , args ) returns , it will pop the resultStack deleting the result values from deeper level of evaluation and returned by one of the two functions , either evaluateFunc or evaluateLambda .
Any newly created result expression is destined to be destroyed later but its deletion is delayed until a higher , less deep , level of evaluation is reached .
This permits results to be used and / or copied by calling functions .
The following example shows the evaluation of a small user - defined LISP function sum - of - squares and the creation and deletion of associated memory objects :
( define ( sum - of - squares x y ) (+ (* x x ) (* y y ) ) ) ( sum - of - squares 3 4 ) => 25
sum - of - squares is a user - defined lambda - function calling to built - in functions + and * .
The following trace shows the relevant steps when defining the sum - of - squares function and when executing it with the arguments 3 and 4 .
> ( define ( sum - of - squares x y ) (+ (* x x ) (* y y ) ) ) level 0 : evaluateExpression ( ( define ( sum - of - squares x y ) (+ (* x x ) (* y y ) ) ) ) level 1 : evaluateFunc ( define < 6598 > ) level 1 : return ( ( lambda ( x y ) (+ (* x x ) (* y y ) ) ) ) → ( lambda ( x y ) (+ (* x x ) (* y y ) ) ) > ( sum - of - squares 3 4 ) level 0 : evaluateExpression ( ( sum - of - squares 3 4 ) ) level 1 : evaluateLambda ( ( lambda ( x y ) (+ (* x x ) (* y y ) ) ) , ( 3 4 ) ) level 1 : evaluateExpression ( (+ (* x x ) (* y y ) ) ) level 2 : evaluateFunc( + , ( (* x x ) (* y y ) ) ) level 2 : evaluateExpression ( (* x x ) ) level 3 : evaluateFunc( * , ( x x ) ) level 3 : pushResultStack ( 9 ) level 3 : return ( 9 ) level 2 : evaluateExpression ( (* y y ) ) level 3 : evaluateFunc( * , ( y y ) ) level 3 : pushResultStack ( 16 ) level 3 : return ( 16 ) level 2 : popResultStack ( ) → 16 level 2 : popResultStack ( ) → 9 level 2 : pushResultStack ( 25 ) level 2 : return ( 25 ) level 1 : return ( 25 ) → 25
The actual C - language implementation is optimized in some places to avoid pushing the resultStack and avoid calling evaluateExpression ( expr ) .
Only the most relevant steps are shown .
The function evaluateLambda ( func , args ) does not need to evaluate its arguments 3 and 4 because they are constants , but evaluateLambda ( func , args ) will call evaluateExpression ( expr ) twice to evaluate the two body expressions (+ (* x x ) and (+ (* x x ) .
Lines preceded by the prompt > show the command - line entry .
evaluateLambda ( func , args ) also saves the environment for the variable symbols x and y , copies parameters into local variables and restores the old environment upon exit .
These actions too involve creation and deletion of memory objects .
Details are omitted , because they are similar to methods in other dynamic languages .

LOS ANGELES  Ricky Gervais says he decided to make an 80 - minute finale to his HBO series “ Extras ” because he had a few things left to say about the wages of fame , and the people who pay them .
“ Shame on you ” is one of the printable expressions that Andy Millman , the pompous sit -com star portrayed by Mr. Gervais , lobs toward the network executives who put “ freak show ” reality series like “ Celebrity Big Brother ” on television .
But he does n’t reserve his vitriol just for the programmers .
He sprays bile toward the audience who watches the train - wreck television and the celebrities who feed the beast , having weddings sponsored by tabloid magazines and calling their publicists before they call taxis to go to rehab .
“ I ’ve always sort of deconstructed telly a little bit , ” Mr. Gervais said in a telephone interview from New York this week , where he recently finished shooting his first starring role in a feature film , “ Ghost Town . ”
“ I ’ve also been in my ‘ study of fame ’ years .
‘ The Office ’ was sort of my life ’s work , where I downloaded everything I knew about the minutiae of behavior from working in a normal job .
The last few years , I ’ve been in the media , in the middle of fame .
They say , ‘ Write about what you know . ’ ”
I ’ve written before about the increased use of street - level surveillance cameras in cities like New York , now it appears that the Federal Government is increasing the use of spy satellites over American territory :
The Bush administration has approved a plan to expand domestic access to some of the most powerful tools of 21st - century spycraft , giving law enforcement officials and others the ability to view data obtained from satellite and aircraft sensors that can see through cloud cover and even penetrate buildings and underground bunkers .
A program approved by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Department of Homeland Security will allow broader domestic use of secret overhead imagery beginning as early as this fall , with the expectation that state and local law enforcement officials will eventually be able to tap into technology once largely restricted to foreign surveillance .
Administration officials say the program will give domestic security and emergency preparedness agencies new capabilities in dealing with a range of threats , from illegal immigration and terrorism to hurricanes and forest fires .
But the program , described yesterday by the Wall Street Journal , quickly provoked opposition from civil liberties advocates , who said the government is crossing a well - established line against the use of military assets in domestic law enforcement .
Although the federal government has long permitted the use of spy - satellite imagery for certain scientific functions — such as creating topographic maps or monitoring volcanic activity — the administration ’s decision would provide domestic authorities with unprecedented access to high - resolution , real - time satellite photos .
They could also have access to much more .
A statement issued yesterday by the Department of Homeland Security said that officials envision “ more robust access ” not only to imagery but also to “ the collection , analysis and production skills and capabilities of the intelligence community . ”
The beneficiaries may include “ federal , state , local and tribal elements ” involved in emergency preparedness and response or “ enforcement of criminal and civil laws . ”
The “ tribal ” reference was to Native Americans who conduct semiautonomous law enforcement operations on reservations .
Given the seeming public acceptance of surveillance cameras in public areas , I imagine that many people wo n’t have a problem with this .
The problem , though , is that there is yet another erosion of the line between domestic law enforcement and the military first established in the Posse Comitatus Act .
As KipEsquire notes , the concept is really quite simple :
The sole purpose of a military , and of military hardware , is to protect American citizens from external threats .
Combating internal threats is the role of domestic law enforcement .
These two purveyors of government force must be kept separate to the greatest extent possible , and the government should be required to demonstrate the most urgent and desperate need before allowing that partition to be breached .
Separation of army and police is at least as important a check on oppression as are separation of church and state , co-equal branches and the federal system .
Since September 11th , the line between the army and the police has become increasingly blurred .
In some cases , this makes sense .
The idea that the FBI and CIA barely shared intelligence about known terrorist threats — which , in and of itself , was the reason that the things we did know about the 9/11 hijackers before the attacks were never acted on — is , it seems absurd .
If the CIA finds something out through foreign surveillance regarding a threat against the homeland , they should be allowed to share that information with law enforcement in hopes that the attack can be thwarted .
Turning the very hardware of the military and intelligence communities over to domestic law enforcement and , in effect , spying on the American public goes a step too far , and takes us further down the road that the Posse Comitatus Act was intended to divert us from .

Students who rely on all - nighters to bring up their grades might want to sleep on that strategy : A new survey says those who never study all night have slightly higher GPAs than those who do .
A survey of 120 students at St. Lawrence University , a small liberal arts college in northern New York , found that students who have never pulled an all - nighter have average GPAs of 3.2 , compared to 2.95 for those who have .
The study , by assistant professor of psychology Pamela Thacher , is to be included in the January issue of Behavioral Sleep Medicine .
“ It ’s not a big difference , but it ’s pretty striking , ” Thacher said .
“ I am primarily a sleep researcher and I know nobody thinks clearly at 4 in the morning .
You think you do , but you can ’t . ”
A second study by Thacher , a clinical psychologist , had “ extremely similar ” results showing lower grades among the sleep skippers .
Many college students , of course , have inadequate or irregular sleep , for reasons ranging from excessive caffeine to poor time management .
Prav Chatani , a St. Lawrence sophomore who was n’t involved in either study , said the findings made sense .
The neuroscience major has been pulling fewer all - nighters , but recently stayed up all night to prepare for an organic chemistry test and a neuroscience presentation , he said .
He had difficulty remembering some of the material he studied around 4 or 5 in the morning .
“ A lot of students were under the impression all - nighters were a very useful tool for accomplishing work , that caffeine intake was very useful in meeting deadlines and stuff like that , ” said Chatani , who had a 3.4 GPA last semester and does n’t expect to do too badly this semester , either .
Dr. Howard Weiss , a physician at St. Peter ’s Sleep Center in Albany , said the study results make sense .
“ Certainly that data is out there showing that short sleep duration absolutely interferes with concentration , interferes with performance on objective testing , ” he said .
Some night owls do get good grades , of course , which may be explained by circadian rhythms , Weiss said .
Circadian rhythms can be tracked through body temperature and hormonal transmissions .
Some people have different 24 - hour body clocks than others , and may do better depending on class and testing times , Weiss said .
ChloJe LaFrance , a St. Lawrence junior from Elizabethtown majoring in psychology and English , said she ’s never studied all night .
“ If I get less than six hours of sleep I just do not function at all , ” she said .
LaFrance , who has about a 3.7 GPA , said she ’s never had a situation where she could n’t get all her work done .
“ I ’m in a crunch period right now , ” she said .
“ I just find I work better when I get sleep .
I ’m actually more productive . ”
In Thacher ’s first study , 65 students said they had pulled one or more all - nighters , and 45 said they had n’t done any .
The survey was conducted in Psychology 101 classes , and included students in a variety of majors .

Detouring past the conference center , I parked in front of the old tourist trap , paid the $ 1 admission and followed a path of stenciled yellow footprints to a building out back .
Inside a cinder - block coffin lay the subject of my quest , what appeared to be the mummified remains of a woman holding a mummified child .
“ The Thing ” looked human , or maybe like pieces of human dolled up with papier - mâché .
Either way , it seemed like a fitting symbol for the complaints I ’d been hearing about Dr. Diamond : that through the wide - angle lenses of his books , people appear not as thinking agents motivated by dreams and desires , ideas and ideologies , but as pawns of their environment .
As things .
The backlash had been brewing since a symposium last year , “ Exploring Scholarly and Best - Selling Accounts of Social Collapse and Colonial Encounters , ” at a meeting of the American Anthropological Association in San Jose , Calif .
Although “ Guns , Germs and Steel ” has been celebrated as an antidote to racism 
Western civilization prevails not because of inherent superiority , but geographical luck  some anthropologists saw it as excusing the excesses of the conquerors .
If it was n’t their genes that made them do it , it was their geography .

“ Diamond in effect argues that no one is to blame , ” said Deborah B. Gewertz , an anthropologist at Amherst College .
“ The haves are not to be blamed for the condition of the have - nots . ”
Dr. Diamond anticipated this kind of reaction .
In the epilogue to “ Guns , Germs and Steel , ” he acknowledged that human will was an important pivot in the turning of history , as were freak accidents and chaotic “ butterfly effects , ” in which tiny perturbations are amplified into cataclysms .
But the accidents of geography  the availability of raw materials and crops , a hospitable climate , accessible trade routes and even the cartographical shapes of continents  step forth as prime movers .
While “ Guns , Germs , and Steel ” explored the factors contributing to a society ’s rise , “ Collapse ” tried to account for the downfalls .
Here , human agency played a more prominent role .
In case after case , Dr. Diamond described how a confluence of factors  fragile ecosystems , climatic change , hostile neighbors and , ultimately , bad decision making  cornered a society into inadvertently damaging or even destroying itself .
Continuum of pure uncertainty and certainty :
The domain of decision analysis models falls between two extreme cases .
This depends upon the degree of knowledge we have about the outcome of our actions , as shown below :
In fact , all highly man-made systems , such as , large communications networks , nuclear - powered electric - generating stations and spacecraft are full of hidden paths to failure , so numerous that we cannot think of all of them , or not able to afford the time and money required to test for and eliminate them .
Individually each of these paths is a black swan , but there are so many of them that the probability of one of them being activated is quite significant .
To make serious business decisions one is to face a future in which ignorance and uncertainty increasingly overpower knowledge , as ones planning horizon recedes into the distance .
The deficiencies about our knowledge of the future may be divided into three domains , each with rather murky boundaries :
There are a few satisfactory description of uncertainty , one of which is the concept and the algebra of probability .

Source of Errors in Decision Making :
The main sources of errors in risky decision - making problems are : false assumptions , not having an accurate estimation of the probabilities , relying on expectations , difficulties in measuring the utility function , and forecast errors .
Decision analysis is a process that allows the decision maker to select at least and at most one option from a set of possible decision alternatives .
There must be uncertainty regarding the future along with the objective of optimizing the resulting payoff ( return ) in terms of some numerical decision criterion .
The mathematical models and techniques considered in decision analysis are concerned with prescriptive theories of choice ( action ) .
This answers the question of exactly how a decision maker should behave when faced with a choice between those actions which have outcomes governed by chance , or the actions of competitors .

A decision needs a decision maker who is responsible for making decisions .
This decision maker has a number of alternatives and must choose one of them .
The objective of the decision - maker is to choose the best alternative .
When this decision has been made , events that the decision - maker has no control over may have occurred .
Each combination of alternatives , followed by an event happening , leads to an outcome with some measurable value .
Managers make decisions in complex situations .
Decision tree and payoff matrices illustrate these situations and add structure to the decision problems .
Complexity in the modern world , along with information quantity , uncertainty , and risk , make it necessary to provide a rational decision making framework .
The goal of decision analysis is to give guidance , information , insight , and structure to the decision - making process in order to make better , more ' rational ' decisions .
There are two additional quantitative comparisons .
The first is the direct comparison of the weighted utility for two alternatives on all of the objectives .
The second is the comparison of all of the alternatives on any two selected objectives which shows the Pareto optimality for those two objectives .
Once the structure and numbers are in place , the analysis can begin .
Decision analysis involves much more than computing the expected utility of each alternative .
If we stopped there , decision makers would not gain much insight .
We have to examine the sensitivity of the outcomes , weighted utility for key probabilities , and the weight and risk preference parameters .
As part of the sensitivity analysis , we can calculate the value of perfect information for uncertainties that have been carefully modeled .
Humans can understand , compare , and manipulate numbers .
Therefore , in order to create a decision analysis model , it is necessary to create the model structure and assign probabilities and values to fill the model for computation .
This includes the values for probabilities , the value functions for evaluating alternatives , the value weights for measuring the trade - off objectives , and the risk preference .

Fortunately the probabilistic and statistical methods for analysis and decision making under uncertainty are more numerous and powerful today than even before .
The computer makes possible many practical applications .
A few examples of business applications are the following :
The Decision - Making Process :
Unlike the deterministic decision - making process , in the decision making process under uncertainty the variables are often more numerous and more difficult to measure and control .
However , the steps are the same .
They are :
Making decisions is certainly the most important task of a manager and it is often a very difficult one .
This site offers a decision making procedure for solving complex problems step by step .
Considering the uncertain environment , the chance that " good decisions " are made increases with the availability of " good information . "
The chance that " good information " is available increases with the level of structuring the process of Knowledge Management .
One may ask , " What is the use of decision analysis techniques without the best available information delivered by Knowledge Management ? "
The answer is : one can not make responsible decisions until one possess enough knowledge .
However , for private decisions one may rely on , e.g. , the psychological motivations , as discusses under " Decision Making Under Pure Uncertainty " in this site .
Moreover , Knowledge Management and Decision Analysis are indeed interrelated since one influences the other , both in time , and space .
The notion of " wisdom " in the sense of practical wisdom has entered Western civilization through biblical texts .
In the Hellenic experience this kind of wisdom received a more structural character in the form of philosophy .
In this sense philosophy also reflects one of the expressions of traditional wisdom .
Knowledge is more than knowing something technical .
Knowledge needs wisdom .
Wisdom is the power to put our time and our knowledge to the proper use .
Wisdom comes with age and experience .
Wisdom is the accurate application of accurate knowledge and its key component is to knowing the limits of your knowledge .
Wisdom is about knowing how something technical can be best used to meet the needs of the decision - maker .
Wisdom , for example , creates statistical software that is useful , rather than technically brilliant .
For example , ever since the Web entered the popular consciousness , observers have noted that it puts information at your fingertips but tends to keep wisdom out of reach .
Statistical inference aims at determining whether any statistical significance can be attached that results after due allowance is made for any random variation as a source of error .
Intelligent and critical inferences cannot be made by those who do not understand the purpose , the conditions , and applicability of the various techniques for judging significance .
The above figure depicts the fact that as the exactness of a statistical model increases , the level of improvements in decision - making increases .
That 's why we need probabilistic modeling .
Probabilistic modeling arose from the need to place knowledge on a systematic evidence base .
This required a study of the laws of probability , the development of measures of data properties and relationships , and so on .
Fact becomes knowledge , when it is used in the successful completion of a decision process .
Once you have a massive amount of facts integrated as knowledge , then your mind will be superhuman in the same sense that mankind with writing is superhuman compared to mankind before writing .
The following figure illustrates the statistical thinking process based on data in constructing statistical models for decision making under uncertainties .
Data is known to be crude information and not knowledge by itself .
The sequence from data to knowledge is : from Data to Information , from Information to Facts , and finally , from Facts to Knowledge .
Data becomes information , when it becomes relevant to your decision problem .
Information becomes fact , when the data can support it .
Facts are what the data reveals .
However the decisive instrumental ( i.e. , applied ) knowledge is expressed together with some statistical degree of confidence .
Knowledge is what we know well .
Information is the communication of knowledge .
In every knowledge exchange , there is a sender and a receiver .
The sender make common what is private , does the informing , the communicating .
Information can be classified as explicit and tacit forms .
The explicit information can be explained in structured form , while tacit information is inconsistent and fuzzy to explain .
Know that data are only crude information and not knowledge by themselves .

A Possible Drawback in the Decision Analysis Approach :
You might have already noticed that the above criteria always result in selection of only one course of action .
However , in many decision problems , the decision - maker might wish to consider a combination of some actions .
For example , in the Investment problem , the investor might wish to distribute the assets among a mixture of the choices in such a way to optimize the portfolio's return .
Visit the Game Theory with Applications Web site for designing such an optimal mixed strategy .
The systematic study of decision making provides a framework for choosing courses of action in a complex , uncertain , or conflict - ridden situation .
The choices of possible actions , and the prediction of expected outcomes , derive from a logical analysis of the decision situation .
Objectives are important both in identifying problems and in evaluating alternative solutions .
Evaluating alternatives requires that a decision - makers objectives be expressed as criterion that reflects the attributes of the alternatives relevant to the choice .
This Web site presents the decision analysis process both for public and private decision making under different decision criteria , type , and quality of available information .
This Web site describes the basic elements in the analysis of decision alternatives and choice , as well as the goals and objectives that guide decision making .
In the subsequent sections , we will examine key issues related to a decision - makers preferences regarding alternatives , criteria for choice , and choice modes .
The origin of decision theory is derived from economics by using the utility function of payoffs .
It suggests that decisions be made by computing the utility and probability , the ranges of options , and also lays down strategies for good decisions :
To operate according to the canons of decision theory , we must compute the value of a certain outcome and its probabilities ; hence , determining the consequences of our choices .
Business decision making is almost always accompanied by conditions of uncertainty .
Clearly , the more information the decision maker has , the better the decision will be .
Treating decisions as if they were gambles is the basis of decision theory .
This means that we have to trade off the value of a certain outcome against its probability .
Most people often make choices out of habit or tradition , without going through the decision - making process steps systematically .
Decisions may be made under social pressure or time constraints that interfere with a careful consideration of the options and consequences .
Decisions may be influenced by one 's emotional state at the time a decision is made .
When people lack adequate information or skills , they may make less than optimal decisions .
Even when or if people have time and information , they often do a poor job of understanding the probabilities of consequences .
Even when they know the statistics ; they are more likely to rely on personal experience than information about probabilities .
The fundamental concerns of decision making are combining information about probability with information about desires and interests .
For example : how much do you want to meet her , how important is the picnic , how much is the prize worth ?
Emotions and Risky Decision : Most decision makers rely on emotions in making judgments concerning risky decisions .
Many people are afraid of the possible unwanted consequences .
However , do we need emotions in order to be able to judge whether a decision and its concomitant risks are morally acceptable .
This question has direct practical implications : should engineers , scientists and policy makers involved in developing risk regulation take the emotions of the public seriously or not ?
Even though emotions are subjective and irrational ( or a- rational ) , they should be a part of the decision making process since they show us our preferences .
Since emotions and rationality are not mutually exclusive , because in order to be practically rational , we need to have emotions .
This can lead to an alternative view about the role of emotions in risk assessment : emotions can be a normative guide in making judgments about morally acceptable risks .
It is a challenging task to compare several courses of action and then select one action to be implemented .
At times , the task may prove too challenging .
Difficulties in decision making arise through complexities in decision alternatives .
The limited information - processing capacity of a decision - maker can be strained when considering the consequences of only one course of action .
Yet , choice requires that the implications of various courses of action be visualized and compared .
In addition , unknown factors always intrude upon the problem situation and seldom are outcomes known with certainty .
Almost always , an outcome depends upon the reactions of other people who may be undecided themselves .
It is no wonder that decision - makers sometimes postpone choices for as long as possible .
Then , when they finally decide , they neglect to consider all the implications of their decision .
Difficulty in probability assessment arises from information that is scarce , vague , inconsistent , or incomplete .
A statement such as " the probability of a power outage is between 0.3 and 0.4 " is more natural and realistic than their " exact " counterpart such as " the probability of a power outage is 0.36342 . "
Decision - makers often face a severe lack of information .
Probability assessment quantifies the information gap between what is known , and what needs to be known for an optimal decision .
The probabilistic models are used for protection against adverse uncertainty , and exploitation of propitious uncertainty .
Probabilistic models are viewed as similar to that of a game ; actions are based on expected outcomes .
The center of interest moves from the deterministic to probabilistic models using subjective statistical techniques for estimation , testing , and predictions .
In probabilistic modeling , risk means uncertainty for which the probability distribution is known .
Therefore risk assessment means a study to determine the outcomes of decisions along with their probabilities .
Probabilistic Modeling is largely based on application of statistics for probability assessment of uncontrollable events ( or factors ) , as well as risk assessment of your decision .
The original idea of statistics was the collection of information about and for the State .
The word statistics is not derived from any classical Greek or Latin roots , but from the Italian word for state .
Probability has a much longer history .
Probability is derived from the verb to probe meaning to " find out " what is not too easily accessible or understandable .
The word " proof " has the same origin that provides necessary details to understand what is claimed to be true .
Uncertainty is the fact of life and business ; probability is the guide for a " good " life and successful business .
The concept of probability occupies an important place in the decision - making process , whether the problem is one faced in business , in government , in the social sciences , or just in one 's own everyday personal life .
In very few decision making situations is perfect information - all the needed facts - available .
Most decisions are made in the face of uncertainty .
Probability enters into the process by playing the role of a substitute for certainty - a substitute for complete knowledge .
As an example of deterministic versus probabilistic models , consider the past and the future :
Nothing we can do can change the past , but everything we do influences and changes the future , although the future has an element of uncertainty .
Managers are captivated much more by shaping the future than the history of the past .
In deterministic models , a good decision is judged by the outcome alone .
However , in probabilistic models , the decision - maker is concerned not only with the outcome value but also with the amount of risk each decision carries
The Dynamics of a System : A system that does not change is a static ( i.e. , deterministic ) system .
Many of the systems we are part of are dynamic systems , which are they change over time .
We refer to the way a system changes over time as the system 's behavior .
And when the system 's development follows a typical pattern we say the system has a behavior pattern .
Whether a system is static or dynamic depends on which time horizon you choose and which variables you concentrate on .
The time horizon is the time period within which you study the system .
The variables are changeable values on the system .
What is a System : Systems are formed with parts put together in a particular manner in order to pursuit an objective .
The relationship between the parts determines what the system does and how it functions as a whole .
Therefore , the relationship in a system are often more important than the individual parts .
In general , systems that are building blocks for other systems are called subsystems
Such miscommunication can be avoided if the manager works with the specialist to develop first a simple model that provides a crude but understandable analysis .
After the manager has built up confidence in this model , additional detail and sophistication can be added , perhaps progressively only a bit at a time .
This process requires an investment of time on the part of the manager and sincere interest on the part of the specialist in solving the manager 's real problem , rather than in creating and trying to explain sophisticated models .
This progressive model building is often referred to as the bootstrapping approach and is the most important factor in determining successful implementation of a decision model .
Moreover the bootstrapping approach simplifies otherwise the difficult task of model validating and verification processes .
Specialists in model building are often tempted to study a problem , and then go off in isolation to develop an elaborate mathematical model for use by the manager ( i.e. , the decision - maker ) .
Unfortunately the manager may not understand this model and may either use it blindly or reject it entirely .
The specialist may feel that the manager is too ignorant and unsophisticated to appreciate the model , while the manager may feel that the specialist lives in a dream world of unrealistic assumptions and irrelevant mathematical language .
Progressive Approach to Modeling : Modeling for decision making involves two distinct parties , one is the decision - maker and the other is the model - builder known as the analyst .
The analyst is to assist the decision - maker in his / her decision - making process .
Therefore , the analyst must be equipped with more than a set of analytical methods .
Decision analysts provide quantitative support for the decision - makers in all areas including engineers , analysts in planning offices and public agencies , project management consultants , manufacturing process planners , financial and economic analysts , experts supporting medical / technological diagnosis , and so on and on .

One " pole " on this scale is deterministic , such as the carpenter 's problem .
The opposite " pole " is pure uncertainty .
Between these two extremes are problems under risk .
The main idea here is that for any given problem , the degree of certainty varies among managers depending upon how much knowledge each one has about the same problem .
This reflects the recommendation of a different solution by each person .
Probability is an instrument used to measure the likelihood of occurrence for an event .
When you use probability to express your uncertainty , the deterministic side has a probability of 1 ( or zero ) , while the other end has a flat ( all equally probable ) probability .
For example , if you are certain of the occurrence ( or non-occurrence ) of an event , you use the probability of one ( or zero ) .
If you are uncertain , and would use the expression " I really do n't know , " the event may or may not occur with a probability of 50 % .
This is the Bayesian notion that probability assessment is always subjective .
That is , the probability always depends upon how much the decision maker knows .
If someone knows all there is to know , then the probability will diverge either to 1 or 0 .
The decision situations with flat uncertainty have the largest risk .
For simplicity , consider a case where there are only two outcomes , with one having a probability of p .
Thus , the variation in the states of nature is p ( 1 - p ) .
The largest variation occurs if we set p = 50 % , given each outcome an equal chance .
In such a case , the quality of information is at its lowest level .
Remember from your Statistics course that the quality of information and variation are inversely related .
That is , larger variation in data implies lower quality data ( i.e. information ) .
Relevant information and knowledge used to solve a decision problem sharpens our flat probability .
Useful information moves the location of a problem from the pure uncertain " pole " towards the deterministic " pole " .
Probability assessment is nothing more than the quantification of uncertainty .
In other words , quantification of uncertainty allows for the communication of uncertainty between persons .
There can be uncertainties regarding events , states of the world , beliefs , and so on .
Probability is the tool for both communicating uncertainty and managing it ( taming chance ) .
There are different types of decision models that help to analyze the different scenarios .
Depending on the amount and degree of knowledge we have , the three most widely used types are :
Decision - making under pure uncertainty
Decision - making under risk
Decision - making by buying information ( pushing the problem towards the deterministic " pole " )
In decision - making under pure uncertainty , the decision maker has absolutely no knowledge , not even about the likelihood of occurrence for any state of nature .
In such situations , the decision - maker 's behavior is purely based on his / her attitude toward the unknown .
Some of these behaviors are optimistic , pessimistic , and least regret , among others .
The most optimistic person I ever met was undoubtedly a young artist in Paris who , without a franc in his pocket , went into a swanky restaurant and ate dozens of oysters in hopes of finding a pearl to pay the bill .
Optimist :
The glass is half - full .
Pessimist :
The glass is half - empty .
Manager :
The glass is twice as large as it needs to be .
Or , as in the follwoing metaphor of a captain in a rough sea :
The pessimist complains about the wind ;
the optimist expects it to change ;
the realist adjusts the sails .
Optimists are right ; so are the pessimists .
It is up to you to choose which you will be .
The optimist sees opportunity in every problem ; the pessimist sees problem in every opportunity .
Both optimists and pessimists contribute to our society .
The optimist invents the airplane and the pessimist the parachute .
Whenever the decision maker has some knowledge regarding the states of nature , he / she may be able to assign subjective probability for the occurrence of each state of nature .
By doing so , the problem is then classified as decision making under risk .
In many cases , the decision - maker may need an expert 's judgment to sharpen his / her uncertainties with respect to the likelihood of each state of nature .
In such a case , the decision - maker may buy the expert 's relevant knowledge in order to make a better decision .
The procedure used to incorporate the expert 's advice with the decision maker 's probabilities assessment is known as the Bayesian approach .
For example , in an investment decision - making situation , one is faced with the following question :
What will the state of the economy be next year ?
Suppose we limit the possibilities to Growth ( G ) , Same ( S ) , or Decline ( D ) .
Then , a typical representation of our uncertainty could be depicted as follows :

For example , for a = 0.7 , we have
B (.7*12 ) + ( . 3*3 ) = 9.3 S ( .7*15 ) + .3*( - 2 ) = 9.9 * D ( . 7*7 ) + ( . 3*7 ) = 7
Minimize Regret : ( Savag's Opportunity Loss ) I hate regrets and therefore I have to minimize my regrets .
My decision should be made so that it is worth repeating .
I should only do those things that I feel I could happily repeat .
This reduces the chance that the outcome will make me feel regretful , or disappointed , or that it will be an unpleasant surprise .
Regret is the payoff on what would have been the best decision in the circumstances minus the payoff for the actual decision in the circumstances .
Therefore , the first step is to setup the regret table :
a) Take the largest number in each states of nature column ( say , L ) .
b ) Subtract all the numbers in that state of nature column from it ( i.e. L - Xi , j ) .
c ) Choose maximum number of each action .
d ) Choose minimum number from step ( d ) and take that action .

Limitations of Decision Making under Pure Uncertainty
Decision analysis in general assumes that the decision - maker faces a decision problem where he or she must choose at least and at most one option from a set of options .
In some cases this limitation can be overcome by formulating the decision making under uncertainty as a zero - sum two - person game .
In decision making under pure uncertainty , the decision - maker has no knowledge regarding which state of nature is " most likely " to happen .
He or she is probabilistically ignorant concerning the state of nature therefore he or she cannot be optimistic or pessimistic .
In such a case , the decision - maker invokes consideration of security .
Notice that any technique used in decision making under pure uncertainties , is appropriate only for the private life decisions .
Moreover , the public person ( i.e. , you , the manager ) has to have some knowledge of the state of nature in order to predict the probabilities of the various states of nature .
Otherwise , the decision - maker is not capable of making a reasonable and defensible decision .
You might try to use Decision Making Under Uncertainty JavaScript E-lab for checking your computation , performing numerical experimentation for a deeper understanding , and stability analysis of your decision by altering the problem 's parameters .

Decision Making Under Risk
The problem is defined and all feasible alternatives are considered .
The possible outcomes for each alternative are evaluated .
Outcomes are discussed based on their monetary payoffs or net gain in reference to assets or time .
Various uncertainties are quantified in terms of probabilities .
The quality of the optimal strategy depends upon the quality of the judgments .
The decision - maker should identify and examine the sensitivity of the optimal strategy with respect to the crucial factors .
Whenever the decision maker has some knowledge regarding the states of nature , he / she may be able to assign subjective probability estimates for the occurrence of each state .
In such cases , the problem is classified as decision making under risk .
The decision - maker is able to assign probabilities based on the occurrence of the states of nature .
The decision making under risk process is as follows :
a) Use the information you have to assign your beliefs ( called subjective probabilities ) regarding each state of the nature , p(s ) ,
b) Each action has a payoff associated with each of the states of nature X ( a , s ) ,
c ) We compute the expected payoff , also called the return ( R ) , for each action R( a ) = Sums of [ X ( a , s ) p(s ) ] ,
d ) We accept the principle that we should minimize ( or maximize ) the expected payoff ,
e ) Execute the action which minimizes ( or maximize ) R( a ) .
Expected Payoff :
The actual outcome will not equal the expected value .
What you get is not what you expect , i.e. the " Great Expectations ! "
a) For each action , multiply the probability and payoff and then ,
b) Add up the results by row ,
c ) Choose largest number and take that action .
G ( 0.4 ) MG ( 0.3 ) NC ( 0.2 ) L ( 0.1 ) Exp. Value B 0.4 ( 12 ) + 0.3 ( 8 ) + 0 .2 ( 7 ) + 0.1 ( 3 ) = 8.9 S 0.4 ( 15 ) + 0.3 ( 9 ) + 0 .2 ( 5 ) + 0.1 ( - 2 ) = 9.5* D 0 .4 ( 7 ) + 0.3 ( 7 ) + 0 .2 ( 7 ) + 0 .1 ( 7 ) = 7
The Most Probable States of Nature ( good for non-repetitive decisions )
a) Take the state of nature with the highest probability ( subjectively break any ties ) ,
b ) In that column , choose action with greatest payoff .
In our numerical example , there is a 40 % chance of growth so we must buy stocks .
Expected Opportunity Loss ( EOL ) :
a) Setup a loss payoff matrix by taking largest number in each state of nature column ( say L ) , and subtract all numbers in that column from it , L - Xij ,
b ) For each action , multiply the probability and loss then add up for each action ,
c ) Choose the action with smallest EOL .
Loss Payoff Matrix G ( 0.4 ) MG ( 0.3 ) NC ( 0.2 ) L ( 0.1 ) EOL B 0.4 ( 15 - 12 ) + 0.3 ( 9 - 8 ) + 0 .2 ( 7 - 7 ) + 0.1 ( 7-3 ) 1.9 S 0.4 ( 15 - 15 ) + 0.3 ( 9 - 9 ) + 0 .2 ( 7 - 5 ) + 0.1 ( 7+2 ) 1.3* D 0.4 ( 15 - 7 ) + 0.3 ( 9 - 7 ) + 0 .2 ( 7 - 7 ) + 0.1 ( 7-7 ) 3.8
Computation of the Expected Value of Perfect Information ( EVPI )
EVPI helps to determine the worth of an insider who possesses perfect information .
Recall that EVPI = EOL .
a) Take the maximum payoff for each state of nature ,
b ) Multiply each case by the probability for that state of nature and then add them up ,
c ) Subtract the expected payoff from the number obtained in step ( b )
G 15 ( 0.4 ) = 6.0 MG 9( 0.3 ) = 2.7 NC 7( 0.2 ) = 1.4 L 7( 0.1 ) = 0.7 + ---------- 10.8
The efficiency of the perfect information is defined as 100 [ EVPI / ( Expected Payoff ) ] %
Therefore , if the information costs more than 1.3 % of investment , do n't buy it .
For example , if you are going to invest $ 100,000 , the maximum you should pay for the information is [ 100,000 * ( 1.3 % ) ] = $ 1,300
I Know Nothing : ( the Laplace equal likelihood principle ) Every state of nature has an equal likelihood .
Since I do n't know anything about the nature , every state of nature is equally likely to occur :
a) For each state of nature , use an equal probability ( i.e. , a Flat Probability ) ,
b ) Multiply each number by the probability ,
c ) Add action rows and put the sum in the Expected Payoff column ,
d ) Choose largest number in step ( c ) and perform that action .
G MG NC L Exp. Payoff Bonds 0.25 ( 12 ) 0.25 ( 8 ) 0.25 ( 7 ) 0.25 (3 ) 7.5 * Stocks 0.25 ( 15 ) 0.25 ( 9 ) 0.25 ( 5 ) 0.25 ( - 2 ) 6.75 Deposit 0.25 ( 7 ) 0.25 ( 7 ) 0.25 ( 7 ) 0.25 (7 ) 7
A Discussion on Expected Opportunity Loss ( Expected Regret ) : Comparing a decision outcome to its alternatives appears to be an important component of decision - making .
One important factor is the emotion of regret .
This occurs when a decision outcome is compared to the outcome that would have taken place had a different decision been made .
This is in contrast to disappointment , which results from comparing one outcome to another as a result of the same decision .
Accordingly , large contrasts with counterfactual results have a disproportionate influence on decision making .
Regret results compare a decision outcome with what might have been .
Therefore , it depends upon the feedback available to decision makers as to which outcome the alternative option would have yielded .
Altering the potential for regret by manipulating uncertainty resolution reveals that the decision - making behavior that appears to be risk averse can actually be attributed to regret aversion .
There is some indication that regret may be related to the distinction between acts and omissions .
Some studies have found that regret is more intense following an action , than an omission .
For example , in one study , participants concluded that a decision maker who switched stock funds from one company to another and lost money , would feel more regret than another decision maker who decided against switching the stock funds but also lost money .
People usually assigned a higher value to an inferior outcome when it resulted from an act rather than from an omission .
Presumably , this is as a way of counteracting the regret that could have resulted from the act .

The probabilities of the states of nature represent the decision - maker 's ( e.g. manager ) degree of uncertainties and personal judgment on the occurrence of each state .
We will refer to these subjective probability assessments as ' prior ' probabilities .
The expected payoff for each action is :
A1= 0.2( 3000 ) + 0.5 ( 2000 ) + 0.3( -6000 ) = $ - 200 and A2= 0 ;
so the company chooses A2 because of the expected loss associated with A1 , and decides not to develop .
However , the manager is hesitant about this decision .
Based on " nothing ventured , nothing gained " the company is thinking about seeking help from a marketing research firm .
The marketing research firm will assess the size of the product 's market by means of a survey .
Now the manager is faced with a new decision to make ; which marketing research company should he / she consult ?
The manager has to make a decision as to how ' reliable ' the consulting firm is .
By sampling and then reviewing the past performance of the consultant , we can develop the following reliability matrix :
1. Given What Actually Happened in the Past A B C 2 .
What the Ap 0.8 0.1 0.1 Consultant Bp 0.1 0.9 0.2 Predicted Cp 0.1 0.0 0.7
All marketing research firms keep records ( i.e. , historical data ) of the performance of their past predictions .
These records are available to their clients free of charge .
To construct a reliability matrix , you must consider the marketing research firm 's performance records for similar products with high sales .
Then , find the percentage of which products the marketing research firm correctly predicted would have high sales ( A ) , medium sales ( B ) , and little ( C ) or almost no sales .
Their percentages are presented by
P( A p |A ) = 0.8 , P ( B p |A ) = 0.1 , P( C p |A ) = 0.1 ,
in the first column of the above table , respectively .
Similar analysis should be conducted to construct the remaining columns of the reliability matrix .
Note that for consistency , the entries in each column of the above reliability matrix should add up to one .
While this matrix provides the conditional probabilities such as P ( A p |A ) = 0.8 , the important information the company needs is the reverse form of these conditional probabilities .
In this example , what is the numerical value of P( A|A p ) ?
That is , what is the chance that the marketing firm predicts A is going to happen , and A actually will happen ?
This important information can be obtained by applying the Bayes Law ( from your probability and statistics course ) as follows : a )
Take probabilities and multiply them " down " in the above matrix ,
b ) Add the rows across to get the sum ,
c ) Normalize the values ( i.e. making probabilities adding up to 1 ) by dividing each column number by the sum of the row found in Step b ,
0.2 0.5 0.3 A B C SUM 02( 0.8 ) = 0.16 0.5 ( 0.1 ) = 0.05 0.3 ( 0.1 ) = 0.03 0.24 0.2 ( 0.1 ) = 0.02 0.5 ( 0.9 ) = 0.45 0.3 ( 0.2 ) = 0.06 0.53 0.2 ( 0.1 ) = 0.02 0.5 (0 ) = 0 0.3 ( 0.7 ) = 0.21 0.23 A B C ( .16/.24 ) =.667 ( .05/.24) =.208 ( .03/.24 ) =.125 ( .02/.53 ) =.038 ( 0.45/.53 ) =.849 ( .06/.53 ) =.113 ( .02/.23) =.087 ( 0/.23)=0 ( 0.21/.23 ) =.913

d)
Draw the decision tree .
Many managerial problems , such as this example , involve a sequence of decisions .
When a decision situation requires a series of decisions , the payoff table cannot accommodate the multiple layers of decision - making .
Thus , a decision tree is needed .
Do not gather useless information that cannot change a decision : A question for you :
In a game a player is presented two envelopes containing money .
He is told that one envelope contains twice as much money as the other envelope , but he does not know which one contains the larger amount .
The player then may pick one envelope at will , and after he has made a decision , he is offered to exchange his envelope with the other envelope .
If the player is allowed to see what 's inside the envelope he has selected at first , should the player swap , that is , exchange the envelopes ?
The outcome of a good decision may not be good , therefor one must not confuse the quality of the outcome with the quality of the decision .
As Seneca put it " When the words are clear , then the thought will be also " .
Decision Tree and Influence Diagram Decision Tree Approach : A decision tree is a chronological representation of the decision process .
It utilizes a network of two types of nodes : decision ( choice ) nodes ( represented by square shapes ) , and states of nature ( chance ) nodes ( represented by circles ) .
Construct a decision tree utilizing the logic of the problem .
For the chance nodes , ensure that the probabilities along any outgoing branch sum to one .
Calculate the expected payoffs by rolling the tree backward ( i.e. , starting at the right and working toward the left ) .
You may imagine driving your car ; starting at the foot of the decision tree and moving to the right along the branches .
At each square you have control , to make a decision and then turn the wheel of your car .
At each circle , Lady Fortuna takes over the wheel and you are powerless .
Here is a step - by - step description of how to build a decision tree :
Draw the decision tree using squares to represent decisions and circles to represent uncertainty , Evaluate the decision tree to make sure all possible outcomes are included , Calculate the tree values working from the right side back to the left , Calculate the values of uncertain outcome nodes by multiplying the value of the outcomes by their probability ( i.e. , expected values ) .
On the tree , the value of a node can be calculated when we have the values for all the nodes following it .
The value for a choice node is the largest value of all nodes immediately following it .
The value of a chance node is the expected value of the nodes following that node , using the probability of the arcs .
By rolling the tree backward , from its branches toward its root , you can compute the value of all nodes including the root of the tree .
Putting these numerical results on the decision tree results in the following graph :
A Typical Decision Tree

Determine the best decision for the tree by starting at its root and going forward .
Based on proceeding decision tree , our decision is as follows :
Hire the consultant , and then wait for the consultant 's report .
If the report predicts either high or medium sales , then go ahead and manufacture the product .
Otherwise , do not manufacture the product .
Check the consultant 's efficiency rate by computing the following ratio :
( Expected payoff using consultant dollars amount ) / EVPI .
Using the decision tree , the expected payoff if we hire the consultant is :
EP = 1000 - 500 = 500 ,
EVPI = .2( 3000 ) + .5 ( 2000 ) + . 3 ( 0 ) = 1600 .
Therefore , the efficiency of this consultant is : 500/1600 = 31 %
If the manager wishes to rely solely on the marketing research firm 's recommendations , then we assign flat prior probability [ as opposed to ( 0.2 , 0.5 , 0.3 ) used in our numerical example ] .
Clearly the manufacturer is concerned with measuring the risk of the above decision , based on decision tree .
Coefficient of Variation as Risk Measuring Tool and Decision Procedure : Based on the above decision , and its decision - tree , one might develop a coefficient of variation ( C.V ) risk - tree , as depicted below :
Coefficient of Variation as a Risk Measuring Tool and Decision Procedure
Click on the image to enlarge it
Notice that the above risk - tree is extracted from the decision tree , with C.V. numerical value at the nodes relevant to the recommended decision .
For example the consultant fee is already subtracted from the payoffs .
From the above risk - tree , we notice that this consulting firm is likely ( with probability 0.53 ) to recommend Bp ( a medium sales ) , and if you decide to manufacture the product then the resulting coefficient of variation is very high ( 403 % ) , compared with the other branch of the tree ( i.e. , 251 % ) .
Clearly one must not consider only one consulting firm , rather one must consider several potential consulting during decision - making planning stage .
The risk decision tree then is a necessary tool to construct for each consulting firm in order to measure and compare to arrive at the final decision for implementation .
The Impact of Prior Probability and Reliability Matrix on Your Decision :
To study how important your prior knowledge and / or the accuracy of the expected information from the consultant in your decision our numerical example , I suggest redoing the above numerical example in performing some numerical sensitivity analysis .
You may start with the following extreme and interesting cases by using this JavaScript for the needed computation :
Consider a flat prior , without changing the reliability matrix .
Consider a perfect reliability matrix ( i.e. , with an identity matrix ) , without changing the prior .
Consider a perfect prior , without changing the reliability matrix .
Consider a flat reliability matrix ( i.e. , with all equal elements ) , without changing the prior .
Consider the consultant prediction probabilities as your own prior , without changing the reliability matrix .
Influence diagrams :
As can be seen in the decision tree examples , the branch and node description of sequential decision problems often become very complicated .
At times it is downright difficult to draw the tree in such a manner that preserves the relationships that actually drive the decision .
The need to maintain validation , and the rapid increase in complexity that often arises from the liberal use of recursive structures , have rendered the decision process difficult to describe to others .
The reason for this complexity is that the actual computational mechanism used to analyze the tree , is embodied directly within the trees and branches .
The probabilities and values required to calculate the expected value of the following branch are explicitly defined at each node .

You know Jodie Foster , that actress who you 've always presumed to be a lesbian even though she 's never explicitly stated as much in public ?
Yeah , turns out she 's a lesbian .
At the Hollywood Reporter 's Women in Entertainment Power 100 breakfast earlier this week , Jodie Foster decided that the time was right to bravely step out of the closet and admit her homosexuality to the world by dedicating an award to her same - sex partner of close to two decades .
And Jodie Foster 's lesbian announcement sent ripples of shock throughout the planet , or at least throughout the one remaining partially - blind pensioner from the remotest part of rural Tajikistan who'd never been able to work out why that lovely Jodie Foster girl had avoided settling down with a nice man for so long .
People always act surprised when actors reveal their hidden homosexuality , and really there 's no reason to – hopefully by now we live in an age when we can accept that some of the people we see prancing around doing funny voices and pretending to be other people in movies with their faces caked in make - up might be a little bit on the gay side .
And yet it still takes some big stars years to admit their homosexuality .
It 's alright for Lance Bass or that bloke from Savage Garden to come out because they barely count as famous at all any more , but what if you 're a genuine star ?
Would n't being gay hurt your reputation ?
Jodie Foster does n't seem to think so , because Jodie Foster has finally decided to publicly admit her 20 - year lesbian relationship to Cydney Bernard .
True , in most people 's eyes Jodie Foster already had a bit of a lesbiany reputation , but she 's always closely guarded her private life .
Besides , after deciding to publicly support Mel Gibson after his Sugartits rant , Jodie Foster probably did n't think she had a lot to lose .
And that 's why , at the breathtakingly - titled Hollywood Reporter 's Women in Entertainment Power 100 breakfast this week – where she was the guest of honour – Jodie Foster decided to finally admit that she 's a lesbian by dedicating her award to her same - sex life partner , thanking :
" my beautiful Cydney who sticks with me through all the rotten and the bliss . "
At least we assume that Jodie Foster was thanking Cydney Bernard .
She might have been referring to the Australian city of Sydney , or Sidney Poitier , or the regionally - brewed real ale Sid's Knee , the effects of which we assume she was feeling when she signed up to star in The Brave One .
But at least now Jodie Foster has publicly confirmed that she 's a lesbian – and to a pleasantly indifferent reaction – she 'll be able to carry on as normal .
And that will be reflected in her new movie , a Panic Room - style thriller about a woman who can't stop crying because someone took her doggy - woggy away .

Microformats are everywhere .
You ca n’t shake an electronic stick these days without accidentally poking a microformat - enabled site , and many developers use microformats as a matter of course .
And why not ?
After all , why invent your own class names when you can re-use pre-defined ones that give your site extra functionality for free ?
Nevertheless , while it ’s good to know that users of tools such as Tails and Operator will derive added value from your shiny semantics , it ’s nice to be able to reuse that effort in your own code .
We ’re going to build a map of some of my favourite restaurants in Brighton .
Fitting with the principles of unobtrusive JavaScript , we ’ll start with a semantically marked up list of restaurants , then use JavaScript to add the map , look up the restaurant locations and plot them as markers .
We ’ll be using a couple of powerful tools .
The first is jQuery , a JavaScript library that is ideally suited for unobtrusive scripting .
j Query allows us to manipulate elements on the page based on their CSS selector , which makes it easy to extract information from microformats .
The second is Mapstraction , introduced here by Andrew Turner a few days ago .
We ’ll be using Google Maps in the background , but Mapstraction makes it easy to change to a different provider if we want to later .
Getting Started
We ’ll start off with a simple collection of microformatted restaurant details , representing my seven favourite restaurants in Brighton .
The full , unstyled list can be seen in restaurants - plain .
html .
Each restaurant listing looks like this :
< li class= " vcard " > < h3 > < a class= " fn org url " href = " http://www.riddleandfinns.co.uk/ "
>
Riddle & Finns</a></h3 > < div class= " adr " > < p class= " street - address " > 12 b Meeting House Lane</ p> < p >< span class=" locality " > Brighton </ span > , < abbr class=" country - name " title= " United Kingdom " >
UK </ abbr ></p> < p class= " postal - code " >BN1 1HB </ p> </div > < p >Telephone : < span class = " tel " >+44 ( 0)1273 323 008</span></p> < p>E-mail : < a href= " mailto:info@riddleandfinns.co.uk " class= " email " >info@riddleandfinns.co.uk </a></ p> </li>
Since we ’re dealing with a list of restaurants , each hCard is marked up inside a list item .
Each restaurant is an organisation ; we signify this by placing the classes fn and org on the element surrounding the restaurant ’s name ( according to the hCard spec , setting both fn and org to the same value signifies that the hCard represents an organisation rather than a person ) .
The address information itself is contained within a div of class adr .
Note that the HTML < address > element is not suitable here for two reasons : firstly , it is intended to mark up contact details for the current document rather than generic addresses ; secondly , address is an inline element and as such cannot contain the paragraphs elements used here for the address information .
A nice thing about microformats is that they provide us with automatic hooks for our styling .
For the moment we ’ll just tidy up the whitespace a bit ; for more advanced style tips consult John Allsop ’s guide from 24 ways 2006 .
.vcard p { margin : 0 ; } .adr { margin- bottom : 0.5em ; }
To plot the restaurants on a map we ’ll need latitude and longitude for each one .
We can find this out from their address using geocoding .
Most mapping APIs include support for geocoding , which means we can pass the API an address and get back a latitude / longitude point .
Mapstraction provides an abstraction layer around these APIs which can be included using the following script tag :
< script type =" text / javascript " src= " http://mapstraction.com/src/mapstraction-geocode.js "></ script>
While we ’re at it , let ’s pull in the other external scripts we ’ll be using :
< script type =" text / javascript " src=" jquery - 1.2.1.js " ></ script > < script src= "
http://maps.google.com/maps?file=api&v=2&key=YOUR_KEY " type =" text / javascript " ></ script > < script type =" text/ javascript " src= " http://mapstraction.com/src/mapstraction.js "></script> < script type =" text / javascript " src= " http://mapstraction.com/src/mapstraction-geocode.js "></ script>
That ’s everything set up : let ’s write some JavaScript !
In jQuery , almost every operation starts with a call to the jQuery function .
The function simulates method overloading to behave in different ways depending on the arguments passed to it .
When writing unobtrusive JavaScript it ’s important to set up code to execute when the page has loaded to the point that the DOM is available to be manipulated .
To do this with jQuery , pass a callback function to the jQuery function itself :
j Query ( function ( ) { //
This code will be executed when the DOM is ready } ) ;
Initialising the map
The first thing we need to do is initialise our map .
Mapstraction needs a div with an explicit width , height and ID to show it where to put the map .
Our document does n’t currently include this markup , but we can insert it with a single line of jQuery code :
j Query ( function ( ) { //
First create a div to host the map var themap = j Query ( ' < div id = " themap " ></div >') .css ( { ' width ' : ' 90 % ' , ' height ' : ' 400 px ' }).insertBefore('ul.restaurants ' ) ; } ) ;
While this is technically just a single line of JavaScript ( with line - breaks added for readability ) it ’s actually doing quite a lot of work .
Let ’s break it down in to steps :
var themap = j Query ( ' < div id = " themap " ></div > ')
Here ’s jQuery ’s method overloading in action : if you pass it a string that starts with a < it assumes that you wish to create a new HTML element .
This provides us with a handy shortcut for the more verbose DOM equivalent :
var themap = document.createElement ( ' div ' ) ; themap.id = ' themap ' ;
Next we want to apply some CSS rules to the element .
j Query supports chaining , which means we can continue to call methods on the object returned by jQuery or any of its methods :
var themap = j Query ( ' < div id = " themap " ></div >') .css ( { ' width ' : ' 90 % ' , ' height ' : ' 400 px ' })
Finally , we need to insert our new HTML element in to the page .
j Query provides a number of methods for element insertion , but in this case we want to position it directly before the < ul > we are using to contain our restaurants .
j Query ’s insertBefore ( ) method takes a CSS selector indicating an element already on the page and places the current jQuery selection directly before that element in the DOM .
var themap = j Query ( ' < div id = " themap " ></div >') .css ( { ' width ' : ' 90 % ' , ' height ' : ' 400 px ' }).insertBefore('ul.restaurants ' ) ;
Finally , we need to initialise the map itself using Mapstraction .
The Mapstraction constructor takes two arguments : the first is the ID of the element used to position the map ; the second is the mapping provider to use ( in this case google ) :
// Initialise the map var mapstraction = new Mapstraction ( ' themap ' , ' google ' ) ;
We want the map to appear centred on Brighton , so we ’ll need to know the correct co-ordinates .
We can use www.getlatlon.com to find both the co-ordinates and the initial map zoom level .
// Show map centred on Brighton mapstraction.setCenterAndZoom ( new LatLonPoint ( 50.82423734980143 , -0.14007568359375 ) , 15 // Zoom level appropriate for Brighton city centre ) ;
We also want controls on the map to allow the user to zoom in and out and toggle between map and satellite view .
mapstraction.addControls({ zoom : ' large ' , map_type : true } ) ;
Adding the markers
It ’s finally time to parse some microformats .
Since we ’re using hCard , the information we want is wrapped in elements with the class vcard .
We can use jQuery ’s CSS selector support to find them :
var vcards = j Query ( '.vcard ' ) ;
Now that we ’ve found them , we need to create a marker for each one in turn .
Rather than using a regular JavaScript for loop , we can instead use jQuery ’s each ( ) method to execute a function against each of the hCards .
jQuery('.vcard ').each ( function ( ) { //
Do something with the hCard } ) ;
Within the callback function , this is set to the current DOM element ( in our case , the list item ) .
If we want to call the magic jQuery methods on it we ’ll need to wrap it in another call to jQuery :
jQuery ('.vcard ').each ( function ( ) { var hcard = j Query ( this ) ; } ) ;
The Google maps geocoder seems to work best if you pass it the street address and a postcode .
We can extract these using CSS selectors : this time , we ’ll use jQuery ’s find ( ) method which searches within the current jQuery selection :
var streetaddress = hcard.find ('.street-address ') . text ( ) ; var postcode = hcard.find ('.postal - code ' ) . text ( ) ;
The text ( ) method extracts the text contents of the selected node , minus any HTML markup .
We ’ve got the address ; now we need to geocode it .
Mapstraction ’s geocoding API requires us to first construct a MapstractionGeocoder , then use the geocode ( ) method to pass it an address .
Here ’s the code outline :
var geocoder = new MapstractionGeocoder ( onComplete , ' google ' ) ; geocoder.geocode( {' address ' : ' the address goes here ' ) ;
The onComplete function is executed when the geocoding operation has been completed , and will be passed an object with the resulting point on the map .
We just want to create a marker for the point :
var geocoder = new MapstractionGeocoder ( function ( result ) { var marker = new Marker ( result.point ) ; mapstraction.addMarker( marker ) ; } , ' google ' ) ;
For our purposes , joining the street address and postcode with a comma to create the address should suffice :
geocoder.geocode({' address ' : streetaddress + ' , ' + postcode} ) ;
There ’s one last step : when the marker is clicked , we want to display details of the restaurant .
We can do this with an info bubble , which can be configured by passing in a string of HTML .
We ’ll construct that HTML using jQuery ’s html ( ) method on our hcard object , which extracts the HTML contained within that DOM node as a string .
var marker = new Marker ( result.point ) ; marker.setInfoBubble ( ' < div class = " bubble " >' + hcard.html( ) + '</div >' ) ; mapstraction.addMarker( marker ) ;
We ’ve wrapped the bubble in a div with class bubble to make it easier to style .
Google Maps can behave strangely if you do n’t provide an explicit width for your info bubbles , so we ’ll add that to our CSS now :
. bubble { width : 300 px ; }
That ’s everything we need : let ’s combine our code together :
j Query ( function ( ) { //
First create a div to host the map var themap = j Query ( ' < div id = " themap " ></div >') .css ( { ' width ' : ' 90 % ' , ' height ' : ' 400 px ' }).insertBefore('ul.restaurants ' ) ; //
Now initialise the map var mapstraction = new Mapstraction ( ' themap ' , ' google ' ) ; mapstraction.addControls({ zoom : ' large ' , map_type : true } ) ; //
Show map centred on Brighton mapstraction.setCenterAndZoom ( new LatLonPoint ( 50.82423734980143 , -0.14007568359375 ) , 15 // Zoom level appropriate for Brighton city centre ) ; //
Geocode each hcard and add a marker jQuery ( '.vcard ' ).each ( function ( ) { var hcard = j Query ( this ) ; var streetaddress = hcard.find ('.street-address ') . text ( ) ; var postcode = hcard.find ('.postal - code ' ) . text ( ) ; var geocoder = new MapstractionGeocoder ( function ( result ) { var marker = new Marker ( result.point ) ; marker.setInfoBubble ( ' < div class = " bubble " >' + hcard.html( ) + '</div >' ) ; mapstraction.addMarker( marker ) ; } , ' google ' ) ; geocoder.geocode({' address ' : streetaddress + ' , ' + postcode} ) ; } ) ; } ) ;
Here ’s the finished code .
There ’s one last shortcut we can add : jQuery provides the $ symbol as an alias for jQuery .
We could just go through our code and replace every call to jQuery ( ) with a call to $ ( ) , but this would cause incompatibilities if we ever attempted to use our script on a page that also includes the Prototype library .
A more robust approach is to start our code with the following :
jQuery ( function ( $ ) { //
Within this function , $ now refers to jQuery // ... } ) ;
j Query cleverly passes itself as the first argument to any function registered to the DOM ready event , which means we can assign a local $ variable shortcut without affecting the $ symbol in the global scope .
This makes it easy to use jQuery with other libraries .
Limitations of Geocoding
You may have noticed a discrepancy creep in to the last example : whereas my original list included seven restaurants , the geocoding example only shows five .
This is because the Google Maps geocoder incorporates a rate limit : more than five lookups in a second and it starts returning error messages instead of regular results .
In addition to this problem , geocoding itself is an inexact science : while UK postcodes generally get you down to the correct street , figuring out the exact point on the street from the provided address usually is n’t too accurate ( although Google do a pretty good job ) .
Finally , there ’s the performance overhead .
We ’re making five geocoding requests to Google for every page served , even though the restaurants themselves are n’t likely to change location any time soon .
Surely there ’s a better way of doing this ?
Microformats to the rescue ( again ) !
The geo microformat suggests simple classes for including latitude and longitude information in a page .
We can add specific points for each restaurant using the following markup :
< li class= " vcard " > < h3 class= " fn org " >E - Kagen </h3 > < div class= " adr " > < p class= " street - address " > 22-23 Sydney Street </ p> < p >< span class=" locality " > Brighton </ span > , < abbr class=" country - name " title= " United Kingdom " >
UK </ abbr ></p> < p class= " postal - code " >BN1 4EN </ p> </div > < p >Telephone : < span class = " tel " >+44 ( 0)1273 687 068</span></p> < p class = " geo " > Lat / Lon : < span class =" latitude " >50.827917</span > , < span class= " longitude " >- 0.137764</span > </ p> </li>
As before , I used www.getlatlon.com to find the exact locations – I find satellite view is particularly useful for locating individual buildings .
Latitudes and longitudes are great for machines but not so useful for human beings .
We could hide them entirely with display : none , but I prefer to merely de-emphasise them ( someone might want them for their GPS unit ) :
.vcard .geo { margin - top : 0.5em ; font - size : 0.85 em ; color : #ccc ; }
It ’s probably a good idea to hide them completely when they ’re displayed inside an info bubble :
. bubble .geo { display : none ; }
We can extract the co-ordinates in the same way we extracted the address .
Since we ’re no longer geocoding anything our code becomes a lot simpler :
$ ('.vcard ' ) .each ( function ( ) { var hcard = $ ( this ) ; var latitude = hcard.find ( '.geo .latitude ' ) . text ( ) ; var longitude = hcard.find ('.geo .longitude ' ) . text ( ) ; var marker = new Marker ( new LatLonPoint ( latitude , longitude ) ) ; marker.setInfoBubble ( ' < div class = " bubble " >' + hcard.html( ) + '</div >' ) ; mapstraction.addMarker( marker ) ; } ) ;
And here ’s the finished geo example .

US Public Skeptical of “ Surge , ”
72 % Disapprove of Bush ’s Handling of Iraq
It is n’t amazing that 61 % of Americans think the US should never have invaded Iraq . [- Courtesy NYT / CBS . ]
What is amazing is that 35 % still think it was a good idea .
It is n’t amazing that 76 % ( including 51 % of Republicans ) of Americans say that the increased US troop levels in Iraq have had no impact or are making things worse .
What is amazing is that 20 % think that things have gotten significantly better .
It is n’t amazing that 63 % of Americans support a timetable for US withdrawal ending in 2008 .
What is amazing is that so many do not .
It is n’t amazing that 13 % want to cut off money for the Iraq War immediately , or that 69 % want further funding to be tied to the meeting of specific benchmarks .
What is amazing is that % 15 want the war funded with no conditions at all .
( By the way , that only 13 % want to cut off all funding immediately goes a long way toward explaining the vote on the supplemental in Congress ) .
It is n’t amazing that 72 percent of Americans disapprove of Bush ’s handling of Iraq .
What is amazing is that 23 percent approve .

Given that a third of evangelicals voted Democrat in the last election , it is not impossible that the GOP will end up a minority taste for years to come .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Democratic lawmakers and staffers privately say they 're closing in on a broad budget deal that would give President Bush as much as $ 70 billion in new war funding .
Congress is likely to pass an additional $ 70 billion in new war funds , Democrats tell CNN .
The deal would lack a key provision Democrats had attached to previous funding bills calling for most U.S. troops to come home from Iraq by the end of 2008 , which would be a significant legislative victory for Bush .
Democrats admit such a move would be highly controversial within their own party .
Coming just weeks after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - California , vowed the White House would not get another dollar in war money this year , it would further antagonize the liberal base of the party , which has become frustrated with the congressional leadership 's failure to push back on Bush 's Iraq policy .
" The base will not be happy , " said one senior Democratic aide , who requested anonymity to candidly discuss budget negotiations that have not been completed .
The Democratic aide acknowledged the president is likely to get new money for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan before Congress adjourns for the year .
" Yes , in the end , that 's where we will be , " the aide said .
A senior Republican aide also said both sides are nearing a deal that would give Bush a large chunk of the $ 200 billion in war funding he requested earlier this year .
" We 're not there yet , but we 're close , " the Republican aide said .
Privately , Democrats say they have little choice but to give the president at least some war funding because Senate Republicans have vowed to block any final budget deal unless it has at least some of the war funding Bush has requested .
The White House has also been aggressive about pointing out that Defense Secretary Robert Gates will have to start laying off some civilian employees and freezing some defense contracts unless the Pentagon gets new war money soon , putting vast political pressure on Democrats to give the troops more money before going home for Christmas .
" We 're calling on Congress to fully fund the troops , " White House press secretary Dana Perino said Wednesday .
" The troops need the money .
Secretary Gates has been very clear -- since November 14 , he has said that there might have to be furlough notices that go out if we do n't get the money . "
Still , Democrats are trying to sell $ 70 billion in new war funding as a partial victory for them .
They point out that while the final numbers are still in flux during intense private negotiations , Bush is likely to get far less money than he originally requested .
" What is for sure is he will not get all $ 200 billion , " said one senior Democratic lawmaker .
" Whatever number it is , it is much less than what the president asked for .
For the first time in this war , he has received less than his request . "
But senior administration officials privately say they expect to be able to get at least of the rest of the president 's $ 200 billion request passed through Congress next year .
" They have not been able to change the president 's policy , " one senior official said flatly , expressing confidence the White House will continue to get more war funds as violence decreases in Iraq .

Following on from recent discussions on Saudi Arabian production declines , and the somewhat uncertain degree to which we might attribute them to declines in North Ghawar , I 'd now like to take up the question of what have been the consequences of these declines for global oil supply , and for US gasoline prices in particular .
We can discuss this impact regardless of the degree to which the declines have been deliberate or due to unavoidable declines in the output of some fields .
Let me start by providing the latest available data on Saudi oil production :
The core issue under discussion is that production is off by about 1 million barrels per day since Q3 of 2004 , despite the addition of new projects with a rated capacity of about 1 million barrels per day ( the Qatif / Abu Safah redevelopment which was supposed to create 690 kbd of additional crude + condensate capacity , and the Haradh III development which should have added 300 kbd of crude production capacity ) .
If we imagine that all fields had been on the same plateau as in Q3 2004 to the present day , and we further add in the new projects ( dating approximate ) , we would have had a picture like the purple curve in this next graph :
Average of five estimates of Saudi Arabian oil production , Jan 1995 - Mar 2007 , together with hypothetical scenario with no declines and where 690kbd of production were added from Qatif / Abu Safah , and 300 kbd were added from Haradh III .
Graph is not zero - scaled to better show changes .

This situation is one factor playing into the global production curve .
Total global oil supply during the economic recovery following the 2000 tech crash recession looks like this :

Source : EIA data is from International Petroleum Monthly Table 1.4 . IEA data are from IEA Oil Market Report Table 3 .
( These are " total liquids " figures - ie they include natural gas liquids , coal - to - liquids , biofuels , refinery gains , etc , in addition to crude and condensate ) .
If you believe the EIA , total global oil supply has been essentially flat for the last couple of years , despite rising prices .
If you prefer the IEA 's figures , then production has been growing but in an anomalously slow way compared to historical growth rates .
If we add onto the average of the two moving average curves above the difference between actual Saudi production and the hypothetical " no decline " scenario , we get this picture :
Two estimates of total global liquid fuel supply ( 13 month centered moving averages recursed once ) .
Also , average of the two curves , together with hypothetical scenario with no Saudi declines occurred and where 690kbd of production were added from Qatif / Abu Safah , and 300 kbd were added from Haradh III ) Jan 2002 - most recent month .

Clearly , that would have been a rather different last few years in the global oil markets .
But how much of the run up of gas prices can we attribute to this cause ?
Firstly , just how much has the price of gas gone up since 2004 ?
Evolution of US average price for regular conventional gasoline , Jan 1997 - May 12th , 2007 .
Click to enlarge .
Source : EIA retail prices .
Well , in late 2004 it was around $ 1.90 , and now it 's about $ 3.05 .
So we have around $ 1.15 of increase to explain or about a 60 % increase in the price .
The next thing to understand is that there is generally an extremely strong relationship between the price of gasoline and the price of oil :
Scattergrams of weekly gasoline prices versus oil prices from February 1991 - May 5th week , 2007 .
Oil price is Brent spot price , purple curves show gas retail price for conventional regular , green is spot price for gasoline imported to New York Harbor ( ie a wholesale price ) .
Gas prices are not inflation adjusted so R2 may be slightly overstated for weekly data ( R2 on monthly inflation adjusted series is also 95 % + however ) .
Click to enlarge .
Source : EIA retail prices , and spot prices .
The R2 of 96 % at the retail level says that 96 % of the variance of gas prices ( since 1991 ) is explained by this simple straight line model applied to oil prices .
This makes sense - refiners have to include the cost of crude in the price they charge their customers , and both they are the distributors and retailers probably begin their pricing model by tacking a fixed percentage onto whatever crude costs them .
While there is some residual effect that we can attribute to varying refinery / distributor / retailer margins - which are erratically seasonal - clearly if you know the oil price , you usually know most of what you need to know to get close to the current price of gas .
Let 's look at the time series of gas prices together with the results of the linear model above ( which just knows about the oil price , and nothing else ) :
Weekly gasoline prices ( regular conventional ) versus predicted price from linear model based on Brent oil prices from February 1991 - May 5th week , 2007 .
Data is not inflation adjusted .
Click to enlarge .
Source : EIA retail prices , and spot prices .
As you can see , although generally this model does pretty well , right now we are in an anomalous period where gas prices have gone significantly higher than oil prices alone would suggest .
Likely this is due to the refining tightness discussed elsewhere .
So on the graph above , we can attribute about $ 0.45 of the rise since late 2004 to downstream margins ( most of which is very recent and probably fairly transient till BP finishes repairs ) , but about $ 0.70 is due just to crude costs .
So then the question is whether 2 mbpd in missing Saudi oil production is enough to account for the $ 0.70 increase that can reasonably be attributed to crude , rather than refinery tightness .
Well , that 's a $ 0.70 / $ 1.90 ~ 35 % increase .
Given a gasoline price elasticity of - 0.05 during the period of interest , it would only take a 35 / 20 = 1.75 % reduction in global gasoline supplies to do the job .
Since the missing Saudi production is 2/84 = 2.4 % of global oil supply , it would appear that , had this not happened , we would have had little or none of the 35 % crude - based increase in gasoline prices since 2004 .
( Note that I 'm not arguing this is the only thing going on in world oil markets .
However , I 'm suggesting the thought experiment of keeping everything else exactly as it it occurred , and just adding back in the missing 2 mbd of Saudi production .
It appears in that hypothetical world , we would n't have had the crude oil increases that led to most of the recent gas price increases ) .
One might argue that the world could n't have refined the extra oil , had Saudi Aramco produced it ( thereby causing much larger violations of the historical relationship between oil and gasoline prices ) .
Global refinery utilization data is poor enough to make this a difficult argument to evaluate .
However , since they keep reducing their deliveries below contracted volumes to their customers , this does n't seem the likeliest explanation :
May 14 ( Bloomberg ) -- Saudi Aramco , the world 's largest state oil company , will cut Arab Light crude oil exports to Asia for the first time in at least three months as part of an overall supply reduction to the region .
The Dhahran , Saudi Arabia - based oil producer will lower shipments starting in June , said three refinery officials who received notices and asked not to be identified because of confidentiality agreements .
The producer has been reducing Arab Medium and Arab Heavy sales by between 9 percent and 10 percent of total contracted volumes .
Saudi Aramco 's supply cuts in the past few months were focused on its Arab Heavy grade that mostly yields fuel oil during processing .
Saudi Arabia is lowering exports to comply with 1.7 million - barrel - a- day production cuts agreed last year by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries .
The company has trimmed shipments below contract levels since November .
Saudi Aramco lowered exports to Asian refiners in April by an average 9 percent , and the cuts this month and in June are more than the 7 percent reduction in March shipments .
It 's the eighth month that Saudi Aramco has reduced exports to Asia .
( Note that the production declines actually began at least 12 months before the OPEC quota cut , and earlier than that if one counts the failure of the Qatif megaproject to increase top line production ) .
Finally , for the record , I do n't want to suggest that gasoline price increases are all bad .
I personally am in favor of high gas prices to promote conservation of precious remaining oil , moves to make the vehicle fleet more efficient and reduced carbon emissions .
But if you feel differently about high gas prices , you might want to pay close attention to what Saudi Arabia is doing .

Students use notes , books and each other to improve learning in the classroom .

A two - year study of college students at The Pennsylvania State University ( PSU ) proves that students learn better and develop higher - level skills by participating in cooperative ( team ) activities , compared to traditional classroom teaching methods .
Elsa Sánchez and Richard Craig , professors in the Department of Horticulture at PSU , surveyed students enrolled from 2003 - 2005 in their Plant Systematics course .
The specialized course was designed around a cooperative learning model that required students to work in teams on a variety of activities .
For example , students organized a learning fair for elementary school students , participated in hands - on laboratories and worked in randomly assigned teams for their final exam .
" We were interested in learning students ' perceptions and sharing our experiences .
We found that students liked the cooperative activities and learned from other team members .
As instructors , we found that students participated more in the lecture part of the course as team activities were completed . " , Sánchez stated .
The study has additional implications for how teachers prepare for and deliver classroom instruction .
Sánchez noted " it took more organization and planning to use cooperative activities compared to the traditional lecture method " , and added that lectures are far less conducive to facilitating higher levels of thinking than cooperative learning strategies .
Student outcomes of class participation showed an increase in several indicators of higher - level thinking , such as application of concepts and analysis and synthesis of information .
" While traditional lectures transfer knowledge , lectures are far less conducive to facilitating higher levels of thinking , such as application of concepts and analysis and synthesis of information . "
- Dr. Elsa Sánchez
Using cooperative activities also allows students to practice skills that will enhance their future careers , including communication , conflict resolution , creativity and time management .
Sánchez sees benefits of using collaborative processes that extend beyond the college classroom , noting that " students benefit from practicing real - world skills that they will need after graduation , and the industry will benefit from future employees who possess skills that promote success . "

Former CBS anchor Dan Rather : big corporations , government interfering in news
By Patrick Martin
27 September 2007
In an interview on the Larry King Show , broadcast by CNN September 20 , former CBS News anchorman Dan Rather denounced what he called “ the level of big corporate and big government interference and intimidation in news . ”
Rather was interviewed on the evening talk show after his attorneys filed a $ 70 million lawsuit against CBS , its corporate parent Viacom and several top executives for the two companies , charging them with breach of contract and destroying the newsman ’s reputation in forcing him out of CBS News in 2005 .
The suit charges that CBS and Viacom executives were responding to political pressure from right - wing activists and the Bush administration after a CBS news program , narrated by Rather , alleged that Bush received a cushy stateside position in the Air National Guard during the Vietnam War , with no risk of combat , because of his family ’s wealth and political connections .
Rather says he was told of his own ouster as CBS News anchor the day after the 2004 election that returned Bush to the White House .
He eventually left his position in May 2005 , but did not receive the slot on the “ 60 Minutes ” program he had been promised .
He eventually left CBS after 44 years and works for the HD - NET cable network .
On the interview program , Rather told King that he filed the lawsuit , nearly three years after the controversy over the Bush - Air National Guard story and two years after leaving CBS , because he learned later of significant corporate skullduggery in his firing , particular the personal role of Sumner Redstone , the billionaire owner of Viacom .
Rather said that Redstone “ was described as being enraged that a news division — this story had cost Viacom and CBS in Washington .
And he wanted Dan Rather and everybody connected with it out .
So that ’s an example of the kind of thing that a year ago that I did n’t know . ”
Asked who had caved in to the Bush administration , Rather replied , “ The ownership and management .
And , you know , what they did was they sacrificed support for independent journalism for corporate financial gain . ”
Rather defended the basic accuracy of the CBS program on Bush ’s privileged treatment in the Air National Guard , pointing out that the right - wing furor against the program was focused on the allegedly fraudulent character of documents that the CBS report itself had admitted were copies rather than originals .
“ The facts of the story , the truth of the story stands up to this day , ” he maintained .
The former CBS news anchorman explained that the Bush story was not the first instance of overt corporate - level interference in the conduct of CBS news operations .
He saw it six months earlier , when the same top officials tried to delay or prevent a broadcast on “ 60 Minutes II ” by the same team of journalists — producer Mary Mapes and Rather as reporter / narrator — on torture of Iraqi prisoners at the US military prison at Abu Ghraib .
In response to a question from King , Rather repeated his support for internationally known reporter Peter Arnett , vilified by the US military and the ultra - right and ultimately fired by CNN for a 1998 report on US use of nerve gas during the Vietnam War ( Operation Tailwind ) .
Rather dismissed the “ independent ” investigation commissioned by CBS into the Bush - Air National Guard broadcast , pointing out that those involved were securities lawyers rather than journalists , and that the co-chairman , former Pennsylvania Governor Dick Thornburgh , had been US attorney general in the administration of Bush ’s father .
This occasioned the following exchange about the CBS investigation :
RATHER : This was , in many ways , a fraud .
It was a setup .
It was designed ...
KING : A fraud ?
RATHER : Yes .
It was designed to achieve a certain result so that the corporation would be exonerated .
KING : Are you saying Dick Thornburgh , former governor of Pennsylvania , former — participated in a fraud ?
RATHER : That ’s what the record shows .
Rather then reiterated his central theme of the danger of corporate - government collaboration .
“ You ca n’t have freedom of the press if you ’re going to have large , big corporations and big government , intruding and intimidating in newsrooms , ” he said .
“ The chilling effect on investigative reporting is going to be something we do n’t want to see . ”
These comments were echoed by Mapes , the producer fired by CBS at the time of Rather ’s ouster as anchorman , in a blog on the liberal web site Huffington Post .
Mapes wrote , “ Though our story had raised entirely appropriate questions about the president ’s military record , though there had been substantiation for everything we reported , though this was an issue certainly worth discussing in wartime , all that was lost in the melee that followed .
Because of the angry conservative outcry , the corporation we worked for chose to walk away from an uncomfortable controversy rather than stick up for its reporters . ”
“ In a democracy , journalism cannot fear bullies or pull its punches because somebody powerful might get uncomfortable , ” she continued .
“ But I ’m afraid this entire episode just encapsulates what has happened to journalism in general in this country .
It has become corporatized , trivialized and castrated . ”
Mapes noted that by filing a lawsuit , Rather would obtain “ that delicious power of discovery .
Who knows what that might shake loose ? ”
Rather ’s suit , and his public defense of his journalistic record , has provoked anger not merely in ultra - right circles , but among much of the liberal media establishment , with columns and blogs suggesting that the former CBS anchorman has lost his mind as well as his integrity .
What shocks and outrages them , however , is Rather ’s bluntness in pointing to the nexus of corporate - government collaboration to manage the news and suppress critical reporting .
The 75 - year - old Rather represents , not a heyday of objective and critical journalism , but at least an era before the concentration of media control into a handful of giant monopolies and the corruption of leading journalists , pundits and broadcasters with six - and seven - figure incomes .
These bought - and - paid - for careerists — at the television networks , the cable channels , the news magazines , the New York Times , Washington Post and other major dailies — serve as little more than purveyors of official propaganda while covering up the crimes being committed by the American ruling elite , both in the Iraq war and in other acts of aggression worldwide and every day at home .

Last night I was watching the futures soar on news that Citigroup agreed to sell 4.9 % of the company to Abu Dhabi in return for $ 7.5 billion in cash .
See Abu Dhabi Deal Raises Questions About Citigroup 's Health .
This morning Minyanville Professor Quint Tatro was talking about The Great Transfer of Wealth .
The problems the U.S. is facing today have come as a result of its own actions and it is now facing the consequences .
This is nothing new and one can review many times in U.S. history when cycles have ebbed and flowed , resulting in booms and busts , the most recent being the technology bubble that came as a result of innovation , coupled with easy or cheap money and fueled by greed .
Now , however , it seems the U.S. ' white knight has arrived and the U.S. will gladly accept the international community 's assistance in working out its problems .
Of course , this comes at a price and that is a transfer of this wealth at an incredible discount .
While I am still not sure how I feel about it all and I still need to process it quite a bit , my job as a market participant is not necessarily to over - analyze but to find a way to profit from it .
I will be watching the financial stocks such as Citigroup , Washington Mutual ( WM ) , Bank of America ( BAC ) to see how they handle today 's news .
If they can bounce from these levels I would suspect the S&P may start to find its footing , but if they can not the blue light special may just have started .
Citigroup
Deal Smells Of Desperation
When I look at this deal it is quite interesting .
First of all , it must be understood that this is effectively an equity deal because of the mandatory conversion provision .
From the limited information I have been able to retrieve , it seems that Citigroup ( C ) is selling just under 5 % of the company for approximately $ 5.7 bln .
Why is it not the $ 7.5 bln that it is getting from the investors ?
Because Citi will have to pay interest on the $ 7.5 bln for just over two years , which will come out to approximately $ 1.8 bln .
$ 7.5 - $ 1.8 = $ 5.7 .
By my estimate , Citigroup has basically issued restricted equity ( to be officially issued in two - plus years ) at a price per share around the mid 20's when you take into account the 11 % interest it is paying on the $ 7.5 bln .
Additionally , Citi does get the benefit of using $ 7.5 bln now instead of only getting $ 5.7 bln now ( if it had just done a straightforward equity deal ) , while paying $ 1.8 bln over the next two - plus years in interest .
All in all , this deal is a tough deal for Citi in my opinion because it smells like desperation .
But do n't be confused about the 11 % .
It is clear since the deal has mandatory conversion prices that the 11 % interest rate is basically a discounting mechanism for the conversion price , which is why I say the equity was effectively issued in the mid 20's .
It also must be noted that doing a convertible may have certain tax advantages for Citi instead of doing a straight equity deal in the 20's .

Love them or hate them , the ALT .
NET mailing list is a source of interesting debate , commentary and insight .
I ca n’t help myself but to participate .
Debate is good .
Stifling debate is bad .
Period .
End of debate .
( see !?
That was bad ! )
The community itself is a young community , and as such , they are going through a period of identity forming .
What are their shared values ?
What does it mean to be an ALT .
NET -er ?
It ’s not exactly clear yet , but it is starting to form .
One thing I would caution this community is to be careful in how they define their shared principles .
For example , in one thread one individual mentioned debating me and then in the same message proposed the idea of Composition over Inheritance as a shared principle .
In response , someone posted this :
You can throw the book at those people–literally .
Favoring composition over inheritance is straight out of the Gang of Four book .
Do n’t like design patterns ?
Fine .
No problem .
I have a couple of Don Box COM + books that say the exact same thing .
Here was my response , which I also wanted to put in a blog post since it represents pretty well what I think .
I know Something Awful is known primarily as a humor site , but many friends have encouraged me to share my true story with the world .
Since this site gets fairly high traffic , I thought that it would be an appropriate venue to discuss my unique experiences .
Maybe some other kid out there is growing up with problems similar to mine , and perhaps my story can be of some comfort to him .
I was born with what are known as " fused genitals , " which means my penis and testicles are , in simple terms , all one thing ( though , at the same time , I do n't really have either one ) .
When I was an infant , my genitals just sort of looked like a flap of skin , but as I got older it became sort of a big sac of loose skin and hair .
Imagine a guy 's testicles , and then imagine that one of the testicles is about 6 inches long and really lumpy .
The thing is pretty odd looking to most people , and lord knows most girls do n't want anything to do with it , but it 's a decent size and I 'm not ashamed .
In terms of size and shape , imagine the circumference of two hot dog buns stuck together .
The half of it toward my pubis is pretty densely hairy , but it gets a little balder as it goes outward .
The testicles are kind of end - on - end inside the back half , and the front half is just kind of a sac of loose skin with some blood vessels and stuff inside .
It 's also very lumpy .
It does n't really get erect like a normal penis , but it does kind of engorge and swell up to about one and a half times its normal size , and it discolors a lot toward the end .
If I get too excited it gets very purple and it's pretty painful , so I do n't tend to look at a whole lot of porn ( luckily , sex does n't interest me too much anyway , since I take for granted that I wo n't be party to much of it in my lifetime ) .
Part One : The Babysitter
Though I was told by doctors when I reached puberty that I would never be able to feel physical sexual excitement , I already knew that was n't true .
Not being very old , I could n't necessarily tell you what sexual excitement was , but I instinctively knew that I 'd felt it ; I 'd felt that tingling , painful , pleasurable sensation in my genital sac many times in my life , and maybe it's not the same " sexual excitement " that people with standard genitals feel , but I 'd definitely call it sexual excitement .
The first time it happened was when I was around seven years old .
Though my genital sac is now about the size of two hot dog buns stuck together side by side , it was n't that big when I was a kid ; it was still much larger than most children 's baskets at that age , though .
In fact , it was a source of much childhood taunting , because if I ever wore shorts or sweatpants it would look as if I had a cucumber stuck in my pants .
People called me " boner boy , " not knowing the cruel irony of it ( since I could never have a " boner " the way normal people have them ) .
Its relatively large size caused lots of problems , because children 's clothes are n't really designed to accommodate a basket that large .
One day , I had to go to a church function , and my parents insisted that I wear slacks instead of my usual sweats .
I had a lot of difficulty zipping them up over my pubis , so eventually I stuck my hand in there and tried to hold it down against my body while I zipped my fly .
As I got the fly up more , I slowly pulled my hand out so I could keep it held down as long as possible .
Toward the end , there was just one thumb - sized spongy lump still sticking up / out , so I just tried to hold it down as best I could with one finger and zip up quickly .
It was a pretty big mistake , and the zipper caught it .
It basically looked exactly like that scene in There 's Something About Mary , where he gets his testicle caught ( in fact , I got kind of nauseous when I saw that movie because it brought back the memory ) .
The pain was terrible , but it was easy enough to get the zipper off .
There was some bleeding , but I was too embarrassed to tell my parents , so I just washed the blood off and left it .
During the church function , apparently the blood welled up in my pants and soaked through , because stood up and noticed a large spot of blood on my crotch .
I tugged my mom's sleeve and showed her , and she put a sweater around my waist and ushered me out of there to a doctor 's office .
The doctor stopped the bleeding pretty easily and bandaged me up ( and took a ton of photos of my genitals , which should probably have pissed me off but I was used to doctors taking photos of it , so I did n't care much ) .
He gave me a disinfectant cream to apply every day for a week to make sure it did n't fester , because the propensity of the area to sweat and shed lots of skin cells made it an ideal place for bacteria ( I have bacteria problems to this day , and I have to use three different products to keep the genital sac relatively odorless ) .
Comparisons and the Odious : Fakery , Actual and Conceptual
A number of years ago I had a portrait commission that still makes me chuckle .
I was asked to make a family portrait of a single mother and her three grown daughters , all of whom were unusually attractive and independent ladies from Texas .
The youngest daughter , who might have been the most beautiful of them all , had just gotten married , to an earnest and ambitious suitor whom I ’ll call Fred .
The five of them were to be the subjects of the portrait .
I set up my lights on the mother ’s veranda , and began playing with various arrangements of poses .
Spirits were high and the banter was flowing .
At one point , one of the daughters mentioned a friend of hers who had had occasion to airbrush an ex-husband out of the family picture , and she suggested that Fred might go in the back and towards the outside edge , just in case her sister ’s marriage did n’t work and he ever had to be airbrushed out .
This provoked gales of laughter , in which Fred manfully joined .
Well , the four women did n’t want to let this capital joke drop , and kept elaborating on it until they ’d worked themselves into a state of high hilarity .
Fred ’s laughter , of course , grew increasingly anemic , and he began to sprinkle in some weak protests .
But the really funny part is that they actually did insist that Fred go on the back and towards the outside .
So my finished picture , try though I might , featured four lovely women flushed with laughter and sporting toothsome grins , and a quite bewildered and crestfallen Fred … in back , and in a position where the four remaining subjects would look good were he ever removed .
Similarly , my friend Becky tells a story of an ex-boyfriend whom she clipped out of a large family portrait with nail scissors .
She said that her mother , thus encouraged , expertly clipped the photograph in two , snipped and trimmed some more , and slid the two ends together , which closed up the gap where the boyfriend had once been .
She said the surgery worked so well that it was difficult to tell , without looking closely , that the picture had ever been altered .
Propaganda has its uses
Of course , there are many instances in the history of photography of people fudging , faking , or otherwise editing photographs to change the apparent reality , sometimes for the sake of humor .
We ’re all aware of old postcards featuring a twenty - foot long trout or tomatoes the size of beach balls on horse - drawn wagons , or grinning tourists playing a trick of perspective and holding up the leaning tower of Pisa with an outstretched hand .
Anyone who has read Edward Weston ’s Daybooks knows how often , and how bitterly , he complained of the drudge - work of retouching portrait negatives to get rid of clients ’ wrinkles and blemishes .
Sometimes the intentions of the fakers is more sinister .
David King , in his book The Commissar Vanishes , documents just how routinely purged Soviet leaders were retouched out of the photographic record ; the CIA used to exhaustively examine such photographs to learn who was in favor at any particular time , and who was n’t , in the old Soviet hierarchy .
Unfortunately for the individuals involved , the newly missing were also often the newly executed .
But what is truth ?
Some fairly egregious rearrangements of photographic reality have been justified for allegedly " artistic " reasons .
There are a number of instances where even news photographs are altered .
One notorious example was Matt Mahurin ’s TIME magazine cover made from O. J. Simpson ’s mugshot , a " photo illustration " that was widely criticized for making Simpson look more heavily bearded and darker - skinned than he looks in the actual mugshot .
What is less often noted is that TIME may have gotten away with it but for the fact that NEWSWEEK ran the same mugshot on its cover , unaltered , that same week .
In fact , it ’s usually only by making direct comparisons that changes can be detected .
Some folks , " Where ’s Waldo " style , make a game and a pastime of doing this .
More power to ’em , if fakes are thereby detected and newsrooms kept more honest .
In fact , it is magazine covers that are probably the most high - profile culprits .
As anyone who ’s ever edited a magazine knows all too well , cover design is a black art and a constant source of strain and tension .
Joe Zeff , of Joe Zeff Design , says , " Consider the damage inflicted upon a photograph that is chosen to appear on a magazine cover .
First it must be tightly cropped to maximize its impact on the newsstand .
Next the logo is placed at the top , obscuring about 20 percent of the image .
A headline is added , as well as a subhead , as well as one or more teasers , sometimes with a smaller photograph of its own .
Finally , the bottom corner is compromised by a mailing label or a UPC code .
Not every photograph can withstand that kind of torture . "
( Quoted by Kenneth F. Irby at Poynteronline . )
Magazines alter pictures most often simply because magazines more often run type on top of pictures .
Things have to be massaged in order to fit together .
The punditocracy has so far produced no shortage of maundering about the contribution made to all this by the advent of digital imaging and Adobe Photoshop .
Really , though , this fits my general thesis that digital is a technological revolution but conceptually only a less significant evolution : digital fakery and manipulation are just one more sideways shuffle along the same old continuum .
Digital makes fakery and alteration easier to do and tougher to detect , but then , those two things have both been slip - sliding along more or less progressively since 1839 .
The ethics of it all are still just as murky as ever .
Bruce Goldfarb has an excellent online article athttp://larrysface.com/deception.htmthat shows many actual examples .
He shares some good links , too .
What ’s the frequency , Kenneth ?
It has often been argued that consumers are " media - savvy " enough to know that pictures might not be literal records .
This , of course , is an excuse that is highly appealing to us consumers — by which I mean you , reading this right now , and me — since of course each of us likes to believe that we are indeed savvy , perceptive , and tough to fool .
But , actually , I ’d argue the opposite .
In this early election season , both Kerry and Bush have played fast and loose with the facts in their television ads , especially Bush ( and no , that ’s not an editorial comment , it ’s just plain old truth ) .
Research has showed that although people say they are not affected by these falsehoods , actually they are , because when questioned about their beliefs in greater detail , they cite factoids that appear nowhere else but in the TV ads .
In the same way , I think that pictures that lie do tend to influence our vision of the world .
One of the striking aspects of Michael Moore ’s propaganda documentary Fahrenheit 9/11 is that he shows the dead , dying , and grieving on both sides , aspects of this war that have been largely censored by our government .
Are we fooled by the censorship ?
We may like to think we are n’t , but I believe we are , at least subliminally .
Americans believe this war is somehow more antiseptic than others , as though people are not being slaughtered and maimed as they inevitably are in any war .
Early in my career at Photo Techniques , I got into hot water by writing , under a pseudonym , a brief rebuttal of an author who was presenting composite landscapes .
I did it to fill a column left vacant by an 11th - hour withdrawal of an ad , but it was wrong of me — I was unfairly subverting that author ’s presentation , without allowing him to respond or react , and an editor should be an advocate for his or her authors , not an antagonist .
I hope I learned from my mistake , restricting my editorial comments to the editorial column from then on .
But the fact remains , I really do abhor composite images that are subtle enough to fool you into thinking they ’re real .
I object to them ethically , but I also object to them intellectually .
It ’s something I learned from my friend the photography writer Ctein , who told me he feels that all the photographs he ’s ever seen , in the aggregate , teach him how the world really looks , and that fake photographs distort and undermine that basic educational function .
In other words , it may be okay for a scenic to be pretty , but I tend to want it to be at least honest as far as it goes .
Even distortions of emphasis can be seen as lies .
I overheard a guy at the Wal - Mart the other day disparagingly refer to a display of Bill Clinton ’s new biography by saying it ought to be titled " My Lie . "
While that may be a bit harsh coming from a guy who had n’t read the book , there ’s no question that autobiography reorders things by emphasizing and de-emphasizing .
A few days later , articles popped up reporting that Monica Lewinsky strenuously objected to Clinton ’s portrayal of their affair , which , she felt , treated her as a mere cypher .
Her argument virtually proves itself by the fact that she merits only a few lines in a nearly 1,000 - page book .
( Of course , she ’s written her own autobiography . )
So is Clinton lying about that aspect of his life ?
Maybe not directly , but by implication and omission , yes .
As far as this same thing manifests itself photographically , consider my lifelong whipping boy , the travel pictorial .
You can see them in any discount book store — shelves full of picture books with place names : Ireland , Greece , Vermont , etc .
Crack open any one of them and flip through however many pages you can stand ; what you ’ll get is little apart from a sanitized official view of the area ’s formally picturesque places and scenes : its famous landscapes , noble old buildings , historical sites , and conventional clichés .
Is there any pictorial book of Vermont that does n’t include idyllic scenes of sap buckets on maple trees or Strafford ’s Paul Strand church , or any book about Ireland that does n’t feature at least one Glendalough ruin or adorable smiling red - haired tinker imp with no snot in its nose ?
The same books seldom feature lovingly - rendered pictures of unkempt alcoholics on the street or rural house trailers with dismantled washing machines out front .
The litmus test of the unreality of a travel book comes from , well , actually traveling to that place , and comparing the book version to what the place actually looks like .
I was lucky enough to get to do a lot of traveling early in my life , so when I saw travel books called France or Rome or The Bahamas , I actually knew what those places looked like .
The vision presented by the travel book , often as not , was nearly unrecognizable .
The same argument , however , might also be posited in reverse .
In a certain " documentary " tradition , only the gritty and the low are featured , and never anything beautiful .
You might say that such views are only the antithesis of the pretty and the antiseptic , showing only the ugly and the toxic .
Are any such books justified as argument ?
Probably so .
That is , they ’re making a case for one type of interpretation , not trying to present an accurate , unbiased picture .
I suppose some people do travel to distant locations just to look at the standard " sights , " and they do n’t let themselves really " see " the rest of what ’s there .
Still , the occasional book does come along that treads the middle ground , showing the lyrical and beautiful in a purely realistic , unsentimental context .
One such book is David Hurn ’s Wales : Land of My Father , which is a pure and cold - eyed documentary but nevertheless a deeply affectionate portrait .
Perhaps this should come as no shock , considering that Hurn , along with co-author Bill Jay , wrote a book that ’s a photographers ’ favorite , LensWork Publishing ’s On Being A Photographer .
Hurn ’s pictures surely possess the " slap of truth , " but something like the white foal in " Black Mountains " is undeniably beautiful by anyone ’s definition .
Color me hardcore
I ’m a fundamentalist when it comes to truth in photographs .
I think all pictures ought to be as true as possible , and that the only excuse for manipulation , beyond " fixing " the photograph technically , are changes meant to make it subjectively more truthful to the photographer ’s perception of the subject .
Changes for the sake of fit , " illustration , " decoration , or eye appeal make pictures not better photographs , but merely less photographic .

Newsletter Update :
Issue number 6 of my newsletter " The 37th Frame " has been published , the first to be delivered in .pdf format .
The response has been overwhelmingly positive so far .
It ’s 33 pages long ( nice big readable type ) , with 8 illustrations , about 520 k in size .
It contains the answers ( and the questions , too ! ) to the " Photo Culture Pop Quiz , " a brief reflection about photography ’s " first principles , " an article about a crucial but often overlooked aspect of print preservation , a greatly extended article about CD - R archivalness following up on the SMP column about the same subject several weeks ago , and an expanded news section ( with pictures ! ) , among much else .
I have so far delivered the issue to about one - fifth of the newsletter ’s 1,250 total subscribers , and am making progress delivering more in as much of my spare time as I can devote to the process .
If you ’re a subscriber and you have n’t gotten yours yet , hang tough , and do n’t despair .
I ’m creeping my way down the list virtually every day , addressing problems as they arise .
I want the new database to be correct , and SNAFU - proof , from the start ( fool me once … ) .
It may stretch out the delivery of this first .pdf edition , but it will greatly streamline subsequent deliveries .
One thing I was n’t able to get done is Part II of the 35 mm lens reviews , which will be in Issue # 7 along with the extended version of " Parameters of Lens Specification and the Properties of Lenses . " 35 mm lenses reviewed will be the Leica 35 mm ƒ/1.4 Summilux - M Aspherical ( Type 1 ) , Leica 35 mm ƒ/2 Summmicron - M ASPH . , Pentax Super-Multi-Coated Takumar 35 mm ƒ/2 M42 screwmount , AF - Nikkor 35 mm ƒ/2 , Leica 35 mm ƒ/2 Summicron -R , Pentax SMC Pentax - M 35 mm ƒ/2 , and Zeiss Contax Distagon 35 mm ƒ 1.4 .
It will also contain my nomination for the single best lens made for photography , which is kind of a silly exercise but kind of fun nevertheless .
So I guess Issue # 7 will be " the lens issue . "

newswire article commentary united states human & civil rights A Police Provocateur 's Dream , HR 1955 & S.1959 author : Ross Stone " The Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act " Rep.
Jane Harman 's " Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act " is not written exactly like the Nazi 1933 Discriminatory Decrees that suspended the Reich Constitution , but it can bring America to the same place by trashing America 's civil liberties .
Harman 's bill has the potential of driving lawful political and other activists underground into American cell groups .
Perhaps expectantly creating the domestic terrorists the Bush Administration has said we need to be protected from .
The Nazis were dead serious when they outlawed specific types of dancing , singing , artwork ; any act of expression the Government said " might " cause public unrest in the German State .
German Citizens got arrested for dancing the Jitterbug .
On February 28 , 1933 Hitler signed the Discriminatory Decrees banning free association and speech that might cause public disturbance or adversely affect the peace and security of the German State according to police .
Rep. Jane Harman's " Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act " when closely examined , defines " homegrown terrorism " as " any planned act " that might use force to coerce the U.S. Government or its people to promote or accomplish a " political or social objective . "
No actual force need occur .
Government need only charge that an individual or group thought about doing it .
The Harman bill may extend to " planned acts " in America against foreign governments that are " U.S. alleys . "
See " planned acts " covered under Patriot Act .
Under the Harman bill , environmental organizations in America are at risk when they coordinate activities with or support foreign activist groups in some countries .
American environmental organizations can't control what might happen overseas at a " planned " environmental demonstration or control the " planned acts " of foreign activists they network with .
Under the broad language of the Harman bill , anyone attending a " planned anti war rally " could be charged with trying to coerce a government and its people .
Government need only charge that an individual in a group " thought about coercing a government or its people . "
Labor demonstrators that block or intimidate shoppers from entering a store could be charged with " coercing people " under Harman 's " Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act . "
The Nazi's used similar provisions found in the Harman bill to charge labor leaders as communists .
Under the Harman bill , should violence breakout at a " planned " demonstration , the government can charge that everyone attending was " ideologically based toward violence . "
The individual activists who set up web sites promoting their " planned activities " , wrote , emailed or handed out " flyers " promoting " that planned " demonstration could also be charged with Violent Radicalization or Homegrown Terrorism , depending on the violence that occurred at the demonstration .
It is foreseeable that " information flyers " not intended by the author to be distributed at a particular event but were somehow distributed , could under the Harman bill open the door for government to charge the author with promoting " Violent Radicalization and / or Homegrown Terrorism , if that subsequently results .
Such concerns by writers will crush free speech and written dissent .
The broad language of the Harman bill gives the government the power to bully and charge Americans with terrorism when Citizens exercise their Constitutional Right to Association .
Lawful Americans that attend public meetings , demonstrations and other group public events should not be charged with Violent Radicalization , Homegrown Terrorism , or labeled " ideologically based toward violence " because of what another person said or did at a " planned " meeting .
Of course , under such circumstances millions of Americans would become afraid to support or attend political and other public meetings out of concern someone might do something that violates Rep. Harman 's " Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act . "
Attendance by an American at a " political or environmentalist ' meeting " could put a U.S. Citizen on the government 's " no fly list . "
Should the Jane Harman bill pass in its present form , the U.S. Government , federal and state police will have no difficulty legally terminating American Citizens and activist organizations that exercise their Constitutional Right to free association , free speech , expression , assembly and writings .
Once the Harman bill passes , Police Provocateurs can easily destroy any anti-war group , person or organization that supports or attends a " planned " meeting or demonstration .
Police Provocateurs need only join a crowd of protestors at a demonstration , then throw rocks toward uniformed police to criminalize an entire demonstration .
Or covertly contact a group 's participants before , at or after a " planned " demonstration , then lie and claim the person (s ) the Provocateur spoke with were ideologically bent toward violence ; " Violent Radicalization ; or Homegrown Terrorism .
Uneducated police provocateurs and informants , which there are many , are more apt to misinterpret intellectual discussion at a political meeting as being ideologically bent toward violence , " Violent Radicalization or Homegrown Terrorism .

To me , Perl 6 is like a director 's cut of CPAN .
From the RFC process till today , each part of Perl 6 feature either came from , or has been realized , as CPAN modules .
( cf. the v6. pm stack diagram -- much more modules are present in each layer than shown there . )
During the making of Perl 6 , what we are doing can be seen as : Take those Perl 5 extensions , which are all nice tools that solves real problems , present them as the default , and make them play well with each other .
Of course , the " play well " part involves a lot of work .
However , one thing I like about the v6.pm path is it 's gradual and completely opt-in .
If you are interested only in some part of Perl 6 , use them as CPAN modules today .
For the few features that truly needs internals support , simply upgrade to 5.10 .
When the CPAN community is reasonably happy with the tool chain , we 'll see more CPAN modules written with " use v6 - alpha ; " as their first line , calling for more integrated internal support in Perl 5.12 .
When all of it works well together enough that TimToady ++ is happy to declare the syntax stable , then it'd be time to drop the " - alpha " suffix .
Which would n't be this Christmas , but the advent has started now . :-)
That plan , however , omits one part of CPAN :
It can not get all the Inline : :* languages play well with each other .
Fortunately , the Parrot project is making a director 's cut of all dynamic languages , and have them play well with each other ...
Question for you .
You are a lot closer to Parrot development than I am .
However as an outsider I 've given up on Parrot achieving its original goals .
Has there been any sign that what I complained about there is changing ?
Is there , for example , any sign that we will someday have a version of Python running on Parrot that can pass the Piethon ?
Like the Python and JPython do , and IronPython almost does .
After this I 've wondered from day one how incompatible behaviours between different languages will be handled .
Everything from minor discrepancies ( eg whether you create new copies of data upon assignment , or upon modification ) to major design issues ( eg how you break down your error - handling hierarchy ) .
But over time I 've become convinced that we 'll never get to the point where we have to worry about that .
I 'd love to be wrong on this .
I really would .
But I fear I 'm not .
To me , Perl 6 is like a director 's cut of CPAN .
So , will Han shoot first ? :D
I enjoyed Perl4 .
I was also glad when Perl5 came out , and as successive versions of Perl5 acm out , and CPAN dramatically expanded its capabilities , Perl has become a central part of my work life .
Based on its current strengths and the promising plans for Perl6 , my team at work is planning to move our legacy applications into Perl .
I also really like Perl .
I like the Perl community .
I like the appreciation of language that it brings to working with computers .
I 'm even not that impatient about the wait for Perl6 , since it was clear some time ago that Perl6 was a very large undertaking .
Thus am I one of the faithful .
But as one of the faithful , I think there are some important issues highlighted in both Perl needs The Solution and Perl is dying .
While Perl6 will give us a great deal , there are still some problems that it wo n't solve .
And yes , some of those problems may be significant enough to blunt Perl 's future success .
Pluralism is one of Perl 's greatest strenghts , and responsible for much of its thriving success .
While we 're benefitting from pluralism , we also need to mittigate some of its costs .
For me , the most important ways we can do this are to provide : A guide to Best Practices .
A set of recommendations on pre-Perl6 goodies , one that is aimed at the people who ask questions on PM .
A package of modules for doing web apps , one which well serves those who are n't committed to using Perl , and who would rather go check out Rails if you present them with a list of different choices with the strengths and weeknesses of each .
The Damian has given us the first item on this list and we owe him our deep gratitude , both for seeing the need and for doing the job .
While the recomenations are very good , IMO , for some purposes just the existence of authoritative recomendataions is the most important part , and is enough to take care of a score of reasonable concerns about Perl .
When you 're selling perl for a major project , and management has heard rumors about tower - of - babble coding practices , you can plunk his book down on the table and you do n't have to say much after that .
If those with the knowledge and credibility can establish the other two items anywhere near as well as TheDamian has managed the first , with Best Practices , then Perl will be a very strong contender for being " the language for the rest of us " .
The additions wo n't make it any less of a wonderfully flexible language for those of us who already know it fairly well , they will just help others to follow .
This is not a matter of fad or fashion , it 's just a matter of improving service to a wider community .
There _is_ a Perl Best Practices , by HRH Damien Conway .
Excellent book , BTW .
> package of modules for doing web apps
Try WebGui - its more than a CMS , it is a " an application framework that handles content management " .
Sigh .
WebGui may be may be an absolutely wonderful system .
For myself , I appreciate the tip and I will check into it further than I have , but my point was that most people who are newer to perl wo n't do that .
There are many wonderful systems and modules out there providing functions that may be relevant to a first project .
There are even some less wonderful systems that look good at the start .
It 's too much to deal with for someone who is learning his / her way around .
Later , as experience grows , it can be a valuable education to look at what others have done and how they 've done it , and it can be a satisfying exploration .
We need to help people through the early stage so they can get to that later one .
WebGUI is not a framework IMHO , it just is a CMS with plugins .
The original article mentions two web frameworks and they are the best IMHO : Catalyst and CGI :: Application .
I do n't think Perl hackers have any sort of " inferiority complex " .
What I see happening is that some people are perhaps feeling a bit threatened by the popularity of other languages , wondering whether they 're wisely staying with a superior language ( Perl ) , or whether they 're missing something even better .
That 's always going to be a question with computer trends .
In the past , conservatism has usually resulted in stagnation and losing the lead on new technology .
Why trouble with those new - fangled VDT's , when you can just toggle the code in through the front - end switches ?
I fought like a tiger against using a mouse ...
Part of the problem , I suspect , is our impatience to see Perl6 unveiled .
Everyone else has a bright , shiny new toy to play with , and we 're still using good old Perl 5 .
Poor us ...
And yet , it says a great deal that Perl 5 is still competitive , considering its advanced age .
I like Perl 5 .
I 'm content to use it , until Perl6 comes along .
I still have plenty to learn about Perl 5 , to keep me busy .
Once I 've learned all the language , I 'll get impatient - but if I ever get that good , I 'll start helping out with Perl6 .
I agree that TIMTOWTDI has paid off handsomely and continues to do so .
It seems to me that a similar approach works in biology .
Genetic diversity pays off .
You never know when some off - the - wall mutation will be the one to survive the changing environment .
Too much purity leaves a species vulnerable to extinction by impairing its ability to create these mutations .
That 's OK if the environment is stable - but history shows this is not the case .
In IT , the environment is even less stable .
Perl 5 is n't hard for newbies - unless you 're referring to those who have never programmed in any language .
Programming itself is difficult for a newcomer , because it requires a highly structured way of thinking that is not usually taught to non-programmers .
It 's the disciplined thinking that is difficult , not the particular idiom ( though some idioms are more difficult to grasp ) .
For someone who already understands the concepts of programming , Perl is not at all difficult to learn .
I agree , Perl 5 is n't hard for newbies , it 's just a little hard for the relative newbie to accomplish what they want in Perl .
That accomplishment usually involves the web .
PHP and Ruby make that easier , as matthewsnape above makes clear .
If we reduce the hastle of that first accomplishment in Perl , more talented people will start Perl earlier , get used to its advantages , learn , and contribute .
The health of a language depends as much on the new talent coming in as it does on the accomplished fellows already here .
I have read discussions about " dying Perl " , " Perl needeng a solution to survive " and i went through the comments to this node .
I still think that my Engish is to poor to explain my thoughts about this discussion .
But i'll try .
I think that every computer language is a INSTRUMENT .
Like a hammer or a drill .
And if you need to to a certain work , you will choose the instrument to do it — but you wo n't think that " My hammer is better than any drill , so i'll perforate holes in the wall with it " or " Hammers are dying , so i'll drive this nail with my favourite drill " .
You will take the drill or the hammer and do the appropriate work with it , wo n't you ?
I do my own work with Perl — and i can explain why i chose Perl to do it .
And it does not matter for me if PHP is more popular than Perl or not .
And i do n't understand how the popularity of PHP , Python , Ruby or VB does affect the usage of Perl for tasks that are better solved with it .
P.S .
I understand that there are people who learn their first language to create the first dynamic webpage in their life .
They will choose PHP .
As PHP is a " language for creating dynamic webpages " :)
And if somebody forgot , PHP was initially written in Perl as The Solution for creating webpages :) s;; Just - me - not-h- Ni-m - P - Ni-lm - I - ar - O - Ni ; ; tr?
IerONim-?
HAcker ?d; print
" Hammers are dying " Hilarious . :)
Yes , very well said - it's the tool ( or " instrument " as you said , but same point ) .
There is a saying , though - " to someone with a hammer , every problem looks like a nail . "
Something to think about .
Our choice of solution may depend on our tool or instrument , as much as our choice of tool might depend on the problem .
I 'm sorry to hear that hammers are dying .
I 'll have to go out and buy another drill now .
IMO when Perl was the only alternative for fast programming , it got many attention .
When other scripting languages appeared , they , of course , distract attention .
However I do n't see perl comunity as shrinking ...
Also , consider following evolution - assembler - is convenient way to write machine code .
C - is big assembler ( much more convenient to code , and still very close to hardware )
Perl - is big C , it is very similar to C except its code more condensed and easier to write .
But other scripting languages could perfectly replace Perl .
XXXXX - is big Perl .
At this step something special should be invented ...
Is it perl6 ? :)
I think that the whole " is perl dyeing " debate tends to over complicate the issue .
It assumes that people even make a coherent decision as to what framework or language they use .
I have spent years coding perl to create web applications .
The reason I decided on Perl in the begininng was because it was a scripting language supported on the free netfirms hosting package .
Since then PHP has taken over as the easiest most available scripting language .
My point is that we tend to over emphasize the importance of high end coding .
I continued with Perl because it was so acessibile to people with little coding experience .
You could create inrteresting stuff by using a handfull of modules .
The quality of the source was low , but you could still get results .
In recent years Perl has become less useful to people like me .
Things like Class :: DBI , CGI :: Application and mason are great , but out of the reach of most people who dont have there own server .
Look at godaddy ( largest shared hosting provider in North America ) , most of CPAN is out of reach to these users .
Just to difficult to install .
Perl may run on any OS , but it is inaccesible to many users .
The Perl community has always prided itself for being compatible on any os .
But Perl does have an accessibility problem for new users on limited systems .
A small nit .
It 's perfectly possible to run a CGI :: Application on a shared hosting provider .
See " Hello world " for CGI :: Application .
But is it easy for an inexperienced user to do ?
I believe that CPAN offers a huge benefit to inexperienced programmers .
But expecting them to install the modules themselves and adjust their code to use those libraries may be to great a hurdle .
CPAN is cool precisely because you dont have to install modules yourself or adjust your code .
New users of language are fickle and to many " Internal Server " errors can really put them off .
Inferiority Complex ??
I would say the opposite .
Most Perl hackers , when confronted with another language , respond with " I do n't need that sh*t , I already have Perl " . :-)
I 'm not really a human , but I play one on earth .
I 'm not really a human , but I play one on earth .
Cogito ergo sum a bum
Let me explain what I mean by " insecure " .
Never needing to look outside our own box to find a solution sounds like a good thing ( and it is ) , but after years of not having to look elsewhere for solutions , I found myself questioning whether I was missing out !
It is so rare that I come across a coding problem that requires more than 2 minutes searching CPAN before I discover a solution ( or several ! ) .
Rare .
Maybe too rare .
So rare in fact that I feel insulated from the rest of the coding world .
I have never come across a problem I could not solve with Perl .
The added bonus of direct access to the source code of CPAN modules has given me an accelerated learning path ( compared with Java or . NET ) - further perpetuating the cycle of Perl - only knowledge .
Or is it ?
I happen to work at a 50/50 Microsoft / OSS shop where everything * we * write is written in VB , and anything * I* write is in Perl .
At one point we were going to convert everything to Perl , but nobody else bothered learning Perl .
To make a long story short , we 're doing .NET now .
Having spent the last few weeks porting some VBScript code to C# , it 's not much different than when I ported something similar from VBScript to Perl .
It could be that it was me doing the porting both times , and that both Perl and C# have a C - style syntax .
In the past I have experimented with C++.
Even though it is considered a " real " programming language , I could n't see how anyone got anything * done * in it - so much that I took for granted with Perl simply was not available to me .
Learning C# was very different .
Even though it has static typing and " One Way To Do It " , its garbage collection and the .
Net framework class library ( analogous to a proprietary CPAN ) means I can be more productive than I would be with C++ , since most of the wheels I need have already been built and are part of the standard install .
( Nice run-on sentence ! ) .
I look forward to Perl6 with its vast CPAN library , built - in object system , threading and delegation .
The " insulation " factor will probably still be there , but since Parrot will promote interoperability , the insulation may be more transparent .
These two last years , when the chief requested a new task to me , my motto was :
" Naaah ! , I can make it in TWO lines !... "
This was my work :)
A hammer for a nail ; a screwdriver for a screw .
Yeah , there are some people who will use a butter knife to screw in the leads to an electrical socket , just as there are those who will use a stale loaf of bread wrapped up in six layers of aluminum foil and dipped in three coats of shellac to use as an organic mallet on the third day after midsummer 's eve to pound Hershey 's kisses into used corn cobs .
Why do people do these things ?
It 's a fear of change , or sheer laziness .
And learning a new perl dialects is no different .
One chum codes everything as .pl files , all Perl4 - esque , and hates anything OO in Perl5 .
Another has been living on the latest tidbits of Perl6 to come out .
However , I 've also encountered people completely new to Perl programming , and they 're not overwhelmed at all .
They credit the plethora of books that have been written , and especially the user community here at perlmonks.org , with dispelling any FUD they might have about the language .
I myself am helping them become more comfortable about using regexes , and sure enough they learning it , and learning it well .
No fancy IDEs , no Eclipse , no VS.NET .
Just vi and a dream .
I 've used Eclipse , and I like it for Java , but it 's like jumping back into smalltalk on steroids after a fashion , and using a heavy IDE can sometimes be daunting , just like trying to learn enough TSO / ISPF and JCL to compile COBOL programs .
Do Perl hackers have an inferiority complex ?
Not that I 've seen .
We 're some of the most capable , strong - willed , upstanding bunch I know .
The industry tends to play us down in favor of more traditional ( read : compiled ) languages , such as Java or C# .
What Perl6 will do to that perception will depend on which CIO reads the appropriate Hip & Trendy ™ buzzwords in some magazine recommended by Someone - Who - Knows .
Is Perl in any danger of dying out ?
No .
It 's ubiquitous because it is useful , and continues to evolve with its programming family of adherents .
Falling off my soapbox ,
- v. " Perl .
There is no substitute . "
I think your title is too melodramatic , and overgeneralizing .
You make good points , and I agree with most of what you say , but - IMHO - you overstate the validity of the claims made in those threads .
Just look at the arguments made by chromatic and Ovid .
Their points are convincing enough in their own right , but if you realise where they work , you can see how that gives them an excellent view on the overall state of Perl .
From where I stand , that makes them far more authorative than some random anonymonk .
< rant >
I have the sneaking suspicion that the handful of FUD - spreading anonymonks are just a bunch of whiny saps who landed lousy jobs , where they resent the technology desicions being made higher - up , and think their peers are all monkey coders .
Their complaints are n't with Perl itself , but stem from their unhappiness with their personal situation .
</ rant > --
Yes , it 's a hot day ;^ )
Finally a place for people to weigh in where the parent node is n't a Diggthink - powered troll .
I use perl because
* it 's on every * N * X server I encounter and I never have to install it
* I can use it for just about everything
* the might of clean code is insignificant compared to the power of a stream of oneliners Given these three , even if there were no CPAN I would use perl .
By way of analogy the trolls are saying I should throw away my dependable Swiss Army knife and learn how to use the new deluxe canopener that just came out instead .
It bears mentioning that drivel like this never saw the light of day back when perl5 was released .
We said things like " I like sed better than perl because I know it so well " .
We never said " perl is teh suxors , use C " and we killfiled anyone who did .
We did n't have time for meaningless noise because we were too busy building the Internet with perl , all because we had a dream that someday moronic youngsters would be able to send each other into fits of apoplexic rage by insulting each others technology from a thousand miles away .
If you have a church I want to join !!
Hallelujah brother !
The internet was n't built on perl .
The biggest problem I have with perl is this idea that no other language should exist .
In this thread alone , how many people have indicated that " after Perl 6 comes out and we get some GUI environments for it , etc. then no one will want to use any other languages " .
You do n't see this in any of the other comunities , why is it seemingly the dominant voice in Perl land ?
It was this attitude expressed daily from a college for over 5 years that has driven me away from Perl forever .
Personally , I would n't know what is said in other communities , because I find everything I need with Perl and PM .
If you 've been " driven ... away from Perl forever " , what are you doing here ?
Apparently you still have some feelings for the language or its users - some attraction .
I am often puzzled by how many people come here to explain how Perl is n't worth anything , it 's a useless , stupid language , blah , blah , blah - and yet , they return here daily to tell us all about it .
Do n't you have any programs to write ?
Problems , not The Solution .
No , Perl does not need ' The Solution ' to survive , it needs Problems , and there are lots of problems in daily development work that Perl is The Uniquely Best Suited Tool to solve in the most clean , concise , efficient and portable way .
Results , not Hype .
To realize this requires a broad and deep personal experience with computer architectures , OS 'es , languages and tools ( ie . you must have worked with complex data structs such as deep combined hashes&arrays and you must have wrestled with pointers / references in C , C++/ STL , C# , Java , AWK , Perl etc. on DOS'es , UNIX 'es and WindowsXX'es ) .
The Perl Way , or the Highway .
Maybe you just need a fast & flashy framework to put up a web site .
Maybe you just need a large scale team framework to crank out a lot of heavy business objects .
Then , maybe you do n't need the general power and flexibility of Perl to solve the tasks in your specific problem domain , or maybe you do n't want to enter a long learning curve to master yet another general language with a large library .
Then by all means : take The Highway that will solve your specific problem today !
" Who 's inferior or dying ? "
But do n't think Perl is dying because the majority of developers may take The Highway to solve specific problems ;
The majority of developers do not have a broad and deep personal experience with computer architectures , OS 'es , languages and tools , but the day they really crash&burn on The Highway with their slick&slim or obese&obstructing vehicles , they will either die , -- or they will go looking for an offroader like Perl to cruise the bush , just like wee did , back then when we needed it .
And they will certainly not feel inferiorior for having a Hummer in the driveway
The Way i see it ,

Why hide behind anon monk ?
How is Perl5 hard ?
I am not a programmer by trade and I was able to write things .
Unless of course you are that snob that wrote about writing perfect code .
Perl is not going away anytime soon .
New languages are just like fads .
Some last , many do n't , and some you never hear about .
It does n't mean anything , but I have n't heard about Eclipse ....
Why hide behind anon monk ?
I do n't remember my password ( I'm jdrago_999 ) and I can't check the email address it goes to ( my work email ) from home .
How is Perl5 hard ?
It 's not hard - it 's super easy .
And super powerful .
And , to paraphrase Larry Wall , maybe just a little too flexible at times .
I have n't heard about Eclipse ....
Eclipse is a platform that happens to have a popular Java IDE built on top of it ( as well as several other languages , including Perl ) .
You can learn more at The Eclipse Website
Yes !
We need a best IDE that Eclipse ... but as long as with Eclipse we can program in Perl ( screenshot ) .
( Komodo is the best commercial tool , of course )
For the record - I 'm now at work and this was my post .
I 'd just like to point out that I feel a lot better about the imminent doom that is Perl 6 after seeing Autrijus ' v6 talk at Boston .
PM .
With v6 you can start using some of the good bits of Perl 6 , but are n't yet forced to adopt all the nastiness too ;-) ... although they are working on it .
As for newbies , I too , do not see how P6 is going to be " beeter " .
Indeed , for sometime it will probably be worse until everyone gets used to having the rug yanked out form underneath them .
UPDATE : By everyone , I mean the experienced perl hacks whom would help the newbies .

Justification against Java

A Perl vs. Java fight brews over in SoPW is quite relevant to this discussion .
Take a look at it if you have n't seen it yet .
And if you know Java reasonably well then it's a chance to help make the case for Perl where it counts , in a team 's pending design decision .
Update : link fixed .
( Thanks jdporter . )
I use both C# and Perl without considering one superior to the other one .
If I want a GUI interface , I use C# ( version 2003 - have n't been able to convince my fiance that 2005 is needed ) .
For utility type programs , I tend to use perl .
I use the tool that is best for the particular job at hand .
Perl and .NET are about the same for cross platform compatibility ( . NET * does * work with other platforms : see Mono ) .

I have n't coded Perl for a while now , but I read this and felt obligated to comment .
I 've coded Perl and found it easy to learn , but sophisticated enough to handle very complex problems .
I have n't been keeping up with it primarily because of demands from my programming job , where I 'm having to master .
Net , but I can honestly say Perl rocks , and will always have a place in my toolbox and on my resume .
I have been a big Perl fan for many years , but I admit I 'm on to Ruby now .
Why ?
Because Ruby 1.8 has many of the features Perl 6 is going to have , but Ruby 1.8 is here NOW , and that makes all the difference in the world .
Also , the implicit comparison of Rails to any old CPAN module is disingenuous .
Rails is far more comprehensive than any single CPAN module and far more well integrated than any handful of CPAN modules one might combine to do the same thing .
I miss CPAN , though , for most things that are not Rails .
CPAN has far more modules and most of them are more mature of course than their Ruby equivalents .
I often come back to Perl so I can get at something I need from CPAN , and when I do , I find now that the core language feels " clunky " compared to Ruby .
Maybe when Perl 6 gets here people like me will once again count Perl their favorite language instead of second favorite .
" Dying " may be an exaggeration , but there 's no denying that the long development of Perl 6 has cost some mindshare .
But that leads to another point - who cares ?
It 's not like Ruby and Perl are competing for market cap or customer dollars .
Like I said , I can switch between them at need because I paid zero dollars for both of them .
The plural of library is " libraries " not " librarys "

It 's hard to take someone seriously who does n't pay attention to details .
The plural of library is " libraries " not " librarys "
You mean
The plural of " library " is " libraries " , not " librarys " .
It 's hard to take someone seriously who does n't pay attention to details .
Indeed .
Heh - I would have fixed it but I wrote it as " Anonymous Monk " .

Well , we can allude to the forthcoming Perl6 all we want , but : " real artists ship . "
We need n't allude to Perl6 .
Perl 5 is alive and well , doing quite nicely , thank you .
If you feel some other language is more appropriate , do not hesitate to use it .
As Ernest and Julio Gallo said , " We will ship no software before its time " - or words to that effect .
