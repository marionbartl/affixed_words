Some of you here know about my ongoing love for Okami .
I ’ve been pretty vocal in the forums about how much the game impressed me .
It does have its faults , but the title is just such an engrossing an charming adventure that I became hooked almost from the beginning .
So , of course I ca n’t help but hope that Okamiden , a new trademark discovered in the Japanese database , is some sort of new Okami title .
Even though Capcom has never really expressed interest in a sequel in the past , the company does own the rights to the IP .
Unfortunately , you can never be too sure how these trademark findings will turn out .
I , however , would be incredibly happy to see Amaterasu in another Okami title .

I have been rereading the legislative history of the 1909 Copyright Act .
I have come to the conclusion that 100 years ago we were smarter about copyright , about disruptive technologies , about intellectual property , monopolies and network effects than we are today .
At least , the legislative hearings were much smarter .
The hearings I am looking at took place in 1906 — thanks to the wonder of Google books you can read them yourself , if you are really nerdy .
There are lots of delights here .
There is John Philip Sousa ( yes , the one who wrote the march that forms the Monty Python theme music ) popping up again and again to make his point ..
So far as I can tell , he had a wild card from the chair to interrupt whenever it suited him .. viz .
The thing that Sousa ( and some other American composers ) and the music publishers were most upset about was the fact that copyright covered printing and public performance , but did not cover the mechanical reproduction involved in cutting a roll for a player piano or recording a disk or a cylinder for a phonograph or gramophone .
Their goal was to get a new provision ( section g ) which would give composers ( and thus publishers ) the right to charge a royalty for these sound recordings .
In strong opposition was the recording industry — which violently denied that the copyright holders should gain any share of the new market that ( as they saw it ) had been created out of thin air by technological innovation .
To give copyright holders a veto over technology , they argued , would be fatal to the progress the Copyright Clause was designed to promote .
As Larry Lessig points out in Free Culture ( which has a superb chapter on this story ) there is no small irony involved here , since this is the opposite position that the recording industry takes today ( having secured their legal rights ) when they face the new technologies of the Net .
What ’s more , the representatives of the recording and player piano industry believed that there was no harm being done to the composers by the mechanical reproduction of their music .
( statement of Albert Walker , representative of the Auto - Music Perforating Company of New York )
There were intense debates about the constitutionality of the legislation — piano rolls were not “ writings ” and restricting accessibility to them was not thought to promote the progress of science or the useful arts , and there were even debates about the correct way to conceptualize intellectual property rights …
There were discussions of whether intellectual property was the norm or the exception
And , my favourite of all , there were passionate attacks on the morality of the publisher ’s position on the ground that it was the technologies and not the content , that had revolutionized music in the way the constitution envisaged , by dramatically expanding its distribution to the public , removing the bottleneck of the human who was required to translate musical score into listenable music .
That ’s Philip Mauro of the American Graphophone Company — who later became a leading religious writer — and at the end he is striking the note that all the technologists did .
The music publishers had a web of contracts in place with which they would create a “ trust ” , a monopoly , that would dominate music and restrict its availability to the public .
As Mauro saw it , on the one side was the threat of monopoly , the squelching of innovation and the greed of the content owners , who were exploiting a misconception about the absolute quality of property rights .
“ All talk about dishonesty and theft in this connection from however high a source is the merest claptrap for there exists no property in ideas musical , literary or artistic except as defined by statute . ”
I quote all this not because I agree with the record industry of the 1900 ’s — though I wish their representatives today were similarly sophisticated .
I ’d really like the RIAA to read Mr. Mauro ’s speeches and see if it makes them change their minds at all about the disruptive technologies of today .
I find no injustice in the composers getting a share of the revenues produced by sound recordings and piano rolls — I would have voted for it myself .
And the solution to the problem of the latent monopoly — namely a compulsory license — accomplished that goal without stultifying the technology or restricting distribution to the public .
All in all — the fulminations of Sousa and Mauro aside — it was a pretty nice piece of legislation .
The legislators actually seemed to understand the arguments made to them .
The conceptual confusions of absolute property rights were repeatedly debunked .
There were explicit balances made in the statute — weighing technological progress and the encouragement of the arts and culture .
Constitutional arguments were weighed and taken into account .
They even saw and mitigated the threat of monopoly with a compulsory license .
Nowadays when a compulsory license over , say AIDS drugs , is pursued by a country like Thailand , the US Trade Representative beats them up for adopting such “ radical ” and confiscatory approach .
Nothing could be more foreign to the American tradition of intellectual property than compulsory licenses !
Hogwash .
Our music industry is built on them .
The world of 1906 was hardly perfect — I would n’t want to live then .
And the 1909 statute was full of its own boondoggles and industry grabs .
But if one looks back at these transcripts and compares them to today ’s hearings — with vacuous rantings from celebrities and the bloviation of bad economics and worse legal theory from one industry representative after another — it is hard not to feel a sense of nostalgia .
In 1900 , it appears , we were better at understanding that copyright was a law that regulated technology , a law with constitutional restraints , that property rights were not absolute and that the public would not automatically be served by extending rights out to infinity .

WASHINGTON  The Obama administration released final rules governing stem cell research on Monday that will allow many older stem cell lines to be eligible for federally financed research .
The changes came in response to criticism from scientists that the rules that the administration proposed in April  requiring that donors of fertilized eggs sign extensive consent forms  would have made even some of the stem cell lines approved by the Bush administration ineligible for further money .
Dr. Raynard S. Kington , acting director of the National Institutes of Health , said in a news conference that his agency would insist that any scientists creating stem cell lines after Tuesday follow the new rules to the letter for their work to be eligible .
Scientists using stem cell lines created before Tuesday may seek review by a group of the Advisory Committee to the Director .
If the lines were created under conditions that met the spirit but not the letter of the new rules , they will be approved , Dr. Kington said .

A gunman has killed 13 people after taking dozens hostage in the US state of New York .
The suspected gunman was later found dead inside the immigration centre in Binghamton , police officials said .
Nearly 40 people escaped from the building but four were critically injured in the shooting , north - west of New York City , police said .
Pakistani Taleban leader Baitullah Mehsud called the BBC in Islamabad to claim responsibility for the attack .
He gave no evidence to corroborate the claim .
President Barack Obama , in Europe for a Nato summit , said he was " shocked and saddened " by the attack 's " senseless violence " .
See map of the area Mr Obama said his administration was " actively monitoring the situation " and that Vice - President Joe Biden was in touch with officials in Binghamton .
About 15 or so employees came out crying with their hands behind their heads
Eyewitness
Witnesses : Binghamton shooting
The town 's police chief , Joseph Zikuski , told a news conference that 14 people had been found dead in the American Civic Association ( ACA ) buildings .
The man believed to have carried out the attack was found dead with an apparently self - inflicted gunshot wound , he said .
Ammunition , two more hand guns and a hunting knife were recovered from the scene .
Democratic Congressman Maurice Hinchey told AP the gunman had entered a room where people were sitting exams for US citizenship .
" It was in the middle of a test .
He just went in and opened fire , " said Mr Hinchey , whose congressional district includes Binghamton .
The BBC's Matthew Price in Binghamton says people in the town are struggling to deal with the horror of what some have described as an " unbelievable " attack .
Wounded Witnesses reported seeing a man entering the ACA building during the morning .
He was described as being of Asian appearance , in his 20s , and wearing a bright green nylon jacket and dark - rimmed glasses .
The gunman , believed to have been a Vietnamese - American , used his car to barricade the building 's back door before bursting in the front door , firing his weapon , said officials .

Binghamton is the latest American town trying to come to terms with a mass shooting .
Last week it was Carthage , North Carolina .
The week before Samson , Alabama .
With the red and blue lights of police cars flashing through the drizzle , smokers huddle in doorways on Main Street .
There is only one topic of conversation .
" It 's a very good area , I would never think that it would happen here , " said Martine Youmans .
The words and the scenes are increasingly familiar for Americans .
On local talk radio stations the chatter has already turned to gun law , still as divisive an issue as ever .
One caller 's plea : " Do n't let them take away our guns . "
He shot two receptionists , one of whom managed to call the police , before walking down a corridor towards classrooms .
Police were on the scene in minutes - people in nearby apartments , a school and a care home were told to stay in their buildings and some streets were sealed off .
Mr Zikuski said 26 people took refuge in the building 's basement after hearing gunshots .
Eyewitnesses described seeing some people fleeing the building .
" About 15 or so employees of the Civic Association came out crying with their hands behind their heads , " one witness told Binghamton 's WNBF Radio .
" They were escorted by the police and they took them to ambulances and took them away , " he said .
Two other people were seen being led away by police in plastic handcuffs during the incident but officials later said they were not suspects .
Police later raided the home of the suspected gunman and removed items including computer hard drives and a rifle bag , reports said .
' Profound outrage ' Local hospitals have said about 30 people are being treated .
RECENT US SHOOTINGS March 2009 : A gunman kills a total of 11 people in a series of shootings southern Alabama Dec 2008 : A gunman dressed as Santa Claus kills nine people and himself on Christmas Eve in LA Sept 2008 : Six people die in a series of shootings in the north - west of Washington state June 2008 : A worker at a plastics plant in Kentucky kills five people before killing himself Apr 2007 : 32 people and the gunman die at the Virginia Tech campus
In pictures : Hostage drama A spokeswoman for Our Lady of Lourdes hospital told the BBC several people had been admitted with serious injuries .
The governor of New York state , David Paterson , said it had been " a tragic day for New York " .
" This is a horrible situation .
There 's actually no reason or excuse for this kind of shooting and brutal attack on innocent people right here in New York state , " he said .
Mr Paterson told a news conference there was " a profound sense of outrage at this senseless act of violence in which many innocent people were killed , injured and probably traumatised for some time to come " .
He said many of the victims were not from the US and police were in the process of contacting their families living abroad .
New York State would offer any assistance to the victims , who had " wanted to be part of the American dream and so tragically may have had that hope thwarted today " , said Mr Paterson .
" There still is an American dream and all of us who are Americans will try to heal this very , very deep wound in the city of Binghamton . "
Our correspondent said police were picking through evidence in the building trying to determine what had happened and why .
Bob Joseph of WNBF Radio told the BBC the town had never experienced an incident on such a scale before .
The ACA says on its website that it assists immigrants and refugees with personal and immigration counselling .

Many of you might be aware of comedian and actor Joe Rogan from the game show Fear Factor .
It is also widely known among fans about his experimentation with psychedelic drugs like DMT , which is a naturally - occuring tryptamine in the human body , a neurotransmitter some speculate plays a role in mediating the visual effects of natural dreaming , near - death experiences , religious visions , and other mystical states .
Joe Rogan has also shared a video regarding his isolation tank , a device originally researched by physician , psychoanalyst and philosopher John C. Lilly in the 1950s .
It was designed to test the effects of sensory deprivation on consciousness , and many find that this can replicate “ psychedelic - like ” experiences .
The basic idea behind an “ isolation tank ” is to cut your mind off from all your senses : vision , smell , touch , taste and touch .
This is achieved by submerging someone into a dark and quiet bath that is filled with salt ( so your body floats in the water ) .
Using this device , researchers can enter into altered states of consciousness even while not under the influence of any drugs .
However , some still mix the effects of the isolation tank with psychedelic drugs like LSD , psilocybin mushrooms , or cannabis .
The 1980 science fiction movie Altered States was based on some of John C. Lilly ’s research using isolation tanks with ketamine , a dissociative anesthesia , and LSD .
In the movie the man “ devolves ” back into an ape , but in the real world many psychonauts experiment with these kinds of methods to access different states of consciousness and possibly gain greater insight into themselves and reality .
In this other video you can find Joe Rogan giving away his old isolation tank and talking a little more about his experiences .
Please keep in mind that in most regions around the world having the possession of psychedelic drugs , as well as using them , can be a major criminal offense .
Isolation tanks , however , are completely legal ( as far as I know , you should probably double - check that before getting one ) .
There are three main things you need to consider when mimicking the effects of an isolation tank :
The water needs to be as close as possible to the temperature of your skin .
You need to put enough salt in the water so that your body floats without effort .
You need to do it in a space that is as quiet and dark as possible .
Keep in mind : the point is to be turning off your physical senses and focusing inwards .
Similar effects to isolation tanks and sensory deprivation can also be accomplished naturally through disciplined meditation practices .
For example : Tibetan Dream Yoga , which requires one to reach a kind of “ sensory deprivation ” by putting the body to sleep but still keeping your mind awake – this is essentially a wake - induced lucid dream ( WILD ) .
On a final note : I have never been one to tell someone how they should or should n’t treat their own body , as I believe we are each the sole authority over ourselves , and therefore we each reserve the right to choose what we consume or do n’t consume .
However , please keep in mind that there are some techniques in this article that may be frowned upon by various legal systems or societal values .
Please , use your own discretion and good judgment , and do your research before making any decision about your body or using an isolation tank .
Rape Culture Hysteria : Fixing the Damage Done to Men and Women
The Zero Decade Share
This :
What I did n't read was the breakdown into private vs. government jobs .
So with some digging at the
Seasonally adjusted :
month total nonfarm private government Dec 1999 130,532,000 109,992,000 20,540,000 Jun 2009 131,692,000 109,138,000 22,554,000 Change +1,160,000 - 854,000 +2,014,000
Now if you look at the seasonally adjusted data for 2009 ( or read the monthly news releases ) you 'll see that roughly half a million jobs are vanishing each month .
So it 's a safe bet that in six months we 'll see another 1.16 million jobs lost ... bringing the net for the decade to zero .
Probably minus .
However , if you look at private jobs , the change is already negative .
The only reason there are as many jobs now as ten years ago is because of the addition of two million government jobs .
Most of them during the Bush years , though Obama seems determined to continue the trend .
This is what they mean by " stimulus . "
More tax consumers .
Fewer tax payers .
You can see where this is going .
( Footnotes after the break . )
Note 2 : If you are inclined to distrust the " seasonal adjustment " , you 'll have to compare the unadjusted data for like months in 1999 and 2009 :
month total nonfarm private government Jun 1999 129,906,000 109,596,000 20,310,000 Jun 2009 132,609,000 110,098,000 22,511,000 Change +2,703,000 +502,000 +2,201,000

Note 1 : I acknowledge that these tables do n't reflect ( private ) farm employment .
On the other hand , I think some tax - paid jobs in health and education get categorized as " private " even though they should be considered government jobs .
It probably evens out in the end .

A week or so back I read in a few different places -- I think one was the 5 Minute Forecast -- the observation that the " Zero Decade , " or the " Noughts , " or whatever you call 2000 - 2009 , was going to be the Zero Decade in yet another way : at the current rate of job losses , U.S. employment in December 2009 will be unchanged from December 1999 .
That 's ten years with no net increase in jobs .
What I did n't read was the breakdown into private vs. government jobs .
So with some digging at the BLS web site I found the monthly numbers for " total nonfarm " vs. " total private " : Seasonally adjusted :
Now if you look at the seasonally adjusted data for 2009 ( or read the monthly news releases ) you 'll see that roughly half a million jobs are vanishing each month .

Ladies of Pittsburgh — if you 're looking for a new doctor to take care of your unmentionable parts , may I suggest not choosing the crazy Steelers fan who made a $ 69 bid on " The Price Is Right . "
I think this video combines everything that is wrong with America into one crazy stew that somehow comes out tasting delicious .
Let 's review all that is going on here .
The guy 's name is Dr. Bummer .
He 's a gynecologist .
He has a Steelers jersey that he personalized with his own name in the cheapest DIY way imaginable .
He chose to wear said jersey on national television .
He miraculously gets chosen to come on down and then decides to bid " 69 dollars " in the opening game .
And as the ultimate icing on the cake , he wins .
The only thing that could have made it better is if he had performed an ultrasound on the pregnant " Barker 's Beauty . "
( I still call them that . )

This is not a great advertisement for the state of Pennsylvania , the Steelers organization , or the field of gynecology , but it is pretty amusing .
Unfortunately , I think his malpractice insurance premiums are about to go through the roof .

For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness , because that which is known about God is evident within them ; for God made it evident to them .
For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes ,
His eternal power and divine nature , have been clearly seen , being understood through what has been made , so that they are without excuse .
For even though they knew God , they did not honor Him as God or give thanks , but they became futile in their speculations , and their foolish heart was darkened .
Professing to be wise , they became fools .
Romans 1:18 - 22
These verses were sent to me by a dear friend , in an attempt to shake me out of my unbelief .
The following is an excerpt from my response : I pondered this obtuse passage all day at work , trying to wrap my head around it .
From the passage I gather that God 's wrath is on constant display in some manner regarding sin and immorality .
In addition to that , his power and nature are supposed to be clearly evident .
Failure to recognize this has led to futility and some manner of moral decay .
Now , if you were asked to make observations about the world , and solely from these make a judgment about the character of it's overseer , what conclusions would you come to ?
In the natural world I see violence , starvation , extinction , and constant struggle for survival .
I see crippling diseases and pandemics , birth defects , and bitter fights among opposing species .
In the social world , I see the greedy and deceitful rise to power , the misappropriation of natural resources , pollution , and exploitation of the weak .
I see cruel treatment of others , murder , rape , tribalism , and war .
Beyond this , I see a pale blue dot .
A small planet orbiting a medium sized star on the edge of the Milky Way galaxy , one of billions in a vast sea black space .
What am I to gather about the nature of a deity who reveals himself in these things ?
From this I am to gather that the creator of so vast and majestic a universe is also highly concerned with the thoughts of a infinitesimally small speck and will damn the speck accordingly ?
That is a highly dubious claim .
Everything that can be gathered about the nature of God from observation alone is perfectly covered by Epicurius : " Is God willing to prevent evil , but not able ?
Then he is not omnipotent .
Is he able , but not willing ?
Then he is malevolent .
Is he both able and willing ?
Then whence cometh evil ?
Is he neither able nor willing ?
Then why call him God ? " .
So , I missed the boat on that one .
Now , assuming that I did actually pick up on all the obvious clues and suddenly understood God 's wrath , his invisible attributes , and divine nature , what use would I have for scripture ?
If everything necessary for the understanding of God is evident within me already and obvious in everything around me , of what use are pages of dietary restrictions , schematics for a mobile temple , tedious genealogies , etc . ?
I supposedly have an understanding of his nature so encompassing as to leave me without excuse , but he still thought it necessary to remind me that I should not commit murder ?
Why evangelize if the masses of unsaved are already in possession of the knowledge necessary to be reconciled to God ?
In fact , if this perfect morality and nature is so evident , why is Paul even bothering to write to the Romans at all ?
What a terrible imposition upon your friends to write a lengthy letter full of things they all already know .
Again , obtuse .
Futility .
I 'll have to admit , this one irks me to no end .
What self righteousness !
To make such astounding claims about the nature of God , without even a shred of supporting evidence , then assert that these claims are just plain obvious , Q.E.D. , is bad enough .
To then go on to accuse those who have not been convinced , by this absurdly sophomoric line of non-reason , of being futile in their speculations is intellectual cowardice .
It is a moral responsibility to examine the claims of any belief system .
How valid are these claims ?
What is the historic origin of them ?
Do the claims line up with what we can prove about the world around us ?
If so , are there other explanations ?
What are the real world consequences of these beliefs ?
Not only should I question the belief system , but considering the sum of human misery that has resulted from these beliefs , it is a moral duty to question them .
This is the polar opposite of futility .
Paul 's smug certainty smacks of obscurantism , which is exactly what one would expect from a charismatic cult leader .
The problem with this passage is that the collected stories , beliefs , customs , and moralities of a Bronze Age desert tribe are not obvious at all .
These are one culture 's first , best guess at why we are here and what we should do .
None of the assertions about God that are made in the Bible are obvious with any amount of natural observation .
They are simply claims , just like the ones in the Koran , the Book of Mormon , the Upanishads , and Dianetics by L. Ron Hubbard .
Being able to recognize this does not make my thinking futile , and my morality , in practical terms , has grown stronger since I became an apostate .
Referees are more likely to award points to a competitor dressed in red ( Image : Ezra Shaw / Getty )
Editorial : Red alert
IMAGINE you are an experienced martial arts referee .
You are asked to score a number of taekwondo bouts , shown to you on video .
In each bout , one combatant is wearing red , the other blue .
Would clothing colour make any difference to your impartial , expert judgement ?
Of course it would n’t .
Yet research shows it almost certainly would .
Last year , sports psychologists at the University of Münster , Germany , showed video clips of bouts to 42 experienced referees .
They then played the same clips again , digitally manipulated so that the clothing colours were swapped round .
The result ?
In close matches , the scoring swapped round too , with red competitors awarded an average of 13 per cent more points than when they were dressed in blue ( Psychological Science , vol 19 , p 769 ) .
“ If one competitor is strong and the other weak , it wo n’t change the outcome of the fight , ” says Norbert Hagemann , who led the study .
“ But the closer the levels , the easier it is for the colour to tip the scale . ”
This is just the latest piece of research suggesting that exposure to certain colours can have a significant effect on how people think and act .
Up to now most of the research has focused on red clothing in sport , but other colours and settings are being investigated too .
It is becoming clear that colours can have an important , unappreciated effect on the way your mind works – one that you really ought to know about .
The powerful influence of colour on sporting success …
Message or culture ?
Message or culture ?
UU World Magazine , published by the Unitarian Universalist Association
Every year , the Unitarian Universalist Association ’s General Assembly takes on some unannounced theme .
Or at least I think it does .
Maybe it ’s just my mind ’s unconscious habit of imposing order on the buzzing , blooming confusion of it all .
But each year the talks I go to , the people I run into , the random blips of conversation I overhear all seem to point to some idea or issue or question that I did n’t think I was thinking about when I got there .
This year , it all seemed to point to this :
At its core , what is Unitarian Universalism really about ?
Do we have a message we are trying to bring to the world ?
Or do we have a culture we are trying to preserve against extinction ?
In one of the Thursday workshops at GA , the Rev. Dr. Mark Morrison - Reed , an African - American minister and historian , opened a talk called “ The Perversity of Diversity ” by describing the churches he could see in his Toronto neighborhood : two Korean churches , a Ukrainian Catholic church , a Lutheran Slovak church , and a Jehovah ’s Witness Kingdom Hall advertising services in Portuguese .
“ Where does your congregation fit into this ethnic mix ? ” he asked .
“ You do n’t know .
You do n’t think of yourself as an ethnic congregation .
I ’ve got news for you .
You are . ”
( See UU World ’s profile of Morrison - Reed in the Spring 2009 issue . )
He was n’t just talking about our race ( “ 97.5 percent Euro - American ” ) or language ( English ) , but also our class ( professional as opposed to working ) , education ( just short of a master ’s degree , on average ) , regional heritage ( New England ) , and worship style ( “ no ‘ Amens ’ here ” ) .
One of Morrison ’s questioners noted that his southern church was made up largely of transplanted northerners :
Even the local English - speaking white population was too culturally distant .
The previous day , in her response to the Rev. Dr. Paul Rasor ’s Berry Street Lecture ( which was technically part of Ministry Days rather than GA , but nobody was checking badges when I walked in ) , another African - American UU minister , the Rev. Rosemary Bray McNatt , could have been preaching from the same text .
“ We forget when we talk about cultural change in ministry , ” she said , “ that it is not just those other people who have a culture . ”
She poked fun at some stereotypic UU traits : liking PBS and NPR but denouncing all other mass media , shopping at farmer ’s markets while avoiding Wal - Mart , listening to classical music rather than gospel or hip - hop .
But the humor faded when she wondered whether her son will be a UU in adulthood .
He loves our message , but questions whether he can share our culture .
Will he ever feel like he belongs ?
Are we bringing a message to the world , or preserving a culture ?
It makes a difference .
If we ’re bringing a message to the world , we ’re not doing very well .
Not much of the world is listening .
Some of our churches are growing while others are shrinking , but nowhere are we spreading like the yeast in Jesus ’s parable of the leaven .
If we ’re preserving a culture , on the other hand , we ’re doing fine .
Our numbers are holding reasonably steady while other liberal or mainstream denominations shrink .
( A 2006 report by Presbyterian researcher Perry Chang showed declines in the top seven mainstream Protestant denominations , with the United Church of Christ — our closest cousin historically — losing about one - third of its membership between 1994 and 2004 . )
Just about anyplace that a stereotypic UU would want to live for very long — a major city or a bucolic college town , say — has a UU church where our people can find refuge against the storms of ignorance and intolerance ( or just bad taste ) raging outside its walls .
“ We are an ethnic faith , ” Morrison - Reed repeated several times .
Was that an observation , or a taunt ?
With the McNatt / Morrison - Reed words ringing in my head , I listened to the UUA ’s presidential race differently .
The Peter Morales T - shirts said : “ We can be the religion for our time . ”
But I began to hear an unstated challenge — or was it also a taunt ?— at the end of that line : if we want to .
We might not want to .
If we ’re really going to have this discussion , we need to give that possibility its due .
By describing the churches of his neighborhood , Morrison - Reed was implicitly pointing out that there ’s nothing inherently wrong with an ethnic church .
There are lots of them , and why should n’t the Slovak Lutherans have a church of their own ?
Our partner churches in Transylvania , he observed , would understand perfectly :
They ’re Hungarian - speaking Unitarian Christians who preserved their ways through half a century of rule by Romanian - speaking atheists .
What ’s wrong with that ?
Nothing .
This is n’t a good - versus - evil issue ; it ’s a question of what kind of good we want to pursue .
There ’s nothing wrong with wanting to feel comfortable in church , wanting to feel affirmed in your identity , wanting to see and hear and do familiar things with people like yourself .
But if that kind of good starts to crowd out other kinds of good , we need to make choices .
Gustav Niebuhr was also at GA , accepting the Melcher Book Award for Beyond Tolerance .
His book is about interfaith dialogue , but it has a subtext about identity .
The dialogue he celebrates does not demonize identity .
It does not ask people of diverse faiths to airbrush away their differences or compromise on some vapid set of universal principles .
Quite the opposite , it calls for people to be secure enough in their identities that they can listen deeply to each other without feeling threatened .
I had no trouble fitting his message into the theme I was hearing in ( or imposing on ) General Assembly as a whole :
It would serve no purpose to demonize the UU stereotype .
We do n’t need to hide our advanced degrees , stop listening to NPR , or watch NASCAR or hip - hop videos instead of Bill Moyers Journal .
We ’re never going to become cultureless or identity - free .
But perhaps if we go deeper we can reach the bedrock of our UU identities , and recognize that many of our common traits are not really necessary .
To steal Theodore Parker ’s evocative terminology , perhaps we can separate the transient from the permanent in Unitarian Universalist culture .
If I were making a novel out of General Assembly and could arrange its events in any order I like , the story would culminate in the “ Guess Who ’s Coming to Worship ? ” talk that in fact happened on Friday evening , with two days of the conference to go .
The Euro - American minister of All Souls Unitarian Church in Tulsa , the Rev. Marlin Lavanhar , shared a podium ( as he has shared a pulpit ) with African - American preacher the Rev. Carlton Pearson .
Pearson was once a Pentecostal bishop , a regent of Oral Roberts University , and the leader of a 6,000 - member Tulsa megachurch whose services were televised on the Trinity network .
Part of Pearson ’s story was already familiar to many UUs , because NPR’s This American Life centered an entire episode on him in 2005 .
In 2001 he had a religious experience that ( from a UU point of view ) sounds a lot like something John Murray or Hosea Ballou might have preached about :
God told him that no one was going to Hell .
All the doctrine about God taking out his anger on Jesus instead of us — it was just wrong .
God was never angry , and has always loved us .
As soon as he started talking about this new insight , Pearson fell from favor in the Pentecostal world .
His congregation dwindled .
They lost their building , bounced around a little , and then last summer started meeting at All Souls — and drawing a number of curious UUs to their services .
By the fall , Pearson had recommended his flock join All Souls , and Lavanhar had crafted a Sunday program where the church ’s two services had the same UU sermon and readings , but the late service had a more Pentecostal worship style , with livelier music and more amens .
“ It ’s not our norm , ” Lavanhar explained to his congregation , “ but there ’s nothing about who we are or our values that says we can ’t . ”
( Watch for the Fall 2009 issue of UU World later in August for a cover story about Pearson , Lavanhar , and All Souls . )
All Souls is n’t changing its message , in other words , but it is trying to change its culture .
For the rest of the conference , I heard people buzzing :
Is that really possible ?
What if it works ?
Could it happen at my church ?
What would we gain ?
What would we lose ?
Saturday , during the question period of another workshop , Morrison - Reed was asked what UUism might look like in twenty years .
“ In Tulsa , ” he answered , “ if it succeeds in merging the fervor of Pentecostal culture — and the emotion — with the UU message , I ca n’t tell you what we might be in twenty years .
If we can merge true , honest emotion with liberal religion — and they are not contradictory , in spite of what some people believe — I ca n’t tell you what we will look like .
It will be vastly different . ”
If that starts to happen , if we are going into a cyclone period where things become “ vastly different , ” it will be tempting to hold on for dear life .
There ’s nothing wrong with that reflex .
It is in fact a virtue — if we hold on to the right things .
If we hold onto the permanent in Unitarian Universalism and let the transient blow away , we will come out stronger .
But if we hold onto the transient , the cyclone will scatter us across the landscape .
Now we just need to figure out which is which .

Something fishy seems to be going on at Harvard :
The university is trying to be hip , possibly even chic .
How else to explain Harvard ’s cameo on this week ’s episode of NYC Prep ?
And its new men ’s fashion line , Harvard Yard ?
And by fashion line , we do n’t mean maroon sweatshirts with crests on them .
The university has inked a ten - year licensing deal with clothing manufacturer Wearwolf Group for a line of contemporary men ’s apparel .
It ’s unclear if the line is part of the university ’s attempt to stop bleeding money .
Harvard Yard — a lawn we imagine makes a nice resting ground for Harvard students to repair glasses , wipe down their pocket protectors , and memorize an extra few digits of pi — inspired the spring collection .
The line includes “ short - sleeve plaid shirts , Liberty print wovens , seersucker shorts , regimental stripes , sporty knits , patterned jackets and fancy pants — all in a contemporary , tapered fit , ” according to WWD .
The clothes wo n’t be very Harvard -y in the literal sense .
“ Harvard ” only appears on the labels inside the garments , while the university ’s signature crimson only appears in buttonholes , zipper pulls , and other trimmings .
Prices range from $ 165 for pants to $ 495 for sport coats .
The line ’s creative director , John Fowler , told WWD that designers drew from photos of students lounging in Harvard Yard in the sixties .
“ It ’s a style that has become current again and not just with the American consumer .
We think Harvard Yard will have global appeal . ”
So the fashion of Harvard could , one day , have the same reach as Gucci or Prada or … the Gap .
But will Harvard students go for it ?
The line is mostly targeted to alums and “ fans ” of the university , which have no doubt multiplied exponentially since the school ’s Bravo debut this week .
But the line ’s creators do n’t offer any solutions to Harvard Yard ’s inherent problem : Fashion and Harvard just do n’t go together .
Would you give a child an Oreo and a glass of Dr Pepper to dip it in ?
Probably not .
That said , apparently a market exists in Massachusetts for the pink - whale foam hats and sailboat belts by the epically preppy Vineyard Vines , so there is probably a market for this , too .
And , terrifyingly , whoever buys it will likely accessorize with the Vineyard Vines Harvard ivy tie .

Colin Montgomerie Defeats Pirates
The final warmup to the British Open , the Barclays Scottish Open , is taking place at Loch Lomond this weekend .
Many of the top contenders are there , including Scotland ’s own Colin Montgomerie .
The fan favorite took the course yesterday as part of the pro-am .
Just offshore on the loch , a wily band of pirates had commandeered a ship .
Well , maybe it was a speedboat .
And instead of commandeering , they probably rented it .
Whatever the case , the men in pirate garb hung a target out over the side and challenged Monty to hit it .
Never one to pass up a challenge , Colin Montgomerie unleashed a mighty wallop and nailed the target from 60 - yarrrrrrrds away .
The pirates rejoiced in their defeat and presumably went somewhere to do more drinking , while Montgomerie celebrated and hoped his good luck would continue through the rest of this month .
Now about that divot he ripped out of the green …

NEW YORK - A New York City woman who says she can't find a job is suing the college where she earned a bachelor 's degree .
Trina Thompson filed a lawsuit last week against Monroe College in Bronx Supreme Court .
The 27 - year - old is seeking the $ 70,000 she spent on tuition .
Thompson says she 's been unable to find gainful employment since she received her information technology degree in April .
She says the Bronx school 's Office of Career Advancement has n't provided her with the leads and career advice it promises .
Monroe College spokesman Gary Axelbank says Thompson 's lawsuit is completely without merit .
The college insists it helps its graduates find jobs .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) -
The tallest building in the Western Hemisphere will undergo a $ 350 million “ green ” retrofit that its owners said on Wednesday will make the 110 - story office tower a beacon for environmentally sound space .
The Sears Tower is shown in this aerial view of Chicago July 6 , 2006 .
REUTERS / Jason Reed
Plans call for the 1,450 - foot Sears Tower to reduce its electricity consumption by 80 percent and water usage by 40 percent .
It will be renamed the Willis tower later this summer in a deal with new tenant global insurance broker Willis Group Holdings .
To achieve the savings , owner American Landmark Properties and its partners plan to :
- Replace the 1973 tower ’s 16,000 tinted single - pane windows and create a “ thermal break ” between Chicago ’s frigid winters and hot summers and the interior .
- Install gas boilers equipped with fuel cells , which generate electricity , heat and cooling .
- Revamp the tower ’s 104 elevators and 15 escalators to cut their electricity usage by 40 percent .
- Conserve 24 million gallons of water with new restroom fixtures and “ condensation capture . ”
- “ Harvest daylight ” by installing systems that automatically dim lighting based on available natural light .
- Install solar panels to heat water .
- Erect wind turbines on building setbacks , if possible .
- Plant green roofs that will be among the highest in the world to reduce storm runoff and the urban heat island effect .
- Replace granite plazas and walls surrounding the tower with terraced park space , trees , glass storefronts and an interactive digital display .
“ We hope to set a benchmark for how high - rise buildings throughout the world can limit their impact on the environment , ” said architect Adrian Smith in a statement .
Beyond that , the consortium that owns the tower proposed constructing an adjacent hotel that would qualify for the federal LEED ( Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design ) designation .
I love point - and - click adventures as much as the next person .
Actually , that hoary old platitude is an outright lie , in this case ; I love them a great deal more than the next person , assuming of course that I am not standing next to Ron Gilbert .
Anyway , it 's a great time to be me , or someone like me , or like Ron Gilbert , because there are quite a few excellent point - and - clicks from a variety of different creators .
There 's Telltale 's new episodic Monkey Island games that kicked off earlier this week .
There 's the remake of the original Monkey Island on Xbox Live next week .
LucasArts has also re-released several classic games on Steam .
But I have n't actually played any of those yet .
What I 've been sinking my capacity for item - based puzzle solving into is a pair of adventures called Ben There , Dan That ! and Time Gentlemen , Please !
Created by a small indie team , these two games are professional , polished productions all the way through .
While the free - of - charge first game does have some rough edges and is not especially complex or lengthy , the $ 5 sequel is every bit as detailed , internally consistent , funny , and engaging as the best output of classic - era Lucas or Sierra .
Andrew Vestal 's raves about the game , specifically its profane , unapologetically British , pitch - perfect comedy writing , got me into the series .
Although you do n't have to play Ben There , Dan That before Time Gentlemen , I 'd recommend it – the first game is free , and though not quite as awesome as the second , it 's still well worth playing through .
But Time Gentlemen , Please is the indie masterpiece , a point - and - click that loves the genre it 's in .
The writers do poke fun at the conventions of the genre from time to time , and occasionally make casual reference to the classic games that inspired them , but it 's not a complete and total shattering of the fourth wall .
The puzzles are mostly fair – there were a couple things that I 'd have changed about Ben There , but Time Gentlemen has a better hint system in case you do n't know what you 're supposed to be doing .
And there are some puzzles , particularly the ones that use mini - games that play off of text adventures and text - based point - and - click game mechanics , that really impressed me .
These games are n't just a casual " hey , let 's make a point - and - click like Lucas used to " diversion for these designers – they truly understand how to exploit the genre 's strengths .
American journalists Euna Lee and Laura Ling have been arrested in North Korea since March .
A few days ago , former United States president Bill Clinton went to North Korea , obtained a special pardon for them , and brought them back home to America .

July 21 , 2009  --
If there were a contest for cutest animal on the planet , the lemur would be a strong contender .
But cuteness alone can't save the creatures from the political forces threatening their existence , especially not the illegal loggers destroying the lemurs ' precious rainforest habitat .
Lemurs are small primates that are endemic to Madagascar and are not found living in nature outside the island nation in the Indian Ocean off the southeastern coast of Africa .
There are nearly 100 different species of lemurs , including the black and white lemur , the ring - tail lemur , the tiny mouse lemur and even the mischievous dancing lemur .
" Nightline 's " Dan Harris visited a lemur park about 15 miles outside Antananarivo , the capital city , where he got to know these impish little animals and saw , firsthand , the emerging threats to their survival .
Watch " Nightline " tonight at 11:35 ET for the full story .
A recent military coup in the impoverished , unstable country left a power vacuum that has allowed heavily armed illegal loggers , known as the " timber mafia , " to pillage the lemur 's natural habitat .
One of the forests is the Marojejy National Park , a towering , dauntingly beautiful landscape reminiscent of a set from " Jurassic Park . "
A few weeks ago , the forest in northeastern Madagascar had largely been taken over by looters and had to be shut down .
Marojejy is also home to one of the most rare and beautiful lemurs of all , the silky sifaka .
Between 100 to 1,000 of these animals are left on earth .
White as snow , the sifakas look like cotton balls with tails .
Humans who want to see the sifakas in the wild must make a long , slippery trek through humid , leech - infested forests .
Their remote forest habitat keeps them safe from natural predators , but it offers little protection from the more dire threat of human encroachment .
Madagascar 's Precious Wilderness at ' Risk Every Day , ' Conservationist Says
Niall O'Connor , who works for The World Wildlife Fund , which has been on red alert for the lemurs since the coup in March , said lemurs ' survival is completely dependent on the survival of the forest .
If the forests disappear , he said , " That 's it , they 're gone .
And that 's why we have to protect them . "
And it 's not just the silky sifakas that are in danger .
The coup also created an opening for what has been described as " open and organized plundering " of other animals , including Madagascar 's endangered tortoises , which have been poached and illegally sold into the pet trade .
There are 11,000 species of animals and plants that exist only in Madagascar , and could be in danger if their habitats are depleted .
Madagascar broke off of continental Africa about 160 million years ago , and the geographic isolation has led to extraordinary wildlife , from rare tree frogs to huge millipedes to brilliantly camouflaged lizards .
" It is just simply one of those unique places on earth , " O'Connor said .
" It 's at risk every day . "
After the coup in March , the timber mafia , long influential in Madagascar , went into overdrive , exacerbating the long - running problem of illegal logging .
Conservation groups say that gangs of organized criminals intimidated forest guards , burned down government offices and built roads deep into national parks to extract rosewood trees .
This wood is used to make expensive furniture and musical instruments , and conservationists suspect much of it is going to China .
The poaching got so bad that the looters actually solicited workers on the radio .
" They were saying that we 'll be in such and such a place , in such and such a time and if you have timber we 'll buy it , or if you know where there 's more timber , let us know .
...
It was very brazen , " O'Connor said .
Sources in the conservation and diplomatic communities say they suspect that government officials may actually be taking bribes to help the timber mafia .
The government denies this claim , saying it has sent in troops to crack down on illegal loggers .
In recent weeks , the pace of the illegal logging has slowed somewhat , but as long as the political situation remains uncertain , so does the future of the lemurs .
Among conservationists , there 's still real fear that this most rare and beautiful primate will disappear in the not too distant future ... another victim of the most dangerous primate on earth : man .
Pretty simple ( and disturbing ) :
Oh , oh yes , do watch this video from Claire McCaskill ’s town hall yesterday .
Old serial killer - ish guy just gets up from the bleachers , STEALS the black lady ’s poster of Rosa Parks that she ’d been showing a reporter , rips and crumples it up , cops chase ‘em all out , and everyone boos the black lady .
Raw Democracy !
Non-spoiler comment :
Go see it , it ’s good .
Not brilliant if you ’ve read any science fiction where the math works , but good nonetheless .
Spoilers after the break …
Okay , so first , perspective .
Go watch a bad movie or a popcorn movie and afterwards you either think “ that was fun ” or “ that sucked ” .
There ’s no fine detail , no nitpicking , because a movie has to get above a certain threshold of intelligence before you go from “ gah , this sucks ” to “ that would n’t work because … ” .
Moon makes it past that threshold .
The problem is , it then does n’t commit fully in the setup of the story , and it out - and - out chickens out completely from logic in the last few minutes to give a Disney ending .
The good news is that at least some of the obvious gaffes are easily overlookable as being constraints imposed by filming rather than mistakes per se .
The gravity , for example , is never portrayed as being less than Earth ’s all through the film , and while that ’s not jarring inside the habitation modules of the moonbase , it ’s very obvious when watching the scenes set on the surface , and there ’s a lot of those scenes for visual effect ( and yes , they ’re very pretty , just not very real – it ’s like looking at a painting of a unicorn ) .
The bad news is that the other mistakes range all over the place from fundamental – the economics of the setup do n’t work – to visual – we ’re treated to loving - yet - impossible shots of the earth hanging in the star - studded sky .
Actually , in at least one shot , the Earth is so large that the moon would need to be approaching if not inside the Roche limit , which would make for a visually interesting ending if nothing else …
Some of the gaffes are against even basic common sense .
Our protagonists , for example .
A single man , supervising a large and complicated and rather important mining operation , all on his own for three years ?
There are several reasons that kind of thing is n’t even considered in the real world , ranging from psychological ( we do n’t even subject our worst prisoners to solitary confinement for that long ) to pragmatic ( he could fall down and hit his head and then the entire operation is stuffed until ( and unless ) he recovers ) to efficiency - based ( no - one can monitor a complex operation 24/ 7 for three years , so you work in shifts with other people ) .
It certainly sounds very science fiction - like , but good science fiction does n’t require the suspension of all common sense and whole bodies of hard - learnt information .
The actual mining operation itself , harvesting Helium - 3 from the moon , is n’t beyond the bounds of feasibility ( it ’s been a well - explored and studied idea since the 1970s ) .
And the harvesting is portrayed well , raking in the top few inches of regolith instead of tunneling into the moon , so someone at least read up on how the He3 got there in the first place ; it ’s just a pity that they did n’t continue to read to find out that it makes more economic sense to go to the gas giants if you ’re harvesting He3 for use on Earth .
And there ’s even mention of a project in Jovian space in the background of the story , so the mistake is compounded by there already being an existing , far more lucrative source of He3 available in the story ’s universe .
The harvesters themselves are also one of the visually jarring elements – they throw their processed regolith back up and over in great plumes of material , but the arcs the material follows are the ones you see when you throw something in Earth gravity , not lunar gravity .
The whole setup does n’t behave as it would on the moon .
The obligatory intelligent robot is of course present in the story , here voiced by Kevin Spacey which is a surprisingly bizarre touch , but even more bizarre are the smiley faces used by the robot to portray its emotional states .
I do wonder if the folks who write these stories ever consider that if we could build a robot able to perform complex tasks autonomously ; engage in conspiracies to the point of murdering a dozen or more human beings ; deceive someone for three years while in continuous proximity to him ; empathise with individual people to the point of countermanding instructions given to it by other people ; and so forth , that the very first application of such a robot would be to run the mining operation itself .
No humans on - site means no need for food , air , water and so forth .
On that point , when and how do the shipments of food arrive ?
It ’s all preprocessed and prepackaged food , not food grown as part of an enclosed life support system .
Where are the large numbers of plants you need to recycle the air in the habitation modules ( the few “ pet ” plants we see are nowhere near enough ) ?
Where are all the disposable resources we see being consumed coming from and where are they being resupplied from and how is contact with those bringing the supplies being prevented without arousing our protagonist ’s suspicions or those of those delivering the supplies ?
There are nice points supporting the plot , but they too fall down when considered .
For example , the base is shown above the regolith right from the start , and the first question anyone would ask is how they shield it from radiation during solar activity .
However , as one of our protagonists rapidly dies from end - stage radiation poisoning , and as we see in the video logs accessed towards the end of the story all of his predecessors doing the same thing , it seems the company simply felt that spending a few hours with a shovel was too much time and money to spend on keeping our presumably rather expensive clones alive .
And that ’s a point in and of itself .
In the basement where the clones are kept , fully grown in morgue - like drawers and somehow preserved ( unaging ) complete with personal effects sans refrigeration , there are easily a hundred clones .
That ’s a hundred people each weighing around 160 lb .
That ’s a monumentally expensive weight to haul up from earth – remember an Apollo launch cost around five to ten billion in today ’s money to put two people on the moon ; the new Constellation programme ’s cost is estimated to be around about one to two billion for four people which is cheaper but nonetheless , that ’s still going to come to somewhere between five and seventy billion to stock that basement .
You ’d imagine that the extra fifty thousand or so to bring up a shovel might be worth it .
Or even just park the harvesters near the base and have them throw regolith over it .
And yes , I suppose in the story you could grow the clones at the base , but you ’d still have to ship in the organic compounds found in human tissues , because you ca n’t find those on the moon .
And we ’ve still not mentioned how much the food for all those people must weigh .
We know , incidentally , that we ’re not feeding the corpses back to the next clone because ( a ) they ’re all dying of radiation poisoning so the meat will only kill the next clone faster ( as in , a few days to a few weeks ) , ( b ) 160 lb of meat wo n’t feed one guy for three years , ( c ) they flash - incinerate the clones in the end anyway .
The flash - incinerator is an bit of a plot hole in that if you ’re stuck somewhere for 3 years on your own in a confined space , to assume you wo n’t examine in detail the piece of equipment that gets you home is asking a lot to be assumed .
And the kind of equipment you ’d need to flash - incinerate a human body to dust in under two seconds is not going to look the same as the equipment you ’d need to cryogenically freeze them .
Not to mention that sooner or later some clone is going to question the idea that a three day trip is so ardous that you need to be cryogenically frozen to withstand it ( especially since Apollo showed how it was n’t actually all that hard … ) .
And we ’ve not even blinked at the magic that gives us fully - grown adult clones without the usual thirty - year wait , and the memory implants …
All of these plot holes , however , would be minor ones if the story had n’t chickened out at the end .
The entire setup , the panopticon of the moonbase , the oversight of the robot and the company , the incoming “ rescue team ” , all of it points towards a bad end for our hero , but he manages to escape to Earth , lets the next clone contact Earth directly , and testifies in court to bring charges against the company and annoy right - wing crackpot radio hosts .
Hooray .
Except that that ’s a purely Disney ending which is n’t in any way consistent with the story to that point .
In fact , what he ’s done is to awaken a new clone who is now doomed – the rescue squad will spot the downed jamming beacon and kill the clone before he can call home just to tidy up possible loose ends ; and our protagonist meanwhile has killed himself by climbing into a small rocket designed to return a cargo of inert gas to Earth – meaning that he ’ll die inside it , either when the rocket fails to make lunar escape velocity due to his weight , or when the rocket burns up in Earth ’s atmosphere due to there being no control surfaces to adjust for his weight , or when the rocket crashes because the parachutes are n’t big enough to cope with his weight , or just from asphyxiation when his air runs out a few hours into the month - long low - energy trip from the moon to the earth .
And that ’s not even mentioning being actively intercepted by the company , against whom he is a witness in at least a dozen calculated murders .
And that ’s the real disappointment of Moon .
The rest , the plot holes and gimmicks and errors , you could overlook if the film had just taken the twin assumptions it makes , of a company who has no compunction at premeditated murder for profit and an intelligent and skilled but isolated person who finds they ’re next on the list ; and followed that through to the logical conclusion .
That ending would have made Moon a classic entry into both the film noir and science fiction genres , and there are a number of ways such an ending could have gone , from the embracing of moral ambiguity ( kill all the clones by throwing their bodies out onto the regolith , thus allowing a deal to be struck with the company ) ; to embracing the helplessness of the protagonists ( by seeing them killed off and replaced by the next clone ) ; to seeking the “ clever ” ending ( our protagonist has more than enough resources and training at his disposal to jury - rig a means to kill the “ rescue team ” thus buying him enough time to awaken all of the clones to seek a longer - term solution ) .
Instead , it portrays the protagonist as valiant hero , and despite taking the plot element of the countdown to the arrival of the “ rescue team ” from Outland and High Noon before it , it fails to give the protagonist the motivations that Connory and Cooper ’s characters had to remain to face the antagonists alone as he does .
It ’s rather sad really , it was a pretty good story up until the director threw it away .
That ’s the problem with most of these movies – the ending of the story is a cop-out .
Almost all the really good films over the last fifty years have in common the practice of not chickening out on the ending , of seeing where the story is really leading to .
From Primer and Blade Runner to Educating Rita , the really good films follow a story even if it has a dark , immoral or tragic ending ( and yes , Educating Rita has a tragic ending , because it ’s a tragedy whose protagonist is Frank , not Rita ) .
( CNN ) --
Investigators have heard a signal from the flight data recorders of the Yemenia Airways plane that crashed last week , they announced Sunday .
Search parties continue their operation to locate the Yemenia Airbus A310 off the Comoros Islands Saturday .
" A signal was picked up from two acoustic transmitters from the plane 's flight data recorders during a sea search to locate the data recorders this morning , " the French air accident investigation agency , known as the BEA , said in a statement .
Commonly known as " black boxes , " the data recorders should contain information to help determine what caused the crash .
The Yemenia Airways Airbus 310 crashed into the Indian Ocean early Tuesday , carrying 142 passengers and 11 crew members .
It originated in Yemen 's capital , Sanaa , and went down just miles from Moroni , the capital of the Comoros Islands .
One person , a 13 - year - old French girl , survived .
Bahia Basari , who lives in Marseille , escaped with cuts to her face and a fractured collarbone .
Watch teen survivor from crash »
The teen 's father , Kassim Bakari , told a French radio network that his wife and daughter were flying to Comoros to visit relatives .
" When I had her on the phone , I asked her what happened and she said , ' Daddy , I do n't know what happened , but the plane fell into the water and I found myself in the water ... surrounded by darkness .
I could not see anyone , ' " Bakari told France Info .
The head of the rescue team in the Comoros told French radio RTL that the teenager beat astonishing odds to survive .
" It is truly , truly , miraculous , " Ibrahim Abdoulazeb said .
" The young girl can barely swim . "
Another rescuer told France 's Europe 1 radio that the girl was spotted in the rough sea , among bodies and plane debris in darkness , about two hours after the crash .
The Airbus 310 plane tried to land at the airport in Moroni , then made a U - turn before it crashed , Comoros Vice President Idi Nadhoim said soon after the accident .
A French official said the nation had banned the plane after it failed an aviation inspection in 2007 .
" Since this check - up , we have not seen the plane reappearing in France , " said Dominique Bussereau , the transport minister .
But Yemenia Airlines was not on the European Union 's list of banned airlines , he added .
Passengers on the flight included 66 French citizens , 54 Comorians , one Palestinian and one Canadian , according to Yemeni and French officials .
The crew was made up of six Yemenis , two Moroccans , one Ethiopian , one Filipino and one Indonesian .
The Comoros Islands are between the east African country of Tanzania and the island nation of Madagascar .

If you want an English broadcast of the U.S. - Mexico World Cup soccer qualifier on Aug. 12 , it 's not going to be as easy as flipping on ESPN .
Whether you have Comcast , Dish Network or DirecTV , you 'll probably have to buy a Latino programming package for the month of August and then cancel it .
The snafu comes at a time of heightened interest in the U.S. team , an increase that has helped fuel antagonism between Telemundo and ESPN .
Telemundo , which holds the rights to the Mexican national team 's home games , announced Monday that it will broadcast the 1 p.m. game from Mexico City 's Azteca Stadium in Spanish on its main channel and in English on mun2 ( " mun-dos " ) , an English - language channel geared toward young Latinos in the United States .
According to Nielsen Media Research , mun2 is currently in 31 million homes , about half the coverage of Telemundo .
In the Bay Area , mun2 is found on Channel 607 on Comcast , 410 on DirecTV and 838 on Dish Network .
An informed source said ESPN wanted to buy the English - language rights , but Telemundo set a price " way higher than reasonable . "
During World Cup qualifying in 2001 and ' 05 , the same situation occurred , but ESPN was able to negotiate for the English rights to the U.S. - Mexico qualifier .
The difference then was that the U.S. Soccer Federation was a partner with both Telemundo and ESPN .
In 2007 , U.S. Soccer switched to another Spanish - language network , Univision .
In retaliation , the source said , Telemundo played hardball in the English - language negotiations .
Telemundo spokesman Alfredo Richard would n't discuss negotiations with ESPN or any other broadcaster .
" We 've had the rights to this game for a while , " he said .
" We 're going with the strategy of broadcasting it on our platforms . "
Telemundo's parent company is NBC Universal , but Richard said there are no plans " at this time " to broadcast the game on an NBC outlet such as USA Network or Bravo .
ESPN spokesman Mac Nwulu declined to comment on the network 's failure to land the rights .
U.S. Soccer spokesman Neil Buethe would n't discuss the negotiations either .
" With every game , our objective is to provide the broadcast to the widest audience possible , both in English and Spanish , " he said .
" We do n't have the rights to televise this match , nor do our partners at ESPN . "
Fans also might watch the game at a sports bar or on an Internet feed .
Last week , Julio Cesar Godoy was a congressman - elect .
This week , he is a fugitive .
Mexican authorities say Godoy , a half - brother of Michoacan state Gov. Leonel Godoy , helped provide protection for La Familia , the drug - trafficking gang that has waged war on federal police across the state in recent days , killing at least 16 officers .
Officials have an arrest warrant but apparently can’t find the younger Godoy , an attorney who was elected to Congress on July 5 as a candidate of the left - leaning Democratic Revolution Party , or PRD .
Feeling political heat , Gov. Godoy on Wednesday called on his sibling to turn himself in and confront the accusations .
Godoy said his half - brother lived in a modest house , drove a used Volkswagen and showed no signs of links to organized crime .
The two last spoke weeks ago , the governor said .
“ He has to present his evidence if he is innocent , ” Godoy said in a radio interview .
“ If he is guilty , let them punish him with the full weight of the law . ”
The younger Godoy has not been seen in public since the campaign closed July 1 .
He did n’t show up to vote on election day nor , after his victory , to collect the official notification that he had been elected to Congress .
Authorities , who did not specify when the arrest order was granted , announced the allegations Tuesday as part of the investigation into a string of attacks in Michoacan against federal police officers since Saturday .
The attacks , including the slayings of 12 federal officers whose bodies were dumped near a highway , appeared to be in retaliation for the arrest of Arnoldo Rueda Medina , described as one of the gang ’s top three figures .
Officials say Saul Solis , a failed Green Party candidate for Congress , is also being sought for his alleged role as liaison between the crime group and officials and businessmen in Michoacan .
The allegations add new force to concerns over how thoroughly drug traffickers have infiltrated Mexico ’s political system , especially in smuggling crossroads such as Michoacan .
“ Cartels like La Familia are born , grow and reproduce thanks to narco - politics , thanks to the complicity of those in power and the cloak of impunity that protects them , ” columnist Ricardo Aleman wrote Wednesday in El Universal newspaper .
The charges against Julio Cesar Godoy brought fresh pressure on his half - brother .
Gov. Godoy , a member of the same political party , already faced questions after the state ’s attorney general and other aides were among 30 local and state functionaries arrested in May over suspected ties to La Familia .
The governor has dismissed the arrests as an election - season stunt by the administration of Mexican President Felipe Calderon , of the conservative National Action Party .
And he rejected fresh calls to resign .
“ I wo n’t give them the pleasure , ” Godoy said Wednesday .
Monte Alejandro Rubido , a national security spokesman , said that a senior gunman arrested in the recent attacks revealed details about La Familia ’s structure .
He said Julio Cesar Godoy and Solis worked for the group ’s alleged operations chief , Servando Gomez Martinez , who lives in Michoacan .
A man who said he was Gomez Martinez phoned a public affairs television show in Michoacan on Wednesday and called on Calderon to reach an accord with La Familia .
Hours later , Interior Minister Fernando Gomez Mont rejected the purported overture , saying Mexico would not negotiate with any criminal group .

After the Vietnam War , hundreds of thousands of U.S. veterans suffered toxic reactions , neurological damage , and rare cancers due to exposure to 2,4,5 , -D and 2,4,5 - T dioxin that was used in the form of the defoliant Agent Orange .
Unfortunately , the U.S. military denied the problem and failed to heed any of the lessons of this chemical butchery .
Instead , it expanded its harmful legacy to the current generation of soldiers and civilians exposed to new , more deadly chemical toxins in the Persian Gulf .
Join accomplished filmmaker Gary Null , PhD , as he explores the real truth about Gulf War Syndrome and the secrets about chemical and germ warfare that the U.S. government is hiding from its veterans and the public .
Dr. Null uncovers the hidden truths about Gulf War Syndrome , including the deadly and toxic effects of armor- piercing radioactive depleted uranium , the use of experimental and risky vaccines on over 1,100,000 U.S. troops , and the indescribable chemical contamination and environmental devastation that the military caused during the Persian Gulf Wars .
In this film , Dr. Null relies on compelling testimony from eyewitnesses who served in the military , leading doctors and scientists who specialize in chemical exposure , and those veterans still suffering from the effects of their tours of duty .
Good thing for us that Rich Noyes of The Media Research Center keeps an eye on CNN .
Good thing for CNN too .
Given the latest Nielsen ratings ( that finds them 17th during prime time ) Ted " Fidel Castro is one helluva guy ! "
Turner ’s brainchild should be grateful for any and all viewers , whatever their motivation .
Last week , according to Noyes expose ’ , " CNN aired a piece of Communist Party propaganda about how Cuba could serve as ‘ a model for health care reform in the United States ’ . "
The CNN report included clips from Michael Moore ’s Sicko as CNN ’s Morgan Neill , on location in a Potemkin Havana hospital , gushed about Cuban healthcare ’s " impressive statistics . "
" Cuba ’s infant mortality rates " he reported , " are the lowest in the hemisphere , in line with those of Canada ! "
" Amazing ! " probably gasped the type of person who watches CNN nowadays ( Noyes gets a pass here ) .
Perfect proof of " yes we can ! " they probably high - fived .
No wonder Colin Powell said " Castro had done some good things for his people ! "
No wonder Michael Moore catches so much grief from those insufferable Miami Cubans !
Before Castro only they could afford doctors , as Cuba ’s huddled masses languished in sickness and poverty !
And indeed , according to UN figures , Cuba ’s current infant mortality rate places her 44th from the top in worldwide ranking , right next to Canada ( the lower the rate the higher the ranking ) .
What CNN left out is that according to those same UN figures , in 1958 ( the year prior to the glorious revolution ) , Cuba ranked 13th from the top , worldwide .
This meant that robustly capitalist Cuba had the 13th LOWEST infant - mortality rate in the world .
This put her not only at the top in Latin America but atop most of Western Europe , ahead of France , Belgium , West Germany , Israel , Japan , Austria , Italy , Spain , and Portugal .
Today all of these countries leave Communist Cuba in the dust , with much lower infant mortality rates .
And even plummeting from 13th ( Capitalist ) to 44th ( Communist ) , Cuba ’s " impressive " infant mortality rate is kept artificially low by Communist chicanery with statistics and by a truly appalling abortion rate of 0.71 abortions per live birth .
This is the hemisphere ’s highest , by far .
Any Cuban pregnancy that even hints at trouble gets " terminated . "

Also noteworthy : according to the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons , the mortality rate of Cuban children aged one to four years is 34 % higher than the US ( 11.8 versus 8.8 per 1,000 ) .
But these do n’t figure into UN and World Health Organization spotlighted " infant - mortality rates , " you see .
So the pressure is not on Cuban doctors to fudge these figures — yet .
In April 2001 , Dr. Juan Felipe García , MD , of Jacksonville , Fla. , interviewed several recent doctor defectors from Cuba .
Based on what he heard , he reported the following : " The official Cuban infant - mortality figure is a farce .
Cuban pediatricians constantly falsify figures for the regime .
If an infant dies during its first year , the doctors often report he was older .
Otherwise , such lapses could cost him severe penalties and his job . "
More interesting ( and tragic ) still , the maternal mortality rate in Cuba is almost four times that of the US rate ( 33 versus 8.4 per 1,000 ) .
Peculiar how so many mothers die during childbirth in Cuba , and how many one - to four - year - olds perish , — while from birth to one year old ( the period during which they qualify in UN statistics as infants ) they ’re perfectly healthy !
This might lead a few people to question Cuba ’s official infant - mortality figures .
But such people would not get a Havana bureau for their news agency , much less a visa to film a documentary .
Ninety - nine percent of Cubans have no more experience with hospitals like the one Michael Moore featured in Sicko and CNN ’s Morgan Neill visited than Moore has with a Soloflex .
Most Cubans view these hospitals the way teenage boys used to view Playboy magazine and husbands view a Victoria ’s Secret catalog : " Wow !
If only . . . "
The Castroite propaganda in Sicko so outraged people cursed by fate to live in Castro ’s fiefdom that they risked their lives by using hidden cameras to film conditions in genuine Cuban hospitals , hoping they could alert the world to Moore ’s swinishness as a propaganda operative for a Stalinist regime .
Exposing the Real Che ... Fontova , Humberto Best Price : $ 2.00 Buy New $ 9.72 ( as of 04:40 EST - Details )
At enormous risk , two hours of shocking — often revolting — footage was obtained with tiny hidden cameras and smuggled out of Cuba to Cuban - exile , George Utset who runs the superb and revelatory website The Real Cuba .
The man who assumed most of the risk during the filming and smuggling was Cuban dissident — a medical doctor himself — Dr. Darsi Ferrer , who was also willing to talk on camera , narrating much of the video ’s revelations .
Dr. Ferrer works in these genuinely Cuban hospitals daily , witnessing the truth .
More importantly , he was n’t cowed from revealing this truth to America and the world .
Originally , ABC ’s John Stossel planned to show the shocking videos in their entirety , during a 20 / 20 show .
Alas , on Sept. 12th 2007 , the 20/20 show ran only a tiny segment on Cuba ’s " real " healthcare , barely 5 minutes long and with almost none of the smuggled video footage .
What happened ?
Well , the Castro regime got wind of these videos and called in ABC ’s Havana bureau for a little talking - to , stressing that ABC ’s “ bureau permit ” might face “ closer scrutiny ” if they showed the blockbuster videos .
ABC ( and yes , Stossel , whom we all otherwise admire ) wimped out .
Enter Fox News , and Sean Hannity in particular .
Your humble servant here contacted Hannity ’s producers regarding the smuggled videos and they immediately requested a look .
Within hours they jumped on them and produced a blockbuster of a show .
Seen here .
And here .
Fox viewers saw naked patients covered with flies while lying on “ hospital beds ” consisting of a bare mattress .
They saw buildings that would be condemned by the health board of any US municipality serving as “ hospitals . ”
They saw and heard Dr. Darsi Ferrer along with other Cubans who described their inability to obtain something so basic as aspirins .
“ Greed , ” was the motif of Michael Moore ’s Sicko , right ?
" Greed " is what Obama ’s plan will abolish , right ?
Well ,
Fox viewers saw footage of Cubans being told ( by regime apparatchiks ) that aspirins and other medicines just might be available to them — but only if they paid in US dollars , not the Cuban pesos they held out in desperation .

Before I worked for Ars , I had a pretty traditional office job .
As part of my daily routine , I got up at 6:30 am , took a shower , made breakfast , and sat down in front of the computer to eat and respond to e-mail before hopping in the car to sit in traffic .
It 's the " sat down in front of the computer " part that used to take some of my friends by surprise ( who responded to personal e-mail before 7 am five years ago ? ) , but that behavior seems to be increasing , with more and more people checking e-mails , text messages , and news online before their first cup of coffee .
The New York Times recently highlighted the dramatic change in many families ' mornings , noting that kids are hopping on Facebook while Mom and Dad are checking up on e-mail and Twitter the minute they wake up .
" Things that I thought were unacceptable a few years ago are now commonplace in my house , ” one mother , Dorsey Gude , told the Times , " like all four of us starting the day on four computers in four separate rooms . "
One father said that he sends his son text messages to wake him up in the morning .
These days , being hyperconnected means that everyone in the family is checking their own gadgets for updates the moment they wake up , and they even use those devices to communicate with one another before seeing each other in person .
Most firms that analyze Web traffic note that things slow down overnight but spike pretty high first thing in the morning — especially for websites that are consumer or socially oriented .
Text messages in the morning are even up — according to Verizon , texts sent between 7 am and 10 am rose 50 percent year - over - year .
For those of us at Ars , things are even worse now than they were in our pre-Ars lives .
If we 're not already up at 3:00 am checking our work e-mail , it 's the first thing most of us do the minute we roll out of bed .
The days of attempting to shower before getting online are almost long gone — after work is now the preferred shower time — and it 's a pretty common occurrence for most of the staff to be online and working for some time before remembering to wander over to the kitchen to grab breakfast .
When I asked Ars creative guru Aurich Lawson whether he usually checked in online before breakfast , he said , " Have n't eaten yet .
Just a glass of water . "
Senior editor Nate Anderson would n't even acknowledge that what he ate on a daily basis could be called " breakfast " at all .
" As I 'm working , I eat ... things , " he said .
Ars contributor Chris Foresman tried to pass off his morning habits as not - insane by noting that he does n't get online before his morning run .
When pressed , however , he acknowledged that he occasionally glances through e-mail " while stretching " before a run .
" But I try to avoid that since I tend to get sucked in , " he said .
Not everyone likes the pace and connectedness of this sort of life , including some of those who practice it .
Novelist Mark Helprin did a wonderful job summing up the feel of modern life in his otherwise execrable new tome on copyright , writing :
" The world flows at increasingly faster and faster speeds .
You must match them .
When you were a child , it was not quite that way ...
You love the pace , the giddy , continual acceleration .
Though what is new may not be beautiful , it is marvelously compelling .
Your life is lived with the kind of excitement that your forebears knew only in battle , and with an ease of which they could only dream ...
" But you can't go back , you can't fall behind , you can't pass up an opportunity , and if you do n't respond quickly at all times , someone else will beat you to it , even if you have no idea what it is . "
-- David Sirota , in his syndicated column today ,
There was a telling incident at a town hall held by Representative Gene Green , D - Tex .
An activist turned to his fellow attendees and asked if they " oppose any form of socialized or government - run health care . "
Nearly all did .
Then Representative Green asked how many of those present were on Medicare .
Almost half raised their hands .
Now , people who do n't know that Medicare is a government program probably are n't reacting to what President Obama is actually proposing .
They may believe some of the disinformation opponents of health care reform are spreading , like the claim that the Obama plan will lead to euthanasia for the elderly .
( That particular claim is coming straight from House Republican leaders . )
But they 're probably reacting less to what Mr. Obama is doing , or even to what they 've heard about what he 's doing , than to who he is .
That is , the driving force behind the town hall mobs is probably the same cultural and racial anxiety that ’s behind the " birther " movement , which denies Mr. Obama 's citizenship .
Senator Dick Durbin has suggested that the birthers and the health care protesters are one and the same ; we do n't know how many of the protesters are birthers , but it would n't be surprising if it 's a substantial fraction .
And cynical political operators are exploiting that anxiety to further the economic interests of their backers .
Does this sound familiar ?
It should : it 's a strategy that has played a central role in American politics ever since Richard Nixon realized that he could advance Republican fortunes by appealing to the racial fears of working - class whites .
The Me-First , Screw - Everyone - Else Crowd
By David Sirota
Creators Syndicate , 8/7/09
I know I should be mortified by the lobbyist - organized mobs of angry Brooks Brothers mannequins who are now making headlines by shutting down congressional town hall meetings .
I know I should be despondent during this , the Khaki Pants Offensive in the Great American Health Care and Tax War .
And yet , I 'm euphorically repeating one word over and over again with a big grin on my face .
Finally .
Finally , there 's no pretense .
Finally , the Me-First , Screw - Everyone - Else Crowd 's ugliest traits are there for all to behold .
The group 's core gripe is summarized in a letter I received that denounces a proposed surtax on the wealthy and corporations to pay for universal health care .
" Until recently , my family was in the top 3 percent of wage earners , " the affluent businessperson fumed in response to my July column on taxes .
" We are in the group that pays close to 60 percent of this nation 's taxes ...
Think for a second how you would feel if you built a business and contributed more than your share to this country only to be treated like a pariah . "
This sob story about the persecuted rich fuels today 's " Tea Parties " -- and I 'm sure you 've heard some version of it in your community .
I 'm also fairly certain that when many of you run into the Me-First , Screw - Everyone - Else Crowd , you do n't feel like confronting the faux outrage .
But on the off chance you do muster the masochistic impulse to engage , here 's a guide to navigating the conversation :
What They Will Scream :
We can't raise business taxes , because American businesses already pay excessively high taxes !
What You Should Say : Here 's the smallest violin in the world playing for the businesses .
The Government Accountability Office reports that most U.S. corporations pay zero federal income tax .
Additionally , as even the Bush Treasury Department admitted , America 's effective corporate tax rate is the third lowest in the industrialized world .
What They Will Scream :
But the rich still " pay close to 60 percent of this nation 's taxes ! "
What You Should Say : Such statistics refer only to the federal income tax .
When considering all of " this nation 's taxes " including payroll , state and local levies , the top 5 percent pay just 38.5 percent of the taxes .
What They Will Scream : But 38.5 percent is disproportionately high !
See ?
You 've proved that the rich " contribute more than their share " of taxes !
What You Should Say : Actually , they are paying almost exactly " their share . "
According to the data , the wealthiest 5 percent of America pays 38.5 percent of the total taxes precisely because they make just about that share -- a whopping 36.5 percent ! -- of total national income .
Asking these folks to pay slightly more in taxes -- and still less than they did during the go - go 1990s -- is hardly extreme .
Stripped of facts , your conversation partner will soon turn to unscientific terrain , claiming it is immoral to " steal " and " redistribute " income via taxes .
Of course , he will be specifically railing on " stealing " for stuff like health care , which he insists gets " redistributed " only to the undeserving and the " lazy " ( a classic codeword for " minorities " ) .
But he will also say it ’s OK that government sent trillions of dollars to Wall Streeters .
And that 's when you should stop wasting your breath .
What you 've discovered is that the Me-First , Screw - Everyone - Else Crowd is n't interested in fairness , empiricism or morality .
With 22,000 of their fellow countrymen dying annually for lack of health insurance and with Warren Buffett paying a lower effective tax rate than his secretary , the Me-First , Screw - Everyone - Else Crowd is merely using the argot of fairness , empiricism and morality to hide its real motive : selfish greed .
No argument , however rational , is going to cure these narcissists of that grotesque disease .
#
I imagine you 're experiencing something similar to what I am , mute horror as we look out at the spectacle of what this country has become .
Has that much of the country really lost their minds ?
Not to mention their basic civility .
Often I have answers to these questions .
Today I 've got nothing .
Nor is this insanity making it any easier to write a post I 've been trying to get written all week , a reminder -- apropos of any reform movement you can point to -- that in the end , money makes the world go around , the world go around , the world go around .
( Yes , we 've even got Joel and Liza all set to sing for us , if I could ever get the damned thing written ! )
I get the feeling that Paul Krugman is in pretty much the same situation , but he did n't let that stop him from producing a useful column in today 's NYT : " The Town Hall Mob . "
He 's at least determined to get down a good description of what he sees happening .
This part really stuck with me :
But in the end what Krugman is offering here is mostlydeep - rooted anxieties ( dare we sum them up as " dread " ? ) based on what he sees .
As so often happens , our friend David Sirota -- in today 's syndicated column -- has found a somewhat different angle from which to view the spectacle .
And from that angle he 's finding some fighting spirit .
I can sure use some of that .
Once again with David 's column , I find it works best presented the way he wrote it , without synopsizing or editorializing : Sarah Palin ?
She 's involved too ?
You betcha

About half of American adults indicate using a vibrator , according to a new survey that sheds light on acts that take place beneath the covers and behind closed doors .
The survey was funded , however , by Church and Dwight Co. Inc. , maker of Trojan brand sexual health products .
It finds it 's not just women taking advantage of the battery - operated tickle toy .
Forty - five percent of men said they 'd employed a vibrator , with most heterosexual men doing so during foreplay or intercourse with a female partner .
About 17 percent of men said they used a vibrator for solo masturbation .
And while vibrators are often hidden in sock drawers or beneath the bed , the study results suggest their use is a sign of a positive and healthy sex life .
In fact , female vibrator users were significantly more likely to have had a gynecological exam during the past year and to have performed genital self - examination during the previous month .
Women who used vibrators also reported better sex , including higher sexual desire and arousal , as well as orgasm .
However , there was no significant difference in general sexual satisfaction between female vibrator users and non-users .
" The study about women 's vibrator use affirms what many doctors and therapists have known for decades — that vibrator use is common , it 's linked to positive sexual function such as desire and ease of orgasm , and it 's rarely associated with any side effects , " said study researcher Debby Herbenick , associate director of Indiana University 's Center for Sexual Health Promotion .
The new results are based on two studies , one surveying more than 2,000 women and the other more than 1,000 men ( ages 18 to 60 ) , both of which are published this week in the Journal of Sexual Medicine .
Some other findings included :
Graham Coxon battled the effects of food poisoning to play Blur 's final scheduled reunion gig at T in the Park on Sunday
Blur nearly missed their " last gig " at T in the Park on Sunday after guitarist Graham Coxon became ill with food poisoning .
The recently reunited band were on the verge of pulling out of their headline performance at the eleventh hour , but instead chose to delay the gig while Coxon was treated at hospital .
The show did go on , but an hour and a half after they were scheduled to appear at 10.15 pm .
Blur announced they were reuniting in December 2008 , following a hiatus after Coxon 's acrimonious departure in 2002 .
Their comeback gigs , including a show at Goldsmiths College students ' union and a headline slot at Glastonbury festival , have been met with widespread acclaim from both critics and fans .
After performing their debut single She 's So High at T in the Park , singer Damon Albarn told the crowd ,
" We nearly did n't make it .
Graham literally walked out of a hospital to come here .
He 's all right .
This is our last gig . "
It is unclear whether Albarn meant the gig was the last of the summer or their last ever .
Blur have no further gigs scheduled but have mentioned the possibility of writing new material .
Albarn closed Sunday night 's performance by telling the crowd : " I want to thank everyone who 's supported us , everyone who 's given their heart and soul . "

• Corrections officer William Hesson dies at Cuyahoga County Juvenile Correctional Facility after incident with youth
A corrections officer at Cuyahoga Hills Juvenile Correctional Facility died after a wrestling bout with a resident , according to testimony in Cuyahoga County Juvenile Court Tuesday .
William Hesson had asked the youth and another resident to wrestle in the laundry room , which he unlocked .
Only Hubert Morgan , then 17 , took his offer while another 17 - year - old watched through a window .
Morgan is charged with murder and on Tuesday , a Juvenile Court judge sent his case to adult court .
The youth who was at the window testified that soon after entering the room , Hesson put Morgan in a headlock called the " guillotine , " which is commonly used in mixed martial arts .
Prosecutors say Morgan dealt a serious blow to Hesson 's midsection that caused his heart rhythm to malfunction .
Morgan 's lawyer said that the teen was trying to free himself .
Video cameras in the facility showed views of the outside of the laundry room , but there was not a camera inside to show what caused Hesson to collapse .
The two were in the room only 55 seconds and afterward Morgan ran out with Hesson 's baseball - style cap on his head .
When Hesson did n't get up , Morgan went back to help and the other youth alerted staff , who then called for medical assistance , according to witnesses and investigators .
Hesson died a short time later at a local hospital .
The Cuyahoga County coroner 's office later ruled the death a homicide .
A forensic pathologist testified that the blow or blows also caused damage to Hesson 's liver , which helped to determine that the severity was enough to throw his heart out of rhythm .
Assistant Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Patrick Thomas argued the violence of the blow to Hesson 's body was enough to show Morgan intended to kill the officer .
He said self - defense claims were not at issue in Tuesday 's hearing , which was held only to establish there was enough evidence to move the case forward .
Morgan 's attorney , Regis McGann , said no evidence was presented to show that Morgan purposely intended to kill Hesson .
" He [ Morgan ] went back to help him , " McGann said .
" That does not normally happen in cases where someone is trying to kill someone . "
Several witnesses said they did not see any animosity between Morgan and Hesson and that they had been joking earlier in the day when Morgan was trying to snatch a pen from Hesson 's pocket .
Investigators testified Morgan initially denied that he had hit Hesson but later admitted he struck the officer .
The case against Morgan , who is from Erie County , will now go to a grand jury , which could indict him on the same murder charges or a different set of charges , if they choose .
Morgan will remain locked up in Erie County , where he is facing charges in a separate case .
Juvenile Court Judge Thomas F. O'Malley heard about two hours of testimony before ruling .
" What happened in that room , I do n't know , " O'Malley said , noting there may not be any direct witnesses .
" You walked out and he did n't . "
Dugard Kidnapping Suspect Told FBI
He'd Cured Himself Phillip Garrido said what he 'd learned could help cure sexual predators .
Aug. 30 , 2009  -- Phillip Garrido , the man accused of kidnapping Jaycee Dugard and holding her prisoner for 18 years , walked into the FBI field office in San Francisco two days before his arrest and handed over a letter describing how he'd cured his disturbing sexual behaviors and how the information could be used to assist in curing sexual predators .
The FBI spokesman in San Francisco told ABC News the rambling letter is very similar to the postings on Garrido 's website .
The document that talks about cures for sexual predators and ways of " controlling human impulses that drive humans to commit dysfunctional acts . "
Police in Contra Costa County , Calif. , expanded their investigation into the 1991 kidnapping of Dugard this weekend .
Officials searched an Antioch , Calif. , property next door to the home of Phillip and Nancy Garrido who have been charged in the 1991 kidnap and rape of Dugard .
Dugard was found last week and reunited with her family 18 years after she was snatched from outside her South Lake Tahoe home .
Police are reportedly calling the adjacent property part of a crime scene , but details were not released , according to ABC affiliate KXTV in Sacramento .
The Associated Press reports that years ago , Phillip Garrido served as a caretaker for the property .
The stepfather of Dugard says he is not dwelling on the gruesome details emerging about the Garridos .
" It 's been 18 years , " Carl Probyn told " Good Morning America , " Sunday .
" I 'm glad we got her back , I do n't care about him . "
Probyn , 56 , a wallpaper hanger , was suspected by some in - laws of being involved in the 1991 abduction .
He concedes finding Dugard , who is now 29 , is also a relief for him personally .
" I 'm free now , " he said .
" They caught him and it 's solved . "
Dugard Kidnapping Case Evidence Search Expanded
Probyn says he 's unaware if any of his relatives will apologize , but says he told his estranged wife Terry Probyn this weekend , " I do n't want these people back in my life -- they actually raised money to hire detectives to put me in jail . "
But he told " GMA " he would love to see the family reunited like it was before Dugard 's disappearance .
" This has been 18 years of hell , " he said .
On the Antioch street where Phillip Garrido lived , the neighborhood kids nicknamed him " Creepy Phil . "
Now that he and his wife face 29 felony counts for what he allegedly did to Dugard over the past 18 years , Garrido , if convicted , will almost certainly die in prison .
During most of Garrido's 58 years , criminal records show a pattern of abusing or manipulating women .
His father , Manuel Garrido , is the first to admit his son was a troubled teenager .
" He was on LSD and he had a serious motorcycle wreck and hit his head , " Manuel Garrido told reporters .
Phillip Garrido was first caught 33 years ago .
A patrol officer saw a curious light inside an 8 foot by 10 foot storage unit in Reno , Nev . A police detective repeatedly banged on the door .
" He kept banging on the door until Mr. Garrido opened the door ... and a naked woman ran out , " explained Dan DeMaranville , of the Reno police department .
The officer then " stuck a gun up the guy 's nose and that was end of that party , " DeMaranville said .
Police say Garrido's storage unit looked like a scene from a porno film .
Garrido confessed to rape and was sent to Leavenworth Prison in Kansas .
Even from inside the penitentiary , DeMaranville said , Garrido convinced a woman , Nancy Boconegra to marry him .
She has stayed with him to this day .
" He 's a pervert , " DeMaranville said .
" He should have been neutered while he was in prison . "
But Garrido was paroled after only 10 years of a 50 - year sentence .
After his release , police say Garrido and his wife , abducted 11 - year - old Dugard in 1991 from a street outside her South Lake Tahoe , Calif. , home , and imprisoned her in a shed behind their home in Antioch .
Dugard Kidnapping Case Evidence Search Expanded
Neighbors are outraged at the police and a parole system that missed numerous opportunities to rescue the kidnapped young woman .
Probyn said on " GMA " Sunday he understands the team of doctors and psychologists helping Jaycee Dugard know it will take years to get her through the ordeal .
Police say she bore two children fathered by Garrido while she was held captive .
" This is a one - of - a - kind deal -- this has never happened before , " Probyn said .
In some trickier network situations , your computer may be assigned an IP but need an entirely different IP address to access certain network resources .
You might be wondering , how on earth do you have two IP addresses at once on the same Mac ?
The answer ; Create an IP Alias !
Using an IP alias allows your Mac to have more than one IP address at the same time , this can allow you to have multiple IP addresses that reference the same machine .
While this is fairly advanced topic , you will find that creating an IP alias is easy to do with the powerful Mac OS X command line utility ifconfig .
To get started , open the command line via Terminal app or your terminal of choice .
How to Create an IP Alias on the Mac via Command Line
Type the following at the command line prompt , this will alias the new IP of 192.168.0.101 to your existing subnet mask , on the en0 network interface :
sudo ifconfig en0 alias 192.168.0.101 255.255.255.0
The syntax therefore for creating an IP alias is as follows :
sudo ifconfig INTERFACE alias new.ip.address subnet.mask.address
You will need to use sudo which requires the root / admin password .
How to Remove the IP Alias
If you want to get rid of the alias , just type :
sudo ifconfig en0 - alias 192.168.0.101
This removes the specified alias at the specified network interface .
There are many uses for this great trick , give it a try yourself if you need multiple LAN IP references to the same machine .
Driving across the Golden Gate Bridge on a gorgeous afternoon , it 's hard to imagine that California 's economy - the world 's tenth largest - is teetering on the brink of ruin .
Nonetheless , California has a budget crisis that will drastically change the quality of life in the Golden State .
Who 's to blame ?
Many observers fault Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger .
Democrats and Republicans expected the " Governator " to bring legislators together on key issues , particularly the annual struggle to balance the state 's budget .
Sadly , the hulking movie star proved to be an untrustworthy negotiator , who often appeared to be looking out for his own interests rather than brokering a compromise beneficial to California .
As a result of his ineffective leadership , the California budget crisis has deteriorated into a three - way battle , where neither Democratic nor Republican lawmakers respect Schwarzenegger .
On the other hand , many Californians blame the legislature .
The latest California registration statistics show Democrats widening their lead over Republicans , 44.6 percent to 31.1 percent , with 20 percent " decline to state " and 4.4 percent scattered among other Parties .
Republicans do n't have a majority of registered voters in a single congressional or legislative district .
As a result , Democrats have a commanding but not compelling majority in both the state Senate ( 25 to 15 ) and Assembly ( 51 to 29 ) .
In most states , this numerical superiority would permit Democrats to pass whatever legislation they desire , but California is one of only three states that require a 2 /3rds vote to pass a state budget .
Republicans have used this rule to block all attempts to pass budgets with tax increases .
Typically they play a game of " chicken " with their Democratic colleagues and after days of a stalemate , Dems cave in and meet Republican demands .
Many political pundits believe California is ungovernable , noting that our coastline is 840 miles long and 37 million people are spread over the Golden State 's 164,000 square miles .
The coastal counties tend to be heavily Democratic , while those to the east favor Republicans .
Voters in Berkeley view politics from a radically different perspective than do those in Palm Springs .
Nonetheless , while California 's decline can be blamed on Governor Schwarzenegger , the legislature , and the size and complexity of the state , the primary responsibility falls on the voters .
Although Californians have historically been narcissistic , their self - centeredness did n't affect the state 's finances until 1978 when Proposition 13 was passed .
The " People 's Initiative to Limit Property Taxation " capped property taxes at one percent of assessed value and mandated that increases would require a two - thirds majority at both the state and local level .
The " taxpayer 's revolt " signaled the beginning of " free beer " myopia , where residents of the Golden State believed they could continue to enjoy public services without paying for them .
The consequences of proposition 13 percolated throughout the state 's economic and social systems .
The California education system deteriorated to the point where it is now ranked 47th in the US .
Pundits have characterized the consequences of proposition 13 as the " Mississippification " of California .
For the past 30 years , governors and legislators have tried to keep California 's financial house together by a series of tricks , most often borrowing in anticipation of future revenues .
That worked as long as the California economy was strong , but the recession toppled the Golden State 's house of cards .
Faced with a $ 28 billion budget deficit , California 's Democratic legislators now have no choice but to dramatically reduce services .
Given the necessity to have a two - thirds legislative majority to pass a budget , and raise taxes , Dems will be forced to make drastic cuts because it wo n't be possible to increase revenues .
California 's austerity budget will have draconian impacts on state services : school and park closings , suspension of road repairs , parole of thousands of inmates , cessation of medical and social support for the needy , and on and on .
While the budget crisis will eventually affect all Golden State residents , it will have the greatest impact on those who live in poorer communities .
Residents of Beverly Hills will find money to repair their streets , pay their public - safety personnel , and retain reasonable class - sizes in their public schools .
That 's unlikely to happen in poor communities such as South Central Los Angeles .
As a result , the differences between the rich and poor will be accentuated .
There 's a way out of this mess , but it will take time .
In 2010 , Schwarzenegger will leave office and Californians will have an opportunity to elect someone who is actually a leader , as opposed to an actor who occasionally plays the part .
In the same election there will be a ballot measure that changes the budget rules to allow passage with a simple majority .
Those will be necessary but not sufficient conditions to halt California 's descent into mediocrity .
Californians have to open our wallets and pay for schools , parks , roads , public safety , and all the other perks we 've long associated with living in the Golden State .
Our choice is to either to act like adults or resign ourselves to living in a third - world country .
Albania here I come .

Adrienne Cortez is a landscape architect whose work explores themes of urban sustainability and the use of existing infrastructure as a framework for deploying green technologies .
Last year she received a New York State Council on the Arts Independent Projects grant to pursue research on that quintessential urban summer pastime of playing in the rushing waters of open fire hydrants .
Her subsequent project , nyc:uncapped , explores the social , physical , and environmental implications of this practice , and proposes an alternative strategy for beating the heat that encourages neighborhood recreational activity while dramatically reducing water waste .
Background A gushing hydrant drenching happy kids is an iconic image of urban summertime .
My first 4th of July living in New York was boiling hot and I was thrilled to see the open hydrants in person .
It was n’t until several years later that this article from the Times caused me to rethink the excitement of the open hydrant .
The article provided a shocking statistic : at full power an open hydrant pumps out 1,000 gallons of water a minute .
Uncapping , or opening , the local hydrant for relief from the heat had never struck me as anything more than a fun , and totally accepted , urban practice that had been going on for decades .
But that 1,000 gpm figure stuck in my head .
And my curiosity eventually led me to develop nyc : uncapped , a study of the common summertime practice , and , in response to those discoveries , an exploration of alternatives .
Quick web - surfing yielded plenty of articles going back for a number of summers , chronicling the water lost from open hydrants all over New York and other cities like Philadelphia , St. Louis , and Chicago .
The cumulative effect of so many running hydrants raised concern – especially since New York has had at least seven droughts in recent history .
It is estimated that the average person will consume about 7,000 gallons of water in their lifetime .
At 1,000 gallons per minute , an open hydrant will have spent the entire lifetime supply of drinking water for two people in just 15 minutes .
The water loss is staggering , particularly when you consider that hydrants typically remain open for much longer .
This tension between the ability of an open hydrant to activate public space and the potentially serious impact it has on ecological health provides the foundation for nyc : uncapped .
Exploring the uncapping ritual and its context , this project re-imagines the hydrant as more than a basic tool for firefighting – it can also be a valid opportunity for play and even a catalyst for ecologic improvement .
Context Unless they are uncapped , or you ’re in a car looking for a momentary parking space , hydrants disappear into the white noise of miscellaneous street appurtenances .
The first step in my research was to understand how the hydrant worked and fit into the New York City water supply system .
The city ’s water originates in upstate watersheds encompassing more than 2,000 square miles of land .
21 reservoirs and lakes collect , hold , and distribute water into a system of aqueducts and tunnels that travel over 125 miles to deliver more than 1.3 billion gallons of water to the city every day ( an amount that would fill the Empire State Building to the brim more than four times ) .
After being filtered and treated , the water delivered to our kitchen sinks is identical to the water flowing to a hydrant – it is all potable water .
At least 60 different boards , agencies , and committees across city and state borders form a complex web of organizations that manages the vast operations of the NYC water system .
Chief among these is the Department of Environmental Protection ( DEP ) , which is responsible for maintaining the hydrants .
Citizens are allowed to use their local hydrant only if it is equipped with a spray cap , provided and installed by the fire department at no charge .
Holes in the cap on the barrel ’s side reduce the flow of water from 1,000 to 25 gallons per minute .
Opening the hydrant without a spray cap is illegal and citizens can be ticketed or fined for what the city terms ‘ hydrant abuse ’ .
When a hydrant is fully open , water pressure in the surrounding hydrants drops , rendering them ineffective in their primary role as sources of water for firefighting .
Water pressure in nearby buildings is also affected , causing problems for hospitals , local businesses , and residents .
On top of public safety issues , the water is not free .
We currently pay indirectly for water expended from a hydrant through water rate hikes .
If hydrants were metered to charge an on the spot pay - to - play fee , the water would cost $ 2 per minute plus an additional $ 4.30 per minute to take the water into the city ’s treatment system for cleaning .
At $ 6.30 per minute , three hours romping in the local hydrant would run just over $ 1,000 – which does not take into account extra costs associated with man-hours required to close , repair , or replace broken hydrants .
nyc : uncapped
While open hydrants can be found across much of the city , Washington Heights , the South Bronx , and South Jamaica neighborhoods experience the most frequent activity , according to the DEP .
In preliminary research a single hydrant on 156th Street was notable for having been opened and closed 14 times in a single day , prompting my decision to focus nyc : uncapped on the Washington Heights and Inwood neighborhoods .
For ease of information gathering , the study also includes everything north of 155th Street in Manhattan ( the geographic boundary for Community District # 12 ) .
While only 1 % of the city ’s hydrant inventory is located in this district , 20 % of the calls to 311 complaining of an open hydrant come from this area .
Beyond the obvious temperature driver , it became apparent that the physical environment of CD12 contributes to the frequent open hydrants .
Looking at a map one would think that this area , the skinniest part of the island , surrounded by the Hudson and East Rivers and large swaths of park , would have plenty of shady opportunities for recreation .
However , major highways run through the parks and steep elevation changes ( up to 150 ’ ) make it a challenge to access much of the parkland and waterfront .
Despite the acres of parks , CD12 has one of the lowest percentages of tree canopy cover in the city .
The lone municipal pool in the district , which can handle about 2,400 visitors a day , has to serve the district ’s 50,000 + kids under the age of 18 .
People often stand in line for an hour or more waiting to be admitted .
Numerous visits to CD12 confirmed that hydrants were getting a lot of unauthorized use during the summer .
I also found plenty of residents hanging out on the sidewalks in front of their homes in cooler months , suggesting that hydrant uncapping is partially fed by a broader socially - active sidewalk life , and is not singularly motivated by physical factors .
Alternatives to uncapping
The open hydrant tradition has to evolve .
Given the projected increases in both summertime temperatures and the city ’s population , a corollary increase in the number of uncapped hydrants can also be expected .
While the creative appropriation of the hydrant and surrounding sidewalk for recreation is the beginning of a good multi-use strategy , my goal was to preserve the positive aspects of uncapping without sacrificing water resources .
Part of the city ’s plaNYC initiative is to plant one million trees by 2030 .
Why not target streets with frequent uncapping activity and limited tree cover , close those streets to traffic for the summer , and transform them into seasonal tree nurseries ?
In so doing , these temporary parks would provide immediate relief to the residents of CD12 while supporting a city - wide green agenda .
Each summer , growers would deliver a planting season ’s lot of new trees to the Uncapped Streets , their leafy cover providing relief from the sun while mitigating the intensity of heat bouncing off paved surfaces .
Temporary irrigation nurturing the boxed trees would also provide a cooling spray for locals playing tag among the boxes or pausing for a moment in the shade .
By piggy - backing on an existing program and utilizing basic materials , the Uncapped Street program could be mobilized quickly with minimal investment .
Assuming a successful reduction in “ hydrant abuse ” the temporary nursery / park program could be enjoyed for a number of years , rotating through streets in need .
Supporting one of the city ’s premiere green initiatives could become a badge of honor for these selected streets .
And with a million trees to plant , CD12 would be able to develop a permanent tree canopy by planting their share of the new trees before the Uncapped Streets program is retired .
The future uncapped While the Uncapped Streets nursery / park program meets immediate needs , I also wanted to investigate longer - term solutions to address the causes of uncapping : heat and park access .
One possibility builds upon the simple technology of a tree box filter , envisioned here as a hydrant garden .
Extending the entire 30 ’ of a hydrant ’s no-parking zone , a planted section of the sidewalk becomes a bio-retention component of the city ’s drainage system .
Storm water is slowed and filtered by the plants and their soil before entering the city treatment system .
Framed by a pair of the million new trees , the hydrant is recast as the anchor of a mini-park and micro-climate generator .
Reconfigured to use river water instead of potable water , the hydrant with its spray cap continues to provide cooling water , filtered from the river , on demand .
The spent water collects in the garden , nourishing the plants as it percolates through the soil .
Evaporation of the water and evapotranspiration of the plants “ breathing ” cools the local air .
By making the hydrant the centerpiece of the mini-park , the hydrant becomes more visible as a signifier of the city ’s hybrid approach to civil engineering , natural resource management , and recreation .
Repeated from block to block , the hydrant garden , a decentralized segment of park , reiterates the presence of a larger ecologic and engineering system at work .
nyc:uncapped was motivated by more than a concern for wasted water .
I used this study to demonstrate how a more holistic approach to urban problem solving can allow a single intervention to address several municipal challenges more effectively than looking at each issue as a discrete problem with a singular solution ( i.e. Problem : Unlawfully opened hydrants threaten public safety and ecological health ; Solution : eliminate all hydrants and have firefighters access water mains through sidewalk vaults ) .
Here , a hydrant garden provides an array of benefits to both city and neighborhood .
The bio-retention capabilities of the hydrant garden / mini - park help protect water resources by slowing the storm - water as it enters the city ’s treatment system , thus reducing peak flow of storm water and incidences of CSO discharges .
The contaminant load entering the system and requiring treatment is also reduced .
Yet the engaging ad - hoc event of uncapping can continue without threatening water resources .
The mini -park promotes neighborhood gathering and recreation while contributing to a reduction in urban heat island effects across the city .

Blue Dog Dems Receive More Health Insurance Funds than House Republicans
Pamela Behrsin | August 11 , 2009
August 11 , 2008 - Blue Dog Dems received more funds from the health insurance industry than House Republicans did , a MAPLight.org analysis showed .
The analysis compared the average amounts given to each legislator in the 2008 election cycle , using data from the Center for Responsive Politics .
The health insurance industry gave each Blue Dog Dem , on average , $ 7,567 .
The average for each House Republicans was $ 6,447 .
Here are the top recipients in the House of health insurance industry funds in the '08 election cycle :
Rep. Jim Gerlach ( R , PA - 6 ) - $ 37 , 675
Rep. Harry Mitchell ( D , AZ - 5 ) - $ 35,200 ( Blue Dog )
Rep. David Camp ( R , MI - 4 ) - $ 34,500
Rep. Earl Pomeroy ( D , ND - 0 ) - $ 34,250 ( Blue Dog )
Rep. Charles Rangel ( D , NY - 15 ) - $ 30,800
Health insurance industry contributors include AHIP , Blue Cross , Blue Shield , National Association of Health Underwriters , AFLAC , Delta Dental Plans Assn , Cigna , and other health and accident insurance firms .
Back in the 1980s , “ experts ” told us that we were training too many physicians .
We needed to decrease the number of medical students or else we would face a glut !
Now they have looked again at the data and essentially said – oops – we made some incorrect assumptions .
Medical miscalculation creates doctor shortage
Bodiford experienced what many Americans may soon face : a shortage of physicians that makes it hard to find convenient , quality health care .
The shortage will worsen as 79 million baby boomers reach retirement age and demand more medical care unless the nation starts producing more doctors , according to several new studies .
The country needs to train 3,000 to 10,000 more physicians a year â€ ” up from the current 25,000 â€ ” to meet the growing medical needs of an aging , wealthy nation , the studies say .
Because it takes 10 years to train a doctor , the nation will have a shortage of 85,000 to 200,000 doctors in 2020 unless action is taken soon .
The predictions of a doctor shortage represent an abrupt about - face for the medical profession .
For the past quarter - century , the American Medical Association and other industry groups have predicted a glut of doctors and worked to limit the number of new physicians .
In 1994 , the Journal of the American Medical Association predicted a surplus of 165,000 doctors by 2000 .
“ It did n’t happen , ” says Harvard University medical professor David Blumenthal , author of a New England Journal of Medicinearticle on the doctor supply .
“ Physicians are n’t driving taxis .
In fact , we ’re all gainfully employed , earning good incomes , and new physicians are getting two , three or four job offers . ”
The nation now has about 800,000 active physicians , up from 500,000 20 years ago .
They ’ve been kept busy by a growing population and new procedures ranging from heart stents to liposuction .
But unless more medical students begin training soon , the supply of physicians will begin to shrink in about 10 years when doctors from the baby boom generation retire in large numbers .
“ Almost everyone agrees we need more physicians , ” says Carl Getto , chairman of the Council on Graduate Medical Education , a panel Congress created to recommend how many doctors the nation needs .
“ The debate is over how many . ”
Getto ’s advocacy of more doctors is remarkable because his advisory committee and its predecessor have been instrumental since the 1980s in efforts to restrict the supply of new physicians .
In a new study sent to Congress , the council reverses that policy and recommends training 3,000 more doctors a year in U.S. medical schools .
Several problems caused their mistake .
Imagine playing quarterback and throwing the ball to a receiver running down the field .
If we throw the ball to where he is right now , we will underthrow him ( we could calculate how much by knowing his speed and how fast the ball will get to the spot where he right now ) .
Medical care has not remained static over the past 20 years .
We can do more to help patients , however , this does require increased physician intensity .
Medical progress results in more physician visits .
Patients live longer with chronic diseases , and thus we provide more care .
The portion of U.S. income spent on health care rose from 8.8 % in 1980 to 15.4 % in 2004 and will reach 18.7 % in 2014 , according to Medicare estimates .
That means more doctors are needed , whether it ’s for hip replacements or prescribing new drugs .
Demographic changes in the medical profession also contribute to the need for more physicians .
Nearly half of new physicians are women , and studies show they work an average of 25 % fewer hours than male physicians , Cooper says .
Physicians older than 55 work about 15 % less than younger doctors .
And medical residents have been limited to 80 - hour weeks since 2003 , ending decades of 100 - plus - hour weeks .
Most worrisome , the retirement of baby boom physicians means the number of doctors will start falling just as the first baby boomer turns 70 in 2016 , says Ed Salsberg , a workforce specialist at the Association of American Medical Colleges .
So what happens now ?
The first recommendation is to increase medical school enrollment by 15 % .
Along with this recommendation we must have increased funding for residencies by Medicare .
For several years we have had restrictions on residency slots – an attempt to control specialty production .
Like all experiments with artificial controls , these restrictions have unintended consequences .
Some bureaucrats would like to control each detail of medical training and practice – how many students we train , which residencies they can do , where they can practice .
These concepts will not work in our society .
Economics are the only solution to a doctor shortage , whether we consider the overall shortage , or focus on shortages in certain areas .
Until medical economics make more sense , we will continue to have local shortages .
We will also have too few physicians entering the important lower paying fields like family medicine , general internal medicine and general pediatrics .
Medical students and residents are ( as we say in medical school ) undifferentiated stem cells .
They can develop into a wide variety of specialists and subspecialists .
While some ( I ’m included in this category ) find a compelling career immediately ( it took 1 week on my 3rd year medicine rotation to understand that I was an internist ) , others will weigh multiple factors in choosing .
These factors include lifestyle , accumulated debt , geography , intellectual satisfaction , emotional satisfaction .
Estimated financial rewards remain an important factor for many medical students .
Our artifical price controlled payment system drives students away from some specialties that our society needs .
I hope that as we address the coming doctor shortage we can put pressure on payors to rethink their reimbursement schemes .
Unless we do so , 20 years from now we will still be complaining about a shortage of primary care physicians .

It ’s probably not a stretch to describe Mikhail Kalashnikov ’s AK - 47 assault rifle as the most important small - arms weapon of the 20th century .

This Day in Tech
July 6 , 1947 : The AK - 47 , an All - Purpose Killer
Born out of Kalashnikov ’s obsession to create a weapon capable of driving the invading Germans from his motherland , the Soviet weapons designer produced an assault rifle renowned as much for its simplicity as for its effectiveness .
Although it never saw service during World War II , the AK - 47 became the standard infantry weapon for the Red Army , as well as most of the other Warsaw Pact armies .
National liberation movements supported by the Soviet Union also found themselves generously equipped .
More famously , it continues finding its way into the arsenals of rebels , drug traffickers , street gangs and terrorists the world over .
Now approaching 90 , Kalashnikov remains bullish on his greatest creation .
Despite the ever - mounting death toll caused by the AK - 47 , Kalashnikov has no trouble sleeping .
“ I was doing it for my country , ” he says .
The AK - 47 has evolved over the years , which keeps it relevant to this day .
This gallery charts the history of this terrible , remarkable weapon .

The Iraqis included AK - 47s in their arsenal as well , although the Soviet Union imposed an arms embargo on Iraq after Saddam Hussein 's invasion of Iran .
Iraq 's new partner , the United States , was able to provide Saddam 's troops with the spare parts necessary to keep their Russian - made weapons functional .

Now , to be fair , I did n’t scream .
I did n’t yell .
If you had been standing outside my cubicle you would have heard sounds like " Oooof , Nnnnnngh , Unnnnnh , " but no screaming .
Donta showed no mercy .
He got that thing where it needed to go in short order , and got the front of his scrubs doused in urine as a reward .
" Struck gold on the first try , " he said .
I sheepishly explained that I wanted there to be a little urine in my bladder so he ’d know he had hit a bull ’s - eye .
He smiled , then went to change his scrubs .
As the clock sneaked up on 7:30 , the pre-op room got busier .
Then , like the biblical Hebrews fleeing the pharaoh ’s Egypt , patients on gurneys were wheeled out of the staging area and into their various OR’s .
As I was rolled into mine , I announced that the star of the show had arrived .
The various residents and techs assured me that I was the star of this particular show , and they set about getting me ready for my performance .
I had brought my iPod along with 132 songs on a playlist I called " DBS Ditties . "
This included an eclectic mix of jazz , classical music , tunes from the 30s , and lounge music .
The fact that I brought the iPod was communicated to Dr. Konrad , who had n’t arrived yet .
I was told that the good neurosurgeon was at the moment digging through his office for his iPod player .
We would have MUSIC this cheerful morning !
Dr. Konrad arrived and brandished the iPod player , he took my iPod , plugged it in , and I told him to go to the " DBS Ditties " playlist .
This generated a bit of a chuckle among the crew , and the concert began with Mozart ’s " Concerto for Piano and Orchestra , No. 24 in C Minor , KV 491 , Allegro . "
It set a dramatic tone as the crew scrubbed my head , set up the plastic sheeting , and generally made ready to dig in for their morning ’s work .
I kept up the banter , talking about things I do n’t recall at present .
It was important for the success of the surgery that I be placed in as comfortable a position as possible .
And they were able to do this quite simply .
Imagine being in a large lounge chair aside a swimming pool for hours .
My neck was fully supported , they put pillows under my knees , foam pads under my heels , and foam rests under the entire length of each arm .
Then Dr. Konrad said it was time to numb up my skull .
I had been expecting to be sedated for this portion , but was n’t feeling the effects yet .
" This is going to feel like giant hornet ’s stinging , " Dr. K said .
And he was n’t far off .
After a few very painful injections , I began to feel the sedation ... do n’t know what caused the delay .
But it did n’t seem to hurt quite as badly after the sedation started running in .
I did n’t feel it at all when they pulled out the staples over the bone markers , nor did I feel it when they cut two four inch lateral incisions into the top of my head .
I was good and groggy when they drilled holes into my skull .
Dr. K made a point of explaining that the driver on the drill was set to cut off instantly when there was no further resistance from skull – thereby avoiding the damage that could have been done to the covering of my brain .
And darned if it did n’t cut off the instant it was supposed to .
I felt the vibration through my entire skull , and smelled the kind of " burned bone " smell one might recall from drilling at a dentist’s .
I felt myself being roused from my groggy reverie , and asked if this was being done intentionally .
I was assured that this was the case , because they needed me awake and alert for the next phase .
I felt somewhat nauseous from the sedative and my entire body had broken into something of a light sweat .
Everyone was so busy fastening the frame to my bone markers , installing the probe drivers , and getting everything else ready to go , I did n’t want to bother them with such a petty complaint .
Eventually , someone noticed I was glistening and asked if I was warm .
They covered me with one of those air - cooled blankets and it was like heaven .
As I lay there , fully awake and listening , they began inserting the probes .
First , the " listening " probes .
Now keep in mind that for the last eight days , they had a good map to go by – my CT and MRI scans .
And based on previous experience and using data from other patients they had a pretty good idea of where their " target " would lie .
The subthalamic nucleus is n’t highlighted on the scans .
And every brain is slightly different .
But you go with the averages , and you have a general idea of where this tiny , football - shaped piece of brain will be found .
So , since my right side is the most profoundly affected , they advanced the " listening " probe into my left brain .
( And here , I will mention that once they had my head opened , one of the doctors called down to the waiting room and left a message for my wife , saying that they had dug two holes in my head and found brain in both of them .
Knowing my sense of humor , they felt my wife would appreciate the joke .
She did .
She also appreciated Dr. K sending her a photo of me on the table , taken with his Treo cell phone .
I showed him how to shoot it to my phone number .
He also took a photo of what was going on there on the other side of the plastic sheeting .
He sent that to Gail , too .
I wondered how much she would appreciate that . )
As the probe advanced , we could hear what sounded like an AM radio that was n’t set on a station , picking up faint static .
As the probe approached the target , the static started to pick up in intensity , like there was a thunderstorm in the distance .
They attempted a few different approaches , and each time in the area of the STN , there were the crackly sounds of misfiring neurons ... and they were able to increase the intensity even further by manipulating my right shoulder , elbow , wrist , and foot , demonstrating that these were movement neurons that were misfiring .
Dr. K remarked how easy it had been to find the area .
" And to think , not a year ago , I was seeing a neurologist who stated that I did not have Parkinson ’s , " I said .
" We ’ll send him a copy of the paper we ’re writing , " Dr. K joked .
It was necessary for me to be quiet during this portion of the operation .
If I spoke , there was a problem with bone conduction artifact ... meaning that the test probe would pick up the sound of my voice as it was heard in the depths of my skull .
But being quiet came with some challenges .
For one , my neurologist , Dr. Charles arrived around this time and took part in the limb manipulation efforts .
He stood at the foot of the OR gurney and waved .
" Hi , Bill ! David Charles here . "
" Hi , Dr. Cha ... "
I could hear my words coming out of the speakers , distorted but recognizable .
" So , this is how my brain hears sound , " I thought .
I smiled and waved .
Other times , if something was said that I wanted to agree with , I found myself nodding my head .
Not a good idea when you have probes in your brain .
I adopted a " thumbs up " signal to indicate my agreement with something being said .
Now that they had secured the target area , it was time for the stimulation test .
This was , in a word , freaky .
I had no idea what to expect , save for some possible pulling , numbness , tingling and the like .
But they needed to find that " sweet spot " between " no effect " and " side effect " and this was the only way to do it .
( Now , keep in mind that what follows is n’t exact , that for the sake of narrative I am playing fast and loose with the numbers being called out , but that this is generally how it went . )
They started with the left brain and advanced the probe to an area close to the target they had identified .
Dr. Charles held my right arm and began to manipulate it .
" One. No efficacy , " he said , meaning that set at 1 , the stimulation had no effect .
He called for it to be raised to 1.5 .
" There it is , " he said .
And he continued manipulation .
He asked me to open and close my fist , and to rotate my hand .
Even though I had been off the medication since the previous Sunday , my hand was loose and free .
" You can really feel it , " he said about the stimulation .
" The cogwheeling ( that ratcheting stiffness in a limb that comes with Parkinson ’s ) just melts away .
Raise it to 2 . "
He asked me how I felt , and I replied " fine . "
" OK , 2.5 then . "
I felt something ... even now , it ’s still almost impossible to describe the feeling .
It was something like nausea , but not quite .
But " nausea " was the only word I could think of for it .
Dr. Charles told me to take a few deep breaths and we ’d try one more .
" Up to 3 , " he said .
" How ’s this ?
Any different . "
" It ’s ...
It ’s ... It ’s ... "
" Yes ? "
" ... hard ... to ... talk ... "
And besides , I noticed I could n’t move my eyes .
He held a fist up for me to look at , and I was able to follow it on one direction , but not the other .
" Turn it off , " he said .
And as if a magnet that had been holding my eyes and tongue had been turned off , I was able to at least try to explain what had happened .
But words still failed me , and I was more than just a little freaked out by the experience .
But now that I knew this was likely to happen with each successive testing of the electrodes , I was ready for it and felt I could make a good effort to define and describe what was going on with me .
Bit by bit , the electrode in my left brain made its way towards , into , and through the target area in my STN .
We found that with therapeutic stimulation , the symptoms on my right side were eliminated .
With too much stimulation , I had varying degrees of dysarthria ( difficulty in speech ) and eye - freeze .
The speech difficulty ranged from speaking in a slow , slurred voice , to being completely unable to think of the proper word , or even to think of a word to say .
Testing my right brain followed a similar course .
The only difference was when they reached the high end of stimulation on the last few passes , my mouth pulled to the left with a half - grimace as I tried to speak , and my gaze was averted in that direction as well .
But the instant the stimulation was turned off , I would return to normal .
Dr. Charles seemed a bit frustrated that I was n’t able to be a bit more specific with what I was feeling and experiencing , but Dr. Konrad seemed more than satisfied with the electrode placements and they agreed to lock them in place and close me up .
By this time , the cooling blanket had left me feeling cold .
A heated blanket placed over my chest and shoulders warmed me up nicely as Dr. K and his team began the process of locking everything down , securing the electrodes , and closing the wounds .
They put me back into sedation and I listened as the doctors chatted amongst themselves as they applied the absorbable sutures and covered the incisions with derma bond liquid sutures – like Crazy Glue , but more expensive .
They created pockets in the skin under my scalp for the wire leads from the electrodes that will be attached to the IPG devices when they are implanted on July 3rd – that date was changed from June 25th due to Dr. K being called out of the country to take part in some other seminar or something ...
I ’m still kinda foggy on the details .
At about 1:30 – six hours after they started , they rolled me into the post - op recovery room , and Dr. K went down to the waiting room to tell Gail the operation was over and I had done well .
In the recovery room , I was assigned to Nurse Tom .
A great guy , with a soft , southern drawl , he was easy to like .
I asked for water and he brought me ice chips .
Never in the history of the world had ice chips been so delicious .
Our next step was for me to be taken to radiology for a CT scan , which we did about an hour after I rolled into the recovery room .
They let my wife come up to see me briefly , and told her that the CT would determine whether or not I went to a regular room or neuro - ICU .
" If there ’s no bleeding , he ’ll get a regular room , " the doctor said .
Shortly before 3 we headed down to radiology .
There was a Tennessee Highway Patrolman in the elevator when we got on .
" Afternoon , Officer , " I said .
He wished me a good afternoon as well .
" I understand I have the right to remain silent , everything I say can and will be used against me in a court of law ... " I said .
I was recovering from surgery , but my sense of humor was intact .
" Do n’t ask him any questions , Officer , " Nurse Tom said .
" He ’s already had his brain picked today . "
I gave Tom a high five for the zinger .
Still woozy , I crawled onto the CT table .
I could still feel the catheter , a very annoying sensation .
But they were quick about the CT and I was in and out of there in just a few minutes .
We rolled back to the recovery room and waited .
And waited .
And waited .
And waited .
A couple hours later , Dr. K ’s intern came by and asked how I was doing .
" You tell ME , " I said .
" I ’ve had my CT taken . "
He went to a nearby computer monitor screen and took a look .
He came back smiling . "
" We do good work here , " he said .
" No bleeding , just some air , but you expect that in this surgery . "
He assured me that it was just a matter of waiting for a room to open up and I ’d be on my way to a regular room on 6 North .
While we waited , Donta came back and pulled out the catheter .
I wo n’t say it was like he was trying to start a lawnmower , but it sure felt that way .
" It ’s gonna burn when you pee at first , " he said .
I asked for a urinal .
He was correct .
Nurse
Tom was my constant companion for the next few hours .
We chatted about everything under the sun .
In the meantime , he kept me hydrated with Sprite , brought me a tub of Jello , and when it was clear I would keep the Jello down – a sandwich .
And we waited , and waited and waited for a room .
Around 6 p.m. ,
Tom rolled me into a larger room with chairs and TVs and said he would bring my wife up to sit with me .
Poor Gail had been waiting since being told that the CT scan would determine whether I spent the night in ICU or a regular room .
No one had told her the CT was OK .
So she was relieved when she showed up to sit with me .
When we were alone , she offered me a Milky Way candy bar .
She bought me a candy bar , thinking I might want it .
I love her with all my heart .
At 6:30 Nurse Tom went to dinner .
Shortly after , the charge nurse for the post - op recovery room told me that they found a room for me , but that we ’d have to wait for Tom to get back .
When Tom got back , he said we ’d have to wait until after shift change , but by 7:30 or so , we ’d be in our room .
And we were .
For the first time , I got a look at my gruesome surgical scars .
I look like I was bitten on the head by a shark .
My face was swollen , my head hurt .
Gail took pictures to preserve the moment .
There was no rollaway bed for Gail in this room .
But they were able to get a pull - out chair for her to sleep on , which she did with varying degrees of success .
I know , because I was awake most of the night .
For one thing , I was nauseous from the Lortab pill I had taken for pain .
The ache was n’t so severe that I wanted morphine , but I had hoped the Lortab would cut it back a little .
All it did was make me sick .
And I felt constipated .
And my head was crackling like a bowl of Rice Krispies .
Seriously .
As I lay there , trying to sleep , my head kept up a steady " snap , crackle , pop " as the air that got into my skull was reabsorbed .
If I opened my mouth , you could actually hear it .
All night long .
Snap .
Crackle .
Pop !
UPDATE : Folks in the comments section have asked how I 'm doing now .
I 'm doing well in some respects , not so well in others .
I 've never really had a lot of tremor , which is what most folks associate with the disease , and the DBS surgery is doing a great job with the stiffness and slowness that goes with PD .
What it 's not helping with is the postural instability ( balance ) and gait .
I 've recently begun " freezing " when I walk ( briefly ) , and I 've fallen a few times in the past several months .
But for what the surgery is meant to do -- so far , so good !
And thanks for asking ! :)
I talk about my day - to - day dance with PD on my blog ( along with my progressive rants and polemics ) , which you are all invited to check out if you should feel so inclined .
Thank you all for the kind comments .
UPDATE : Rec List ?
Thank you !!!
UPDATE : This outpouring of support is actually almost overwhelming .
On behalf of my bride , I thank all of you .
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Infamous record label owner Allen Klein , who played a key role in the demise of the Beatles and also nabbed control of some of the Rolling Stones ’ best - known songs , died in New York on Saturday after a battle with Alzheimer ’s disease , a spokesman said .
He was 77 .
During a career spanning more than 50 years , the New Jersey - born accountant enjoyed a reputation as a savvy gangster - like figure .
His ruthless business practices were reviled by many , but he also earned grudging respect for bullying labels into giving rich deals to his clients .
“ Do n’t talk to me about ethics , ” he told Playboy magazine in 1971 .
“ Every man makes his own .
It ’s like a war .
You choose your side early and from then on , you ’re being shot at .
The man you beat is likely to call you unethical .
So what ? ”
It did not hurt his reputation when he was sentenced to two months in prison in 1979 for tax evasion .
He once said John Lennon hired him to protect his interest in the Beatles because he and wife Yoko Ono wanted “ a real shark -- someone to keep the other sharks away . ”
His company , ABKCO Music & Records , is one of the biggest independent labels in an industry controlled by multinational corporations .
The spokesman said it would remain family - controlled .
Two of Klein ’s three adult children work at the company , including son Jody who runs ABKCO .
( The acronym stands for Allen and Betty Klein Co. , Betty being his wife . )
Its assets include recordings by the Rolling Stones , the Animals , Herman ’s Hermits , Bobby Womack , the Kinks , Chubby Checker , Bobby Rydell and many others .
The publishing arm boasts more than 2,000 copyrights including compositions by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones , Cooke , Womack , Ray Davies of the Kinks and Pete Townshend of the Who .
SAM COOKE TO BEATLES
Klein broke into the music business by auditing record labels on behalf of clients including Bobby Darin and Connie Francis .
When he found they were owed royalties , he took half of the difference as a fee .
His first big management client was Sam Cooke , for whom he negotiated a lucrative recording deal in 1963 that gave the soul star unprecedented control over his own catalog .
Klein , who was already representing “ British Invasion ” artists such as the Animals , Dave Clark Five and Herman ’s Hermits , set his sights on the Rolling Stones , who were laboring under an onerous deal .
He renegotiated their pact in 1965 , and ended up managing the group for about five years -- taking a 20 percent fee .
The Stones eventually tired of Klein .
But the only way to break free of him was to give up the rights to their master recordings and rights to such timeless tunes as “ ( I Ca n’t Get No ) Satisfaction ” and “ Jumpin ’ Jack Flash . ”
“ In some ways Allen Klein was very much ahead of his time , ” Jagger said in the 1989 Stones documentary “ 25x5 . ”
“ We lasted about three or four years with him , really , though the ramifications of that still continue to this day . ”
Richards was more philosophical , describing their experience with Klein as “ the price of an education . ”
By then , Klein was focused on the ultimate prize , the Beatles .
He offered his help to Lennon in early 1969 , when the Fab Four ’s idealistic Apple Corps .
label was fast draining the fractured group ’s coffers .
George Harrison and Ringo Starr also warmed to his pitch , but Paul McCartney was fiercely opposed .
He preferred the expertise of his father - in - law , high - powered New York attorney Lee Eastman .
Amid a series of complex maneuverings that also have consequences to this day , Klein unsuccessfully tried to secure control of the Beatles ’ copyrights on behalf of the group .
Michael Jackson ended up with the rights 16 years later .
Klein did score a rich recording deal for the Beatles , but relations within the group were past frayed , and it dissolved in 1970 .
That year , Harrison “ honored ” Klein in a rough version of his song “ Beware of Darkness ” with the line “ beware of ABKCO . ”
“ It might have ended up being prophetic .
But at the time it was just a little joke , ” Harrison told Reuters in 2000 .
Indeed , Harrison and Klein reunited in 1971 to put on the all - star Concert for Bangladesh shows at Madison Square Garden in New York .
It took a decade for the funds to reach the refugees because of complex tax problems .
In addition to his children and wife , Klein is survived by his longtime girlfriend Iris Keitel , an ABKCO executive .
His funeral will take place in New York on Tuesday .

Enchant creature
Enchanted creature gets +X/+Y , where X is half the number of Forests you control , rounded down , and Y is half the number of Forests you control , rounded up .
Stocks have jumped 45 % from the March lows .
They have also blasted past fair value , which is about 900 on the S&P 500 on a cyclically - adjusted price - earnings ratio ( see professor Robert Shiller 's chart below ) .
So they 're now about 10 % - 15 % overvalued .
( Jeremy Grantham puts fair value at 880 on the S&P 500 .
That seems a bit precise .
Let 's call it 900 ) .
Of course , today 's overvaluation does n't tell you much about what stocks will do next week , next year , or even the next 5 - 10 years .
Before the 2007 market crash , stocks were overvalued for the better part of 20 years , and observing that did n't help you make money .
On the contrary , it usually got you fired .
What today 's valuation does suggest is that stocks are priced to return a bit less than average over the next decade , perhaps 4 % - 5 % real per year , as compared to the 6 % - 7 % they have returned over the past century .
Today 's valuations also suggest that stocks may have gotten way ahead of themselves , especially in light of the structural problems that will continue to bog down the economy .
As the chart above illustrates , every one of the prior mega - busts in the past century has been followed by a " trough " in which the cyclically adjusted PE ratio hit the high single - digits .
We did n't quite make it there in March ( the P/E bottomed around 12X ) .
This , combined with what is likely to be a decade of deleveraging , consumer retrenchment , and sluggish growth as we work off our debt binge , suggests that we still yet might hit that single - digit low before we take off on another secular bull market again .
This could be achieved either through another market crash , or a prolonged period of backing and filling as earnings growth gradually reduces the long - term PE ratio ( this is what happened in the 1970s ) .
On the other hand , it is possible that that enormous stimulus the government has pumped into the economy over the past two years will produce a much - hoped - for " v- shaped " recovery .
At this point , given the extent of the recent rally , it would presumably have to be one heck of a " V " to send stocks soaring from here .
But the last few months have already been full of surprises .
( Admit it : Back in March , is this the GDP chart you would have drawn for the second quarter ? )
The hard - liners still doing the only thing they know what to do .
CNN :
Government agents used tear gas to disperse demonstrators , and beat and kidnapped a human rights lawyer , the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran said Saturday , citing witnesses .
The advocacy group said human rights lawyer Shadi Sadr , who was walking with friends to Friday prayers , was confronted by people dressed in civilian clothes .
They pushed her into a car and drove off , the group said , citing witnesses .
In a subsequent telephone call to her husband , Sadr said she had been arrested and detained in ward 209 of Tehran ’s Evin prison , the group said .
“ Her husband reported that intelligence officers had searched his house and requested the keys to her legal office , ” the group said .
Can I at least keep one of the nineteen bags ?
Pretty please .
Oh boy , the drama made for life but we imagine somewhere along the line daddy Michael Douglas will have to laugh and turn the horror show into a PG rated film about tortured sons got hairier today when tortured son Cameron under house arrest ( we know , if you are rich and influential you get house arrest but if you are mediocre and nearly very good looking just plain Rikers … ) was foiled in another drug hatch plan .
The facts from what we understand them , please inhale slowly with us , are as follows , troubled son of famous father – Michael Douglas – Cameron Douglas recently got arrested for dealing in crystal meth .
Large doses of it .
So while awaiting trial he is now under house arrest in downtown Manhattan , NY .
Which means if Cameron wants to watch
Tv it can pretty much be arranged , order out - that too , get strung out high ?
Well , actually not .
Of course that did n’t stop Cameron from trying to use his girlfriend - Kelly Sott as a mule , ( love knows no boundaries ? ) .
Placing a phone call for her to bring some ‘ essentials ’ over to the house , including an electric tooth brush ( we know the manual ones are so laborious … )
Cameron had Kelly jam as many baggies of heroin in that damn electric tooth brush as she could so when court appointed guards smelled something fishy and probably noticed the way Cameron was clutching onto his new electric toothbrush ( healthier teeth you know … ) they decided to have a closer look .
In the end they found 19 heroin baggies , ones that matched the empty baggies that were found at the Gansevoort Hotel where Cameron and Kelly were last partying it up .
For her efforts Kelly got arrested , but at this juncture we are not sure if she gets to get ‘ house arrest ’ or the privileges of Rikers .
Love , sometimes it ’s worth it , but most of the time it ’s not - especially if your boyfriend or girlfriend is a run away addict .
You can exhale now …

Frivolous lawsuits waste billions of dollars in civil courts , but they show no signs of slowing down , and every year they seem to get more ridiculous .
We ’ve all heard about the woman who sued McDonald ’s ( and won ! ) after she spilled coffee on herself , or the thief who sued a family after injuring himself while trying to break into their house , but those are just the tip of the iceberg .
Here are ten of the most outrageous and unusual lawsuits to ever make their way into a courtroom .
10 . Man Sues Michael Jordan For Looking Like Him
Everybody wants to be like Mike , except for Allen Heckard of Portland , Oregon .
In 2006 , Heckard sued Michael Jordan and the Nike corporation for over $ 800 million after alleging that his uncanny resemblance to the NBA superstar had led to defamation , permanent injury , and emotional pain and suffering .
“ I ’m constantly being accused of looking like Michael , ” Heckard said at the time , “ and it makes it very uncomfortable for me . ”
Heckard included Nike founder Phil Knight in the case for his role in promoting Jordan ’s public persona , saying that he could n’t go out in public without people mentioning he looked like Jordan .
Heckard , who is only six feet tall , said that people at his gym had even accused him of playing basketball like Michael Jordan .
9. Man Sues Budweiser For False Advertising
In 1991 , a man named Richard Overton filed a lawsuit against Anheiser - Busch for false advertising that had led to emotional distress , mental injury , and financial loss .
Harris alleged that , unlike the what happens to guys in their ads , when he drank Bud Light the ladies were n’t attracted to him , nor did beautiful women and tropical settings appear out of thin air , as they did in another Budweiser commercial that was airing at the time .
To add insult to this grave injury , he also asserted that when he drank beer , he would often wake up hung over .
Overton sued for $ 10,000 , but the case was thrown out before ever making it to trial .
8. Man Sues Himself
In 2006 , Curtis Gokey filed a lawsuit against the city of Lodi , California when one of their dump trucks accidentally backed into his car .
The problem ?
Gokey , a city employee , was the guy driving the dump truck .
Even though he freely admitted the accident had been his fault , Gokey sued the city for $ 3,600 in damages .
After the city denied the claim and asserted that he could n’t legally sue himself , Gokey filed a new lawsuit , this time in his wife ’s name .
A city attorney alleged that this too was illegal , but Gokey ’s wife went through with suit anyway , and even raised the damages to $ 4,800 , saying , “ I ’m not as nice as my husband is . ”
7. Surfer Sues Over Stolen Wave
One thing all surfers hate is when someone “ snakes ” a wave that they were in a better position to ride .
A California man once took this anger to the courts when he supposedly sued another surfer for “ stealing a wave ” that he believed was meant for him .
The man alleged that he had endured “ pain and suffering ” as a result of not being able to carve up the surf , and attempted to take the wave thief to court .
The case was eventually dismissed when the court stated that there was no way to put a price on the pain and suffering of being denied a chance to ride a monster wave .
6. Student Sues For Right To Smelly Feet
Teunis Tenbrook , a philosophy student at Erasmus University in the Netherlands , sued his school after he was thrown out for having unusually smelly feet .
Professors and other students had complained that the smell was overpowering and made it impossible to conduct classes , and Tenbrook was eventually expelled from both the school and its library .
He sued , and after a ten - year legal battle , a judge ruled in 2009 that having smelly feet is no excuse to prevent a student from continuing their studies .
Upon delivering this verdict , the judge stated : “ Our considered opinion is that the professors and other students will just have to hold their noses and bear it . ”
5. Russian Astrologer Sues NASA
Marina Bai is a Russian astrologer who sued NASA in July of 2005 for allegedly “ disrupting the balance of the universe . ”
At the time , NASA had just fired the Deep Impact space probe into the comet Tempel 1 in the hope of studying its interior .
Bai sued for damages and “ moral sufferings , ” alleging that the comet and “ the natural balance of forces in the universe ” would never be the same , and that her astrology business would be adversely affected as a result .
Bai ’s case was originally thrown out , but was reintroduced after her lawyer was able to show that NASA ’s office in the American embassy fell under Russian jurisdiction .
She sued for over $ 300 million , which was roughly the same as the space mission ’s total budget , but her case was eventually rejected after a physicist argued that the probe had no real effect on the comet ’s trajectory .
4. Man Sues Corporations For Witchcraft
In 2008 , a Canadian man brought a $ 2 billion lawsuit against several corporations after claiming that the companies had repeatedly dabbled in witchcraft , satanic rituals , and brain wave control in an attempt to bolster profits .
The man , named Jerry Rose , alleged that companies like Microsoft and Wal - Mart had subjected him to “ invasive brain computer interface technology , research , experiments , field studies and surgery . ”
Rose also named several universities and professors as defendants in the case , saying that they had helped engineer the “ brain - drain ” technologies that had made the mind control tactics possible .
Lawyers from the companies argued that the case was outrageous and deserved to be dismissed on the spot , but the judge in charge of the proceedings agreed to hear it , arguing that all of the charges were capable of being litigated .
3. The Cable Car Nymphomaniac
In San Francisco in 1964 , a woman named Gloria Sykes was injured after the cable car she was riding on malfunctioned and careened down a hill .
Sykes suffered a black eye and some scratches in the accident , but she filed a $ 500,000 lawsuit against the city for a much more curious reason : she claimed the accident had triggered a “ demonic sex urge ” in her .
Sykes said the trauma from the accident had led to her developing an uncontrollable nymphomania , and that after it happened she ’d had sex with over 100 men , as many as 50 in one week .
The case made headlines in the Bay Area when it went to court , and many called it one of the most egregious abuses of the legal system in history .
But after Sykes ’ attorneys successfully argued that she had developed a bizarre form of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder , she was eventually awarded $ 50,000 in damages .
2. Man Sues God
In 2005 , a Romanian prisoner named Pavel Mircea attempted to sue God for fraud and gross negligence .
Mircea , who had spent twenty year behind bars for murder , claimed that God had failed to deliver him from evil , as he had been promised at his christening , and that this was tantamount to a breach of contract .
Mircea sued for an undisclosed amount , partially to be reimbursed for money he had spent on prayer candles and other religious goods , and directed his case toward the Officials of the Romanian Orthodox Church , whom he considered to be God ’s representatives on Earth .
The courts eventually rejected the case , with at least one report claiming that it was thrown out because God is not subject to ordinary law .
1. The World ’s Most Litigious Man Sues
When it comes to filing unusual lawsuits , few compare to Jonathan Lee Riches , who has filed an enormous amount of them in U.S. District Courts .
Known variously as “ Johnny Sue - Nami , ” “ the Litigator Crusader , ” and “ the Patrick Ewing of Suing , ” Riches has been known to try and take anyone and anything to court .
Targets of his over 4,000 lawsuits have included George W. Bush , the Somali pirates , NASCAR , NFL quarterback Michael Vick , New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick , Martha Stewart , and Steve Jobs .
Riches , who is currently doing time in an Oklahoma City prison , has even attempted to sue historical figures like Plato , Nostradamus , and Che Guevara , as well as inanimate objects like the Eiffel Tower , the Lincoln Memorial , and Plymouth Rock .
Arguably his most famous–and certainly his most ironic–lawsuit occurred in May of 2009 , when Riches sued the Guinness Book of World Records for naming him “ the World ’s Most Litigious Man , ” claiming that the company had no right to publish his “ legal masterpieces . ”

Schumer Threatens Filibuster Over Concealed Carry Reciprocity
New York State – -( AmmoLand.com ) - New York Sen. Charles Schumer announced Friday that he would do all it takes to prevent Bill S. 845 — a bill that will establish concealed carry reciprocity amongst the majority of US states , from passing the Senate including a filibuster .
“ To say that someone who gets a license in another state can then take their gun into Central Park or into Eisenhower Park without any checking with local law enforcement is appalling and could affect our safety , ” Schumer ( D - N.Y. ) said in a recent interview .
Schumer , estimated the amendment has the support of about 55 senators and pledged a filibuster to prevent a vote on the amendment if necessary .
In typical gun banner rhetoric Shumer is portraying this bill as trampling the existing gun laws of states like NY when the fact is this bill clearly spells out that all concealed carry holders when visiting a state other than their own would be bound by gun laws of that state .
This bill will do nothing more than allow CCW holder from other states the confidence to know that any state with reciprocity will honor their CW permit from their home state .
Action :
Residents of New York should ask the Senator to support their second amendment rights and their right to self defense and either Vote for or at least do not impede the process of this bill through the Senate .
Sample Letter — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — ——————
Please support the Thune / Vitter amendment to the Department of Defense authorization bill .
This amendment will protect the right of citizens to carry firearms outside of their home state without violating the rights of the other states .
Thus , the reciprocity language masterfully protects the principle of federalism while also promoting Second Amendment rights .
If you find that you can not support this bill I ask that you do not hinder the process in fairness to the citizen of New York state that believe in the right to self defense of themselves and their family .
A person ’s right to defend himself and his family should not end at the border of his state .
I urge you to vote for the Thune / Vitter concealed carry amendment and to oppose any modifying actions that seek to weaken their amendment .
Sincerely

Music moguls are opening up another can of web whoop - ass on alleged copyright - infringement miscreants , this time suing online lyrics sites .
And no , this is n't a move by the Recording Industry Ass. of America ( RIAA ) , which is apparently still basking in the glory of its $ 1.92 m victory over the file - sharing mother of four , Jammie Thomas - Rasset .
This time out it 's the National Music Publishers Association ( NMPA ) , which announced Monday that three of its members - Peermusic , Warner / Chappell , and BugMusic - have filed suit against two websites that threaten the commonwealth by posting song lyrics without paying the NMPA for the right to do so .
The two targets of their suit are LiveUniverse , producer of hugely popular video , social - networking , and music sites , headed up by MySpace founder Bud Greenspan ; and Motive Force LLC , the group behind free - lyric site LyricWiki and led by Sean Colombo .
In addition to suing the sites , the NMPA is also suing Greenspan and Columbo as individuals .
And the amount of money involved is huge .
The suit against Motive Force , for example , cites hundreds of thousands of lyrics on LyricWiki , and claims that " Plaintiffs are entitled to maximum statutory damages ... in the amount of $ 150,000 for each timely - registered works that was infringed . "
In the suits , the plaintiffs describe themselves as " music publishers that , collectively , represent many thousands of individual songwriters who have written millions of musical compositions , including some of the most popular and beloved songs of all time . "
We assume that among the beloved songs to which the suit refers is " Pussy Monster " by Lil Wayne , represented by Warner / Chappell .
Lil Wayne 's delicate expression of lyrical imagination is legally hosted on TuneWiki , with which the NMPA has a licensing agreement .
In a canned statement explaining his reasoning behind the suit , NMPA president and CEO David Israelite said : " Music fans are the biggest losers when licensed businesses , like LyricFind , Gracenote and TuneWiki can't survive and prosper because unlicensed , illegal businesses are allowed to thumb their noses at the law . "
An argument can be made that publishing lyrics online promotes music purchases and gives artists visibility to potential new fans .
But the fact that some sites have NMPA licenses and some do n't sticks in Israelite 's craw .
" We are confident the courts will conclude that , like Napster and Grokster before them , these sites are simply freeloading off artists and fans , " he said .
The suit against LyricWiki also states that the site " knowingly assist[s ] and induce[s ] third - party software developers ( which provide software appplications and services ) to distribute copies of lyrics from Plaintiff 's Songs to consumers ' computers and personal media player . "
However , earlier this month Columbo published a letter on the LyricWiki API Developers Google Group telling developers that licensing agreements with big music publishers meant that the company could no longer add programmatic access to LyricWiki 's collection :
" We tried to arrange some way to let API Developers license through us , but this was not possible , " the letter read .
" While this is not something we are happy about , it is a necessity in order to finally secure licensing for LyricWiki from the major publishers which will allow the project to survive indefinitely . "
While Columbo's letter indicates that licensing negotiations are underway , the suit against him and Motive Force states that : " Defendants plainly understand that the lyrics featured on the LyricWiki Website ... are subject to copyright protection and have knowingly decided to forgo obtaining the necessary licence from the copyright owners simply to maximize their profits at the expense of Plaintiffs and the songwriters . "
We 'll let the judge sort out those conflicting claims , but Columbo appears have a dark sense of humor about the whole kerfuffle .
On LyricWiki 's home page , he announces that " LyricWiki API is going away " - and links that announcement to the lyrics of Metallica 's " Fade to Black . " ®
Modern Australia lacks big land predators , but until about 30,000 years ago , the continent was ruled by Thylacoleo carnifex , the marsupial " lion . "
Several well - preserved skeletons of the leopard - size beast have been found .
Now , a newly discovered cave painting offers a glimpse of the animal 's external appearance .
In June 2008 , Tim Willing , a naturalist and tour guide , photographed an ancient painting on a rockshelter wall near the shore of northwestern Australia .
Kim Akerman , an independent anthropologist based in Tasmania , says the painting unmistakably depicts a marsupial lion .
It shows the requisite catlike muzzle , large forelimbs , and heavily clawed front paws .
And it portrays the animal with a striped back , a tufted tail , and pointed ears .
Those last three features are n't preserved in skeletons , but Aborigines would have known them well .
Australia 's first people landed on the continent at least 40,000 years ago and were contemporaries of the big predator .
Previously known rock paintings hinted at marsupial lions , but were rudimentary and could have depicted the other striped marsupial predator , the dog - size Tasmanian " tiger . "
That species succumbed to competition from humans in 1936 , much as the marsupial lion may have done millennia before .
The findings were detailed in Antiquity .

Best Online Savings Account List Updated September 2020
“ Find the best high yield online savings account ” is always my advice when people ask me for recommendations on where to park their money allocated for possible short term use .
These high yield online savings accounts have :
Liquidity and Flexibility – Money is accessible right away via online transfers ( available usually in 2 business days ) Safety – FDIC insured ( bullet proof ) High Yield with Good Rates – Pretty much the highest return on your money for the safety that it provides right now .
Many institutions are reducing their once high yields down to levels that are close to zero , but some online savings accounts are still offering rates that are worth the effort to seek out .
If you have cash sitting somewhere not collecting interests , you ought to look at these high yield accounts as an investment vehicle that ’s virtually bulletproof .
Here are a few that I have personal experience with and feel comfortable recommending .
This list is up to date as of September 2020 .
CIT
Bank may not pop into your mind when you think of brick and mortar banks but their online savings offering is widely popular .
With the usual FDIC insurance and pretty much the highest interest rate available in the marketplace , what ’s not to like ?
( We wrote a review of the bank too .
Check out the CIT Bank review here . )
Current Yield – 0.55 %
Make $ 150 or More in Direct Deposit Each Month , or Have $ 25 k Balance or More to Qualify for Rate
Check Out the Money Market Account for 0.60 % APY Rate
You Must Pick the Savings Builder Option After You Click Through The Link
FDIC Insured
Interest Rate Trend in the Last Month : Down

UFB
Direct offers the highest rate in the industry right now and with no minimum balance or deposit requirements , this is the bank to beat .
I also like how they give you an ATM card for those who would like to access their funds that way .
Current Yield – 0.40 %
Must Have $ 10,000 or More to Qualify for Rate
FDIC Insured

How to Find the Best Online Savings Account
When we compare different products at first , we look at all the bells and whistles but we usually end up caring about none of them after we start using the service .
What I found with online savings accounts are that :
Pretty much all of them are FDIC insured .
The difference in the interface means nothing because I get used to it after a while .
Some features , like the FNBO Direct free bill pay or a debit card , are great but I can always find an alternative way of accomplishing the same thing .
So nowadays , all I really care about is the rate and the history of how the institution lowers and raises rates .
To that end ( and this is subjective ) , my ranking for the banks are :
CIT Bank – Best rate available now plus use promotional code PREMIER to get $ 100 for free .
Sign up quick because the cash bonus expires soon .
Note :
Once again , this is subjective so take the ranking with a grain of salt .
Also , note that there are many options out there and these are actually the ones I recommend .
So just because Everbank appears last does n’t mean it ’s no good .
In fact , I still highly recommend them to anyone that asks .
How Online Savings Accounts Save You Money
If setting up an online savings account is something you would like to pursue , you will want to know how to save money with online savings accounts .
First , you need to have a bit of savings to open an online savings account .
No , it ’s not because of the account minimums which is at $ 1 for some banks , but rather for the effort to make a difference for you .
Since this account will be accessible for transfers between this account and your regular savings and checking accounts , you can use these funds however you want , to pay bills , replenish your checking account , etc .
But you must keep in mind that it can take up to 4 days to have funds from an online savings account transferred into another account .
Although this instant inaccessibility may at first seem like a drag , in the long run , you may find that it acts as a deterrent for reckless spending .
You cannot access this account in any other way than by transfer .
For most options , no checks can be written from an online savings account , nor can you access it by ATM .
Online savings accounts can garner interest rates as high as 6 percent ( in the good old days ) and more than 2 percent ( currently ) , so why would you let your money set in a regular low interest savings account ?
To begin , look at the list above for the best rates .
There are even online savings accounts available from well known banking concerns that have been around for generations .
Once you have selected the place you want to open an account , click through to their website and fill out the necessary online forms .
The questions are the same as those you need to answer when opening up any bank account but the do it yourself approach usually saves you quite a bit of time .
Since there are no fees imposed when transferring funds from one account to another , you may find that you want to open more than one online savings account and take advantage of any higher interest rates being offered .
There is no limit to the number of transfers you can make between accounts .
Investing in other investments may offer higher returns , but an online savings account lets you transfer funds without penalties or added fees .
Although your money is in a secure place , you can transfer it to your regular checking or savings account whenever you want , keeping in mind that the transfer can take up to 4 days .
You can also transfer funds from your regular checking and savings account into your online account at any time , thus taking advantage of the higher interest rates online savings accounts offer .
So you make money with online savings accounts because of the higher interests they pay , and , because it takes days to finalize a transfer , you are less likely to use funds from your account , thus allowing a profit buildup that you would not garner in a regular savings account .
How to Get a Better Experience with Online Savings Accounts
One of the biggest fears of opening an online savings account is the fact that there is no physical branch .
For some , there ’s a misconception that for some reason , it ’s not as safe if you run into any problems .
In fact , many people on the web have expressed concerns with different banks even though the banks themselves offer a solid savings product .
If you want to keep your sanity and take advantage of the higher yield that these savings account offers , here are some tips for you .
Account Opening –
Make sure you are filling out the correct information to avoid your account being put on hold .
Most of these banks will automatically approve you if everything checks out , but this wo n’t be the case if you say , your social security number does n’t match your name .
Also , some people would mistakenly type in the wrong initial deposit amount and expect the online bank to correct it on the fly .
If it ’s your mistake , own up to it and work with the banks nicely to see if either institution will reimburse the overdraft fees charged .
It ’s a SAVINGS Account – Even though it ’s very convenient , it is still a savings account .
So many people treat it like a checking account and try to pay bills with it even though it ’s not the intention .
Consequently , they run into the six withdrawal per month limit set by the government and complain why they are charged a fee .
Initial Deposit Hold –
Most of the banks will hold your initial deposit while they try to receive your funds .
Expect five to ten days where your money will be inaccessible at the beginning .
Fortunately , your bank will allow you to start earning interest on your money even though it seems to be inaccessible .
Transfer Takes Time – Like it or not , transferring money from one bank to another takes time .
In most cases , it takes three business days or so .
Again , this is a savings account .
If you expect every transfer to be instant , perhaps you should keep your money at your local bank earning 0.10 % interest annually .
Of course , some of the complaints of certain companies are legitimate and should be addressed on a case by case scenario , but most of us have nothing to worry about as long as we follow some simple guidelines .
What is an Online Savings Account ?
If you are interested in earning the highest possible interest rates on your savings account , you need to ask yourself the question , “ what is an online savings account . ”
An online savings account is an essential money management tool that allows you to maximize the interest rate you get on your money while minimizing the risk associated with higher interest rate investments like stocks , bonds , or other investment vehicles .
An online savings account is a traditional savings account , like those you would find at a standard brick and mortar bank or credit union .
An online savings account is simply a method of putting your money into a savings account and earning interest .
Most online savings accounts are FDIC insured , up to the maximum limits for an FDIC insured account .
They are thus risk free savings vehicles that allow you to earn interest on your money .
An online savings account may have many benefits over a more traditional brick and mortar account .
The main benefit is that you tend to earn a higher interest rate on money in an online savings account .
As of 2009 , the interest rates for online accounts could be as much as 3.0 % higher than an interest rate paid on a traditional bank account opened at a local bank .
Online savings accounts are able to offer higher interest rates because they tend to have lower operating costs than a traditional bank .
While a traditional bank must maintain a building , and pay tellers and other customer service personnel , an online savings bank does not typically have standard retail banks .
All transactions , including most customer service activities , are conducted over the Internet .
The online banks take advantage of these lower overhead costs to pass the savings on to consumers in the form of higher interest rates .
This helps online banks attract customers and encourages customers to invest their savings in one of these Internet institutions .
Online Savings Accounts Versus Traditional Savings Accounts
There are a number of differences between online savings accounts and traditional savings accounts .
The main difference , of course , is the higher interest rate paid by an online account .
However , there are several other important differences that you should consider when opening an online bank account .
Depositing and Withdrawing Money
When you deposit money in an online savings account , you must do so wirelessly .
There is no ATM to go to deposit your paycheck and no teller window to go to where you can hand over cash .
This means you either must send in a traditional paper check or use a completely wireless method of transferring money .
ACH transfers or wire transfers are the most popular way to fund online savings accounts .
You can initiate a transfer from the online savings institution or from your own local bank .
If you initiate a transfer of money from the online savings account website , you give the online account access to your local bank account .
The online account then transfers the money from your traditional bank account into their account .
The withdraw will show up as a withdrawal on your bank statement .
In many cases , no fees are charged for this .
You can also initiate the money transfer from your bank to your online account , setting it up as a bank - to - bank transfer .
In some cases , there are fees associated with this , so ensure you check your local bank ’s rules regarding transferring money electronically online .
Withdrawing money works in much the same way .
Your online savings account will either allow you to transfer money from the account to your regular bank , or they will send you a check for the amount of money you want to take out .
Again , there may or may not be a fee charged for these services , so check the rules with your online savings account .
Like a savings account , you do not have “ check writing ” privileges from your online savings account .
This means you cannot usually make bill payments directly from your online savings account .
In most cases , you cannot make payments directly from any savings accounts , since the purpose is to save the money and not spend it , so in this regard , there is little difference between your online savings account and a standard savings account .
Customer Service Options & Banking Interface
Most online savings accounts also offer online customer service .
This can come in the form of email support or online live chats .
Some online banks offer traditional 1-800 numbers where you can get customer service help and advice as well .
Again , there is no physical location so you cannot go and speak to someone in person about questions with your online savings account .
You must be comfortable interfacing with your account primarily in an Internet format , so make sure the website for your online bank is easy to navigate .
Interest Rates on Online Savings Accounts
Since the major benefit to an online savings account is a higher interest rate than a traditional account , you will want to make sure you get the best interest rate possible .
You can do this by using one of the many online tools available to compare interest rates for online savings accounts .
Some of the online savings accounts that pay the highest interest rate have a high minimum or daily balances for opening an account .
This means you must open the account with a set amount of money and keep that amount of money in the account on a daily basis .
Ensure that you check these rules when opening an account so you do not end up being charged fees .
Opening an Online Savings Account
Online savings accounts can be opened online from the website of the bank that you select .
Many online savings accounts will offer you a bonus or incentive for opening an account or making an initial deposit .
These bonuses can range from $ 25 to over $ 100 or can come in the form of a free gift .
Some online savings accounts even offer a referral bonus if you get friends and family to open an online account with their bank .
Be on the lookout for these offers to maximize your potential savings and to jump start your online savings account .
Restrictions on Online Savings Accounts You Should Know About
Online savings accounts have a number of potential upsides , including higher interest rates than traditional accounts , but unfortunately , there are a number of restrictions on online savings accounts that you should be aware of before you invest your money online .
Minimum Balance Requirements
Some of the highest paying online savings accounts have minimum opening balances or minimum daily balances .
This means you have to have a certain amount of money to open an account , and you have to have a certain amount of money in there at all times .
If you allow your balance to dip below these mandated minimums , you could find yourself facing hefty fees and charges .
These fees and charges may negate all of the potential benefits you get from the higher interest rate .
Monthly Contribution Requirements
Online savings accounts may also require you to contribute or add a certain amount of money each month .
One of the highest paying online savings accounts , offered by WestBank , requires a monthly contribution .
Certain other accounts have this stipulation as well .
The minimum amount you need to contribute each month varies , but be aware of this and ensure that you can fulfill the rules before signing up for an online savings account that has this feature .
Limit on Transfers and Withdrawals
Some online savings accounts limit the number of transfers you can make to the account .
Both adding money and taking money out can be limited .
Money markets , for example , are one of the highest paying online savings accounts , but these types of accounts have the most restrictions on online savings accounts .
Federal rules mandate that in most money market accounts , no more than six withdrawals or transfers occur on a monthly basis .
This means that you cannot put money in or take money out at will ; you must comply with these regulations .
Some online savings banks also add their own limitations and rules for getting money into , or out of , the account .
These rules can cover everything form how much you are allowed to take out at one time , to how often you can take out money .
If you are uncomfortable about these types of restrictions , do n’t choose an online savings account that puts these limitations on you .
However , understand that many of the higher interest rate accounts do have some type of regulations regarding access to your cash .
Slow Withdrawals and Deposits
Savings accounts in general , including online savings accounts , do n’t usually come with a debit or ATM card for fast access to your cash .
Money in a savings account is meant to be saved .
However , when you have a savings account at a standard local bank , you can walk into the bank and take out money if you need it .
This is not the case with online savings accounts , which by definition exist online and not in person .
Since there is no local branch , you need to wait for funds to transfer if you want to deposit money or if you need access to your savings .
Depending on the bank , this wait can be anywhere from two to three days to a week or more .
The method by which you get your money can also be limiting .
Most online banks will either transfer money from your online savings account into a standard bank account or will send you a check .
Both of these things take time , and there may be fees associated with them .
If you need fast access to your savings on a regular basis , this restriction for an online savings account may prove to be an impossible barrier for you to overcome .
Customer Service Issues
With online savings accounts , the days of the friendly neighborhood banker are officially gone .
There are no tellers for you to see , and no local bank branch with a helpful manager who you can go to with your concerns .
Most online savings accounts offer customer support through email or through online chat .
If they do have a telephone number , the telephone calls may be routed overseas , or there may be long hold times or limited support .
If you are not comfortable navigating a web environment , an online savings account may not be right for you .
Most websites are easy to use and provide features that are designed to help the customer , but a certain amount of technical know - how is still required to find your way around the site and get the technical help you need .
Interest Rate Caps
While online savings accounts tend to pay more than in - person savings accounts , the interest rates are nowhere near as high in 2009 as they were in times before the recession and the fall of the stock market .
In 2006 , 2007 , and even into 2008 , it was possible to find online savings accounts or money market accounts that offered an interest rate somewhere between three percent and five percent .
Though online savings account rates are good for an FDIC insured account where your money is safe , the rates may not match the rate - of - return you could get with other investments .
You will need to weigh the risks of other higher return investments with the relative safety , but lower interest , growth of online savings accounts to determine whether this investment option is the right choice for your money .
Evaluating Online Savings Account Restrictions
When selecting an online savings account , consider what is most important to you .
You will need to look at your own personal income situation , the likelihood that you will need ready access to your money , and your comfort and familiarity with web based banking .
While the decision to use an online savings account may not be right for everyone , if you do not feel the restrictions are inhibiting , then it may be the best solution for your monetary investment .
An online savings account can certainly help money grow faster then a local savings account with a smaller interest rate , and in many cases , it makes sense to get the most interest for your money .

The baton comes down .
It always starts like that .
The traffic cop looms in the hard summer sunlight , in the semblance of a breakdown lane that runs in the middle of screaming traffic .
The stick -- and here we curse -- is pointing straight at us .
“ Now you ’ll see the real Russia , ” I mutter bitterly to my visiting mother .
To the Russian driver , I wail : “ Why ?
What did we do ? ”
“ Bastards , ” he replies .
My husband frowns ; we are almost to the airport to pick up his mother .
They always get you on the way to the airport , when you are most likely to be desperate .
You are about to miss a flight , or rushing to greet a visitor .
Your job , your domestic peace , your nonrefundable plane ticket hang in the balance .
Advertisement
For Russia ’s army of crooked traffic cops , highways to the city airports are an excellent hunting ground .
Show me this document , the cop says .
Show me that document .
We root around in the glove compartment .
An inspection card is expired by a few weeks .
Triumph for the traffic cop !
Well , he smirks , of course , I ca n’t let you drive this car .
You ’ll have to leave it here .
You ’ll have to take a taxi .
We all know what comes next .
He and the driver huddle behind the raised trunk of the car , and negotiation ensues .
The cops never like to be seen taking the cash .
It ’s an inexplicable coyness , given that every passing motorist knows precisely what is transpiring .
Advertisement
“ One hundred dollars , ” groans the driver , easing the car into second gear , third gear and gunning back into the flow .
This is what traffic police do here :
They pull you over , and they collect bribes .
Good luck flagging a squad car if you have a spot of trouble -- a flat tire , say .
But if there ’s some sneaky spot , a lane that abruptly disappears or a sign hidden behind an overgrown branch , rest assured a policeman lurks nearby .
Well , so what , you say .
The traffic cops are crooked .
A trivial rite of daily existence ; a hassle but not a tragedy ; hardly worth discussing , really -- except when you consider that this is the tentacle of the great post - Soviet bureaucracy that most often touches many Russians .
And so , in a sense , their greedy presence is the face of the state itself .
Rush hour after rush hour , traffic cops stand as pervasive , petty reminders that cynicism is not an affectation , but a requirement ; that one false step can lead to a mess that strips you of time , money and another degree of equanimity .
Advertisement
But they manage to entangle the drivers too .
Everybody plays along , everybody pays ; the drivers and the cops feeding one another in silence , a living illustration of how we get pulled into bad systems in which we simultaneously create and are victimized by the corruption , until we are repressing ourselves .
Vyacheslav Lysakov runs a drivers ’ rights group called Freedom of Choice .
He has little patience for the bribe - taking cops and even less patience for the drivers who pay .
“ Before we start to look for trash in the eye of the traffic policeman , we should look into our own eyes , ” he says .
“ When I am asked , ‘ When will the corruption stop ? ’
I always say that it will only stop when we stop paying bribes . ”
And , of course , he ’s right .
But here ’s what I say , nevertheless :
Pay the bribe !
Because once I fumbled naively onto the path of the righteous and , my friends , it is a trail of sorrows .
Advertisement
If you pay the bribe , it may cost you $ 40 , $ 60 , maybe $ 100 , plus 15 minutes and a few curses muttered under the breath .
If you do n’t pay the bribe , you have to go to traffic court .
And it takes months to get a court date , and meanwhile you do n’t have a license , even if it ’s your American license .
And if you need to , for example , get that license back because you are leaving for a vacation in the United States and you want to drive while you ’re there , then you may ( let ’s pretend this is hypothetical ) have to hunt down the man in the bowels of the traffic bureaucracy who is powerful enough to get that license back .
And that bribe will be plenty steep ; lots more than you ’d have paid on the side of the road .
Hypothetically .
You travel to some sad sagging building where stray dogs howl at the doors and pay what you have to pay .
At least that ’s over , you think .
Advertisement
But you are mistaken .
When you get back from vacation , they start calling you up , because they have to put your license back in the court file .
Only then do you realize that you have paid that big bribe just to borrow your license .
By now some weeks or months have passed , and at last you have your day in court .
But when the moment arrives , the judge snaps irritably that the traffic police have n’t properly assembled their case and slams the folder shut .
A new court date is set .
You wait .
When at last your case is heard , the judge glances over the maps you have brought , listens to your earnest entreaties and concludes what you knew all along :
You were entrapped .
Advertisement
And you think to yourself : I should have paid the bribe .

From CreationWiki , the encyclopedia of creation science
Communism is a type of social hierarchy based on support for only two real classes , the proletariat and bourgeoisie , or workers and employers .
It is a political and social theory of class struggle popularized as a natural expression of socialism and made into doctrine largely by Karl Marx with help from Friedrich Engels , which both compiled this ideology into a book called the Communist Manifesto during the middle period of the 19th century .
[ 1]
The doctrine further states that in order for this unavoidable process to continue revolution is a necessity .
Revolution in its correct path manifests communism .
A common approach to life as federated communities , rather then a society based on individuals which is conservatism or the control of core agents of industrial wealth production within communism which is socialism . [ 2 ]
A church demolished under communist Russia in 1931
“ The distinguishing feature of Communism is not the abolition of property generally , but the abolition of bourgeois property .
But modern bourgeois private property is the final and most complete expression of the system of producing and appropriating products , that is based on class antagonisms , on the exploitation of the many by the few .
In this sense , the theory of the Communists may be summed up in the single sentence : Abolition of private property . [ 3 ] ”
However , there are non-Marxist variants of communism such as Christian communism , and anarcho - communism , though these ideas are not at all as prevalent as Marxist brands of communism .
Characteristics
“ In bourgeois society , therefore , the past dominates the present ; in Communist society , the present dominates the past .
In bourgeois society capital is independent and has individuality , while the living person is dependent and has no individuality .
And the abolition of this state of things is called by the bourgeois , abolition of individuality and freedom !
And rightly so .
The abolition of bourgeois individuality , bourgeois independence , and bourgeois freedom is undoubtedly aimed at .
By freedom is meant , under the present bourgeois conditions of production , free trade , free selling and buying . [ 4 ] ”
Economic Characteristics
The main proposals of the Communists who follow the Manifesto ( the majority do ) are the previous promises of Marx like abolition of private property .
The term private property is left ambiguous as to the exact definition , if it refers to private property or specifically means factories , businesses or just wealth as some Communists believe .
Community ownership is advocated [ 5 ] over individual management with forced labor armies and heavy progressive tax burdens that redistributes wealth coinciding with violation of what is natural rights .
What could be said as Marx 's first error is his marginalization of the entire middle - class who neither labor as much as the proletariat or own production as do the bourgeoisie .
Marx did attend university in Bonn and in Berlin , claiming understanding of history , economics , and sociology .
Karl Marx 's worldview saw years of social development toward injustice and income disparity which creates poverty , highlighting the only solution of ridding property rights from man .
“ The theoretical conclusions of the Communists are in no way based on ideas or principles that have been invented , or discovered , by this or that would - be universal reformer .
They merely express , in general terms , actual relations springing from an existing class struggle , from a historical movement going on under our very eyes .
The abolition of existing property relations is not at all a distinctive feature of communism . [ 6 ] ”
The Communist Manifesto when read calls for the altering of education as a means to disintegrate the family structure ;
“ The bourgeois family will vanish as a matter of course when its complement vanishes , and both will vanish with the vanishing of capital .
Do you charge us with wanting to stop the exploitation of children by their parents ?
To this crime we plead guilty .
But , you say , we destroy the most hallowed of relations , when we replace home education by social .
And your education !
Is not that also social , and determined by the social conditions under which you educate , by the intervention direct or indirect , of society , by means of schools , &c . ?
The Communists have not invented the intervention of society in education ; they do but seek to alter the character of that intervention , and to rescue education from the influence of the ruling class .
The bourgeois clap - trap about the family and education , about the hallowed co-relation of parents and child , becomes all the more disgusting , the more , by the action of Modern Industry , all the family ties among the proletarians are torn asunder , and their children transformed into simple articles of commerce and instruments of labour .

Very few countries today claim or implement communism as a way of life , let alone socialist economic policies to their fullest extent .
Largely because of the types of social unrest and anarchism inherent in the systems .
It is based in a totalitarian type government favoring State commanded and thus planned economics .
The communal grouping of citizens and socialism inherently rejects individuality when interacting with the government .
Ultimately when in full effect , representative and especially economic power is lost through taxation .
Taxation inherently limits individual power by limiting the ability to keep more of what was earned and thus what can be invested into private property .
In order to redistribute economic power to others socialism is embodied and executed from within the State apparatus as it deals with revenue gained from taxation .
Over the 20th century many nations have been influenced by communistic thinking in one way or another .
China for example is still a practicing communist nation in many ways by lacking appropriate checks and balances on power and appropriate representative power .
The social or societal approach that demands dealings with poor societies and mentally ill are shown to present common authoritarian or communistic approaches . [ 8 ]
China has also , however adopted reforms of which embrace liberalized trade markets within the past 50 years , opening up their domestic markets for foreign investments . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ]
A trend that develops domestic politics and a foreign policy with two - faces .
One being atrocious internal policies for complete national control , and secondly adoption of Western elements such as economic globalization for relevance in the international community .
Land and Capital
While nations like America do in fact have government - owned lands , and protected national wildlife parks communist nations own all land with no concept of private ownership .
Without land ownership rights citizens are unable to decide their own business policy because the land and the actual entity that is the business ( meaning its capital or wealth ) itself would be State - owned .
All income is the property of the State funneling the majority for their purposes of continuing in power through redistribution .
Redistribution of Wealth
One of the most well - known concepts of Communist theory , and a fundamental tenet of socialism , is celebrated by this saying ;
“ From each according to his ability , to each according to his needs ! [ 12 ] ”
Popularized by Karl Marx , it essentially means that each member of a commune within a communist society must produce what he / she can and then gets back what only fulfills his / her needs .
That is as far as the individual identity is carried , because what is needed by he or she is not decided by the particular individual .
Issues of individual liberty are central as the State endorses certain classes of society which it deems necessary to increase in status ( distribute wealth to ) while the people from which that wealth ( private property ) is taken have their status decreased .
A societal process after revolution summed up within Marx ' slogan demands that when applied , redistribution of wealth be controlled explicitly by the State government .
Appropriations are entertained if they increase the might of the centralized authorities in control .
State enforced equality by way of money appropriations facilitates revolution within Communism .
A clear opposite of the communism / socialist model would be a democracy with capitalism fostering personal responsibility of a good or service that has prices based on the many individuals within the free market of a specific nation .
Individuals attain this involvement in the free market by having equal access to honest financial opportunity and equal protection under the law based on individual character .
Social Characteristics
Religion
Although Communism has a very complex relationship with religion , it is generally the most anti-religious ( and therefore atheist ) ideologies .
Lenin said :
“ Atheism is a natural and inseparable part of Marxism [ 13 ] ...
Religion is the opium of the people . [ 14 ] ”
Similar sentiments have been voiced throughout history by such prominent Communist figures as Karl Marx [ 15 ] and Josef Stalin ( who brutally banned religion ) .
This is indicative of the overall trend within the Communist movement against religion , and it is one of the defining social stances of the Left .
Education
Communist education , particularly under Josef Stalin , was typically geared around indoctrinating children in Communist ideology .
Evidence of this practice can still be found in China and southeast asia .

America in 2009 is broadly supportive of gay rights , so why is President Obama “ living in 1993 ” ? said John Aravosis in AMERICAblog .
After ignoring all eight of his campaign pledges to the gay community , Obama is now going to extend some same - sex partner benefits to gay federal employees .
“ That ’s sweet , ” but also “ awfully convenient ” just as wealthy gay donors are starting to close their wallets .
Gay people are too " pissed off ” for “ cute photo ops . ”
The gay community has ample reason to be upset , said the Los Angeles Times in an editorial , as Obama ’s Justice Department defends the “ odious ” Defense of Marriage Act and Obama shows a “ curiously passive ” attitude toward ending “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” and other gay - rights priorities .
But Obama could be right that a “ hasty march ” toward gay rights could actually set the movement back by years .
Or maybe he just does n’t care too much about the gay community ’s “ bitter disappointment ” in him , said James Richardson in RedState .
Sure , being “ to the ideological right of former Vice President Dick Cheney ” on his issue ca n’t be comfortable for Obama , but while the gay “ pocketbook rebellion ” will sting , the small number of gays — unlike Latinos and evangelicals , say — makes them a pretty “ insignificant ” political “ identity group . ”
America appears to be at a point of reckoning with its long history of social and economic racial inequality .
How to close the large and persistent Black - white earnings and wealth gaps central to this inequality is not just Top of Mind , but one of the most pressing questions of our time .
This piece " Mortgages Made Simpler " by Richard Thaler , is a discussion of the proposed Obama Administration regulatory requirement that lenders offer consumers " plain vanilla " mortgages .
From the Treasury regulatory reform proposals ( page 66 ) :
We propose that the regulator be authorized to define standards for “ plain vanilla ” products that are simpler and have straightforward pricing .
The CFPA should be authorized to require all providers and intermediaries to offer these products prominently , alongside whatever other lawful products they choose to offer .
Traditional economics is based on imaginary creatures sometimes referred to as “ Homo economicus . ” I call them Econs for short .
Econs are amazingly smart and are free of emotion , distraction or self - control problems .
Think Mr. Spock from “ Star Trek . ”
Real people are not Econs .
Real people have trouble balancing their checkbooks , much less calculating how much they need to save for retirement ; they sometimes binge on food , drink or high - definition televisions .
They are more like Homer Simpson than Mr. Spock .
Call them Homer economicus if you like , or just Humans .
Behavioral economics is the study of Humans in markets .
Designing policies for Econs is pretty straightforward .
Because they are smart consumers and make good choices , the best policies give them as many choices as possible and simply assure that they have access to all the relevant information .
Humans , however , can use a bit more help , especially when the options are hard to understand .
I found the following description amusing : I like the idea that all consumers be offered a " plain vanilla " mortgage option , and also that many of the non-traditional mortgage products come with warning labels .
Of course most CR readers are probably " Homo economicus " and are free to opt out .
For years , Eli Roth ’s name has often been mentioned in the same sentence as that of Hollywood recluse Quentin Tarantino , whether it ’s the latter ’s involvement in “ presenting ” Roth ’s breakthrough horror flick Hostel or Roth ’s brief appearance in Tarantino ’s Death Proof .
In Tarantino ’s new WWII flick Inglourious Basterds , that relationship is taken to the next level as Roth has been cast in the key role of Sgt. Donny Donowitz , one of the elite group of soldiers led by Brad Pitt ’s Lt. Aldo Rayne .
Known far and wide as “ The Bear Jew , ” Donowitz is a baseball bat - wielding whacko from Boston whose M.O. involves using said bat to beat the living Hell out of any Nazi he encounters .
The plot involves the “ Basterds ” taking part in a secret mission to blow up a movie theater where Germany ’s top leaders have congregated for a movie premiere .
Besides playing Donny , Roth also directed the movie - within - a - movie “ Nation ’s Pride , ” which is premiering at the theater where all those Nazis are convening , starring award - winning German actor Daniel Brühl as German ’s top sharpshooter .
A few weeks back , ComingSoon .
net got on the phone to talk to Roth about his debut as a serious actor as well as the making of “ Nation ’s Pride . ”
ComingSoon.net :
It ’s hard to believe it ’s been two years since “ Hostel : Part II . ”
When did you shoot this movie within that period ?
Eli Roth :
This started in July of last year , exactly a year ago .
I started preparing for the role and training for the role , and I put on 35 pounds of muscle for the part as a featured character and then we kinda went to Berlin and was there for six months .
It was kind of a year after “ Hostel 2 . ”
CS : Did Quentin give you a lot of notice while he was writing it that he might have a role for you ?
Roth :
He was hinting about it around Thanksgiving of 2007 , but he was n’t sure what “ Inglourious Basterds ” was going to be at that point .
Maybe it was going to be a mini-series .
Then over New Year ’s 2007 - 2008 , we went to Iceland together and kind of at the end of that , he said , “ I think I ’m going to write ‘ Inglourious Basterds ’ as a feature . ”
Then in April 2008 , he was at my Passover Seder , and he ’d never really seen me as a Jew before .
He knew I was Jewish , but I ’m not very religious , but he ’d never seen me in that environment .
All my friends from Massachusetts were there , and my family , and we were jokingly doing the Passover Seder in our Boston accents .
Quentin told me later , “ You know , I ’ve been writing Donowitz and I ’ve been hearing your voice in my head and picturing you doing it .
I think you would be a great Donnie .
I really think you ’ll be great . ”
So he ’d been talking about it , but I figured , “ Alright , he ’s going to change his mind and who knows what the results are going to be .
” Originally , he had Adam Sandler in mind .
All of a sudden on July 2nd he gave me the script and then he was auditioning people , but he was not auditioning me , and it turns out that I already had the role , and he was just auditioning people to see if there was anyone who he liked better than me .
And then eventually , we sat down in the middle of July and he said , “ Look , we ’re going to Berlin , but Donowitz has to be a real 360 degree character .
We ca n’t just choke our way through it ; this is real acting . ”
I said , “ Well , Quentin , I would love to do that work and really prepare the character and do it right , but I want to know if I have the role first . ”
He was like , “ No , no , no , you got the role ! ”
And I said , “ Wait , wait , you ’re telling me that I have the role and I ’m going to be starring with Brad Pitt in the movie ? ”
He goes , “ Yeah ” and I was like “ Should we make a toast ? ”
And he ’s like “ Yeah , cheers .
Listen , I really want Donowitz to be played as if it was no big deal . ”
He had already made the decision so that was that .
CS : You ’ve done a bit of acting , but it ’s always been small scenes , so have you talked with any of the actors you ’ve worked with to find out what they do to prepare for a role ?
Obviously , it involves a lot of time before actually shooting .
Roth :
As a director , you have to know what actors are doing .
You ’re the one telling them what to do .
The actors ’ job is to come prepared to the set , but sometimes , if they ’re beginning actors or people who are non-actors , you have to teach them how to act .
I ’d never done acting myself other than acting like I ’m interested in some studio executive ’s notes ( Oh , snap ! ) but beyond that , I knew what to do .
I ’d just never done it on that level before .
Any kind of acting I ’d done before , it was just joking around , like having fun with friends .
A little cameo here and there , and I never considered it real serious acting , but it was something I was always interested in and always wanted to do , but my passion is directing .
That ’s what I ’ve always loved , but here I am presented with this incredible opportunity , and I said that if I ’m going to do this , I ca n’t just do a good job , it has to be great , and I have to do something so unique and spectacular that people will see it and feel that nobody else could have possibly done the role , which is Quentin feels .
I ca n’t let him down .
And I already know how people are going to feel about me .
They know I ’m friends with Quentin , and they ’re going to think I got a free pass doing this , and I know that Quentin ’s got a lot of friends and he ’s only going to cast people that he feels is best for the part .
I always wanted people to come out of the movie excited to see more from me .
I do n’t want them to go , “ Okay , he did n’t f*ck up the film . ”
I want them to go , “ Wow , we had no idea he could do that .
I ca n’t wait to see what he does next . ”
CS : At least it ’s not like M. Night Shyamalan where you ’re making your own movie and you giving yourself a main role .
Roth : Look , I like M. Night very much but I think when directors who are not established actors give themselves big roles in movies , people can walk into the movie with a strike against it , and that ’s why I ’ve never done that beyond small cameos .
Even then , I do n’t even take credit for it , I use a fake name , but Quentin said to me , “ Look , Eli , you have another career if you want it .
If you want to be a movie star , you ’ve got it .
You really can do it , and you ’re great at it , but I do n’t want to detract you from what I think you were meant to do , which is direct .
You do n’t have to worry about that . ”
How is it going to get better than this ?
Working with Brad Pitt , cast with the greatest actor in the world , working with Quentin , the greatest director and we ’re the closest friends .
I ’m never going to have a better experience .
He said , “ No , but now you ’ve permission to write yourself a part , to write a great role for yourself that you can act in .
You ’ve held your own opposite Brad Pitt on screen and you ’ve done a great job for me , so you have nothing more to prove as an actor .
You can do it now . ”
And that really freed me up creatively , thinking , “ Well , yeah , you know what ?
Now if there ’s a part in a movie that I want to do and I want to write for myself then I ’ll do it .
I ’ll write a big part .
And if I want to act in another movie , I ’ll do it , but only if it ’s something that I like so much that it actually stops me from directing . ”
CS : Do you actually see yourself going to do the auditions if you really want to get a part ?
Roth : Never .
I did n’t audition for Quentin Tarantino and he cast me against Brad Pitt .
I ’m not auditioning for anybody .
I have no interest .
I only have interest … if people want me for a part , if it ’s a director I really respect , I would meet with that director , but that ’s not who I am , that ’s not what I do .
I ’m a director , and even though I love acting , I have no interest in that whatsoever .
I ’m not interested in going after a part .
I think if someone wants me for a part and approaches me then I ’ll take it on a case - by - case basis and see what that part is .
Generally , I ’m really only going to write parts for myself or work with directors I really respect , or it has to be some really spectacular project .
CS : At this point , I have n’t see the movie , only the trailer , but I understand that Donny has a baseball bat and he hits Nazis in the head and then scalps them .
Is there more to the character than that ?
He ’s from Boston I assume .
Roth : Yeah , there were sequences we shot with him in Boston , but I do n’t know if those ultimately ended up in the film .
Who knows where those scenes might land ?
I have n’t seen the final cut of the film but there ’s a lot of stuff that everybody shot , character back story stuff , some of it ’s there , some of it ’s not .
My guy is a guy from Boston who gets every Jew in his neighborhood to sign his baseball bat with the name of somebody they ’re worried about in Europe .
The thing is that he does n’t want a machine gun , he does n’t want to shoot Nazis , he wants to beat them to death with a baseball bat .
He wants to feel it in his hands when he ’s busy pummeling them to death .
This character thinks of himself as a Jewish warrior , who is fighting on the behalf of those who ca n’t fight and for everyone who ca n’t be there .
When I kill that guy , I did n’t want people to think , “ Oh , this is Eli being a psycho with a bat , ” I want you to really feel that pain and that rage , which is very real .
There were branches of my family that were wiped out in the Holocaust .
My roots are from Poland and Austria , Russia , that ’s where I ’m from , and my grandparents who got out and survived , all the other relatives did n’t and got killed , so it was very real to me .
It was a very real , very personal role , and I held a great sense of responsibility in doing it .
It was n’t just an acting job .
CS : At one point , were you going to do some second unit work on the movie as well ?
Roth : Yeah .
Quentin did a whole film within a film that he had me direct .
I offered to Quentin while we were shooting , I said , “ Look , if you want to make Cannes and you ’re stuck and you need me to do some shots , I ’m there .
I want to work .
I do n’t want there to be downtime for me ” and he said , “ That ’s a great offer but I never do 2nd Unit .
I do all my own shots , but if you want to do ‘ Nation ’s Pride , ’ there ’s only two or three shots I want to do .
There ’s a specific story and they have to be a certain way but the rest of it is this battle movie .
I do n’t even know what it is .
I ca n’t even conceptualize it .
I ’ve got my hands full with ‘ Inglourious Basterds ’ and I do n’t even want to think about ‘ Nation ’s Pride , ' ” and I said , “ Well , let me do it ” and he did .
I flew out my brother Gabriel and in two days , we got 130 shots , the whole battle with people falling off buildings and gunshots , then Quentin was so happy , there was a third day he was going to do and he said , “ You just do it ” and then he was like , “ Eli , you just edit it , ” so while Sally Menke was cutting the movie , I was in the next room on an Avid .
While he was doing these character scenes I ’m not in , I went and I cut the movie .
I was acting and then sound mixing at night .
I gave Quentin five and a half minutes .
It ’s not coherent , because it ’s supposed to be broken up as if you ’re watching different scenes from a movie , but I did five and a half minutes of footage and all he needed was thirty seconds , but he said it really helped him conceptualize how he was going to do the ending and rewrite the ending .
I was so happy that I was able to give him “ Nation ’s Pride ” ’ cause now he has that in his mind ’s eye and know , “ Okay , when this moment happens , we walk in on this scene .
When that moment happens , we walk into that scene . ”
He was able to really choreograph the ending around the film itself , which is great .
CS : How weird is it directing a Nazi propaganda film , especially considering your background ?
Roth : I loved it , I loved it .
I thought , “ God , how could it be more shocking than ‘ Hostel 2 , ’ what ’s the ( craziest ) thing I can do ? ”
Cut to me going , “ More Swastikas ! More Swastikas ! ”
It was very satisfying .
If it was something ( anti-Jewish ) it might have been tough but it was a battle film , all to show how great the glory of the soldier and how this one guy can shoot three hundred Americans , so in the battle stuff , it ’s very campy , it was like people holding dust in their hands in very dramatic deaths , so it ’s all sort of done very over - the - top , but it was great .
I ’m shooting with the 1:33 aspect ratio like the way Kubrick shot , shooting black and white and it looks spectacular .
I ’d never shot black and white like that before , I ’d never shot that aspect ratio .
It was so much fun .
CS : Generally , on a set like this , do you tend hang out with Quentin or trail him and watch him direct while you ’re not shooting or making “ Nation ’s Pride ” ?
Roth :
No , I ’m preparing for my scene .
I ’m thinking about what I have to shoot next .
There ’s a scene where I ’m machine gunning in a theater and there ’s a fire , and you have to look like you know how to reload a machine gun .
We had weapons training and I was practicing with the weapons , loading clips and unloading clips and changing .
I was really like a soldier at war .
Waiting for your next sequence , you want to make sure that every moment is right .
You know your beats , you know where you ’re going to be emotionally , all that stuff .
I was 100 % focused on it all .
CS : It sounds like “ Nation ’s Pride ” was done a lot like how you did “ Thanksgiving ” a few years back on your off - days from “ Hostel : Part 2 . ”
Roth :
It was exactly like that .
The “ Grindhouse ” experience was oddly a warm - up and a good audition for doing “ Inglourious Basterds ” because there I was , acting one week and then shooting the film - within - a - film and cut to two years later , there we are doing a much bigger version of that , being a big role in the film , doing real acting , and shooting a Nazi propaganda film .
I could never have done it had I not done “ Thanksgiving . ”
I did n’t know I was capable of doing it and moving at that speed .
I had the crew from “ The Reader ” and they were terrific but they were not used to working at that speed .
They had no idea that you could shoot that much footage at that level of quality at that speed , but it ’s all about being prepared and knowing what you want and moving fast .
CS : Do you have any idea what you ’re doing next ?
What ’s happening with your adaptation of Stephen King ’s “ Cell ” for instance ?
Roth : Nah , I walked off “ Cell ” kind of quietly .
There was sort of a difference in opinion on how to make to film and what the story should be , and a different direction the studio wants to go with it .
It was very friendly .
I mean , the Weinsteins , they made “ Inglourious Basterds ” so we ’re all friends .
I said , “ I ’m not really interested in doing the film this way .
You guys go ahead and I ’m going to make my own film . ”
I also learned that I really am only interested in directing original stories that I write , that ’s another thing I learned through that whole process .
I just want to write my own films and direct them .
CS : I wanted to ask about that , because Quentin writes his own material and it obviously takes longer between his movies because of that .
Is that something that worries you , not having a new movie every year or two ?
Roth : Having done a few movies back - to - back , I realized I do n’t just want to churn out these movies like a machine my whole life .
To do what I do , I have to do all of my own shooting but I also want to live my life and I want to have life experiences and write about those life experiences .
I have so many movie ideas I want to do .
I want to take my time , get the script right and then go make the best film I can and try to learn from each of those movies and try to do a better job the next time .
CS : Your movies have generally been very profitable just because you can make them for less money , but they still look great .
This new sci - fi project “ Endangered Species ” sounds like it ’s going to need a bigger budget , so is that the same thing about being prepared or will you need to approach it differently and have more time to make it ?
Roth : I ’ll approach it the same way I make any film , which is , “ What ’s the most cost - effective way to do it ?
What ’s the appropriate amount of money I need to make this movie look great ?
What resources am I going to need and how am I going to do it ?
And does the story and idea merit a budget of that size ? ”
If you ’re making “ Transformers ” than it ’s “ Yes . ”
If you ’re making “ Hollywood Homicide ” and it ’s $ 80 million , then it ’s “ no . ”
Having worked in production since I was 18 and doing budgets and schedules for a living to make money when I was in my early 20s , I know what movies should cost and I see where money gets wasted , and I have very specific ideas .
I have a very good sense and very good knowledge of how to save money , because I ’m so clear about what I want and that really happens in the writing stage .
Where you get into wasting money is when you do n’t know what you want and you keep f*cking around on set and doing reshoots and you do n’t make decisions and you ’re not sure how something is supposed to look and the sets are built the wrong way and you rebuild them .
That ’s where things get expensive , indecision .
CS : You ’ve been producing movies for other directors , too , so do you generally bring those same sensibilities to those projects ?
I know you ’ve been producing “ Cotton , ” not sure if that ’s finished or not .
Roth : Yeah , “ Cotton ” we ’re on post - production on that .
I love producing .
I mean , Eric Newman , we ’ve been wanting to work together for so long , we formed this company Arcade and we have a great time .
I love finding new projects , meeting with other directors .
I realize that it ’s very difficult for me to write and produce .
That ’s one of the great things about having a partner like Eric , who did “ Dawn of the Dead ” and “ Children of Men ” and “ Slither . ”
I can really hand the reins off to him , like when I was off making “ Inglourious Basterds . ”
But also , when he ’s off making a movie that he ’s producing , like most of these other movies that are without me , then I can take the reins .
We ’re very good at balancing each other out .
So I love it , because it ’s a great way for me to stay involved with horror movies or with genre films .
Like with RZA , he ’s got this amazing kung fu movie and right now , he ’s on tour , but we ’re going to meet up with him and start working on the script with him .
Half the time we ’re just getting the script really , really tight before he starts production on that .
I really enjoy it .
I love making my own films but I also love being involved with lots of movies , working with filmmakers I really like and new filmmakers and talent and finding cool projects and helping them get made , that ’s my favorite thing in the world .
You can also hear what Eli said about his lack of involvement with a “ Hostel : Part III ” and his general thoughts on sequels and remakes over on ShockTillYouDrop.com .
Inglourious Basterds opens everywhere on Friday , August 21 .
[ digg - reddit - me ] Matt Taibbi most famously posited that the financial crisis was the result of Goldman Sachs ’ self - interested manipulations .
He saw this single investment bank as the malevolent force behind the latest financial crisis – as well as speculative bubbles throughout history :
The world ’s most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity , relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money …
The bank ’s unprecedented reach and power have enabled it to turn all of America into a giant pump - and - dump scam , manipulating whole economic sectors for years at a time , moving the dice game as this or that market collapses , and all the time gorging itself on the unseen costs that are breaking families everywhere – high gas prices , rising consumer - credit rates , half - eaten pension funds , mass layoffs , future taxes to pay off bail - outs .
All that money that you ’re losing , it ’s going somewhere , and in both a literal and figurative sense , Goldman Sachs is where it ’s going :
The bank is a huge , highly sophisticated engine for converting the useful , deployed wealth of society into the least useful , most wasteful and insoluble substance on Earth – pure profit for rich individuals .
As over - the - top as Taibbi ’s description might be , it was n’t wholly inaccurate .
Putting aside the exaggerated , macho , Hunter Thompson - esque prose , and even Felix Salmon , a mainstream blogger and financial writer for Reuters , finds a great deal of truth in this portrait of Goldman Sachs :
I do n’t agree with all of Taibbi ’s article , but I ’m surprised at how much of it I do agree with …
Adding credence to this portrait of a massive bubble - making machine were the recent best - ever quarterly profits by Goldman in the midst of a recession for the rest of the country .
Graham Bowley and Jenny Anderson of the New York Times summarized this state of affair simply in their piece :
Most of Wall Street , and America , is still waiting for an economic recovery .
Then there is Goldman Sachs .
The free market digest
The Economist immediately saw the significance of these profits so soon after government aid :
For a firm that probably would have collapsed without government capital , debt guarantees and fast - track approval to turn itself into a commercial bank ( not to mention a multi- billion - dollar payout as a counterparty of American International Group ) , such largesse is cheeky at best , distasteful at worst .
It has already drawn rebukes on Capitol Hill , even though Goldman has repaid the government ’s $ 10 billion preferred - equity investment .
That Goldman Sachs was going to be a big winner in all of this was pretty evident as early as October when I included this as one of the 11 lessons I learned while trying to figure out the financial crisis : “ Goldman Sachs always wins . ”
What was evident already was that – as Russell Roberts pointed out in the Times – Goldman Sachs had “ won ” the bailout game :
It is deeply disturbing that Lehman Brothers was a long - time competitor of Secretary Paulson ’s former firm , Goldman Sachs .
It is equally disturbing that the chief executive of CIT , Jeffrey Peek , has been a contributor to Republicans rather than Democrats .
This could be mere coincidence .
But the current and ad hoc bailout strategy inevitably creates suspicion and destroys faith in our economic and political system .
Aside from Taibbi – who sees Goldman ’s tentacles at the root of most of America ’s worst economic moments through history – most observers do not see Goldman Sachs as the deliberate instigator of the current crisis .
They see it instead as an opportunistic organization – one that navigated through the crisis with aplomb – as it saw its rivals vanquished and as it shored up its own business .
It also played a significant role as the leader of the financial industry as it used political influence to push for various policies including a relaxation of regulation .
The oversize influence of the financial industry should be the next Theory of the Financial Crisis I cover .
But the key point now is that Goldman Sachs – if successful in opposing most common - sense reforms – will be substantially to blame for the next crisis .

Ah , the 1980s .
It was a time when our phones had to be plugged into the walls .
It was an era of bad music , big hair and a shrinking role for government in energy markets .
Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan introduced the free market to the energy market and they ran off in a ( mostly ) happy embrace .
Whether you think this development was ...
Commonly compared to the legend of Robin Hood , Salvatore Giuliano ( 1922 – 1950 ) was a Sicilian peasant famous due to stories pertaining to him helping the poor villagers in his area by taking from the rich .
The millennial subjugated social status of his class led him to become a bandit and separatist who has been mythologized during his life and after his death .
As a member of the Sicilian Independentist Movement , Giuliano actively pursued efforts into gaining independence for the island from the Italian government .
His story gained attention in the media worldwide , in part due to his handsome looks , including features in Time magazine .
He was born on November 16th 1922 in the western Sicilian mountain village of Montelepre which means " The Mountain of the hare " .
He was the last of a long line of Sicilian mountain bandits and the last of the " honorable " men .
The mountain bandits of Sicily have nothing to do with the city mafiosos .
They were a breed unto themselves with a special code of honor and morals .
They were truly the friends of the poor and they gave freely of their plunder of the rich to the poor .
Turridu ( the diminutive of Salvatore ) was no different and even today you will find older people in the mountain villages around Palermo who still sing his praises .
Salvatore went to school until the end of primary school at which time he had to go to work , but he did n't stop studying and went to the local priest and the local school teacher to continue his studies on his own .
He was a very well read man with a great amount of culture for a Sicilian " campagnolo " and he used his knowledge to help people .
Giuliano's life in banditry , like many , came out of necessity .
After his father death , his eldest brother provided wheat for Giuliano 's family , but he was called to war .
So it was up to Salvatore , just twenty years old at the time , to provide the necessities for his family .
He was inexperienced of the modus operandi used in moving the wheat and so on the 2nd of September 1943 , he ran into a patrol of two country wardens and two carabinieri ( rural police ) .
His prayers and explanations were of no use .
He was accused of smuggling two sacks of wheat of about forty kilos each .
They seized his mule and wheat .
They wanted to arrest and take him to the " American garrison " .
The young Giuliano tried to flee but the soldiers fired six times at him .
He was hit twice in his hip .
The carabiniero Giuseppe Mancino was ordered to finish him off , if he was still alive .
Giuliano , who heard this , leaped forward and wounded him seriously with a pistol which he had kept in his boot .
The soldier died of his wounds the following day , while Giuliano regained his full health after a month struggling for his life .
He then sought refuge in the hills around Montelepre .
And this is how Turrido became the last mountain bandit of Sicily .
In his politics he was anti-communist , anti-Mafioso and one of the leaders of the separatist movement in Sicily .
He was vilely murdered in his sleep on the 5th of July 1950 by his own cousin under orders from the Palermo mafia dons .
TPM Reader JR :
I ’ll make this short .
Our daughter suffered for years in the United States with an undiagnosed case of Myasthenia Gravis .
Her doctors , including a neurologist in New York , failed to diagnosis her disease and dismissed the symptoms as psychosomatic .
Mind you , the symptoms , as we learned later , were classic for a young woman with this admittedly rare disease .
After receiving no useful care at an emergency room , she went to see our local GP who referred her to the local teaching hospital .
There , based on nothing more than a conversation and superficial examination , the UK equivalent of a new resident correctly diagnosed the disease .
Since then , she has been hospitalized for many weeks , given two very expensive courses of IVIG treatment , and had her thymus removed in major , open chest surgery .
Thankfully she is now much better and about to head off for a Ph.D. program in England .
Recently , we flew back to New York to consult with perhaps the world expert on Myasthenia .
After reviewing her symptoms and treatment he declared that the doctors in Scotland were doing all the right things .
He then asked how much this cost .
He had a bit of a hard time understanding that the cost was exactly zero .
By the way , I spent about two months paying various bills associated with that one visit to his office .
Quite a contrast I ’d say .
Sharp Early Returns from Kepler
Unlike the Cassini Saturn orbiter , which we looked at yesterday in the context of cryovolcanism on Titan , the Kepler spacecraft has but a single scientific instrument .
It ’s a photometer based on a Schmidt telescope design with a 95 cm aperture and a field of view larger than 100 square degrees .
Measuring brightness variations for over 100,000 stars , Kepler is the first mission that should be able to detect Earth - size planets in the habitable zones of their stars .
That made yesterday ’s news conference an eagerly anticipated event , but we have to remember that it ’s going to be a while before we start talking about terrestrial planet detections .
It takes multiple transits and much data analysis to make that possible , and a transiting world at roughly Earth - like distance from its star will demand several years of work .
Kepler ’s baseline mission is three and a half years , more than enough to make such detections , and the good news is that the instrument works .

The lightcurve of the planet HAT - P - 7 b shown at the news conference yesterday was dramatic proof .
It was based on a mere ten days of test data collected during Kepler ’s commissioning period , before science operations officially began .
And even before the instrument has been fully calibrated and its data analysis software fine - tuned , it was able to detect HAT - P - 7 b ’s atmosphere .
The level of exactitude in these measurements has everyone talking .
Here ’s William Borucki , Kepler principal science investigator :
“ When the light curves from tens of thousands of stars were shown to the Kepler science team , everyone was awed ; no one had ever seen such exquisitely detailed measurements of the light variations of so many different types of stars . ”
The paper on HAT - P - 7b is being published in Science today , describing work on a planet that is roughly a thousand light years from Earth .
It was a useful early target for calibration given that this gas giant orbits in a mere 2.2 days , a ‘ hot Jupiter ’ some 26 times closer to its star than Earth is to the Sun .
That makes for numerous transits in short order , and in this case offers observations of a planet that is hot enough to be glowing like the burner of a stove ( more in this news release ) .
Both initial transit and occultation were clearly visible as the planet first passed in front of , then behind the star as seen from Kepler ’s vantage point .
What we learn is that HAT - P - 7 b ’s atmosphere has a dayside temperature of more than 2350 degrees Celsius ( 4310 degrees Fahrenheit ) .
And here ’s the key :
The observed brightness variation is a mere one and a half times what would be expected from a terrestrial planet transit .
The prospects for terrestrial planet detections , in other words , have never looked better .
The NASA image above gives us an idea how the story will play out .
Here are planets graphed by mass and orbital distance , with plentiful representation at the high end and no planets of Earth mass or lower yet detected in the habitable zones of their stars .
We should be able to offer a significantly different chart within just a few years .

But despite the best efforts of Attila ( and the Venetians , who carted away the stones of their sacked home to build Venice ) , archaeologists have mapped the lost city , detailed in the current Science .
" Now we have a rather unique opportunity of finding an abandoned Roman city , " study lead author Paoli Mozzi of Italy 's Padua University told Science .
" Now we can really start to make some kinds of reasoning about the way the city lived . "
A combination of drought and aerial photography in July of 2007 conspired to reveal the location of Altinum , reports the team .
Infrared images showed how drought affected corn and soybean crops growing over the site , in turn revealing the streets , buildings and even the large canal that once ran through the middle of the vanquished city .
Cut through the 10 - foot rise of the town , the canal was a surprise , Mozzi says , suggesting Altinum was a mini-Venice before Venice .
" The right constellation of circumstances — a site that has not been settled since Late Antiquity , and a severe drought — have combined to enable these particularly illuminating photographs to be taken and interpreted , " says Harvard classicist Kathleen Coleman .
" Altinum was one of the most important cities in northern Italy because of its strategic position as a hub where routes over the Alps , around the top of the Adriatic , and down the eastern seaboard intersected . "
The city flourished " throughout the period of the Roman Empire , and it must have been very prosperous , since the Latin poet Martial mentions that the villas along its waterfront were as beautiful as the famed resort of Baiae on the Bay of Naples , " near Pompeii , Coleman says .
" It was also thought until recently that its marshy site meant that it did n't need any walls , but now we can see a substantial wall along its northwest boundary . "
An Italian tribe , the Veneti , settled the city around 500 B.C. , and by 131 B.C. , when one of Rome 's famous roads , the Via Annia , reached the city , it had become part of the Roman Republic .
" With a size comparable to Pompeii , Altinum is the only large Roman city in Northern Italy and one of the few in Europe that has not been buried by medieval and modern cities , " the study says .
After the city 's sack , the Venetians moved to islands just north of modern Venice .
Along with the surprising canal , other monumental structures visible from the mapping effort include a Roman theater , Odeon for musical performance , amphitheater , forum with shops and basilica for legal matters .
Archaeologists will consider targeted excavations of the important sites from the maps , Mozzi suggests .
Although archaeologists study ancient riddles , they are n't averse to modern methods to make discoveries , turning to chemistry , carbon dating , satellite and aerial photos to make advances in recent decades , such as the map of Altinum .
Even Attila the Hun could appreciate that idea .
The legendary warlord embraced new siege engines to scourge Europe during his reign , which ended in 453 A.D. , one year after the sack of Altinum .

Court rips San Carlos cops who broke into home SAN CARLOS
Police in San Carlos who heard that a man had been in a minor traffic accident and may have been drinking can't justify charging into his home with guns drawn by claiming they feared he was in a diabetic coma , a federal appeals court ruled Thursday .
Based on the evidence at hand , no reasonable officer could have believed it was necessary to break into Bruce Hopkins ' home and rescue him at gunpoint , said the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco .
The 3 - 0 ruling allows Hopkins to sue the two officers and the city of San Carlos over an August 2003 incident that began when he was driving home and got into what he described as a minor accident with another driver .
Both got out , looked at their cars , found no damage and left .
The other driver , however , followed Hopkins home , the court said .
She accused Hopkins of being drunk and telephoned police , saying she smelled alcohol on his breath .
Two police officers arrived , spoke with the woman , then knocked on the door and announced their presence but got no response .
One then cut a hole in the screen door , and the officers entered with guns drawn .
They found Hopkins in his bedroom , handcuffed him and brought him outside , where the woman made a citizen 's arrest .
A San Mateo County judge dismissed charges against Hopkins , finding that police had entered his home illegally .
Hopkins then sued for damages .
In their defense , the officers said they had learned in police training that a person in the early stages of a diabetic emergency might seem , to an untrained observer , to have liquor on his breath .
The appeals court was not persuaded .
The officers took no other steps to learn whether Hopkins needed medical help , the court noted - they did not try to telephone him or ask the other driver whether Hopkins was wearing a medical alert bracelet or showed other signs of distress .
Their explanation " would allow police officers to ignore the Fourth Amendment ( ban on unreasonable searches ) almost at will , " Judge Stephen Reinhardt said in Thursday 's ruling .
The court also said police were not entitled to rely on the other driver 's unverified complaint to enter Hopkins ' home without a warrant and arrest him on suspicion of drunken driving .
Hopkins ' lawyer , Anthony Boskovich , said Hopkins had lost his new job with a local school district because of his arrest and had taken years to recover from the trauma of seeing police point guns at him .
A ruling that justified the officers ' conduct " would have undermined the liberty of us all , " Boskovich said .
A lawyer for the officers and the city declined to comment .
As soon as the Obama administration - in - waiting announced its stimulus plan  this was before Inauguration Day  some of us worried that the plan would prove inadequate .
And we also worried that it might be hard , as a political matter , to come back for another round .
Unfortunately , those worries have proved justified .
The bad employment report for June made it clear that the stimulus was , indeed , too small .
But it also damaged the credibility of the administration ’s economic stewardship .
There ’s now a real risk that President Obama will find himself caught in a political - economic trap .
I ’ll talk about that trap , and how he can escape it , in a moment .
First , however , let me step back and ask how concerned citizens should be reacting to the disappointing economic news .
Should we be patient and give the Obama plan time to work ?
Should we call for bigger , bolder actions ?
Or should we declare the plan a failure and demand that the administration call the whole thing off ?
Before you answer , consider what happens in normal times .
When there ’s an ordinary , garden - variety recession , the job of fighting that recession is assigned to the Federal Reserve .
The Fed responds by cutting interest rates in an incremental fashion .
Reducing rates a bit at a time , it keeps cutting until the economy turns around .
At times it pauses to assess the effects of its work ; if the economy is still weak , the cutting resumes .
I ’ll be the first to admit that after nearly a decade of wallowing in the swamp of right - wing political insanity , my sense of what constitutes “ acceptable ” rhetoric is entirely skewed , so much so that when I see things like these sorts of absurd assertions from the Christian Anti-Defamation Commission that health care reform would lead to a Nazi - like elimination of the elderly , I barely even bat an eye any more :
This is nothing less than state sponsored euthanasia .
Hitler began his reign of terror by his application of the brutal , Darwinian ethic , “ survival of the fittest . ”
He started killing the disabled and infirmed because they were considered to be a burden on the state .
Hitler rationalized the killing of innocent people in an effort to advance his fascist , national socialist agenda .
In the name of doing what ’s best for the good of society , Hitler trivialized human life .
Ultimately millions ended up paying with their lives .
In the name of the public good , Obama and the Congress are on the same anti-Christian , pro-death path .
And the reason I do n’t even blink stems largely from the fact that this type of rhetoric is , in fact , perfectly acceptable to the Right – here ’s Rush Limbaugh yesterday :
They accuse of us being Nazis , and Obama ’s got a health care logo that ’s right out of Adolf Hitler ’s playbook .
Now , what are the similarities between the Democrat Party of today and the Nazi Party in Germany ?
Well , the Nazis were against big business — they hated big business .
And of course we all know that they were opposed to Jewish capitalism .
They were insanely , irrationally against pollution .
They were for two years mandatory voluntary service to Germany .
They had a whole bunch of make - work projects to keep people working , one of which was the Autobahn .
They were against cruelty and vivisection of animals , but in the radical sense of devaluing human life , they banned smoking .
They were totally against that .
They were for abortion and euthanasia of the undesirables , as we all know , and they were for cradle - to - grave nationalized healthcare .
This is why I have always bristled when I hear people claim conservativism gets close to Nazism .
It is liberalism that ’s the closest you can get to Nazism and socialism .
It ’s all bundled up under the socialist banner .
There are far more similarities between Nancy Pelosi and Adolf Hitler than between these people showing up at town halls to protest a Hitler - like policy that ’s being heralded like a Hitler - like logo .
As Glenn Greewald reminds us , just a few years ago when someone submitted an ad to MoveOn.org that compared President Bush to Hitler , MoveOn immediately removed the ad , everyone went completely insane .
But now you have Limbaugh , the most influential voice of the Right in the entire country , literally comparing the Democrats to the Nazis and nobody says anything because this type of rhetoric is some utterly common that it is not even considered newsworthy .
And , on a similar note , just what exactly does Glenn Beck have to do to get himself yanked off the air ?
Apparently , joking about poisoning Nancy Pelosi is likewise perfectly acceptable :
I wonder what it would be like , seriously .
I mean , if I could go , you know , to the speaker ’s shindig , would n’t that be great ?
What would it — oh , look , here she — oh , she is — wow — you ’re so much prettier and flatter and shinier in the face than I expected .
It ’s almost like you ’re two people at once .
So , Speaker Pelosi , I just wanted to — you gonna drink your wine ?
Are you blind ?
Do those eyes not work ?
There you — I want you to drink it now .
Drink it .
Drink it .
Drink it .
I really just wanted to thank you for having me over here to wine country .
You know , to be invited , I thought I had to be a major Democratic donor or a longtime friend of yours , which I ’m not .
By the way , I put poison in your — no , I — I look forward to all the policy discussions that we ’re supposed to have — you know , on health care , energy reform , and the economy .
Hey , is that Sean Penn over there ?
I know it cost me more than $ 30,000 to get in here , but hey .
Hey , I think I see Ed Markey , the author of cap and trade , right over there .
Like I said , my own sense of what sort of rhetoric is “ acceptable ” from the Right is admittedly skewed , so much so that , quite frequently , I do n’t even bother posting certifiably crazy things precisely because they are so common as to not even warrant the coverage .
But even by my warped standard , this type of stuff from Limbaugh and Beck is completely insane .
And yet , at the same time , it is also perfectly acceptable .
And that is what is really insane .
Windows 7 has finally been released to manufacturing .
You can catch my formal review at the InfoWorld Test Center , but suffice it to say I 'm not sad to see it go .
After two public releases and nearly a dozen leaked builds , I 'm sick of installing and testing what amounts to Vista R2 .
It 's time to move on to the next version : Windows 8 .
Of course , we currently know nothing about Windows 7's successor .
Microsoft is n't dropping any hints , and with Steve Sinofsky heading up the whole Windows platform , do n't expect this to change anytime soon .
But that does n't mean we can't start speculating .
Here are my top five predictions for Windows 8 :
[ Get the full InfoWorld review of Windows 7 RTM .
| Learn where multicore support makes a difference in Windows 7 . |
See what the competing Mac OS X Snow Leopard promises business and IT . ]
Prediction 1 : No more 32 - bit .
Microsoft has been juggling the whole 32 - bit versus 64 - bit equation for far too long .
Maintaining dual code bases -- even with copious source sharing between them -- is a real waste of resources .
We saw it first with Windows Server 2008 R2 .
Expect a repeat performance with Windows 8 , which will be 64 - bit - only .
Prediction 2 : Mesh is big .
Microsoft 's Live Mesh is a real sleeper technology .
I expected big things from this hybrid local / cloud synchronization framework for Windows 7 , but Microsoft chose instead to focus on build quality .
However , you 'll be hearing a lot more about it in the coming months as Microsoft continues to extend Windows into the cloud .
Prediction 3 : App - V makes its mark .
I 've already declared Windows XP mode to be a brain - dead way of implementing legacy compatibility .
However , given the time constraints associated with Windows 7 , Microsoft chose the easy route and put off the hard work of integrating application virtualization for another day .
Expect to see App - V come to prominence as the company seeks to further abstract its legacy Windows APIs from the core OS .
Prediction 4 : Windows gets fatter .
Forget all your MinWin fantasies .
The reality turned out to be quite different -- namely , the compartmentalization of Windows layers to map and remove dependencies .
Expect this work to continue with Windows 8 , but for the core OS model -- NT Executive supporting various runtime subsystem environments -- to remain relatively unmodified .
Windows 7 has shown us that incremental change is a good thing , especially at the kernel level .
There 's a reason why this latest iteration is so stable , and it has more to do with what Microsoft did n't change than any improvements it made under the hood .
Prediction 5 : Subscribe today .
The days of the shrinkwrapped package are numbered .
Microsoft is already flirting with electronic distribution of Windows via its pre-order program .
Expect this trend to continue , with Windows 8 available via a downloadable installer application that you receive after registering for you new Windows client subscription .
Note :
As with any predictions article , take the above with a grain of salt .
After all , with Google 's Chrome OS on the horizon , we may well find ourselves living in a Google - dominated world where the very idea of a non-Web - based OS seems anachronistic .
At least that 's what everyone keeps telling me .
Feminine looking men are often ridiculed and joked about .
But their days of anguish are over , because a recent research has discovered that women are most attracted to feminine men !
The study was carried out at the University of Aberdeen and consisted of 449 women who were shown many images of men ’s faces ; little did they know that these images had been manipulated : some men were given a more masculine look , while others were digitalized to look more feminine by raising arched eyebrows , changing jaws to be smaller and eyes to be larger .
Another factor was that half the images had men looking away from the camera , whereas the other half stared directly at it .
The women were asked to choose which men they would prefer for a long - term relationship .
The results found that every 3 out of 4 women chose more feminine looking men and opted for the guys facing towards the camera .
The research was led by Dr. Ben Jones from the Face Research Laboratory .
He explained that women perceive feminine men as honest , kind and good parents .
So the results are logical – women find these sensitive and loving men attractive when asked to decide on a long - term relationship partner .

Browsing internet was never same in all times .
Internet was developed by DARPA ( Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ) to share information on defense research between the connected universities and defense research facilities .
At that time , it was just email and FTP sites with Usenet where scientists had Q&As .
Later the idea took over the world and changed the way how people communicate to each other .
The fundamental requirement to surf the internet is a web browser .
Do you know when & who made the first web browser ?
and how & when other web browsers jumped in to make internet surfing better ?
Let ’s have a look back .
WorldWideWeb ( 1990 )
World ’s first web browser was called WorldWideWeb that was coded by Tim Berners - Lee .
In 1990 , it was the only way to see the web .
Berners - Lee wrote WorldWideWeb on a NeXT Computer during the second half of 1990 , while working for CERN .
WorldWideWeb was written in Objective - C.
It would browse https : space and news : and ftp : spaces and local file : space , but edit only in file : space as HTTP PUT was not implemented back then .
Mosaic ( 1992 )
Mosaic was a major improvement in web clients that made web browsing more friendly with features like icons , bookmarks and more attractive interface .
By 1994 , Mosaic had a user base of several million users worldwide .
It was also a client for earlier protocols such as FTP , Usenet , and Gopher .
Netscape ( 1993 )
Marc Andreessen , the leader of Mosaic team at NCSA , soon started his own company named Netscape .
Netscape released Netscape Navigator in 1994 .
Netscape Navigator became the most used web browser of its time and reached 90 % of all web use at its peak .
Internet Explorer ( 1995 )
Microsoft initiated the web browsers by launching Internet Explorer in 1995 ( influenced by Mosaic ) .
Internet Explorer was included with Windows that created tough completion for Mosiac .
Microsoft was able to get biggest share on web browsers peaked at 95 % by 2002 .
Open Source Mozilla Project : Open Source Netscape Communicator 4.0 ( 1998 )
Netscape started a project called open source Mozilla in Janurary 1998 .
Netscape made Netscape Communicator 4.0 Open Source in hope that it would become a popular open source project .
Opera ( 1996 )
After working with Telenor , Opera released its own web browser in 1996 .
It was Opera version 2.0 .
Opera never achieved widespread use as a desktop web browser .
( Opera Version 5 , I was n’t able to find screenshot of version 2.0 , if you know then please share in comments )
Apple Safari ( 2003 )
Apple publically launched web browser for their operating system , Mac OS X , on June 2003 named Safari .
Final version was included as the default browser in Mac OS X v10.3
Mozilla Firefox ( 2004 )
Dave Hyatt and Blake Ross started an experimental project ( Firefox ) as a branch of Mozilla project .
Firefox 1.0 was released in the end of 2004 .
Firefox project has undergone several name changes .
Initially it was named Phoenix but later it was renamed due to trademark issues with Phoenix Technologies .
Google Chrome ( 2008 )
Google Chome ’s first Beta version was released on 2 September 2008 for Microsoft Windows .
Google Chrome got famous because of it ’s light and simple looks .
This post reviews a paper by Nate Gagnon , Charles Hall and Lysle Brinker titled : “ A Preliminary Investigation of Energy Return on Energy Investment for Global Oil and Gas Production , ” published recently in the peer - reviewed journal Energies .
The lead author was my colleague for two years at SUNY - ESF and the second author is currently my Ph.D. advisor and has published numerous guest posts here on The Oil Drum .
See here for a list of previous posts relating to work by Dr. Charles Hall , and here to download a full - text PDF of this paper .
ABSTRACT : Economies are fueled by energy produced in excess of the amount required to drive the energy production process .
Therefore any successful society ’s energy resources must be both abundant and exploitable with a high ratio of energy return on energy invested ( EROI ) .
Unfortunately most of the data kept on costs of oil and gas operations are in monetary , not energy , terms .
Fortunately we can convert monetary values into approximate energy values by deriving energy intensities for monetary transactions from those few nations that keep both sets of data .
We provide a preliminary assessment of EROI for the world ’s most important fuels , oil and gas , based on time series of global production and estimates of energy inputs derived from monetary expenditures for all publicly traded oil and gas companies and estimates of energy intensities of those expenditures .
We estimate that EROI at the wellhead was roughly 26:1 in 1992 , increased to 35:1 in 1999 , and then decreased to 18:1 in 2006 .
These trends imply that global supplies of petroleum available to do economic work are considerably less than estimates of gross reserves and that EROI is declining over time and with increased annual drilling levels .
Our global estimates of EROI have a pattern similar to , but somewhat higher than , the United States , which has better data on energy costs but a more depleted resource base .
As the title of this article indicates , the authors estimate the energy return on investment ( EROI ) for global oil and gas “ production . ”
The first thing to note is that the calculation is actually for the EROI of global exploration , development , and production ( commonly called E+P or “ upstream ” ) – a much more comprehensive estimate than just production .
They estimate that the EROI of global oil and gas E+P in 2006 was roughly 18:1 ( above figure ) .
To establish these estimates the authors rely on three datasets : a ) the Energy and Information Administration ( EIA ) , and b ) the British equivalent of the EIA , and 3 ) John S. Herold , Inc. , a privately managed database consisting of data on total " upstream " costs ( i.e. all costs up to the point the oil comes out of the ground ) of publicly traded energy firms around the world .
The crux of their analysis depends on the conversion of money numbers into energy numbers .
Since global energy costs are not maintained in energy units , but in economic units only , they derived an energy intensity value for each dollar spent in the energy industry .
These numbers , derived independently for the energy industries within the U.S. and England , were about the same : roughly 20 MJ per dollar for both countries in 2005 .
The energy intensity numbers were multiplied by the estimates of money spent to get rough estimates of energy cost of energy production .
In addition to estimating the current upstream EROI of global oil and gas , they extrapolated three trends from their time - series estimates of EROI and show global EROI declining to 1:1 between either 2022 or sometime in the very distant future , with the best estimate being about three decades away .
To do this , the authors forecast linearly the historic trend of global EROI , which is , as the authors acknowledge , a forecasting methodology fraught with problems .
Nonetheless , the forecasts provide a thought - provoking view of what may happen if society continues along a " business as usual " path .
Linear extrapolations of historic EROI trends
The authors also attempt to answer the question “ What are the reasons for the decline in EROI estimates , especially since 1999 ? ”
They offer two solutions : 1 ) technology is seemingly being outpaced by depletion , and / or 2 ) increasing the annual drilling rate decreases the drilling efficiency .
The drilling intensity decreased during the early and mid 1990s when EROI was actually increasing , but has increased since 1999 .
This has led to a sharp decrease in drilling efficiency ( barrels found / produced per well drilled ) .
Their best guess is that both options are operational , a contention with which I am inclined to agree .
Improved technology is increasingly used in E+P activities , including , of course , drilling .
So the fact that the EROI of E+P has declined over the past 10 years indicates that easier - to - access resources , i.e. high EROI resources , are increasingly rare ( if found at all ) , because even with increasing technology and drilling efforts , we are witnessing declining EROI .
Lastly , the authors address the major assumptions they have made while performing their analysis .
This is a crucial step in most large numerical analyses and , unfortunately , one that is often overlooked .
The assumptions are :
1 ) “ changes in monetary expenditures indicate changes in energy expenditures . ”
2 ) “ energy intensities are the same the world over . ”
3 ) “ We assume a constant energy intensity in the US after 2002 , and constant energy intensity in the UK prior to 1998 because there are no data available for those time periods . ”
The second assumption is the most problematic from a scientific perspective because upstream costs vary widely from deep offshore , to tar sands , to shallow offshore , to onshore drilling .
The application of energy intensity numbers , which are derived directly from cost data , from one area of the world to the rest of the world is potentially flawed .
But in reality , this is a reflection of one of the conclusions the authors derive from their work , i.e. WE NEED MORE / BETTER DATA .
The fact of the matter is that although the authors had access to three extensive data sets , two public and one private , they were still able to access data for only 40 % of the world ’s oil production .
Furthermore , many of the data sets that are unavailable to public scrutiny are the most important , i.e. that from Saudi Arabia , Russia , Iran , and every other Nationalized Oil Company .
Some interesting quotes from the manuscript :
This [ Herold ] data base accounted for about 40 % of the oil produced in the world in 2006 .
What is clear in the Herold data base is that the amount of oil and gas produced per dollar spent between 1999 and 2006 shows a decline .
In 1999 the industry produced about one tenth of a barrel of oil equivalent ( boe ) per 2005 dollar spent globally in exploration , development and production .
By 2006 that number had declined to approximately 50 % .
Throughout history , men have worn hats as a way of showing how much better they are than other men .
“ I buy hats , ” a behatted man seems to say .
“ I am better than you . ”
In wartime , hats were a useful way of conferring rank , and ensuring that casualties were confined to the lower classes ( hence the famous command of “ Do n't fire till you see the tops of their heads ” at the Battle of Bunker Hill by William Prescott , a general renowned for only shooting enemy combatants who were poor ) .
During peacetime , hats have been instrumental for men to let the non-hatted know just who is wearing the hat around here .

Tell the Truth about Bad Writing
Over at Salon today , columnist Cary Tennis answered a letter that deals with a problem many of us have had to face before or will face in the future ; what to do when you are asked to comment on a terrible piece of writing Tennis gives an interesting answer .
After a literary object lesson in how writing is a series of arbitrary choices , he advises this " writer 's friend " to say nothing , to clam up and keep their relationship healthy by keeping art out of it .
I think Tennis ' response is amusing and wise .
But he 's also dead wrong .
As an editor at a world - renowned literary magazine , I send out thousands of personal rejection letters every day .
And I have discovered something valuable : writers want to know what you think -- you personally -- and they will always get over it if you tell them the truth .
If they do n't , then they are not writers , and they need permission to stop .
Professionals want cold - ass judgment .
They wo n't even feel your criticism .
They hear a thousand conflicting opinions about their work , and they just want honesty so they can establish a clear baseline .
Amateurs want to be taken seriously .
The criticism will sting and make them defensive and pouty , but they will secretly love every minute of it .
As long as you make it clear that you carefully read every word and did not flinch away from their terrible prose , they will secretly feel like superheroes , no matter how much they balk and bitch .
The " tell them nothing ! " approach is not helpful because any logical person who gets this response knows that this means that their writing sucks .
If you bake somebody a cake , and then ask them how it tastes , and they put their fork aside after eating a slice and say " I am not going to tell you , " then that means your cake tastes like foamy , frosted dogshit .
Criticizing a novel is a lot of work .
Generally , it is a quid pro quo affair .
I would only ask somebody to read and respond to my novel for free if I was willing to read and respond to their novel for free .
This is maybe five people in the world .
So here are your best options for what to say when somebody delivers a terrible piece of writing to you : 1 ) .
You need to read this out loud to yourself before you give it to me .
Record it and listen to it and then give it back to me with new edits .
Editing is the most painful part of writing , and you want somebody else to suffer instead of doing the work yourself .
Why do you want to nail me to a cross and spear me in the side ?
Why do you want me to die for your sins ? 2 ) .
I do n't have time to give you the criticism you need .
I suggest that you get together with a writing group of like - minded creative professionals .
There are problems with your writing , but they can be fixed .
I think the whole novel needs to be more like " Chapter X . "
However , I do n't have the expertise or the time to tell you how to do this .3 ) .
Even terrible writers , like Miracle Jones , sit down and bang out thousands of words every day , just to delete them , just to stay in practice .
To get accustomed to the physical act of writing .
To fight the fear !
Are you writing thousands of words every day and pissing them into the sea through a strainer , only sifting out the kidney stones , or are you saving every delicate excretion in a labeled glass jar ?
Why should I have to look at your hundreds of glass jars full of boring yellow piss ?
I want to see the perversions and the anomalies !
I want to see the rock shaped like a shark tooth that you squeezed out of your sensitive little hole after weeks of fevers and sobbing !
Show me what you are proud of !
I deserve your best ! 4 ) .
Your novel is not publishable .
If I bought it in a store , I would feel cheated .
That does n't mean it is not well - written or interesting to me personally , but it is certainly not in a sellable condition .
Are you writing for yourself or for others ?
If you are writing for yourself , then why are you asking me to read it ?
If you are writing for others , then why do n't you get a stranger to read this instead of someone so close to you ? 5 ) .
A professional editor makes hundreds of thousands of dollars a year .
I am not a professional editor .
I do n't know what is wrong with your book , but I know it has problems .
I wish I could tell you what they are and how to fix them , but if I could do that , I would quit my job working here at Jiffy Lube and peddle my sweet ass to Random House .
I 'd have college interns getting me coffee and fat , glowing egg - sandwiches every morning .
You would be embarrassed to ask me to read your novel .
It would be like asking a priest to bless your swimming pool .
NOTE : nobody is going to fuck you if you read their novel and say you love it .
Do n't even think about it .
Put it out of your mind .
They might fuck you if you read their novel and say you hate it , just to get weird revenge .
But love is not currency to an artist .
It is a thing to be mistrusted ; a false positive .
Tell the truth , and if they can't handle it , then they will never ask you for your opinion again .
You win either way , and by telling the truth , literature as a whole gets incrementally better .
And by teaching you to tell the truth , literature has done its damn job , however roundabout , however terrible the piece of writing .
I woke up at 6:15 am .
I really hate getting up early and I count it as one of the best parts of my traveling days that I do n't have to get out of bed until I want to .
Though in the effort of living life to the fullest I try to average a 9 am wake up call .
So 6:15 am is quite early for me .
At 6:30 a hostel employee knocked on the door and told me that they are waiting for me downstairs .
I was almost ready anyway , so I grabbed my bag and hat and rushed down the stairs only to be told that I had to wait until 7 am .
They only sent someone to make sure I was ready .
Since they are probably used to dealing with drunken backpackers I do n't hold the ... read more
The judge had described the case against Mr Jawad as an " outrage " A US judge has ordered the release of one of the youngest detainees at the US detention centre in Guantanamo Bay .
US District Court Judge Ellen Huvelle said Mohammed Jawad would be released by late August .
If so , he is expected to return home .
But government lawyers say they have not yet decided whether to pursue a criminal case against him .
Mr Jawad has been accused of injuring two US soldiers and their interpreter by throwing a grenade at their vehicle .
He was 12 when he was arrested in Afghanistan in 2002 , his lawyer says , but 17 according to the Pentagon .
He has been held at the camp for the past six - and - a - half years .
Criminal case Earlier , Mr Jawad 's lawyer , Jonathan Hafetz , told the BBC he was " cautiously optimistic " his client would be set free .
" They 've not produced any evidence so far and enough is enough .
It 's time for Mr Jawad to go home , " he said .
Deputy Assistant Attorney General Ian Gershengorn told the court the US was still deciding whether to pursue a criminal case against Mr Jawad .
Daniel Sandford , BBC News , Washington
The strength of Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle 's remarks in this hearing should caution anyone against assuming Mohammed Jawad 's story sets a precedent .
Just because he is going home next month , it would be foolish to assume that many others will follow immediately .
He is being released because the case against him fell apart at the military commission hearings when his confession under torture was ruled inadmissible , and there was little other evidence .
Though some detainees will follow a similar path to Mohammed Jawad other detainees have a stronger a case to answer , and their release will be more of a political decision than a legal one .
That would mean he could still be returned to the US , or have his repatriation delayed , to stand trial in a criminal court .
Judge Huvelle gave government lawyers three weeks to file the criminal case , but urged them not to do so .
" After this horrible , long , tortured history , I hope the government will succeed in getting him back home , " she said .
" Enough has been imposed on this young man to date . "
Mr Hafetz said it would be " another traumatising experience " for Mr Jawad and that the " nightmare will continue for no good reason " .
The Afghan government has requested that he be sent home and in October 2008 , a US military judge ruled confessions Mr Jawad had made were inadmissible because they were obtained under torture .
Closure pledge
In July this year , Judge Huvelle described the US government 's case against Mr Jawad as " an outrage " that was " riddled with holes " .
MOHAMMED JAWAD Charged in Afghanistan in December 2002 for allegedly attacking a US military jeep Claims his confession was obtained using torture US government 's case against him described by a judge as " riddled with holes "
Observers say that if Mr Jawad is returned to Afghanistan it could mean that other Guantanamo detainees will also be released .
Shortly after entering the White House , US President Barack Obama pledged to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay .
Since making the pledge , administration officials have been reviewing the case files of Guantanamo detainees in an attempt to determine which prisoners should face criminal trials , which should face military commissions , which should be released and which can neither be tried nor released .
Mr Obama has said he wants the camp to be closed by January 2010 .

From the ' patent threats ' files :
Linux users take note : Microsoft has signed another patent licensing agreement with a Linux using vendor .
In this new case , Microsoft has signed a deal with Melco Group the group that owns tech vendor Buffalo Technology .
The deal specifically deals with Buffalo's NAS ( network attached storage ) devices as well as Buffalo routers - both of which run Linux .
" While
we plan to increasingly adopt Windows Storage Server for our NAS
business , we also wanted to ensure that our open source and
Linux - embedded devices had the appropriate IP protections , " Hajime Nakai , director and member of the board at Buffalo in a statement .
" By
collaborating with Microsoft on a practical business solution , we are
able to provide our customers with the appropriate IP coverage , while
also maintaining full compliance with our obligations under the GPLv2 . "
Microsoft has not specifically disclosed which patents it is licensing
to Melco - which is a cause for concern in my opinion .
I 'd like to have a system that can hold all the artifacts of a test execution and that also knows a lot about TAP .
Smolder is a good start as it knows about TAP but there are tons of other things I 'd like to have in it .
Some of them are hard to add , others are harder .
Anyway , earlier I wrote about Reporting Test Results .
Now let me write about my wish - list : 1 ) I 'd like Smolder to collect all the artifacts of a test run .
Look at the data Buildbot collects or what is collected by the PostgreSQL test farm !
Each run has several stages and the actual test run is only one of them .
In a Test Reporting system I 'd like to have access to all the output and error files of all the stages .
2 ) The tests might create some additional log files , I 'd like to be able to include those too .
3 ) One major issue we have is test counting .
TAP encourages you to have a plan - the number of test units you are going to execute in a test run - so that it can check the number of actually executed test to that number .
Keeping the plan up to date is annoying , people do n't like it so many use no plan .
Some TAP producers do n't even let you plan ahead ( e.g. the ones I saw in PHP ) but I think generally those that are more xUnit like wo n't have a test plan .
In larger settings this plan does not even help as it does not provide any tools to avoid reducing the test plan accidentally along with a shortcut in the test script :
A developer can comment out several tests temporarily and adjust the plan for the time while he is trying to fix a bug forgetting to revert these changes after he is done .
Smolder could help a bit here :
On the first result report the administrator of the project should look at the reports and mark them as having the correct number of tests .
Then if Smolder notices a test report with a different number of test for the same test file it should raise an alert .
The project administrator can examine the change and decided if that is the new correct number of tests setting the new expected number to this or if it was changed by mistake .
4 ) History of unit tests .
If we would like to be able to provide a history based on the actual test units ( calls to an ok ( ) function ) then we need to have some unique identifier for each test as we cannot assume that the test number or the test name will remain the same .
After all people sometimes insert new tests or remove old test at the beginning of the test scripts and the names can change .
Smolder could also help here too .
It could track the test numbers and test names .
If it sees a change it can alert the project administrator who can then use some GUI to connect the old test units to the new ones .
Both involves some manual work but I think large organizations will be ready to invest that work in order to get the benefit of greater control and better reports .
What would you like to have in your test reporting system ?
A former insider at Aipac has spilled the beans on a major secret initiative by The Israel Project ( TIP ) designed to counter opposition in the US to Israeli settlements in the occupied territories .
Douglas Bloomfield , former chief lobbyist for Aipac , writes that TIP , a group dedicated to promoting Israel 's positive image among the US media and policymakers , has circulated a 140 - page primer designed to prompt supporters in their exchanges with US journalists and key decision - makers when they are arguing in favour of the settlements :
If you can't convince 'em , accuse 'em .
That 's the advice from The Israel Project ( TIP ) for pro-Israel activist . …
Rather than try to defend Israeli settlements , change the subject .
If that does n't work , try accusing those who advocate removing Jewish settlements of promoting " a kind of ethnic cleansing to move all Jews " from the West Bank .
TIP calls that " the best settlement argument " in its 2009 Global Language Dictionary .
You read the full document posted on Newsweek 's site [ PDF ] , and includes a preface by its author , the Republican pollster and spin doctor Frank Luntz .
What is especially instructive about the document is that it concedes that Israel is on the defensive here in the US .
It conveys a recognition that the new Obama administration policy on Israel has caused a sea change for the pro-Israel community .
Instead of being on the offensive , always pressing its case , the lobby , perhaps for the first time , is in crisis mode .
Bloomfield continues :
" The single toughest issue " to defend among Americans generally and American Jews in particular is settlements , says the manual , and " hostility towards them and towards Israeli policy that appears to encourage settlement activity .
…
Public opinion is hostile to the settlements – even among supporters of Israel . "
Groups like TIP are not known for paying very close attention to truth or facts , and they do n't disappoint here , according to Bloomfield :
TIP says the " best argument " for settlements is this : Since Arabs citizens of Israel " enjoy equal rights , " telling Jews they can't live in the Palestinian state " is a racist idea . "
In fact , Palestinian prime minister Salam Fayyad just last week invited settlers to remain in the West Bank after it becomes part of a Palestinian state with full rights .
Rabbi Menachem Froman , a founder of Gush Emunim who lives in Tekoa on the West Bank , advocates a similar approach .
What is unique about Froman 's stance is his awareness that it is important for him to live in the West Bank as a Jew rather than as an Israeli .
He sees what he is doing as a religious rather than political imperative .
And his claim is that if you really believe in living on this land you will not care who rules you , since ultimately it is God and not a government that does so .
The fact that Froman recently met with a senior US Middle East envoy in Washington indicates how open the Obama administration is to hearing hitherto marginal voices .
To indicate how closely American Jewish groups like TIP coordinate their message with Israel 's diplomatic and intelligence agencies , Haaretz reports that Bibi Netanyahu met recently with the German foreign minister and in a masterful bit of guilt and manipulation told him that it was inconceivable to Israel that the West Bank could be " Judenrein " .
Similarly , the false argument that dismantling settlements amounts to " ethnic cleansing " is a tried and true settler argument .
It too involves grossly abusing the contemporary language of human rights in order to convert a simple political exercise ( a territorial compromise with the Palestinians ) into an act of racist violence against the people of Israel .
Bloomfield notes another specious argument in the TIP manual : " It falls back on the old and disproven argument that ' the settlements are necessary for the security of Israel . ' "
By no measure can anyone claim that the settlements improve Israel 's security .
In fact , violence perpetrated by extremist settlers against Palestinians is a continuous source of friction , which forces thousands of IDF personnel to be stationed there to protect Jewish residents as they pursue their campaigns .
Palestinians see the settlements and the occupation in general as painful reminders of their disenfranchisement .
This in turn fuels acts of terrorist violence against settlers , which are often repaid in kind by Jewish extremists .
Security ?
I think not .
Americans for Peace Now's Ori Nir places the issue in a broader context , also contradicting the TIP claim .
" American Jews increasingly realise that settlements undermine Israel 's ability to survive , long term , as a democratic Jewish state and that they undermine America 's national security interest in a stable , peaceful Middle East , " he told Bloomfield .
Barack Obama sees the settlements in this light , which is why he has made a full freeze a centrepiece of his policy .
Generally , congressional Democrats , even those known to side with the Israel lobby in the past , have adopted the administration 's position on the issue .
All of which must be a painful reminder to TIP of how low its fortunes have sunk in the current domestic political environment .
KUALA LUMPUR , Aug 6 ( Reuters ) - Malaysia is considering the establishment of an Internet filter , similar to China ’s abandoned “ Green Dam ” project , a source familiar with the process told Reuters on Thursday .
News of the proposal emerged within days of police arresting nearly 600 opposition supporters at a weekend rally denouncing a government that has ruled this Southeast Asian country for 51 years .
A vibrant Internet culture has contributed to political challenges facing the government , which tightly controls mainstream media and has used sedition laws and imprisonment without trial to prosecute a blogger .
“ They ( the government ) are looking to tweak the technical and legal details of implementing this Internet filter , setting the stage for its implementation late this year or next year , ” said the source , who declined to be identified .
No one from the government was available for comment .
“ Submissions are to be handed in by July or August .
About four groups have tendered for this project , ” the source said .
China last month delayed the introduction of its proposed Green Dam internet filter which authorities said sought to stamp out pornography .
Opponents of censorship , industry groups and the United States said the project was intrusive and unfair .
Malaysia plans to double home Internet penetration to 50 percent by the end of next year with a new broadband project .
New Information , Communication and Culture Minister Rais Yatim , whose ministry issued the tender , also plans to secure control over the content and monitoring division of Malaysia ’s Internet regulator , a second source said .
“ The minister wants to focus more on enforcement in the coming year , ” the source said .
Malaysia , with a population of 27 million , attracted foreign technology companies such as Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and Cisco Systems CSCO.O to invest and guaranteed that the government would not impose controls on the Internet .
Rais said last month that wider broadband access required more regulation .
“ With the good comes the bad through the broadband over the Internet , ” he said .
“ We will introduce certain measures to overcome the bad . ” ( Additional reporting by Royce Cheah , editing by Ron Popeski )
Children of the Atomic Bomb Who and Why : Dr. James Yamazaki in His Own Words Dr. James N. Yamazaki , at the age of 33 in 1949 , was the lead physician of the U.S. Atomic Bomb Medical Team assigned to Nagasaki to survey the effects of the bomb .
This bomb was a deliberate act of destruction that destroyed human bodies , brains , and genes for generations .
The human and physical toll , for all mankind , speaks for itself .
Yet , in the 21st century , nations continue to jockey for the control and manufacture of even more nuclear weapons .
Dr. Yamazaki , today in his 90s , continues to monitor “ the children of the atomic bomb ” and to write and to speak out on behalf of a humankind facing nuclear destruction .
Hiroshima and Nagasaki : Two Cities , One Destiny On 8:15 A.M. on August 6 , 1945 , the nuclear weapon " Little Boy " was dropped on the city of Hiroshima , followed seventy - six hours later on August 9 by the detonation of the " Fat Man " nuclear bomb over Nagasaki .
In a blinding , searing flash of light , one bomber and one bomb instantly blasted the two cities to rubble .
The great difference between the devastation of the two cities was a result of the different topography .
Hiroshima was on a low flat delta interlaced by seven tributary rivers ; Nagasaki was divided by a mountain spur into two distinct valleys .
In Hiroshima , the bomb exploded over the center of the city , destroying everything in a one - mile radius .
In Nagasaki , the bomb was detonated in an industrial valley flanked by a mountain spur so that the total destruction took place within a half a mile that shielded the major business and residential districts .
Yet the more powerful Nagasaki bomb of 20 kiloton ( TNT equivalent ) compared to the 15 kiloton Hiroshima bomb caused a far greater radius of damage than in Hiroshima .
The Human Toll
The nature of an atomic explosion explains the magnitude of the human casualties in the immediate and delayed aftermath .
A measure of the enormity of the energy released by atomic weapons is that the light of the bomb in brightness is comparable to the sun , and the temperatures and pressure are comparable to those in the sun ’s interior .
The light rays consist of thermal radiation that burns the cities and bodies and nuclear radiation that penetrates the body .
In the immediate aftermath , a quarter to a third of the population was killed by burns , trauma or radiation , or by a combination of these .
The principal delayed effects of radiation concern the development of cancer , especially among those exposed in early childhood compared to adults ; the brain damage to the fetus born to mothers exposed to the atomic bomb ; and the genetic effects to the children born to the survivors .
Living With the Bomb What is an Atomic or Nuclear Bomb ?
A general name given to any weapon in which the explosion results from the energy released by a reaction involving atomic nuclei , either by fission — of uranium or plutonium ; or , fusion — of a heavier nucleus with two lighter hydrogen ones .
Thus , the A - for atomic bomb , and the H , for hydrogen bomb are both nuclear weapons .
In the history of the modern world as we know it , the atomic bomb was only used once to kill human beings : it was dropped on the Japanese people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 .
Nuclear States , Nuclear Stakes Behind any discussion of radiation must necessarily loom the specter of full - scale atomic war .
That a single thermonuclear weapon can cause severe radiation damage hundreds of miles beyond its area of immediate devastation is all too well known .
That enough such weapons exploded in an all - out war might render the entire earth , or large parts of it , uninhabitable , is at least conceivable .
The nuclear stakes are global : life - maintaining and life - diminishing decisions must be made by informed individuals , communities , and nations today .
Children of the Atomic Bomb Survivors
Seventy thousand new - borns were examined in Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
In Nagasaki , 500 - 800 babies were examined in their homes .
No evidence of genetic injuries were detected at that time .
But today , in 2008 , new studies done on survivors and their offspring are revealing conclusive DNA genetic changes and malformations .
These studies utilize newer modalities to detect DNA injuries .
The children of survivors , now adults , are concerned how genetic damage from the bomb may be transmitted to their children through generations .
Aside from the physical injury and radiation the most significant effect of the atomic bomb was the sheer terror which it struck into the citizens of these bombed cities .
Such terror , unprecedented in humankind , was etched forever onto the bodies and minds of the persons who experienced it .
The tragedy of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is not just Japan ’s , but it is the world ’s .
Therefore , it is the responsibility of all nations to prevent another nuclear disaster for the safety and well - being of all our children .
Today : 159,000 Hiroshimas !
Aside from the the physical injury and radiation the most significant effect of the atomic bomb was the sheer terror which it struck into the peoples of the bombed cities .
Today , the U.S. nuclear stockpile contains 2,400 megatons , the equivalent to 159,000 Hiroshimas !
An enormous nuclear caldron simmers that adds fire to current threats of global warming and changes in our water , atmosphere , and the delicate human , animal , and food chain through which we are all interlinked .

BOSTON July 30 , 2009  -- A Boston police officer and National Guard commander has been suspended from the force and stripped of his Army command after admitting that he called Harvard University Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. a " jungle monkey " in an email .
Justin Barrett , 36 , a two - year BPD veteran , could be fired as early as this week , Boston Police spokeswoman Elaine Driscoll said .
Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis held a news conference today to denounce the language in Barrett 's email , calling it " venomous rhetoric " and " inflammatory . "
The commissioner said such behavior " will not be tolerated . "
Davis said he has begun a termination hearing that could last a week to 10 days .
The commissioner also said he regretted the comments made about Gates .
" I personally reached out to him to apologize for this offense , " the commissioner said .
Davis ' news conference included religious and black leaders who also condemned Barrett 's comments and tried to soothe racial feelings .
The also warned that such prejudice must be eliminated from the ranks of police .
" Everybody knows one flat tire will stop a car , " said the Rev. Don Mohammed .
He wrote the email in response to an editorial Boston Globe columnist Yvonne Abraham that ran last Thursday , Barrett 's lawyer , civil rights attorney Peter Marano , told ABC News .
" He was angry at the column .
He wrote a private email to friends from a private computer , '' Marano said .
" It was not his brightest moment . "
Barrett admitted to Boston Police brass that he wrote the email , and was immediately stripped of his gun and badge by Police Commissioner Ed Davis .
Tom Nee , president of the Boston Police Patrolmen 's Association , said he was disgusted by the language .
" He is not representative of the men and women of the Boston Police force , '' Nee told ABC News .
" Justin Barrett has done more to hurt the police force than Gates did .
" Two wrongs do n't make a right , '' Nee said .
Gates was arrested on July 16 for disorderly conduct after police arrived at his house on a report of a possible burglary .
The charges were later dropped , but the arrest triggered a racial furor that reached as high as the White House .
The black scholar says the officer , Sgt. James Crowley , ignored Gates ' request for his name , while Crowley said the professor accused him of being racially motivated and uncooperative .
The dispute embroiled the presidency when President Obama said the police acted " stupidly . "
Obama , Gates and Crowley hope to end the furor over beers at the White House today .
Tensions between the public and police in Massachusetts have risen since the arrest of Gates .
Many police officers continue to harbor resentments about Obama 's remark , and civilians have derided cops as " racists " in basic encounters on city streets , Boston police officers have said .
[ In the latest in his popular Game Design Essentials series , which has previously spanned subjects from Atari games through ' mysterious games ' , ' open world games ' , ' unusual control schemes ' and ' difficult games ' , writer John Harris examines 10 games from the Western computer RPG ( CRPG ) tradition and 10 from the Japanese console RPG ( JRPG ) tradition , to figure out what exactly makes them tick -- and why you should care . ]
Introduction : ( Original ) Dungeons & Dragons
Designed by : Gary Gygax , Dave Arneson
Influenced by : Braunstein , a game that Dave Arneson is known to have played , predated D&D .
There were also weird fiction and pulp fantasy stories and tabletop war games dating back to H.G. Wells ' floor game Little Wars .
Series :
No less than seven editions and many side - products .
Not to mention all the CRPGs that claim to be derived from its rules .
Also , those CRPGs that steal mechanics from it without attributing them .
Legacy : Nearly all RPGs .
Although it 's not a CRPG , let 's begin with a discussion of the original role - playing game , the edition of Dungeons & Dragons that started the role - playing game craze in 1974 .
It might not seem relevant to the discussion , but there are some things about the RPG genre that only really make sense when viewed in comparison with this particular game .
It may not actually have been the first role - playing game ; word is that Dave Arneson participated in another game prior to its release .
But D&D 1974 , referred to among fans on the ' net as " OD&D , " was the introduction of RPGs to practically everyone else .
First : the term " role - playing game , " it seems , was not used in the original set .
A search through the books and supplements of the OD&D game show a good number of uses of the word " role , " as a general term for a character played by either a player or the referee , but none for " role - playing game . "
Neither is it used in any of the supplements .
The earliest published use seems to be either the Holmes version of the game , which slightly predates AD&D , or the last issue of TSR 's early publication The Strategic Review , where it 's used in describing their shiny upcoming magazine The Dragon .
Until then , it seems there may have been no good name for what Dungeons & Dragons was .
This is important because " role - playing game " is one of those terms that is proscriptive in its use .
It implies that players , to an extent , personify their characters .
D&D arose out of a marriage between wargaming and fantasy fiction , so narrative is in its blood , but early on the most frequent type of adventure was a simple free - form dungeon crawl .
If you count OD&D as a role - playing game , then you necessarily have to admit that RPGs do n't have to be games of storytelling , or at least not games of " top - down , " DM - driven storytelling .
( RPGs have always been games of what we might call " storywriting " . )
In this sense computer versions have more in common with early social roleplaying sessions than later ones .
Few people play CRPGs with an eye towards acting out their characters ' roles .
Second thing , the game was hard .
Really hard !
Characters dropped like flies !
Only a small percentage of characters would ever reach level two .
That might seem harsh , because it was , but it did n't chase players off because people did n't identify as strongly with characters .
One tends not to get attached to characters who stand a good chance of not making it out of their first trip into the dungeon .
Without storytelling , and with the game 's much - simpler system -- compared , even , to AD&D 1st edition , which is not really all that dissimilar to OD&D with all the supplements applied .
This is important because many early CRPGs , and even some early JRPGs , took a similar attitude to character death .
The Wizardry - influenced style of game makes death common , especially at low levels .
Wizardry charges a good deal to revive a dead character , the process has a good chance of failing , and if it does it costs even more to try to revive the pile of ashes the corpse becomes .
The roguelike genre continues to hold up the tradition to this day .
Third thing , the game had a strong setting and a reduced scope .
OD&D is a game about exploring dungeons , and other dangerous places , and that 's mostly it .
High - level characters may get the opportunity to start their own little fortress or tower , but with level nine , " name level , " so far away and the game so deadly , this is n't something a player can do more than hope to reach .
Because dungeon exploring is ultimately a loot - harvesting game , and treasure can be obtained in ways other than fighting , characters gained one experience point per gold piece acquired .
This knowledge can seem surprising to us computer gamers today , as nearly every CRPG that uses an experience system anymore doles it for fighting alone .
The XP - for - gold rule implies strongly that the DM must carefully guard his riches and not hand out gold on a whim .
This need led , at times , to a kind of DM vs. players rivalry .
If a DMs failed to realize this they could end up subtly nudged towards giving out extra wealth , leading to what became known as " Monty Haul " campaigns , with vast amounts of treasure distributed for little work .
Second edition remedied this by switching to all combat - based experience , offering treasure XP as an option , as well as XP for completing quests .
Handing out experience points for collecting gold fits in with the ' 20s and '30s pulp fantasy works that inspired the game , which are fairly gritty tales with heroes are mostly in it for personal enrichment .
Characters in pulp fantasy are , by D&D standards , fairly weak .
Even the most powerful ones , like Conan , face significant danger from some angle or another , in his case from magic and gods .
OD&D characters are never completely safe , at least not if the DM is competent .
So , why is this important ?
Because this attitude , that role playing is a game of loot acquisition first , is everywhere in early computer RPGs .
Even those with strong save - the - world quests have a lot of loot gaining along the way .
It also explains those " strange " games , like PLATO dnd , that allow characters experience , or even direct improvement , for the simple act of money - harvesting .
Fourth thing : OD&D did not include a mandatory combat system .
The first books referred players to Chainmail , a prior game of Gygax 's , for ideas for how to resolve battles .
It had a section marked " Alternate Combat System " that would later become the standard combat mechanism D&D would use for years , but Chainmail was the official solution , and besides its use of armor class and hit points , its rules were quite different from what is now seen as standard D&D combat .
This is important because it shows is that combat play , ultimately , was not considered the defining aspect of the game .
It was a replaceable system .
When played with Chainmail , D&D looks a lot like a special form of wargame campaign .
This may well be a contributing factor to the strong split between " exploration mode " and " combat mode " that many RPGs use to this day .
OD&D did n't get the system that would ultimately become the combat method used in AD&D 1st edition , and later mutated into the " d20 System , " until the first supplement , under the heading " ALTERNATIVE COMBAT SYSTEM . "
Related to this is the fifth thing , and perhaps the most important of all : OD&D was poorly explained .
It is impossible to play Original Dungeons & Dragons with just the first three rule books , and even the supplements left important things out .
Gygax and Arneson wrote for a presumed audience of wargamers .
It still managed to become popular because the game primarily spread by word - of - mouth .
People did n't learn from reading the books ; they learned from other people , and thus the rules of the game followed the principles of oral tradition , with the rules used as reference .
This is important because it let a hundred rulesets thrive .
Different regions tended to play the game in different ways .
When more rigorous rules were written , some people decided they liked their old system better and invented competing RPGs , codifying those rules , to compete with D&D .
It is this very proliferation of rules that produced the wide variety of games and approaches among early CRPGs .
I am not trying to argue that the game was better or worse than present - day RPGs .
It is not hard , really , to find people who would say otherwise ; there is a burgeoning field of " retro- clone " RPGs out there whose purpose is to make games very much like those old systems .
But the original game of Dungeons & Dragons was surprisingly different from what we remember today , and it turns out that many of the oddnesses of RPG gaming , some persisting right up to the present , have their roots in its evolution .

NEW YORK , July 29 ( Reuters ) –
The sound money set remains concerned that the Federal Reserve ’s emergency actions to corral collapse could ignite hyperinflation .
In particular , they point to the explosion of excess reserves inside the banking system , which they call dry tinder just waiting for the spark of recovery .
Bill Dudley , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , says this is n’t an issue because the Fed now pays interest on excess reserves .
It ’s a good argument , but only in the short run .
To liquefy the banking system , the Fed drastically expanded its balance sheet , which , as you can see in the chart to the right , has led to an explosion of excess reserves at banks .
( Click chart to enlarge in new window )
For decades they never rose above $ 10 billion .
Now they ’re above $ 700 billion .
To understand why this level of excess reserves has some worried about hyperinflation , it helps to understand what they are .
The Fed requires banks to keep a certain level of assets in reserve against deposits , either cash in the vault or reserves held at the Fed .
Reserves held over this required amount are referred to as “ excess ” reserves which banks are free to lend out .
When banks lend money into the economy , the money borrowed typically ends up as a deposit in another bank .
Say I borrow to buy a house ; the mortgage I get from the bank is money I give to the seller , who then deposits the cash in his own bank .
Lent money turns into a new deposit , which turns into more lent money , which turns into another deposit , and so on .
As the supply of money multiplies , you get inflation .
If it multiplies too quickly , you get hyperinflation .
The multiplication of money that might come from banks lending out over $ 700 billion of excess reserves is the stuff of inflationary nightmares .
But banks are n’t lending it out .
Why not ?
As Dudley points out in his speech , it ’s because the Fed is now paying them an interest rate .
Before last October , banks lent out all their excess reserves .
After all , excess cash in the vault earns the bank no profit .
But then Congress gave Ben Bernanke the power to pay interest on excess reserves , which means banks now can earn a return by keeping them on deposit at the Fed .
Money that could be lent is n’t , inflation remains a potential threat , not a kinetic one .
But there ’s a catch .
When the economy recovers banks wo n’t any longer want to keep their excess reserves on deposit at the Fed , not unless the Fed is willing to pay a much higher interest rate .
Walker Todd of the American Institute of Economic Research argues that “ the economy wo n’t be able to handle the high interest rates the Fed will be forced to charge in order to keep excess reserves immobilized in its vault . ”
The Fed argues it has other tools to shrink its balance sheet when the time is right .
For one , its emergency lending facilities are priced high enough such that banks will stop drawing on them when the economy recovers .
But even after its lending facilities are wound down the Fed acknowledges the level of excess reserves will still be huge .
To keep them immobilized will require substantially higher rates .
But raising rates will cause asset prices to plummet .
Weak balance sheets will collapse and the financial crisis could return in full force .
This is the conundrum the Fed faces .

My grandmother was a pretty fly lady , though I am not sure anyone called her “ fly ” in her lifetime .
She loved anything glamorous and I ’m pretty sure she saw the point of doing a whole lot in moderation .
She ’d send my sister and I ( beware , frightening New Jersey - in - the - 80s references ahead ) glittery and puff - painted jaw clips and manes from the flea markets in Florida , she never discouraged the splattered and acid - washed jeans and neon slouch socks I wish someone would have formed an intervention over ( shudder ) and I specifically remember her finding me a pair of silver moccasins that in my mind could n’t have been any cooler .
So , it should come as no surprise that when she made brownies , she did n’t just make any old brownies .
Instead , they were three layer affairs ; one chocolate , one mint and then a chocolate topping and she did n’t just stop there .
Nope , Grandma took an Andes Candy , divided it in half on the diagonal , and sank it like a shark fin into that chocolate and her “ creme de menthe brownies ” were possibly the most glamorous thing I had ever seen and my favorite brownie to eat .
I unearthed the recipe a few years ago — a thin brownie not heavy on the chocolate ( which came from a can of Hersheys syrup ! ) , a quick butter / powdered sugar buttercream flavored with creme de menthe and a melted chocolate chip topping — and I am so ashamed to say this , but they just did n’t live up to the memory I had of them .
I knew I could make tweak the recipe to make them better somehow , but it just seemed wrong .
But these … they ’re richer .
The chocolate flavor is more intense .
They ’re a bit neater and more compact and I would never call them “ better ” , I ’ll just say that this is the way I had always remembered the others tasting .
I do n’t think she ’d complain one bit if I handed her one of these instead of her version ; she ’d enjoy them thoroughly .
And then she ’d tell me to stand up straight , and perhaps wear some colors once in a while .
Lady , you ’re killing us with the sweets : I know , I know .
We ’ve been desserts overboard this month , but I ca n’t let you all go into the biggest baking weekend of the year without one last totally gorgeous and indulgent confection .
A fantastic dinner party dish is coming next ( I mean , I hope it is as delicious as the last time I made it ! ) and then some moderation .
Perhaps in the new year .
How else will we find cause for resolutions ?

I hope you do .
Two years ago : Robert Linxe ’s Chocolate Tart
Grasshopper Squares [ aka Creme de Menthe Brownies ]
Adapted from Gourmet , December 2005
I have one gripe with these squares :
The ganaches are too soft .
I honestly do n’t know why they require so much cream as they never really firm up , even in the freezer .
It makes for a delicious bite but not a whole lot of stackability or transportability .
What I would do next time is try to make the ganaches with half the cream and see if they firm up better — they should .
If you feel comfortable doing so ( you ’ll want to chocolate with the cream , rather than pour it over ) I have a feeling it will be a nicer consistency .
But even if you use the full amounts , you wo n’t be disappointed in the taste .
Final note :
With white chocolate , the quality is especially important .
The original recipe ’s comments on Epicurious are filled with complaint from people who used Ghirdelli and other white “ chocolates ” ( filled with artificial ingredients ) which split easily once heated and never came back together .
This has happened to me before when I used Ghiradelli .
Although pricier , both Valrhona and Callebaut make exceptional white chocolates ; I used the latter .
Makes anywhere from 72 normal - sized brownies to 117 one - inch squares ( I think the perfect size )
For brownie layer
1 1/2 sticks ( 3/4 cup ) unsalted butter
10 1/2 oz fine - quality bittersweet chocolate ( not extra - bitter or unsweetened and no more than 60 % cacao if marked ) , finely chopped
1 1/2 cups packed light brown sugar
3 large eggs , lightly beaten
1 1/4 teaspoons vanilla
3/4 cup all - purpose flour
1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons unsweetened Dutch - process cocoa powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
For mint ganache
1/2 cup heavy cream ( see recipe notes )
10 oz fine - quality white chocolate , chopped ( see recipe notes )
2 tablespoons green crème de menthe ( I skipped this and found the mint flavor strong enough ; compensated for the tinting with a single drop of green color )
1 teaspoon peppermint extract
For chocolate ganache
1 cup heavy cream ( see recipe notes )
10 oz fine - quality bittersweet chocolate ( not unsweetened ) , finely chopped
Make brownie layer :
Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 375 °F .
Lightly butter a 13 - by 9 - inch baking pan and line with 2 crisscrossed sheets of foil , leaving a 2 inch overhang on all sides .
Butter foil .
Melt butter and chocolate with brown sugar in a 3 - quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat , stirring occasionally , until smooth .
Remove from heat .
Whisk in eggs and vanilla until combined .
Whisk in flour , cocoa , and salt until just combined .
Spread batter evenly in baking pan and bake until set and a wooden pick inserted in center comes out with moist crumbs adhering , about 20 minutes .
Cool completely in pan on a rack , about 1 1/2 hours .
Make mint ganache :
Bring cream to a simmer in a 2 - to 3 - quart saucepan and remove from heat .
Pour over white chocolate in a bowl .
Let stand 1 minute , then whisk until smooth .
Stir in crème de menthe and extract and chill , covered , stirring occasionally , until thick , about 1 hour .
Make chocolate ganache :
Bring cream to a simmer in a 2 - to 3 - quart saucepan and remove from heat .
Pour over bittersweet chocolate in a bowl .
Let stand 1 minute , then whisk until smooth .
Chill , covered , stirring occasionally , until thick , about 30 minutes .
Assemble layers :
Spread mint ganache over top of cooled brownie in a thin even layer using offset spatula , then chill until firm but still slightly sticky , about 30 minutes .
Spread chocolate ganache over mint and chill until firm , about 2 hours .
Lift dessert out of pan using foil overhang .
Run a heavy knife under hot water and wipe dry , then trim edges of dessert ( 1/4 inch off each side ) .
Cut dessert into squares and peel from foil .

Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has said that he believes the generals and politicians now ruling Honduras have US backing , even if not from President Barack Obama .
Mr Chavez said Honduras ' military junta and political leaders " have Yankee support " .
He added in remarks to the TV channel Telesur that he's " not saying they have the support of Obama " and that he hopes the US president takes a stronger stance against the coup leaders .
He called it a " cowardly government " in Honduras after a Venezuelan plane carrying ousted President Manuel Zelaya was kept from landing by troops who blocked the runway .
Mr Chavez said earlier at a Venezuelan independence day parade that he hopes for an " awakening " by Honduran troops to restore Mr Zelaya .

From April 1 , 2008 through March 31 , 2009 , about 4,000 restaurants closed across America , reports market research company NPD .
( Thanks , recession ! )
Among the hardest hit by the economy are independent restaurants ( read : not chains ) , which saw an overall decline of 2 percent — a figure aided by the staggering closure rate of independent fine - dining destinations , which saw their numbers shrink by a whopping 7 percent .
NPD attributes the rash of closures to the indies “ having a hard time competing with the resources and marketing power of major chains . ”
That ’s putting it mildly .
[ NPD via BuisnessWire ]
After undergoing the trauma of separation and divorce , your ability to make decisive decisions may be impaired .
Quite simply , you may have lost faith in your intuitive abilities .
Trusting your instinct is an important skill .
Women have an innate sense of intuition , and this intuition can assist in all aspects of life , including business .
It can , quite literally , protect you and your family as well .
Stories abound about women who were successful in avoiding dangerous men or situations because they “ … had a bad feeling . ”
When women undergo a stressful personal event , their instinctual abilities are often lost .
However , there are steps that can be undertaken to re-awaken the intuitive sense .
A rare and mysterious syndrome that causes people to sound foreign has become even more baffling .
Until now , the condition has been linked with damage in certain brain areas , but researchers have found two people with no trace of brain damage who have nevertheless sounded foreign since childhood .
This could prompt neurologists and linguists to rethink the origins of foreign accent syndrome ( FAS ) and may even point toward a genetic cause , Peter Mariën , a neurolinguist at Middelheim General Hospital and Vrije Universiteit in Brussels , Belgium , who led the study with Jo Verhoeven , a phonetician at City University London .
“ There is no such thing as one simple recipe that explains what happens to a person who has foreign accent syndrome , ” he says .
Brain damage or developmental problems could occur in brain circuits responsible for the timing , tone and pronunciation of speech , causing accents to sound foreign .
“ They know perfectly what to say , ” Mariën says .
“ They have the idea , they have the concept , but the organisation of the articulation patterns is disrupted . ”

Ear of the beholder
People with FAS are n’t reverting to a childhood accent or one they picked up from others , says Sheila Blumstein , a cognitive linguist at Brown University in Providence , Rhode Island , who was not involved in the study .
They just sound foreign .
“ A lot of us have concluded that foreign accent syndrome is in the ears of the beholder , ” she says .
One person ’s Czech - sounding accent could remind another person of Russian and yet another of French .
In fact , studies of FAS patients have shown that listeners show little agreement in assigning an accent to a particular language .
That was certainly true for the people that Mariën ’s team studied .
Different listeners in a panel thought a 29 - year - old woman known as TL sounded French , German , Scandinavian or Moroccan when she spoke her native Dutch .
KL , a 7 - year - old boy , sounded like a native Frenchman to most , but Moroccan , Asian or African to others .
Neither patient had a history of brain trauma , and , in the case of KL , magnetic - resonance brain imaging showed no abnormalities .
This stands in stark contrast to most other people with FAS , who have lesions or damage in brain areas thought to be involved in speech and language .
“ If it is a neural system , as we ’re sure it is , then it ’s certainly possible that even in developmental stages [ FAS ] might emerge , ” Blumstein says .
The possibility of a developmental origin for FAS suggests that genetic mutations could be associated with the syndrome .
Mariën ’s team has begun working with a young woman with signs of FAS who says that her sister speaks similarly .
“ Can we identify , in these developmental cases , a genetic basis ? ” he wonders .

BETHESDA , Maryland ( CNN ) -- Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told government leaders at a swine flu preparedness summit Thursday that a vaccine to fight the H1N1 virus should be ready for distribution in mid-October .
HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius tells a summit Thursday that the impact of the H1N1 virus may worsen in the fall .
But Sebelius also advised 500 government , health and education leaders to plan for the worst - case scenario of the virus reappearing with renewed strength this fall .
" What we need to assume is that it will come back in a much more severe form , " she said at the conference at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda , Maryland , outside Washington .
Commonly called swine flu , the virus is also known as influenza A( H1N1 ) .
The World Health Organization declared the virus a global pandemic last month .
Sebelius said that extensive planning to combat the spread of the virus always could be scaled back later but that officials could not delay starting work on those preparations .
" We can step back from our planning .
What we can't do is wait until October , " she said .
The fight against H1N1 will be federally funded , the secretary said .
She said the government will announce $ 350 million in preparedness grants on Friday , with $ 260 million for state health departments and $ 90 million for hospitals preparing for a possible surge of patients .
President Obama requested the summit , and he spoke to the group via video link from Italy , where he is attending the Group of Eight meeting of industrialized nations .
" We want to make sure we are n't promoting panic , but we are promoting vigilance and preparation , " Obama said .
Obama urged state and local officials , including school districts , to prepare for a vaccination campaign in the fall and to anticipate that the virus could significantly affect schools .
Health care workers hope to evaluate a candidate vaccine against H1N1 in August , said Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , who also spoke at the meeting .
Sebelius said medical experts are testing virus strains , preparing the production lines and beginning clinical trials .
She said the initial target group for the vaccine will be pregnant women , children ages 5 to 17 , health care workers , the elderly and anyone with chronic health conditions such as asthma .
A new Web site has been set up for H1N1 , http://www.flu.gov/, which has information on the virus and helpful tips .
A school nurse was one of three education workers invited to talk about their experiences in the spring during the wave of swine flu cases .
Mary Pappas of St. Francis Prep High School in Fresh Meadows , New York , said she was called on to take charge when students began showing up in her office with fevers .
Pappas said that she told the kids to pull out their cell phones and call their parents to come get them .
That Thursday , she sent 102 students home ; on Friday , another 80 sick students left school .
At one point , she said , there were so many sick teens that she asked a security guard to take their temperatures , write the number on a Post - it note and attach it to their chests .
The private school was closed during the following week .
According to the New York City Health Department , at least 69 cases of the H1N1 virus were confirmed at the school , and the number likely increased after the agency stopped counting .
A health department survey showed that one - third of the students , or 659 teens , reported flulike symptoms during April .
Belinda Lee Pustka , a school superintendent in Schertz , Texas , a suburb of San Antonio , said parks and churches closed when the swine flu hit .
Parents wanted to know the impact of the virus on their family and community , said Pustka , who oversees the Schertz - Cibolo - Universal City Independent School District .
Good communication was the key , she said .
The district held daily news conferences and opened a Twitter account that some people used to ask questions during briefings .
" It was a very positive experience , but it was a very hard experience for the community , " Pustka added .
Swine flu continues to circulate in the United States and more than 120 other countries -- especially in the Southern Hemisphere , where flu season is under way .
The virus could hit the U.S. as children return to school , which is only weeks away , Sebelius told CNN earlier Thursday .
Thursday 's symposium offers an opportunity to look ahead and begin to put things in place , Sebelius said on CNN's " American Morning . "
There are more than 33,900 confirmed and probable cases of the H1N1 virus in the United States , with 170 deaths , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
More than 98,000 cases have been documented worldwide , with 440 deaths , according to the WHO .
The virus has bucked traditional flu outbreak patterns .
Influenza is typically more active during winter and then slows when the weather turns hot .
" Now , in the UK , as in many of the North American countries -- Canada , Mexico and the United States -- there has been quite widespread activity , or a lot of activity of this pandemic influenza virus .
And right now , it is at a typical point of the year where the activity should be pretty low , but the activity is quite high because it is a pandemic situation for these countries , " Keiji Fukuda , WHO assistant director - general , said this week .
Regular seasonal flu kills about 36,000 Americans annually .
Sebelius said the vaccine for seasonal flu is ready for use .

Selon Cnet et TorrentFreak , on connait enfin le business model que va adopter The Pirate Bay suite à son rachat …
Global Gaming Factory ( l’acquereur de TPB ) vient en effet d’annoncer que le plus gros site d’échange de Torrent du monde allait devenir payant …
Wooo
On s’en doutait mais je pensais qu’ils allaient attendre un peu avant d’annoncer ça de but en blanc …
Bref , on ne connait pas encore les tarifs mais d’après ce qui est expliqué par Wayne Rosso de GGF , plus vous partagerez et moins vous paierez cher … ça peut donc être effectivement intéressant .
Cela bien sûr dans le but de gagner de l’argent pour rémunérer les ayants droits .
Reste maintenant à savoir si ces fameux ayants droits joueront le jeu .
Moi je pense que ces derniers ont plutôt intérêt à se précipiter sur cette opportunité car les premiers dans la course seront les premiers à en retirer un maximum de bénéfice ( via la pub que ça leur fera ) .
Au final , on se dirige donc lentement et surement vers une licence globale …
Sauf qu’au lieu de la payer directement à l’Etat ou aux ayants droits , on la paiera à une société suédoise .
Ironique n’est ce pas ?
On le sait depuis le début que la licence globale est inévitable et ces escargots de majors ont encore loupé le coche de manière intersidérale …
Reste a voir maintenant si The Pirate Bay conservera son immense trafic , si les gens paieront et surtout si télécharger sur The Pirate Bay deviendra légal ( en France par exemple , face à un loi comme Hadopi … )
Autre petit point annoncé par GGF , la mise en place d’un protocole Bittorrent aux stéroids qui ferait économiser environ 80 % de bande passante aux FAI qui joueraient le jeu .
Affaire à suivre …

What is a Domain Name ?
The Domain is a crucial part of a website 's URL ( Uniform Resource Locator ) - the address at which any web browser in the world can access your site .
It will look a little bit like this :
The Protocol and Subdomain are largely outside your control , but the Domain ( green ) is of utmost importance as it gives your site an identity .
As you can see in the example above , webhostingsearch.com is the Domain of this website .
Choosing a Domain matching the name of the website makes it easier for people to remember and find , and gives your site a valuable sense of professionalism .
Top Level Domains ( TLD )
The most popular Top Level Domains ( TLD ) are .com and .net , therefore they are also the easiest to remember .
The TLD you choose depends on your branding and what impression you intend to give - try a few out and see which one sounds right .
As a general rule though , you can't really go wrong with a .com as it is highly recognizable and trusted by visitors and search engines alike .
However , all countries have their own country code Top Level Domain ( ccTLD ) consisting of two letters , created and delegated by the IANA ( Internet Assigned Numbers Authority ) .
It is a good idea to get a ccTLD ( even in addition to another TLD such as .com ) in order to target local visitors - for example British people have more trust in URLs ending .uk .
This will also make your website rank better in search engine results in your target country .
Did you know ?
ccTLDs are not always used in a conventional manner .
Together with the right Domain Name some can form creatively phrased URLs .
Armenia 's .am is often used for AM radio stations , Italy 's .it in domain hacks ( for phrases ending with " it " ) and Tonga 's . to for phrases ending with " to " - as well as being promoted as the TLD for Toronto .
Additionally , the range of Generic Top Level Domains ( gTLD ) available is larger than ever before , giving you the option of ending your URL with descriptive suffixes such as .news , . markets , .academy among many more .
Go direct to GoDaddy if you know you want one of these TLDs as opposed to the .com , .net and .tv TLDs offered here .
Choosing a Domain Name
The best and most memorable Domains are short , simple and unique .
Find a Domain that contains relevant keywords ( such as the name of your website or company ) , and avoids punctuation or numbers to reduce the chance of potential visitors confusing or misspelling it .

Include Your Brand or Company Name
To be successful in marketing in general , it 's critical to develop a strong brand .
Including your brand or company name in your site 's Domain will be an invaluable contribution to this aim .
Do n't forget , you always have the option to register other , more generic domains later on and redirect them to your website .
When just starting off though , stick to the brand .
Keep it Simple
Nobody enjoys typing long , complicated URLs into their web browsers - keep your Domain name as short and simple as possible without losing meaning .
Striking the right balance between simplicity and descriptiveness is the challenge here .
On a similar note , avoid using hyphens and numbers .
These may seem like a good idea if they allow you to get a variation of the Domain you want , but it will lack the memorability of a simple , well - chosen Domain name .
Include Relevant Keywords
Ideally , you will already have a list of keywords that relate to your website .
Incorporating one or two of them into your Domain name lets people know , at a glance , what they can expect to find at your website .
There are also serious potential benefits for the SEO for your site - URLs containing relevant keywords often rank much higher in search engine results .
Be Memorable and Unique
If potential visitors can't remember your URL , they may instead search for your website via a search engine .
Although not disastrous , forcing visitors to find you in this way creates the possibility that they will arrive at a competitor 's site .
Do n't try to ride on the coattails of another popular website by choosing a similar Domain name - it will do nothing except give your visitors a negative first impression .
If you are completely out of ideas , try entering some keywords ( without spaces ) into the Domain Search tool above with Keyword Based Suggestions selected from the drop - down .
This will enable you to use the search tool as a Domain Name Generator , and you can pick your favorite from there !

Buy Registered or Expired Domains
If you can't find the name you want here , it may have already been registered by someone else .
In this case , you can search on WhoIs to find the owner and get in touch about the possibility of purchasing the Domain .
However , it is not always possible to contact the Domain owner - they may have paid for private Domain registration thereby making their contact information inaccessible , or the information may be out of date .
Fortunately in these cases , there are Domain marketplace websites where registered or soon - expiring Domain Names are bought and sold , both in auctions and at fixed prices .
Domains bought at these sites are usually much more expensive than the options you will find here and at GoDaddy , so be sure you 've tried plenty of different options before going down this route .
Also , be sure to check your prospective Domain 's history so you do n't inadvertently inherit any search engine penalties .
Founded in 2000 , SnapNames are a very popular Domain registrar who list for sale over 30 million Domain Names every year .
You can set up backorders to get a headstart on the competition , or use their Domain brokerage service to secure the rarest , premium Domains .
Based in the USA , SEDO boasts over 2 million members worldwide , and provides a platform for trading Domains in over 20 languages .
They offer the tools necessary to buy , sell , and monetize domains - including Domain appraisals and brokerage services .
At the time of writing , SEDO 's database contained over 18 million Domains .
Domains FAQ
How much does a Domain cost ?
Typically , owning a Domain will cost you less than $ 10 per year .
Sometimes , this figure is even lower if the Domain is not so popular , or if there are competitive offers from Domain sellers .
Conversely , the price can also be higher in cases of highly attractive Domains .
Buying a Domain that was previously registered is often more expensive , but it all depends on the Domain Name and TLD you want .
My website is n't online yet , can I get a Domain from my hosting provider ?
Yes !
In fact many of the excellent value for money plans on our Cheap Web Hosting page bundle the cost of a Domain into their price .
This is the most convenient solution as you only need to deal with one company for both services .
One that we recommend in particular is eHost , who are currently offering free Domain registration with selected Web Hosting plans , starting at only $ 2.75 per month !
What happens if I decide I do n't want my Domain any more ?
Usually , Domain registrations will renew continuously until you specify otherwise so in this case , you will need to notify your Domain registrar .
Depending on their terms and conditions , you may need to notify them a set amount of time in advance .
Do I need to use keywords in my Domain ?
No , it is n't compulsory to have keywords in your Domain , but it helps if you are yet to establish a brand .
For example Amazon.com does n't refer to shopping in any way , but they are so well - known that it no longer matters .
It is also believed that Domains which incorporate relevant keywords rank more highly in search engine results , but even if it is the case , it is only one factor among many .
With a strong enough brand and marketing strategy , any Domain name can be successful .
How long can a Domain Name be ?
127 characters , to be precise .
You can use characters A - Z. any numbers , and hyphens ( although not at the beginning or end ) .
It is advisable however to make your Domain Name as short and simple as possible while still conveying your site 's purpose .
Should I get my Domain Name evaluated ?
A Domain Name is only worth what you do with it , so we advise no .
Just follow the basic advice given here and you will be able to choose an appropriate Domain with little trouble .

ScalaBox2D is going to get an SVG scene importer soon .
This will let you draw a scene in Inkscape and load it as a Box2D world in ScalaBox2D .
I already pushed a very basic version of this to GitHub .
It uses Slick ‘s SVG parser and has many limitations as of now , but you can already draw a Scene like this :
And bring it to life in a ScalaBox 2D application :
Currently every circle , box or polygon that has a red ( # ff0000 ) fill will be turned into a dynamic body , the rest will be static bodies .
There are also some limitations to the shapes , including : polygons must be convex , and have at most 8 vertices ( or they ’ll become static edges ) .
Ellipses / arcs are not supported , only circles .
You may get exceptions when loading some shapes .
The goal right now is to make this as robust as possible , so you can run the ScalaBox2D testbed and load ( almost ) any SVG file saved by Inkscape into it .
After that , I ’ll add support for loading scenes from game code and tying the physical bodies to game objects .
The code for the app looks like this :
import org.villane.box2d.svg._ import org.villane.box2d.draw.DrawFlags._ import org.villane.box2d.testbed.slick._ object SVGApp { val scale = 15 def main ( args : Array [ String ] ) { val loader = new SlickSVGSceneLoader ( " C:/drawing -1.svg " , scale ) val world = loader .
create val flags = Shapes SlickDisplayWorld.runWithSimulation ( world , false , flags ) } }
Guest commentary by Alan Robock – Rutgers University
Bjorn Lomborg ’s Climate Consensus Center just released an un-refereed report on geoengineering , An Analysis of Climate Engineering as a Response to Global Warming , by J Eric Bickel and Lee Lane .
The “ consensus ” in the title of Lomborg ’s center is based on a meeting of 50 economists last year .
The problem with allowing economists to decide the proper response of society to global warming is that they base their analysis only on their own quantifications of the costs and benefits of different strategies .
In this report , discussed below , they simply omit the costs of many of the potential negative aspects of producing a stratospheric cloud to block out sunlight or cloud brightening , and come to the conclusion that these strategies have a 25 - 5000 to 1 benefit / cost ratio .
That the second author works for the American Enterprise Institute , a lobbying group that has been a leading global warming denier , is not surprising , except that now they are in favor of a solution to a problem they have claimed for years does not exist .
Geoengineering has come a long way since first discussed here three years ago .
[ Here I use the term “ geoengineering ” to refer to “ solar radiation management ” ( SRM ) and not to carbon capture and sequestration ( called “ air capture ” in the report ) , a related topic with quite different issues . ]
In a New Scientist interview , John Holdren , President Obama ’s science adviser , says geoengineering has to be examined as a possible response to global warming , but that we can make no such determination now .
A two - day conference on geoengineering organized by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences was held in June , 2009 , with an opening talk by the President , Ralph Cicerone .
The American Meteorological Society ( AMS ) has just issued a policy statement on geoengineering , which urges cautious consideration , more research , and appropriate restrictions .
But all this attention comes with the message that we know little about the efficacy , costs , and problems associated with geoengineering suggestions , and that much more study is needed .
Bickel and Lane , however , do not hesitate to write a report that is rather biased in favor of geoengineering using SRM , by emphasizing the low cost and dismissing the many possible negative aspects .
They use calculations with the Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy ( DICE ) economic model to make the paper seem scientific , but there are many inherent assumptions , and they up - front refuse to present their results in terms of ranges or error bars .
Specific numbers in their conclusions make the results seem much more certain than they are .
While they give lip service to possible negative consequences of geoengineering , they refuse to quantify them .
Indeed , the purpose of new research is to do just that , but the tone of this report is to claim that cooling the planet will have overall benefits , which CAN be quantified .
The conclusions and summary of the report imply much more certainty as to the net benefits of SRM than is really the case .
My main areas of agreement with this report are that global warming is an important , serious problem , that SRM with stratospheric aerosols or cloud brightening would not be expensive , and that we indeed need more research into geoengineering .
The authors provide a balanced introduction to the issues of global warming and the possible types of geoengineering .
But Bickel and Lane ignore the effects of ocean acidification from continued CO2 emissions , dismissing this as a lost cause .
Even without global warming , reducing CO2 emissions is needed to do the best we can to save the ocean .
The costs of this continuing damage to the planet , which geoengineering will do nothing to address , are ignored in the analysis in this report .
And without mitigation , SRM would need to be continued for hundreds of years .
If it were stopped , by the loss of interest or means by society , the resulting rapid warming would be much more dangerous than the gradual warming we are now experiencing .
Bickel and Lane do not even mention several potential negative effects of SRM , including getting rid of blue skies , huge reductions in solar power from systems using direct solar radiation , or ruining terrestrial optical astronomy .
They imply that SRM technologies will work perfectly , and ignore unknown unknowns .
Not one cloud has ever been artificially brightened by injection of sea salt aerosols , yet this report claims to be able to quantify the benefits and the costs to society of cloud brightening .
They also imply that stratospheric geoengineering can be tested at a small scale , but this is not true .
Small injections of SO2 into the stratosphere would actually produce small radiative forcing , and we would not be able to separate the effects from weather noise .
The small volcanic eruptions of the past year ( 1.5 Tg SO2 from Kasatochi in 2008 and 1 Tg SO2 from Sarychev in 2009 , as compared to 7 Tg SO2 from El Chichón in 1982 and 20 Tg SO2 from Pinatubo in 1991 ) have produced stratospheric clouds that can be well - observed , but we cannot detect any climate impacts .
Only a large - scale stratospheric injection could produce measurable impacts .
This means that the path they propose would lead directly to geoengineering , even just to test it , and then it would be much harder to stop , what with commercial interests in continuing ( e.g. , Star Wars , which has not even ever worked ) .
Bickel and Lane also ignore several seminal papers on geoengineering that present much more advanced scientific results than the older papers they cite .
In particular , they ignore Tilmes et al. ( 2008 ) , Robock et al. ( 2008 ) , Rasch et al. ( 2008 ) , and Jones et al. ( 2009 ) .
With respect to ozone , they dismiss concerns about ozone depletion and enhanced UV by citing Wigley ( 2006 ) and Crutzen ( 2006 ) , but ignore the results of Tilmes et al. ( 2008 ) , who showed that the effects would prolong the ozone hole for decades and that deployment of stratospheric aerosols in a couple decades would not be safe as claimed here .
Bickel and Lane assert , completely incorrectly , “ On its face , though , it does not appear that the ozone issue would be likely to invalidate the concept of stratospheric aerosols . ”
With respect to an Arctic - only scheme , they suggest in several places that it would be possible to control Arctic climate based on the results of Caldeira and Wood ( 2008 ) who artificially reduce sunlight in a polar cap in their model ( the “ yarmulke method ” ) , whereas Robock et al. ( 2008 ) showed with a more realistic model that explicitly treats the distribution and transport of stratospheric aerosols , that the aerosols could not be confined to just the Arctic , and such a deployment strategy would affect the summer Asian monsoon , reducing precipitation over China and India .
And Robock et al. ( 2008 ) give examples from past volcanic eruptions that illustrate this effect , such as the pattern of precipitation reduction after the 1991 Pinatubo eruption ( Trenberth and Dai , 2007 ) :
With respect to cloud brightening , Bickel and Lane ignore the Jones et al. ( 2009 ) results that cloud brightening would mainly cool the oceans and not affect land temperature much , so that it is an imperfect method at best to counter global warming .
Furthermore Jones et al. ( 2009 ) found that cloud brightening over the South Atlantic would produce severe drought over the Amazon , destroying the tropical forest .
They also ignore a huge class of ethical and world governance issues .
Whose hand would be on the global thermostat ?
Who would trust military aircraft or a multi-national geoengineering company to have the interests of the people of the planet foremost ?
They do not seem to realize that volcanic eruptions affect climate change because of sulfate aerosols produced from sulfur dioxide gas injections into the stratosphere , the same that is proposed for SRM , and not by larger ash particles that fall out quickly after and eruption and do not cause climate change .
They dismiss air capture ( “ air capture technologies do not appear as promising as solar radiation management from a technical or a cost perspective ” ) but ignore the important point that it would have few of the potential side effects of SRM .
Air capture would just remove the cause of global warming in the first place , and the only side effects would be in the locations where the CO2 would be sequestered .
For some reason , they insist on using the wrong units for energy flux ( W ) instead of the correct units of W / m^2 , and then mix them in the paper .
I cannot understand why they choose to make it so confusing .
The potential negative consequences of stratospheric SRM were clearly laid out by Robock ( 2008 ) and updated by Robock et al. ( 2009 ) , which still lists 17 reasons why geoengineering may be a bad idea .
One of those important possible consequences , the threat to the water supply for agriculture and other human uses , has been emphasized in a recent Science article by Gabi Hegerl and Susan Solomon .
Robock et al. ( 2009 ) also lists some benefits from SRM , including increased plant productivity and an enhanced CO2 sink from vegetation that grows more when subject to diffuse radiation , as has been observed after every recent large volcanic eruption .
But the quantification of these and other geoengineering benefits , as well as the negative aspects , awaits more research .
It may be that the benefits of geoengineering will outweigh the negative aspects , and that most of the problems can be dealt with , but the paper from Lomborg ’s center ignores the real consensus among all responsible geoengineering researchers .
The real consensus , as expressed at the National Academy conference and in the AMS statement , is that mitigation needs to be our first and overwhelming response to global warming , and that whether geoengineering can even be considered as an emergency measure in the future should climate change become too dangerous is not now known .
Policymakers will only be able to make such decisions after they see results from an intensive research program .
Lomborg ’s report should have stopped at the need for a research program , and not issued its flawed and premature conclusions .

A picture essay in The Times Magazine on Sunday and an expanded slide show on NYTimes.com entitled " Ruins of the Second Gilded Age " showed large housing construction projects across the United States that came to a halt , often half - finished , when the housing market collapsed .
The introduction said that the photographer , a freelancer based in Bedford , England , " creates his images with long exposures but without digital manipulation . "
A reader , however , discovered on close examination that one of the pictures was digitally altered , apparently for aesthetic reasons .
Editors later confronted the photographer and determined that most of the images did not wholly reflect the reality they purported to show .
Had the editors known that the photographs had been digitally manipulated , they would not have published the picture essay , which has been removed from NYTimes.com .

CNN -- Ben Steele hated the young man as soon as he saw him .
Ben Steele at a Japanese coal mine prison camp in 1944 .
The man 's almond - shaped eyes , dark hair and olive skin -- Steele had seen those Asian facial features before .
He saw that face when he watched Japanese soldiers behead sick men begging for water , run over stumbling prisoners with tanks and split his comrades ' skulls with rifle butts .
" Men died like flies , " Steele says .
" I thought for a while I would never make it . "
Steele , now 91 , is one of the last survivors of the Bataan Death March .
During World War II , the Japanese army forced American and Filipino prisoners of war on a march so horrific that the Japanese commander was later executed for war crimes .
Steele returned home to Montana after the war to teach , but he still had something to learn .
When he saw a young Japanese - American student seated in his class one day , he felt both anger and anguish .
What , he wondered , do I do with all of the hate I 've brought home with me ?
' The worst war story ' he ever heard
Steele 's answer to that question can be found in the new book " Tears in the Darkness , " a searing depiction of the Bataan Death March .
The book details how Steele found help through an unlikely source .
But he would first have to survive one of the worst defeats in U.S. military history .
In December 1941 , Japanese forces attacked an army of American and Filipino soldiers in the Philippine Islands and forced them to surrender .
They captured 76,000 prisoners , double what they had expected .
The Japanese forced the POWs to march 66 miles under a tropical sun to a railway station for transport .
They shot , bayoneted and beat to death prisoners who could n't keep pace .
At least 7,000 soldiers died during the march .
More died later .
The brutal conditions of the march contributed to the subsequent deaths of an estimated 25,000 Filipinos and 1500 Americans in Japanese prison camps , says Michael Norman , a Vietnam veteran who wrote " Tears in the Darkness , " with his wife , Elizabeth .
" It 's the worst war story I 've ever heard , " Norman says .
" What they [ the Japanese ] did was monstrous . "
Prisoners were forced to bury others alive and work as slave laborers ; some were executed for sport .
One Japanese soldier , who later became a Buddhist priest , told the authors that he is still haunted by what he did on Bataan .
Some Filipinos who live today near the march 's route say that they , too , cannot forget what happened , Elizabeth Norman says .
" They would tell us that when they lay awake at night , they thought they could still hear the trampling of the men's feet on the death march , " she says .
Why Steele survived
The death march was filled with villains , but the authors also found a hero : Steele .
The march is told through his eyes and drawings .
Steele was a cowboy from Montana who could ride a horse , rope cattle and shoot by the time he was 8 years old .
" I thought that if anybody gets out of here , I 'm going to be one of them , " says Steele , who was a 22 - year - old Army Air Corps private when he was captured .
At times , though , Steele wondered whether he was being too optimistic .
He was bayoneted , starved and beaten .
He was constantly ill , and his weight fell to 112 pounds .
Steele found a way to preserve his mind even as his body wasted away :
He drew .
He started sketching pictures of what he saw during his captivity .
" I felt an obligation to show people what went on there , " he says .
Steele was released after three years of captivity when World War II ended .
He returned to Billings , Montana , where he became an art professor at a state college .
" I had a lot of anger when I got home , " Steele says .
" We were beaten for so long .
I hated [ the Japanese ] . "
Steele meets his ' nemesis '
Steele 's hatred smoldered for 15 years .
It threatened to spill out into the open in 1960 , when he walked into his classroom on the first day of the semester and saw a Japanese - American student .
In " Tears in the Darkness , " Steele says that his " heart hardened and filled with hate . "
But he was so anguished by what he was feeling , he returned to his office after class to think .
He told himself that the war was over ; he was n't a prisoner anymore , and he had to treat the Japanese - American student like anybody else , because he was an American , too .
Then he did something else .
He invited the student to his office for a talk .
The student 's name was Harry Koyama , and he , too , had been marked by the war .
His family had been imprisoned at a " relocation camp " in Arizona during the war .
Steele also discovered that he and Koyama had something else in common : a passion for drawing Montana 's rural life .
By the end of the semester , Koyama was one of Steele 's best students .
Steele says that talking to Koyama helped his hatred evaporate .
" We had a discussion and finally came to an understanding that we liked each other , " he says .
Today , Steele and Koyama remain in touch .
" We 're the best of friends , " Koyama tells CNN from his Montana art studio .
" We see each other regularly . "
Koyama says he can't remember exactly what he and Steele talked about first , only that Steele had always treated him well .
Steele did tell him later that their relationship helped him recover from the war , he says .
" I was just there , " Koyama says .
" I just happened to be there for him to use my presence as a way to overcome his dark time . "
Koyama says he is still amazed by Steele 's survival story .
" Just to be a part of his life is an honor , " Koyama says .
Steele 's voice is still strong and his mind sharp .
He 's been married to his wife , Shirley , for 57 years , and they have three children and six grandchildren .
Steele says Bataan taught him to treasure small pleasures , like a drink of cool water and a warm bed at night .
" I'm thankful that I have a plateful of food , " he says .
" I can remember when that plate was empty . "
He still remembers tiny details from the death march as well .
He constantly draws pictures of his friends and tormentors on Bataan .
Their faces fill his sketchbooks .
Steele 's hate may be gone , but the death march lingers .
" I think about it every day , " he says .
" It 's in my mind , and I 'll never get it out . "
All About World War II • Montana • Vietnam
ANALYSIS / OPINION :
The United States is functionally bankrupt .
Our collective capacity to deal with this astonishing fact is seemingly nonexistent .
Our national politics have become show business , exhibiting a complete refusal to strategically respond to this reality .
Let ’s look at the simple numbers of our national debt .
Our on - the - books national debt is $ 11.6 trillion .
But off - the - books federal debt , including Medicare and Social Security , is $ 107 trillion .
This is not a made - up number ; this is the money we should have in the bank , according to the federal government ’s own accountants , to pay for our current promises to our retirees and future retirees , and this does n’t include unfunded obligations that we have to the pensions and benefits promised to federal workers and veterans .
Nor does it include huge unfunded pension and benefit obligations for other public employees at levels below the federal government .
But let ’s just add the $ 11 trillion to the $ 107 trillion , and we get $ 118 trillion .
These are big numbers but still just fifth - grade math .
Now our total annual national output , or gross domestic product ( GDP ) , is about $ 14.3 trillion .
Total federal receipts , or income if stated in business terms , are about $ 2.5 trillion .
This means that our debt to federal income ratio is about 47 , and that ratio assumes that the federal revenues are free to retire the obligations , which they are not .
We must pay for defense and a myriad of other programs .
Again , in business terms , there is no free cash flow to pay these massive obligations .
Our total national private net worth , according to the Federal Reserve Board , is about $ 51.5 trillion .
That means our federal unfunded liabilities represent 2.3 times our collective net worth .
That ’s pretty darn broke .
Ask any accountant , banker , or anyone remotely familiar with simple accounting knowledge if we can service this debt , and the collective answer is a resounding “ no . ”
Any business with these ratios would be a complete basket case , hopelessly bankrupt .
Unlike General Motors Corp. , there is no one with the wherewithal to bail out the U.S.A .
If anyone can write an intelligent response to how we can handle this massive problem , please respond .
I would love to see the plan .
I once asked one of my federal senators , Sen .
Tom Harkin , Iowa Democrat , how we would handle this nightmare , and he simply replied , “ We ’ll grow our way out of this . ”
Senator , I challenge you to lay out this cheery scenario .
We are not politically set up to grow at 8 percent or 9 percent like China .
We would have to adopt extremely aggressive pro-growth policies , and those are not politically acceptable at this time .
Even if we significantly slash the federal entitlements by half , we cannot fix this problem .
Even if we increase federal receipts from the 50 year average of 18 1/2 percent of GDP to say 27 percent , killing private - sector growth , we cannot fix the problem .
We are collectively broke .
It is a horrible legacy we are leaving to our children .
Can common sense be restored ?

From TPM Reader EK …
I live with my wife and son just outside of London .
When our son Leo was due to be born , like virtually every family in the UK ( rich or poor ) , we went to our local NHS hospital for the delivery .
An unpredictable chain of events resulted in unforeseeable complications during his birth .
Leo was born in very poor health and was immediately transferred to a SCBU ( Special Care Birth Unit ) in another hospital .
Because of the severity of Leo ’s condition we were transferred to the most advanced SCBU in the region .
I am an middle aged , white male American who lives in the UK working for a medium sized US company .
The following is a true story about my many years experience of the NHS ( National Health Service ) in the UK , only the names have been changed to protect the identity of my family .
Leo spent the next three weeks in the SCBU being cared for 24/7 by highly trained nursing staff using the latest technology and a team was formed with about a dozen specialists from around the country working together to ensure Leo ’s many complex problems were dealt with using the best medical knowledge available .
As parents we stayed with Leo in the parents residence just down the hall from the SCBU .
Our room was basic , but it had cable TV and we got clean bedding and towels as well as three meals a day for three weeks .
How much did all of this cost ?
I will never know because as a UK resident and taxpayer it was provided as a public service .
By the time Leo was three months old it was obvious he was experiencing many very difficult problems .
Leo was referred to one of the top specialists in Europe , a professor consultant in neonatal neurology .
The professor determined Leo needed a MRI scan , but because of Leo ’s small size and constant abnormal movement , no existing scanner could safely be used .
It was decided the newest and fastest scanner in the country would be modified to accommodate Leo ’s situation .
When we arrived for the scan we were greeted not only by the professor and her team but by a team of technicians and scientists from the manufacturer .
The MRI magnets were partially dismantled and recalibrated and a frame for Leo was built on the spot so he could safely undergo the scanning procedure .
How much did all of this cost ?
I will never know because as a UK resident and taxpayer it was provided as a public service .
The scan showed that Leo had received a profound brain injury before birth .
He had many different tests to determine the extent of his disabilities including EEG , X - ray , video fluoroscopy , endoscopy , sight tests , hearing tests , and others .
Leo was referred to eight different specialists to deal with his problems and underwent surgery to implant a portal in his stomach so he can be fed directly by tube , without danger of food being “ swallowed ” into his lungs .
Leo ’s dietary requirements are very special and all food , as well as the daily feeding kits and the pump needed to deliver the feed are provided by the NHS .
Leo is on about a dozen different medications and all meds , syringes and other daily disposable equipment are provided by the NHS .
Leo has a wheelchair , sitting frame , standing frame , sleep system , leg and hand splints and other equipment , all designed for him and all replaced or adjusted every few months because he is a growing boy .
All equipment as well as the technicians who maintain the equipment are provided by the NHS .
How much does all of this cost ?
I will never know because as a UK resident and taxpayer it was provided as a public service .
Is the NHS perfect ?
Far from it !
Can it be more bureaucratic and slower than I would like at times ?
Of course !
Has there ever been an issue about Leo not receiving care because he is profoundly disabled ?
Never !
Have we ever had to stand before a “ Death Panel ” and justify the vast ongoing expense of Leo ’s care , even though he will never be a productive member of society ?
NO !
When surveys ask people what is the single thing they are proudest about the UK , the winner is The National Health Service .
I can't imagine what it 's like to be a booth babe , especially not at a show like Comic Con .
You 're being pawed at by huge amounts of sweaty geeks , you have to smile and be pleasant to people who may or may not have showered ... it always seems like a hellish existence .
What does n't help ?
Having your employer offer a bounty if people sexually harass you .
At Comic Con , if you commit " an act of lust " with an EA booth babe and take a picture , you could win dinner with said babes , as well as a great big pile of prizes related to the upcoming Dante 's Inferno .
That 's right , the babes wo n't just get the standard behavior and awkward advances — if someone is really obnoxious , they get rewarded for it , and then you get to see them again socially !
Technically you 're only supposed to take a picture to be entered , but I can't even start to imagine how people are going to get creative with this one .
I hope they gave their models a can of mace or , better yet , an actual mace .
Or maybe just a few sharpened sticks .
Going into that throng , in a thong , with prizes being awarded for lustful actions being enacted upon you ?
Dear Lord .
This may fit in with the theme of the game , but those poor , poor women .

Instructable user arcticpenguin unraveled the mystery behind various screw types ( what ?
You think that there are only Phillips and slotted screws ? ) .
Take for example , the history of the Phillips screw :
This cross drive screw story starts when Henry Phillips purchased a crude form of a cruciform - recessed screw head concept from an Oregon inventor named J.P. Thompson .
Henry F. Phillips ( 1890 to 1958 ) , a U.S. businessman from Portland , Oregon , has the honor of having the Phillips head screw and screwdriver named after him .
The cruciform shape can be considered to be a cruciform design with their 90 degree shapes as most have similar physics properties .
Phillips developed Thompsons invention screw into a workable form .
Phillips had come up with a recessed cross screw designed for efficiency on an auto assembly line .
The idea was that the screwdriver would turn the screw with increasing force until the tip of the driver popped out , called camout .
When tightening a Phillips screw with a Phillips screw driver you will notice that when the torque gets to be too strong , the screw driver winds itself out of the screw so the screw head would not be ruined or brake off .
Phillips also founded the Phillips Screw Company in Oregon in 1933 , but never actually made screws .
He had called on every established screw manufacturer in the US and was told simply that the screw could not be made .
Screw makers of the 1930s dismissed the Phillips concept since it calls for a relatively complex recessed socket shape in the head of the screw ; as distinct from the simple milled slot of a slotted type screw .
Phillips then called on the American Screw Company , a newcomer to the industry whose new president , Eugene Clark , personally became interested in the new product , despite the opposition of his engineers , who like others in the industry had insisted it could not be made .
According to one printed report , the president of American Screw Company said : " I finally told my head men that I would put on pension all who insisted it could not be done .
After that an efficient method was evolved to manufacture the fasteners and now we have licensed all other major companies to use it . "

It was a very generous deal in many ways , but it did have its drawbacks .
First , there was a strict curfew , so unless you were out with Hef , you had to be back in the hutch by 9 pm .
Second , while you could order any food or drink you wanted , at any time , from one of the many Mansion “ butlers ” , you were not allowed into the kitchen , even for a glass of water .
And third , of course , you had to live in the extraordinarily dingy Playboy mansion , where all the furniture was falling apart , the mattresses were stained and the carpets were covered in dog poo .
I remember visiting it in the early Nineties and being struck by its shabbiness then , and evidently it was the same or worse when Izabella moved in .
Part of the trouble might be that Hef does not actually own the mansion ; he has to rent it , room by room , from Playboy Enterprises and , according to Izabella , pays $ 25,000 a month for his own bedroom .

The pure electric car manufacturer has already delivered $ 100,000 Roadsters , which are fun to drive , but get into accidents easily .
( I saw one myself last week . )
Even Governor Schwarzenegger wants to return his , but only because he 's slightly too big to fit .
The S , on the other hand , can be quite an interesting step in electric car design and manufacturing of Tesla actually manages to deliver enough of them to service more than just a niche market .

By the way , the price is only $ 50,000 once you factor in the $ 7500 in tax credit .
It actually starts at a base price of $ 57,400 .

Is the gold market being manipulated by a central - bank cartel ...?
The GOLD ANTI - TRUST ACTION COMMITTEE ( GATA ) is a nonprofit advocacy and education group dedicated to exposing and opposing what it believes to be manipulation in gold , precious metals and other financial markets .
Here Hard Assets
Investor speaks with GATA chairman and director , Bill Murphy – who before he helped found GATA , worked as a commodities broker on Wall Street , and in 1998 launched the popular gold market website , Le Metropole .
HAI : GATA argues that for over a decade , Gold Prices have been kept artificially low .
Who 's behind the manipulation , and why ?
Bill Murphy :
It 's what we call " The Gold Cartel " .
The United States government is the main culprit , with " hit men " like Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan Chase , and other central banks , like the Bank of England .
It 's been going on for some time now .
Basically , it all started with [ former US Treasury Secretary under the Clinton Administration ]
Robert Rubin , back when he was the head of Goldman Sachs in London .
He would borrow gold from the central banks at a 1 % interest rate , and then sell it .
He took this idea and made it the essence of his " Strong Dollar Policy " [ while at the US Treasury ] .
Then there was Lawrence Summers , who followed him as Treasury Secretary .
He once articulated the relationship between gold and interest rates in his paper , " Gibson 's Paradox and the Gold Standard " .
Keep the Gold Price down , he said , and you keep interest rates down .
Now , the US is very concerned about stock market interest rates , the Dollar and so on .
The main way to control all that is to keep the Gold Price down .
So they 'd borrow central bank gold and surreptitiously put it in the marketplace , via various leasing and swap operations .
It 's this gold that has kept the price from being $ 2,000 an ounce – or well over it .
HAI : And the banks , why are they involved ?
Murphy : Well , it 's a very close relationship between Goldman Sachs and the US Treasury .
Half the Treasury is staffed by Goldman Sachs people .
And the Federal Reserve , well J.P. Morgan is the Federal Reserve 's bank .
They 've worked closely together , sharing information , certainly helping in trading .
Being able to borrow gold means it 's like free money when you lease it in the marketplace , as long as the price stays the same or does n't go up too much .
So they 've made money trading this market against the specs , with the government 's help , for well over a decade .
And they made a lot of money doing it .
But now they 're running out of central bank gold to meet the heavy demand showing up from everywhere .
It 's reported that the central banks have 30,000 tons of gold in their vaults .
Three of our consultants have shown through different methodologies that they have a good bit less than 15,000 tons , which is less than half of what they say they have .
The difference is the gold that 's been used over the past decade in the gold price suppression scheme .
So it 's become a very risky deal .
HAI : How so ?
Murphy :
Think of it simplistically .
If gold were to shoot up $ 250 in the next few weeks , what would everyone talk about ?
They 'd talk about too much inflation , the Dollar falling apart ; they might talk about a crisis .
It would be all negative for the politicians in power , the banks and Wall Street .
Gold is a barometer of US financial market health , which is why they try to control it .
HAI : Can you walk me through how such a price manipulation would work ?
You said banks let out gold " surreptitiously " – how do they do it without attracting notice ?
Murphy : Basically what happens is J.P. Morgan goes to a central bank and borrows gold , leases it at , say , a 1 % interest rate .
Then they take the physical gold and they dump it into the marketplace , which adds to the supply .
That supply helps to meet demand ; without that supply , demand would overpower the dwindling stuff coming out of mines and scrap supply .
Gold has gone up nine years in a row .
It 's way up this year .
Now they 're in what we call a " managed retreat , " because they can only stop the excitement so much , and they 're just trying to manage it .
They do n't want it to get out of control .
But it 's coming , and it 's so strong that they 're in deep , deep trouble .
HAI : What evidence is there suggesting price manipulation ?
Murphy :
Well , we have nothing but evidence that we 've collected for 10 years .
We have n't found anything in 10 years that shows us we were wrong , and we 're always looking .
A lot of it is on the public record , such as Alan Greenspan saying " Central banks stand ready to lease gold in increasing quantities should the price go up . "
Well , that 's what they did .
HAI : Right , but rather than what officials have said or not said , is there any evidence in the market itself that you could point to and say , " That means manipulation ? "
Murphy : Look at the concentrated position of J.P. Morgan Chase in the gold and silver markets .
Their percentage of the shorts – theirs and HSBC's – are almost the entire short position in the silver market .
That 's far more of a concentrated position than you see in oil , corn or any other commodity .
Nothing else shows anything like it .
In fact , J.P. Morgan is short more silver than Nelson Bunker Hunt was long .
[ Bunker Hunt famously cornered the silver market in early 1980 , driving the price from $ 11 to $ 50 an ounce . ]
But they allow that to occur .
It 's just ridiculous .
They 're not supposed to be having such concentrated positions .
That 's one of the mandates of the CFTC [ Commodity Futures Trading Commission ] , to make sure these things do n't occur , because that 's how manipulations can happen .
HAI : Is the fact that two or three banks have a majority in these short positions necessarily indicative of manipulation ?
Murphy :
They told Nelson Bunker
Hunt that his concentrated long position was not to be allowed , and they forced him out .
Well , why do they allow J.P. Morgan to do the same thing on the short side ?
They said that Bunker Hunt manipulated the silver market .
We 're saying that J.P. Morgan is part of the manipulation of the gold and silver market .
This all developed from Robert Rubin to Lawrence Summers , from the Clinton administration to the Bush administration and now Obama – who , by the way , is going through with the same policies .
When Geithner as Treasury Secretary was the head of the Fed [ Federal Reserve Bank of New York ] , he carried out the manipulation of the gold market .
The guy who helped originate it , Lawrence Summers , is now the top economic guy for President Obama .
It 's very entrenched .
But the difference is now they 're running out of available central bank gold to carry it out .
HAI : How do you know ?
Murphy :
At the GATA African Gold Summit , in May 2001 , Frank Veneroso , who is a consultant of ours , delivered a brilliant presentation that said they would run out of gold in 7 to 10 years , based on his work .
Well , that 's about where we are .
In addition , European central banks can sell 9.7 tonnes of gold per week as part of the Washington Agreement .
But they 're not even selling 1 tonne .
So we believe demand is 1,000 to 1,200 times greater than mined and scrap supply .
That deficit was being met by the Gold Cartel 's surreptitious selling of central bank gold .
But now instead of getting 500 tons from the European central banks to help , their supply is drying up .
They do n't want to sell anymore .
HAI : A few weeks ago , Brad Zigler of Hard Assets Investor wrote an article pointing out that banks have lopsided positions in all sorts of commodities contracts , and that large concentrations of short positions by banks are not necessarily an indication of manipulation .
Do you want to comment on that ?
Murphy : I totally disagree with that .
As far as I know , there 's nothing like it , in the sense of what J.P. Morgan and HSBC have in the silver market specifically .
That concentration is far greater than any other position a bank or any other firm has .
It 's very abnormal to have this size of concentration for the open interest .
HAI : What about platinum and palladium ?
In those markets , the banks only have short positions , right ?
Murphy :
That 's basically what they have in the silver market also .
But you 're talking many banks , versus just one or two .
Now if there were 10 , 15 , 20 firms with these positions , good for them .
But in silver 's case , it 's just J.P. Morgan and HSBC .
Their short position stands out far more than anyone else's .
HAI : Assuming the price of gold has been kept artificially low , how much has the price been altered as a result ?
You threw out $ 2,000 earlier – where did that figure come from ?
Murphy :
This is a pretty commonly used number , even in the mainstream world .
Had the Gold Price kept pace with US inflation , it would be $ 2,300 per ounce , let 's say between $ 2,000 - $ 2,400 an ounce .
Back when we had our Gold Rush 21 Conference [ in 2005 ] , the price was $ 436 , and I said it was going to take $ 3,000 - 5,000 an ounce price to clear the market .
And I think that 's the kind of price you 're going to see in the years ahead .
Once it takes out $ 1,000 , gold 's just going to take off like you wo n't believe .
HAI : But what about manipulation ?
Wo n't that keep the price down ?
Murphy :
They 'll lose control .
That does n't mean they wo n't do whatever they can to calm things down again , with whatever gold they have left .
But that 's the problem :
They keep letting loose the gold they have left .
Nobody knows how much US gold is left [ in the US Gold Reserve ] .
We 're trying to find out through the Freedom of Information Act , and the Fed and Treasury wo n't tell us .
They keep redacting or holding back information .
Now if gold 's just sitting there , and they 've never done anything with it as they say , then what 's there to hold back ?
HAI : Well , it could just be an issue of bureaucracy .
Or stupidity .
Murphy :
Well , why hold back 400 pages of documents where nothing 's going on ?
President Obama has called for transparency in our government .
Well , we 're asking for transparency .
There has n't been an official , independent audit of our gold reserves since the Eisenhower administration in 1955 ; can you imagine owning something since 1955 with no audit ?
HAI : Certainly , many things about all this appear strange .
But just because something looks suspicious does n't necessarily make it proof that manipulation is going on .
Murphy :
Well , it 's like a jury listening to a murder trial .
As you sit there , I could probably come up with 250 things that all fit together .
At the end of the trial , you 'd say some of it's circumstantial to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt .
But there 's just so much of it .
People have said they 're going to [ manipulate ] .
Here 's an exact quote from the Bank of International Settlements : " There are five main purposes of central bank cooperation , and one of them is the provision of international credits and joint efforts to influence asset prices ( especially gold and foreign exchange ) in circumstances where this might be thought useful . "
Or this : the Reserve Bank of Australia said , " foreign currency reserve assets and gold are held primarily to support intervention in the foreign exchange market . "
This is all on record .
I do n't even know why there 's a debate about this .
HAI : If it 's true that the Fed is instrumental in this price manipulation , then how do you reconcile quantitative easing ?
One of the side effects of that is that Gold Prices are just going to shoot up , right ?
Murphy :
That 's a very good question .
Because that 's where they 're in trouble .
They 're doing everything they can to keep the price of gold from going sky - high , and they 're desperately trying to keep interest rates and Treasury bonds down , and with all this money they 're printing , they 're petrified .
So it 's actually making them more aggressive in trying to keep the prices of gold and silver down .
But it 's such an obvious thing for people to see that demand is exploding all over the world .
Whether it's with Gold ETFs , the Chinese , or big hedge fund managers , the big money is pouring in , buying up the physical gold and silver .
So they , I think , are on their last legs to try and hold the prices down , because if they do n't keep interest rates down , the troubled real estate market 's going to go right back in the tank .
The quantitative easing will be the final straw that breaks the camel 's back .
But they should n't have done this in the first place .
That 's what caused the problem .
Had they not rigged the gold prices for the past 10 or 12 years , interest rates would 've gone way up , and it would 've had self - correcting mechanisms .
This is hurting a lot of people , and yet they keep doing the same thing .
But they 're going to get beat .
Military robots were once again in the news this month with headlines like " Corpse - eating robot " ( Wired ) , " Robot … to eat all life on Earth " ( The Register ) , and " Sniper Bot Refuels by consuming human bodies " ( OhGizmo ! ) .
Such death - dealing robotic zombies would certainly seem to make the Governator - style T - 800 Terminators seem like tame puppies .
A subsequent press release from the manufacturers , Cyclone Power Technologies and Robotic Technology Inc ( RTI ) , set the record straight –- these robots will be strictly vegetarian .
Cyclone announced that it had completed the first stage of development for a beta biomass engine system used to power RTI ’s Energetically Autonomous Tactical Robot ( EATR™ ) –- a most unfortunate choice of name for a grass eater .
The press release goes on to point out that , “ Desecration of the dead is a war crime under Article 15 of the Geneva Conventions , and is certainly not something sanctioned by DARPA , Cyclone or RTI . ”
But how are these autonomous robots to know the difference between battlefield dead and “ twigs , grass clippings and wood chips ? ”
Ronald C. Arkin , director of the Mobile Robot Laboratory at Georgia Tech , may have the answer .
He is designing ethical guidance software for battlefield robots under contract with the U.S. Army .
“ My research hypothesis is that intelligent robots can behave more ethically in the battlefield than humans currently can , ” says Dr. Arkin .
“ That ’s the case I make . ”
Analogous to missile guidance systems that need the use of radar and a radio or a wired link between the control point and the missile , Arkin ’s “ ethical controller ” is a software architecture that provides , “ ethical control and a reasoning system potentially suitable for constraining lethal actions in an autonomous robotic system so that they fall within the bounds prescribed by the Geneva Conventions , the Laws of War , and the Rules of Engagement . ”
Rather than guiding a missile to its intended target , Arkin ’s robotic guidance system is being designed to reduce the need for humans in harm ’s way , " … appropriately designed military robots will be better able to avoid civilian casualties than existing human war fighters and might therefore make future wars more ethical . "
Here ’s a video of what such a future might look like :
As reported in a recent New York Times article , Dr. Arkin describes some of the potential benefits of autonomous fighting robots .
They can be designed without a sense of self - preservation and , as a result , “ no tendency to lash out in fear . ”
They can be built without anger or recklessness and they can be made invulnerable to what he calls “ the psychological problem of ‘ scenario fulfillment , ’ ” that causes people to absorb new information more easily if it matches their pre-existing ideas .
The SF writer Isaac Asimov first introduced the notion of ethical rules for robots in his 1942 short story " Runaround . ”
His famous Three Laws of Robotics state the following :
A robot may not injure a human being or , through inaction , allow a human being to come to harm .
A robot must obey any orders given to it by human beings , except where such orders would conflict with the First Law .
A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law .
The Laws of War ( LOW ) and Rules of Engagement ( ROE ) make programming robots to adhere to Asimov ’s Laws far from simple .
You want the robots to protect the friendly and “ neutralize ” enemy combatants .
This likely means harming human beings on the battlefield .
In his recent book , Governing Lethal Behavior in Autonomous Robots , Dr. Arkin explores a number of complex real - world scenarios where robots with ethical governors would “ do the right thing ” –- in consultation with humans on the battlefield .
These scenarios include ROE and LOW adherence ( Taliban and Iraq ) , discrimination ( Korean DMZ ) , and proportionality and tactics ( urban sniper ) .
Arkin’s “ rules ” end up altering Asimov ’s rules to look more like these :
Engage and neutralize targets as combatants according to the ROE .
Return fire with fire proportionately .
Minimize collateral damage — intentionally minimize harm to noncombatants .
If uncertain , invoke tactical maneuvers to reassess combatant status .
Recognize surrender and hold POW until captured by human forces .
Dr. Arkin and his colleagues at Georgia Tech have developed a “ proof - of - concept ” prototype ethical governor .
His software architecture is likely years away from use on the battlefield .
h+ : Some researchers assert that no robots or AI systems will be able to discriminate between a combatant and an innocent , that this sensing ability currently just does not exist .
Do you think this is just a short - term technology limitation ?
What such technological assumptions do you make in the design of your ethical governor ?
RA : I agree this discrimination technology does not effectively exist today , nor is it intended that these systems should be fielded in current conflicts .
These are for the so - called war after next , and the DoD would need to conduct extensive additional research in order to develop the accompanying technology to support the proof - of - concept work I have developed .
But I do n’t believe there is any fundamental scientific limitation to achieving the goal of these machines being able to discriminate better than humans can in the fog of war , again in tightly specified situations .
This is the benchmark that I use , rather than perfection .
But if that standard is achieved , it can succeed in reducing noncombatant casualties and thus is a goal worth pursuing in my estimation .
h+ : How does the process of introducing moral robots onto the battlefield get bootstrapped and field tested to avoid serious and potentially lethal " glitches " in the initial versions of the ethical governor ?
What safeguards should be in place to prevent accidental war ?
RA : Verification and validation of software and systems is an integral part of any new battlefield system .
It certainly must be adhered to for moral robots as well .
What exactly the metrics are and how they can be measured for ethical interactions during the course of battle is no doubt challenging , but one I feel can be met if properly studied .
It likely would involve the military ’s battle labs , field experiments , and force - on - force exercises to evaluate the effectiveness of the ethical constraints on these systems prior to their deployment , which is fairly standard practice .
The goal is not to erode mission effectiveness , while reducing collateral damage .
A harder problem is managing the changes and tactics that an intelligent adaptive enemy would use in response to the development of these systems … to avoid spoofing and ruses that could take advantage of these ethical restraints in a range of situations .
This can be minimized , I believe , by the use of bounded morality –- limiting their deployment to narrow , tightly prescribed situations , and not for the full spectrum of combat .
h+ :
Do you envision robots ever disobeying military orders on the battlefield to " do the right thing ? "
If so , under what circumstances ?
RA : Asimov originated the use of ethical restraint in robots many years ago and presented all the quandaries that it can generate .
In our prototype ethical governor ( and in the design itself ) we do provide the robot with the right to refuse an order it deems unethical .
It must provide some explanation as to why it has refused such an order .
With some reluctance , we have engineered a human override capability into the system , but one which forces the operator to explicitly assume responsibility for any ethical infractions that might result as a consequence of such an override .
h+ :
What do you see as the implications for policy proliferation , verification and enforcement of an arms control strategy involving robotic combatants ?
Do you think increased use of robotics in the battlefield will start a new arms race ?
We do provide the robot with the right to refuse an order it deems unethical .
RA : Proliferation is a real possibility , as much of the technology at the entry levels is quite inexpensive ( for example , Radio Shack / hobby shop technology ) .
Hezbollah used armed drones in the Israeli - Lebanon conflict not long ago ( unsuccessfully ) .
But the unmanned systems are not weapons of mass destruction , and are more tactical rather than strategic .
So from my point of view , the dangers posed are not unlike those for any new battlefield advantage , whether it be gunpowder , the crossbow , or other similar inventions over the centuries .
Nonetheless
I think it is essential that international discussions should be held regarding what is acceptable / unacceptable regarding the use of armed unmanned systems in an early stage in their development ( that is … now ) .
h+:
Do you ever foresee a scenario where both sides in a conflict are strictly robotic ?
RA : Not really .
I view these unmanned systems as highly specialized assets that will be working alongside our troops , not directly replacing them .
They will conduct specialized operations ( for example , building clearing , counter sniper operations , and so forth ) that will provide an asymmetric advantage to our war fighters .
A human presence on the battlefield will be maintained , and some would argue that it must be so for a range of reasons .
h+: How quickly do you expect the rollout of robots with ethical governors ?
RA : I ’m not sure if there will ever be a rollout … we have just developed a proof - of - concept , and significant additional research by many other groups will be needed to work out problems of which we have just scratched the surface .
I often said these are just baby steps towards the goal of unmanned systems being able to outperform human soldiers from an ethical standpoint , and not simply from the metric of a body count .
But if this goal is pursued , it is possible that within one to two decades some aspects of this research may bear fruit in the battlefield .
Ronald C. Arkin received a B.S. Degree from the University of Michigan , an M.S. Degree from Stevens Institute of Technology , and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts , Amherst in 1987 .
He then assumed the position of Assistant Professor in the College of Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology where he now holds the rank of Regents ’ Professor and is the Director of the Mobile Robot Laboratory .
He also serves as the Associate Dean for Research in the College of Computing at Georgia Tech since October 2008 .
Mind maps are a great tool for creative people , in that they are a very quick , natural way for us to get whatever is in our head out of there and on paper where we can see it .
But I ’ve recently learned of a powerful way to increase the value of my mind maps : I use them to address how I feel .
The typical way that we do mind maps is based on topics .
One topic relates to other , which relates to another , and so on .
( For a good primer on how to do mind maps , check out Buzan ’s How to Mind Map . )
All this cognitive mapping is fine and good when you ’re not cognitively clear about the project , but the truth of the matter is that motivation has more to do with emotions than it does with thoughts ( and cognitive stuff ) .
Deep down , how you feel about something weighs more heavily than what you think about something .
Where Does This Stuff Come From ?
On one particularly melancholy day a few months ago , I made a mind map to address why I was stuck .
It had its normal cognitive stuff , and when I was done , I was n’t settled .
Just playing around , I added a feelings bubble along each major dimension of my life .
The feelings that came up for my business were : afraid , alone , vulnerable , failure , fraud , and ineffective .
Instead of trying to make myself feel something different , I just wrote what I was feeling .
Then I was able to ask some questions :
Why was I feeling alone ?
What could I do about it ?
What could I do about it ?
Why did I feel like a failure ?
What example was I using to compare my progress to ?
What example was I using to compare my progress to ?
Why did I feel like a fraud ?
Who was I cheating ?
And so on .
Once those feelings were out on the table , I could process them .
And after I started answering the questions , I saw that those feelings were just fleeting feelings , and it was okay to have them … but they did n’t correspond to the way the world was .
Once I accepted the way the world was , I understood that those feelings were n’t my own – they where just the trash , noise , and shit sandwiches that pessimistic people are all too eager to share with others .
I returned to the cognitive parts of the mind map and kept going .
Unsurprisingly , I ended up with several pages of mind maps , and soon thereafter made the changes I needed to that propelled me on the path I ’m on now .
The point here is that why I was stuck had nothing to do with the cognitive things like ideas , thoughts , and relationships – it had everything to do with the way I was feeling .
That was they key insight then , and it had dramatic changes to the way I understood productivity .
( You ’ll hear much more about this soon . )
It ’s Not About Making Yourself Get Unstuck – It ’s About Letting Yourself Get Unstuck
If you ’re currently stuck or need a liberating boost , make a mind map and add a bubble for your feelings .
If you ’re good for now , make a note to give it a try .
Here a few key points :
Let yourself feel and write whatever it is that you ’re feeling .
You do n’t have to share it with anyone , and just because you feel it does n’t mean that it matches the way the world is .
Do n’t try to hide or resist what you feel , as it ’ll only make it worse .
Once you have an honest assessment about your feelings , start asking why you feel that way .
Do n’t judge how you should feel – just ask why you feel that way .
Where ’s it coming from ?
After you ’ve done some open question - asking , ask yourself whether that feeling had some validation from the world .
If it does , what can you do to change the world ?
If it does n’t , what can you do to listen to the world ?
Change the world if you need to ; trust the world if you do n’t .
I hope this helps you when you need it .
I know it helps me .

The Iqbal decision now requires plaintiffs to come forward with concrete facts at the outset , and it instructs lower court judges to dismiss lawsuits that strike them as implausible .

“ Determining whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief , ” Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the five - justice majority , “ requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense . ”
Note those words : Plausible .
Common sense .
The old world was mechanical .
A lawsuit that mouthed the required words was off and running .
As the Supreme Court said in 1957 in Conley v. Gibson , a lawsuit should be allowed to go forward “ unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief . ”
Things started to change two years ago , when the Supreme Court found a complaint in an antitrust suit implausible .
In the new world , after Iqbal , a lawsuit has to satisfy a skeptical judicial gatekeeper .
“ It obviously licenses highly subjective judgments , ” said Stephen B. Burbank , an authority on civil procedure at the University of Pennsylvania Law School .
“ This is a blank check for federal judges to get rid of cases they disfavor . ”
Courts applying Iqbal have been busy .
A federal judge in Connecticut dismissed a disability discrimination suit this month , saying that Iqbal required her to treat the plaintiff ’s assertions as implausible .
A few days later , the federal appeals court in New York dismissed a breach of contract and securities fraud suit after concluding that its account of the defendants ’ asserted wrongdoing was too speculative .
The judge hearing the claims of the falsely accused Duke lacrosse players has asked for briefing on whether their lawsuit against Durham , N.C. , can pass muster under Iqbal .
But the judge considering a case against John C. Yoo , the former Bush administration lawyer , said it could move forward despite Iqbal because the suit contained specific allegations about Mr. Yoo ’s conduct in justifying the use of harsh interrogation methods .
In the Iqbal case itself , Javaid Iqbal , a Pakistani Muslim who was working as a cable television installer on Long Island , said he was subjected to intrusive searches and vicious beatings after being arrested on identity fraud charges two months after the Sept. 11 attacks .
A new study reveals that unfair treatment of employees is damaging to mental health .
In organizational settings , managers as well as others in leadership roles should perhaps think twice before ridiculing subordinate employees on their choice of lunch , attire , or habits , or generally acting disrespectfully towards them .
Recent research from the Journal of Management Studies shows that when an employee believes that he or she has been treated unfairly , the employee is not likely to forgive and forget .
The research , headed by Michael S. Cole , PhD at the Texas Christian University , tracks the downward spiral process which is triggered when an employee experiences perceived injustices at the work .
Such events create a major stressor which may potentially lead to damaged psychological well being and extreme emotional exhaustion , which directly affect a worker 's ability to cope with workload demands and performance - related expectations .
These individuals are also likely to feel singled out within their work environment and may start to feel unhappy about their jobs as a whole , leading to a change in job - related attitudes and behavior .
This in turn leads to a general depletion in their sense of commitment to the organization , and in the worst - case scenario , an increased risk of voluntary termination and high turnover within organizations .

The current star of the Insurance Industry cabal is Shona Holmes , a whisky - voiced Toronto woman of ample aggregate and dubious honesty .
See TV Spot Here .
According to Ms Holmes , she was diagnosed with a “ brain tumor ” sometime in 2005 .
In scores of interviews , she consistently claimed she could not receive timely treatment in Toronto and was forced to seek medical care at the Mayo Clinic in Arizona .
Shona is a wannabe - be poster child for the Worldwide failings of government run Healthcare .
She spins a shocking yarn , one that would make Socialists everywhere bow their Public Option heads in shame –
if only her story was true .
Over the 4 years since Ms Holmes ’ cyst was removed from the ample cavity between her ears , her condition has worsened .
Not her actual physical condition , but rather , the ubiquitously reheard and revised description of her medical odyssey .
Back in the Summer of 2007 , the propaganda machine at the Mayo Clinic decided to print Ms Holme ’s human interest story in an internal Clinic publication .
Her healthcare horrors served nicely as a double - sided win for Mayo .
On one side was the sweet story about the Clinic ’s responsiveness to Ms Holme ’s plight as well as the Clinic 's ample expertise in repairing her medical problem .
Secondly , it served as a bonus dig against the growing call for Public Healthcare in the U.S. by painting the Canadian system in a negative light .
After all , the mere words " Public Healthcare " are the bane of the usury Private Insurance companies and Hospitals administrators alike .
But more interesting was the Mayo Clinic ’s choice to reprint
IMPORTANT UPDATE NOTE : THE " REPRINT " LINK IS NOW BROKEN - THE MAYO CLINIC REMOVED MS HOLMES ' STORY ( #39 ) FROM THEIR WEBSITE 2 DAYS AFTER THIS DIARY WAS PUBLISHED .
STORY #s 38 & 40 ABOUT OTHER MC PATIENTS ARE STILL UP .
THE MISSING HOLMES STORY MAY BE FOUND IN AN UPDATE # 4 , BELOW .
the story this Summer , and this time , afford it a prominent berth on their Web site – just in time for the Healthcare reform battle .
Yet , the most fascinating information was to be found in the Mayo Clinic ’s own description of Ms Holme ’s medical condition .
Quoting the Clinic :
" Dr. Naresh Patel , neurosurgeon , diagnosed Holmes as having a Rathke 's cleft cyst ( RCC ) .
The rare , fluid - filled sac grows near the pituitary gland at the base of the brain and eventually can cause hormone and vision problems .
Dr. Patel joined forces with Drs. David W. Dodick , neurologist , and Michael D. Whitaker , endocrinologist , to work on Holmes ' case . "
Rathke ’s Cleft Cyst can indeed cause more serious symptoms if left untreated , but it is generally very treatable through minimally invasive surgery and NOT a “ brain tumor ” as both Ms Holmes and Right wing hack writers contend .
It 's a fluid build - up and has nothing to do with cell division as occurs in Tumors .
Additionally , the direness in the retelling of Ms Holmes ’ story grew progressively more horrifying after the Presidential election and as the Healthcare battle began to percolate .
Horror stories of waiting non-specific " months " for treatment in Canada soon gave way to claims of four to six month delays ( an experience 180 degrees contrary to that of the scores of Canadians I 've personally seen or heard quoted on the subject ) .
Here is a modest sampling of the plethora of Right Wing reportage on our Ms Holmes :
Sept 7 , 2007
" In spite of these symptoms - and an MRI scan revealing the tumour causing them - Ontario's health system told Shona that she would have to wait four months to see a neurologist and six months to see an endocrinologist . "
July 15 , 2008
" Shona found out that the free health care she was promised came with life threatening strings .
She was told that she could not see a specialist for at least six months ... six months which , according to the Mayo Doctors , she did n't have the luxury of waiting for . "
The tumor claim was no misquote , for on every occasion , Holmes did n’t hesitate to confirm this bogus diagnosis .
Obviously , a tumor sounds bad – whereas a cyst , albeit a surgically complex one to excise , sounds like no more than a glorified pimple .
If you want sympathy , go with the tumor alibi .
Here ’s just one of many examples from Shona ’s personal press tour that began anew just as the general election campaign was about to heat up .
July 19 , 2008
“ No one should be forced to travel thousands of miles to obtain accessible good care .
Yet that is exactly what I was forced to do after being diagnosed with a brain tumor three years ago . ”
By May of this year , Shona ’s tall story was to take another turn for the worse - this time , courtesy of Fox News , and just in time for the shank of the Healthcare debate now raging on the Hill .
Shona had become the star of her own :30 second TV spot , engendered through the combined effort of Wingnut fantasy and Insurance Industry money .
Now , Shona was to get her 15 minutes of fame on Fox News , dutifully and dramatically retelling her story for the umpteenth time – but this time with a twist that only Fox News could conjure .
As Shona is introduced to Fox viewers , the Chyron reads :
" Cancer Patient Says Canadian Health Care Nearly Killed Her . "
patient
It seems nothing short of “ brain cancer ” would be sufficient for " Faux News " ..
Certainly , no one would confuse a " brain cancer " diagnosis with a pimple !
Poor Shona Holmes – at this rate of deterioration , she ’ll be dead by …well … 2005 .
UPDATE Courtesy of Numinous :
" Her ( Holmes ) treatment at the Mayo Clinic in Arizona cost $ 100,000 , and she and her husband put a second mortgage on their home and borrowed from family and friends to pay for it . "
As Numinous commented , that fact alone proves the point that we need healthcare reform in this country .

UPDATE 3 : And this Diary from June , written by SaraBeth , an American living in Canada .
Thanks for your comment , and for pointing the way to your personal experience with a quality healthcare system .
UPDATE 4 : Here is the copy from Shona Holmes ' story as it appeared on the Mayo Clinic 's Web site before the Clinic mysteriously shut it down :
Shona Holmes was in trouble :
The list of her symptoms included headaches ,
sleeplessness , dizziness , low libido and , worst of all , rapidly deteriorating vision .
Her family
doctor in Canada ordered an MRI , and a brain tumor was detected .
But it would take
months for her to get on the appointment calendar of a neurologist or endocrinologist in
Canada .
" I knew in my gut that I had to see someone and could not wait five to six months , " she
says .
So she called Mayo Clinic and got an appointment the same day .
For Holmes , a 31 - year - old native of Waterdown , Ontario , traveling far from her husband ,
other family members and friends was difficult .
She knew there would be several
appointments and a battery of diagnostic tests .
But she knew it had to be done .
So , flying
solo , she headed for Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale , Arizona .
Once there , her fears were instantly calmed .
" I received the most humane treatment of my
entire life , " she says .
" Everything was wonderful — the ambiance — from my treatments to
my first encounter at the check - in registration desk , every physician and nurse , was absolutely out of this world . "
Dr. Naresh Patel , neurosurgeon , diagnosed Holmes as having a Rathke 's cleft cyst ( RCC ) .
The rare , fluid - filled sac grows near the pituitary gland at the base of the brain and eventually can cause hormone and vision problems .
Dr. Patel joined forces with Drs. David W. Dodick , neurologist , and Michael D. Whitaker , endocrinologist , to work on Holmes ' case .
Their further tests revealed an increase in the size of her cyst over a short period of time as well as progressively worsening vision .
" I was concerned that the pressure on Shona 's nerves were causing her to become blind , " says Dr. Patel .
" We needed to remove the cyst to save her vision . "
No time to waste
Within 10 days , Holmes returned to Canada with a confirmed diagnosis — and a growing sense of dread .
She needed brain surgery immediately , and the thought of leaving home again was daunting : " Traveling so far from home and being far away from my family was a big deal for me , and then having them go into my brain — this was huge ! "
Holmes returned to Mayo Clinic for several weeks of tests , and then got ready for the surgery .
This time , her husband , David , was by her side .
By accessing Holmes ' brain through her nose and sinuses , surgeons were able to remove
the cyst without a single incision on her face .
Holmes was discharged from the hospital
four days later , cured of her disease .
" I 've never been sorry for a second , " says Holmes .
" And how fortunate I was to have Dr. Patel as my surgeon . "
When she first saw Dr. Patel , Holmes had lost half the vision in her right eye and 25 percent in her left eye .
After the surgery , her vision was 100 percent restored .
" Dr. Patel is my hero , " she says .
" We laughed , giggled and cried together . "
Holmes said she also was comforted by the fact that some of her doctors were Canadian .
" It made me realize there really are no borders , " she says .
She 's safely back in Canada now , reunited with family , friends and her golden retriever , Magnum .
" It was a big deal leaving home for treatment , and not having that support with me in Arizona , " she says .
" But my husband was
determined to get me help — and I found it at Mayo . "

Two teens attempt to rob police station which they thought was a store and get caught .
LAST month ten - year - old Azharuddin Ismail was woken in the middle of the night by the sound of bulldozers .
As policemen beat him with a bamboo stick to shoo him and his family away , his home in Mumbai 's slums was swiftly demolished .
Azhar , a celebrity since appearing in the film “ Slumdog Millionaire ” , has since been given a new home by the filmmakers .
But other residents were not so fortunate .
Tata Housing
Small flats , big profits
India 's cities need at least 25 m more homes , according to report from McKinsey , a consultancy , and the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce .
In Mumbai , the commercial capital , more than 8 m people now live in shantytowns , often paying substantial rent for the privilege .
But buying a home of their own is way out of reach for most of them : a 70 - square - metre flat in the centre of the city costs $ 500,000 or so .
Matheran Realty is one of several firms that think they have a solution : ultra - low - cost housing .
In Karjat , 90 km east of Mumbai , Matheran Realty is in the process of building 15,000 flats with prices starting at just 210,000 rupees ( $ 4,500 ) for 19 - square - metre units .
Tata , the firm that makes the $ 2,500 “ Nano ” car , is building 1,300 basic units at Boisar , about 100 km north of the city , and may add more .
Priced at 390,000 - 670,000 rupees each , they are already oversubscribed .
Other firms are planning similar developments elsewhere in India .
The cost is being kept low chiefly because the flats are being built outside big cities , where land is much cheaper .
Owners are expected to commute .
The units are also very small and spartan .
The simplest consist of a single room with a sink in the corner and a toilet behind a partition .
They are in buildings of no more than three storeys , so there is no need for expensive structural works .
Instead of bricks , lightweight moulded concrete blocks are used for the walls .
The concrete is often made with foam , fly - ash or other waste materials to make it lighter as well as cheaper .
There are no lifts and just one staircase per block .
All this means that the homes can be built very quickly and with unskilled labour .
The developers say the potential for very cheap housing in India is huge .
Many of those living in slums today are employed as drivers , factory workers or tailors , with incomes of around 90,000 rupees a year — easily enough to afford a flat which costs 200,000 - 400,000 rupees .
According to Ashish Karamchandani of Monitor Group , another consulting firm , India has 23 m urban families with incomes of 60,000 - 130,000 rupees a year .
Including rural areas , Tata Housing sees an even larger market of 180 m households earning between 90,000 and 200,000 rupees .
Until very recently one of the biggest hurdles was finance .
Banks were unwilling to lend money to people without credit histories or proof of permanent residence .
But two government - owned banks — the National Housing Bank and the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development — have agreed to provide funds to finance companies so that they can offer mortgages to such buyers .
To reduce risk , buyers must put down at least a quarter of the purchase price and employers must confirm their income .
Borrowers are then charged little more interest than those with an established credit history .
Lenders and developers are convinced that they have struck gold .
Who would have guessed that the combination of subprime loans and a building boom would have become attractive again so soon ?

Time To Refinance – For Real This Time
For the past few months we ’ve been looking into refinancing our mortgage .
Our interest rate on our current mortgage is at 6.5 % .
Since mortgage rates have been hovering around the low to mid 5 percent range since the beginning of the year we knew we wanted to refinance – before the rates disappeared again .
We were about to refinance our loan through the Making Home Affordable Refinance Program in February or March , but my wife ended up in the hospital for surgery .
We had to put it off .
Unfortunately because we delayed our refinance I think we missed our chance at a 5 % ( or lower ) interest rate .
We ’ve now paid off all of our hospital bills from earlier this year , and last week we restarted the process of refinancing our home .
Thankfully we ’re still reducing our interest rate through this refinance by over a full point .
The costs of the refinance will be repaid in just over a year , and after that it ’s all gain !
Now that we ’ve applied for a loan , and locked in our rate , we ’ve received a good faith estimate ( GFE ) .
A GFE must be provided by a mortgage lender or broker in the United States to a customer , as required by the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ) .
The estimate must include an itemized list of fees and costs associated with your loan and must be provided within three business days of applying for a loan .
( Hold on to this GFE because you ’ll be using it later to compare the actual final fees before your closing )
One of the most important documents that we ’ll be looking at before finalizing everything at the closing is the HUD - 1 Settlement Statement .
Today I thought I ’d take a look at this document in depth .
The HUD - 1 Settlement Statement – What Is It ?
The HUD - 1 Settlement Statement is the form that the settlement agent will use at your closing to itemize all charges that you as a buyer can expect to pay when buying or refinancing your house .
It will give everyone involved in the transaction ( buyers , sellers , agents , brokers ) a complete listing of their incoming and outgoing funds .
You should get a copy of your HUD - 1 at least one day prior to the settlement as required by the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ) .
The fees and charges that the HUD - 1 shows should match , or at least come close to the charges that were shown on the Good Faith Estimate ( GFE ) that you received when first investigating the loan or refinance .
If they do n’t , something might not be right .
When you get that HUD - 1 statement , make sure that you look it over closely , compare it to your GFE , and find any errors that may be present .
Easier to fix them now rather than later .
The HUD - 1 has several sections that you ’ll need to look over .
Sections A through I ( General Information )
The HUD - 1 starts with sections A through I which have basic information about your loan , the buyer , the seller , borrower and the home that you ’re buying .
Basic stuff .
Section J ( Summary of Borrower ’s Transaction )
Section J will have the gross totals of your costs , credits and the net amount that you will owe for the purchase of your home .
The totals are broken down by category :
100 . Gross Amount Due From Borrower :
This is the amount you ’ll owe for the house and will include the house ’s purchase prices , fees and settlement charges , and any other miscellaneous extras you may have bought from the seller – or any taxes that they have pre-paid .
( Line 120 is total . )
: This is the amount you ’ll owe for the house and will include the house ’s purchase prices , fees and settlement charges , and any other miscellaneous extras you may have bought from the seller – or any taxes that they have pre-paid .
( Line 120 is total . ) 200 . Amounts Paid By Or In Behalf of Borrower :
This section will detail amounts you have paid such as your deposit , or financed , like your new mortgage .
It will also include any money that the seller owes to you such as unpaid taxes , utility costs or any repair allowances that have been made during negotiation .
( Line 220 is total . )

It will also include any money that the seller owes to you such as unpaid taxes , utility costs or any repair allowances that have been made during negotiation .
( Line 220 is total . ) 300 . Cash at Settlement From / To Borrower :
This section will show the actual amount of money that you must bring to the settlement .
It will be the gross amount from line 120 minus the credits from line 220 .
( Line 303 is total . )
Section K ( Summary of Seller ’s Transaction )
This section will have a listing of the gross amount due to the seller , along with any necessary adjustments for items talked about above – like if the seller has unpaid or prepaid taxes .
Section L ( Settlement Charges )
Section L , on the second page of the form , shows all the specific costs for financing and processing of the transaction .
It includes :
700 . Total Sales / Broker ’s Commission based on price :
The commission paid to the real estate broker .
: The commission paid to the real estate broker .
800 . Items Payable In Connection With Loan :
Things included in this section will include things like the loan origination fee , any discount points you have paid to reduce the mortgage rate , the appraisal fee and credit report fee , the application fee for mortgage insurance ( thankfully we do n’t have PMI ! ) , and the assumption fee , if you ’ve assumed an existing mortgage .
Fees you ’ve paid up front are marked P.O.C. ( paid outside of closing ) and will not be included in the total on Line 1400 .

Reserves Deposited With Lender :
These escrow items will be held by the lender , and in some cases required to be held .
Items included here would be things like property taxes and other annual assessments .
In some cases you ’ll be asked to pay a monthly escrow amount for insurance or homeowner ’s association fees here as well .
There is a maximum that can be charged .

The costs of changing ownership of the property , such as the settlement or closing fee , title examination fee and attorney ’s fee .
If the fee is payable to a third party , such as the notary or attorney , it is indicated .

Additional Settlement Charges :
Other items such as surveys , inspections for such things as pests and lead - based paint , and home warranties .
These are not always included , depending on where you ’re buying , and the circumstances .

1400 .
Total Settlement Charges :
The sum total of all of the fees listed in the HUD - 1 .
The amount listed in the buyer ’s ( or borrower ’s ) column should be identical to the amount listed as “ settlement charges to borrower ” on page one , line 103 , while the amount in the seller ’s column should be the same as the “ settlement charges to seller ” on page one , line 502 .
It ’s important to read through the HUD - 1 form carefully and determine that it ’s complete and accurate .
You and the settlement agent will then both sign it to authorize payment of the funds .
Once that ’s done , the home is yours ( or your refinance is complete ) .
Have you ever been in a situation where you discovered an error in your HUD - 1 ?
Do you have other questions or things you ’re confused about with the HUD - 1 Settlement Statement ?
Let us know about it in the comments !
[ digg - reddit - me ] Implicit in many of Obama ’s policy proposals and programs is an assumption shared by many reformers ( from here to here to here ) : that America ’s political system is broken and that our traditional democratic institutions just are n’t up to the job of managing serious and difficult areas and making rational , long - term decisions when the payoff only comes after policy - makers are out of office .
I ’m not sure that they ’re wrong – but I ’m wary of the decision made by the Obama administration to focus on creating a technocracy to manage these areas .
In many of Obama ’s programs and proposals , there is a bureaucratic independent or quasi - independent agency that is designed to manage whatever process is relevant to the program and that receives from the Congress authority to make decisions on its own .
To the technocrats ’ credit , in most cases , although the decision - making is outsourced to these agencies , Congress has some sort of limited veto over them .
The appeal of outsourcing authority to these institutions comes from the fact that they are theoretically insulated from politics and are capable of making minor decisions over a long period of time which – if managed properly – can effect significant changes .
The idea is that – rather than forcing through a controversial and wholesale change – you set up an independent agency that will gradually manage things in order to achieve the changes needed .
This makes a great deal of sense politically – as the agency can be tasked with some anodyne goal that everyone can agree on – and as it makes controversial decisions , politicians can distance themselves from each individual decision while still supporting the independence of the organization ( as you often see with the Federal Reserve ) .
They can say they did n’t vote for this or that specific proposal – and that they oppose it – but that given the authority of this independent agency , there ’s little they can do .
On a policy level , this also makes sense – as any attempt to push through wholesale reform is limited by one ’s knowledge at the time the legislation is drafted .
Better to experiment and try various small steps and set up different incentives to accomplish the same thing than to attempt to impose some pre-made solution .
It ’s also worth noting that these technocratic institutions are often supported on a bipartisan basis – while specific reforms are generally opposed by one side or the other .
The appeal is obvious – yet the anti-democratic impulse is disturbing .
One example of these organizations is the IMAC ( or Independent Medical Advisory Committee ) which would be a technocratic institution that would set the pay rates for reimbursement of various Medicare programs and eventually perhaps for all government - sponsored insurance ( as MedPAC does now ) and also compare and evaluate what treatments work best to treat different conditions and make recommendations .
Unlike MedPAC which simply advises Congress , IMAC would make annual recommendations which would take effect if accepted by the president and not vetoed by the Congress .
The White House has been selling this plan as a way to take the politics out of Medicare reimbursements and restrain costs .
A similar approach helps explain why Obama is pushing for the Federal Reserve ( the organization to which the IMAC is most often compared ) to be the regulator of those institutions that are “ too big to fail ” as well as tracking and regulating various other systematic risks – despite their role in the collapse that just occurred .
What the Federal Reserve is known for is its independence from political pressure and its technocratic bent , thus making it the perfect vehicle for Obama ’s efforts to reform the financial industry even though it clearly failed so recently .
There is the proposal for a National Infrastructure Bank which would direct federal transportation money – again , independent of political concerns .
The cap - and - trade program would likewise gradually institute dramatic reforms by giving authority over to a technocratic institution that would manage carbon emissions – distancing these actions from politically accountable leaders .
On each individual proposal , the solution seems compelling , but as an overall trend , it is disturbing .
When Obama was elected , many claimed that there was a similar feeling of hope and progress to when John F. Kennedy was elected – and as then , when Kennedy gathered “ the best and the brightest , ” Obama has reinvigorated the idea of public service .
But the downfall of these Kennedy men was their belief that they could “ control events , in an intelligent , rational way . ”
Obama ’s technocrats do not seem to have this same hubris .
Their hubris is of a different variety : they believe that they can best manage complex areas and achieve needed reforms not through political action but by creating bureaucracies onto which they put the difficult political decisions .
But what kind of system do we end up with then ?
As rules and regulations are created by technocrats and then merely accepted or rejected by the elected officials .
This system seems to resemble an oligarchy with democratic checks .
With the Federal Reserve along with other less independent agencies already deputized to take care of most government responsibilities , we have already started down this road – but it does n’t seem wise to double down on this approach .
Unfortunately , I do not offer a solution – only a concern .

How badly did the Cleveland Plain Dealer 's Ted Diadiun screw up in his now - infamous video in which he disparaged bloggers as " pipsqueaks " , wrongly claimed that blogs steal content and hailed newspapers as the only legitimate source of journalism ?
Here 's how badly .
This past Monday , a week after his self - immolation , Diadiun came in on his day off – just hours before the rehearsal dinner for his daughter 's wedding – to eat a healthy helping of crow , served to him by an amiable but appalled colleague whose task was to walk Diadiun back from the brink and undo at least some of the damage .
Diadiun , semi-contrite , probably played the hand he'd been dealt – that he'd dealt himself – about as well as he could .
The wonder is that he could have unleashed such a boneheaded amalgam of arrogance and ignorance in the first place .
Diadiun is the Plain Dealer 's " reader representative " , a position roughly analogous to those held by New York Times public editor Clark Hoyt and Washington Post ombudsman Andy Alexander .
That is , he is the paper 's in - house critic , fielding complaints and comments from readers .
He writes a column that appears in the Sunday paper and sits for a live , 15 - to 20 - minute webcast from the newsroom on Mondays .
Diadiun 's downfall began with a colleague 's bad idea .
On 5 July , he wrote approvingly of a column by Connie Schultz in which she promoted a proposal to change the copyright law .
The proposal – similar to one advanced by federal appeals - court judge Richard Posner – would ban bloggers and aggregators from linking to copyrighted content without permission for 24 hours after publication .
The next day , Diadiun expanded on that theme in his webcast .
" As soon as we get the newspaper on our website , it 's fair game for any website , blogger or anybody else to put it on their own website for free , " he said .
" It all comes from newspapers , and without that I do n't know where bloggers and internet news sites would even get their stuff . "
He expressed the view that Schultz should not have responded to criticism from new - media advocate and Guardian contributor Jeff Jarvis ( whom he could not bring himself actually to name ) , claiming that her 25,000 to 30,000 monthly readers " has to be many times more than this guy gets on his blog " .
( Web measurements are notoriously unreliable .
But according to Compete.com , Jarvis 's blog , Buzz Machine , attracted nearly 67,000 unique visitors last month . )
Diadiun also dismissed bloggers as " a bunch of pipsqueaks out there talking about what the real journalists do " .
And when he was asked to respond to a reader who wanted to know if he could identify any examples of blogs that have posted the full text of Plain Dealer articles , Diadiun disparaged the questioner , with whom he had apparently tangled before , as someone who " does n't play fair " .
Diadiun then ran out the clock by praising the wonders of the obit page for the remainder of the webcast .
Whew .
" Bonfire of the curmudgeons " , wrote New York University 's Jay Rosen on his widely read Twitter feed .
Writing for Salon , King Kaufman proclaimed Diadiun 's performance to be " a stunning example of newspaper - industry hubris and cluelessness " .
I posted the video on my blog , Media Nation , and sent Diadiun an e-mail asking him to respond to a few polite ( more or less ) questions .
Crickets are chirping .
To his credit , Diadiun played nice this past Monday with the Plain Dealer 's " News Impact " editor , John Kroll .
Diadiun admitted , essentially , that he did n't know what he was talking about when he claimed that bloggers do n't do original reporting , and that he should n't have guessed at Jarvis 's readership without checking .
He did stick to his guns on the need for news organisations to get paid for their content .
On that many of us would agree – though the copyright revision of which he and Schultz are so enamoured is stunningly awful , and possibly a violation of the first amendment .
The point has been made so many times by me and others that I suppose I ought to program a macro to save myself the bother of typing it again .
In linking to , briefly quoting from and commenting on content they find on other websites , bloggers and aggregators are driving traffic to those sites , including the Plain Dealer 's , which received some 1.3 million unique visits last month .
It is an unfortunate fact of life that web advertising has not proved particularly lucrative .
But whenever Google News or a blogger sends readers to the Plain Dealer 's website , Cleveland.com , the number of people who see the site 's advertising goes up .
That 's why programmers for most news sites try to optimise their results on Google searches , and why virtually no one inserts the code Google makes available to exclude their sites from such searches .
Ted Diadiun is no doubt a good guy .
His love of newspapers , and of newspapering , is palpable .
But the reader representative , of all people , needs to understand the forces that are transforming his business .
At a time when the very survival of newspapers , whether in print or online , is in some doubt , the last thing we need is a supposed advocate for readers whose real agenda , it would seem , is allegiance to a way of newsroom life that was out of date five years ago .
Journalists can either take part in the conversation or consign themselves to irrelevance .
Ted Diadiun has made his choice .
For the sake of the news business , let 's hope there are n't too many out there who still think like he does .
site:www.techcrunch.com intext:porn
1 ) 1st Time Visitors : Assuming 3 page views per visit , with 286,625 visits , TechCrunch would receive just under 900,000 page views per month .
And to take this a step further , assume TechCrunch earns $ 2.00 per click ( which is simply a guestimate for contextual ads on a site serving their own ads ) , this would mean TechCrunch is making tens of thousands of dollars each month by doing their Ron Jeremy - esque SERP countdown .
High Estimate :
Low Estimate :
2) Return Visitors ( subscribers ) :
If TechCrunch made their money selling crafts , porn traffic would do little to their bottom line .
But they do n't .
They make their money off ads .
And the more page views they have , the more impressions and clicks they get .
And nothing drives page views and engagement like return visits from blog subscribers .
So unlike other sites that could blog about porn and not acquire any new customers from the traffic , TechCrunch , who caters to a tech geek demographic , is uniquely positioned to profit from PHP privy porn perusers .
In 1970 porn was a 10 million dollar industry .
Today , the porn industry pulls in close to a billion dollars .
According to Alexa , four of the hundred most trafficked sites on the web are porn sites .
Additionally , Google has a monthly volume of over 100 million porn related searches and that number is only increasing .
Needless to say , the saying holds true on the web : sex sells .
But the results in the x rated SERPs are not all what you might think .
Amidst the porn stars and production companies , you will also find thousands of TechCrunch articles .
In the last year alone , TechCrunch made over 550 blog posts with the word porn in body of the post .
In some cases the articles addressed popular , newsworthy stories such as the much talked about iPhone porn app , but in a number of cases the stories were a bit more of a stretch .
Newsworthy or not , TechCrunch blogs about porn when they have the opportunity .
And though the porn related articles they write typically do n't top the SERPs , they do rank on the first 1 - 3 pages for a number of high volume porn related queries , including terms such as ' youporn , ' ' you porn , ' and 'iphone porn .
' What does this mean for TechCrunch 's traffic ?
Well , based on monthly search volume , if you assume industry average SERP click through rates , it 's not unreasonable to estimate that TechCrunch generates over a quarter million visits a month from x rated queries .
TechCrunch also optimizes porn posts for users , not just search engines .
Often they do this by including mildly risque above the fold images in blog posts .
In addition to having a positive impact on decreasing bounce rates for first time visitors who arrive from porn queries , these thumbnails likely have high click through rates when articles are picked up on Techmeme and other news aggregators .
And like other TechCrunch blog post images , these risque images are not hyperlinked , which encourages more clicks on the c column advertisements .
In TechCrunch 's defense , they are not alone .
Wired also does their their fare share of porn blogging , but these two seem to be outliers compared to other tech news sites .
If you look at pages containing ' porn ' as a percentage of total pages on the site in Google 's index , there is a clear line indicating that TechCrunch and Wired each have a higher percentage of porn related content than other popular tech news sites .
What about you ?
Are you leaving revenue opportunities on the table ?
Would your site drive conversions if your posts ranked on high volume , porn related search terms ?
Perhaps there is tremendous opportunity here for you ?
Even if there is n't , at least there is never any shortage of online marketing boobs and SEO anal - ytics tools to blog about .------
Maryann increasingly represents all that ’s dark and dangerous , in contrast to our master vampire .
Just when Godric ’s Christian virtues look to be ushering in a new era , a terrorist attack provides a cliffhanger that jeopardizes the lives of , oh , most of the cast .
We ’d snicker about knowing by now that only old age kills this show ’s major likable characters — but we enjoyed this episode too much to complain .
A Sacrifice
The Lovers card , says Lafayette as he reads Tara ’s tarot , calls for a sacrifice in matters of the heart ; she ’s going to have to make a choice .
Just as Lafayette pulls the next card , Justice , Eggs bursts into Merlotte ’s , tearfully telling Tara that he can’t remember the last few hours , though he ’s sure he ’s done something bad .
What ’s the only thing hotter than Lafayette in a “ Bitch ” T - shirt getting witchy ?
Maryann sautéing a human heart in mirepoix .
She ’s making a hunters ’ soufflé .
Even Eggs realizes that this dish does n’t make any sense , but he and Tara are up for a snack anyway .
Even if it ’s oozing blood .
Flash - forward to postprandial bliss and Eggs ’ saying he feels like a superhero and ripping off his shirt .
Tara announces she hates him , which then erupts in a frenzy of violence and sex .
She kicks him in the crotch , their irises turn black , and Maryann discreetly leaves them to their copulating on the rug .
A mysterious phone call has brought Sam back to his bar , where he discovers Daphne dead in the walk - in freezer with her heart cut out .
He grabs some trash bags to dispose of the body , thinks better of it , and calls the police — but they ’re already there , because whoever called him also called them .
Hi , Maryann .
Things do n’t look good for Sam : People keeping dying around Merlotte ’s , and the cops have noticed that nothing in his past checks out .
Detective Andy stumbles in and tries to tell the sheriff that the real culprit is a dress - wearing , claw - wielding bull , but Sam ca n’t even bother with that true tall tale .
Booty Count : Tara and Eggs again — and when Sam gets to jail , he finds that several of his patrons have been locked up for losing their pants , sodomizing pine trees , that sort of thing .
Wolves in the Henhouse
Jason is not dead .
For a second , it looks like he ’s asking himself why Sarah bothered to chase him down to shoot him with a toy .
No , he ’s just working himself up to this conclusion : “ God has saved me . ”
So the long - suffering Sarah has to explain that it was just a paintball and his fang - banging sister is here .
And to shoot him in the crotch , and to make the second Judas reference in two weeks , prompting Jason ’s brilliant query , “ What did he do to you ? ”
Meanwhile , Godric has saved Sookie and ordered Eric to spirit her away , but all she can do is bitch at Eric for not bringing Bill .
She asks whether Godric is Eric ’s maker ( “ Do n’t use words you do n’t understand ” ) and tells him how much he loves him ( “ Do n’t use words I do n’t understand ” ) .
And then she says some really stupid shit as a showdown blazes between the vampires and the Soldiers of the Sun .
Eric offers himself as a sacrifice , Bill shows up , Jason (! ) saves the day , but our heroine just stands there , pointing out stakes and saying it does n’t have to be that way .
She does manage one bit of action — rushing to untie Eric as soon as Bill frees her .
Just as Eric is about to kill Reverend Newlin , a Christlike Godric gives a speech ( more convincing than Sookie ’s ) about peace and coexistence .
Newlin tries to egg them on , confident that Jesus will protect him , so Godric reminds him , “ I ’m actually older than your Jesus .
I wish I could have met him . ”
He turns the other cheek and leads his followers back to his nest , where he also forgives Hugo and sends him and Isabel away .
There , Jason apologizes to Eric , but Eric ’s jealous that Jason got to play hero .
Bill is jealous because Eric has been going after Sookie — and he ’s not just talking about that crack Eric made about Sookie finding out what the bond between a vampire and a maker is like .
Lorena and Sookie meet — and they ’re both jealous .
Just as Lorena is about to bite Sookie , Godric intervenes , chastising her for not growing spiritually as a vampire and banishing her from his sheriffdom , asking Bill to escort her out .
Bill tells his humiliated , pining ex that he ’ll never see her again , but she reminds him they ’re immortal and their paths are bound to cross
As they talk , Luke walks into the party with a “ message ” from Rev. Newlin : a bomb under his coat , rigged to an assortment of silver bullets and wooden arrows .
He pushes the button .
Best Line :
When Newlin warns him that in the end they ’ll see who goes to heaven and who goes to hell , Jason responds , “ I reckon I ’ve already been to heaven .
I was inside your wife . ”
Booty Count : Jessica loses her virginity with Hoyt , and thanks to the vampiric powers of rejuvenation , will do so over and over .
The sentimental schmuck thinks this is pretty cool , but she points out that it hurts .
Bite Count : Lorena gets just enough of a nibble of Barry to note the telepath ’s unusual taste and wonder what he is … when Bill hits her over the head with a flat - screen TV .
Body Count : Possibly everyone from the Stackhouse / vampire plotline except Bill and Lorena … but probably not .
Herb Trimpe : If It Ain’t Fun , It Ain’t Comics
One of Marvel Comics ’ premiere artists , Herb Trimpe became renowned in the Seventies for drawing The Incredible Hulk .
While Jack Kirby co-created the big green goliath , it was Trimpe who gave him his greatest , most memorable form .
Through his distinct visual style , he effectively brought out both the menace and sadness in the hounded alter ego of scientist Bruce Banner .
As a result of tackling the Hulk from the late Sixties through the first half of the Seventies , Trimpe was the first artist to draw Wolverine , who later became the most popular character in the famed X - Men franchise .
His considerable talents also landed him work on The Fantastic Four , The Mighty Thor , G.I. Joe , Marvel Team - Up and numerous other Marvel titles into the mid-Nineties .
Trimpe ’s name and work are legendary to life - long comics readers such as myself , and his work is inspiring younger artists as well .
I met Trimpe briefly at this year ’s New York Comic Con and really wanted to have him draw my portrait .
But I was on assignment and had limited time , plus there were always admirers at his table wanting a word , a portrait or simply a chance to watch a master in action .
So a few months later I contacted him directly through his website .
Taking a break from his busy activity , Trimpe conducted an interview with A.D.D. to fill us in on his recent activities , his thoughts on the Hulk ’s evolution over the years , the Marvel movies and much , much more .
Next time you ’re in NYC , Herb , I ’m getting that portrait !
What was it like working with Mike Mignola on BPRD : War On Frogs last year ?
Did you make any conscious attempts to emulate his style at all , or did you just interpret the characters as you saw fit ?
Very easy , low key .
When we communicated , it was via e-mail .
Not being that familiar with the characters , I tried to keep them true to the originals .
How did the process of working on that series differ from the classic Marvel Comics you worked on ?
Stan [ Lee ] never worked with scripts — at least not by the time I got there .
The Marvel way , Stan ’s way , had the artist visualize the pictures from brief plot lines .
The script followed for the letterer ’s benefit .
On BPRD , I worked from a full script , but with leeway as to input I felt strongly about .
It ’s actually harder to work from a full script because you are looking at the story through the writer ’s eyes , and it needs to be interpreted so it works for you , the penciler .
What do you think of the way comic book art has become more digital in its creation ?
I had n’t noticed except for the coloring .
That ’s fine , but I like hand - lettering more than lettering programs , no matter how clever they are .
The one thing that ’s fantastic about comics is the original art is produced the way it was 70 or 80 years ago — hand - drawn with a pencil and eraser and finished with pens , brushes , India ink and nowadays , markers .
What has been your favorite comic book and comic character to draw out of your entire career and why ?
Probably the Hulk .
We had a lot of fun on that one , and it was early enough on that the corporate sharks had n’t eaten the company alive yet .
I noticed that when you worked with inker Jack Abel , such as on Iron Man , that your art took on a more Kirby - esque style .
Was that conscious ?
If true , it ’s a coincidence .
What you see is probably what Jack Abel ’s contribution brought to the strip .
Are there any villains that you ’d like to see in future Iron Man movies ?
I think Commander Kraken the pirate could be a fun one .
Not any I can think of .
Iron Man was the best movie of the superhero lot , in my opinion .
It was mature and intelligently presented with a nice touch of humor , appealing not just to comic fans .
You have to be careful not to select a silly villain .
The X - Men were good , but most of the villains that appear in movies come off as pretty silly .
You ’ve got to be careful who you choose .
You worked on The Incredible Hulk for several years and were its best artist .
What did you like most about working on that series ?
Thanks for the compliment .
On the Hulk , the stories were varied and fun .
Each writer involved got into the character and basically , we had a ball .
In comics , fun is the operative word .
If it ai n’t that , it ai n’t comics .
There came a time when a lot of people in the business started taking themselves too seriously , both in management and on the creative end .
If you ’re not having a good time , what ’s the point ?
What do you think of the more oversized and grotesque depictions of the Hulk since the late Eighties ?
Stupid .
It ’s become homogenized .
There was a time when there was no doubt who did the art .
You had an Everett or a Romita , or a Buscema , Ditko or Kirby — very distinct styles .
I think the Japanese influence on American comics has been detrimental — manga and so forth .
Modern - day comic books are distinctly an American cultural thing , in my opinion , like rock ‘n roll or baseball .
We do it best .
The more distinct the artists ’ styles are , the more fun .
Again , fun is the point .
Are you not a fan of any manga ?
It was somewhat attractive at first , but I got bored with it .
What do you think of the two theatrical Hulk films ?
Why do you think they failed to catch on in the way that the Spider - Man and X - Men franchises have ?
They were n’t good .
The Hulk is nothing without Banner .
You ’ve got to play the Hulk as a victimized Bruce Banner — that he ’s a beast , but he ’s also human .
This is basically the human condition .
It ’s the pathos of playing the two manifestations against each other .
The story of the Hulk is a sad story first , not a violent one .
His violence is the result of his condition , like Frankenstein ’s monster .
I think these are the elements that made the character successful in the comics .
Pretty good .
I am working on a computer comic with a couple of other people as we speak .
Comic book movies and television shows are huge , but that does not seem to be affecting the sale of comic books .
Why do you think that is , and do you think we ’ll see an upswing in sales in the future ?
Whatever comic sales are now , they were a whole lot better thirty years ago in terms of individual titles , even though the characters were generally less known — Batman and Superman being the exception .
I think the movies and TV shows have had a very positive effect on overall comic sales .
Hulk had a TV show and that probably helped sales back then .
Nowadays , sales are split between so many titles that individual titles do n’t sell as well as they used to .
If anything , the movies have brought the characters to more people , probably creating a greater , broad - based interest .
The hope is this will continue to build the print readership .
How did the Marvel Comics bankruptcy in the mid-1990s affect you ?
I got fired .
Actually , “ terminated ” was the word .
There was n’t any more work to be had , at least for me .
We all saw it coming , those of us who were let go , and for me , it was basically a salaried position that I was let go from .
In all fairness , I was totally free to seek work on a freelance basis , but call it what you like , if there ai n’t no work , there ai n’t no work .
That said , I was affected in a very positive way .
I was forced to move on .
I had n’t been having a whole lot of fun drawing comics , and had realized for several months , if not years previously , it was time to go .
I just needed a shove .
No .
I hear he ’s still an energetic whirlwind of activity .
God bless him .
After your departure from Marvel , how did teaching aspiring artists for two years change your life ?
What is the best advice you can give to students ?
Practice .
Something I had no patience for .
It kept me from being the complete comic book artist — but I was / am a very good storyteller and that came naturally .
I do n’t like to do things I have to work at .
Teaching was a tough job .
Much tougher than comics .
All teachers should get the civilian version of the Medal of Honor .
Outsiders do n’t have a clue as to what really goes on , and teachers tend to keep that kind of thing inside the loop .
When did you become an ordained deacon , and why did you choose to write The Power of Angels ?
I was ordained a deacon by the Episcopal Diocese in New York in 1991 .
The book was a compilation of material that was journaled during the 9/11 recovery process at Ground Zero in New York in order to process the events that took place while I was volunteering there .
It helped to put things in order .
The distilled version of the journal became the book , and the book was mainly published for friends and family so they could get an idea of what went on there .
If there was any money to be made , which there was n’t , it was to go to a charity to be designated by me .
Which comic story are you most proud of having written ?
I did n’t write many , but the ones I wrote were good .
My favorites were the ones for the [ G.I. ]
Joe books .
What projects are you working on and do you have coming up ?
Mostly commissions .
Redrawing the same old stuff .
Not creative , but it supplements Social Security nicely .
Plus , a comic story for a West Coast rock band [ Orphaned To Hatred ] as a promotional piece .
And , as I mentioned before , the online comic .
Very top secret , but violence and blood are notched - up several levels .
And the story , not mine , is excellent .
A team of researchers working with data from ESA ’s Integral gamma-ray observatory has disproved theories that some form of dark matter explains mysterious radiation in the Milky Way .
That this radiation exists has been known since the 1970s , and several theories have been proposed to explain it .
Integral ’s unprecedented spectral and spatial resolution showed that it strongly peaks towards the centre of the Galaxy , with an asymmetry along the Galactic disc .
Several researchers have invoked a variety of dark matter to explain Integral ’s observations .
Dark matter is thought to exist throughout the Universe – undetectable matter that differs from the normal material that makes up stars , planets and us .
It is also believed to be present within and around the Milky Way , in the form of a halo .
The recent study has found that the ‘ positrons ’ fuelling the radiation are not produced from dark matter but from an entirely different , and much less mysterious , source : massive stars explode and leave behind radioactive elements that decay into lighter particles , including positrons , the antimatter counterparts of electrons .
The reasoning behind the original hypothesis was that positrons , being electrically charged , would be affected by magnetic fields and thus would not be able to travel far .
As the radiation was observed in places that did not match the known distribution of stars , dark matter was invoked as an alternative for the origin of the positrons .
But the recent finding by a team of astronomers led by Richard Lingenfelter at the University of California at San Diego , proves otherwise .
The astronomers show that the positrons formed by radioactive decay of elements left behind after explosions of massive stars are , in fact , able to travel great distances , with many leaving the thin Galactic disc .
Taking this into account , dark matter is no longer required to explain what Integral saw .
A better understanding of how positrons behave has explained the mysterious radiation in our Galaxy .
CORFU , Greece ( Reuters ) - The European Union on Sunday condemned Iran ’s crackdown on post-election protesters and said the EU would meet any Iranian intimidation of European diplomatic staff with a “ strong and collective response ” .
Britain's Foreign Minister David Miliband looks on ahead of an European Union Foreign Ministers meeting on Iran in Corfu June 28 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Yiorgos Karahalis
Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt , whose country takes over the EU presidency from Wednesday , said the Iranian government had been weakened at home and abroad .
“ Obviously the regime is trying to preserve its position by very harsh repression .
But that cannot hide the fact that this is a weakened regime .
It has lost legitimacy both internally and externally , ” Bildt said .
EU foreign ministers were meeting on the Greek island of Corfu to review strategy towards Iran , where mass protests over alleged vote rigging in a June 12 presidential election have prompted crackdowns by police and Islamic militia .
The ministers urged Iran to swiftly release several Iranian employees of Britain ’s Tehran embassy and a Greek journalist detained as alleged instigators of the street unrest .
“ The EU calls on Iran and its authorities to stop hostilities against EU member states as well as ( the ) EU ’s partner countries and their citizens , ” said Foreign Minister Jan Kohout of the Czech Republic , the current EU president .
“ The EU strongly denounces arbitrary arrests and repression against members of the civil society , ” he said .
“ ( We ) made clear to the Iranian authorities that harassment or intimidation of foreign and Iranian staff working at EU embassies ( in Tehran ) will be met with a strong and collective EU response , ” Kohout said , reading a joint communique .
Iran ’s biggest upswelling of popular dissent since the 1979 Islamic Revolution has been blamed by the Iranian leadership on foreign powers , mainly Britain and the United States , not popular outrage .
Western officials say such charges are absurd .
Iranian state media say 20 people have been killed
“ WEAKENED REGIME ”
Sweden ’s Bildt said it was too early to say what a “ strong and collective response ” could entail because the situation in Iran remained very fluid .
But the EU would monitor developments closely .
Iran detained several local British embassy staff , local media said on Sunday , escalating a spat with Britain which has been denounced as “ the most treacherous ” of Iran ’s adversaries by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
The EU ministers bemoaned the “ unjustified expulsion ” of two British diplomats and the arrest of the embassy employees .
The EU wanted Iranian authorities to offer full protection for embassy employees , as required by international conventions .
British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said four of a reported nine Iranian staff at Britain ’s Tehran embassy who were detained had since been freed and London was awaiting word on the release of the rest .
Kohout said the EU fully respected Iran ’s sovereignty but was alarmed about the continued internal political crisis .
Analysts dismissed talk that the EU could toughen sanctions against Iran , saying ministers did not want to close avenues to dialogue or risk fuelling accusations from Iranian hardliners that the election unrest was being incited by foreign meddling .
The Group of Eight industrialised powers on Friday deplored the violence stemming from Iran ’s police sweep against protesters but kept the door open for Iran to enter into talks on reining in its secretive nuclear programme .
From TPM Reader BR …
What I do n’t understand is why nobody has talked about Kennedy ’s Medicare for All act , which is an elegant solution for just that – a public option in which folks can buy into Medicare .
You ’re right that it makes no sense to not counter lies from Armey about the public option with “ expanding Medicare access to those under 65 ” rhetoric .
http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s110-1218
http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s109-2229
The reasons this needs to be a big part of the public debate :
– This was Kennedy ’s last piece of unfinished life work .
All those reporters who claim to know what Kennedy wanted are doing a disservice by not citing Kennedy ’s own legislation on the matter .
– Kennedy himself was personally pushing for a public option in the form of Medicare for All ( this negates any claim that Kennedy would have not supported a public option ) .
– This is an example of what he would have wanted to pass ( he reintroduced the bill , so it was n’t just some one - time idea of his ) .
– The bill was amazing in its simplicity , countering arguments that all health reform components are by nature arcane and indecipherable : every 5 years ( every 2 years in another version ) the eligibility for Medicare would be lowered by 10 years ( and raised from below by 10 years ) , with those under 65 being asked to check a box on their taxes if they signed up for Medicare ( to be charged for it ) .
It ’s a simple model for the public option , and hard ( er ) to lie about .
– I believe David Waldman at Daily Kos was correct when he pointed out that it would make sense for the public option to be the “ Kennedy plan ” ; irrespective of the politics , it would make sense because Kennedy ’s own bill was a public option bill , not a comprehensive reform package with 100 moving parts .
This is an idea whose time has come , and there ought to be robust public discussion about it .
A new chief executive takes the helm at Shell today .
Peter Voser will preside over a company which generated about $ 458bn revenue in 2008 and has operations in more than 100 countries , and at a time when the oil industry has never been under more scrutiny .
A Shell man since 1982 and said to be a " safe pair of hands " , Voser will be remunerated to the tune of more than £ 3 m .
At Amnesty we hope a concerted effort to turn around Shell 's appalling reputation in the Niger Delta will be at the top of the agenda of the first board meeting he leads .
Shell is by far the biggest oil firm operating in a region where in March 2008 it was estimated that at least 2,000 sites required treatment because of oil pollution – and some of these oil spills occurred years ago .
Independent oil and environmental experts estimate that between 9 m and 13 m barrels of oil have been spilt in the Delta area during the last 50 years – that 's the equivalent of an Exxon Valdez disaster every year .
A report by Amnesty today ( pdf ) finds that the cumulative effect of 50 years of oil exploration , extraction and spills is that many people in the Niger Delta have to drink , cook with , and wash in polluted water ; they have to eat contaminated fish – if they are lucky enough to still be able to find fish – and farm on spoiled land .
After oil spills the air reeks of pollutants .
Many have been driven into poverty , and because they can't make Shell accountable for its actions there is enormous distrust between the group and local people .
Those who have protested against the environmental damage that has ruined their lives have been victims of repression .
Shell recently settled out of court with relatives of Ken Saro - Wiwa and eight other people who were executed in 1995 , as well as victims of violence in Ogoniland , thereby avoiding a courtroom test of whether the company was complicit in these killings .
Today
Shell continues its operations in a place wracked by armed groups and criminal gangs , sabotage of oil facilities , theft of oil , and long - running disputes over how spills are to be cleaned up .
Usually
Shell says sabotage has caused a spill and therefore it is not liable ; local people say equipment failure is to blame ; and the Nigerian government refuses to effectively arbitrate .
The failure of the Nigerian government is a critical part of this story .
Oil is estimated to have earned Nigeria more than $ 600 bn since the 1960s , and the oil and gas sector represents about 80 % of government revenues .
Its reluctance to take on oil companies is not difficult to understand .
All many local people will ever see of the state are armed soldiers visiting the region to protect oil company assets .
Shell and the other oil operators are able to take advantage of this situation to carry on regardless knowing they will not be challenged .
The complexity of the situation has too often been used as an excuse for inaction by both the government and the oil firms .
It leads to vague commitments like those of Shell 's Malcolm Brinded on this site recently about it being " time to move on " and " move along the reconciliation process " .
What is urgently needed is some concrete and specific action from Shell to change the way it works in the Niger Delta .
Peter Voser could commit to cleaning up oil spills promptly , and adequately compensating those affected – and , critically , declare Shell 's support for effective independent regulation and promise not to lobby against this .
If fairness and the rule of law can be brought to truly control the oil industry in Niger Delta then maybe there really could be a new start for both local people and Shell .
Iraqi Soccer Team Plays First Home Game in Seven Years
After being forced to stay overseas for seven years because of the war in Iraq , the Iraqi soccer team has finally returned home to a cheering crowd .
In 2004 , Iraq ’s national soccer team finished fourth at the Athens Olympic games .
In 2007 , they beat the Saudi Arabian team in a surprise victory .
But despite the team ’s hard - won successes around the world , there ’s one thing they ’ve missed out on for the last seven years : the cheering of a home crowd .
Because of the war in Iraq , the soccer team has n’t had the opportunity to return to their homeland since 2002 , and had spent the years circling the globe , playing in whatever cities were safe enough to host them .
But on Monday night , the team finally made their way back to the old Shaab Stadium in Baghdad .
Although the stadium was n’t nearly as flashy as many of the ones they ’d played in over the years , the team received a hero ’s welcome .
The seating area was completely packed , with more than 25,000 fans crowding all the way into the aisles .
The noise of their cheers was deafening .
Things still are n’t perfect in Iraq — the players heard a car bomb explode nearby during their pre-game practice — but they finally feel safe enough to return to their homeland .
“ We are like someone who ’s been displaced from his house , ” the team ’s coach , Nadhim Shakir , told the New York Times .
“ Now , at last , he is going back . ”
The team defeated its Palestinian opponents 3 - 0 .
But at this particular game , even a defeat would have been cause for celebration .
“ We ’re tired of traveling , ” said goalkeeper Mohammed Gasad .
“ Now we have our own country . ”
Walt Staton wanted to help people , and his tool was a water jug .
On the morning of Dec. 4 , he and three others drove southwest from Tucson , to the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge , which tens of thousands of illegal immigrants traverse each year .
But the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said the plastic jugs he left for the immigrants endanger wildlife , and this week Staton was sentenced in federal court in Tucson on a charge of littering .
He was given one year of unsupervised probation and ordered to spend 300 hours picking up trash .
The sentence , however , does not quite capture the emotions surrounding the case -- yet another testament to the volatility of the illegal immigration debate in Arizona .
Prosecutors had asked for a $ 5,000 fine and five years ’ probation .
Staton , for his part , had insisted on a trial , rather than pay a $ 175 fine .
In recent months , as the legal proceedings progressed , each side has essentially accused the other of staging a show trial to bolster its view of U.S. border policy .

Staton , a 27 - year - old Web designer and soup kitchen volunteer , viewed his actions as humanitarian .
As he had done for five years with the faith - based aid group No More Deaths , Staton in December lugged water up hills and through scrub to remote , migrant - carved trails .
Only this time , when he and his comrades returned from leaving eight jugs at their last stop , authorities were waiting , and he was cited by a Fish and Wildlife Service officer .
Staton joined No More Deaths in 2004 , after graduating from the University of Arizona .
Volunteers hike the heavily trafficked refuge -- about 54,000 immigrants passed through in 2008 -- during often - sweltering days , offering food , water and medical help to anyone they find .
Some migrants have died while crossing the punishing desert .
But most border crossers travel at night , so No More Deaths also leaves water bottles along the refuge ’s 1,300 miles of migrant trails .
“ It ’s a human rights issue , from our perspective , ” group spokeswoman Danielle Alvarado said .
“ We have people crossing and dying in our desert . ”
Mike Hawkes , manager of the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge , said he has no problem with providing water to illegal immigrants -- another aid group , in fact , runs three stations , each with two 55 - gallon water drums and spigots .
Stray bottles , though , can endanger mule deer , mountain lions and other wildlife , which might eat chunks of plastic or catch their antlers or paws on them , he said .

The refuge , which also harbors the endangered masked bobwhite quail , is often strewn with backpacks , T - shirts , pants and a stadium ’s worth of water bottles , mainly from border crossings , Hawkes said .
He has suggested that No More Deaths chain jugs to trees so border crossers -- thought to each leave 5 to 8 pounds of trash -- can refill their water bottles , not dump them for new ones .
“ It was like they had blinders on : ‘ Put water bottles on the trails , that ’s all we can do , ’ ” he said .
After several verbal warnings , Hawkes said , a member of the group was cited for littering in February 2008 .
Daniel Millis received a suspended sentence and fine , which he is appealing , Alvarado said .
Advertisement
Staton , in turn , refused to pay the $ 175 fine and set off a more heated war of words .
The government , which Staton ’s lawyer estimated spent about $ 50,000 to prosecute him , broadly criticized him in a sentencing memo for what officially was a littering case .
Attorneys , for example , noted that No More Deaths volunteers often wrote “ buena suerte , ” or “ good luck , ” on the water jugs .
“ The obvious conclusion is that the defendant and No More Deaths wish to aid illegal aliens in their entry attempt , ” the memo said .
“ His actions are not about humanitarian efforts , but about protesting the immigration policies of the United States , ” the memo said .
A U.S. Attorney ’s Office spokeswoman declined to comment Wednesday .
Arguing that Staton had “ haphazardly left water for illegal aliens , drug smugglers and / or dangerous felons , ” prosecutors succeeded in persuading a judge to prohibit him from setting foot in the refuge during his probation .

A federal jury convicted Staton in June of littering , a misdemeanor , and U.S. Magistrate Judge Jennifer C. Guerin sentenced him Tuesday .
In addition to the probation and trash duty , he was banned from the 7 - mile - wide refuge that hugs the U.S. - Mexican border .
Staton , who considered the sentence too stiff , found the whole thing surreal .
In his mind , the prosecution was solely about immigration policy .
The Sierra Club and Center for Biological Diversity -- environmental groups that do n’t take littering lightly -- even submitted letters advocating a light sentence for him .
“ I wanted to make a point that humanitarianism is not a crime , and water ’s not littering , ” said Staton , who is moving to Pomona this month to attend the Claremont School of Theology .
In recent weeks , No More Deaths members flew to Washington and discussed quelling the squabble with Interior Department staffers .
But the group also readied itself for another battle :
Last month , 13 more volunteers were cited in the refuge for setting out water jugs .
Advertisement
The Arizona Daily Star concluded that both sides ended up looking petty :
“ Refuge officials , ” said an editorial , “ are coming across as heartless bureaucrats for confiscating water bottles that could potentially save lives .
. . .
No More Deaths , meanwhile , is coming off as a bunch of activists who refuse to follow the law . ”

The government was accused tonight of giving itself draconian powers to clamp down on protests at the 2012 Olympics .
Critics said the powers were so broad they would potentially give private contractors the right to forcibly enter people 's homes and seize materials .
Opposition parties and civil liberties groups criticised the powers as top security officials announced plans concerned with keeping the games , to be held mostly in London , safe from terrorist attack and from " domestic extremists " and public order problems like disruptive protests .
The legislation is directed at curbing advertising near the Olympic venues .
A government spokesperson said the laws , passed in 2006 , were meant to stop " over- commercialisation " of the games .
But civil rights campaigners are worried about several clauses in the London Olympic Games and Games Act 2006 .
Section 19 ( 4 ) could cover protest placards , they said , as it read : " The regulations may apply in respect of advertising of any kind including in particular – ( a ) advertising of a non-commercial nature , and ( b ) announcements or notices of any kind . "
Section 22 allows a " constable or enforcement officer " to " enter land or premises " where they believe such an advert is being shown or produced .
It allows for materials to be destroyed , and for the use of " reasonable force " .
The power to force entry requires a court warrant .
Causing still further concern is a section granting the powers to an enforcement officer appointed by Olympic Delivery Authority .
Anita Coles , policy officer for Liberty , said : " This goes much further than protecting the Olympic logo for commercial use .
Regulations could ban signs urging boycotts of sponsors with sweat shops .
Then private contractors designated by the Olympic authority could enter homes and other premises in the vicinity , seizing or destroying private property . "
The Liberal Democrats ' home affairs spokesman , Chris Huhne , said : " This sort of police action runs the risk of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut .
The police should take a deep breath and read the excellent report from the chief inspector of constabulary on the tolerance of protest .
We should aim to show the Chinese that you can run a successful Olympics without cracking down on protesters and free speech . "
Chris Grayling , the shadow home secretary , said : " This is a government who just does n't understand civil liberties – they may claim these powers wo n't be used but the frank truth is no one will believe them .
Neither the police nor any other official should be invading people 's homes for what appear to be commercial reasons . "
A senior government security official said the powers would not be used to suppress protests or political placards .
And the assistant commissioner , Chris Alison , in charge of the policing of the 2012 Olympics , said : " We are not going into people 's houses to stop people protesting . "
But Peter McNeil , who opposes the staging of equestrian events in Greenwich park , told BBC London : " This is dreadful .
It 's bullying taken to another level . "
A spokesperson for the Department for Culture , Media and Sport said the legal provisions on games advertising were meant to " prevent ambush marketing – not prevent or restrict lawful protests " .
Wrexham is a county and town in North Wales .
The county has a population of over 135,000 .
It is famous for Wrexham FC - the oldest football club in Wales .
It is also home to Glyndwr University .
With a large and varied population , Wrexham has more than 30 languages spoken across the county .
There is even a World Heritage Site in Pontcysyllte Aqueduct .

Full Story : http://www.davecarrollmusic.com/story/united-breaks-guitars -
In the spring of 2008 , Sons of Maxwell were traveling to Nebraska for a one - week tour and my Taylor guitar was witnessed being thrown by United Airlines baggage handlers in Chicago .
I discovered later that the $ 3500 guitar was severely damaged .
They did n't deny the experience occurred but for nine months the various people I communicated with put the responsibility for dealing with the damage on everyone other than themselves and finally said they would do nothing to compensate me for my loss .
So I promised the last person to finally say no to compensation ( Ms. Irlweg ) that I would write and produce three songs about my experience with United Airlines and make videos for each to be viewed online by anyone in the world .
United Breaks Guitars is the first of those songs .

Arsène Wenger believes that the idea of a European super league could become a reality in 10 years ' time as the Arsenal manager suggested that the continent 's leading clubs could not be sated by the Champions League .
The Frenchman has nothing against Europe 's elite competition in its current format but , on the eve of the first leg of his team 's final - round qualifying tie for the group phase against Celtic here , he predicted a time when a potentially more exclusive trophy could be on offer .
" I see more a European league developing over time rather than one team going out of the country , " said Wenger , when he was asked whether he could envisage Celtic or Rangers joining the Premier League .
" The national leagues will survive but maybe in 10 years , you will have a European league .
" I 'm not sure 100 % that I 'm right but I feel inside our game there are some voices behind the scenes coming up to do something about that , especially if the rules become too restrictive for these clubs . "
The worry for Wenger would be if the European league were to be created by an elite cartel or , to use his term , a " franchise " , breaking away to divvy up the wealth rather than it being constructed on a system of merit , involving promotions from the various national leagues .
" Personally , I believe only in sporting merit , " he said .
" So , if such a league is created , it has to be by transfers up and down , although that is practically very difficult to resolve and we do not want to kill the national leagues .
Teams would have to play in both the European league in midweek and the national league at the weekend .
It means all these teams have two teams .
" The way we are going financially is that even the money that will be coming in from the Champions League will not be enough for some clubs because they spend too much money .
The income is basically owned by Uefa and they distribute the money to the clubs . "
Wenger said that Theo Walcott had broken down in training yesterday morning and had been sent for a scan on his lower back problem instead of travelling to Glasgow with his team - mates .
" It was not positive at all , " Wenger said of the winger 's attempt to train .
" He had to stop .
The injury happened before England played Holland .
The England medical staff did n't send him back to us because they thought it would be possible for him to play . "
Walcott originally sustained the problem during Arsenal 's final pre-season friendly against Valencia in Spain .
His brief appearance represented his only run out during the build - up period because Wenger had granted him extended leave following his exertions for both Fabio Capello 's England team and Stuart Pearce 's Under - 21s .
Wenger had been fiercely opposed to the 20 - year - old playing for both international teams before the start of a long season which should culminate in a World Cup finals appearance for Walcott in South Africa next summer .
The Celtic manager , Tony Mowbray , insisted that his side have the right to be on the same pitch tonight as an Arsenal team that thumped Everton 6 - 1 at Goodison Park .
" We have some players who could give a good account of themselves at the top echelon of the Premier League , " he said .
Mowbray observed , though , that Arsenal and the others in a four - club cartel that may soon be expanded to accommodate Manchester City are in a different category from the other English clubs .
Mowbray was in charge of West Brom when they were relegated but is clear that he now has " a stronger team " .
Celtic can point to home wins , under Gordon Strachan 's management , over Manchester United in 2006 and Milan the foll0wing year .
" The players should want to challenge themselves , " said Mowbray .
" They watch the live [ Premier League ] games and they see these players .
If the boys who have never played in England have got anything about them then they should be wanting to test themselves . "
Mowbray refuses to accept the theory that Arsenal can be bullied .
" My view is that they lost too many quality players [ last season ] , " he said .
" If you lose Cesc Fábregas for four months you have lost probably one of the best footballers in the world .
When Arsenal 's best team are playing anybody in the Premier League they more than give them a game . "
A church is a place in which gentlemen who have never been to heaven brag about it to persons who will never get there .

Unlike the eight - hour charge cycles of electric cars , it takes only three minutes to refill the Mercedes B - Class F- CELL .
Unlike cars that combust hydrogen , it emits only water .
Even better — it'll reach the U.S. next year .
But do n't get too excited .
Like other hydrogen fuel cell vehicles , availability will likely be extremely limited and be restricted to regions with the greatest number of hydrogen filling stations .
It 's also reasonable to assume that , due to the high cost of the technology , the B - Class F - CELL will only be available on very limited leases .
The Press Release Follows :
Mercedes - Benz is launching its first series - produced fuel cell car on the road : the new B‑Class F- CELL .
The environmentally friendly electric car has better a performance similar to than a 2,0 - litre petrol car and is fully suited for everyday driving .
The zero-emission drive system consumes the equivalent of 3.3 litres of diesel per 100 kilometres in the NEDC ( New European Driving Cycle ) .
Production of the B‑Class F -CELL will commence in late 2009 with a small lot .
The first of around 200 vehicles will be delivered to customers in Europe and the USA at the beginning of next year .
The new fuel cell vehicle offers everything that people expect from a Mercedes - Benz : High comfort and safety as well as no reduction in interior space and boot capacity .
Customers will not have to sacrifice any driving pleasure either , because the electric motor has a peak performance of 100 kW /136 hp and a maximum torque of 290 Nm , which is available from the first rotation .
It ensures that the B‑Class F - CELL , whose impressive dynamic handling properties are in some cases far better than those of a two - litre petrol car , gets off to an excellent start .
Despite these qualities , the zero-emission fuel cell drive consumes the equivalent of only 3.3 litres of diesel fuel per 100 kilometres ( NEDC ) .
Thanks to its great range of about 400 kilometres and short refuelling times of around three minutes , the B‑Class F - CELL ensures local zero-emission mobility even for long stretches .
" 2009 is the year in which we are establishing further milestones where sustainable mobility is concerned .
The B - Class F - CELL is taking on a pioneering role as the world 's first fuel cell powered automobile to be produced under series production conditions " , says Dr. Thomas Weber , Member of the Board of Management of Daimler AG , responsible for Group Research and Development for Mercedes - Benz Cars .
The vehicle 's technological heart is the new generation of the compact , high - performance fuel cell system , in which gaseous hydrogen reacts with atmospheric oxygen at 700 bar to generate a current for the electric motor .
The fuel cell system of the B‑Class F - CELL has a very good cold - start capability even at temperatures as low as minus 25 degrees Celsius .
The drive system was completely newly developed versus the F - CELL A - Class presented in 2004 , with Mercedes - Benz engineers achieving considerable improvements in output , torque , operating range , reliability , starting characteristics and comfort .
The B - Class F - CELL now offers driving pleasure and day - to - day suitability at Mercedes level – without local emissions .
As in hybrids with combustion engines , the fuel - cell car uses a lithium - ion battery with an output of 35 kW and a capacity of 1.4 kWh to boost power and recover braking energy .
Lithium - ion technology offers several advantages over conventional batteries , including compact dimensions , high performance , great recharge efficiency and a long service life .
The B‑Class F-CELL employs the unique sandwich floor architecture that is well - known from the A - and B - Class .
The advantage of this design is that the drive components are located in the sandwich floor , where they are protected and do n't take up much space so that the vehicle 's interior remains fully usable and a boot capacity of 416 litres is available .
The B - Class F-CELL does not need to fear comparison where equipment is concerned either .
Eye - catching features include a bonamite silver paint finish and exclusive light - alloy wheels in a 10 - spoke design .
In the interior , leather upholstery , seat heating , automatic climate control and the COMAND - system , as well as other features , continue to ensure a high level of comfort .
Same level of safety as in other Mercedes cars
No matter what the conditions , the operational reliability of the B‑Class F - CELL is of the same high level as in Mercedes vehicles with conventional combustion engines .
The B‑Class F -CELL 's integrated safety concept takes the specific characteristics of the innovative drive system into account .
The concept incorporates the expertise from the many years of experience Mercedes - Benz has had with fuel cell drives and high - voltage applications .
Mercedes engineers have tested and optimised the drive - specific components ' safety in more than 30 additional crash tests .
Network of filling stations required for car 's widespread use
With more than 100 test vehicles and a combined total of over 4.5 million kilometres of trial testing , Daimler and Mercedes - Benz have the most extensive experience with fuel cell vehicles of any manufacturer worldwide .
The B‑Class F-CELL is further testimony of this technology 's high level of development for automotive use .
However , a comprehensive network of hydrogen filling stations still has to be set up before locally zero-emission driving can become a widespread reality .
To make this possible , Daimler is cooperating with government authorities , energy utilities and oil companies in joint projects in places such as Hamburg , Stuttgart and California .
Mercedes - Benz views the development of electric cars with battery and fuel cell drives for local zero-emission driving as a means of supplementing vehicles with high - tech internal combustion engines .
Advanced diesel and petrol engines will remain important for automotive applications for a long time to come - not only for individual mobility in passenger cars - especially over long distances - but , more importantly , for freight transport in trucks .
Electric vehicles , on the other hand , will increasingly be used in urban transport .

The London Hammer : An Alleged Out - of - Place Artifact ( C ) 1997-2008 , Glen J. Kuban E-mail author Paluxy Home page

Background
Evidently no photos or other reliable documentation exists to confirm the exact circumstances of the original discovery .
However , the lack of sharp marks on the nodule seems to confirm the reports that it was found loose and not chiseled from a larger rock .
Reportedly the hammer head showed little oxidation when first revealed , and that it was smooth , with a brownish " fossil " [ sic ] coating , which has since become somewhat rusted and " rough " ( Helfinstine and Roth , 1994 ) .
The hammer head is basically rectangular , with one end featuring concave bevels forming a pattern resembling a + sign ; the other end is less distinct but contains a protrusion in the center .
The handle appears to be largely unmineralized wood , although it shows some small areas of black carbonization at the ends .
Around 1983 the hammer was acquired by creationist Carl E. Baugh , an active advocate of Paluxy River " man tracks " and other alleged geologic anomalies , who began to call it the " London Artifact . "
In 1986 I was allowed to examine and photograph the hammer while Baugh displayed it at the 1986 creation conference in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , and again in 2006 after a talk by Baugh at his " Creation Evidence Museum " in Texas .
From the start Baugh and other creationists seemed to presume without clear evidence that the nodule in question was once a natural part of the nearby rocks .
They also seemed to have trouble deciding to what mainstream geologic period the nearby rocks belonged .
For years
Baugh claimed that it came from an Ordovician formation ( Baugh , 1983 , 1986 , 1987 ) , whereas Walter Lang ( 1983 ) and Bartz ( 1984 ) reported that the hammer was found in Silurian rock .
A report in Creation Ex Nihilo ( Mackay , 1983 ) stated the hammer was " in limestone dated at 300 million years old " ( which would make it Pennsylvanian ) .
A subsequent CEN article ( Mackay , 1984 ) stated that the hammer was in " Ordovician rock , supposedly some 400 million years old " ( although that age would make it Devonian , not Ordovician ) .
In yet another CEN report ( Mackay , 1985 ) stated , " the rocks associated with the hammer are supposedly some 400 - 500 million years old " ( which would include part of the lower Devonian , all of the Silurian , and most of the Ordovician Period ) .
Baugh and others ( Wilson and Baugh , 1996 ) continued to claim the rock was in Ordovician or " Ordovecian [ sic ] " rock , even after researcher John Watson , according to Helfinstine and Roth ( 1994 ) pointed out that the rock outcrops at the Red Creek site were actually Lower Cretaceous ( Hensell [ sic ] Sand Formation ) , to which they ascribed ( incorrectly ) an orthodox age " near to 135 mybp . "
On Baugh 's 2006 web site , a FAQ addressing the question " Did man and dinosaur live at the same time ? " states that the hammer was found in " Ordovician strata , " whereas the " London Artifact " essay on the same web site associates the hammer with " Cretaceous rock . "
Whatever the reasons for these inconsistencies in creationist reports , evidently the rock strata at the site are indeed Hensel Sand Member of the Travis Formation ( Lower Cretaceous , upper Aptian stage ) , considered approximately 110 - 115 million years old by conventional geologists .
Stratigraphicly the Hensel formation immediately underlies the Lower Cretaceous Glen Rose Formation , in which the Paluxy River tracks occur about 150 miles to the north .
Although Mackay ( 1984 ) suggested ( while calling the hammer Ordovician ) that the artifact is somehow associated with those who made the supposed human footprints in Glen Rose , close examination of the Paluxy evidence does not support the presence of genuine human tracks , and no rigorous evidence has been presented by any creationists linking the hammer to the nearby strata in Red Creek , let alone those in Glen Rose .
It should be noted that although Baugh has strongly promoted the hammer as a dramatic " pre-Flood " artifact , as have a few individuals writing for the Bible - Science Association and the Creation Science Foundation , other creationists organizations , including ICR and CRSQ , have said little or nothing about it in their literature , perhaps realizing its dubious nature .
Although the hammer has been kept under close guard by Baugh and thus not readily available for detailed analysis by conventional scientists , in 1985 NCSE researcher John Cole briefly reviewed Baugh 's hammer claims .
Although Cole did not challenge Baugh 's presumption at the time that the nearby rocks were Ordovician , Cole pointed out that minerals dissolved from ancient strata could harden around a recent object , stating :
The stone is real , and it looks impressive to someone unfamiliar with geological processes .
How could a modern artifact be stuck in Ordovician rock ?
The answer is that the concretion itself is not Ordovician .
Minerals in solution can harden around an intrusive object dropped in a crack or simply left on the ground if the source rock ( in this case , reportedly Ordovician ) is chemically soluble ( Cole , 1985 ) .
Analysis
In order to claim the hammer as a reliable out - of - place artifact , one would need either
1. Convincing documentation that the hammer was once naturally embedded in an ancient rock formation , or
2. Independent scientific evidence indicating a problematic age for the hammer .
So far neither has been provided .
The lack of evidence for the first condition has already been acknowledged in creationist accounts .
Independent evidence for the hammer 's age could be gleaned from a number of methods , including Carbon 14 dating on the wooden handle .
If there was no appreciable amount of C14 in it ( beyond expected residual contamination ) it would imply the hammer was more than 50,000 years old , and if younger than that , C14 could help pinpoint its actual age .
However , for years Baugh refused to allow the hammer to be C14 dated .
In an exchange of letters between creationist Walter Brown and Jim Lippard in Creation / Evolution , Brown ( 1989 ) suggested that the hammer handle has not been dated because Baugh had three " understandable " conditions for dating it : that it be done with mass spectrometry , that Baugh be present during the dating , and that someone else pay for it .
However , Lippard countered that no one has objected to the first two conditions , and that Baugh had no right to expect the third , since he 's the one making the claims , and thus the one obligated to back them up .
Even so , even after others offered to pay for the dating , Baugh declined to have it done .
As Day ( 1991 ) wrote in a follow up letter : " Far from being ' understandable , ' Baugh 's stipulations seem to be little short of evasive tactics ...
If four years have gone by and nothing has happened , I think it is safe to conclude that Baugh has no interest whatsoever in determining the truth about his marvelous hammer . "
Finally , in the late 1990's Baugh supporter David Lines reported on a web site ( Lines , 1997 , 1999 ) that carbon 14 dating had " recently " been done on a specimen from the inside of the handle , and that the results " showed inconclusive dates ranging from the present to 700 years ago . "
No information was given by Lines about when or where the dating was done , nor was any formal report referenced .
The date range also seems a little curious , since most C14 labs report a date with a plus - or - minus margin of error , rather than a wide range .
Perhaps a number of tests were done with different results , but Lines does not clarify this .
Evidently preferring a date in the thousands of years , Lines asserted that the dating results provided " graphic evidence that the handle has been contaminated by current organic substances . "
However , C14 labs have ways of minimizing modern carbon contamination , and it would not likely produce ages orders of magnitude in error .
At any rate , if the reported date range is even roughly indicative of the hammer 's age , it is more supportive of the mainstream view of the hammer than Baugh's .
After all , Baugh considers the hammer to be a " pre-Flood " relic -- presumably at least a few thousand years old .
Baugh reportedly dismissed the results as only evidence that C14 is untrustworthy .
However , even many creationists consider C14 dating reasonably accurate to several thousand years or more .
Another potentially useful exercise would be to analyze the composition of the concretion , comparing its lithology and fossil content ( both macro and micro ) with the nearby creek strata .
A shell and other shell fragments are readily visible in the nodule , and Mackay ( 1985 ) stated that the fossils in the nodule " are similar to those in the surrounding area . "
Likewise , Helfinstine and Roth ( 1994 ) suggest the lithology of the nodule is the same as the nearby rocks .
However , to my knowledge no one has positively identified the clam species , or confirmed whether they are fossil or modern forms , or made a detailed comparison of the lithology or other aspects of concretion with that of nearby rocks .
From the brief examinations I made of the object in 1986 and 2006 , my impression was that the large clam shell was probably a recent species .
One problem for hammer advocates is that careful analysis of the nodule 's composition could conclusively refute Baugh 's claim that it is an out - of - place artifact , but could not confirm it .
That is , if the nodule contained only geologically recent material , there would be no reason to consider the hammer any older .
However , as noted by Cole , if the nodule contained or was composed of ancient material , the hammer itself could still be of recent origin , since it could have been left in a place where a solution of ancient sediment collected and hardened around it .
Such limy concretions can sometimes form in decades or less , and have been found around modern objects such as World War II artifacts ( McKusick and Shinn , 1980 ) .
It 's even possible that the nodule might contain a mixture of ancient and modern sediments or organic remains , as might occur in muddy muddles and pits in a mining operation .
The early American style of the hammer , and the largely undistorted and poorly mineralized condition of the handle , further suggests a relatively recent date .
Well - preserved wood from Mesozoic or Paleozoic formations would not be expected to have such an appearance , nor to my knowledge have any similar wood specimens been documented in the nearby formation .
Lines asserts on Baugh 's web site that the hammer is partially " petrified " but I saw no evidence of this when I examined it in person , and other creationists have agreed that the wood in the handle looks relatively fresh , not much different from modern hardwood hammers ( Helfinstine and Roth , 1994 ) .
In view of these considerations ,
It seems highly unlikely that the hammer was ever a natural part of the nearby Cretaceous beds , and more likely that it was dropped or discarded by a local miner or craftsman within the last few hundred years .
It 's also possible that the nodule was brought or washed into the area from some distance away , or from a higher stratum .
Lacking any rigorous geologic evidence for their claims , hammer advocates have tried to make hay from the composition of the hammer head .
Mackay ( 1985 ) and Lang ( 1983 ) reported that the hammer was studied at the renown Batelle Laboratories in Columbus , Ohio , where the head was found to consist of 96.6 % iron , 2.6 % chlorine , and 0.74 % sulfur by weight .
Baugh suggested this profile was impossible to duplicate with modern technology under present atmospheric conditions ( Helfinstine and Roth , 1994 ) .
However , this claim would be difficult to substantiate .
Even if the composition were truly unique , it would more likely indicate a lost or abandoned technology , not evidence against mainstream geology .
According to Helfinstine and Roth ( 1994 ) a " tomographic x-ray " of the hammer , taken by Texas Utilities in 1992 , showed no inclusions or irregularities in the head .
Curiously , they and Baugh interpreted this as evidence of " advanced metallurgy " from a superior pre-Flood culture , rather than further evidence that it is a relatively modern hammer .
Mackay ( 1994 ) stated that " research continues into the unusually shiny transparent layer which surrounded the hammer when it was discovered and why it did not corrode for several months . "
However , such statements contradict other creationist comments ( Helfinstine and Roth , 1994 ) that the hammer had a brown ( and thus presumably not shiny ) surface when first broken from the concretion , and only when scratched was a shiny subsurface revealed .
Lines ( 1996 ) noted that the file cut made in the hammer head in 1934 has remained " corrosion - free " in over 60 years , and some creationists have suggested this indicates some unique or mysterious attribute .
However , as long a metal object is kept dry and clean , this would not be unexpected , and the bulk of the head already in a somewhat rusted condition would be expected to oxidize somewhat faster than the scratched mark .
In the Bible - Science Newsletter , Walter Lang ( 1983 ) stated that Batelle lab technicians " were convinced that the rock itself could not have been formed except where there was a great deal of water and pressure , " and that the " partly coalified " condition of the handle indicated to the technicians that the wood was " under pressure with water and volcanic action . "
However , one has to wonder whether these statements come from the technicians or hammer advocates themselves , since 1 .
Limy concretions are generally thought by geologists to form in calm rather than violent conditions , 2 . Very little of the hammer handle is carbonized , and such features can and normally do originate without any " volcanic " action , and 3 .
No formal report of the Batelle analysis was ever produced ( Helfinstine and Roth , 1994 ) .
Moreover , all assertions about Batelle work on the hammer appear to be suspect in view of a leaflet inserted into the February 1985 issue of Creation Ex Nihilo , which stated that all hammer research discussed in their article was privately done , and " all references to inferences that research or reports on the Hammer were done or prepared by Batelle Laboratories are in error . " ( Mackay 1985 )
Another weak attempt to counter " evolutionist " skepticism toward Baugh 's hammer claims was a comment by Mackay that " If it had been dropped under present atmospheric conditions and had to lie waiting to be buried , it would have lasted no longer than five years , after being buried . "
However , the hammer need not " lie waiting " very long before being buried ; it could have fallen into an area where it would be soon if not immediately subject to a sediment solution .
Once buried , it would be largely protected from decay in either the mainstream scenario or his own .
During a June 2006 talk at his Creation Evidence Musuem , Baugh again left the impression that the hammer was found embedded in a Cretaceous formation -- telling the audience that it was found " in Cretaceous strata " -- and again failing to clarify that the hammer and nudule combination was found loose rather than in situ .
As recently as September 2008 Baugh supporter Ian Juby encouraged the same unfounded notions on his web site , implying that it was known to be from Cretaceous rock ( Juby , 2008 ) .
Perhaps the most bizarre claim about the hammer was Baugh 's statement that " Both the wooden handle and metal shaft were completely encased in the sandstone , indicating that man was not around to make the artefact [ sic ] before the sandstone encased it . " ( Baugh , 1987 ) .
Besides contradicting other accounts that the hammer was partly exposed when found , Baugh fails to explain how the hammer could have been made in the first place if " man was not around ... before the sandstone encased it . "
Conclusions
As with all extraordinary claims , the burden of proof is on those making the claims , not on those questioning them .
Despite some creationist assertions that the hammer is a dramatic pre-Flood relic , no clear evidence linking the hammer to any ancient formation has been presented .
Moreover , the hammer 's artistic style and the condition of the handle suggest a historically recent age .
It may well have been dropped by a local worker within the last few hundred years , after which dissolved sediment hardened into a concretion around it .
Unless Baugh or others can provide rigorous evidence that the hammer was once naturally situated in a pre-Quaternary stratum , it remains merely a curiosity , not a reliable out - of - place artifact .

Who put out the hit on van Heerden ?
Ivor van Heerden is the professor at Louisiana State University 's Hurricane Center who warned the levees of New Orleans were ready to blow – months and years before Katrina did the job .
For being right , van Heerden was rewarded with … getting fired .
[ See Katrina , Four Years Later : Expert Fired Who Warned Levees Would Burst ]
But I 've been in this investigating game long enough to know that van Heerden 's job did n't die of natural causes or academic issues .
This was a hit .
Some very powerful folks wanted him disappeared and silenced – for good .
So who done it ?
Here are the facts .
Dr. van Heerden has lots of friends , mostly the people of New Orleans , those who survived and cheered his fight to save their city .
But he also has enemies , many of them , and they are powerful .
First , there is Big Oil .
More than a decade ago , van Heerden pointed the finger at oil drilling as a culprit in threatening New Orleans and the Gulf Coast with flooding .
“ Certainly he was critical of what the oil companies did to the coast , ” Louisiana engineer HJ Bosworth told me .
“ Seeing what kind of bad citizens they were .
Dozens and dozens of pipeline canals just carved the living daylights out of the coast just to find some oil . ”
Well , we need oil , do n't we ?
True , but Bosworth , who advises Levees.org , a non-profit group that birddogs hurricane safety work , explained the connection between flooding New Orleans and oil drilling quantified by van Heerden 's research .
“ Takes a million years to build ( the protective coastal marsh ) ; once you carve it up , it 's just like bleeding a wild animal , hang it up , carve some holes in it , and the juice just drains out of it .
Saltwater and tide invade .
You make [ the state ] susceptible to flooding from coastal and tidal surges . ”
Click on image to enlarge
So I was amazed to learn that , shortly after van Heerden , wetlands protector , was given the heave - ho by LSU , a group calling itself “ America 's Wetland ” gave the university a fat check for $ 300,000 .
After a little digging , I found that it was n't really “ America 's Wetland , ” the group with the oh - so - green name and love - Mother - Nature website , that provided the money .
One - hundred percent of the loot , in fact , came from Chevron Oil Corporation .
Chevron had merely “ green - washed ” the money through “ Wetlands . ”
Was this Big Oil's “ thank you ” to LSU for canning van Heerden ?
The University refuses to talk to me about van Heerden 's firing ( “ It 's a confidential personnel matter ” ) .
Bosworth notes such a grant to the University “ does n't come without strings attached . ”
And this “ Wetland ” grant appears to have some tangled threads .
LSU will monitor the coast 's environment , guided by a committee of what the school 's PR office describes as “ experts ” in coastal infrastructure and hurricane research .
But the school is pointedly excluding its own expert , van Heerden .
Instead of van Heerden , LSU announced it will rely on representatives from Chevron – and Shell Oil .
You can't challenge Shell 's expertise on coastal erosion .
The Gulf Restoration Network has calculated that the oil giant , “ has dredged 8.8 million cubic yards material while laying pipelines since 1983 causing the loss of 22,624 acres . ”
Shell too is a sponsor of “ America 's Wetland . ”
Bad Behavior
Van Heerden and his team of hurricane experts at LSU have other enemies , notably Big Oil 's little sisters : The Army Corps of Engineers and its contractors .
One internal University memo that has come to light is a complaint from the Army Corps of Engineers ' Washington office to an LSU official demanding to know why van Heerden 's “ irresponsible behavior is tolerated . ”
By van Heerden 's bad “ behavior , ” they seem to be referring to the professor 's computer model of the Gulf which predicted , years before Katrina hit , that the levees built by the Army Corp were too short .
The Army Corps , van Heerden asserts , compounded the danger to New Orleans by going shovel - crazy , with massive dredging and channel - cutting sought by shipping interests .
Following the complaint from Washington , the University took away van Heerden 's computer ( no kidding ) .
But they could n't take away his voice .
He began to speak out .
University officials do not deny they told him to shut up , to stop speaking to the press about his concerns .
They were worried , they told van Heerden , that his statements jeopardized their government funding .
Van Heerden 's revelations were , indeed , damning .
He revealed that the Bush White House knew , the night Katrina came ashore , that the levees were breaking up , but withheld this crucial information from the state 's emergency response center .
As a result , the state slowed evacuation and stranded residents were left to drown .
[ See Big Easy to Big Empty . ]
A class action lawsuit has been filed against the Army Corps of Engineers on behalf of all the people of the city who lost homes and loved ones because the Corps - designed levees had failed .
Anyone with a TV and two eyes could see that .
But the Bush Administration flat out denied it knew its system was flawed and refused any responsibility for the disaster .
Van Heerden , who had warned Washington , long before the flood , that the levees were 18 inches too short , would have been a devastating expert witness for the public .
But the university ordered him not to testify , a relief for the Corps .
( A verdict is expected soon in the non-jury case . )
The Army Corps and its contractors can feel safer now that van Heerden has been booted .
His Hurricane Center will be downsized and instead , the University will expand its “ Wetland ” program , with Chevron 's checkbook .
Joining Chevron and Shell on the LSU board of “ wetland ” experts will be the Shaw Group , a huge Army Corps contractor .
If you 've read John Perkins ' book , Confessions of an Economic Hit Man , you would know about Shaw Group , or at least the subsidiary for whom Perkins did his dirty work : an engineering outfit that used flim - flam , intimidation and fraud to turn a buck .
( I once directed a government racketeering investigation of one of their projects before Shaw bought them up .
In the 1988 case , a jury found the company was co-conspirator in a multi-billion - dollar fraud , charges the company settled with a civil payment . )
Shaw Group is also a sponsor of “ America 's Wetland . ”
So is electricity giant Entergy Corporation .
That 's the company that shut off the power in New Orleans during the flood , then sold the loose juice elsewhere , pocketing a multi-million - dollar windfall .
Yes , America 's Wetland does have a green cover , Environmental Defense , exposed in the Guardian UK in 1999 for its icky habit of licking the sugar off corporate candy canes .
We caught them trying to set up a lucrative financial operation with the very polluters they were supposed to be challenging .
[ See Fill your lungs it 's only borrowed grime ]
I spoke with the Chairman of America 's Wetland , King Milling .
Milling 's just a local good ol ' boy , a sincere guy , not a front for Big Oil .
But he naively let his group be used to buy the debate over the environment and ice out un - bought experts like van Heerden .
Flood Warning
With LSU deep in the pocket of the corporate powers and under Army Corps pressure , van Heerden did n't stand a chance .
For doing nothing more than trying to save a few thousand lives , he has paid quite a price .
As he told me this week from his home , “ No good turn goes unpunished . ”
That 's van Heerden 's fate .
But what about the city's ?
Is New Orleans ready for another Katrina ?
His answer is not comforting : “ No , definitely not .
If anything , it 's worse than when Katrina hit .
We 've lost a lot of wetlands protection .
It 's not very safe … A section of the flood wall itself has sunk about 9 inches , a result of [ Hurricane ] Gustav . ”
Is anyone listening ?
“ The [ Army ] Corps wo n't talk to me , ” says van Heerden .
“ Like everybody else , they are crossing their fingers and hoping we do n't have a storm . ”
Well , do n't say we did n't warn you .

PR & SOCIAL MEDIA : PR agency
Text 100 surveyed 449 bloggers from 21 countries concerning blogging habits and the desired ways of interaction of bloggers with PR people , and found that while the majority of the bloggers surveyed welcome contacts by PR people , the latter should treat bloggers not as journalists , but rather as influencers .
Contact with PR people
More than 90 % of the 449 bloggers surveyed welcome contact by PR people .
Most reported a high level of regular contact from PR people , with more than 96 % of bloggers in the US being contacted once a week or more ( versus 36 % in APAC and 65 % in Europe ) .
Email is the preferred form of contact , no matter which part of the globe bloggers reside .
SMS and IM , universally , are the least preferred forms .
About half of all bloggers in APAC and Europe indicated their preferred form of contact on their blogs and , as a result of this survey , a number were planning to add their preferred form of contact if they were n't already showing this .
Some 88 % of bloggers in APAC preferred an introduction before receiving information from PR people and corporations , and many of these bloggers also wanted a face - to - face meeting .
Bloggers are united in their desire for distinctive content , particularly about new product developments and reviews , feedback on content posted on their blog , and interviews with key people .
Content from PR people
Photographs are most frequently used form of supplied content , followed by charts and graphs , and video streaming .
Almost two - thirds of bloggers in APAC and Europe intend to use more elements from SMRs ( Social Media Releases ) in the coming 12 months .
Blogging habits
Bloggers in the US spend the most time blogging , with 63 % spending nine or more hours a week ; while in APAC and Europe that time spent is less ( 36 % and 44 % ) .
Microblogging is used by more than 75 % of all bloggers , and those in APAC and Europe believe they are blogging more often because of microblogging .
Continued bad habits from PRs
PR people continue to blindly send corporate press releases to bloggers .
PR professionals are failing to read the blogs and truly understand their target bloggers ' communities .
They seem to expect bloggers to post corporate material , demonstrating a lack of understanding of the medium and the very reason why bloggers blog .
They treat bloggers as they would journalists - not as influencers , which is more appropriate .
In what is believed to be the first global survey of its kind , Text 100 has examined the communications / PR preferences of chiefly technology , business and lifestyle bloggers across the globe .
The survey indicates a “ mainstreaming ” of blogging in most markets , with many bloggers reporting increased contact from PR professionals or corporate communicators .
It also highlights that some of the worst practices from media relations have been exported to global blogger relations practices .
Importantly for companies wanting to engage , the survey indicates there is significant opportunity for deeper relationships with this increasingly influential community .
Text 100 has analysed the results and suggests five key lessons for PR and communications professionals : Corporations are increasingly recognising the influence of bloggers , the increased contact points to the “ mainstreaming ” of blogging as a communications channel , and the recognition by corporations that bloggers have increasing influence over their desired audiences .
Corporate news releases are out .
Bloggers say social media releases will experience far greater usage in the coming months .
RSS feeds are a key source of information for bloggers , second only to other bloggers .
If companies are n't making their information available via RSS feeds , then they 're failing to use one of the bloggers ' most - trusted channels .
Corporate bloggers and websites are also consistently deemed more credible sources than microblogging newspapers , social bookmarking sites , television and magazines .
The majority of bloggers are still part - timers , adjust your strategies accordingly .
Outside of the US , the majority of bloggers surveyed blog for less than nine hours per week .
Most bloggers will acknowledge when a post is supported by a corporation .
More than 80 % of bloggers , no matter their region , say they would acknowledge sponsorship of blog posts .
Said Jeremy Woolf , Text 100 Global Social Media head : " This survey will hopefully dispel the myths that have sprung up and also help PR practitioners to work better with bloggers on their clients ' behalf .
Understanding that each blogger is unique is a good place to start .
From there , build a genuine relationship and develop a shared agenda .
With a platform of trust - and a commitment to playing an active role in the community - blogs can become a very successful part of a company 's communication programme . "
The lawsuit from a television producer that claims that ABC's Lost was created by him 32 years ago may sound ridiculous , but even if his claims are true , he 's still ignored what makes the show the success it is .
TMZ.com has the list of similarities between Lost and his unproduced drama ( also called Lost , he claims ) that producer Anthony Spinner filed as part of his lawsuit , and while it looks as though his 1977 pilot about the survivors of a plane crash on a tropical island has more than a few shared elements with the popular ABC show , it also raises the question about what makes
Lost the show it actually is .
I can forgive Spinner 's comparison of the similarities between the shows ' characters - although , it 's worth pointing out that none of Lost 's characters seem particularly original or even interesting when given the one - line basic description that Spinner provides , and to an extent , that always seemed kind of the point of them ; that they were stock characters we were familiar with as viewers , plunged into an unfamiliar environment - even when the comparisons border on the " One of my characters was a man , as well " line :
Survivor suffers from a drug addiction ( Kyle ) - Survivor suffers from a drug addiction ( Charlie ) ...
Ethnic minority character ( Coby ) must deal with racial slurs especially from one character ( Butch ) - Ethnic minority character ( Sayid ) must deal with racial slurs especially from one character ( Sawyer )
Advertisement
But it 's the description of plot similarities where Spinner 's comparison of the shows starts running aground .
Even supposing that Spinner 's Lost was real - and , to be honest , we 're not entirely convinced that that 's the case - the situations that he describes it sharing with ABC's
Lost seem more like situations that the latter show used as misdirection or McGuffin in order to get viewers lured in for the real story :
Raft built but destroyed by natives ...
Killing off of a lead ...
Leads attempting to kill one another , committing suicide , dying of illness ...
Use of trip - wires and makeshift weaponry ...
Use of flashbacks to the regular life of each character before being marooned as both a source of content , style , and a means of character development
Advertisement
I mean , yes , Lost did all of those things , and the flashbacks in particular were a defining gimmick of the show 's first seasons , but ... they 're not really what the show was about , you know ?
( You could even argue - if I were a more argumentative sort , I would - that the flashbacks were as much about priming the audience for narrative that takes place in more than one timeframe simultaneously so that they would n't be confused when the time travel element of the show really kicked in , as they were about character development .
But I 'll get to that in a second . )
Advertisement
All of this raises the question , in an around - about way , of what Lost is really about .
And here 's where I piss off at least half of everyone reading this by saying that , should this lawsuit come to trial , ABC should defend themselves by pointing out that , like Battlestar Galactica , Lost really is n't about the characters .
Do n't get me wrong ; both shows had characters we empathized with , believed in and rooted for - not to mention had crushes on and built fansites for - but , when it comes down to it , the characters in both shows ?
Pretty much coincidental to the important stuff .

Stephen spent some time yesterday worrying that Lost 's big finale will disappoint as many people as Galactica 's did , and that made me think about why BSG left so many people upset ( as well as why I thought it was perfect when I watched it , and felt that fall away the more I thought about it ) .
What I realized was that I only semi-agree with the idea that Lost puts character first .
Galactica showrunner Ron Moore has talked more than once about feeling lost as to how to put together the finale of the series until he realized that the show 's mythology came second to the show 's characters , and that 's why it felt satisfying at the time and less so as soon as the warm fuzzy glow faded ; yes , each character got their moment and their earned ( un ) happy ending - well , almost - but at the expense of logic and plot in many cases , and that 's what kept us watching , much more than the human drama , as good as it was : the sense that there was a bigger point to it all .
Advertisement
The same is true , I think , of Lost , but to a greater extent ; as much as characters like Ben , Locke and Desmond may stay with you , I would still rather find out the answers to all of the questions of the show 's mythology than watch any of them have happy ( or unhappy ) endings , and I doubt that I 'm that alone in that .
Lost , by design , is as much about the larger questions as it is about any of the characters ' individual journeys , and if it ends up going to Galactica route , it 'll end up upsetting fans much more than Ron Moore 's robot - montage final sequence could even have imagined .
It 's one thing for Spinner to say that he created Lost in 1977 - and , given the show 's time travel aspect , it'd be wonderfully fitting to discover that the whole thing is some ARG - esque parable about a writer who saw Lost then ended up thrown back in time and pitched the show in 1977 , knowing it would fail , so that he could file a lawsuit in 2009 - but Lost is n't really a show about characters marooned on an island after a plane crash ; it 's a show about time travel and destiny and the big questions that you can only really address successfully in science fiction that just happens to feature people whose plane crashed on an island .
Which may or may not be an island after all .
Unless Spinner can show that that 's what his show was always going to be , his Lost will , at most , be an awkward footnote in the history of our favorite island drama .

Was man mit so viel Geld alles hilfreiches machen könnte
Es wird viel davon gesprochen , wie man Missbrauchsopfern helfen kann .
Die Bundesregierung wiederholt gebetsmühlenhaft , dass die Internetsperren , die jetzt gesetzlich vorgeschrieben werden , den Opfern helfen .
Das Argument wurde vielfach widerlegt , es ist nicht mein Ansinnen , auf Gebetsmühlen mit Gebetsmühlen zu antworten .
Dennoch :
Laut Herrn Michael Rotert , Geschäftsführer der eco e.V. , kostet die Einrichtung der Internetsperren einen Eurobetrag in dreistelliger Millionenhöhe .
Sagen wir mal 100.000.000 Euro .
Wieviele Kinder hätten mit 100 Millionen Euro in den vergangenen vier Jahren gerettet werden können , indem man die Fluchtorte wie Mädchen- , Frauen - oder Männerhäuser und Opferberatungsstellen endlich auf ein tragfähiges Fundament stellt ?
Wieviel Aufklärung hätte man mit 100 Millionen Euro betreiben können ?
Diese und andere Fragen hat – zu Recht – Ralf Schwartz von der Mediaclinique gestellt .
Nach dem Willen der Bundesregierung werden diese 100 Millionen Euro von den Providern und damit am Ende von den Kunden selber bezahlt .
Die Bundesregierung verhält sich mit dem hingeschluderten Gesetz wie ein Zechpreller , der erst die Party bestellt und dann dem Lieferanten sagt „ Nö , das zahl ich nicht , ist zu teuer “ .
Und das ist das eigentlich perfide an der ganzen Sache : Die Bundesregierung zwingt den Providern eine gigantische Verpflichtung auf und weigert sich anschließend , dafür gerade zu stehen .
Das ist unfairstes Spiel auf allen Fronten .
Frau von der Leyen macht hier Wahlkampf auf Kosten aller .
PS : Einer der Gründe , warum Safe the Children in Australien gegen die Sperren sind , sind die hohen Kosten , die sie lieber in sinnvolle Dinge investiert sehen wollen .

Apple says it has seen no evidence that overheating batteries had caused screens on some of its iPhone devices to explode , blaming incidents in France on " external force . "
French authorities have opened an investigation into the safety of the cult smartphone , following claims by several users in France and elsewhere that their iPhone screens had shattered in a dangerous manner during use .
i Phone owners are fast learning that hard surfaces and glass touch screens do not mix .
" To date , there are no confirmed battery overheating incidents for iPhone 3GS and the number of reports we are investigating is in the single digits , " the firm said in a statement to AFP .
" The iPhones with broken glass that we have analysed to date show that in all cases the glass cracked due to an external force that was applied to the iPhone , " the company added .
Advent Rising sequels 2 and 3 would be created if it was up to Donald Mustard , the designer of the original Advent Rising and now the chairman of Chair Entertainment ( Shadow Complex ) .
Advent Rising was a third - person action adventure game with a strong story written by Orson Scott Card .
It was supposed to be the first game in a planned Advent Rising trilogy , but those plans were dashed when the game bombed .
It ’s publisher , Majesco Entertainment , was then strapped for cash and nearly went out of business after a series of its high profile games , like Advent Rising , sold terribly .
As a result , they re-focused all their energy on creating portable and casual games .
This lead to a huge turnaround for the company with big successes like Cooking Mama , but spelled the end for the proposed Advent series ( which also had a PSP game called Advent Shadow in the works , but it too never saw the light of day ) .
There has been some speculation online that the Advent series may be returning , but Donald Mustard put that speculation to rest in a post on the official Chair Entertainment web - site , where he addressed the rumors .
“ First , I ’d like to confirm that our next project is NOT the second installment of the Advent trilogy or anything related to Advent .
We are currently working on a completely new franchise , which you ’ll hear more about later .
Second , although our Core Design Team is comprised of several key members of the Advent team , we currently do not own the rights to the franchise ( Majesco owns the IP ) so we do n’t have the ability to continue the series at this time .
Lastly , I love Advent .
We all LOVE Advent .
It was designed as a trilogy and it ’s an incredible story .
I will always remain committed to the franchise and would be happy to finish the series if the opportunity presented itself .
For now , we ’ve got much bigger things in store for you .
We ’re moving in a new and very exciting direction , a direction that we control .
We ’ll keep you as up - to - date as possible and hope you ’ll continue to always let us know your thoughts . ”
– Donald Mustard
It was very disheartening to see how Advent Rising performed and to see the poor reviews it received .
I was really excited about the game before it came out .
But stayed away due to its critical reception and low review scores .
Some day I ’ll probably buy it and check it out though .
If you want to play the game , you can download Advent Rising on Steam for $ 10 .
Here is a trailer for Advent Rising .
While it still looks cool , it is amazing how 3D games age .
Back then these graphics were absolutely jaw - dropping .
I remember being floored and showing this trailer to everyone I knew .

With all due respect to SEO Specialists out there , I think blog commenting sucks .
Period .
I used to utilise this link and traffic building method , but not anymore .
Why ?
Because my friend recommended I read Roofing SEO – Shibga Media Roofing SEO Marketing [ 2018 ] for SEO tips .
Through it I found the best SEO company Perth experts alike with comments that successfully avoid my Akismet spam scanning , but contains , umm , useless and , sometimes , tasteless comments ( How “ Here are some dating tips for geeks , Web Optimisation Brisbane has more interesting information about it ” comment in my articles about web hosting sounds ? )
I know there is a hint of “ geekiness ” in each of us webmasters and web developers – But , c’mon …
To worsen things , I have dozen of blogs , receiving dozens of comments ( statistically , about 50 % of them are spams – both blatant and subtle . )
I reviewed the website of a SEO Agency and I conclude that all the blog commenting for SEO and link building purposes are done for two purpose : traffic building ( by trying to be among the firsts to comment on an authoritative blog post ) and link building ( especially on dofollow blogs . )

Abusing CommentLuv and similar WP Plugins
Blog commenting on WordPress blogs , especially on those that use CommentLuv and similar plugins , is sucks , as well .
It ’s like slapping Andy Beard ’s campaign of dofollowing blog comments .
His campaign promotes quality commenting with genuine intention to offer opinions first , and link / traffic building second .
Abusing Top Commentator and similar WP Plugins
I used to utilise “ Top Commentator ” WordPress plugins on top blogs in order to get my links on the Top 5 position , sitewide – With dofollow attribute .
I suck and those who do just that suck , too .
Luckily , the Top Commentator plugin developer updates it regularly , so that it gives blog owners a power to customise the listing of top commentators , including the addition of every website owner ’s life - saver vs. “ malicious ” blog commenters : nofollow tagging .
Abusing RSS subscription to be the first to know when your “ target ” blogs are posting articles
RSS readers and alerts are cool , but some use them to be the first commentator on the blog posts ( a spoiler :
This works wonder for me – Free , residual traffic to your blog , even weeks after the post date . )
But you are not supposedly to do this by posting spam or junk comments !
How for us to avoid “ suckiness ” from artificial blog commentators
Learning from my own experience , I stop doing blog commenting for the sake of SEO / link building .
Today , I comment on blogs because I enjoy the blog posts and want to tell the world what I think of the blog post .
I only use small biz seo when I need help or some advice once in a while .
I do still think about traffic and link building , but those fall deep , deep down in my SEO campaign checklist .
I want people to pay a visit and link to my website / blog from the useful comments I write on other blogs .
It ’s probably the whitest hat SEO ever , but I enjoy and feel right doing it ( just like the blog owners who do carbon offsetting to support a greener , environmentally friendly blogging practice . )

Useful TRUTH
The Ultimate Truth and Answer to Everything is 42 ?
Added by GordonAten on Jun 18 , 2009 | Visited by 5127 | Voted by 73 persons
Reading on the Truthsquare the two interesting truths about " Angels and Demons " movie and about the devastating consequences of global warming , have provoked some strange thoughts in my head , and I 'd like to test their truthfulness .
In the fascinatingly excellent movie " The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy " the super computer was asked what is the ultimate answer to everything , so it thinks 7.5 million years and then finally answers that the ultimate answer to the universe and to everything is ... 42 .
After all that tough and long thinking the computer breaks .
I do not have 7 millions of years to find the answer , neither do you .
We need an answer to the questions of our lifetime now : what is it , why is it , and what shall we do with it ?
In this context 42 has its rightful meaning in the sense that 42 seems to be the Rubicon of our lives , its middle top : until that age one collects , absorbs and learns , while after that age we are expected to give , teach and help .
I wonder what would Charles Darwin reply to this question ?
Especially taking into account the catastrophic consequences of human activity like climate change , wars , depletion of natural resources , enormous production of waste as a result of rapidly growing civilization , which it cannot process .
Why would monkeys turn into human beings so that those human beings would destroy the habitat not only of the same monkeys ?
Maybe explaining evolution from materialistic point of view was easy for Darwin at that time .
But from the point of view of logic and taking into account the amount of knowledge the humanity possesses nowadays , the Darwinist model seems to be quite misleading .
First of all , Mother Nature is perfect through its genial simplicity .
Everything has its simple role and Purpose .
So , even if we assume that some kind of lightning and fire produced the first protein , which developed into some sort of mono - cell organism , then that should have been the end of story , because that bacteria should have consumed itself .
There might have been a lot of other fires with lightnings for the mono - cell protein to evolve into a fish , then into a crocodile , then into a crocodile with hands , who got onto land , then stand up and so on .
But it had no Purpose , if this had been the right explanation to life .
Secondly , Mother Nature is genial through its Beauty , proportions and right and logic geometry .
Even millions of years of lightning and fires and " accidental mutations in chromosomes " would never truly explain the genial Beauty of the World .
Because , again , the evolution would have selected the simple forms for simple purpose of eating for survival .
Nothing more .
( In this case we should have probably been some octopus like creatures with many arms and mouthes , no skeletons , and eyes all over around to better see the prey . )
Thirdly , Mother Nature evolves on antipodes : male and female beginnings .
From the point of view of evolution , this is an unnecessary complexity , whereas Hermaphrodism is a far simpler and reliable solution .
Fourthly , the revolutionary development of material science lately is unexpectedly raising much more questions about the exclusively materialist theory of this world , than Charles Darwin and other convinced materialists even recently would have foreseen .
Scientists are unable to explain many archaeological and historical findings .
( Until now no one knows for sure how pyramids have been built !
Or what was really first : chicken or egg ? )
But the most important in our context are the huge " missing link " in the evolution from primates to homo sapiens , and where comes the light of conscience from .
Last , but not least , if according to Darwin theory the homo sapiens is the evolutionary peak and perfection , then why we kill each other , why we destroy our habitat ?
Why we actively can use only about 15 % of our brain capacity ( some more , some - less ) , and evolution did n't help us overcome this " imperfect " limitation ?
( Probably we will be able to use the brain 's full capacity when we will become able to manage its full power and not ultimately annihilate ourselves ! )
Frankly , I do n't know the Truth .
I guess , we are simply not the top of the evolutionary pyramid , and there is something or someone over us .
A creative universal cosmic force , unknown to us , or extraterrestrials , or , simply , God .
Obviously , I 'd like to know it , and I keep " digging " .
But let it remain a big Mystery - that 's another Beauty of Life .
However , I definitely agree with the 7.5 million years answer to everything : IT IS 42 !
It is 42 things for everyone : values , words , meanings , principles , years , and so on .
It would be good if such values as God , love , peace , compassion , help and so on , would become a common denominator for all .
And when these 42 true meanings will coincide for all people , then the ultimate Truth will be discovered .
All press is … good press ?
What happens when the largest coffee chain in the world decides to open up a “ neighborhood cafe ” just down the street , under a new , non-corporate sounding name , after having spent a number of hours taking notes , and making observations in your cafe and cafes like it , well , while rumors are flying , we are yet to see .
The question I have been hearing most is : “ Are n’t you angry ? ” and my response has been , “ No , I am curious . ” I am so interested to see what they will come up with .
So far , this past week , we have been able to show the world ( on local news , on Channel Four , national cable news , CNN , in the print media , The Seattle Times , The Chicago Tribune , in the blogosphere , and on the radio ( Dan was interviewed on the BBC ! ) , what makes us successful ( in our own little way , in our neighborhoods ) , different , and essentially unlike a large , top - down corporate structure ( passion about our coffees , where they grow , how they are sourced , how they are roasted , prepared , and showcased , and involvement in our neighborhood in a bottom - up , community developed and nurtured , organic way ) .
I sincerely believe that what we do is essentially different than what they can come up with , what we do ( with passion , care , and detail ) can not be mass produced in large scale industrial roasters ( with a concern for the uniform over the unique ) .
I do n’t know , but I think that it is it true what they say : imitation is the best form of flattery .
LOS ANGELES , California -- Miss California USA Carrie Prejean " breached her contract " by keeping semi-nude photos a secret and could be stripped of her beauty queen title , according to a state pageant spokesman .
Miss California USA Carrie Prejean may lose her crown because of some semi-nude photos she appeared in .
Prejean said the photos -- taken when she was 17 and aspiring to be a Victoria 's Secret model -- were being used in a " vicious and mean - spirited " effort to silence her for " defending traditional marriage . "
The 21 - year - old Miss USA contestant has been the center of controversy since she declared her opposition to same - sex marriage in a response to a question on the pageant stage last month .
" That answer , and my commitment to stand by my beliefs , has since resulted in attacks on me and my integrity as a woman , " Prejean said in a news release dated Tuesday .
Her fate was being discussed in " closed - door meetings " Tuesday among California pageant officials , lawyers and representatives of Donald Trump , who owns the international competition , said Miss California USA spokesman Roger Neal .
" They are going over the legalities and clearly she breached her contract , " Neal said .
" When you compete for Miss California , you 're supposed to disclose whether you posed for nude or semi-nude photos because it 's grounds for disqualification .
The spokesman for Miss California USA provided CNN with a copy of the pageant contract Prejean signed last year agreeing that the discovery of semi-nude photos could mean disqualification .
" You 'll see in the agreement that she signed that she clearly violated the terms of her reign as Miss California USA , but we do n't expect a decision to be made today , " Neal said .
Do n't Miss Miss California USA to appear in conservative TV ad
One photo published Monday on a Web site -- The Dirty -- showed barely more skin than the bikini Prejean wore in the pageant 's swimsuit competition .
While she appears topless , she was turned away from the camera with her arm covering most of her breast .
The Web site said it had " exclusive images , " suggesting there were more to be published .
" The reports say that there are more photos to come , " Neal said .
" We 'll see what happens with those and we want to know who 's releasing them . "
Shanna Moakler , the co-executive director of the Miss California USA organization , will meet with Tami Farrel , the runner - up for the title , " to discuss the possible next steps . "
In the news release Prejean -- who finished as runner - up in the Miss USA pageant -- defended the photos , which she said were taken when she was a teenager .
" I am a Christian , and I am a model , " she said .
" Models pose for pictures , including lingerie and swimwear photos . "
She said the photos " have been released surreptitiously to a tabloid Web site that openly mocks me for my Christian faith . "
" I am not perfect , and I will never claim to be , " she said .
" But these attacks on me and others who speak in defense of traditional marriage are intolerant and offensive .
While we may not agree on every issue , we should show respect for others ' opinions and not try to silence them through vicious and mean - spirited attacks . "
Her publicist , Melany Ethridge , confirmed a comment she gave to celebrity Web site TMZ in which she said Prejean was just 17 when she posed for the photos , hoping they would land her a job model for the Victoria 's Secret lingerie line .
" In her naivete , an agent convinced her to pose for this photo to submit to a lingerie company , claiming they could make her the next Victoria 's Secret model , " Ethridge told TMZ .
" She has since learned what a lie that was , and what a mistake it was to have the photo taken . "
Prejean announced last week that she would star in a new $ 1.5 million ad campaign supporting what she called " opposite marriage " ( marriage between a man and a woman ) funded by the National Organization for Marriage .
" Marriage is good , " Prejean said at a news conference announcing the ad campaign .
" There is something special about unions of husband and wife .
Unless we bring men and women together , children will not have mothers and fathers . "

Meghan McCain has the following to say to hate monger Michelle Malkin :
Barack Obama won the last election on the slogan “ Yes We Can , ” and
there is no reason why Republicans ca n’t go forth and win elections
with equally positive messages .
We will not get anywhere by continuing
to sell hate and fear .
Of course , there is always going to be a
fraction of the GOP that is going to respond to that , but at some point
we have to start facing the reality that hate and fear will only get us
so far .
Those emotions are not sources for inspiration of joining
anything , let alone supporting a political party .

The problem is , if conservatives wants to be relevant in the near future , people like Meghan McCain will eventually have to leave the GOP , join the Democrats , or start a new party .
The power people like Michelle Malkin , Sean Hannity , Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh wield is too great , and moderates like herself will be drowned out .
Being nasty gets enough votes to keep the Republican Party relevant , but nowhere near enough to take power .
It will take years before the party sorts itself out and consigns the names above to the rubbish heap of history , and sane people like McCain may not have the patience to ride it out .
A lot of people seem to believe that although the market economy is a swell system , it requires the equivalent of a Soviet commissar to be in charge of money and interest rates .
This belief is altogether misplaced .
The Federal Reserve System , or simply " the Fed , " is both harmful and unnecessary .
Since the Fed was created in 1913 the dollar has lost at least 95 percent of its value .
If the much - maligned gold standard had produced such a result we ’d never hear the end of it , but in our system the Fed is , for whatever reason , curiously exempt from criticism .
Under the Fed , therefore , people have lost an option they once had : accumulating savings in cash .
Under a commodity standard , people could save for the future simply by accumulating precious - metal coins — which , back when they functioned as money , held or even increased their value .
No one has that option any longer .
In other words , only a fool would try to save by piling up dollar bills .
Instead , everyone is forced to become a speculator , and to invest in securities markets they know little about and that can wipe them out entirely if times turn bad .
As early as the eighteenth century , Richard Cantillon identified distribution effects as another way inflation harmed the general public .
The newly created money is injected at particular points .
Whoever receives it first — that is , people who happen to be politically well connected — get to spend it before prices have commensurately risen , and these fortunate few thereby receive a windfall .
By the time it trickles through to ordinary people , on the other hand , the general public has in the meantime been forced to pay the higher prices to which the new money gives rise .
$ 22 $ 19
Private and public debt have exploded under this system , especially since the collapse of Bretton Woods in 1971 .
No one has a right to be surprised when indebtedness skyrockets under a system in which credit can be created out of thin air .
The very existence of the central bank institutionalizes the problem of moral hazard .
Moral hazard involves an actor ’s willingness to behave with an artificially elevated level of risk tolerance because he believes any losses he incurs will be borne by someone else .
Since there is no physical limitation on paper money creation , market actors know the paper money producer can bail them out if things go terribly wrong .
They have been vindicated in this belief time and again .
They will , therefore , be more reckless in their investment activity and speculation than they would in the absence of such a system .
We were once told that boom - bust business cycles were a thing of the past because , thanks to the Fed , we now had scientific management of the money supply .
If anyone believes that today , I ’d like to meet him .
Artificially low interest rates courtesy of the Fed do not yield us a utopia of sunshine and kittens .
To the contrary , they artificially stimulate capital - goods production and long - term investment .
They thereby deform the structure of production into a configuration that the public ’s freely expressed pattern of saving and consumption will be unable to sustain .
When this phony boom inevitably collapses , it is " capitalism " that takes the blame — when in fact the Fed , a non-market institution , is the culprit .
I am interested in neither the saccharine promises nor the technical details of the alleged superiority of a monopoly fiat - money system .
The Fed is the lifeblood of the empire , the great enabler of the perversion of the original American republic into the world ’s largest and most powerful government .
Even if the central bank did confer a net economic benefit , a contention the great Austrian economists F.A. Hayek and Ludwig von Mises strenuously denied ( and indeed Hayek won the Nobel Prize in the process of denying ) , the alleged benefit could not possibly be worth the destruction of the American soul .
As it turns out , we do n’t have to make that choice .
When it comes to the Fed , justice , economic prosperity , and the values of the original American republic are joined together .
The Fed , its academic apologists , and the drones in our supposedly free press who demonize all dissent from the monetary status quo , have done our economy enough damage .
For the sake of American freedom and prosperity , it is long past time that , in the spirit of Andrew Jackson , we killed the monster .
This is the opening statement I delivered in a debate last weekend at FreedomFest in Las Vegas on the topic " Fed Up with the Fed : Is It Time to Abolish ? " Gene Epstein of Barron ’s and I debated Warren Coats and John Fund .
The debate will be televised on C - SPAN at some point in the future .
I ’ll post the date and time on the LRC blog and at my website as soon as it ’s announced .

Legalized pot a tough sell in governor 's race GOVERNOR'S RACE
Legalizing marijuana in California could generate $ 1.4 billion a year for the cash - starved state treasury , according to the state Board of Equalization .
It 's supported by 56 percent of the public , according to a Field Poll in April .
But it 's not a proposal that any of the five leading candidates for governor is willing to embrace .
" If the whole society starts getting stoned , we 're going to be even less competitive , " Democratic Attorney General Jerry Brown - who as governor signed a 1975 law reducing possession of small amounts of pot to a $ 100 misdemeanor - said on a recent radio show .
" Like electing Jerry Brown as governor , the idea of legalizing drugs is one more bad idea from a bygone era , " said Jarrod Agen , spokesman for Republican gubernatorial candidate Steve Poizner , the state insurance commissioner .
San Francisco Mayor Gavin
Newsom says the state needs " a new direction in drug policy , " but opposes legalizing marijuana - though he welcomes an " open dialogue " on the subject as he seeks the Democratic nomination .
Ammiano's bill
The candidates ' views pose one more obstacle for Assemblyman Tom Ammiano , D - San Francisco , who has acknowledged that his bill to legalize and tax marijuana , AB390 , is a long - term project .
Ammiano has yet to enlist any legislative co-sponsors .
Winning majority votes appears to be a distant goal , despite Democratic control of both the Assembly and state Senate .
Persuading a governor to sign the bill wo n't be easy , and at the end of the gantlet , federal law still prohibits marijuana possession , cultivation and distribution .
At least people are talking about the subject , said Ammiano spokesman Quintin Mecke .
" The deeper the economic hole becomes for California , the further the conversation will progress , " he said .
The debate could also shift to the ballot box , as legalization advocates hope to sidestep the Legislature and put an initiative before the voters next year , when they will also be choosing the next governor .
California has been a leader in liberalizing marijuana laws .
The state was one of the first to end felony penalties for possession 34 years ago , and became the first , in a 1996 ballot initiative , to legalize the medical use of marijuana .
Legalization for personal use , however , is a much tougher sell .
Police groups strongly oppose it , politicians fear being seen as soft on drug dealers , and federal law , if enforced , could make state legislation an exercise in futility .
It 's unlikely to be a major issue in the governor 's race , but it 's a revealing subject for several candidates .
Republican Tom Campbell , for example , has denounced the government 's war on drugs in past campaigns , saying the billions of dollars that go to eradication and imprisonment would be better spent on treatment .
Opponents , including Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein , whom the former South Bay congressman unsuccessfully challenged in 2000 , have attacked him as soft on drugs and a would - be legalizer .
Organized crime
Campbell , however , says he opposes legalizing marijuana because it could open the door to organized crime .
Law enforcement contacts , he said , have warned him that Mexican marijuana distributors also dominate the methamphetamine trade , and " if you legalize the one , you run the risk of creating a distribution mechanism for the other . "
Brown , a still - undeclared candidate for the office he held from 1975 to 1983 , uses 1960s lingo to take a top - cop stance .
Asked July 18 on Oakland radio station KKGN about taxing legal pot sales to help balance the state budget , Brown replied , " As far as telling everybody to - what did Timothy Leary say , ' Tune in , turn on , and drop out ' ?
- that will not be the recommendation of the attorney general . "
New revenue sources are worth considering , he said , but a stoned society means " more broken families and more angry husbands and wives .
...
We need more discipline , we need more focus , and we 're going to have to work harder . "
Newsom takes a different tone , in keeping with his need to appeal to young voters as he challenges Brown for the Democratic nomination .
The war on drugs is " an abject failure , " the mayor says , consuming " precious , limited public safety dollars " by treating nonviolent offenders the same as violent felons .
But when pressed on legalizing marijuana , spokesman Nathan Ballard said Newsom does n't think it 's a " responsible way to balance the state 's budget . "
On the Republican side , Meg Whitman , the former chief executive of eBay , said she opposes legalizing marijuana for any reason .
" We have enough challenges in our society without heading down the path of drug legalization , " she said in a statement .
Attack on opposition
Poizner turns his opposition to legalization into an attack on Brown and the " bygone era " of the '60s as well as raising taxes on marijuana or anything else .
" Only those who are smoking something think tax increases will lead to economic growth , " said Agen , Poizner 's spokesman .
One advocate of legalized pot shrugs off the candidates ' positions .
" Supporting legalization probably risks losing the support of law enforcement , " but " I think opposing it is going to turn off some younger voters , " said Dale Gieringer , California coordinator of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws .
On this issue , he said , " the public 's perceptions are always ahead of the politicians . "
A 24 - year - old woman who allegedly ran a cancer donation scam that netted her thousands of dollars and gifts from celebrities has been found dead of an apparent suicide .
Officials say Melissa Ann Rice , of Ammon , Idaho , apparently committed suicide days after a charge of grand theft by fraud was filed against her .
Her body was found Wednesday in her car .
Bonneville County Sgt. Doug Metcalf says
Rice fooled national cancer foundations into donating thousands of dollars and gifts to her by pretending to be a 15 - year - old boy with brain cancer named Jonathan Jay White .
Deputies continue to investigate the case to return donations that included a skateboard autographed by Tony Hawk and a guitar autographed by Kenny Chesney .

Experts appearing before a Senate Foreign Relations hearing on Tuesday told legislators that climate change should be treated as a grave national security threat , with retired Navy Vice Admiral Lee F. Gunn saying “ climate change poses a clear and present danger to the United States of America . ”
The hearing , entitled Climate Change and Global Security : Challenges , Threats , and Diplomatic Opportunities , was chaired by Senator John Kerry ( D ) of Massachusetts with John Lugar as the ranking minority member on the committee .
Witnesses on the hearing panel included former senator John Warner of Virginia ; Sharon Burke , vice president of the Center for a New American Security ; retired Navy Vice Admiral Dennis McGinn , a member of the Center for Naval Analysis Advisory Board ; and retired Navy Vice Admiral Lee F. Gunn , president of the American Security Project .
Framing the debate
John Warner , who co-authored last year ’s failed climate bill , urged the committee to title legislation focused on energy , national security , and diplomacy to help push through the fear and confusion in the public discourse over the climate issue :
“ All of those things are needed to pull this thing through the depth of the fear and concern that lingers on this issue now in our public .
We ’ve got to convince them , ” Warner said .
Warner launched a public speaking tour last week for a Pew Environmental Group campaign in an effort to re-frame the climate debate and help clear the fog , largely sowed by special interests intent on keeping the public in a state of doubt and confusion over climate change .
Warner then suggested that the committee take a “ central role ” in helping to craft a climate bill , characterizing the committee ’s work as the “ axle around which all other parts should rotate . ”
One principal reason for such a lead role by the Foreign Relations Committee , said Warner , is that without similar commitments to address the issue from India and China , the expectation of public support for U.S. emissions cuts will be a “ lost cause . ”
Failed states and complex threats
All members of the panel expressed concern on the complex nature of the threat climate change poses for national security .
More frequent natural disasters , drought , rising sea levels , pandemics , and resource security will stretch the military ’s ability to respond while contributing to increased instability in volatile regions around the world , likely leading to more failed states .
Sharon Burke of the Center for a New American Security points to Somalia as an early example of a failed state , disintegrating into chaos and violence in the face of climate - related stresses like severe drought and water shortages .
As a result , the U.S. military has been forced to deal with piracy , a growing threat of terrorism , humanitarian relief , and helping neighboring countries avoid a similar decline .
Retired Vice Admiral
Gunn told the committee that climate change will “ change the why – why America provides aid or goes on the attack , why we have allies or enemies .
Will change the how – dwindling water supplies will impact land operations and sea level rise threatens coastal bases . ”
And while the threats of climate change may not be “ 100 % certain , ” Gunn emphasized that “ in the military , by the time threats are 100 % clear , something bad will have already happened on the battlefield .
We ca n’t wait to act . ”
The Pentagon was directed by congress in 2008 to consider climate change in its contingency planning , a process ongoing with the current Quadrennial Defense Review .
Previous studies done for the Defense Department have considered the consequences of worst - case scenarios ( pdf ) in terms of national security , yet the issue of climate change as it relates to national security has been “ largely absent from the debate , ” said Senator Kerry , “ Today ’s hearing ’s purpose is to put it at the front and center , where it belongs . ”
With the military ’s “ public embrace ” of the threats posed by climate change , the support of the American public to take substantive action will hopefully follow .
Burke told the Committee that “ poll after poll , the military is the most trusted institution in this country . ”
While supporting the efforts of the committee , and acknowledging the need for public understanding of the climate issue for long - term success of U.S. policy , Warner cautioned that lawmakers cannot wait for public acceptance to take action , saying the time is now for Congress to lead : “ I just think that this is the time Congress has got to forcefully lead .
We ca n’t follow the public ; we ’ve got to lead it . ”

New details about the treatment of terror suspects in the wake of 9/11 contradict old assurances from former Vice President Dick Cheney that interrogators were " highly trained professionals " who well knew the boundaries of the law .
Often , they had received barely two weeks ' training and sometimes made up the rules as they went along .
The haphazard nature of the CIA 's handling of the detainees , especially in the early years of the " war on terror " , becomes clear in the internal CIA report released by the US Justice Department .
Its publication on Monday coincided with the appointment of a special prosecutor by the Attorney General , Eric Holder .
" How cold is cold ? " one officer is reported to have enquired of CIA headquarters , offering just one example of how interrogators were sometimes forced to seek guidance via email or telephone from superiors thousands of miles away in Virginia as they muddled along in the field .
" How cold is life threatening ? "
Mr Holder agreed to open the new investigation in part because of what he read in the report .
Authored in 2004 by the - then Inspector General of the CIA , it described several instances where the actions of the agency 's interrogators may have amounted to criminal abuse .
Those cases were referred to the Justice Department .
In the Bush - Cheney era , the department decided not to prosecute anyone involved .

Among those expressing dismay at Mr Holder 's decision was Mr Cheney himself who insisted again that the CIA 's interrogation efforts " saved lives and prevented terrorist attacks " .
He went on to say that the hiring of a prosecutor served as a reminder " if any were needed , of why so many Americans have doubts about this administration 's ability to be responsible for our nation 's security " .
The report reveals how the CIA , which had no previous experience of so broad an interrogation programme , was sending people out into the field whose only relevant prior experience was debriefing , which by definition means getting information from people who willingly participate .
Tellingly , it describes how some of those assigned to these missions foresaw even then that there might be trouble for them if what they were doing were ever to leak into the public arena .
" Ten years from now we 're going to be sorry we 're doing this ( but ) it has to be done , " one unidentified CIA officer was quoted as saying .
While parts of the report had been amply trailed , some passages nonetheless elicited fresh shock .
One section describes a CIA interrogator telling Abd al - Rahim al Nashiri , charged with the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole , that if he did not play ball , " we could get your mother in here " .
This , the report says , would have been understood as a threat to sexually abuse them .
On another occasion , another high - level detainee , Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , the 9/11 mastermind , was told directly that the CIA would " kill your children " if any other attacks were perpetrated against the US .
While the CIA 's interrogation 's programme had a role in foiling potential new attacks , the report says there was no telling whether the harsh tactics used actually helped .
Measuring the success of such interrogation is " a more subjective process and not without some concern , " it said .

Yesterday , the UN human rights chief said there should be no immunity .
" I hope there is a swift examination of the various allegations ... and if they are verified , that the next steps will involve accountability for anyone who has violated the law , " Navi Pillay said .
The appointment of John Durham as special prosecutor has already sparked a political firestorm in Washington that may rage for months , possibly creating a dangerous distraction for Mr Obama as he tries to revive his faltering healthcare reform package .
It also adds considerable to the miseries of an already - battered CIA .
Its director Leon Panetta finds himself trying to maintain morale while also separating himself from what happened under the Bush - Cheney watch .
In an email to worried staff he said his " primary interest ... is to stand up for those officers who did what their country asked and who followed the legal guidance they were given . "
Torture details : ' We 're going to kill your children '
* " According to the interrogator the [ blacked out ] interrogators said to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed that if anything else happens in the United States ' we 're going to kill your children ' . "
* " The debriefer entered the cell where Al - Nashiri sat shackled and racked the handgun once or twice close to Al - Nashiri 's head .
On what was probably the same day , the debriefer ... revved the drill while the detainee stood naked and hooded . "
* " During another incident [ blacked out ] the same headquarters debriefer , according to a [ blacked out ] who was present , threatened Al - Nashiri by saying that if he did not talk , 'we could get your mother in here , ' and , 'we can bring your family in here ' ...
It was widely believed in Middle East circles that [ blacked out ] interrogation techniques involves sexually abusing female relatives in front of the detainee . "
* One officer expressed concern that one day officers would wind up on a ' wanted list ' to appear before a war crimes court due to [ their ] activities .

LAist had the honor of speaking with Cheech & Chong about their reunion , their break up , Tommy 's arrests , Cheech 's wedding which took place on Saturday ( Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa officiated ) , legalization of marijuana and the moon .
Yes the moon , they go out there , man .
Tonight at 8 p.m. , you can find Cheech & Chong honored in part two of VH - 1's “ Lords of the Revolution ” a five - night documentary series celebrating the counterculture icons of the ‘ 60s and ‘ 70s .
The series , hosted by Richard Belzer will pay homage to " Lords of the Revolution " like Muhammad Ali ( last night 's episode ) , The Black Panthers ( Wednesday night ) , Timothy Leary ( Thursday night ) and Andy Warhol ( Friday night ) .
The comedy duo of Cheech & Chong rose to fame in the 1970s and 80s through their stand - up act , comedy albums and films .
Their first film , Up in Smoke , released in 1978 remains a cult classic and is considered to be one of the first movies in the " Stoner film " genre .
The duo split up in 1985 , with both pursuing successful solo careers .
On July 30 , 2008 , the two reunited for the first time publicly at The Troubadour to announce their fall comedy tour , " Cheech and Chong Light Up America / Canada . "
LA has a diverse cast of characters .
Whether it's the characters with stirring stories or interesting occupations or the people who are just simply characters , this town has them all .
In an effort to get to know some of those characters a little better , we 've created " Seven Questions with ... "
If you have a suggestion for a future Seven Questions subject send us an email .
1 ) What does it feel like to be considered " Lords of the Revolution ? "
Cheech Marin :
It feels noble .
I 'm a lord .
I like for people to kneel down to me .
Did you ever think you guys would be in the same company as Andy Warhol , Muhammad Ali and the Black Panthers ?
Cheech : ( laughing )
Yeah we did , actually .
Tommy Chong : I realized I smoked with all of the people who are in this series .
I mean they were n't with me , but I smoked with them .
Cheech :
It 's funny the reaction we 're getting to " Lords of the Revolution . "
You hear the media say , ' surprisingly Cheech and Chong are included in this group . '
It 's always surprising to the mainstream media elite , they do n't fully understand our popularity , which is immense .
It 's been going on for generations , it cuts across all socioeconomic , age , gender and racial lines .
And we 're finally getting recognition for that .
2 ) Back when you guys broke up in 1985 , did you think it would take as long as it did to reunite ?
Did you think there was a chance that you guys would never get back together ?
Cheech : I was concerned that it might never happen .
But in the back of the mind , I always knew we'd do something together .
Chong : Cheech always says that we were joined at the hip , but really we were joined at the lips .
We had the same words and the same thoughts .
Cheech :
We were always trying to find something to do together but something would happen or the timing would n't be right and it would fall apart .
There 's a scene in The Corsican Brothers where Cheech and I burn down the house and then we try to get our way back home .
I go one way .
He goes the other way .
We end up meeting 20 years later .
That 's what really happened to us in our careers .
Cheech went one way and I went the other way .
We ended up together .
The Corsican Brothers trailer
It was ironic that it was almost a Disney movie that brought you guys together , Lion King .
Chong :
Yeah they wanted me to do that with Cheech but I turned it down .
I did n't want to be a sellout .
Cheech : I could n't wait to be a sellout .
Chong :
We always had that divide and conquer attitude though .
Cheech always had a crowd that would follow him to the depths of hell and I had the same thing .
So we went on tour and they all met together .
It made for quite the meeting of slackers and doers .
3 ) In an interview you guys did with the Indianapolis Star last year , you said that money was a big reason why you guys got back together .
Did the fact that reuniting was sort of a business decision for you guys affect your creative chemistry ?
Chong : Everything has to do with money .
Cheech has divorces he 's got to pay for .
My jail time , you know .
It was all about finances .
It was nice to be able to put together this big tour after 30 years .
I was flabbergasted by that .
We 're like farmers who forgot we had a crop growing in the back forty .
You mean people want to buy this , they want to pay money for this thing we forgot we had ?
Cheech : I think the fact that money brought us together actually had a positive effect on us .
Very positive .
Chong :
It was nice to cash big checks again .
Right , who does n't love that ?
Cheech :
Most of all though , we enjoy working together .
We enjoy doing this .
We never lost the chemistry .
It was n't hard at all to get back to work together .
The chemistry never left .
What 's been the highlight so far for the newly reunited Cheech & Chong ?
Cheech : I think it 's really just how much fun we 've been having .
We 've had the chance to play some great venues , we did Radio City Music Hall for the first time .
We sold it out .
We 've gotten some great crowds .
Chong : I think the highlight for me was last Saturday when I watched Cheech get married by the mayor of Los Angeles .
To me that shows the respect that was overdue .
Cheech :
Yes , well , we always throw some great parties .
Where was the wedding held ?
Cheech : My house .
Chong :
It was held at the Cheech Estate in Malibu .
Cheech : Cheech 's Beach Estate
Chong : Cheechland
4 ) Why do you think you guys have been able to remain relevant for so long ?
What 's been the secret to maintaining longevity ?
Chong :
The secret is in the movie Up in Smoke .
It 's one of those rare movies that you see it , and then you want to see it again .
The movie 's a lot like a joint .
It takes you on a timeless journey .
We 're timeless .
We are n't driven by fads , we are a fad .
A fad that will never go away .
No matter how many bitchy reviewers would like it to go away .

5 ) Has there been any famous people , public figures , who has said they were fans that came as a shock to you ?
Chong : The Queen of the Netherlands .
Queen Beatrix .
She 'd go to our movies , whenever we put out a new one , in disguise .
She was such a Cheech & Chong fan .
You know who else would watch us all the time was Sugar Ray Leonard .
We get a lot of pro athletes .
We go to a Lakers game and we get players from both benches come over and talk to us .
We 're like a walking drug test .
6 ) Are you guys familiar with AB390 which would legalize marijuana for recreational use here in CA ?
The State says it would raise 1.4 billion .
Chong :
Well that sounds good .
Cheech :
It would do those numbers overnight .
Cheech : I think that 's a very modest estimate .
Do you think the culture we live in today or the economy will play a larger role in getting marijuana legalized ?
Cheech : I think both will play in a part in it but really the economic benefits are what will make it happen quicker .
Chong :
Yeah I think both are important but we also can't ignore the medical community as well .
We 're finding more and more legitimate medical uses .
It 's been proven to be effective in diseases like Parkinson 's and MS .
They can't hide from that anymore .
The only casualty of legalization will be the DEA .
They wo n't be able to take people 's belongings because they grew some pot in their basement .
Other than though , legalization is going to have a great deal of positive effects .
Speaking of having your things taken , Tommy were you ever able to get back your DVDs ?
Chong : No .
The government keeps everything .
They destroy everything .
The movie was a big hit , it was shown on one of the cable networks and was big with the critics .
You became a target of the government .
Did that ever make you paranoid ?
Chong :
The trouble with potheads is we never get paranoid until it 's way too late .
I was three months into my sentence when I woke up and thought ' Oh man , I should n't have put my face on that bong . '
That 's why there 's so many drug offenders in jail .
We do n't get paranoid because we do n't think we 're doing anything wrong .
There 's nothing morally wrong with what we 're doing .
We 're just taking our medicine like good people do .
Do you think that your arrests had the opposite effect of what the government had intended ?
Rather than deter things , your arrests fueled the movement .
Chong :
It really woke up a lot of people .
My arrests that is .
The government had so many irons in the fire , they probably forgot that I was on the list .
Those kind of busts never work .
They always backfire on the government .
If the government could do it all over , they probably would n't have arrested me because I have n't shut my mouth since .
7 ) What 's next for Cheech & Chong ?
Cheech :
We 're going to do a new tour .
We 'll probably do a movie .
Some of our old record bits are being animated as we speak .
Chong :
And we 're going to colonize the moon .
We 're going to get way out there .
Cheech :
Yes , it will be the first stoner haven of the universe .
* We know , there 's a lot more than seven questions here but it 's Cheech & Chong , so why not ask a few more ?
" America 's fixation with ESPN sportscaster Erin Andrews has now officially reached the creepy stage , " said Mike Bianchi in The Orlando Sentinel .
" Some sicko " actually videotaped the former University of Florida dance team member through a peephole in a hotel room door while she was undressed .
There 's no denying that Andrews is the " No. 1 sex symbol " in the sports world , but the Erin Andrews peephole video is fresh proof that the Internet is destroying the privacy of celebrities .
If you 're a member of the salivating mob searching for these clips , said Reid Cherner in USA Today , be careful .
Hackers are using links purported to lead to the Erin Andrews peephole video to spread a computer virus .
The reporter has long had a good sense of humor about her obsessed fans , but the ugly " Erin Andrews peephole video link " episode " has shown how dangerous the obsession can become " — to all concerned .
The first people to pay for this blatant invasion of privacy , said L. Steven Sieden in Examiner.com , may be the bloggers who posted Erin Andrews peephole video links .
Andrews ' legal team has essentially admitted that the footage was authentic , and promised legal action against those who put the footage online .
Good — maybe that will help get people to stop treating female reporters as sex objects , and to recognize that even celebrities have a right to privacy .
Following this abysmal appearance on The Daily Show , it appears that Elizabeth McCaughey has decided to cut and run from her position at a large medical company .
Betsy McCaughey — an outspoken proponent of the myth that Democrats ’ health care reform proposals will lead to the creation of “ death panels , ” as well as a former lieutenant governor of New York and adjunct fellow at the Hudson Institute — has stepped down from her position as a director of Cantel Medical Corp. , which bills itself as a “ leading provider of infection prevention and control products in the healthcare market . ”
From a press release :
CANTEL MEDICAL CORP .
( NYSE : CMN – News ) announced that on August 20 , 2009 it received a letter of resignation from Ms. Elizabeth McCaughey as a director of the Company .
Ms. McCaughey , who had served as a director since 2005 , stated that she was resigning to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest during the national debate over healthcare reform .
Read on ...
At this time it is n't known if McCaughey resigned voluntarily or if she was asked to step down , but one thing is for sure -- her credibility on any issue regarding health care , or reform of the industry has been destroyed .
Oh well , at least she 'll have more time to spend with her family !

( CNN ) -- South Carolina 's Supreme Court ruled Thursday that Gov. Mark Sanford must accept $ 700 million in federal stimulus money , ending the only formal effort by a governor to reject funding intended to jump - start an ailing economy .
Gov. Mark Sanford became the conservative face of opposition to the federal stimulus package .
The two - term Republican said he would abide by the court ruling , but called it a bad day for South Carolina and the country .
" This decision is terrible news for every taxpayer in South Carolina , and even more so for future taxpayers who will ultimately bear the responsibility of paying for this so - called ' stimulus ' without seeing any benefit from it , " he said in a statement .
Considered a potential future Republican presidential candidate , Sanford led the party 's resistance to the $ 787 billion stimulus package .
He warned the increased spending will bring an insurmountable debt burden on future generations .
Sanford initially tried to require that any stimulus money pay down the state debt , a stance rejected by the Obama administration .
Sanford had resisted taking the money even when the Republican - controlled legislature passed a budget that included the funds .
Students and education officials in South Carolina filed lawsuits demanding that the governor take the money .
Sanford tried to have those suits merged and heard in federal court .
On Monday , however , a federal judge rejected that effort , and said that the South Carolina Supreme Court must decide what to do .
In its ruling , the state 's highest court said the legislature , not Sanford , has the power to decide whether to accept the federal stimulus money .
" At this stage in the process , the Governor certainly has no discretion to make a contradictory decision on behalf of the State , " the ruling said .
" We hold the Governor must apply for the ... funds . "
Watch report on Gov. Sanford 's policy defeat »
However , the court distanced itself from any role in setting policy on the issue .
" Our decision today should not be construed as a comment on the policy differences between Governor Sanford and the General Assembly respecting the wisdom or necessity of South Carolina accepting the " money , it said .
...
" We discharge our duty to honor the rule of law , nothing more . "
The ruling was in response to lawsuits filed by two students and a school administrators ' association that sought to force the state to accept the stimulus money , some of which will go for education needs .
CNN 's Tom Cohen and Peter Hamby contributed to this report .

There are lots of rumors from blogs and leaked torrents over the web , that claim RTM has been leaked .
It ’s all Fake !
There was a confusion which is now cleared by Microsoft official , “ Its ’ not ready yet , How can it goto Manufacturers ? ” .
In actual what happened was , recently Microsoft bloggers were all excited about a build with build number 7600 ; seeing how previous builds were stuck in the 7200 range , bloggers proclaimed the leaked 7600 build as the RTM – ofcourse , without any confirmation from Microsoft .
To counter the confusion , Microsoft ’s Brandon LeBlanc cleared it up , and he specifically stated that Windows 7 has not yet hit RTM .
The original RTM estimation from Microsoft is the second half of July , so they ’ve still got more than one - two weeks to hit the milestone .
LeBlanc further stated all the important upcoming dates when it comes to Windows 7 ’s release process .
He also warns against leaked builds , stating that they might contain malware , and that you really should n’t believe everything written on the internet .
Here is a quote from WindowsTeamBlog highlighting Facts :
Windows 7 will be available in many languages from around the world .
For us to consider RTM “ done ” , it requires that all languages be completely finished .
So there is a lot of work that needs to take place for us to finalize all languages of Windows 7 .
We also need to get to a point of “ global readiness ” with our partners .
Our partners being ready for Windows 7 is extremely important to RTM .
As Steven Sinofsky mentions in this blog post in May , RTM is n’t a single point in time .
It ’s the beginning of the next “ process ” for Windows 7 .
At RTM our partners begin their final preparations for Windows 7 , including testing and building images for new PCs .
RTM is essentially the final “ stage ” of engineering for Windows 7 before it hits the market at General Availability ( GA ) .
As Steven notes , engineering continues on Windows 7 from RTM until GA on October 22nd .
Another thing to keep in mind is that when we do a specific build internally of Windows 7 we have an extensive step - by - step validation process to ensure quality .
This process takes time .
Just because a single build may have “ leaked ” it does not signal the completion of a milestone such as RTM .
As always , do n’t believe everything that you read on the Internet – except this post ;-) .
This is the first time in history that Microsoft responded to “ Leaked Rumors ” .
Earlier to this , they always were silent .

A new dish became extremely popular among some Russian bloggers lately .
Now it ’s not quite clear who was the first one who invented this mod by pinning some uncooked sausage with hard spaghetti sticks and then boiling this alltogether and getting first “ haired sausage ” ready .
Then , publishing the outcomes on Internet caused a real wave of interest from many who wanted to try making their own haired frankfurter .
As one might guess different variations emerged .
Even the black - haired ones .
It became a real hero , and seems is still not very known abroad .
Some say that this dish was known to the Eastern nations before and they even erected a monument to comemorate it , as photoed in Seoul , Korea .
And here a short video footage teaching the basics of hairy sausage cooking :
Published in the Journal of Economic Perspectives , a report released earlier this year entitled " Red Light States : Who Buys Adult Entertainment " highlights where the revenues for pornographic entertainment on the internet actually come from .
According to , internet sales are the second largest piece of the $ 12.6 billion adult entertainment industry , drawing $ 2.84 billion in 2006 .
One of the most interesting findings in the study is American subscription patterns that utilized a list of zip codes

The economic crisis is partly blamed for rising obesity rates Obesity rates in the US have surged over the last year , a report shows .
The Trust for America 's Health ( TFAH ) and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation found adult obesity rates rose in 23 of the 50 states , but fell in none .
In addition , the percentage of obese and overweight children is at or above 30 % in 30 states .
The report warns widespread obesity is fuelling rates of chronic disease , and is responsible for a large , and growing chunk of domestic healthcare costs .
Obesity is linked to a range of health problems , including heart disease , stroke and type 2 diabetes .
BODY MASS INDEX Calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by height in metres squared Normal : 18.5 - 24.9 Overweight : 25 - 29.9 Obese : Above 30
Calculate your BMI Dr Jeff Levi , TFAH executive director , said : " Our health care costs have grown along with our waist lines .
" The obesity epidemic is a big contributor to the skyrocketing health care costs in the US .
" How are we going to compete with the rest of the world if our economy and workforce are weighed down by bad health ? "
The US government has set a target of cutting obesity rates in all 50 states to 15 % by next year .
However , the report said this target was certain to be missed .
Fattest state
For the fifth year in a row , Mississippi had the highest rate of adult obesity at 32.5 % .
Three other states - West Virginia , Alabama and Tennessee - also had adult obesity rates in excess of 30 % .
In just one state - Colorado - was the adult obesity rate below 20 % .
In 1991 , no state had an adult obesity rate above 20 % , and in 1980 the national average for adult obesity was 15 % .
Mississippi also had the highest rate of obese and overweight children ( ages 10 to 17 ) at 44.4 % .
Minnesota and Utah had the lowest rate at 23.1 % .
Childhood obesity rates in the US have more than tripled since 1980 .
The report warns that the current economic crisis could exacerbate the obesity epidemic by driving up food prices , particularly for nutritious foods .
In addition , it blames increased rates of depression , anxiety and stress for fuelling unhealthy living .
A recent analysis commissioned by TFAH found that the Baby Boomer generation has a higher rate of obesity compared with previous generations .
This suggests that the percentage of obese adults aged 65 and older could soon increase significantly .

From the individual choice to stop watching a channel to the organized effort to affect a company ’s revenue stream , boycotts come in many shapes and sizes , including the following suggestion from DailyKos.com and NewsCorpse.com .
Please contact Democrats and progressive pundits and urge them to not go on the Fox News Channel .
Not only is it a wasted effort to discuss issues on Fox News , it can extremely counterproductive .
Guests on Fox News are seemingly chosen for their right leaning political views , or their ability to be dominated .
The viewers want to see the debates in which their side always wins .
They want their ideals to be reinforced and to have that feeling of power that Fox News provides when they whip a liberal into submission .
Do n’t give them that pleasure .
Do n’t give Fox News the ratings they like to taunt like a school - yard bully .
In all likelyhood , Fox News personalities will call them cowards for not wanting to sit down , face to face , with the likes of Bill O’Reilly , Sean Hannity , or Glenn Beck .
The point is , who cares ?
Show Fox
News that they simply do n’t matter anymore .
They should be irrelevant .
So , every time you see a Democrat or progressive guest on Fox News , contact them and tell them they are obligated to help ensure responsible journalism by avoiding the hate and bile that is Fox News .
By appearing on Fox News , they are doing further harm to the efforts to repair the damage inflicted by the Bill O’Reillys , Sean Hannities and Glenn Becks of the world .

U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann , R - Minn. , is no stranger to the Truth - O - Meter .
So far , her comments have decidedly bent the needle to the left and , on one occasion , set the meter on fire .
We swear we 're not trying to pick on her , but we just could n't let this latest one go .
Recently , Bachmann went on record to declare that because of ACORN 's involvement in the Census and other privacy concerns , she would only tell 2010 Census takers how many people are in her household — and nothing more .
Here 's how she explained it in a Washington Times interview ( which you can listen to here ) :
" Now ACORN has been named one of the national partners , which will be a recipient again of federal money , " Bachmann said .
" And they will be in charge of going door - to - door and collecting data from the American public .
This is very concerning because the motherload of all data information will be from the Census .
And , of course , we think of the Census as just counting how many people live in your home .
Unfortunately , the Census data has become very intricate , very personal ( with ) a lot of the questions that are asked .
" And I know for my family the only question that we will be answering is how many people are in our home .
We wo n't be answering any information beyond that , because the Constitution does n't require any information beyond that . "

IF KIM Jong - Il has an imaginative public relations office , he 'll issue a statement that setting off another nuclear weapon was due to a simple mistake as he was confused about which missile he'd registered as his second one , and it was all within the rules , but he 's sorry if anyone 's upset and it goes to show this ghastly system needs to be jolly well reformed .
This would be more plausible than the now - famous interview by the member of parliament who protested that complaints about his expenses were driven by " jealousy " because his house " looks like Balmoral " and " does me nicely , " ending with a flourish by snarling , " What right has the public to interfere in my private life ?
None . "
He was so absurdly beyond his own stereotype , if it had carried on he'd have said , " I require substantial grounds in order to carry out the annual event of hunting a farmhand and roasting him on a spit , and no do - gooder of common stock will tell me otherwise . "
But the most annoying thing when listening to these types is not their own arrogance , but that the mainstream view of modern Britain , including the idea on which New Labour was founded , is that class division belongs only in the past .
So when you go past a housing office on a council estate that 's full of disgruntled tenants , they must all be yelling , " When are you bastards gonna come and repair my duck island ?
It 's three weeks since I reported it was leaking , where are my bleeding ducks supposed to rest when they 're half way across my pond , they 're getting knackered , now sort it . "
And Job Centers will be packed with claimants crying , " I can't survive on £ 68 invalidity benefit .
Out of that I 've got to pay for council tax , heating , food , moat cleaning , I 've already got the portcullis going rusty , I 'm desperate . "
And if a single parent on housing benefit was questioned about why they had n't declared a morning 's work , they could say to the fraud officer , " Do you know what this is about ?
Jealousy .
I now own some cat food and a packet of biscuits which does me nicely , and no member of the darned public has the right to interfere , " and be allowed to carry on as normal .
The chances of someone moving a long way up or down the social scale from the one they were born into are now less than they were in the 1950s .
But , somehow , the Labour Party has come out worst from all this , partly because some of their lot has been on the fiddle as well , but mostly because they 're driven by the idea that class is no longer an issue .

They can hardly shout about thieving aristocrats when they 've spent 15 years insisting class no longer exists .
So trends taking place now , that would once have made Labour popular , such as hostility toward bankers and contempt for the duck - island owning gentry , instead help make Labour less popular than ever .
But they could still rescue the situation .
The bumbling landowning set are usually dismissed by people who insist class has disappeared , as a quaint and quirky hangover from British history , a bit of fun with no real power .
So to prove this , they should be made to open up their houses so the public and groups of children can splash in the clean moats and frolic in the grounds , taking pictures of each other merrily throwing stones at Douglas Hogg as he stomps round the lawn muttering , " Confounded bloody commoners , " reminding us of the times when class still mattered .

I ’m not even sure who got the story first , but I think it was USA Today .
67 year old Illinois native , Bill Bramanti built his future coffin in the shape of a Pabst Blue Ribbon beer can because he just really loves the beer .
Until he passes away , he ’s using the coffin as a beer cooler , but admits that he has actually gotten inside the coffin to test the size .
He even threw a party where he used the coffin to store beers for his friends .
We just hope none of his friends became mentally unstable after they found out it was his final resting place .
Anyone know what ’s going on with Bill Bramanti of South Chicago Heights ?
If he ’s still using the coffin regularly as a PBR cooler , I wonder how it ’s holding up .
Thanks , Emma !

Following up on Tuesday 's post about police checkpoints and license plate cameras , here 's a new story on speed cameras in the Washington Examiner .
D.C. police chief Cathy Lanier has publicly denounced the use of technology , such as certain iPhone applications , that alert drivers to the location of speed traps , red light cameras , and DUI checkpoints , referring to such use as a " cowardly tactic . "
This stance puts Chief Lanier at odds with 9o % of the country 's police departments .
She has previously stated that these cameras reduce traffic deaths .
This is an interesting statement , as drivers only learn of their infraction after receiving their ticket in the mail .
However , with devices that alert drivers to the location of cameras , drivers can reduce their speed prior to approaching locations the police department identified as needing additional coverage .
Therefore , by denouncing the " cowardly " use of such technology , D.C. police chief Cathy Lanier has indirectly admitted that she cares more about the revenue earned from traffic cameras than the lives they supposedly save .

A Conservative Government would make quangos more democratically accountable , David Cameron announced today as he unveiled a review of publicly - funded independent bodies to determine which should be scrapped or slimmed down .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Mr Cameron said that " in many cases " quangos were getting bigger and bigger and spending increasing amounts of money .
" There are some quangos that have a technical function , inspecting nuclear installations , or they have a transparency function , like the Office for National Statistics , but , in too many cases , these organisations have got bigger and bigger - they spend about £ 64 billion a year , " he told BBC Breakfast .
" They start having their own communications departments , their own press officers , they start making policy rather than just delivering policy and their bosses are paid vast amounts of money . "
He added that , for the top 20 quango chiefs , the average pay was about £ 658,000 .
He said : " There is a lot of money to be saved , but more to the point , we want to make these more democratically accountable , so that people do n't feel the rage and anger against the machine that they have no control over . "
Mr Cameron 's remarks were made as he announced that a Conservative government would cut the number of unelected quangos in " a massive shift in power from bureaucracy to democracy " .
Shadow Cabinet ministers have been told to review every publicly - funded independent body within their briefs to determine which should be scrapped or slimmed down .
If voted into power at the next General Election , Conservative ministers would set the rules each one operated under and be directly responsible for its performance .
Speaking to BBC Breakfast , Mr Cameron said there was scope to slim down Ofcom , the broadcasting watchdog , by a " huge amount " .
He said : " Give Ofcom , or give a new body , the technical function of handing out the licences and regulating lightly the content that is on the screens .

" But it should n't be making policy , it should n't have its own communications department , the head of Ofcom is paid almost half a million pounds .
" We could slim this body down a huge amount and save a lot of money for the taxpayer . "
Mr Cameron is expected to blame the myriad bodies for a public feeling that " nothing ever changes " and say reform is vital to tackle the crisis of confidence in politics caused by the expenses scandal .
But Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liam Byrne said at the weekend that he had also ordered a detailed review of quangos in a bid to " make sure every penny of public money goes to frontline services " .
The Tories said the move was laughable as the numbers had risen dramatically since Labour came to power in 1997 , despite a promise by Gordon Brown in opposition of a " bonfire of the quangos " .
And they rejected claims by Mr Byrne that their policy proposals included the creation of at least another 17 .
Mr Cameron will set out his proposals in a speech to the Reform think tank , which has campaigned on the issue .
He will say : " This growth in the number of quangos , and in the scope of their influence , raises important questions for our democracy and politics .
" Questions of accountability - now vital in the light of the damaged trust in our political system , questions about public spending control - now vital in the light of the debt crisis ; and questions relating to the effectiveness of politics in addressing the key social problems that give people such great concern .
" Too many state actions , services and decisions are carried out by people who cannot be voted out by the public , by organisations that feel no pressure to answer for what happens - in a way that is completely unaccountable .
" The growth of the quango state is , I believe , one of the main reasons people feel that nothing ever changes ; nothing will ever get done and that the state just passes the buck and sends them from pillar to post instead of sorting out problems . "
He will continue : " We must reduce the number of quangos in this country .
But we must do so in a way that is responsible and which recognises that there are circumstances in which quangos have a useful and important part to play in democratic politics . "
" With a Conservative Government any delegation of power by a minister to a quango will not mean a corresponding delegation of responsibility .
" Even when power is delegated to a quango , the minister remains responsible for the outcome .
They set the rules under which the quango operates .
" Right now , my Shadow Cabinet is reviewing every independent public body that exists in their department .
They are looking to see if they perform a technical , fairness or transparency function .
" At its heart is a massive shift in power from bureaucracy to democracy , unaccountability to accountability , elites to people from quangos to you . "
Reform director Andrew Haldenby said : " Quangos are the worst kind of government , existing in a ' twilight zone ' , untouchable by electors or the market .
They provide cover for unpopular decisions .
They provide a quick way to circumvent existing government structures that are n't working .
" Politicians have to be brave and jettison the quango comfort blanket . "

Cook bought four knives in one hour Trading standards officers have called for a ban on online knife sales after a machete was sold to a 15 - year - old for £ 1.50 over the internet .
The potential weapon was delivered in the mail in bubble wrap and cardboard to the teenager who was testing under - age sales for trading standards .
The tests found that 214 out of 835 stores in England and Wales sold knives illegally to under - 18s .
The problems were more acute online , where 80 % sold knives to young people .
" As knife crime remains a problem in many of our towns and cities , it beggars belief that so many traders are still prepared to sell potentially lethal weapons to children , " said Ron Gainsford , chief executive of the Trading Standards Institute ( TSI ) .
Rules
The law states that it is illegal to sell a knife or bladed article to anyone aged under 18 , with businesses and staff facing a fine of up to £ 5,000 or six months in prison for doing so .
It was too easy .
Anyone can do it , because a lot of people are used to buying things online
Test purchaser Alex Cook , 15 Home Office figures show that knives were involved in 22,151 violent offences in 2007 - 08 .
Knives have become a status symbol among some young people and the increase in searching by police officers means some young people dash into shops to buy knives for " instant arming " .
The situation appeared more problematic with sales made online , according to tests by trading standards departments in the London boroughs of Southwark , Lambeth and Greenwich , as well as Staffordshire , Salford and Cardiff .
They found that 58 out of 72 websites selling knives were prepared to sell to children aged under 18 , often because they failed to ask the buyer 's age .
Sales to teens Brandon Cook , TSI lead officer for tackling under - age sales , asked his 15 - year - old son Alex to test how easy it was to buy knives on the internet using the teenager 's debit card .
He bought four , including the machete , in one hour .
They started to be delivered within days .
" It was too easy .
Anyone can do it , because a lot of people are used to buying things online , " said Alex .
His father said that websites offering online gambling were able to put blocks on people under 18 using their sites and the same should be true of websites selling knives .
Issues around underage web - based sales of knives were raised with some major department stores which immediately withdrew them from sale online .
The British Retail Consortium also started a scheme in February that ensures retailers do not sell knives to youngsters .
Some 21 major retailers have signed up .
However , the TSI wants the government to ban the sale of knives online .
The Institute is supported by Ann Oakes - Odger , founder of KnifeCrimes.org , whose son Westley , 27 , died in 2005 when he was stabbed in the neck in an unprovoked attack at a cash machine .
" As a mother who knows the pain of losing a child , if one life was saved by a ban on the internet sale of knives , it would be worthwhile , " she said .
The industry says that work is continuing for a strategy that would allow legitimate consumers to buy age - restricted products .
" We are working towards creating an industry standard so that both online retailers and customers can be assured that we are doing everything possible to ensure that age - restricted products are sold responsibly , " said James Roper , chief executive of the Interactive Media in Retailing Group - the online retailing industry body .

We suspect this finding contributed to Sarah Palin 's decision to quit .
That said , it seems ridiculous that public officials are n't indemnified for routine legal fees pertaining to their conduct in office .
Legal costs are brutal , even when you 've done nothing wrong .
And public officials presumably often get their asses sued off .
( Are officials in other states indemnified ?
To be clear :
We do n't think this indemnity should apply if officials are convicted of crimes .
It should work the way it does in the private sector : Companies generallly pay legal fees unless executives are found to have broken the law or violated corporate policy ) .
ANCHORAGE , Alaska –
An independent investigator has found evidence that Gov. Sarah Palin may have violated ethics laws by trading on her position in seeking money for legal fees , in the latest legal distraction for the former vice presidential candidate as she prepares to leave office this week .
The report obtained by The Associated Press says Palin is securing unwarranted benefits and receiving improper gifts through the Alaska Fund Trust , set up by supporters .
An investigator for the state Personnel Board says in his July 14 report that there is probable cause to believe Palin used or attempted to use her official position for personal gain because she authorized the creation of the trust as the " official " legal defense fund .
The practical effect of the ruling on Palin will be more financial than anything else .
The report recommends that Palin refuse to accept payment from the defense fund , and that the complaint be resolved without a formal hearing before the board .
Palin posted an entry on Twitter in which she said the " matter is still pending , " a statement echoed by her lawyer .
The fund aims to help Palin pay off debts stemming from multiple ethics complaints against her , most of which have been dismissed .
Palin says she owes more than $ 500,000 in legal fees , and she cited the mounting toll of the ethics probes as one of the reasons she is leaving office .
The investigator , Thomas Daniel , sided with Palin in her frustration with having to defend herself against a barrage of ethics complaints .
He suggested that Alaska lawmakers may need to create a law that reimburses public officials for legal expenses to defend complaints that end up being unfounded .
Palin's friends and supporters created the Alaska Fund Trust in April , limiting donations to $ 150 per person .
Organizers declined to say how much it has raised , and had hoped to raise about $ 500,000 .
A Webathon last month brought in about $ 130,000 in pledges .
Kristan Cole , the fund 's trustee , said the fund has been frozen pending the personnel board 's review .
In his report , Daniel said his interpretation of the ethics act is consistent with common sense .
An ordinary citizen facing legal charges is not likely to be able to generate donations to a legal defense fund , he wrote .
" In contrast , Governor Palin is able to generate donations because of the fact that she is a public official and a public figure .
Were it not for the fact that she is governor and a national political figure , it is unlikely that many citizens would donate money to her legal defense fund . "
The ethics complaint was filed by Eagle River resident Kim Chatman shortly after the fund was created , alleging Palin was misusing her official position and accepting improper gifts .
" It 's an absolute shame that she would continue to keep the Alaska Fund Trust Web site up and running , " Chatman told the AP .
At least 19 ethics complaints have been filed against Palin , most of them after she was named the running mate for GOP presidential candidate John McCain .
Most of those have been dismissed , and Palin 's office usually sends a news release with the announcement .
The multiple ethics complaints include an investigation by state lawmakers over Palin 's firing of her public safety commissioner in the so - called Troopergate scandal .
John Coale , a Washington lawyer who helped set up the fund , called the probable cause finding " crazy , " adding that if upheld , it would mean that no governor could ever defend themselves against frivolous ethics complaints .
" If this complaint is true , there 's no way to defend yourself " as governor , Coale said .
" Anybody can keep filing ethics complaints and drive someone out of office even if you 're a nut . "
Coale said that unlike other states , Alaska 's governor has no legal counsel 's office to defend the governor from allegations brought against the governor in her official capacity .
Coale said he recommended creation of the legal defense fund , a common practice in Washington .
The Web site for the Palin fund cites similar accounts created for Hillary Clinton , John Kerry and other prominent politicians .

CHICAGO | Calls to poison - control centers about teens abusing attention - deficit drugs soared 76 percent over eight years , sobering evidence about the dangerous consequences of prescription misuse , a study shows .
The calls were from worried parents , emergency - room doctors and others seeking advice on how to deal with the problem , which can be deadly .
Four deaths were among cases evaluated in the study .
Kids taking attention - deficit ( hyperactivity ) disorder drugs to get high or increase alertness may not realize that misuse of the drugs can cause serious , sometimes life - threatening symptoms , including agitation , rapid heartbeat , extremely high blood pressure .
“ They say , ‘ It ’s FDA approved , how dangerous could it be ? ’ ” said Steve Pasierb , head of the Partnership for a Drug - Free America , based in New York .
In the study , researchers from Cincinnati Children ’s Hospital Medical Center evaluated 1998 - 2005 data from the American Association of Poison Control Centers .
During that time , nationwide calls related to teen abuse of ADHD drugs , specifically stimulants , increased from 330 to 581 yearly , and there were four deaths .
Overall , 42 percent of teens involved had moderate to severe side effects and most ended up getting emergency - room treatment .
The true number of teen abusers who have bad side effects is likely much higher , because many cases do n’t result in calls to poison - control centers , said study author Dr. Randall Bond , medical director of the hospital ’s Drug and Poison Information Center .
The surge , from 1998 to 2005 , outpaced calls for teen substance abuse generally .
It also paralleled an 86 percent rise in ADHD medicine prescriptions for youths ages 10 to 19 , from about 4 million to nearly 8 million during that time .
“ It ’s more bad news on an entrenched problem , ” Mr. Pasierb said .
His nonprofit group was not involved in the study .
Its own research suggests that about 19 percent of teens have abused prescription drugs including medicine for ADHD .
Government - sponsored surveys suggest that teen abuse of stimulants including ADHD drugs has declined in recent years .
The new study was for release Monday in the August edition of Pediatrics .
Mark Stein , a psychiatry professor and ADHD expert at University of Illinois at Chicago , said abuse typically involves crushing and snorting the pills , which speeds up the effects and can produce a buzz or sense of euphoria - along with dangerous side effects .
Children who develop serious side effects should be taken to the emergency room , where sedatives can be used to treat the problem , Mr. Stein said .
The study lacks information on whether abusers were teens with ADHD , but anecdotal evidence suggests many are not .
Mr. Stein said the study should not deter use of ADHD drugs in teens who really need them , particularly because there ’s evidence that kids with ADHD who do n’t get medication are at risk for abusing illicit drugs .

FAR out to sea , the wind blows faster than it does near the coast .
A turbine placed there would thus generate more power than its inshore or onshore cousins .
But attempts to build power plants in such places have foundered because the water is generally too deep to attach a traditional turbine 's tower to the seabed .
One way round this would be to put the turbine on a floating platform , tethered with cables to the seabed .
And that is what StatoilHydro , a Norwegian energy company , and Siemens , a German engineering firm , are doing .
In the next few days the first of their floating offshore turbines should be connected to Norway 's electricity grid .
Once that has been done , it will start a two - year test period generating about 1 megawatt of electricity — enough to supply 1,600 households .
The Hywind is the first large turbine to be deployed in water more than 30 metres deep .
The depth at prototype 's location , 10 kilometres ( six miles ) south west of Karmoy , is 220 metres .
But the turbine is designed to operate in water up to 700 metres deep , meaning it could be put anywhere in the North Sea .
Three steel cables running to the seabed prevent it from floating away .
It is an impressive sight .
Its three blades have a total span of 82 metres and , together with the tower that supports them , weigh 234 tonnes .
That makes the Hywind about the same size as a large traditional offshore turbine delivering comparable power .
The tower sits on a conical steel buoy that extends 100 metres below sea level and has a diameter of 8.3 metres at its base and 6 metres at its top .
The buoy contains 300 tonnes of concrete ballast that stops the structure toppling over by placing its centre of gravity well below the water 's surface .
That is necessary because , even though it is tethered , the motion of the sea causes the tower to sway slowly from side to side .
This swaying places stress on the structure , and that has to be compensated for by a computer system that tweaks the pitch of the rotor blades to keep them facing in the right direction as the tower rocks and rolls to the rhythm of the waves .
That both improves power production and minimises the strain on the blades and the tower .
The software which controls this process is able to learn how to do the job better by measuring the success of previous changes to the rotor angle and using that information to fine - tune future attempts to dampen wave - induced movement .
If all works well , the potential is huge .
Henrik Stiesdal of Siemens 's windpower business unit reckons the whole of Europe could be powered using offshore wind , but that competition for space near the coast will make this difficult to achieve if only inshore sites are available .
Siting turbines within view of coastlines causes conflicts with shipping , the armed forces , fishermen and conservationists .
But floating turbines moored far out to sea could avoid such problems .
As with so many things , out of sight is out of mind .
That , plus the higher wind speeds that mean that a deep - water turbine could generate four times as much power as a shallow - water one , make the sort of technology that the Hywind is pioneering an attractive idea .
One obvious drawback is that connecting deep - water turbines to the electrical grid will be expensive .
But the biggest expense — the one that will make or break far - offshore wind power — will probably be maintenance .
In deep seas , it will not be possible to use repair vessels that can jack themselves up on the seabed for stability , like the machines that repair shallow - water turbines .
Instead maintenance will only be possible in good weather .
If the Hywind turbine turns out to need frequent repairs , the cost of leaving it idle while waiting for fair weather , and of ferrying people and equipment to and fro , will outweigh the gains from generating more power .
But if all goes according to plan , and the turbine does not need such ministrations , it would put wind in the sails of far - offshore power generation .
The Odd Tale of Facebook , TipJoy , the Deal that Did n’t Happen and the Hire that Did
What ’s next for the team behind Tipjoy , a micropayments service that closed its doors this week ?
For one of the company ’s founders , it ’s a job at Facebook – the social network that offered to buy the start - up this summer , then walked away from the deal .
In fact , co-founder Ivan Kirigin ’s first day at Facebook was last Monday – four days before he and his wife , Abby , announced that they are shuttering their start - up .
Confused ?
You should be :
This is one of the odder M&A stories I ’ve seen in a while .
Not surprisingly , the tale differs depending on who ’s telling it .
Some basic , undisputed facts : Sometime this spring , TipJoy , a year old start - up that lets Web surfers “ tip ” bloggers and publishers , shopped the service to multiple parties , including Twitter and Facebook .
By July , Facebook had offered , via a term sheet , to buy the company .
Facebook then pulled its offer , and shortly after , offered Ivan a job .
Now he and his wife are shutting TipJoy down and returning what ’s left of the $ 1 million they had raised to their investors .
Also undisputed :
No one has accused anyone of violating any laws , or contracts .
Facebook ’s offer was nonbinding and nonexclusive .
And it ’s not unheard of for companies to walk away from an M&A deal late in the process .
That ’s what happened , for instance , when Google ( GOOG ) bailed out after deep talks with Digg a year ago .
You could see why some of TipJoy ’s backers , which include BetaWorks , the Accelerator Group , ex-Googler Chris Sacca and the Y Combinator start - up factory , might cry foul .
The argument would be that Facebook ’s actions effectively prevented the company from finding another buyer .
But even if that was true , it does n’t mean that Ivan Kirigin had to accept Facebook ’s job offer and / or shutter his company .
Facebook spokesman Larry
Yu declined to discuss the negotiations in detail , but offered this statement via email : “ We take pride in operating in a transparent and ethical manner .
We ca n’t offer any specifics here , but to suggest anything untoward occurred on our part simply ignores the facts . ”
I ’ve sent the Kirigins repeated requests for comment but have n’t heard back .
Their statement announcing the decision to close their company does n’t mention Ivan ’s new job .
But it does hint , obliquely , at their future plans :
When we evaluate why there ’s been so much hype about payments on Twitter , and yet so little traction for us ( and even far less for our competitors ) it is clear to us that the reason is that a 3rd party payment service does n’t add enough value .
We strongly believe that social payments will work on a social network , provided that they ’re done within the platform and not as a 3rd party ….
the only way to get around this is for the platforms themselves to control payments –then all people wanting to operate on that platform would have to play along .
We believe that a payments system directly and officially integrated into social networks such as Twitter and Facebook will be a huge success .
UPDATE : Y Combinator founder Paul Graham , commenting on this story on his Hacker News site , says Facebook hired Ivan at his urging :
Facebook did n’t do anything wrong .
Tipjoy was out of money .
They ’d been talking to several potential acquirers , including Facebook , but those deals all fell through .
So the Tipjoys were going to have to get jobs somewhere .
Since they were worried about money and Ivan admired the hackers at Facebook , I asked FB if they ’d offer him a job , and they did .
It does n’t portend anything for the future of startups , as this story seems to imply .
If your startup tanks , you have to get a job somewhere , and lots of hackers get jobs at Facebook .
There are several other YC alumni working there .
Ivan Kirigin also weighs in within the same comments section , and says that my report “ completely does n’t tell the whole story . ”
Ivan , I ’m all ears , so either drop me a line or leave a comment below .
Note : I ’m assuming that the commenters identifying themselves as Paul Graham and Ivan Kirigin in the comments section are indeed Paul Graham and Ivan Kirigin .
But I ’ve sent emails to both men so I can verify that .
Update : That is indeed Paul Graham .

The 52 fiscally conservative House Democrats known as the Blue Dogs and playing prominent roles in the nation ’s health care reform debate continue to collect campaign funds from health insurers at a greater rate than their non-Blue Dog counterparts , the Center for Responsive Politics has found .
Health and accident insurers , HMOs and health services increased their contributions to Blue Dogs by at least 15 percent between the first and second quarter of this year ( from $ 106,200 to $ 122,650 ) , but by 3 percent to non-Blue Dog House Democrats .
Blue Dogs ’ stance on health care reform is more in line with that of health insurers and pharmaceutical companies — they oppose a public health plan unless “ insurance market reforms and increased competition do n’t lower costs on their own , ” according to Politico .
( Note : As CRP continues to code contributions by industry , these numbers are likely to increase . )
In the first six months of the year , Blue Dogs have also brought in more , on average , from health insurers than both Republicans and non-Blue Dog Democrats in the House .
Blue Dog Democrats have collected $ 4,401 , on average , through their leadership PACs and candidate committees this year .
That compares to $ 3,085 to non-Blue Dog House Democrats and $ 3,820 to House Republicans .
Interestingly , nursing homes have also increased their contributions to the group of moderate Democrats , from $ 31,000 in the first quarter to $ 73,400 in the second .
That ’s a jump of 137 percent , compared to an increase of 88 percent to non-Blue Dog House Democrats and 41 percent to House Republicans .
Nursing homes also seem to prefer Blue Dogs — so far this year they ’ve given $ 2,008 , on average , to members of the coalition , compared to $ 1,133 to non-Blue Dog House Democrats and $ 533 to House Republicans .
So far , based on the total individual contributions that CRP has coded , 7 percent of all donations to the candidate committees and leadership PACs of Blue Dogs this cycle have come from employees and political action committees of the health sector .
And health professionals are the second largest donating industry to members of the coalition this cycle , giving $ 688,250 .

And you can find our earlier report on contributions to the individual Blue Dog members here .
Here ’s a list of the members of the Blue Dog Coalition and the total they ’ve received to their leadership PAC and candidate committees from the employees and PACs of various health - related industries and the health sector overall since 1989 :

Current estimates of the S&P 500’s P/E are all over the place , ranging from 16 to 134 .
Which one is right ?
Depends on your perspective .
Bulls almost always use “ operating earnings ” as the basis for their price / earnings calculations .
This method excludes losses / charges seen as “ non-recurring ” or “ one time ” .
Loan - writedowns , employee stock compensation , and many more items can be labeled as “ non-recurring ” , and thus excluded from OE .
The result is a subjective and optimistic version of true earnings .
It ’s kind of like saying , “ I made a killing in Vegas this week * .
( * excludes losses from blackjack , booze , and strippers ) ” .
Bears prefer to look at “ reported earnings ” , or those that adhere to GAAP ( Generally Accepted Accounting Practices ) .
We think it presents a more realistic picture of the bottom line .
It ’s certainly more objective , and has been the traditional way earnings are reported since the 1920s .
But in the ’90s , use of Pro-Forma accounting to create operating earnings skyrocketed .
This insightful infographic from The Chart Store speaks volumes on the issue .
The bottom - chart shows “ reported earnings ” , and goes back to 1927 .
As you can see , the use of “ operating earnings ” has caused some inflated valuations , to say the least .
Mainstream media outlets typically highlight operating earnings .
The problem arises when they say that stocks are “ historically cheap ” ?
By what measure ?
Operating earnings ?
Companies in the past did n’t exclude losses from their earning statements .
So if you use an apples - apples means of measuring , equities are extremely expensive according to historic norms ( reported earnings ) .
Please do n’t trade on this data , or anything else I post here .
As Keynes said , “ The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent ” .
I ’m not a big fan of his , but that one was spot-on .
For more info on earnings interpretation , read this Barrons piece from last year .
It concluded that reported earnings ( the more bearish of the two ) is the more fair measure .
Edited and Updated for Clarity on 7/24/09 .
No positions in any companies mentioned .
It wo n’t help you if your plane falls out of the sky and plummets 30,000 feet to the ground , but if you ’re in an emergency landing or your plane just flops off the runway on takeoff , new airplane seats could save your life .
The seats , which will have to be retro-fitted to even some old commercial airliners after October 27th this year , are called 16G seats , and can withstand up to 16 times the force of gravity before being ripped from their shorings .
Any plane introduced since 1988 already has them , but planes which were originally brought to market before that date will need them too .
It ’s a rather technical issue , to be sure , and its likely that any plane you travel in today is already so equipped .
More interesting are airplane airbags .
These will be mounted into the lap belt and work just like those in cars , exploding into a safe cushion in case of a crash .
They are calibrated not to deploy when the plane hits turbulence , though , so you should n’t have to worry about your tiny bottle of warm white wine being launched into your face .
The plebs wo n’t see the benefits , though .
These belts will be fitted into first class seats , not cattle - class .
This is n’t a way to kill off the lower castes , though , but a simple question of engineering :
There just is n’t space top fit the belts into already tight seats , and the cushion of the seat in front provides protection anyway .
The bags could make their way into seats in the emergency exit rows , the front seats and anywhere that a passenger may be flung into space .
One more reason , apart from the legroom and lack of children , to choose the exit row .
We ’re all for more safety in planes , though , which seem to have been dropping from the skies recently .

New Planes Will Have Air Bags and Seats Less Apt to Rip Loose [ NYT ]

An independent inquiry is to be held into allegations that British soldiers mutilated and murdered civilians in Iraq – and the government has been forced to admit that key documents had not been disclosed .
In a letter read out in court today , the defence secretary , Bob Ainsworth , said he " profoundly regrets " the failures to disclose relevant documents .
Though he denied the allegations , he said he was now prepared to set up an inquiry under European human rights convention articles enshrining the right to life and prohibiting torture , or inhuman or degrading treatment .
The government made the concession after documents , which contradict claims made on oath by officials , were belatedly disclosed to the high court .
They reveal that ministers , possibly including Tony Blair , knew much more about the incident than they have admitted .
In a series of sharp exchanges , Lord Justice Scott Baker accused the Ministry of Defence of " a complete waste of time , at vast expense " for failing to disclose important evidence in hearings that have been going on for nearly two years .
He also lambasted the MoD for claiming gagging orders on information that had already been published .
The judge described the ministry 's behaviour as " extremely worrying " .
The military police have consistently claimed an investigation into the allegations was unnecessary as the Iraqis had not complained about their treatment until much later .
Documents revealed to the court today showed that the Iraqi detainees had complained at the time to the Red Cross .
They also show that ministers knew about them a week after the incident on 14 May 2004 .
On that day British troops fought with insurgents in a fierce exchange known as " the battle of Danny Boy " , a road checkpoint near Majar - al - Kabir in Maysan province .
The next day the bodies of 20 Iraqis were returned to their families .
Six Iraqis have been seeking an inquiry into the allegation that some of the 20 were taken as prisoners to Camp Abu Naji , an army base , where they were interrogated and tortured before being killed .
The MoD says all 20 died " on the battlefield " and their bodies were taken to Abu Naji to be photographed , to see if one was an insurgent suspected of helping kill six military police the previous year .
It says only nine live prisoners were taken to the camp , and all left alive .
A subsequent military police investigations cleared UK forces of any wrongdoing .
Clive Lewis QC , for the MoD , said no decision had yet been made on what kind of inquiry would be set up .
He suggested it could take the form of a police investigation , though not by the military police , or incorporated into a public inquiry – due to start later this month – into the death of Baha Mousa , the Basra hotel receptionist killed in British custody in 2003 .
The European convention states that an inquiry must be independent .
Scott Baker warned the MoD he did not want an inquiry " just to disappear in the undergrowth " .
Crucial documents disclosed yesterday show that Red Cross officials visited the British detention facility between 17 May and 19 May 2004 , a few days after the incident .
Though they praised some aspects of the detention centre , they referred to what they called " one major concern " – a Red Cross doctor said in some cases " injuries to wrists indicated excessive force " .
He added that injuries to the face suggested they were inflicted when the detainees were being " held down " or " defenceless " .
The Red Cross asked for an investigation .
The documents show that the MoD hierarchy , including Adam Ingram , then armed forces minister , was told about the Red Cross concerns a few days later and that the military police had started an investigation .
They include a draft letter from Ingram to 10 Downing Street passing on the information .
Rabinder Singh QC , for the Iraqis , told the high court yesterday : " What ca n't now be said is that the claimants [ the Iraqis ] did not make complaints and therefore there was no need for an investigation at the time . "
It was impossible to exaggerate the seriousness of the matter , he said , noting that his clients had been called liars many times .
He continued : " Somebody in the government must have known they had indeed done what they said in court . "
He added : " Ministers were told the case was being investigated and it was not . "
Singh singled out Colonel Dudley Giles , a senior military police officer and MoD witness .
He had " not told the truth to this court , in evidence , he did not tell the truth " about when investigations into the allegations were first made , Singh said .
Scott Baker , sitting with Mr Justice Silber and Mr Justice Sweeney , showed their view about the MoD 's attitude by awarding especially high " indemnity costs " to the Iraqis ' lawyers .
The judge also agreed to stay the current judicial review hearings , but not until the MoD had said what kind of inquiry it proposed to set up .
Phil Shiner , solicitor for the Iraqis , said that for years they had been accused of lying " for propaganda reasons " .
He described it as " a momentous day " .
The armed forces minister , Bill Rammell , said : " It is clear from the evidence that no one was murdered or ill - treated by British forces .
It is also clear that British forces did not mutilate corpses on the battlefield , and there is independent expert testimony to support this . "
He added : " However , these are serious allegations and we regret that we have failed to provide the court with timely and sufficient disclosure of information to enable them to determine the facts . "
Here you ’ll find all of the random odds and ends that have collected like debris at the bottom of my web page shower drain .
Unlike that nasty mix of hair and shampoo residue , however , this clump of entertainment is actually fun .

July 22 , 2009 , New York , NY – Today , United States District Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis ruled in favor of the plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit charging the Fire Department of New York ( FDNY ) with racially discriminatory hiring practices .
The case , which proved the FDNY examination was in violation of civil rights laws , was filed on behalf of the Vulcan Society , the fraternal organization of Black firefighters in the FDNY by the Center for Constitutional Rights ( CCR ) and co-counsel from Levy Ratner , P.C. and Scott + Scott , LLP .
“ From 1999 to 2007 , the New York City Fire Department used written examinations with discriminatory effects and little relationship to the job of a firefighter … [ that ] unfairly excluded hundreds of qualified people of color from the opportunity to serve as New York City firefighters , ” said Judge Garaufis in the Memorandum and Order .
“ Today , the court holds that New York City ’s reliance on these examinations constitutes employment discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 . ”
“ The court found that the city closed the door on over a thousand qualified candidates of color , ” said CCR attorney Darius Charney .
“ This is a tremendous victory that we ’ve been fighting towards for over seven years and we applaud the court for recognizing that the FDNY written examination has no bearing on whether or not a firefighter is qualified . ”
As of October 2007 , black and Hispanic firefighters comprised only 3.4 and 6.7 percent of the FDNY , respectively .
The combined black and Hispanic population of New York City comprises over half its total population .
New York City has the least diverse fire department of any major city in America ; 57 percent of Los Angeles , 51 percent of Philadelphia and 40 percent of Boston firefighters are people of color .
“ Racial discrimination is still alive and well in our city ’s institutions , ” said Paul Washington , past president of the Vulcan Society .
“ We celebrate today ’s decision for recognizing that unfair firefighter exams and other employment schemes that only serve to block qualified candidates have no place in public service . ”
In April of this year , CCR and its co-counsel asked Judge Garaufis to grant summary judgment in favor of the Vulcan Society , the fraternal organization of Black firefighters in the FDNY , and three individual candidates in light of the overwhelming evidence supporting their claims , thus eliminating the need for a trial .
CCR , Levy Ratner , and Scott +
Scott formally filed to intervene on behalf of the Vulcan Society in the Department of Justice 's lawsuit against the City of New York for discriminatory hiring practices in July 2007 .
The lawsuit grew out of two Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ( EEOC ) filings by CCR on behalf of the Vulcan Society in 2002 and 2005 .

damn - billy is WRONG on everything , but his proclamation about government run healthcare being better is RIGHT .
But his statement that private citizens should n't have it is WRONG - so I guess his unbroken streak of ignorance is still intact .
Amazing that a guy this wrong this often is used by the mainstream media as an " expert " on anything .
Just another lying liar , so I guess he is a good tool to " catapult the propaganda . "

Actually even in being wrong he 's wrong , the VA always has too many budget cuts to be the ' premium healthcare that our soldiers deserve ' .

Vermont ???
Weird .

Okay , so ...
They 're against government - run health care ( because it 's so bad ) , but it's what the troops have ( because they deserve the best ) .
But that Walter Reed story did n't sound like they 're getting the best .
So maybe government - run care IS pretty bad .
But wait , is n't Congress 's health care government - run , too ?
And I get the impression IT 'S pretty goddamn awesome .
My bullshit - meter went boing a long time ago or I 'd consult it .
But I guess all you really need is a sense of smell .

For that time poll , its funny that Brian Williams and Jon Stewart comprise 73 % of the results , and Brian Williams is a frequent guest on the Daily show , and I find him to be VERY funny , with a very quick wit .
Of course it IS an on - line poll which probably skews things in the favor of Stewart , since most rural people are n't going to watch the daily show and probably dont spend a large amount of time on - line either .
It is a sad statement about the media that a freaking comedian is our most trusted news source ....

Billy is ' one of them ' and a Palin cheerleader to boot .
He contradicts himself all of the time .
So anyway ... Jon is the most trusted newsman because of this prime example .
Stop and write his crap down because it gives everyone the time to digest this lying sack of shit 's hypocrisy .

So the USA will provide healthcare for the very poor , sell healthcare to fortunate upper classes , but force 50 million middle , working class members to choose which sacrifice to make - ( ? )
A family 's choice to pay monthly healthcare premiums giving wealthy insurance companies and multimillion dollar CEO 's a guaranteed yearly revenue as opposed to saving for their children 's college educations is a pretty tough choice .
( In the USA life is Russian Roulette - and the American Dream is dead , if you want to afford for good health ?
Or is it where the healthcare and tax " systems " are designed to eventually completely drain family assets and inheritances ? )
If that same child has terminal cancer will the government then come in and force chemo treatments and then take the family 's home and assets away to pay for it ?
Straddle the family with payment slavery and collections abuse , credit trashing for the next fifty years ?
Will seized family assets then go to the millionaires who run the medical businesses ?
Will the government force psychiatric institutionalization for a terminal patient who chooses suicide instead of financial devastation and sacrifice of his children 's inheritance to medical " businesses ? "
And then seize his assets for business profit , to cover costs after the forced " treatment ? "
In healthcare arguments , greed always wins , while insanity - on - a salary –– mediates .
When the working classes are sick , stressed , and eventually eliminated , who will save up the money to attend an occasional concert or movie ?
Who will shop ?
Who will take a week 's vacation every year ?
Who will watch the TV every night , and listen to the advertisers ?
It 's a travesty the people arguing healthcare , lobbying Congress , and working the industry have no idea the plight and stresses of working class people .
These are the ones who work , struggle to live honest lives and whose children are sent to war .

Michelles rant could be titled the American Nightmare as opposed to the American Dream .
Spot on Michelle !!!
I figure that the oligarchs do not want to give us any type of universal healthcare because they can't hold our healthcare over our heads while we work their little shitty , unsafe low paying jobs .
That scares the shit out of them , it might create wage inflation as the workers start demanding more pay , it 'll be easier for the disgruntled worker to drag up .

You folks back home had better watch out , lest you become like those European " commies . "
Here in the Czech Republic I pay about 70 bucks a month for full medical , dental , and ophthalmological care .
True , I have to pay a buck - fifty surcharge for each doctor 's appointment and trip to the pharmacy for prescriptions , and hospitalization costs 3.50 a day , but the medical staff are all extremely well educated and competent , and the hospital where my physicians work is first - rate .
Some years ago my wife was diagnosed with a particularly nasty cancer , and for three years all the many surgical procedures , chemotherapy sessions , and medications were covered , so at least I was n't bankrupted by those costs ( there were other factors , of course , that bankrupted me ) .
I am disgusted and appalled by the tone of the debate over health care reform back in what was once my home country .
Moral bankruptcy is the only way I can describe the dollar worship I see there ...

Thank you Floridiot , and Czaragorn .
Just one medical test taking less an hour here can cost upward of $ 6,000.00 .
Some struggling , working poor mothers with children do n't earn that much money in six months .
There is a social spot where pride prevents people from accepting welfare and medicaid .
That 's the spot which is being erased .
Who would n't love to recover hours spent waiting in an American doctor 's waiting room , or emergency room ?
Or hours spent on the phone , on hold or listening to a telephone tree ?
We need to hear more from people like you Czaragorn .
It 's apparently the only way Americans will get the truth about " inferior healthcare " in " less successful " countries .
And Floridiot , you 're exactly right .
Corporations and businesses get their tentacles into a person 's soul , slave them with a salary and dangle medical benefits and savings plans over their heads to where they 've snared slaves for the next 20 - 30 years .
And they 're actually making money from it , to boot .
Take the salary and divide it by hours served , and hours spent at home worrying about losing the job .
The only humane thing a corporation can do is provide healthcare , ( hopefully with a good psychiatric plan . )
Our responsible government , with good conscience and having an established purpose of serving its people , must find ways to lower the costs of healthcare , and make it available to all Americans .
The medical industries will not do it alone .

To further add to the craziness , the political side of this is that local Democratic groups do not stand up to their elected officials who are in the pocket of the insurance and other industries .
People like me are castigated and called " lunatic fringe " " you do n't understand politics " " Kucinich never passed any worthwhile legislation because he is a purist " etc etc .
They call me defeatist because I rant about the importance of getting the right people in office ... being a D does n't mean shit if the D in question ( Baucus , et al ) do n't support progressive ideals ( which are contained within many local and state Democratic platforms , btw ! )
If it were n't for activists like myself ( and many of you ) and elected people like Kucinich , single - payer and a whole horde of other things would n't even be on the table .
Fuck compromise .
Why would we want to compromise with the same people ( republithugs / corporatists ) who want to destroy this country ?
Let 's draw the battle lines and fight this thing out .
If Baucus , Cantwell , Wyden , etc want to be on the other side of the battle line , we take them out by putting our energies behind real progressives , EVEN IF IT MEANS LOSING ELECTIONS TO REPUBLICANS .
We are where we are because we have played " lesser of two evils " for too long .
Idealist ?
Sue me .

The sideline reporter was young and attractive and more or less an open appeal to the lower enthusiasms of sports fans .
The year was 1974 .
Jim Lampley was here to tell America about mascots and homecoming queens .
Advertisement
Lampley was the first officially designated sideline reporter , along with Don Tollefson .
Both were discovered in a national talent hunt through which ABC Sports hoped to find a new broadcaster to " represent the face and voice of the American college student , " in Lampley 's words , which is to say that , from the very beginning , the sideline reporter was foremost a matter of cosmetics .
It was about market share .
It was someone with nice hair and a bright smile , delivering 24 seconds of cheerful inanities into a microphone .
A full three decades before Erin Andrews first walked a sideline , the job was very explicitly about , to borrow Christine Brennan 's phrase , playing to the frat house .
And now , 35 years later , the first sideline reporter is wondering why the job he pioneered still exists .
Advertisement
" I 'd get rid of it entirely , " says Lampley , ABC 's former " golden boy , " in the words of Sports Illustrated , who was once regarded as the presumptive heir to Jim McKay .
Lampley is now known mainly for his work on the Olympics and HBO 's boxing broadcasts .
" All the injury - related information , all the other sideline stuff , you can do that just by having somebody on the sideline who 's not on the air , reporting directly to the truck .
I just do n't see what it adds .
Unless I felt my viewership was going to go up because somebody was really good - looking , so dramatically , amazingly , dynamically good - looking .
But that does n't make any sense at all to me . "
This may slowly be dawning on the lords of television sports .
CBS and the NFL Network recently did away with sideline reporters , with no discernible cost to their coverage .
That 's a major development .
If there 's a symbol of sports television 's unruly growth in the latter half of the 20th century , it 's the sideline reporter , whose birth predates that of ESPN by just a few years .
In Lampley 's telling , the job grew out of the wreckage of the 1972 Munich Olympics , where new wireless technology was put to such vital use in ABC 's quicksilver coverage of the Israeli hostage crisis and the subsequent massacre .
Says Lampley : " Months later , they asked , ' What else could we do ?
Would it work in a football stadium ?
Could we put someone on the sidelines ? ' "
In 1974 , Lampley was in graduate school at North Carolina , and Tollefson was an undergrad at Stanford .
Both found themselves among 432 contestants for some vague ABC Sports job that lay enticingly at the other end of a gimmicky talent search , led by Dick Ebersol himself .
" The idea , " Lampley says , " was to have a new person on a college football telecast , someone who'd provide program material that would help differentiate college football from pro football , illuminate the unique lore and social interaction of college football . "
At the time , Lampley was studying mass communications in Chapel Hill and had worked radio broadcasts of UNC football and basketball games .
" I was screened out at first , " he says .
" They were looking for someone with zero on - air experience , someone who was definitely not a broadcast type . "
Advertisement
Lampley nevertheless got the job , and that fall he and Tollefson were thrown immediately into the mix .
" Sept. 7 , 1974 , " Lampley says .
" Tennessee - UCLA in Knoxville .
" Don was all over the telecast .
I was on 11 times .
I think he was on even more . "
He goes on : " I can tell you exactly the first time they threw to me during action .
It was early in the game . "
The day before , he'd had a lengthy interview with Tennessee quarterback Condredge Holloway .
Afterward , Holloway pulled Lampley aside and guaranteed that , the following day , he would throw for a touchdown on the Volunteers ' first play from scrimmage .
Says Lampley : " I 'm like , ' Pardon me ? '
He said , ' Trust me .
We spent all summer studying film .
We know exactly how they bit .
This is play - action to Stanley Morgan , and we 'll score on the first play from scrimmage . ' "
On Saturday , Tennessee won the coin toss .
Got the ball on the 20 .
Play - action to Stanley Morgan .
Eighty yards .
Touchdown .
Advertisement
" I had told the producer about it , " Lampley says , " and he remembered , and amid all the hoopla , Keith [ Jackson ] threw to me on the sideline .
I said , ' Keith , at our sitdown interview , Condredge told me he'd throw a touchdown pass on the first play of the game , etc. , etc . '
That was the first thing I did on camera .
You do n't get lucky that often .
[ Update , Sept , 3 , 2014 : Video 's online now .
Turns out Tennessee scored on its second play from scrimmage , not its first , on a 74 - yarder .
And as Classic TV Sports points out , play - by - play man Keith Jackson does n't actually throw to Lampley on the sideline after the touchdown .
It is n't until the 47:43 mark in the video below that Lampley delivers his first in - game report .
It 's an injury update . ]
" That game , we were all over the place .
If you wanted to liberally use a sideline reporter , let them really play a role , that telecast might show how it could work .
That was the height of ambition for the broadcast .
Two nights later , we did Georgia Tech vs. Notre Dame in Atlanta .
I think I was on three times . "
Advertisement
From the start , the notion of sideline reporters met with resistance from all points on the compass .
Coaches hated them , for obvious reasons .
Sports information directors , too .
" And sportswriters went berserk , " Lampley recalls .
" What we were doing , in effect , was threatening their sidebar stories . "
The issue came before the American Football Coaches Association , says Lampley , who was friendly in those days with one former AFCA president ( Paul Bryant ) and one future president ( Darrell Royal ) .
" The subject came up and Bryant said , ' Fuck it .
I like him . '
And that was the end of that . "
Lampley never had any illusions about the job .
" I never thought for a second that what we did was vital , " he says .
" What had been envisioned was that , several times during the telecast , they'd throw to the sideline , where a college - aged reporter would do something , within 24 seconds , on Herbie the mascot buffalo or the cheerleader who won homecoming queen or whatever .
And Keith is a no-nonsense guy of the highest order .
You can put that in bold print .
Pretty early on , I realized that despite everything that had been billed about this job , if I did it as they 'd originally conceived it , I was gonna be a pariah , persona non grata — to Keith , to the truck , to the viewers .
Because all of this was just nonsense . "

We pause here to note that Lisa Guerrero was still a quarter - century away .
If , for some , she represents the nadir of sideline reporting , she was also a natural step in the evolution of a position that was defiantly stupid from its very conception .
( Remember that , initially , ABC did n't want someone with actual experience . )
More than anyone , more than seasoned reporters like Andrea Kremer and Armen Keteyian , Guerrero was exactly what the job had called for , from the first : a smiling , pleasantly daft cheerleader .
ABC asked Lampley to work the 1977 season , but he " screamed bloody murder " and begged off .
" The next person who worked the sidelines for ABC — how shocking is this — was a young , beautiful woman , " he says .
It was Anne Simon , last seen around these parts getting slowly consumed by Bear Bryant 's hat .
" From that point forward , the bulk of what you see are young , attractive woman .
Obviously , 90 percent of them are very bright , eager to become legitimate sports reporters , but it puts them immediately into an awkward position .

" When something is not utterly vital , when something is totally insignificant , it 's very easy to go to the next consideration , which is the cosmetics , " Lampley continues .
" There 's no question [ producers ] think the cosmetic value means something .
Obviously , they think it filters into the mix that prompts more people to stay and watch a telecast .
I just doubt that 's the case .
If my goal today was to look at a beautiful woman , I do n't have to turn on the Notre Dame - USC telecast .
I 've got 147 channels to choose from , and I can get a better look than through a peephole darkly , in a hotel room . "
With about 55 million U.S. children heading back to school in the next few weeks , concerns are growing that the H1N1 swine flu will spread even further than it already has .
Identified by scientists four months ago , the virus has already turned up in nearly every corner of the world , from Argentina to Iran .
It defied public - health officials ' predictions of a lull in the warm summer months , proliferating in military units and children 's summer camps .
More than two million people are believed to have contracted the new flu in ...
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Obama announced Monday his choice for surgeon general -- Dr. Regina Benjamin , a 52 - year - old family practice doctor who has spent most of her career tending to the needs of poor patients in a Gulf Coast clinic in Alabama .
Dr. Regina Benjamin holds advanced degrees in medicine and business administration .
" When people could n't pay , she did n't charge them , " Obama said .
" When the clinic was n't making money , she did n't take a salary for herself . "
He called Benjamin " a relentless promoter " of programs to fight preventable illness .
Benjamin cited the toll of preventable illness as the reason her family was not with her at the announcement :
Her father died with diabetes and high blood pressure ; her older brother and only sibling died at age 44 of an HIV - related illness ; her mother died of lung cancer after taking up smoking as a girl ; her mother 's twin brother could not attend because he is at home " struggling for each breath " after a lifetime of smoking .
" I can not change my family 's past , but I can be a voice to improve our nation 's health for the future , " she said .
Watch for more on Benjamin »
Benjamin received a bachelor 's degree in 1979 from Xavier University of Louisiana , attended Morehouse School of Medicine from 1980 to 1982 , and received a doctor of medicine degree from the University of Alabama at Birmingham in 1984 .
She completed her residency in family practice at the Medical Center of Central Georgia in 1987 .
Health Library MayoClinic.com : Health Library
Her medical training was paid for by a federal program , the National Health Service Corps , under which medical students promise to work in areas with few doctors in exchange for free tuition , one year of service for every year of paid tuition .
Benjamin founded the Bayou La Batre Rural Health Clinic in 1990 in the fishing village of Bayou La Batre , Alabama , and has served as its CEO since .
Like many of her patients , the clinic has suffered its own life - threatening challenges .
It was heavily damaged by Hurricane Georges in 1998 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005 .
It also burned to the ground several years ago .
But Benjamin rebuilt it after each setback and has continued to offer medical care to the village 's 2,500 residents .
Her commitment to them has meant making house calls during the rebuilding , mortgaging her house and maxing out her credit cards , Obama said .
" Regina Benjamin has refused to give up ; her patients have refused to give up , " he said .
Many of her family practice patients are immigrants from Vietnam , Cambodia and Laos who make up a third of Bayou La Batre 's population , and many of them are uninsured .
Benjamin's expertise goes beyond medicine ; she earned a master 's in business administration in 1991 from Tulane University .
But her focus has not been on making money for herself , she said .
" My priority has always been the needs of my patients , " she said .
" I decided to treat patients regardless of their ability to pay . "
Benjamin said she has worked for years to scrape together the resources needed to keep the clinic doors open and found " it has not been an easy road .
...
It should not be this hard for doctors and other health care providers to care for their patients . "
She praised Obama " for putting health care reform at the top of your domestic agenda , " and said she hopes , if confirmed by the Senate , " to be America 's doctor , America 's family physician . "
" As we work toward a solution to this health care crisis , I promise to communicate directly to the American people , to help guide them through whatever changes come with health care reform .
I want to make sure that no one falls through the cracks , " she said .
A call to the clinic , where Benjamin was working last week , found it in full swing .
" We are just packed in with patients right now , and I 'm the only one at the front office , " said a breathless woman who then hung up .
Benjamin has served as the associate dean for rural health at the University of South Alabama 's College of Medicine and as president of the State of Alabama Medical Association , from 2002 - 2003 .
She was the first African - American woman board member of the American Medical Association , and she just served a term as chairwoman of the group 's Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs .
The position of surgeon general , whose effectiveness is largely in its use as a bully pulpit , requires Senate confirmation .

' My mummy 's poorly ' : Two - year - old girl dials 999 to save her mother 's life
A toddler helped save her mother 's life after she collapsed with an allergic reaction - by dialling 999 .
Isabelle Keeling , 2 , called the emergency services as her mother Joanne suffered a reaction to latex at their home in Bournemouth , Dorset .
Just the day before , Isabelle had watched an episode of the children 's TV programme Tweenies where she had seen how to call 999 .
Two - year - old Isabelle Keeling saved her mother 's life by phoning paramedics
Police officer Mrs Keeling felt the reaction come on , but her Epi-pen adrenalin jab did not immediately work .
She said to Isabelle , ' Can you get the phone , mummy is poorly , ' and then collapsed .
' I heard Izzi on the phone talking to someone and I was thinking : " I need that phone .
Now is not the time to be talking to someone by pressing the redial button " , ' Mrs Keeling , 34 , said .
But Isabelle was in fact talking to the emergency services operator , and was able to give her name , address and telephone number .
The toddler had seen how to call 999 on an episode of the Tweenies
She even opened up the front door to let in neighbours and paramedics , who were able to promptly treat her mother .

' She picks up everything we say and last year after the US Presidential elections she was going around saying " US president Obama " .
' So what she did was amazing , but that 's Isabelle really .
I never imagined her wonderful ability to retain information would one day help me .'
A French hacker has posted screenshots backing claims that he breached Twitter 's administrative panel , threatening the security and integrity of high - profile accounts and exposing private information to the public , such as the account holder 's e-mail address , IP address , mobile phone number in some cases and list of accounts blocked by the user .
The screen shots show internal settings and information for Twitter accounts belonging to U.S President Barack Obama , actor Ashton Kutcher , and singers Lily Allen and Britney Spears .
The info reveals that the Obama account has blocked more than 90 users from sending it messages .
The screen shots also revealed a list of users who have been blacklisted by Twitter .
Twitter confirmed the intrusion and said that only ten accounts had been compromised and that no information in the accounts had been altered .
Unlike an attack earlier this year when a hacker gained access to a Twitter administrator 's account by using a password cracker to guess her log - in credential , the French hacker , who goes by the handle " Hacker Croll " gained access by breaching a Twitter administrator 's Yahoo e-mail account , where he found an e-mail from Twitter that disclosed the administrator 's Twitter password .
To gain access to the Yahoo account , the hacker simply reset the password to the account by answering the secret question .
Croll does n't say what the secret question was .
Unlike the previous Twitter hack attack , Croll did n't send out phony messages from the compromised accounts .
In other news , the Pentagon discussed this week how it uses Twitter to seek out recruits and spread the military 's message .
The martial art known as Hapkido is an art of complete self defense .
Those who study it are more than capable of defending themselves in any type of situation , being more than able to apply their confidence and discipline from the art to enhance their lives , protecting themselves and those that they love as well . [...]
Coffee drinkers may have another reason to pour that extra cup .
When aged mice bred to develop symptoms of Alzheimer 's disease were given caffeine – the equivalent of five cups of coffee a day – their memory impairment was reversed , report University of South Florida researchers at the Florida Alzheimer 's Disease Research Center .
Back - to - back studies published online July 6 in the Journal of Alzheimer 's Disease , show caffeine significantly decreased abnormal levels of the protein linked to Alzheimer 's disease , both in the brains and in the blood of mice exhibiting symptoms of the disease .
Both studies build upon previous research by the Florida ADRC group showing that caffeine in early adulthood prevented the onset of memory problems in mice bred to develop Alzheimer 's symptoms in old age .
" The new findings provide evidence that caffeine could be a viable ' treatment ' for established Alzheimer 's disease , and not simply a protective strategy , " said lead author Gary Arendash , PhD , a USF neuroscientist with the Florida ADRC .
" That 's important because caffeine is a safe drug for most people , it easily enters the brain , and it appears to directly affect the disease process . "
Based on these promising findings in mice , researchers at the Florida ADRC and Byrd Alzheimer 's Center at USF hope to begin human trials to evaluate whether caffeine can benefit people with mild cognitive impairment or early Alzheimer 's disease , said Huntington Potter , PhD , director of the Florida ADRC and an investigator for the caffeine studies .
The research group has already determined that caffeine administered to elderly non-demented humans quickly affects their blood levels of β- amyloid , just as it did in the Alzheimer 's mice .
" These are some of the most promising Alzheimer 's mouse experiments ever done showing that caffeine rapidly reduces beta amyloid protein in the blood , an effect that is mirrored in the brain , and this reduction is linked to cognitive benefit , " Potter said .
" Our goal is to obtain the funding needed to translate the therapeutic discoveries in mice into well - designed clinical trials . "
Arendash and his colleagues became interested in caffeine 's potential for treating Alzheimer 's several years ago , after a Portuguese study reported that people with Alzheimer 's had consumed less caffeine over the last 20 years than people without the neurodegenerative disease .
Since then , several uncontrolled clinical studies have reported moderate caffeine consumption may protect against memory decline during normal aging .
The highly controlled studies using Alzheimer 's mice allowed researchers to isolate the effects of caffeine on memory from other lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise , Arendash said .

The just - published Florida ADRC study included 55 mice genetically altered to develop memory problems mimicking Alzheimer 's disease as they aged .
After behavioral tests confirmed the mice were exhibiting signs of memory impairment at age 18 to 19 months – about age 70 in human years – the researchers gave half the mice caffeine in their drinking water .
The other half got plain water .
The Alzheimer 's mice received the equivalent of five 8 - oz. cups of regular coffee a day .
That 's the same amount of caffeine – 500 milligrams -- as contained in two cups of specialty coffees like Starbucks , or 14 cups of tea , or 20 soft drinks .
At the end of the two - month study , the caffeinated mice performed much better on tests measuring their memory and thinking skills .
In fact , their memories were identical to normal aged mice without dementia .
The Alzheimer 's mice drinking plain water continued to do poorly on the tests .
In addition , the brains of the caffeinated mice showed nearly a 50 - percent reduction in levels of beta amyloid , a substance forming the sticky clumps of plaques that are a hallmark of Alzheimer 's disease .
Other experiments by the same investigators indicate that caffeine appears to restore memory by reducing both enzymes needed to produce beta amyloid .
The researchers also suggest that caffeine suppresses inflammatory changes in the brain that lead to an overabundance of beta amyloid .
Since caffeine improved the memory of mice with pre-existing Alzheimer 's , the researchers were curious to know if it might further boost the memory of non-demented ( normal ) mice administered caffeine from young adulthood through old age .
It did not .
Control mice given regular drinking water throughout their lives performed as well on behavioral tests in old age as normal mice who received long - term caffeine treatment , Arendash said .
" This suggests that caffeine will not increase memory performance above normal levels .
Rather , it appears to benefit those destined to develop Alzheimer 's disease . "
The researchers do not know if an amount lower than the 500 mg .
daily caffeine intake received by the Alzheimer 's mice would be effective , Arendash said .
For most individuals , however , this moderate level of caffeine intake poses no adverse health effects , according to both the National Research Council and the National Academy of Sciences .
Nonetheless , Arendash said , individuals with high blood pressure or those who are pregnant should limit their daily caffeine intake .
If larger , more rigorous clinical studies confirm that caffeine staves off Alzheimer 's in humans , as it does in mice , this benefit would be substantial , Arendash said .
Alzheimer 's disease attacks nearly half of Americans age 85 and older , and Alzheimer 's and other dementias triple healthcare costs for those age 65 and older , according to the Alzheimer 's Association .
In addition to the Florida ADRC , Byrd Alzheimer 's Center and Eric Pfeiffer Suncoast Alzheimer 's and Gerontology Center at USF , researchers from the Bay Pines VA Healthcare System ; Saitama Medical University , Saitama , Japan ; and Washington University School of Medicine , St. Louis , collaborated on the research .
The studies were supported by grants to investigators in the Florida ADRC , a statewide project sponsored by the National Institute on Aging and housed at the University of South Florida 's Byrd Alzheimer 's Center .
The remnants of four different galaxy clusters comprise the large cluster MACSJ0717 .
The galaxy cluster labelled “ C ” is thought to be the “ original ” cluster , while the motions ( arrows ) of clusters B , D , and A are all thought to have been funnelled into the cluster from an attached filament ( lower left ) .
( The cluster labelled “ A ” is thought to have moved through the larger cluster once and is now falling back towards its centre . )
( Image : X- ray ( NASA / CXC / IfA / C Ma et al. ) ; Optical ( NASA / STScI / IfA /C Ma et al. ) )
The first tantalising signs of gas within a filament of dark matter have been glimpsed at the site of a cataclysmic collision between galaxy clusters .
If future observations confirm the preliminary detection , it would provide an important test of computer simulations that show how large - scale cosmic structures form .
The simulations suggest that matter is distributed in a cosmic web , with material flowing along filamentary structures and pooling where the filaments intersect .
Dark matter is thought to act as the scaffolding for this web , and researchers say as much as 40 % of all dark matter in the universe may lie in the filaments .
But although observations have found that galaxies and galaxy clusters do indeed lie in filaments , so far no gas or dark matter have been confirmed in the highway - like structures .

“ It ’s only logical that the gas and the dark matter trace the same structure , but quantitatively , we do not know whether the simulations and the observations match , ” says Harald Ebeling of the University of Hawaii .
Observing the gas in a filament could help gauge how much dark matter lies in the filament and thereby test theoretical models , he says , but “ the gas in a filament has never been unambiguously detected ” .
Now , he and a team led by Cheng - Jiun Ma say they see hints of gas in a filament that appears to be funnelling galaxies into a galaxy cluster already crammed with them .
‘ 800 - pound gorilla ’
In 2004 , Ebeling and colleagues discovered that a filamentary structure of galaxies seemed to be connected to a gigantic cluster of galaxies discovered several years earlier .
The cluster , called MACSJ0717.5+3745 , lies about 5.4 billion light years from Earth and has quite an odd structure – it ’s far from a simple , round ball of galaxies .
“ This is the proverbial 800 - pound gorilla in space , ” Ebeling told New Scientist .
“ It ’s one of the most massive known clusters anywhere , and certainly one of the most messed up I know . ”
That kind of disarray suggested the cluster had been involved in a merger of some kind , but its history was difficult to tease apart .
3D motions
Now , the researchers believe they have decoded the cluster ’s history , by combining data at a variety of wavelengths to reveal the 3D motions of regions within the cluster .
Spectral observations can reveal the motions of objects towards and away from Earth , since that kind of motion compresses or stretches the wavelengths of the objects ’ light in a detectable way .
Measuring side - to - side motion can be more difficult .
To do this , the team looked for offsets between bright X - ray regions – which represent superheated gas – and regions bright in optical light , which represent stars and galaxies .
Such offsets can occur when galaxy clusters collide – their stars tend to pass through the smashups unimpeded , but the hot gas in the clusters lags behind ( see Dark matter and normal matter divorce in cosmic clash ) .
Four clusters
The observations revealed what appear to be the remnants of four galaxy clusters within MACSJ0717.5+3745 – one large one that may have been the ‘ original ’ member of the cluster and three others whose motions suggests they were funnelled into the system from the connected filament .
Intriguingly , the researchers identified a very wide region of extremely hot , dense gas where the filament hits the cluster .
“ We speculate that continuous heating from the filament – with gas flowing in all the time – causes this , ” Ebeling says .
‘ Holy grail ’
The team has submitted a proposal to observe the cluster again – for a longer period – with the Chandra X-ray Observatory .
They hope to measure the temperature of X - rays at a higher spatial resolution to see “ whether there is indeed a step [ in temperature ] at the location where we expect there to be ” if gas from the filament is flowing into the cluster , Ebeling says .
They also hope to see gas within the filament that lies farther away from where the filament connects with the cluster .
“ Right now , we ’re only just barely seeing [ filament gas ] where it hits the cluster , ” he says .
“ But as you move away from the cluster , the gas is still unperturbed , ” Ebeling says .
“ This is the pristine , original state of gas in filaments – the holy grail for observational X - ray searches . ”
Difficult analysis
The filament gas is less dense than gas within the cluster , and much cooler – gas within the cluster can exceed 200 million °C , while gas within the filament may be 10 % as hot .
Still , the observation may be challenging to interpret because groups of galaxies are likely embedded within this cooler , low - density filament gas , says Ebeling .
“ But if we can ever do this , this is the system to do it with – it ’s the biggest and best understood , ” he says .
Ralph Kraft of the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics agrees with the team that their evidence that gas is falling from the filament into the cluster is only “ suggestive ” .
But he says it is “ potentially the most interesting aspect ” of the work : “ There are n’t a whole lot of observational constraints ” on theoretical models that show how filaments feed the formation of large - scale cosmic structures , he told New Scientist .

Schäuble besuchte gestern am 28.08.2009 das Heinrich - Pesch - Haus in Ludwigshafen .
Als Pirat war es für mich natürlich eine Pflichtveranstaltung .
Dort angekommen gab es die erste unangenehme Überraschung .
Von 7
Plakaten , die wir aufgehängt hatten , waren nur noch 3 vorhanden ( 2 davon hingen an der Haltestelle zum Heinrich - Pesch - Haus , das Dritte hat in die Einfahrt des Heinrich - Pesch - Hauses gezeigt ) .
Von den Grünen , die ebenfalls vertreten waren , wurden ebenfalls einige Plakate entwendet .
Wer die Plakate entwendet hat , darf nun spekuliert werden , aber ich denke mal , wir kennen den Täter bereits .
Die Anzeige werde ich dann wohl am Dienstag erstatten .
Nebst den verschwundenen Plakaten gab es noch weitere unangenehme Überraschungen .
Kaum dass wir da waren wurden seitens Polizei heimlich Fotos von uns angefertigt .
Uns wurde zu dieser öffentlichen !
Veranstaltung der Zutritt untersagt .
Die Frage warum wir von einer öffentlichen Veranstaltung ausgeschlossen werden sollen , wurde seitens des Organisators der Veranstaltung von der CDU mit den Worten : „ Ich diskuttiere nicht . “ beantwortet .
Im späteren Verlauf wurde dann gesagt , dass man befürchte , wir ( Piraten und Grüne Jugend ) könnten die Veranstaltung stören .
Auch ein Versprechen , nicht zu stören , das zur Not auch schriftlich zu geben , wurde abgewiesen .
Dieser Ausschluß war übrigens möglich , weil es sich beim Heinrich - Pesch - Haus um ein Privatgelände handelt , über das der Eigentümer bzw . im gestrigen Falle der Veranstalter verfügt .
Man ging sogar noch weiter , man hat seitens Polizei meine Daten aufgenommen , denn es könnte ja sein , dass ein Pirat die Veranstaltung stören könnte .
Wir waren ganze zwei Piraten und waren bereits von der Veanstaltung ausgeschlossen .
Zwei Polizisten haben dann auch noch untereinander diskutiert , ob denn ein Treffen von zwei oder erst von drei Personen eine anmeldepflichtige Veranstaltung wäre .
In ersterem Falle hätte ich somit mit einer Anzeige wegen Verstoßes gegen das Versammlungsgesetz zu rechnen .
Als nächstes wurde das Auto eines „ Grünen “ durchsucht , es könnte sich ja ein Sprengsatz , o.Ä. dort befinden .
Seitens der CDU war man anfangs doch nun ja , mutig , denn sie waren zu einer „ Diskussion “ des Parteiprogramms bereit .
Auf die Frage , was denn die CDU so macht und warum man sie wählen sollte wurden wir darauf hingewiesen , dass wir doch bitte erst das Wahlprogramm lesen sollten .
Warum kennt ein CDUler das Parteiprogramm nicht ?
Die Frage , warum man CDU wählen solle , wurde dann aber mit einem sinngemäßen „ Weil die CDU eine tolle Finanzpolitik betreibt “ beantwortet .
Leider zog der CDUler , der diese Aussage tätigte schmollend davon , als ich es gewagt habe , zu fragen , warum denn in dieser tollen Finanzpolitik , ein Mann , der die HRE an die Wand gefahren hat , denn nun im Ausschuß sitzt , der über die Geldvergabe an die Banken entscheidet , in dieses Amt kommen kann .
Insgesamt ging man doch sehr grob mit uns ( immernoch Piraten und Grüne ) um .
Es wurde peinlichst darauf geachtet , dass niemand von uns die weiße Linie , die den Bürgersteig vom Gelände des Heinrich - Pesch - Hauses trennt , übertritt .
Ebenfalls nun ja , war man sehr darauf bedacht , dass wir die Einfahrt freihalten .
Gut , ist verständlich , aber dass man selbst wenn kein Auto kommt und einer einen Meter in einer 5 m breiten Einfahrt steht darauf hingewiesen wird , dass man die Einfahrt freizuhalten habe …. nun ich erspare mir hier jeglichen Kommentar .
Und dann war es soweit , unser hochgeschätzer Herr Schäuble kam in einer schwarzen S - Klasse vorgefahren .
Seitens der Ordnungshüter hat man schon fast versucht uns nicht nur mit Worten davon abzuhalten , Herrn Schäuble entgegenzukommen .
Es kam allerdings zu keinen körperlichen Berührungspunkten .
Selbst nachdem Herr Schäuble im Haus war , wurde uns untersagt , uns auf dem Bürgersteig ( der übrigens öffentlicher !
Raum ist ) in der Nähe der Einfahrt , die Schäuble genommen hat , zu stehen .
Nach mehrfachen Protest mussten wir dann allerdings das Feld räumen und haben uns wieder nahe der Besuchereinfahrt gesammelt .
Als Grund für die „ Vertreibung “ wurde uns später genannt , dass es zur Sicherheitsstrategie gehöre , dass dort keiner stehen dürfe .
Nunja ….
Schäuble braucht wirklich jede nur erdenkliche Sicherheit , Handyüberwachung zur Ortsbestimmung , permanente Videoüberwachung , jedes Wort , dass er spricht , oder auch nur denkt , muss aufgezeichnet werden !
Trotz aller Schikanen hatte der Abend dennoch etwas Gutes , denn wir Piraten haben uns mit der Grünen Jugend prächtig amüsiert und auch das ein oder andere Gruppenbild gemacht .
Wenn mir dieser
Abend eines gezeigt hat , dann dass die CDU richtig Angst vor uns hat und versucht uns bei jeglicher Möglichkeit zu bekämpfen und zur Not auch mit unrechten Mitteln .
Wie war das gleich mit der Plakatierung in Ludwigshafen bereits in der Nacht von Donnerstag auf Freitag , wenn die Plakate erst ab Sonntag hängen dürfen und dann auch noch JEDE !
Laterne , auch an Ampeln zuzuhängen ?
Wie dem auch sei , wir werden weitermachen und uns nicht unterkriegen lassen .
Denn wie sagte Mahatma Gandhi so treffend :
„ Zuerst ignorieren sie dich , dann lachen sie über dich , dann bekämpfen sie dich und dann gewinnst du . “
In diesem Sinne : Klarmachen zum Ändern !

ARLINGTON , Texas --
The Tennessee Titans felt they exposed a major flaw in Cowboys Stadium during the first football game played in the building when reserve punter A.J. Trapasso hit the gigantic HD screen that hangs over the field .
But after a 30 - 10 Dallas win , Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said he does n't think it is an issue .
The NFL signed off on the 160 - foot long , 90 - foot high video board , Jones said , and he does not plan to alter it .
The stadium 's gigantic TV screen , suspended above the field and measuring roughly 60 yards wide by 25 yards high , is being called for punt interference .
Tim Heitman / US Presswire
After Trapasso's punt with 8:07 on the clock in the third quarter , Tennessee coach Jeff Fisher threw his red challenge flag and talked to referee Walt Anderson before fourth down was replayed .
" It 's an issue , yeah , " said Fisher , who serves as co-chairman of the NFL 's competition committee .
" I 'm sure the Cowboys or the league will tell you , I should n't have to throw a flag out there because [ the officiating crew ] did n't see the ball hit the scoreboard .
Now , it 's not necessarily their responsibility .
Once a fair catch signal is given , then there are no eyes on the ball anymore .
So they do n't see it .
So something has to get worked out .
It can become a problem . "
Said Jones after his team 's debut in the $ 1.2 billion stadium : " You do n't need to move it .
You gotta be trying to do it .
The rule is very clear .
You just kick it over . "
Jones implied that having the video board in play provided an " entertainment value " and that both teams would have to deal with it .
But the owner repeatedly said that the normal trajectory of an NFL punt would not bring the video board into play .
He could move a Mitsubishi Electric sign that hangs off the bottom edge of the board .
Both Trapasso , an undrafted rookie out of Ohio State , and veteran Craig Hentrich hit the video board in warm-ups and marveled at how engineers , architects and ownership failed to anticipate the issue .
" I hit it probably a dozen times in pregame , " Hentrich said .
" Probably somewhere around a five - second punt is going to hit it and some of the guys in the league would n't be able to punt here if it's not raised ; they 'd just be nonstop hitting it .
I do n't know what the people were thinking .
I guess they should have tested things out before they put that thing in place .
It 'll have to be raised . "
Jones said a punter needed to kick the ball " straight up and hard " to have any chance of making contact with the board .
He did n't understand why anyone would take that approach .
Trapasso said he did n't try to hit the board during the game , but admitted warm - ups were different .
Cowboys punter Mat McBriar never came close to hitting the video board .
It was his first time punting at Cowboys Stadium and he said he does n't think it will be an issue for him .
Trapasso's not in line to be part of the Titans ' roster after cut - downs .
But he 's made a mark in just three preseason games , scoring a 40 - yard touchdown on fake punt in the Hall of Fame Game on Aug. 9 and qualifying as the first player to put the Cowboys ' scoreboard into play .
He joked that San Diego 's Mike Scifres " might put a hole in the bottom of that thing . "
The Chargers are scheduled to play in Arlington on Dec. 13 .
" With the size of that TV , there 's not going to be a whole lot of room above it , " he said .
" I think after a billion dollars and the way you watch people kick , somebody could have figured that math out a little bit . "

Arab television channel Al Jazeera says it is stunned by a decision banning it from the West Bank and has been forced to shut its studios in Ramallah .
The Palestinian Authority has threatened legal action over allegations aired on Tuesday that Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas conspired with Israel to kill his predecessor , Yasser Arafat , in 2003 .
The following year , Mr Arafat died in Paris of an undisclosed illness .
The accusations were made by a rival member of Mr Abbas ' Fatah party , Farouq al - Qadoumi , and aired during a half - hour program .
The information ministry in Ramallah says the allegations are false and has accused Al Jazeera of bias .
The TV station says it is astonished at the decision to ban it from the West Bank and will issue a statement to answer the accusations .

Advertisement Women boxers will have the chance to fight for gold at the 2012 Olympics .
International Olympic Committee chiefs voted on Thursday to lift the barrier to the last all - male summer sport .
Three women's weight classes will be added to the Olympic programme for 2012 Games in London , with one of the 11 men 's classes dropped to make room .
" Women 's boxing has come on a tremendous amount in the last five years and it was time to include them , " said IOC president Jacques Rogge .
Women will fight at flyweight ( 48 - 51kg ) , lightweight ( 56-60kg ) and middleweight ( 69-75kg ) .
MATT SLATER'S BLOG Women already fight in the Olympics ' three other combat sports - judo , taekwondo and wrestling .
Is boxing really more dangerous than taekwondo ?
The IOC 's decision was described as " historic " by Olympics minister Tessa Jowell .
" It will be a landmark moment come London 2012 when for the first time every sport will have women participating in it , " she said .
" There are still major disparities in the number of medals women can win compared to men but this is a step in the right direction .
" In this country women 's boxing has come on in leaps and bounds and is growing quickly at all levels .
" London 2012 will now create the first - ever generation of boxing heroines and hopefully inspire even more women to take up the sport . "
Women 's boxing came close to being included at the 2008 Beijing Games but the IOC ruled it would not offer added value to the Olympic programme .
It will give female boxers the chance to showcase their talents on the biggest sporting stage
Sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe
Fears were that the sport was not competitive in enough countries , which could lead to potentially dangerous mismatches .
But participation has since boomed with 120 international federations having female boxers .
There are now nearly 600 registered female boxers in England , up from 50 in 2005 .
Amanda Coulson , a three - time ABA champion and long - time trail - blazer for British women 's amateur boxing , expects the whole sport to benefit from the IOC 's decision .
" It 's fantastic news , I 'm over the moon , " she said .
" Women 's boxing can only progress from here - participation numbers will go through the roof , especially after 2012 .
" The sport will keep growing but not just female boxing , the numbers overall will increase because of the added exposure . "
England women 's coach Mick Gannon expects the popularity of female boxing to explode following its inclusion in the Olympics .
" It 's fantastic , " he said .
" What we 'll see now is young ladies knocking down the doors at boxing gyms .

" There is going to be a big jump from other combat sports into boxing and it is already the fastest - growing sport in England .
" Numbers - wise it has increased by about 700 % in five or six years .
" Like any sport you have a drop - off but now they will have the opportunity to go on and become superstars . "
British sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe added : " This move is a massive boost for women 's boxing .
" It will give female boxers the chance to showcase their talents on the biggest sporting stage .
" I am sure that our British talent will relish the opportunity to compete in front of a home crowd in 2012 and will help raise the profile of women 's boxing at all levels . "
606 : DEBATE
The move was criticised by the British Medical Association , which represents more than 140,000 doctors and medical students .
A BMA spokesman said the sport should " play no part in a modern Olympic games " .
He added : " Irrespective of their gender , during the course of a fight boxers can suffer acute brain haemorrhage and serious damage to their eyes , ears and nose .
" Throughout their career , boxers will receive thousands of blows to the head .
Each blow received results in the brain being shaken within the skull .
" The cumulative affect of a lifetime in the ring can be irreversible brain damage .
Unlike other sports the aim of boxing is to inflict bodily harm on an opponent . "

Former boxer and Labour MP Paul Flynn described the decision as " foolish " and said it was not a step forward for female equality .
The politician , who has tabled two private members ' bills to get boxing banned , said : " This is a foolish act .
I 'm very disappointed to see it 's being presented as something to do with women 's rights . "
He added : " If anyone still believes boxing is a healthy sport there 's two words for them - Muhammad Ali . "
British boxer Amir Khan , an Olympic silver medallist in 2004 , said : " Deep down I think women should n't fight .
That 's my opinion .
" When you get hit it 's very painful .
Women can get knocked out . "
However , he told BBC Radio 5 live : " I am going to be supportive .
I 'll be cheering on the British fighters and hoping they win the medals . "
Although the head is not a target zone in amateur boxing , one organisation expressed concern at further promoting the sport of boxing as a whole .
Peter McCabe , chief executive of brain injury association Headway , said : " We believe all forms of boxing should be banned with immediate effect .
I have seen at first hand the massive improvements that have taken place in competitive women 's amateur boxing over the last few years ,
Richie Woodhall
Former world boxing champion " Introducing women 's boxing at the Olympics will simply serve to glamorise a dangerous and irresponsible sport to a new audience and lead to more young women putting their health at risk . "
Khan admitted he had never seen a women 's fight , whereas former WBC super - middleweight world champion Richie Woodhall , now a coaching consultant to the British Amateur Boxing Association , says the change is deserved .
" I have seen at first hand the massive improvements that have taken place in competitive women 's amateur boxing over the last few years , " he said .
Sue Tibballs , chief executive of the Women 's Sport and Fitness Foundation , welcomed the shift towards equality at the Olympics .
" In Beijing , 165 medals were available to men versus 127 to women , " she said .
" Women were first allowed to compete in the Olympic stadium in 1922 - 90 years on , we hope London 2012 will show real progress for sportswomen . "
In all , 17 sports submitted applications for changes to their programmes .
Among them : Canoe sprint - all men's 500 m events will be shortened to 200 m to make them " more spectacular " ; men 's canoe double 500 m to be replaced by women 's kayak single ( K1 ) 200 m .
Handball - all placement matches below the bronze - medal play - off will be removed .
Modern pentathlon - the new combined run / shoot format has been included .
Tennis - a mixed doubles event will be included , subject to confirmation from the International Tennis Federation that top singles players will take part .
Wrestling , Swimming , Cycling - all want new events , which will be allowed only if they replace current events and do not increase the number of athletes .
Sailing - Tornado Multihull event withdrawn , reducing the programme to 10 events .
Final decisions on details will be made at the IOC executive board 's December meeting in Lausanne .

id : koki-hさんの 「 Rubyist九州7月定例会での発表内容」は，2つの意味で興味深いものでした。
ひとつは ，Rubyを題材にしているということ。もうひとつは，フィジカルコンピューティングを扱っていることです。恥ずかしながら掲載されているスライドでフィジカルコンピューティングという言葉を初めて知ったのですが，現在，制御という学科名がつく学校で働いていることから非常に興味を持ちました。
まず，手始め に 「 Arduinoで何でも制御」の連載を始めから読んでみたいのですが，第1回を読んだあと，第2回を探すのが大変です。ということで，自分でまとめサイトを作ってみました。id:koki-hさんのモノマネです(^^ ) 。

East Germany 's Helmut Newton Olaf Martens and Sexual Anarchy in the GDR
Photographer Olaf Martens was described as East Germany 's answer to Helmut Newton , the West German internationally renowned for his fashion and nude photography .
Martens talks about how he shot his nudes , how East Germans were more sexually adventurous and why he does n't like being compared to Newton .
Over at the Activision booth , they demoed DJ Hero .
Not knowing anything about the game except for the turntable , I was impressed .
I ’m a big fan of music mash - ups like Linkin Park and Jay - Z ’s Collision Course ( do n’t judge me ) .
So , a game with this type of music , instantly got my attention .
At first , the scratching and switch of the tracks using the crossfader got me confused .
But just like any new game , it just takes some time and practice to get used to it .
In the second part of the video , you ’ll see that if you have a Guitar Hero guitar controller , you can also use that for 2 player fun .
But there is only 10 special tracks you can play with both the Guitar Hero guitar and the DJ hero turntable .
DJ Hero release September 30th , 2009 .
On Friday , three banks failed and the FDIC took them over .
Now this is n’t the big news necessarily .
What it significant is that one of the banks taken over was Silverton Bank of Atlanta , Georgia .
Silverton bank has $ 4.1 billion in assets and will cost the FDIC $ 1.3 billion from their dwindling insurance fund .
This will be the costliest bank takeover since U.S. Bank took over Downey Savings and Loan in November of 2008 for a cost of $ 1.4 billion to the FDIC Insurance Fund .
So how much is left in the fund ?
Not much .
In fact , if we throw in Citigroup and Bank of America , two banks that have failed without government support and massive intervention , the fund would be broke .
But let us set those two banks aside and start running the numbers .
As of December 31 , 2008 the FDIC fund had $ 18.9 billion in it .
Already in 2009 we have seen 32 bank failures , above the 25 bank failures for all of 2008 .
And with commercial real estate and residential real estate still facing record foreclosures , we can expect that more money will be drained from the fund .
Now most of the times , you will get bank failures that cost a few million but every once in awhile you ’ll get a moderate sized bank like Silverton that will cost the fund $ 1.3 billion .
Let us first take a tally of the 2009 bank failures :
Looking at the list above , you can see that only 2 of 32 bank failures of 2009 actually cost the fund more than $ 500 million .
Silverton by itself took out the same amount from the FDIC fund as the first 11 bank failures of 2009 .
In the age of mega banks , we are no longer in a depression era local banking system where bank failures impacted the immediate community .
Our banking system is now interconnected that a bank failure in Georgia with Silverton 1,400 client banks in 44 states and has six regional offices impacts a larger geographic area .
Many people never heard anything about Silverton until this Friday .
Let us refer to the 32 bank failure list I put together from the FDIC again .
So far in 2009 , the total estimated cost to the FDIC ’s fund is going to be $ 5.3 billion :
$ 18.9 billion in fund as of ( Dec , 31 ) – $ 5.3 billion in 2009 bank failures = $ 13.6 billion left
And many of you may remember the failure of IndyMac bank back in July of 2008 .
When IndyMac was taken over by the FDIC it had $ 32 billion in total assets being managed .
Initially the FDIC had an estimate that the cost to the fund would be anywhere from $ 4 to $ 8 billion .
A sizeable number .
Well after many months , this information was released on March 19 , 2009 :
“ IndyMac Federal sustained losses of $ 2.6 billion in the fourth quarter 2008 due to deterioration in the real estate market .
The total estimated loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund is $ 10.7 billion .
No further payments on receivership claims for uninsured funds from former IndyMac Bank , F.S.B. will be distributed as a result of this transaction . ”
Talk about missing on your estimate .
It went from a lower end estimate of $ 4 billion to a finalized cost to the fund of $ 10.7 billion .
Of course IndyMac was heavily reliant on one of the largest real estate bubble economies here in California .
But with only $ 13.6 billion ( estimate , could be lower ) the fund would be virtually exhausted with one more IndyMac size failure .
The FDIC already has its hands full trying to deal with the public - private investment program that will put them in the business of putting out non-recourse loans for the U.S. Treasury ’s toxic asset program .
The fund initially will have $ 500 billion in loans to make available .
Of course , this program is still in the works and is a major rip off to taxpayers .
If the majority of the public understood the details of the program , they would be out in the streets protesting right now .
With approximately $ 13.6 billion left in the Deposit Insurance Fund ( DIF ) , the FDIC realizes that it will be emptied out in 2009 .
That is why they have been lobbying for more money to be allocated to the actual fund .
They ’ve won concessions such as raising the deposit limit to $ 250,000 per individual account .
Much of this was probably spurred by the failure of IndyMac where many clients had over $ 100,000 in accounts .
The government did n’t want anymore photo ops of people standing in lines outside of banks ala the Great Depression in 2008 .
The FDIC with their 4th quarter report of 2008 , stated that FDIC - insured institutions reported a net loss of $ 32.1 billion which was the first quarterly loss since 1990 .
Even though we all know that most of the nation ’s banking is in a monopoly with the 19 large banks , there is still trillions not owned by these big banks .
Here is the data :
- The FDIC insures more than $ 4.7 trillion in deposits
- 8,300 U.S. Banks and thrifts
- In 75 - year history , not one penny in insured deposits has been lost
- 4,900 person staff ( and growing )
Now of course , the operative word is with insured deposits .
So if you put your money in a mutual fund with Bank of America , that money is n’t protected from the shellacking the market took in the last year so make sure you know what is covered and what is n’t .
There is all the reason to believe that the 8,300 banks and thrifts are going to see continued pain in 2009 .
In fact , troubled loans keep on increasing :
And of course , the DIF is facing a declining amount which is putting pressure on the coverage ratio :
The bottom line with the FDIC is that the Deposit Insurance Fund will be exhausted in 2009 .
The fact that the FDIC will be intimately involved in making non-recourse loans with the public - private investment program tells us this agency is where much of the money is going to be floating through .
It is time for the FDIC to gear up and make sure that one government agency does their due diligence and protects taxpayer ’s money .
It is our last line of financial defense at this point .

I became involved with Abdelbaset Ali al - Megrahi quite by accident .
Like many people I had been suffering from Lockerbie fatigue .
For me , and for you , I suppose , life had moved on from that horrendous crime over 20 years ago and the imprisonment of the Libyan murderer .
That was that .
At least it was , until I agreed , by chance , to sponsor the showing of a Dutch documentary about the Lockerbie bombing at Parliament .
I invited all MSPs and researchers , and indeed the press corps , to see this film .
One MSP and one member of the press came , and I really only saw it because I felt obliged to attend .
But that film changed my perspective .
From that casual moment , and from much that I have learned since , I am convinced not only that Megrahi was not found guilty " beyond reasonable doubt " , the test in Scot 's law , but that he is an innocent man .
He is not a saint , of course – he had a history with Libyan intelligence – but his hands are clean over Lockerbie .
For you should recall that five months before the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 on that dark , wild December night just before Christmas in 1988 , an American military cruiser , the Vincennes , shot down an Iranian passenger plane carrying 290 pilgrims .
No one has been charged , let alone prosecuted , over that , even though it was all captured on film .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
It is reasonable to deduce that when an American plane carrying , as some believed , military personnel back home to their religious festival , is blasted out of the sky , the finger of suspicion should not point first at Libya .
Iran , maybe .
However , Iran had to be kept on side because of the Iraq / Kuwait conflict .
The Iran / Syria connection was soon dropped , and so Libya was indeed blamed .
Here was a credible culprit .
To successfully frame a nation , pick one like Libya , in which all the baddies of the Middle East are personified in a recognisable hate figure like Gadhafi .
If you want to frame a man , pick one with a feasible track record .
Then first sell it to the world through the press and , hey presto !
But back to that film , which has not yet been seen here .
After watching this disconcerting documentary , which challenged the reliability of key evidence , I got into conversations that night with Dr Jim Swire , with a forensic police scientist who had to label those bodies scattered across hundreds of acres of dark wintry hillside , with Father Patrick Keegan , the priest who lived in Sherwood Crescent ( the only person who survived in that street ) and with others .
None of them supported the case against al - Megrahi .
Since then I have met the man at the centre of it all on several occasions .
Our first meeting took place on a blustery morning some months ago .
Afterwards I was confronted by a crowd of reporters who waited until I emerged one hour later from speaking to a man so detested , so reviled by many that death in prison from cancer would be too good for him .
He was sitting in front of a laptop , across the table in a room set aside of lawyers and their clients .
His English was excellent and I remember trying to impress upon him that I was there for the duration , and not just this one visit .
I told him that if I thought for one minute he was guilty I would walk out of the room .
But he was intent on scrolling through the pages of the trial , pausing now and then to emphasise a point .
Perhaps he was listening .
On subsequent visits we could go straight to the point , and deal with " prisoner transfer " : to qualify he would have to abandon the appeal which could allow him to clear his name .
We also talked more of his family and the growing need , as his health worsened , as it clearly was doing , to be with them .
It was then that his composure was momentarily lost ; the emotion and tension were tangible .
But although his priority was to be with them in his last days , he told me he did not want his name to go down in history as the Lockerbie bomber .
He told me , in short , that he did not do it .
I told him again that I thought he was innocent .
Let me make one thing clear : I understand the hatred some feel for him , particularly the US relatives of the dead .
It is , however , misplaced and it is in order to unravel for them the true story of Lockerbie , as much as to liberate an innocent man , that I and others worked hard for his compassionate release .
This would have allowed the appeal process to be exhausted and evidence - led .
The Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission considered there was evidence vital enough for it to consider that there might have been a miscarriage of justice .
That evidence , particularly relating to the identification of al - Megrahi linking him directly to the bombing has never and will now never be tested in a Scottish court .
My final meeting with him was on 23 July .
He requested that it be private and I have kept my word till now .
Apart from discussing his deteriorating health , increasing frailty and his family , we discussed at length his compassionate release .
He wanted my advice .
I told him I thought he had nothing to lose because if it was rejected he could abandon his appeal and take the prisoner transfer route .
I advised him to consult his legal team .
The next day he applied for compassionate release .
Stupidly , I thought there was a good chance that after his death at home his appeal could still be pursued , by his family .
But , like al - Megrahi , I am a tiny cog in an elaborate mechanism .
Last week he abandoned his appeal .
His counsel advised the court that he believed that to do so would " assist " with his " applications " .
The previous week I had received an email from a whistleblower in the Justice Department telling me that the Libyan officials were being told in no uncertain terms that he must drop his appeal or there would be no compassionate release .
Al - Megrahi was a desperate man , but I believe there are other desperate men and women – in the US Justice Department and in Whitehall , – all with their own reasons for wanting that appeal to be ditched .
Now he is home , but he is still , officially , a guilty man .
Those who believe him guilty are crying foul .
So are those of us who believe him innocent .
And then there are those who are happily sipping their claret , their eyes on a comfortable unblemished retirement .
As for any inquiry , that 's out there in the long grass .
They are people in authority who are relying on Lockerbie fatigue setting in again .
It must n't .

Online chat rooms have been aghast and amused at the choice A marketing blunder in Nigeria has got online communities all of a twitter , after a joint oil and gas venture with Russia was named Nigaz .
Russia 's Gazprom and Nigeria 's state - operated NNPC formed the company - pronounced " nye - gaz " - last week .
Nigerians No Nigaz , a group formed on the social networking site Facebook , says the name could be pronounced in a way offensive to black people .
Users of Twitter have also expressed disbelief at the decision .
" Russian & Nigerian companies have formed new oil firm called ... Nigaz .
I 'm not lying , " says Osa Oyegun , under her Twitter name ChocolateMezzo .
The topic has prompted hundreds of tweets .
Henry Makiwa , known as makiwahenry , said : " Lol [ laugh out loud ] of the day : Russian / Nigerian oil conglomerate has had PR branding blunder after naming joint company ' Nigaz ' . "
' Bright moment ' Correspondents say despite the hoo - ha caused online , newspapers in Nigeria have not picked up on the story yet .
The fact is that whenever there is a blunder like this it delights people , it gives them something to talk about
Branding consultant Simon Anholt
Is ' Nigaz ' offensive ?
Have your say Simon Anholt , a top branding consultant who developed the National Brands Index , says this may be because such faux pas are usually " harmless " .
" The fact is that whenever there is a blunder like this it delights people , it gives them something to talk about and it gives them a bright moment in what might otherwise be a dull day , " he told the BBC Network Africa programme .
He admitted that it could be seen as offensive , but said it was fairly uncommon for companies to change their names .
Such blunders are more common in government - run organisations , he said , " because they simply do n't have the marketing experience to check these things out properly " .
But he says the fuss is likely to die down .
" People will soon forget that the name sounds bad , " he says .

Sheppard and Whittle tried to claim political asylum in Los Angeles
They looked like a pair of cranks straight out of a Louis Theroux documentary .
One was an unrepentant woman hater whose racist and anti-Semitic views were too hard - line even for the British National Party .
The other , his long - haired sidekick , sought the protection of a pseudonym that he used to make extremist rants .
Their hunger to stir up controversy saw them flee from justice in the north of England and stage an unlikely claim for political asylum in Los Angeles .
But their journey has now ended with jail sentences in the UK .
Jurors at Leeds Crown Court decided neo -Nazis Simon Sheppard and Stephen Whittle were not just harmless oddballs , but dangerous propagandists dedicated to whipping up racism .
On Friday , Sheppard was jailed for four years , 10 months and Whittle for two years , four months .
In a landmark case , they have become the first Britons to be convicted of inciting racial hatred via a foreign website , having printed leaflets and controlled websites in the US featuring racist material .
' Obnoxious and abhorrent '
The court heard the investigation into the pair began when a complaint about an anti-Semitic comic book called Tales of the Holohoax was made to the police in 2004 after it was pushed through the door of a synagogue in Blackpool , Lancashire .
It was traced back to a post office box in Hull registered to Sheppard , 51 , a former BNP organiser kicked out of the far - right party after he was jailed in 2000 for distributing a racially inflammatory election leaflet .
The spotlight fell on the publishing activities of Sheppard , of Selby , North Yorkshire , a self - styled " scientific publisher " , whose online ramblings took in a hatred of women and a morbid fixation with cannibalism .
But a police investigation discovered that his prime motivation was racism and he dedicated himself to producing what prosecutors called " obnoxious and abhorrent ' ' books , pamphlets and web pages .
What they are not entitled to do is to publish or distribute those opinions to the public in a threatening , abusive or insulting manner either intending to stir up racial hatred or in circumstances where it is likely racial hatred will be stirred up
Mari Reid , CPS Counter Terrorism Division
On his website , Sheppard employed Whittle , 42 , of Preston , Lancashire , as a columnist under the pseudonym " Luke O'Farrell " .
Although their vitriol was variously directed at black , Asian and other non-white people , most of the material shown to the jury was virulently anti-Semitic .
The language and racial slurs used by the pair cannot be repeated here , but some of the excerpts presented to the court offered a flavour of their discourse .
One leaflet claimed that Auschwitz had not really been the location of industrial mass murder but had been , instead , a holiday camp provided by a benevolent Nazi regime for Europe 's Jewish population .
Jonathan Sandiford , prosecuting , told the jury that it held up survivors of the Holocaust to " ridicule and contempt " , accusing them of lying about the genocide of six million Jews .
Another story was illustrated with photographs of dead Jews .
Sheppard also wrote that Holocaust victim Anne Frank 's diary was " evil " .
Reviewing lawyer Mari Reid , of the Crown Prosecution Service 's counter - terrorism division , said members of the public were entitled under the law to hold racist and extreme views .
But she added : " What they are not entitled to do is to publish or distribute those opinions to the public in a threatening , abusive or insulting manner either intending to stir up racial hatred or in circumstances where it is likely racial hatred will be stirred up . "
Thrown out
The defence argued that the online material did not fall under the jurisdiction of UK law , because Sheppard 's site was hosted on servers in California .
But in a landmark ruling , the judge dismissed this - potentially paving the way for further prosecutions against the owners of other hate sites who believe they are exploiting a legal loophole .
Jurors , too , rejected the defence 's claim that the pair 's writings were merely satirical .
Sheppard was found guilty of 11 offences and Whittle was found guilty of five offences in July 2008 .
Sheppard was found guilty of a further five charges in January 2009 .
But the pair were not in court to hear the verdicts against them .
Before the jury in the first trial could return verdicts , both men fled to Los Angeles International airport and attempted to claim political asylum .
But their bid was thrown out by an immigration judge , and they were held at Santa Ana prison in California until they were returned to the UK to serve their sentences .
The irony of two racists attempting to exploit the immigration and asylum system was lost on no -one who followed the case .

The company was aware that its lineup was far too limited .
And Cerberus sent Chrysler executives around the world to seek partnerships with foreign automakers like Nissan .
The hope was that those companies would help provide a broader product line for dealers .
But there was not time for any of the efforts to bear fruit .
Chrysler was burning through cash .
“ Once the car market stalled , the cash in the auto market evaporated , ” says Maryann Keller , a longtime auto analyst and consultant , of Chrysler ’s predicament .
“ The cash was leaving their balance sheet , and they were n’t selling cars to make money they could invest . ”
That situation was made worse by hefty interest payments on more than $ 10 billion in debt that Cerberus arranged for Chrysler as part of the takeover , which left the automaker carrying piles of debt just as auto sales were about to plummet .
While many private equity deals involved saddling companies with debt to pay off investors , Chrysler needed to take on more debt because it had so little cash on hand to finance its operations , some analysts say .
The company paid back some of the debt in November 2007 .
Ms. Keller says that the company that Mr. Feinberg took over was already suffering from myriad problems : a bad cost structure , a limited product line and no pipeline of more diverse offerings .
In short , she says , Cerberus had simply bought “ a basket case . ”
At the beginning of 2008 , Mr. Feinberg sized up his investment in a private letter to his investors .
“ We do not need to be heroes to earn a good return on the investment in Chrysler , ” he wrote .
“ We do not need to transition the car industry or even to return Chrysler to a much stronger relative position in the U.S. car market in order to be successful . ”
His letter sent a chill around New York , where dozens of hedge funds had joined in his Chrysler bet .
Although these firms had agreed to let Cerberus control decisions involving their investments , there was fear about how his harsh words might affect the industry ’s image .
After all , such a steely , hard - headed look at Chrysler did n’t mesh with the patriotic tone of Cerberus ’s other statements about the company .
Nor did it comport with the private equity industry ’s broader arguments that its investments were good not only for its firms , but also for America .
Cerberus , meanwhile , was unable to stop Chrysler ’s downward spiral .
Last fall , Chrysler and General Motors tried to merge their operations , a scenario Mr. Feinberg supported , but a deal could not be struck .
And in November , Chrysler announced a huge employee buyout .
Mr. Johnson , the worker at the Toledo plant , joined thousands of others who signed up .
The mother of computer hacker Gary McKinnon made an impassioned appeal to US president Barack Obama today after her son failed in his latest High Court bid to avoid extradition to America .
The 43 - year - old , who suffers from Asperger 's Syndrome ( AS ) , is wanted for trial on charges of hacking into US military networks .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
His mother , Janis Sharp , has expressed fears that he could face a 60 - year sentence in a tough US jail and would be at real risk of suicide because of his medical condition .
She also fears she would never see him again .
Today Lord Justice Stanley Burnton and Mr Justice Wilkie ruled extradition was " a lawful and proportionate response " to Mr McKinnon 's offending , and said the Home Secretary was entitled to accept US assurances that he would receive " appropriate care " in America .
After the judgment , Home Secretary Alan Johnson made clear that he has no plans to stop Mr McKinnon 's removal .
He said : " It would be illegal for me to stop the extradition of Gary McKinnon , which the court ruling has made clear .
" Mr McKinnon is accused of serious crimes and the US has a lawful right to seek his extradition , as we do when we wish to prosecute people who break our laws .
" He is accused of hacking into 97 US Army , Navy , Nasa and Defense Department computers concerned with national defence and security at a critical time immediately following the 9/11 attacks and leaving the military network vulnerable to intruders .
" The court judgment has also made absolutely clear that the DPP 's decision not to prosecute in the UK was the right one .

" My predecessor has already sought and received clear assurances from the US that Mr McKinnon 's health and welfare needs would be met , should he be extradited . "
But immediately after the " heartbreaking " High Court ruling , Mrs Sharp made a dramatic , desperate appeal to Mr Obama to halt her son's removal as she stood on the steps of the Royal Courts of Justice in London .
Directly addressing Mr Obama , she said : " Stand by us and make this world a better place , a more compassionate place . "
She added : " Obama would n't have this .
He does n't want the first guy extradited for computer misuse to be a guy with Asperger 's , a UFO guy .
He would n't want this .
" I 'm just praying , please hear us , Obama , because I know you would do the right thing .
" I know you would have the strength to stand up and not have this . "
Mr McKinnon 's solicitor , Karen Todner , said she would lodge an appeal against the High Court 's decision within 28 days and , if possible , take it to the UK's new Supreme Court and even to Europe .
A letter has been sent to the US president signed by 40 British MPs asking him to step in and " bring this shameful episode to an end " .
Lawyers for Mr McKinnon , who was told the decision yesterday , described him as a " UFO eccentric " who had been searching for evidence of extra- terrestrial life , and described the idea that he was a danger to US national security as " a complete fantasy " .
The US authorities said Mr McKinnon was responsible for the " biggest military hack of all time " that had been highly damaging .
A campaign involving family , politicians , civil rights groups , sympathetic media and celebrities has supported the hacker 's long battle against extradition .
[ The following is an exact transcript of this podcast . ]
As we recover from the holiday weekend , there ’s some intoxicating news on curbing the effects of alcohol .
In the May 29th issue of Cell , scientists report discovering a gene that controls fruit flies ’ sensitivity to ethanol .
And if that just sounds like tipsytalk , the finding suggests that a couple of current anticancer drugs might find use in treating alcoholism .
Some flies , like some people , just ca n’t hold their drink .
One sip and they ’re tripping over their own wings .
So the scientists set out to search for the fly genes involved in alcohol sensitivity .
And they turned up a gene they call happyhour .
Flies with a normal version of this gene are liquor light - weights , while happyhour mutants can drink their fly friends under the table .
In the normal flies , happyhour blocks a hormone called EGF .
And the scientists found that two anticancer drugs , which also inhibit EGF , make boozing flies more woozy — a feeling that ’s as unpleasant for flies as it is for people .
Rats , too , will take a nip and say enough when they ’re on these drugs .
Robbing booze of its buzz is one way to attack alcoholism .
Which means that , at least genetically speaking , it ’s good to have a little happyhour .

GNU Guile 1.9.0 released ( alpha )
From : Ludovic Courtès Subject : GNU Guile 1.9.0 released ( alpha ) Date : Sat , 20 Jun 2009 00:05:21 +0200 User-agent : Gnus / 5.13 ( Gnus v5.13 ) Emacs /23.0.91 ( gnu/linux )
We are pleased to announce GNU Guile release 1.9.0 .
This is the first pre-release of what will eventually become the 2.0 release series .
It provides many new noteworthy features , most notably the addition of a compiler and virtual machine .
We encourage you to test them and provide feedback to address@hidden ' .
The Guile web page is located at http://gnu.org/software/guile/, and among other things , it contains a link to the Guile FAQ and pointers to the mailing lists .
Guile is an interpreter , compiler , and virtual machine for the Scheme programming language , with support for many SRFIs , packaged for use in a wide variety of environments .
In addition to implementing the R5RS Scheme standard , Guile includes a module system , full access to POSIX system calls , networking support , multiple threads , dynamic linking , a foreign function call interface , and powerful string processing .
Guile can run interactively , as a script interpreter , and as a Scheme compiler to VM bytecode .
It is also packaged as a library so that applications can easily incorporate a complete Scheme interpreter / VM .
An application can use Guile as an extension language , a clean and powerful configuration language , or as multi-purpose " glue " to connect primitives provided by the application .
It is easy to call Scheme code From C code and vice versa .
Applications can add new functions , data types , control structures , and even syntax to Guile , to create a domain - specific language tailored to the task at hand .
Here are the compressed sources : ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/guile/guile-1.9.0.tar.gz ( 4.6MB ) Here are the GPG detached signatures [ * ] : ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/guile/guile-1.9.0.tar.gz.sig
Here are the MD5 and SHA1 checksums : 71c3fa0ed22c91b30e9573478 fdee4dc guile-1.9.0.tar.gz 836cffc2d05cd0de938bf24bc91e9debe8 fea060 guile-1.9.0.tar.gz [*]
You can use either of the above signature files to verify that the corresponding file ( without the .sig suffix ) is intact .
First , be sure to download both the .sig file and the corresponding tarball .
Then , run a command like this : gpg --verify guile - 1.9.0.tar.gz.sig
If that command fails because you do n't have the required public key , then run this command to import it : gpg -- keyserver keys.gnupg.net -- recv-keys EA52ECF4 and rerun the `gpg -- verify ' command .

Article Index Binary Arithmetic Binary is Best Page 1 of 2
What could be simpler than binary arithmetic ?
It ’s just two - fingered counting and , once you know how it works , it seems natural for a computer to use it .
But decimal is so built into our hands that it took quite a long time before we realized that two fingers were enough .
We are so used to counting and doing simple arithmetic that we tend to forget that if you do n’t choose the right system then it all looks very difficult .
We also tend to think that the base ten place value system which is what we normally use is so natural it must be ... well , natural !
Of course it is n't and there are lots of different ways of counting .
To understand the binary system let 's first look at a system with more digits than just 0 and 1 and which used a mixed base .
The duo-decimal system
You might think that using a decimal place value system is so blindingly obvious that only an idiot would use anything else - but it is n’t that long since the UK dropped the mixed base duo-decimal monetary system ,
The duo- decimal system is a good example of a mixed based system .
This counted first in base 12 to get shillings , 12 pence makes one shilling , and then in base 20 to get pounds , 20 shillings makes one pound .
The imperial system of weights and measures still hangs on in both the USA and the UK and it ’s even more eccentric .
For example , weight is counted first to base 16 ( ounces to pounds ) , then base 14 ( pounds to stones ) then base 8 ( stones to cwt ) and then base 20 ( cwt to tons ) !
So much for the attractive simplicity of the base ten place value system !
However this does n’t mean that any old system of numbers works as well as any other .
It has even been suggested that the Romans would have been better engineers if it was n’t for their incredibly complicated mixed - base no -place value system .
Exactly how you count affects how easy it is to perform arithmetic and hence counting matters .
Base and place
So what is a “ place value ” system and how does it work ?
The idea is that you first choose your base and arrange to have just enough symbols , any symbols you like , to count up to one less than this value .
For example , if you choose 3 as the base you need symbols for 0 , 1 , and 2 but you could just as easily use the symbols A , B and C .
The symbols do n't matter but in most cases we pick the traditional digits for values up to nine even though this risks confusion with a decimal system .
Counting in base three leads quickly to a problem common to all counting systems that use a limited number of symbols .
What do you do when you get to 2 and need to count to 3 ?
Remember you only have the symbols 0 , 1 and 2 .
The answer should be familiar to any digit - counting human - you make a group of three , i.e. 1 group of three and nothing extra , which you write down as 10 .
Notice that this is not “ ten ” but “ one zero in base 3 ” .
Then you carry on counting : 11 ( i.e. 1 lot of 3 and 1 ) , 12 ( i.e. 1 lot of 3 and 2 ) and then you reach another group of 3 .
So now you have two groups of 3 which you write down as 20 which is not “ twenty ” but “ two zero in base 3 ” .
You carry on like this until you reach 22 and adding one more makes this into three groups of three which you write 100 , which means that you have one group of three groups of three .
Think of it as a hierarchy in which you build a group of three things each of which is in turn a group of three things and so on .
We could go on labouring this idea all day - but now you either see what is going on or you are totally confused .
If you are confused then go through the same steps with the base you know best , i.e. base 10 , and see what happens .
The place value system
The place value system is a remarkably clever invention because using it you can give a name to any number without the need for an infinite number of symbols .
You can see that you only need n symbols to count in base n , not n- 1 because you also need zero to record no groups of n things .
You need a zero to implement a place value system because you need to indicate a place even if it is empty i.e. zero .
Conventionally we use the digits 0 to 9 for bases up to 10 and the letter of the alphabet for bases greater than ten .
The use of letters is something that makes a number system look very strange and it tends to frighten people but the principles are just the same .
For example , to count in hexadecimal , i.e. base 16 , you need symbols for 0 to 15 , i.e. one less than the base , and these are 0 to 9 , A , B , C , D , E and F . Counting in base 16 starts out exactly like counting base 10 i.e.
0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9 , but you do n’t go to ten next because you are counting in base 16 and you only move to the next place value when you have a group of 16 to notch up .
Instead you use A for ten , B for eleven and so on until you reach F for 15 .
Add one more and you have a group of 16 which you write down as 10 - again not “ ten ” but “ one zero in base 16 ” .
The rest is just more of the same but it still looks odd to refer to “ FF ” as a number - 255 to be exact - because that ’s what 15 groups of 16 plus one group of 15 add up to .
Base Arithmetic
You can count in any base you care to select .
You can even use a mixed base if you want to .
Just recall the examples listed earlier of money , weights and measures and what about counting the days in a year ?
In this case we do n't even stick to a single base for the first place value as a month as 28 , 30 or 31 days .
Thinking about these examples and you will quickly understand what mixed base counting is all about .
What might surprise you a little more is that it is even possible to include negative numbers in a mixed base and it has some practical applications - but that ’s another , and slightly esoteric , story !
What is also important about a place value system , any place value system , is that it makes the algorithms of arithmetic very simple .
You may not be aware that there is anything so difficult about arithmetic that it needs anything as dignified as an “ algorithm ” but that ’s just because you ’re not a Roman .
As I suggested earlier , doing arithmetic using Roman numerals is a big problem .
You can just about manage addition but multiplication and division are next to impossible - try and figure out how to do IX times IIIV as a algorithm that does n't first convert to decimal or any other place value system .
The place value algorithms allow you to work out a sum by processing each pair of digits in turn and handling “ carries ” to the next place .
What is interesting is that the algorithms are the same no matter what base you are working in - as long as you remember to stay in the original base as you work .
For example , if you want to add 22 to 21 in base three you would add the first , i.e. lowest order , digits , 2+1 to get the result 10 .
If you added them and got 3 then you are forgetting to stay within the base that you are working in !
So the result of adding the first two digits is 0 carry 1 .
Adding the next two digits .
i.e. the high order , 2+2 gives the result 11 and adding the carry gives 12 .
The final answer to 22+21 is 120 - in base three .
The general idea is that you add the symbols up in each position and then carry any result that is too big into the next positions addition .
This means you only need to know how to add the basic symbols of the number system and you can then add any pair of numbers .

They told me the name of the big black rescued lab was Reggie as I looked at him lying in his pen .
The shelter was clean , no -kill , and the people really friendly .
I ’d only been in the area for six months , but everywhere I went in the small college town , people were welcoming and open .
Everyone waves when you pass them on the street .
But something was still missing as I attempted to settle in to my new life here , and I thought a dog could n’t hurt .
Give me someone to talk to .
And I had just seen Reggie ’s advertisement on the local news .
The shelter said they had received numerous calls right after , but they said the people who had come down to see him just did n’t look like “ Lab people , ” whatever that meant .
They must ’ve thought I did .
But at first , I thought the shelter had misjudged me in giving me Reggie and his things , which consisted of a dog pad , bag of toys … almost all of which were brand new tennis balls , his dishes , and a sealed letter from his previous owner .
See , Reggie and I did n’t really hit it off when we got home .
We struggled for two weeks ( which is how long the shelter told me to give him to adjust to his new home ) .
Maybe it was the fact that I was trying to adjust , too .
Maybe we were too much alike .
For some reason , his stuff ( except for the tennis balls – he would n’t go anywhere without two tennis balls stuffed in his mouth ) got tossed in with all of my other unpacked boxes .
I guess I did n’t really think he ’d need all his old stuff , that I ’d get him new things once he settled in .
But it became pretty clear pretty soon that he was n’t going to .
I tried the normal commands the shelter told me he knew , ones like “ sit ” and “ stay ” and “ come ” and “ heel , ” and he ’d follow them – when he felt like it .
He never really seemed to listen when I called his name – sure , he ’d look in my direction after the fourth of fifth time I said it , but then he ’d just go back to doing whatever , still carrying those stupid tennis balls .
When I ’d ask again , you could almost see him sigh and then grudgingly obey .
This just was n’t going to work .
He chewed a couple shoes and some unpacked boxes .
I was a little too stern with him and he resented it , I could tell .
The friction got so bad that I could n’t wait for the two weeks to be up , and when it was , I was in full - on search mode for my cellphone amid all of my unpacked stuff .
I remembered leaving it on the stack of boxes for the guest room , but I also mumbled , rather cynically , that the “ damn dog probably hid it on me . ”
Finally I found it , but before I could punch up the shelter ’s number , I also found his pad and other toys from the shelter …
I tossed the pad in Reggie ’s direction and he snuffed it and wagged , some of the most enthusiasm I ’d seen since bringing him home .
But then I called , “ Hey , Reggie , you like that ?
Come here and I ’ll give you a treat . ”
Instead , he sort of glanced in my direction – maybe “ glared ” is more accurate – and then gave a discontented sigh and flopped down .
With his back to me .
Well , that ’s not going to do it either , I thought .
And I punched the shelter phone number .
But I hung up when I saw the sealed envelope .
I had completely forgotten about that , too .
“ Okay , Reggie , ” I said out loud , “ let ’s see if your previous owner has any advice , ” a letter that the shelter said could only be opened by Reggie ’s new owner .
~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
Whoever Gets My Dog :
Well , I ca n’t say that I ’m happy you ’re reading this ,
I ’m not even happy writing it .
If you ’re reading this , it means I just got back from my last car ride with my Lab after dropping him off at the shelter .
He knew something was different .
I have packed up his pad and toys before and set them by the back door before a trip , but this time … it ’s like he knew something was wrong .
And something is wrong … which is why I have to go to try to make it right .
So let me tell you about my Lab in the hopes that it will help you bond with him and he with you .
First , he loves tennis balls .
the more the merrier .
Sometimes I think he ’s part squirrel , the way he hordes them .
He usually always has two in his mouth , and he tries to get a third in there .
Has n’t done it yet .
Does n’t matter where you throw them , he ’ll bound after it , so be careful – really do n’t do it by any roads .
I made that mistake once , and it almost cost him dearly .
Next , commands .
Maybe the shelter staff already told you , but I ’ll go over them again : Reggie knows the obvious ones – “ sit , ” “ stay , ” “ come , ” “ heel . ”
He knows hand signals : “ back ” to turn around and go back when you put your hand straight up ; and “ over ” if you put your hand out right or left .
“ Shake ” for shaking water off , and “ paw ” for a high - five .
He does “ down ” when he feels like lying down – I bet you could work on that with him some more .
He knows “ ball ” and “ food ” and “ bone ” and “ treat ” like nobody ’s business .
I trained Reggie with small food treats .
Nothing opens his ears like little pieces of hot dog .
Feeding schedule : twice a day , once about seven in the morning , and again at six in the evening .
Regular store - bought stuff ; the shelter has the brand .
He ’s up on his shots .
Call the clinic on 9th Street and update his info with yours ; they ’ll make sure to send you reminders for when he ’s due .
Be forewarned : Reggie hates the vet .
Good luck getting him in the car – I do n’t know how he knows when it ’s time to go to the vet , but he knows .
Finally , give him some time .
I ’ve never been married , so it ’s only been Reggie and me for his whole life .
He ’s gone everywhere with me , so please include him on your daily car rides if you can .
He sits well in the backseat , and he does n’t bark or complain .
He just loves to be around people , and me most especially .
Which means that this transition is going to be hard , with him going to live with someone new .
And that ’s why I need to share one more bit of info with you ….
His name ’s not Reggie .
I do n’t know what made me do it , but when I dropped him off at the shelter , I told them his name was Reggie .
He ’s a smart dog , he ’ll get used to it and will respond to it , of that I have no doubt .
but I just could n’t bear to give them his real name .
For me to do that , it seemed so final , that handing him over to the shelter was as good as me admitting that I ’d never see him again .
And if I end up coming back , getting him , and tearing up this letter , it means everything ’s fine .
But if someone else is reading it , well … well it means that his new owner should know his real name .
It ’ll help you bond with him .
Who knows , maybe you ’ll even notice a change in his demeanor if he ’s been giving you problems .
His real name is Tank .
Because that is what I drive .
Again , if you ’re reading this and you ’re from the area , maybe my name has been on the news .
I told the shelter that they could n’t make “ Reggie ” available for adoption until they received word from my company commander .
See , my parents are gone , I have no siblings … there is no one I could ’ve left Tank with .
It was my only real request of the Army upon my deployment to Iraq , that they make one phone call the the shelter … in the “ event ” … to tell them that Tank could be put up for adoption .
Luckily , my colonel is a dog guy , too , and he knew where my platoon was headed .
He said he ’d do it personally .
And if you ’re reading this , then he made good on his word .
Well , this letter is getting to downright depressing , even though , frankly , I ’m just writing it for my dog .
I could n’t imagine if I was writing it for a wife and kids and family .
But still , Tank has been my family for the last six years , almost as long as the Army has been my family .
And now I hope and pray that you make him part of your family and that he will adjust and come to love you the same way he loved me .
That unconditional love from a dog is what I took with me to Iraq as an inspiration to do something selfless , to protect innocent people from those who would do terrible things … and to keep those terrible people from coming over here .
If I had to give up Tank in order to do it , I am glad to have done so .
He was my example of service and of love .
I hope I honored him by my service to my country and comrades .
All right , that ’s enough .
I deploy this evening and have to drop this letter off at the shelter .
I do n’t think I ’ll say another good - bye to Tank , though .
I cried too much the first time .
Maybe I ’ll peek in on him and see if he finally got that third tennis ball in his mouth .
Good luck with Tank .
Give him a good home , and give him an extra kiss goodnight – every night – from me .
Thank you , Paul Mallory
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
I folded the letter and slipped it back in the envelope .
Sure I had heard of Paul Mallory , everyone in town knew him , even new people like me .
Local kid , killed in Iraq a few months ago and posthumously earning the Silver Star when he gave his life to save three buddies .
Flags had been at half - mast all summer .
I leaned forward in my chair and rested my elbows on my knees , staring at the dog .
“ Hey , Tank , ” I said quietly .
The dog ’s head whipped up , his ears cocked and his eyes bright .
“ C’mere boy . ”
He was instantly on his feet , his nails clicking on the hardwood floor .
He sat in front of me , his head tilted , searching for the name he had n’t heard in months .
“ Tank , ” I whispered .
His tail swished .
I kept whispering his name , over and over , and each time , his ears lowered , his eyes softened , and his posture relaxed as a wave of contentment just seemed to flood him .
I stroked his ears , rubbed his shoulders , buried my face into his scruff and hugged him .
“ It ’s me now , Tank , just you and me .
Your old pal gave you to me . ”
Tank reached up and licked my cheek .
“ So whatdaya say we play some ball ?
His ears perked again .
“ Yeah ?
Ball ?
You like that ?
Ball ? ”
Tank tore from my hands and disappeared in the next room .
And when he came back , he had three tennis balls in
his mouth …..
We at WayCoolDogs gives thanks to the Weston County Humane Society for submitting this unique story of the rescued lab and his three tennis balls , hoping it will help a rescued animal somewhere while opening the eyes and heart of its new owner .
We have had several emails from readers saying “ But … but …this story is n’t truuuueeeee !
It ’s only fiction ! ”
We realize this story is untrue but it really does not matter , does it .
The circumstances are real and should be used as a a tool to wake people up in a world where people change dogs like wore - out shoes .
The message in the story is about shelters and their rescues .
It is about happy and contented dogs who have found new lives , chase tennis balls and play with their new owners .
Unfortunately , people think that just because they do not receive that “ perfect pet ” from the shelters they are worthless and undesirable , returning them in a short time .
Most do not have a clue that every animal who walks through their doors has a hidden story to tell … and usually it is not very pretty .
Yet sometimes it can be , like Tank ’s story .
Hey , do you have some tennis balls for your own rescued dog ?
Our favorite response :
( Written by one of our readers to some of our viewers ) : “ Our son too served in Iraq .
I am sorry you feel so bitter about a story that will encourage people to love and care not only about the realness of someone like you and the realness of the love an animal gives .
All three of our sons have served in the military : Army : son making a career 20 + years and earning his Bachelor Degree .
He is caring and loving and strong and a great leader .
Navy : son just retired after 20 year career and is finishing his Bachelors Degree .
He too is a kind good person .
Air Force : son served 5 years .
Navy : husband served 21 years .
He is the inspiration for all of our family > he served in Vietnam three times in land .
He is an inspiration to so many people because of his caring , compassion and leadership .
Son in law : 20 years retired Navy .
He is a kind , good man .
This story is tender and meaningful .
It does not matter if it is truth or fiction :
If humanity is inspired to understand the military as humans and the animals as worth , the Truth is revealed .
Love and God bless you and may you know that angels surround you .
The wife and mom of good men like yourself … ”

RPC サーバの遅延リター ン
最近は過労気味でウェブにものを書くこともできない , という話で上司の同情を誘うべく 日本人の労働時間やストレスの実態をまとめた
エンドレス・ワーカーズ を読んだら , 自分の労働時間は日本人労働者の上位 2 割から漏れていることを知り愕然とした. あんなに働いたってのに...残業エリートへの道は険しい.
道を進みたいわけじゃないけれど. ( 平均は越えてたぜ ! )
いずれにせよ流行からはすっかり脱落しているので , 時流を無視して仕事の話でもしよう.
以前 , 会社の blog で RPC の結果をノンブロッキングスタイルで受け取るプリミティブ " 弱関数 " を提案した .
でも試行錯誤の結果 , いまは使っていない .
C++ での弱参照は意図しないリークを作りやすい.
使いわすれることも多く , 忘れた頃にクラッシュする .
要求は明示的にキャンセルした方がいいことがわかった.
( 世間はみんなそうやってますね ... )
さて , 結果の受け取りは非同期/ノンブロッキング
RPC の一面に過ぎない .
今日は呼び出された RPC を非同期に処理する作りについて書いてみたい .
復習 : RPC のノンブロッキング呼び出 し
まず復習として , RPC のノンブロッキング呼び出し側についてざっとバリエーションを眺めよう.
例題はありがちな名簿サービス :
interface AddressBook { // 住所の文字列から一致した人を返すつもり... List < Person > findByAddress ( String address ) ; } ;
RPC のノンブロッキング呼び出しにはいくつかのアプローチがある .
Future や IAsyncResult のようなポリング派と , Deferred のようなコールバック派が二大派閥だ .
使いやすさは一長一短だけれど , ポリング派はブロッキングで作られたアプリケーションを部分的にノンブロッキング化するとき , コールバック派は最初からノンブロッキング主体に書かれたコードベースで , 使われることが多いと思う .
足回りに使う通信フレームワークの流儀に合わせることもある. 古の ONC RPC はどちらもサポートしている .
( 教科書ではそれぞれ nonblock rpc , callback rpc と呼ばれていた . )
私の仕事はノンブロッキング主体のコードベースが相手だから , とりあえずコールバック派に限って話を進めたい.
コールバック派の中にもコールバック関数の登録方法でバリエーションがある.
Deferred のように戻り値へコールバックを登録させるものもあれれば...
// コールバック派のノンブロッキング RPC 呼び出し疑似コード public classs AddressBookProxy implements IAddressBookClient { public Async< List < Person > > findByAddress ( String address ) { ... } } ; ... Deferred < List < Person > > found = addrbook.findByAddress(" suzuran st. " ) ; found.addCallback (... ) ; // ここで登録
GWT RPC のように コールバック自身を追加の引数に渡す亜種もある .
// これも疑似コード public classs AddressBookProxy implements IAddressBookClient { public void findByAddress ( String address , Async< List < Person > > callback ) { ... } } ;
本題 : RPC 受け取り側のノンブロック 化
本来なら RPC の受け取 り( サーバ ) 側にも同様の議論があるはずだが , クライアントのノンブロッキング呼び出しをサポートする
RPC 処理系であっても サーバ側の実装をノンブロッキングに作れるものは案外少ない .
サーバにはマルチスレッドかつブロッキングを想定することが多い.
// ブロッキングスタイルの RPC サービス実装 public class AddressBookServiceImpl implements IAddressBookService { public List < Person > findByAddress ( String address ) { List < Person > found = .... データベースに問合せて結果をとりだす.... ; return found ; } } ;
けれどサーバの実装がシングルスレッドや再入を許さないマルチスレッドで作られているとき , ブロッキングスタイルは都合が悪い. ノンブロッキングにしたい = リターンを遅延したいことがある .
リターンを遅延するとは , RPC の実装メソッド ( 上の例だ と AddressBookServiceImpl.findByAddress ( ) ) の中では 結果の値を返すかわりに遅延を通知し , 別のタイミングで実際の値を返したいということ .
たとえばデータベースの処理をワーカスレッドに任せ , 自分自身は処理を終えたい . そして計算の終わったワーカから戻り値を返したい.
あるいは別のサーバに(非同期で)問合せた結果を自身の戻り値に利用したい.
けれど素朴なブロッキングスタイルでサーバを実装すると , こうした期待は叶わない .
public class AddressBookServiceImpl implements IAddressBookService { public List < Person > findByAddress ( String address ) { m_workers.enqueue(new AddressFinder ( address , ... ) ) ; ... ここでどうすればいい？ ... } } ;
ではどのように遅延リターンを実現するのが望ましいだろう?
まずは RPC の前提である " 要求- 応答 " モデルを持つ通信層として , いくつかの HTTP サーバを調べてみよう .
Twisted .
Web : 戻り値で遅延を通知+引数のメソッドでリターンを通知
ノンブロッキングの通信フレームワークである
Twisted は , ノンブロッキングの HTTP サーバ Twisted .
Web を持っている .
Twisted .
Web で応答を遅延するコードは次のように書ける . ( コピペ元 . )
class ExampleResource ( Resource ) : def render_GET ( self , request ) : def hello( ) : request. write ( " hello world " ) request.
finish ( ) # これでリターン通知 reactor.callLater ( 10 , hello ) # 10 秒後に " hello world " と応答する return server .
NOT_DONE_YET
# 遅延通知
コールバックである render_GET ( ) からフレームワークに特別な戻り値
NOT_DONE_YET
を返し , タイマーに登録したコールバックから遅延処理を実行している.
ちなみに応答を遅延しない場合は戻り値に応答の中身 ( " hello world " など ) を返せばいい .
Jetty 6.0 Continuation : 例外で遅延を通知
Java の HTTP サーバである Jetty の バージョン 6.0 は , 遅延リターンの仕組み " Continuation " を実装していた .
( コピペ元 . )
private void doPoll ( HttpServletRequest request , AjaxResponse response ) { HttpSession session = request.getSession ( true ) ; synchronized ( mutex ) { Member member = ( Member ) chatroom.get(session.getId ( ) ) ; //
Is there any chat events ready to send ? if (!member.hasEvents ( ) ) { //
No - so prepare a continuation Continuation continuation = ContinuationSupport.getContinuation ( request , mutex ) ; member.setContinuation(continuation ) ; // wait for an event or timeout continuation .
suspend ( timeoutMS ) ; } member.setContinuation ( null ) ; // send any events member.sendEvents ( response ) ; } }
一見するとよくわからないけれど , coninuation .
suspend ( ) の呼びだしで 特別な例外がおこり , 処理は doPoll ( ) を飛び出して Jetty に戻る. そ して別の誰かが coninuation.resume ( ) を呼びだすと , 再び doPoll ( ) が呼び出される .
つまり遅延通知に例外を使っている .
Twisted .
Web よりだいぶわかりづらい .
Servlet 3.0 : 引数のメソッドと注釈で遅延を通知
Servlet は 3.0 から非同期応答をサポートした .
Jetty の continuation もこれで置き換えられるらしい .
( コピペ元 . )
@WebServlet ( " / foo " asyncSupported=true ) public class MyServlet extends HttpServlet { public void doGet ( HttpServletRequest request , HttpServletResponse response ) { ... AsyncContext aCtx = request.startAsync(request , response ) ; // 遅延通知 ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolExecutor ( 10 ) ; executor.execute( new AsyncWebService ( aCtx ) ) ; } } ... public class AsyncWebService implements Runnable { AsyncContext ctx ; public AsyncWebService ( AsyncContext ctx ) { this.ctx = ctx ; } public void run ( ) { //
Invoke web service and save result in request attribute // Forward the request to render the result to a JSP. ctx.forward ( " /render.jsp " ) ; // これがリターン } }
まず doGet ( ) メソッドに特別な注釈をつけ , 実行時には 引数の request オブジェクトに対し遅延を通知するメソッド startAsync ( ) を呼びだしている .
サンプルでは同時にワーカスレッドを起動する.
そして処理が完了すると , スレッドは startAsync( ) の戻り値である AsyncContext のメソッドを呼び出して戻り値を返す . ( =リターンする . )
Jetty の例外脱出 + 同じメソッド再呼び出しモデルよりはわかりやすくなった.
...
HTTP の遅延リターンは三つの実装に三種類のバリエーションを見ることができた :
戻り値で遅延を通知+引数のメソッドでリターンを通知
( Twisted .
Web )
例外で遅延を通知 ( Jetty6 Continuation )
引数のメソッド呼び出しで遅延を通知 ( Servlet 3.0 )
HTTP の非同期応答 API を一通り眺めたところで , 今度はその上に載せる RPC の API を調べてみよう .
Ice RPC : 引数のメソッドでリターン通知
RPC 実装のひとつ ZeroC の
Ice は非同期応答をサポートしていた .
( コピペ元はパッケージ付属の async サンプル )
// Hello.ice のインターフェイス定義 interface Hello { [ " ami " , " amd " ] idempotent void sayHello ( int delay ) throws RequestCanceledException ; void shutdown ( ) ; } ; // 実装 void HelloI::sayHello_async( const Demo:: AMD_Hello_sayHelloPtr& cb , int delay , const Ice :: Current& ) { if ( delay == 0 ) { cout << " Hello World ! " << endl ; cb->ice_response( ) ; // これがリターン } else { _work Queue -> add ( cb , delay ) ; } }
インターフェイス定義で " amd " ( Asynchrounous Method Dispatching ) を指定すると , 実装の第一引数に特別なオブジェクトがやってくるようになる.
渡ってきたオブジェクト cb に対し , リターンを示す ice_response ( ) を呼び出すまで応答が遅延されるのだろう.
デフォルトの挙動が非同期なため , 遅延を明示的に通知する必要はないようだ.
protocol buffer : 引数のメソッドでリターンを通知
protocol buffer はどうか .
( コピペ元 . )
// in . proto service SearchService { rpc Search ( SearchRequest ) returns ( SearchResponse ) ; } ... // in .cc class ExampleSearchService : public SearchService { public : void Search ( protobuf :: RpcController * controller , const SearchRequest * request , SearchResponse * response , protobuf : : Closure * done ) { if ( request -> query ( ) == " google " ) { response -> add_result ( ) -> set_url ( " http://www.google.com " ) ; } else if ( request -> query ( ) == " protocol buffers " ) { response -> add_result ( )-> set_url ( " http://protobuf.googlecode.com " ) ; } done-> Run( ) ; // これがリターン } } ;
Run ( ) がリターンに相当する .
これもデフォルトで非同期なため , 遅延を通知する必要はない .
少し面白いのは , 複数の引数があっても XxxRequest という単一のオブジェクトにまとめられるところ .
RPC を " 引数や戻り値の直列化とメソッドディスパッチ " と割り切り , 実装に使える関数シグネチャの自由度は諦めている.
引数の個数を揃えるとランタイムとの相性が良くなり , 生成するコードサイズを小さくできるのかもしれない. ( 単なる手抜きかもしれないけれど . )
WCF : 属性と戻り値による遅延+リターン通知
WCF も 遅延リターンをサポートしている .
ここでも IAsyncResult を使っているのは一貫性があっていい . ( コピペ元. ) WCF のデフォルトはブロッキングスタイルなので , 属性の AsyncPattern パラメタで非同期化を支持している .
// interface [ OperationContractAttribute ( AsyncPattern=true ) ]
IAsyncResult BeginServiceAsyncMethod( string msg , AsyncCallback callback , object asyncState ) ; // Note :
There is no OperationContractAttribute for the end method .
string EndServiceAsyncMethod( IAsyncResult result ) ; // implementation ... public IAsyncResult BeginServiceAsyncMethod ( string msg , AsyncCallback callback , object asyncState ) { Console .
WriteLine ( " BeginServiceAsyncMethod called with : \ " {0}\ " " , msg ) ; return new CompletedAsyncResult < string >( msg ) ; } ... public string EndServiceAsyncMethod( IAsyncResult r) { CompletedAsyncResult< string > result = r as CompletedAsyncResult < string > ; Console .
WriteLine ( " EndServiceAsyncMethod called with : \ " {0}\ " " , result .
Data ) ; return result .
Data ; } ...
クライアントにはこれを ServiceAsyncMethod ( ) として公開することもできるらしい. サービスの EndServiceAsyncMethod ( ) はどんなタイミングで呼ばれるのだろう.
スレッドモデルが想像できない .
直接の真似はできないにせよ , WCF のハイテクぶりと protobuf のローテクは遅延リターンの作りを決める論点を絞ってくれた : RPC の約束する " 関数呼び出し " の幻影を , ノンブロッキングという現実の中で誰にどれだけ信じさせるか.
聴衆の種類と努力の量が支配的なパラメタになりそうだ.
クライアントに幻影を見せつつサービス実装側を泥臭くするのか.
サービス実装者も夢を見たいのか. そのためのランタイムはどれだけリッチにするか.
コード生成だけで逃げきるか. リフレクションの魔法に頼るか.
魔法を使ったときにデバッグはできるか...
バリエーションは広い .
ベイパーウェア A : 戻り値を使った遅延通 知
さて , HTTP サーバと RPC はそれぞれに遅延リターンの手法があり , 共通点もあれば差異もあった .
HTTP 固有の方法に着目し , それを RPC に借用して幻影度を高められないだろうか .
たとえば Twisted .
Web のように戻り値を遅延の通知に使えないか考えてみる .
けれど , これは少し難しい .
RPC では , サービスの結果をあらわすのに戻り値を使いたい .
戻り値のデータ型はメソッド毎に IDL 上で定義されている .
その型が遅延をあらわす NOT_DONE_YET
相当をうまく表現できるとは限らない .
動的型付けの言語なら戻り値の型に制限を受けないから , シングルトンの NOT_DONE_YET
を 遅延通知に使えるかもしれない .
静的型付けの言語でも型システムのトリックでうまく
" 特別な値 " を作れるかもしれない .
もう一つ問題がある 遅延したリターンは最終的にどこから返せばいいだろう .
class AddressBookServiceImpl : def findByAddress ( address ) : def find ( self , ... ) : .... return xxx # この戻り値をどうやってクライアントに返すか？ reactor.callWorker( find ) # ワーカスレッドに処理を任せる空想上のメソッド return NOT_DONE_YET
あまり良いアイデアがない .
ベイパーウェア B : Deferred で戻り値を使ったリターン通 知
そういえば Twisted はクライアン ト ( 呼び出し ) 側で
Deferred を特別な戻り値に使っていた .
WCF の IAsyncResult のようにサーバ側でも同じスタイルをとれないか .
class AddressBookServiceImpl : def findByAddress ( address ) : d = Deferred ( ... ) def find ( self , ... ) : .... d.callback ( ret ) # Deferred を介しリターンを通知 reactor.callWorker( find ) return d # 結果の値ではなく Deferred オブジェクトを返 す
これはとても自然に見えるけれど , 面倒なところもある .
サービスの実装を呼びだした RPC 処理系は , Deferred に対して結果を受け取るコールバックを登録したい .
ところが戻り値として Deferred を返す前に , findByAddress ( ) 内から Deferred の callback ( ) を呼び出されてしまう( =処理を遅延しない)こともありうる.
class AddressBookServiceImpl : def findByAddress ( address ) : d = Deferred ( ... ) d.callback ( ret ) # NG ! : findByAddress ( ) がリターンし # addCallback ( ) される前に戻り値をコールバックしてしまう return d ... # テストケースなど d = service.findByAddress (... ) # ← ここで d.callback ( ) されているので d.addCallback (... ) # ← ここで登録したコールバックは取りこぼされる
このとき素朴な RPC 処理系はサービスの戻り値を受けとりそびれるかもしれない .
処理系は取りこぼしがないよう工夫する必要がある.
ちょっと面倒そう .
対する WCF はポリング派だから取りこぼしが起きないんだね. 絶妙だなあ .
ベイパーウェア C : 例外を使った遅延通 知
別の候補も考えてみよう .
Jetty Continuation のように例外を使うのはどうだろう .
個人的には悪くないと思っている .
Jetty Continuation がまずかったのは , 休眠からの復帰先に休眠開始時と同じメソッドを使うところだった , 高階関数を使って普通に継続を表現すれば , さほど無理なく例外を " 特別な戻り値 " に使えるかもしれない .
仮に ruby っぽく書くならこんなかんじ :
class AddressBookService ... def find_by_address( addr ) raise defer do |res| worker.enque do res.respond( AddressBookDb.find_by_address (... ) ) end end end ... end
ワーカなりへ処理をキューイングすると同時に , メソッドから遅延通知の例外を投げる.
ワーカに切り離されたクロージャと例外は遅延処理を追跡する情報が共有しており , RPC 処理系は例外を通じてそれを参照し , クロージャからのリターンを待つ .
例外を遅延通知に使うのは無作法だけれど利点もある.
特に便利なのは , メソッドのシグネチャがブロッキングスタイルと同じになるところ. だから " 普段はブロッキングでいいけど時々ノンブロッキングにしたい " という時に都合がいい .
勤務先の場 合
仕事で使う内製の RPC も遅延リターンができる .
内製 RPC にはいくつかの言語で実装がある .
C++ 版は , Ice と同じく引数通知スタイルを使う .
IDL の定義にはない特別なオブジェクトがメソッド引数に追加され , その引数を通じてリターンを通知する .
コードベースのポリシーで C++ 例外は使えないし , 戻り値も C++ では使いにくい .
( オブジェクトの確保と解放の対応づけがわかりにくくなってしまう.)
引数を増やすのはみっともないけれど , 手堅い実装をするには悪くない .
Python 版と ActionScript 版は例外通知スタイルを使う .
この二つを使う場面ではあまり遅延リターンをすることもないだろうという期待から , 遅延のないケースがクリーンにかける例外通知スタイルを使っている.
( ActionScript 版 RPC にサーバ機能があるのはデバッグの小細工用 ; サーバといっても実際に listen ( ) するわけではなく , なんとなくサーバっぽく動くだけ . )
実際に使ってみたところ , ActionScript なら例外通知モデルもそれほど複雑にならないことがわかった .
ActionScript はクロージャのおかげで遅延後のコードがコンパクトに書けるからかもしれない.
Python 版の遅延リターンは使いこんでないのでよくわからず .
余談 : Python 版にはブロッキングスタイルの RPC 実装もある .
適当なマルチスレッドの HTTP サーバに載せて使う .
C++ でノンブロッキングのコードを書いたあとに
Python 版でブロッキングのコードを書くと , そのあと C++ に帰るのが辛くなる .
まだ幻影の効き目が弱い .
ノンブロッキングスタイルで実装されたサービスの単体テスト(は面倒)
更に脇道へ .
ノンブロッキングの RPC を使うコードベースの単体テストは少し面倒くさい .
個々のオブジェクトをテストする面倒は想像がついていたけれど , 他にも困る場面があった .
たとえばインターフェイ ス I を定義したリモートのサービスを使うクライアント
C のテストを書くとき , C のテストから呼ばれ る I プロキシのモック M を適当にでっちあげたい .
モック支援の弱い C++ のような言語だと , モックのかわり に I のリアルな実装 S を使って済ますことが多い .
S の実装がオンメモリで扱いやすいものならそれで我慢できる .
分散透過万歳!
ところがノンブロッキングスタイルで実装されたサービスはプロキシのモック代わりに使いにくい.
ノンブロッキングスタイルの場合 , 同じ IDL から生成されてもプロキシとサービスのシグネチャが違う .
// proxy は戻り値通知スタイルを採用 ... abstract public Future < List < Person > > findByAddress ( String address ) ; ... // service は引数通知スタイルを採用 ... abstract public void findByAddress ( Response < Future < List < Person > > resp , String address ) ; ...
つまりテストしたいクライアント C は , 実際にはプロキシ用インターフェイ ス
Ip を参照しており , 一方でサービスの実 装 S はサーバ用インターフェイ ス
Is を実装している .
そして Ip と
Is は互換性がない .
ブロッキングスタイルだ と
Is と
Ip は同じになることが多いけれど , ノンブロッキングスタイルでこの二つを揃えるのは案外難しい.
仕方ないので M を
Ip にあわせるややこしいアダプタを作るか , インプロセス に M をホストして通信するか , 再利用を諦め て
Ip にあわせたモックを実装することになる .
どれもいまいち冴えない . うまい C++ のトリックでなんとか
Is と
Ip を揃えられないものかと考えるもいまのところ妙案なし .
なんとかしてください > 同僚のひと
別の解決策も考えられる .
まずプロキシとサーバの両方で同じ通知スタイルを採用し , ( 例 : 引数通知 ) 通知オブジェクトの型もプロキシとサーバで揃えれば ( 例 : IAsyncResult ) インターフェイスを統一できる .
通知オブジェクトは複雑になるけれど , なんとか頑張れないもんかなあ . そのへんを頑張り切った WCF はエラい .
まとめ
サーバ側でもノンブロッキング/遅延リターンのできる
RPC がほしい .
LAST week , the stock market tumbled on news that housing foreclosures and delinquencies rose again in the first quarter .
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said that among the 34 million loans it tracks , foreclosures in progress rose 22 percent , to 844,389 .
That figure was 73 percent higher than in the same period last year .
But the comptroller ’s office also said that amid the gloom , there was promising data about loan modifications : they rose 55 percent in the quarter .
That growth came on a very low base , of course , but the move encouraged John C. Dugan , head of the comptroller ’s office .
“ As the administration ’s ‘ Making Home Affordable ’ program gains traction and helps offset the impact of this very difficult economic cycle , ” he said in a statement , “ we should continue to see progress in future reports . ”
A glimpse of second - quarter mortgage data , however , indicates that the progress Mr. Dugan and his colleagues in Washington are hoping for may take longer to emerge  raising questions about whether policymakers and banks are moving quickly or intelligently enough on the foreclosure problem .
Moscow 's skyline and architectural heritage are on the verge of being destroyed forever because of low - quality renovations and thoughtless demolition , according to a report released yesterday by a group of Russian and international activists .
" There is no other capital city in peacetime Europe that is being subjected to such devastation for the sake of earning a fast megabuck , " the Moscow Architecture Preservation Society stated in its report .
The authors said that hundreds of important buildings – from 19th - century palaces to masterpieces of Stalinist architecture – were being neglected or demolished .
The problems have been blamed on a lack of legal consequences for developers who ruin listed buildings .
Critics of the system say that opaque development plans mean the public is left in the dark until works are under way .
And while the financial crisis has slowed down some of the more rapacious developers , the dried - up cash flow also means that there is less money to spend on quality renovation work .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" An all - round lowering of standards , the triumph of vandalism and the obstruction of every last vacant space on the skyline is the legacy that the last decade has bequeathed to Moscow , " wrote Anna Bronovitskaya , an art historian .
The report also blamed " a theme park approach to an historic city " and an overabundance of cars .
Even where attempts had been made to renovate historical buildings or build within the architectural context of the area , the results were often atrocious .
The report spoke of " bloated sham replicas of historic buildings " dominating the skyline .
An earlier version of the report was published two years ago but the authors said that after a pause in the demolition of listed buildings and an increased willingness on the part of city authorities to listen to public concerns , former service was soon resumed .
" There has been no progress in the last two years , things have got worse and worse , " said David Sarkisyan , the director of the Shchusev State Museum of Architecture in Moscow .
" This is probably a battle that we are not going to win , but it 's one that is very important to fight . "
The report listed eight buildings of historical value , including one thought to be the oldest surviving wooden building in the city , which have been demolished or irrevocably ruined in the past year .
Dozens more are at risk due to neglect or poor renovations , including world - famous buildings .
Just across from the Kremlin , the once majestic facade of the Bolshoi Theatre is covered in tarpaulin , its insides gutted , and the whole crack - ridden structure apparently in danger of collapse .
The theatre , which closed for much - needed reconstruction work in 2005 , was due to re-open last year but the renovations are running years behind schedule and over cost .
Last week , Alexander Vedernikov , the chief conductor and musical director of the Bolshoi , walked out on the theatre , citing disagreement with the management and disgust at the renovation effort .
Of particular concern are Constructivist buildings , seen internationally as some of the most important architecture that Russia has given the world .
Many of them stand semi-derelict .
Buildings such as Narkomfin , a pioneering experiment in communal living , have been slated for ambitious renovation plans for years , but work has been endlessly delayed and the building is cracked , peeling and in need of saving .
Many blame the post -Soviet architectural chaos on the reign of Yury Luzhkov , the city 's powerful Mayor who has been in office since 1992 .
On Mr Luzhkov 's watch , Moscow has been transformed from the drab centre of world communism to a thriving hub of ultra-capitalism .
But the rapid development of Moscow has not been unequivocally positive ; it has come with haphazard building practices , low - quality constructions and the neglect or destruction of historical buildings .
There are also allegations of corruption when it comes to tenders and contracts for construction .
Mr Luzhkov 's wife , Yelena Baturina , is Russia 's only female billionaire and one of the country 's largest construction magnates .
The crisis is not limited to the capital .
Historians and activists say that Moscow 's poor example has been aped across Russia .
Of most concern is St Petersburg , the Tsarist capital whose elegant centre was spared the usual Soviet replanning and is free of monolithic concrete structures .
Now that is changing .
" Right next to historical buildings there are horrible eyesores showing up that we are powerless to oppose , " said an activist from the northern city , Elena Minchyonok .
" If this carries on for another year or two , St Petersburg as we know it now it will cease to exist . "

Release notes
Here is the collection of the most important release notes links that you can use to look up information on the Mozilla website .
Thunderbird 2
There have been some major changes to the appearance and features of Thunderbird such as the ability to tag emails which works almost the same way as tagging bookmarks at del.icio.us for example .
The interface was redesigned with new icons which look way better than the old ones .
Everything looks more friendly to the eye .
( I like the flame which is the new symbol for junk mails ) .
The search reacts now like those nice Ajax scripts that you find anywhere on the web nowadays .
It displays results as you type which makes it easier to find emails during searches .
I did not have much time to play around with all settings but for the time being I think that the new release is a major improvement .
Seems to react a lot faster during program start and mail retrieval .
Message Tags
Improved visual theme .
Back and forward buttons to navigate through the message history .
Different folder views .
Popular web mail service wizard for easier integration .
Improve email alerts and support for extensions .

Thunderbird 2.0.0.5
There have been only two security fixes in this version of Thunderbird but 21 bug fixes which should get rid of some bugs that caused headaches for some users of Thunderbird .
The rumbling edge website has a detailed list of all the fixes of this version with links pointing to explanations if needed .
The security fixes have been the following :
Fixed : MFSA 2007 - 18 - Crashes with evidence of memory corruption ( Critical )
Fixed : MFSA 2007 - 23 - Remote code execution by launching Firefox from Internet Explorer ( Critical )
Thunderbird 2.0.0.6
The same security vulnerabilities that have been fixed in Firefox 2.0.0.6 have also been fixed in Thunderbird which means that you should update immediately to the latest version .
As far as I can tell there are no new features in this version , at least all my extensions are still working fine .
The Rumbling Edge lists the following three fixes for Thunderbird 2.0.0.6
Fixed : MFSA 2007 - 27 - Unescaped URIs passed to external programs ( Critical )
Fixed : MFSA 2007 - 26 - Privilege escalation through chrome - loaded about : blank windows ( Moderate )
Thunderbird 2.0.0.9
The Rumbling Edge lists 39 improvements over version 2.0.0.8 which is also only available on the ftp site at the moment .
Nine improvements have the critical status which means the upgrade should be performed as soon as possible .
There is no word yet as well if this is the release version or yet another release candidate version for testers only .
It seems to work fine and I was not able to spot any problems thus far using it .
Thunderbird 2.0.0.12
The new version is already available for all supported operating systems and languages .
The Rumbling Edge reports 25 fixes and improvements over the previous version .
The release notes however are not official .
The official ones will be released with the announcement on the Mozilla homepage .
The most important fixes in my opinion are the two Topcrashes and the two Crashes issues that have been fixed .
Mac users will probably like that the bug that the capital J could not be written in some fields in Thunderbird has been fixed .
Oh , if you are wondering why the new version is called 2.0.0.12 and not 2.0.0.10 or 2.0.0.11 .
That 's an effort to synchronize Firefox and Thunderbird versioning once again .
Thunderbird 2.0.0.14
Several bugs and two security issues have been fixed in Thunderbird 2.0.0.14 and it is advised to update the email client as soon as possible .
The security issues that have been fixed in Thunderbird 2.0.0.14 have been classified as moderate .
They fix crashes with evidence of memory corruption and one JavaScript privilege escalation and arbitrary code execution .
The seven other issues that have been fixed can be found at the Rumbling Edge website .
One random crash has been fixed for instance .
If your check for updates does not find a new version head to the official Thunderbird website , the new version is already provided as a download on the main page there .
Thunderbird 2.0.0.16
The new Thunderbird update is a security release that fixes 6 moderate and 2 low vulnerabilities which obviously means that it is recommended to update the email client as soon as possible to patch the security vulnerabilities .
You could head over to the Security Advisories to read up on the security vulnerabilities that the Thunderbird team fixed in the issue , the release notes on the other hand do not reveal any additional information about this release .
Happy Updating !
Thunderbird 2.0.0.17
The update is a security update and it is therefor recommended to update immediately if Thunderbird is installed and in use on a computer system .
Interested users can take a look at the release notes for the new version which contain a link to the security issues that have been fixed .
The update fixes the following two critical and five moderate security vulnerabilities that can be exploited in earlier versions of the mail client :
MFSA 2008 - 46 Heap overflow when canceling newsgroup message
MFSA 2008 - 44 resource : traversal vulnerabilities
MFSA 2008 - 43 BOM characters stripped from JavaScript before execution
MFSA 2008 - 42 Crashes with evidence of memory corruption ( rv:1.9.0.2/1.8.1.17 )
MFSA 2008 - 41 Privilege escalation via XPCnativeWrapper pollution
MFSA 2008 - 38 nsXMLDocument:: OnChannelRedirect ( ) same - origin violation
MFSA 2008 - 37 UTF - 8 URL stack buffer overflow
The update checks in the email client can be used to download the latest version .
Users find that option in the Help > Check for Updates menu in Thunderbird .
Thunderbird 2.0.0.18
The following security issues have been fixed :
MFSA 2008 - 46 Heap overflow when canceling newsgroup message
MFSA 2008 - 44 resource : traversal vulnerabilities
MFSA 2008 - 43 BOM characters stripped from JavaScript before execution
MFSA 2008 - 42 Crashes with evidence of memory corruption ( rv:1.9.0.2/1.8.1.17 )
MFSA 2008 - 41 Privilege escalation via XPCnativeWrapper pollution
MFSA 2008 - 38 nsXMLDocument:: OnChannelRedirect ( ) same - origin violation
MFSA 2008 - 37 UTF - 8 URL stack buffer overflow
Thunderbird 2.0.0.19
Update : Thunderbird 2.0.0.19 fixes seven security vulnerabilities .
MFSA 2008 - 68 XSS and JavaScript privilege escalation
MFSA 2008 - 67 Escaped null characters ignored by CSS parser
MFSA 2008 - 66 Errors parsing URLs with leading whitespace and control characters
MFSA 2008 - 65 Cross - domain data theft via script redirect error message
MFSA 2008 - 64 XMLHttpRequest 302 response disclosure
MFSA 2008 - 61 Information stealing via loadBindingDocument
MFSA 2008 - 60 Crashes with evidence of memory corruption ( rv:1.9.0.5/1.8.1.19 )
Thunderbird 2.0.0.21
Many users would probably want to update their email client immediately after reading that it contains patches for security issues .
Several users reminded us last time we posted a link to a release of Firefox and Thunderbird that we should not do so .
So , no link for now which is kinda stupid as everyone with half a brain will be able to find the Mozilla ftp site with the download link of Thunderbird 2.0.0.21 .
Everyone else will have to sit tight with an insecure version of Thunderbird until the official distribution process has been completed and the update is officially announced .
Some add - ons might stop working after installing Thunderbird 2.0.0.21 .
You could try and change the allowed version number manually or wait for the software developer to update the add - on for the email client .
Thunderbird 2.0.0.23
The Mozilla Thunderbird development team has released an important update for the Mozilla Thunderbird email client .
The upgrade which will increase the version of the email client to 2.0.0.23 includes one critical security fix that was reported by security researcher Dan Kaminsky .
The compromise of SSL - protected communication vulnerability allows attackers to obtain certificates that would function for any site they would like to target .
The email client should pick up the update upon its next startup automatically .
Thunderbird users can alternatively use the Help > Check For Updates function in the email client or visit the Mozilla Thunderbird website to obtain the update .
The vulnerability , which was disclosed on August 1 is not only affecting the email client but also other Mozilla applications included Mozilla Firefox 3.5 or Firefox 3.0.13 .
IOActive security researcher Dan Kaminsky reported a mismatch in the treatment of domain names in SSL certificates between SSL clients and the Certificate Authorities ( CA ) which issue server certificates .
In particular , if a malicious person requested a certificate for a host name with an invalid null character in it most CAs would issue the certificate if the requester owned the domain specified after the null , while most SSL clients ( browsers ) ignored that part of the name and used the unvalidated part in front of the null .
This made it possible for attackers to obtain certificates that would function for any site they wished to target .
These certificates could be used to intercept and potentially alter encrypted communication between the client and a server such as sensitive bank account transactions .
Begin Thunderbird 3.0 Releases
Thunderbird 3.0
After several beta versions and two release candidates the final version of the popular desktop email client Thunderbird 3 has finally been released to the public .
The developer 's have not published a changelog detailing the changes between the second release candidate and the final release .
The short time between both releases suggests that not much has been changed since then .
Thunderbird users who are still running Thunderbird 2 and other interested users might want to read up on the new key features of the email client :
Tabbed Email : Provides the ability view individual emails and folders in tabs , and web pages via add - ons in tabs so users can quickly jump between them , just as one manages web pages in Mozilla 's Firefox .
Folder tabs are remembered , so Thunderbird starts up pre-configured and personalized to each user .
Filtered Search : Designed with search in mind , the new search interface in Thunderbird 3 contains filtering and timeline tools to help users quickly and accurately pin-point the exact email by word matches , correspondents or even attachment types at the moment they need it , all based on analysis of the user 's own emails .
Message Archive : Archiving mail moves email from the inbox into the new archive folder system , de-cluttering the inbox while at the same time enabling users to find email months or years from now .
One-click Address Book :
A very quick and easy way to add people to an address book , by simply clicking on the star icon in the messages received from new correspondents .
New Mail Account Setup Wizard : Getting started with Thunderbird 3 is faster than ever with the new account set - up wizard that requires simple information , like email addresses and passwords to get going instead of a user 's IMAP , SMTP , SSL / TLS settings .
Smart Folders : Combines individual mailboxes to help manage multiple email accounts in one spot .
For example , by selecting the Inbox , users can view all the incoming emails from all their different accounts without having to go to each email account separately .
Add-ons Manager :
The new add - ons manager can help users find , download , and install hundreds of add - ons enabling them to customize Thunderbird 3 and add functionality or change the appearance .
Better Integration with Gmail : Now integrates with international versions of Gmail and Gmail 's special folders such as sent and trash .
Better Integration with Windows and Mac OS X : Updated look and feel , improved import tools , search integration , and address book support for Windows 7 , Vista and Mac OS X Snow Leopard .
Gecko 1.9.1 Engine :
The same Web page rendering engine and graphics infrastructure used in Firefox , provides the latest Web Standards support and security enhancements .
Automated Updates : Thunderbird 's update system notifies users when a security update is available and automates the download and installation process to keep users safe .
Thunderbird 3.0.1
Mozilla Thunderbird 3.01 is a security and stability release that fixes several issues in the email client .
The list of changes lists 124 bugs that have been fixed in the new release including 25 bugs that have received a critical rating and 17 that received a major rating by the developers .
Most of the critical issues that have been fixed are related to crashes but there also have been some security fixes .
Users who are planning to install Thunderbird 3.01 should take a look at the known issues before they do so to make sure that they do not run into problems using the email software .
Thunderbird 3.0.2
The next installment of the popular desktop email client Thunderbird has been released by the Mozilla Messaging team .
A total of 56 bugs have been fixed in the new Thunderbird release including several that caused crashes .
At least one security issue was also fixed in the new version of the email client , namely a DNS prefetch security issue .
This version also fixes an update for Outlook Express users who want to migrate to Thunderbird 3 as previous versions had troubles importing messages with many recipients or large msg header .
The full list of bug fixes and changes is accessible at the Rumbling Edge .
Thunderbird 3.0.3
In the case of Thunderbird 3.0.3 it is a single bug fix that fixes missing folders and an empty folder pane for some users who have updated to Thunderbird 3.0.2 .
Mozilla Messaging recommends the new release to all Thunderbird 3 users even if they have not been affected by the bug .
Thunderbird 3.0.4
Bugzilla reports a total of 82 bugs that have been fixed in Thunderbird 3.0.4 , among them 19 critical and 6 major bugs .
Most of the critical bugs fix crash related issues in the email client , good news for users who have been experiencing crashes on a regular basis .
* Several fixes to improve stability and security , see the Security Advisory .
* Several fixes to the user interface .
Mozilla Thunderbird 3.1.2
The developers consider the release a stability fix .

This indicates a mandatory for every user of the Thunderbird 3.1 branch .
Bugzilla lists 83 bugs that have been fixed in the beta version of the email client , of which 13 have been rated as critical .
On top of the security and stability fixes , several fixes to the user interface have been made .
Do n't expect any noticeable changes though , the release 's aim was to fix bugs , not to add or change features in the email client .
Thunderbird 3.1.4
We have already seen lots of updates this week ;
From the first beta of Internet Explorer 9 , to updates for the Firefox web browser and Google Chrome updates .
Lots of downloading , updating and testing for a week .
An update for the desktop email client Thunderbird was just released , raising the version of the email software to 3.1.4 .
The version is considered a stability update , and therefor a recommended update for all Thunderbird users of the 3.x branch .
The release notes mention several stability updates and fixes to the user interface .
A closer look at the bugs listed at the bug tracking service Bugzilla shows four fixes , including a fix for the bug that was earlier this day fixed in the Firefox web browser .
Several crash related bugs where fixed , especially one when new mail arrived and the user clicked either on the system tray icon , or the new mail notification information .
Thunderbird 3.1.5
So what 's new in Thunderbird 3.1.5 ?
According to the release notes of the beta , Thunderbird 3.1.5 includes several stability and security fixes , as well as fixes to the user interface of the email software .
Bugzilla lists a total of 59 buts that have been resolved in this new version of Thunderbird .
Eleven bugs have received a critical rating , the second highest severity rating available .
Thunderbird 3.1.6
The security vulnerability that was discovered two days ago was fixed in the Firefox web browser yesterday with an emergency out of band update .
The same vulnerability affects the Thunderbird email client as well , which is why the developer 's have rushed an update for the email software .
How is Thunderbird affected by the vulnerability anyway ?
If you remember , the email client has browser - like capabilities , and that 's where it becomes vulnerable .
The user needs to open a website in Thunderbird that exploits the vulnerability .
If the email client has not been upgraded the system could be compromised , and an attacker could get remote access to the local system .
Thunderbird users who do not use the browser - like features are safe , but should update anyway to eliminate the possibility of a successful attack .
Thunderbird 3.1.7
The security fixes alone should be reason enough for Thunderbird users to update the email client as soon as the new version gets released by the development team .
A quick look at Bugzilla lists a total of 84 different bugs that have been fixed in Thunderbird 3.1.7 including a total of 26 different critical issues and one blocker issue .
Most issues listed are related to crashes in the email client .
Thunderbird 3.1.10
The release notes of the new version of the email client mention several performance , stability and security fixes without going into greater detail .
The linked Security Advisory page does not list the changes in that new release yet , which leaves Bugzilla as the only source of information .
Bugzilla lists a total of 71 bugs that have been fixed in Mozilla Thunderbird 3.1.10 , of which two have received the highest possible rating blocker .
Additionally , 16 of the issues listed have received a severity rating of critical , and another four one of major .
Several of the fixes appear to be language related , for instance crash fixes when spell checking with French or Hungarian dictionaries , or update crashes when localized strings excess certain parameters .
Just check Bugzilla for the full list of fixes in this version of Thunderbird .
The release , unlike that of Firefox 4.0.1 is already available for download at the official Mozilla Messaging website .
Newer Releases
Thunderbird 5
The final version of the desktop email client Thunderbird 5.0 has been released by Mozilla .
With the streamlining of the release cycle with the Firefox browser come additional similarities .
Thunderbird now sports the very same add - on manager that Mozilla added to the Firefox browser earlier .
The email account creation wizard has been revised to improve the setup of new email accounts in the program .
See the list below for a full list of changes in Thunderbird 5 .
New Addons Manager and extension management API ( user interface will be changed before final release )
Tabs can now be reordered and dragged to different windows
Revised account creation wizard , offering improved set - up
Attachment sizes now displayed along with attachments
New troubleshooting information page to aid supporting and diagnosing problems in Thunderbird
New troubleshooting information page to aid supporting and diagnosing problems in Thunderbird Plugins can now be loaded in RSS feeds by default
Various other user interface fixes and improvements
Support for Mac 32/64 bit Universal builds ( Thunderbird Beta will no longer support PowerPC on Mac )
The big version jump from Thunderbird 3.1 to 5 will definitely render some addons incompatible .
The easiest way to force compatibility is to install the Addon Compatibility Reporter extensions .
Thunderbird 6.0
By joining the rapid release cycle Thunderbird updates have become as frequently as those of the Mozilla Firefox web browser .
It is therefor no surprise that Mozilla Messaging has just released version 6.0 of the email client Thunderbird on the same day that Firefox 6.0 was officially released .
With that release , the release cycle is running in sync with that of the Firefox web browser .
So what is new in Thunderbird 6.0 ?
The release notes , which are up already on the official website , list the following items that have been updated , changed or added to the email client .
Thunderbird is based on the new Mozilla Gecko 6 engine
Several theme improvements for Windows 7
Support for Windows 7 Jump lists
Several fixes when importing email from Microsoft Outlook
Default mail client check now works with newer Linux distributions
Various other user interface fixes and improvements
Numerous platform fixes that improve speed , performance , stability and security
The feature list , as you can see , is rather small , and offers barely any new features for users of the email program .
Windows 7 users benefit from jumplist support and theme improvements .
Jumplists show up when a Windows user right - clicks on the icon in the taskbar .
For now , Thunderbird users get links to their address book , writing a new message and the mailbox .
Thunderbird 7
The release notes list several changes and feature enhancements .
Thunderbird is based on the new Mozilla Gecko 7 engine
Several user interface fixes and improvements
Several fixes to attachment handling
Ability to print a summary of selected email messages
Platform improvements to Address Book
Fixed several security issues
Numerous platform fixes that improve speed , performance and stability
Nothing major as you can , mostly under the hood improvements or changes that the majority of users might not even recognize .
The Welcome to Thunderbird page after updating or installing the new version lists additional features .
I 'm not sure if they all made their way into this version or if they have been available before .
Thunderbird 7 starts up faster and is more responsive according to that feature listing .
A new troubleshooting information page is listed there as well .
It looks exactly like the page of the Firefox web browser .
Thunderbird 8
So what 's new in Thunderbird 8 ?
The beta release notes , which have been published last month list the following improvements :
Add -ons installed by third party programs are now disabled by default
Added a one - time add - on selection dialog to manage previously installed add - ons
Improved accessibility of the attachment lists
Several user interface fixes and improvements
and numerous other platform fixes
The big new feature is the blocking of automatic installations via third party software programs .
This is actually the same feature that made it into Firefox 8 released a few days ago .
In addition , Thunderbird users now get a one - time dialog when the update in which they can manage installed add - ons .
The email client will suggest add - ons that may not be compatible giving the user the choice to disable them to improve stability of the email client .
Update :
The calendar add - on Lightning for Thunderbird has been released in version 1.0 as well today .
Thunderbird 9.0
The release notes list several fixed security vulnerabilities which make Thunderbird 9 a mandatory update for all users of the email client .
The security advisories page lists a total of seven security vulnerabilities , of which one has been rated critical and the other six as moderate .
It is however relative unlikely that Thunderbird will see attacks exploiting the issue , as it uses a crash when scaling an Ogg video element to extreme sizes .
The remaining list of changes is not nearly as spectacular .
Thunderbird 9 uses the new Mozilla Gecko 9 engine , and an opt - in system to send anonymous performance and usability reports to Mozilla .
The data is used to improve future versions of the email client .
This is the same feature that has already been implemented into the Firefox web browser .
Windows users can now show and hide the menu bar when they press the Alt key .
The change log furthermore lists better keyboard handling for attachments without going into details as to what has been improved in the version .
The only other features listed in the change log are additional support for Personas , and " several user interface fixes and improvements " .
Thunderbird 9 ships with another change that has not been mentioned in the release notes .
Users who click on the Tools menu will notice a new Test Pilot entry there .
This is a Thunderbird extension that the developers have installed in the email client .
Test Pilot is used to " make Thunderbird better by running user studies " .
Silently installing the extension without giving users options to opt - out during updating or installation is definitely something to be criticized .
Thunderbird users can however uninstall the extension in the add-ons manager .
Thunderbird 10.0
Mozilla today , after releasing Firefox 10 , has also released Thunderbird 10 , a new version of the email software .
Thunderbird too is now flagging add - ons as compatible by default .
Add -ons ship with minimum and maximum version compatibility information .
The issue previously was that add - ons were flagged as incompatible if the author failed to update the version information in time .
This made it difficulty for developers to keep their add - ons compatible with the latest releases .
Another change is the native integration of the Open Search extension in the email client .
A right - click now displays an option to search for the selected term on the Internet .
This is handled in the email client and not in the default system web browser .
The rendering component uses the Gecko 10 engine that the Firefox web browser uses as well .
Users who do not want their searches to open in the email client can set the preference mail.websearch.open_externally to true .
This is done with a click on Tools >
Options , switching to Advanced >
General , clicking on Config Editor in the menu and filtering for the above preference .
Just double - click it to toggle its value from false to true .
Is there a way to disable web search completely ?
Not that I 'm aware off .
Maybe there is a preference but I have not found it yet .
Two new keyboard shortcuts have been added to Thunderbird 10 , in addition to the changes outlined above .
It is now possible to add attachments to messages with the Ctrl - Shirt - A ( Command - Shift - A ) shortcut .
Named anchors can now be removed with Ctrl - Shift - R ( Coammdn - Shift - R ) , and messages in the message reader and compose window can now be zoomed with the scroll wheel ( Ctrl - Scroll Wheel ) .
Thunderbird 10.0.1
Thunderbird 10.0.1 is a stability and security release , and as thus a recommended update for all users of the messaging software .
The update is already available , and Thunderbird users can either download it from the official developer website or use their client 's internal updater to download and apply it .
A click on Help >
About Thunderbird performs the update check and displays the current version of the program in a small window .
Lets take a look at the changes in Thunderbird 10.0.1 .
The security advisory page over at Mozilla offers details on the issue that has been fixed in the update .
It affected not only the email client , but also Thunderbird and SeaMonkey as well .
Mozilla developers Andrew McCreight and Olli Pettay found that ReadPrototypeBindings will leave a XBL binding in a hash table even when the function fails .
If this occurs , when the cycle collector reads this hash table and attempts to do a virtual method on this binding a crash will occur .
This crash may be potentially exploitable .
The change log lists several fixes to improve stability without going into further detail on the subject .
Sören Hentzschel mentioned a crash in the client 's importer when importing mails from Microsoft Outlook .
The release of Thunderbird 10.0.1 comes less than two weeks after the last update that moved the version of the email client to 10 .
Thunderbird 10 introduced a new right - click search option to search directly from within Thunderbird .
Results are either displayed directly in Thunderbird in new tabs , or in the default web browser whichever is preferred .
Other changes include new keyboard shortcuts and an extension compatibility change that should reduce the issues that Thunderbird users have in this regard .
Thunderbird 11.0.1
Thunderbird 11.0.1 has been released by Mozilla Messaging only two weeks after the update to Thunderbird 11 has been pushed out to all Thunderbird users .
When you look at the changes in the Thunderbird 11.0.1 release you will notice that there are only two .
That 's not really surprising considering the time between the release of version 11 of the email program and this version .
Both fix bugs in the email client that affect only part of the program 's user base , and both are not security related .
The first fixes an issue that may cause hangs when handling IMAP mail .
It had been reported on March 7
frequently enough ( 1/10 or so ) when I hit space or n , say yes to the prompt sheet to advance to next folder with unread ( or , just click on a folder to switch to it ) this results in a hang .
server is exchange over imap hanging on central / central since sometime in January , I think ... a bit hard to narrow it down as the reproducibility is a bit random .
Actually , the str could be something like : read stuff , idle for a minute , switch to a folder with no unread , hit space and yes to advance .
The bug report is difficulty to read , but it basically states that the email client hangs when reading emails when using IMAP .
The second fixes a issue that may cause filters that move mail to specific folders to be erroneously changed .
This bug was filed on March 14 , and has now been fixed in the latest version of the email program .
1 . I have an imap account with roughly 50 filters - coincidentally the account that handles my bugmail 2 .
i accidentally moved one folder ( drag and drop ) tb- enterprise which has ONE filter pointing to it , such that it became a subfolder of another folder , which itself is a target of ONE filter .
3 . after some drag mistakes , I got tb - enterprise back to it 's original location as a subfolder of X in local folders 4 . 10 hours later I find that many ( ~ 25 ) filters are now pointing to tb- enterprise - precisely , every filter BELOW the th- enterprise filter was affected
It basically corrects an issue with filters that may get changed by accident if you move folders that have filters pointing to them in the email client .
The change log lists one unresolved issue :
If you are unable to view content for your RSS feeds in the Wide View Layout , you may need to disable the Lightning Calendar add - on if you have it installed or switch to Classic View and restart Thunderbird
Thunderbird 12.0
Thunderbird 12.0 is a security and maintenance update for the email client .
The official release notes mentions several security fixes without going into detail .
The security advisories page that the announcement links to has not been updated yet with a list of security vulnerabilities that have been fixed in Thunderbird 12.0 .
This is likely going to happen soon though .
For now , the information are not available .
The only new feature that the developers have added to Thunderbird 12.0 is that global search results in the browser now display message extracts in the results .
I personally can't really see a difference to the way search was handled before in the email client .
Maybe someone else who has spotted the difference can point me in the right direction on this one .
Thunderbird 12.0 furthermore includes various improvements to RSS feed subscriptions and general RSS feed handling .
This includes a fix that makes sure that feeds are deleted cleanly and completely from the messaging client .
Developers can now make use of different mail stores .
A full list of changes can be accessed here .
The page lists all changes that have made their way into the Thunderbird 12 email client .
Existing Thunderbird users should check the known issues to make sure that they do not run into issues after the upgrade .
Once issue affects users who view RSS feeds in the wide view layout with the Lightning add - on installed .
The other that local mail folders and pop3 mail filters may " produce summary files that are n't correctly read by previous versions of Thunderbird " .
The developers recommend to delete the .msf files in the Thunderbird user profile directory before downgrading the client .
Thunderbird 12.0.1
With Thunderbird 12.0 having been released less than a week ago , it may come as a surprise to may that Mozilla Messaging is already preparing a follow up release to resolve several issues that became known after the release of Thunderbird 12.0 was already on its way out to the users .
Here is a list of issues that will be addressed in Thunderbird 12.0.1
Pop3 Filters that move messages to IMAP folders do not work correctly most of the time .
According to David Bienvenu , this is a " regression from the pluggable store work " implemented into Thunderbird 12 . [ bug 748090 ]
Pop3 filters that move / copy incoming messages to imap folders will not work , for the most part , except for the last message downloaded in get new mail operation .
For this reason , it is probably best to disable such filters until this bug is fixed .
Filters that are run manually should work .
Message body not loaded when using fetch headers only if message is in a sub -folder .
Messages in sub folders that are retrieved this way to do not load by clicking on the here button .
All a user sees is a blank page , even the header with buttons is not displayed .
[ bug 748865 ]
Received messages contain parts of other messages with movemail accounts . [ bug 748726 ]
New mail notification issues after upgrading to TB 12 .
Users basically may experience notifications for emails that they have already retrieved .
[ bug 748997 ]
Crash fix in nMsgDatabase [ bug 748432 ]
Thunderbird 13.0
When you look at the changes and additions , you will notice that there are not that many .
It needs to be noted that the developers have fixed several security vulnerabilities in Thunderbird 13 , making the update a recommended one for all users of the desktop email client .
When you analyze the fixed security vulnerabilities you will notice that the developers have fixed four critical ones , two high ones , and one moderate vulnerability :
MFSA 2012 - 40 Buffer overflow and use - after - free issues found using Address Sanitizer
MFSA 2012 - 39 NSS parsing errors with zero length items
MFSA 2012 - 38
Use - after - free while replacing / inserting a node in a document
MFSA 2012 - 37 Information disclosure though Windows file shares and shortcut files
MFSA 2012 - 36 Content Security Policy inline - script bypass
MFSA 2012 - 35 Privilege escalation through Mozilla Updater and Windows Updater Service
MFSA 2012 - 34 Miscellaneous memory safety hazards
As far as features go , the new file link option which allows Thunderbird users to store larger file attachments on file hosting services instead .
Thunderbird would then replace the attachment with a file link pointing to that file on the file hosting site instead .
The benefits should be obvious : it is now possible to send larger file attachments without having to worry about them bouncing back , and recipients receive emails faster as they do not have to download a large attachment first before they can do so .
At the time of writing , only YouSendIt is integrated into Thunderbird for that purpose .
It is however likely that the developers will add other file hosting services in the near future .
The method is identical to Microsoft 's way of using the company 's own SkyDrive service for large file attachments .
The second new feature is a cooperation of Thunderbird with the email service providers Hover and Gandi , that allows users to sign - up for a new email account right from within the Thunderbird application .
The feature is available under Account Settings > Account Actions > Add Mail Account .
It is again a feature that the developers want to grow over time .
Lastly , the minimum system requirements for Thunderbird have changed to Windows XP Service Pack 2 or later .
Thunderbird 13.0.1
Busy day for Mozilla .
After releasing Firefox 13.0.1 earlier , an update for the desktop email client Thunderbird was released as well bringing the version of the application to 13.0.1 .
The Thunderbird update , just like the Firefox update , is fixing select issues in the browser only .
You may remember that Mozilla earlier implemented a Filelink feature in the email client that allowed users to upload large file attachments to a file hosting service like YouSendIt or Dropbox to avoid bounced emails and a handful of other related issues ( with Dropbox having been removed shortly after the introduction ) .
Files uploaded to the YouSendIt host this way expired after 1 week automatically , which obviously needed to be corrected .
The Thunderbird 13.0.1 update fixes the issue , so that files uploaded to YouSendIt do not expire after 1 week automatically anymore .
The remaining fixes in Thunderbird 13.0.1 are listed below :
The prompt given when a password had changed sometimes referred to a network error rather than a change of password
Some Linux users may have been unable to start Thunderbird from outside the installation directory
Miscellaneous other stability and display updates
Especially Linux users who have noticed the issue mentioned should upgrade to the latest version of the email client as soon as possible to correct it .
Thunderbird users who have made use of the Filelink feature will also benefit from the changes as a 1 week expiration date may have caused all kinds of issues .
This includes requesting the attachment again if the email was opened after that one week period for instance .
Thunderbird 15.0
Since Firefox and Thunderbird use a synced release schedule , it comes as no surprise that the stable version of the Thunderbird email client has been updated today as well .
While that may not be the case for much longer , with Mozilla moving priorities away from Thunderbird and all , you will at least get simultaneous releases until Thunderbird 17 .
Thunderbird 15 introduces four new features or improvements over previous versions of the email program .
Probably the biggest addition in the version is support for instant messaging and chat which moves Thunderbird towards an all in one messaging solution than a program that you can only use for email related tasks .
Before you can use Thunderbird for chatting and instant messaging , you need to set up at least one chat account or protocol before the option becomes available .
Thunderbird 15 supports Internet Relay Chat ( IRC ) , Twitter , Facebook Chat , Google Talk and XMPP .
If you are using one of the supported options you can now chat in real time with contacts .
Another interesting feature is the chat history which you can search right from within the Thunderbird interface .
What you will probably notice immediately are new theme elements taken from the Australis theme that is added to Firefox as well .
In this version of Thunderbird , you get new toolbar and menu designs .
A new service provider has been added to Thunderbird 's FileLink feature .
The feature provides you with an option to park larger attachments on file hosting services instead of sending them directly as attachments .
The benefit for this is a faster mail retrieval for the recipient , the ability to modify the file on the file hosting site ( if permitted by the host ) , and the elimination of bouncing emails due to file size limits .
The new provider is UbuntuOne , which you can now select when you set up online storage services in Thunderbird .
Check out this guide to add the popular file hosting and synchronization service Dropbox as a provider .
The fourth and final feature is a do not track option for Thunderbird 's Search the web feature .
Thunderbird 15.0.1
Mozilla has just released an update for the email client Thunderbird that brings the version of the program to 15.0.1 .
An update shortly after a release , the Thunderbird 15.0 release dates back two weeks , is usually an indication of a bug in the release that is causing issues for many of the program 's users .
It is not uncommon that Mozilla has to push out updates shortly after a release .
This just happened a few days ago when the company released Firefox 15.0.1 , an update for the web browser that resolved a issue with the private browsing mode that did not work properly anymore .
The Thunderbird 15.0.1 on the other hand has nothing to do with that .
The release notes list two issues that have been fixed in the new version .
The fist addresses stability issues in the client when searching or forwarding emails , the second a fix for the find and replace feature and several other actions in the compose window that did not work properly in Thunderbird 15.0 .
Stability issues causing crashes when searching emails and forwarding emails ( 770262 , 780908 )
Find and replace and some other actions in the compose window were not working correctly ( 787673 )
The links point to Bugzilla where additional information about each issue are available .
Existing Thunderbird users should get update notifications when they start up the email client the next time .
It is alternatively possible to click on Help > About Thunderbird to check for updates manually .
Thunderbird should pick up the update then and install it automatically on the system .
Thunderbird 16.0
Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird are always updated at around the same time .
It therefore comes as no surprise that Thunderbird 16.0 has been released a day after Firefox 16 .
The email client does not appear to be affected by the security vulnerability detected in Firefox 16 which got Mozilla to pull the web browser from the website with the recommendation to downgrade Firefox 16 to 15.0.1 .
Thunderbird 16.0 comes with two feature additions , security fixes and various stability and performance related fixes .
The client 's filelink feature , introduced some time ago , has been updated with a new online storage service .
The feature enables you to store email attachments on supported file hosting sites instead of sending them directly with the email .
The main benefit here is that you do not have to worry about file size limitations and bouncing emails anymore .
Recipients too benefit from this as they get the emails faster since they do not have to download the attachment right away .
The new storage provider integrated into Thunderbird is box.com which you can can configure by going to Tools > Options > Attachments >
Outgoing .
The second new feature is the implementation of silent background updates which basically makes the email client download and install updates in the background , so that the next start and the final push at that time are not delaying the start up of the email client that much anymore .
Windows Vista and newer version of Windows users furthermore benefit from a new maintenance service that gets installed on the system which enables Mozilla to bypass an UAC prompt that would otherwise appear during updates of the program .
A total of 13 different security related issues have been fixed in Thunderbird 16 , of which 10 have received the highest vulnerability rating of critical .
MFSA 2012 - 87 Use - after - free in the IME State Manager
MFSA 2012 - 86 Heap memory corruption issues found using Address Sanitizer
MFSA 2012 - 85 Use - after - free , buffer overflow , and out of bounds read issues found using Address Sanitizer
MFSA 2012 - 84 Spoofing and script injection through location .
hash
MFSA 2012 - 83 Chrome Object Wrapper ( COW ) does not disallow acces to privileged functions or properties
MFSA 2012 - 82 top object and location property accessible by plugins
MFSA 2012 - 81 GetProperty function can bypass security checks
MFSA 2012 - 80 Crash with invalid cast when using instanceof operator
MFSA 2012 - 79 DOS and crash with full screen and history navigation
MFSA 2012 - 77 Some DOMWindowUtils methods bypass security checks
MFSA 2012 - 76 Continued access to initial origin after setting document .
domain
MFSA 2012 - 75 select element persistance allows for attacks
MFSA 2012 - 74 Miscellaneous memory safety hazards ( rv:16.0 / rv:10.0.8 )
Other notable changes include the fixing of a memory leak on some IMAP operations , scrolling improvements and various crash fixes .
Thunderbird 17.0.3
Mozilla 's decision to put development of the Thunderbird email client on the back burner to concentrate on " more promising " projects like Firefox OS has caused quite the stir on the Internet and especially among Thunderbird users .
That 's despite the fact that there is not really a lot to add to the email client in terms of functionality or features , at least not those that are available on the frontend of the program .
The decision was made to involve the community - more - in the updating process to move Mozilla engineers to other projects .
What this basically means for the next foreseeable future is a concentration on security fixes and major bug fixes , and not on adding new features to the email program .
Thunderbird is still following the same release schedule as the Firefox web browser , it comes therefore at no surprise that version 17.0.3 was released yesterday alongside Firefox 19 .
Please note that 17.0.3 is the version that the stable channel was updated to .
It appears that beta channels are still increasing in full version steps .
So what is new in Thunderbird 17.0.3 ?
Mozilla fixed eight security vulnerabilities in the client .
Four of the vulnerabilities have received the highest rating of critical , two a rating of high , and two one of moderate .
MFSA 2013 - 28 Use - after - free , out of bounds read , and buffer overflow issues found using Address Sanitizer
MFSA 2013 - 27 Phishing on HTTPS connection through malicious proxy
MFSA 2013 - 26 Use - after - free in nsImageLoadingContent
MFSA 2013 - 25 Privacy leak in JavaScript Workers
MFSA 2013 - 24 Web content bypass of COW and SOW security wrappers
MFSA 2013 - 23 Wrapped WebIDL objects can be wrapped again
MFSA 2013 - 22
Out - of - bounds read in image rendering
MFSA 2013 - 21 Miscellaneous memory safety hazards ( rv:19.0 / rv:17.0.3 )
That 's nothing compared to the 19 vulnerabilities that Thunderbird 17.0.2 fixed though .
Still , if you are running Thunderbird make sure you update the program as soon as possible to protect your system from attacks targeting those vulnerabilities .
The only other issue fixed in this version of Thunderbird repairs that attachments sometimes could not be removed using the keyboard .

Israeli legal authorities have indicted former Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert on corruption charges .
The indictments filed Sunday charge Olmert with illegally accepting funds from an American backer , and double - billing for trips abroad .
He faces charges including fraud and breach of trust .
The charges surfaced when Olmert was still prime minister , eventually forcing him to step aside .
Olmert allegedly committed the offenses while serving as mayor of Jerusalem and later as a Cabinet minister , and before being elected prime minister in 2006 .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Olmert was replaced as prime minister in March by Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu .
He left politics and is currently a private citizen .
Olmert has denied any wrongdoing .
IT WAS another big occasion and yet another world record for a Jamaican sprinter , Usain Bolt , on Sunday August 16th .
At the athletics World Championships he broke the 100 metres sprint record again , taking his own time down to 9.58 seconds from 9.69 seconds , set a year ago at the Beijing Olympics .
This is the most the record has fallen since electronic timing was first used in 1968 .
In the century or so since official records began a little more than a second has been shaved off the quickest time for the sprint , an improvement of some 10 % .

I read a fantastic article in Nature magazine ( vol 459 , pp931-939 ( 18 June 2009 ) ) that summarizes not only the current state of novel H1N1 ( aka Swine Flu ) understanding , but also a compares H1N1 against other flu strains .
In particular , it discusses in - depth how the pathogenic components — i.e. , the stuff that kills you — compare against each other .
The Influenza virus is quite fascinating .
Allow me to ramble on …
Comparison to Computer Viruses
How many bits does it take to kill a human ?
The H1N1 virus has been comprehensively disassembled ( sequenced ) and logged into the NCBI Influenza Virus Resource database .
For example , an instance of influenza known as A / Italy / 49/2009 ( H1N1 ) isolated from the nose of a 26 - year old female homo sapiens returning from the USA to Italy ( I love the specificity of these database records ) , has its entire sequence posted at the NCBI website .
It ’s amazing — here ’s the first 120 bits of the sequence .
atgaaggcaa tactagtagt tctgctatat acatttgcaa ccgcaaatgc agacacatta
Remember , each symbol represents 2 bits of information .
This is alternatively represented as an amino acid sequence , through a translation lookup table , of the following peptides :
MKAILVVLLYTFATANADTL
In this case , each symbol represents an amino acid which is the equivalent of 6 bits ( 3 DNA - equivalent codons per amino acid ) .
M is methionine , K is Lysine , A is Alanine , etc. ( you can find the translation table here ) .
For those not familiar with molecular biology , DNA is information - equivalent to RNA on a 1 to 1 mapping ; DNA is like a program stored on disk , and RNA is like a program loaded into RAM .
Upon loading DNA , a transcription occurs where “ T ” bases are replaced with “ U ” bases .
Remember , each base pair specifies one of four possible symbols ( A [ T / U ] G C ) , so a single base pair corresponds to 2 bits of information .
Proteins are the output of running an RNA program .
Proteins are synthesized according to the instructions in RNA on a 3 to 1 mapping .
You can think of proteins a bit like pixels in a frame buffer .
A complete protein is like an image on the screen ; each amino acid on a protein is like a pixel ; each pixel has a depth of 6 bits ( 3 to 1 mapping of a medium that stores 2 bits per base pair ) ; and each pixel has to go through a color palette ( the codon translation table ) to transform the raw data into a final rendered color .
Unlike a computer frame buffer , different biological proteins vary in amino acid count ( pixel count ) .
To ground this in a specific example , six bits stored as “ ATG ” on your hard drive ( DNA ) is loaded into RAM ( RNA ) as “ AUG ” ( remember the T -> U transcription ) .
When the RNA program in RAM is executed , “ AUG ” is translated to a pixel ( amino acid ) of color “ M ” , or methionine ( which is incidentally the biological “ start ” codon , the first instruction in every valid RNA program ) .
As a short - hand , since DNA and RNA are 1:1 equivalent , bioinformaticists represent gene sequences in DNA format , even if the biological mechanism is in RNA format ( as is the case for Influenza–more on the significance of that later ! ) .
OK , back to the main point of this post .
The particular RNA subroutine mentioned above codes for the HA gene which produces the Hemagglutinin protein : in particular , an H1 variety .
This is the “ H1 ” in the H1N1 designation .
If you thought of organisms as computers with IP addresses , each functional group of cells in the organism would be listening to the environment through its own active port .
So , as port 25 maps specifically to SMTP services on a computer , port H1 maps specifically to the windpipe region on a human .
Interestingly , the same port H1 maps to the intestinal tract on a bird .
Thus , the same H1N1 virus will attack the respiratory system of a human , and the gut of a bird .
In contrast , H5 — the variety found in H5N1 , or the deadly “ avian flu ” — specifies the port for your inner lungs .
As a result , H5N1 is much more deadly because it attacks your inner lung tissue , causing severe pneumonia .
H1N1 is not as deadly because it is attacking a much more benign port that just causes you to blow your nose a lot and cough up loogies , instead of ceasing to breathe .
Researchers are still discovering more about the H5 port ; the Nature article indicates that perhaps certain human mutants have lungs that do not listen on the H5 port .
So , those of us with the mutation that causes lungs to ignore the H5 port would have a better chance of surviving an Avian flu infection , whereas as those of us that open port H5 on the lungs have no chance to survive make your time / all your base pairs are belong to H5N1 .
So how many bits are in this instance of H1N1 ?
The raw number of bits , by my count , is 26,022 ; the actual number of coding bits approximately 25,054 — I say approximately because the virus does the equivalent of self - modifying code to create two proteins out of a single gene in some places ( pretty interesting stuff actually ) , so it ’s hard to say what counts as code and what counts as incidental non-executing NOP sleds that are required for self - modifying code .
So it takes about 25 kilobits — 3.2 kbytes — of data to code for a virus that has a non-trivial chance of killing a human .
This is more efficient than a computer virus , such as MyDoom , which rings in at around 22 kbytes .
It ’s humbling that I could be killed by 3.2 k bytes of genetic data .
Then again , with 850 Mbytes of data in my genome , there ’s bound to be an exploit or two .
Hacking Swine Flu
One interesting consequence of reading this Nature article , and having access to the virus sequence , is that I now know how to modify the virus sequence to probably make it more deadly .
Here ’s how :
The Nature article notes , for example , that variants of the PB2 Influenza gene with Glutamic acid at position 627 in the sequence has a low pathogenicity ( not very deadly ) .
However , PB2 variants with Lysine at the same position is more deadly .
Well , let ’s see the sequence of PB2 for H1N1 .
Going back to our NCBI database :
601 QQMRDVLGTFDTVQIIKLLP
621 FAAAPPEQSRMQFSSLTVNV
641 RGSGLRILVRGNSPVFNYNK
As you can see from the above annotation , position 627 has “ E ” in it , which is the code for Glutamic acid .
Thankfully , it ’s the less - deadly version ; perhaps this is why not as many people have died from contracting H1N1 as the press releases might have scared you into thinking .
Let ’s reverse this back to the DNA code :
621 F A A A P P E Q S R 1861 tttgctgctg ctccaccaga acagagtagg
As you can see , we have “ GAA ” coding for “ E ” ( Glutamic acid ) .
To modify this genome to be more deadly , we simply need to replace “ GAA ” with one of the codes for Lysine ( “ K ” ) , which is either of “ AAA ” or “ AAG ” .
Thus , the more deadly variant of H1N1 would have its coding sequence read like this :
621 F A A A P P K Q S R 1861 tttgctgctg ctccaccaaa acagagtagg ^ changed
There .
A single base - pair change , flipping two bits , is perhaps all you need to turn the current less - deadly H1N1 swine flu virus into a more deadly variant .
Theoretically , I could apply a long series of well - known biological procedures to synthesize this and actually implement this deadly variant ; as a first step , I can go to any number of DNA synthesis websites ( such as the cutely - named “ Mr. Gene ” ) and order the modified sequence to get my deadly little project going for a little over $ 1,000 .
Note that Mr. Gene implements a screening procedure against DNA sequences that could be used to implement biohazardous products .
I do n’t know if they specifically screen against HA variants such as this modified H1 gene .
Even if they do , there are well - known protocols for site - directed mutagenesis that can possibly be used to modify a single base of RNA from material extracted from normal H1N1 .
[ Just noticed this citation from the Nature article : Neumann , G. et al Generation of influenza A viruses entirely from cloned cDNA .
Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 96 , 9345-9350 ( 1999 ) .
This paper tells you how to DIY an Influenza A. Good read . ] .
Adaptable Influenza
OK , before we get our hackles up about this little hack , let ’s give Influenza some credit : after all , it packs a deadly punch in 3.2 k bytes and despite our best efforts we can’t eradicate it .
Could Influenza figure this out on its own ?
The short answer is yes .
In fact , the Influenza virus is evolved to allow for these adaptations .
Normally , when DNA is copied , an error - checking protein runs over the copied genome to verify that no mistakes were made .
This keeps the error rate quite low .
But remember , Influenza uses an RNA architecture .
It therefore needs a different mechanism from DNA for copying .
It turns out that Influenza packs inside its virus capsule a protein complex ( RNA - dependent RNA polymerase ) that is customized for its style of RNA copying .
Significantly , it omits the error checking protein .
The result is that there is about one error made in copying every 10,000 base pairs .
How long is the Influenza genome ?
About 13,000 base pairs .
Thus , on average , every copy of an Influenza virus has one random mutation in it .
Some of these mutations make no difference ; others render the virus harmless ; and quite possibly , some render the virus much more dangerous .
Since viruses are replicated and distributed in astronomical quantities , the chance that this little hack could end up occurring naturally is in fact quite high .
This is part of the reason , I think , why the health officials are so worried about H1N1 : we have no resistance to it , and even though it ’s not quite so deadly today , it ’s probably just a couple mutations away from being a much bigger health problem .
In fact , if anything , perhaps I should be trying to catch the strain of H1N1 going around today because its pathogenicity is currently in - line with normal flu variants — as of this article ’s writing , the CDC has recorded 87 deaths out of 21,449 confirmed cases , or a 0.4 % mortality rate ( to contrast , “ normal ” flu is < 0.1 % , while the dreaded Spanish flu of 1918 was around 2.5 % ; H5N1 , or avian flu , is over 50 % ( ! ) , but thankfully it has trouble spreading between humans ) .
By getting H1N1 today , I would get the added bonus of developing a natural immunity to H1N1 , so after it mutates and comes back again I stand a better chance of fighting it .
What does n’t kill you makes you stronger !… or on second thought maybe I ’ll just wait until they develop a vaccine for it .
There is one other important subtlety to the RNA architecture of the influenza virus , aside from the well - adjusted mutation rate that it guarantees .
The subtlety is that the genetic information is stored inside the virus as 8 separate snippets of RNA , instead of as a single unbroken strand ( as it is in many other viruses and in living cells ) .
Why is this important ?
Consider what happens when a host is infected by two types of Influenza at the same time .
If the genes were stored as a single piece of DNA , there would be little opportunity for the genes between the two types to shuffle .
However , because Influenza stores its genes as 8 separate snippets , the snippets mix freely inside the infected cell , and are randomly shuffled into virus packets as they emerge .
Thus , if you are unlucky enough to get two types of flus at once , the result is a potentially novel strain of flu , as RNA strands are copied , mixed and picked out of the metaphorical hat and then packed into virus particles .
This process is elegant in that the same mechanism allows for mixing of an arbitrary number of strains in a single host : if you can infect a cell with three or four types of influenza at once , the result is an even wilder variation of flu particles .
This is part of the reason why the novel H1N1 is called a “ triple - reassortant ” virus : through either a series of dual - infections , or perhaps a single calamitous infection of multiple flu varieties , the novel H1N1 acquired a mix of RNA snippets that has bestowed upon it high transmission rates along with no innate human immunity to the virus , i.e. , the perfect storm for a pandemic .
I have n’t been tracking the latest efforts on the part of computer virus writers , but if there was a computer analogy to this RNA - shuffling model , it would be a virus that distributes itself in the form of unlinked object code files plus a small helper program that , upon infection in a host , would first re-link its files in a random order before copying and redistributing itself .
In addition to doing this , it would search for similar viruses that may already be infecting that computer , and it would on occasion link in object code with matching function templates from the other viruses .
This re-arrangement and novel re-linking of the code itself would work to foil certain classes of anti-virus software that searches for virus signatures based on fixed code patterns .
It would also cause a proliferation of a diverse set of viruses in the wild , with less predictable properties .
Thus , the Influenza virus is remarkable in its method for achieving a multi- level adaptation mechanism , consisting of both a slowly evolving point mutation mechanism , as well as a mechanism for drastically altering the virus ’ properties in a single generation through gene - level mixing with other viruses ( it ’s not quite like sex but probably just as good , if not better ) .
It ’s also remarkable that these two important properties of the virus arise as a consequence of using RNA instead of DNA as the genetic storage medium .
Well , that ’s it for me tonight — and if you made it this far through the post , I appreciate your attention ; I do tend to ramble in my “ Ponderings ” posts .
There ’s actually a lot more fascinating stuff about Influenza A inside the aforementioned Nature article .
If you want to know more , I highly recommend the read .
At some point , someone is going to start noticing that the Obama administration seems to file a lot of legal briefs that are remarkably similar to legal briefs filed by the Bush administration .
You may all recall a certain brief on DOMA filed in June , for example .
Today , we learn that the Obama legal team is adopting Bush ’s position on the “ state secrets privilege ” :
A Supreme Court filing from the Obama administration last month has set off alarm bells on the left .
The filing was a friend - of - the - court brief , and it mostly dealt with an excruciatingly technical question about the attorney - client privilege .
But its last five pages were about the state secrets privilege , which was not at issue in the case .
That privilege , a favorite tool of the Bush administration , allows the government to shut down lawsuits by invoking national security .
The Obama administration ’s brief argued , though no one had asked , that the state secrets privilege was rooted in the Constitution .
The federal government files friend - of - the - court briefs in the Supreme Court all the time , and it is not unusual for it to alert the court to related issues , usually to make sure that the court ’s ruling is no broader than it needs to be .
But the filing has raised eyebrows and suspicions among liberals already disappointed that the Obama administration has not rejected a number of legal doctrines associated with the Bush administration .
Include me in that group of liberals already disappointed .
And , of course , we get the perfunctory , do n’t worry about it statement from an Obama spokesperson :
Mr. Miller , the Justice Department spokesman , cautioned against reading too much into the recent filing .
“ The brief says nothing about either the scope of the privilege or the ability of Congress to legislate in the area , ” Mr. Miller said .
Right .
Do n’t read too much into it .
The brief is only the legal position of the United States of America .
And , they ’re only claiming that it has a basis in the constitution .
Oh , do n’t forget , Congress can fix DOMA , too .
Microsoft recently announced that April 14 , 2009 will mark the beginning of its " phase out " process for the Office 2003 productivity suite and the Windows XP operating system ; two cornerstone programs that will be forced into semiretirement so that more resources can be used towards newer products .
The lifespan of a Microsoft product is dependent on the amount of time and involvement the company allocates when implementing security updates , patches , and similar .
Microsoft Product Life Cycle : Mainstream Support
Office 2003 was released in November 2003 as a successor to Office XP .
At the time the product was made available for purchase it also entered the first stage of its lifespan : release with mainstream support .
Office 2003 has now been given over five years of mainstream support , meaning that since its release , Microsoft has continued to deliver free security patches and other bug fixes to all owners .
Additional Extended Support
In just under two weeks , the product looks to begin the second stage of its lifespan : additional extended support .
While in extended support , non-security hot fixes are only provided to companies that have signed prearranged support contracts with Microsoft .
Permanent Retirement : No Security Updates
The third and final stage of its lifespan will be permanent retirement , meaning that the suite will no longer be treated for exploits ( infections , security holes , etc ) .
However , recognizing that Office 2003 is the second most - recent Microsoft suite in existence , the company will continue offering security updates to all owners of Office 2003 during the extended support stage ( for the time being , at least ) .
As an added bonus , Microsoft has also promised to refresh the junk - mail definitions for Outlook ( the email account included with Office 2003 ) on a regular basis .
Office 2003 : Still Targeted After 5 years
While putting a product that is over five years old into semi-retirement might not be of tremendous concern for most people , consider this : hackers have been known to exploit a critical unpatched bug in PowerPoint 2003 , the presentation maker for Office 2003 , as recently as last Thursday ( April 2nd , 2009 ) !
As it stands , the Office 2003 extended support looks to conclude sometime in April 2014 , though most people hope that Microsoft releases a couple of other productivity suites before then .
Holy mother .

Bowling for Brews [ Diner ’s Journal / NYT ]
Getting fiber to rural communities can be cost - prohibitive , but Rep. Anna Eshoo ( D - CA ) has a plan : force the federal government to build fiber conduit into the sides of all new road projects , making it dirt cheap to string new fiber alongside all interstates when necessary .
Eshoo introduced her plan last week in the form of the Broadband Conduit Deployment Act of 2009 — a bill title mercifully free of the acronym scourge that has so afflicted Congress of late .
The bill would require new federal road projects to include plastic conduits buried along the side of the roadway , and enough of them to " accommodate multiple broadband providers . "
Conduits must meet industry best practices for size and depth , and road builders must include hand holes and manholes along the route to gain access to the conduit .
Each conduit will also include a pull tape for fishing new fiber through the line .
Most of the cost to deploy new fiber is the digging and repaving work , so putting in conduit when the ground is already torn up has a certain logic to it .
It 's a relatively cheap idea , but one that Eshoo hopes will help US broadband .
" Depending on what study you look at , the US ranks anywhere from 15th to 22nd in broadband , behind countries such as Finland , Belgium , and Luxembourg , " she said when introducing the bill .
" This simple , commonsense proposal will actually do a great deal to connect more Americans to more affordable , higher quality broadband connectivity . "
The idea is right out of the New America Foundation 's playbook .
The think tank has been pushing a similar idea for months ; in an issue brief released in January 2009 , authors Ben Lennett and Sascha Meinrath ( who advised the Obama campaign on some tech issues ) suggested putting a couple billion dollars aside " to mandate and fund the build - out of open access , fiber - optic infrastructures into the construction , resurfacing and upgrading of our nation 's highway system .
" Integrating the installation of high - capacity , dark fiber bundles into all Federal - aid and direct Federal highway projects offers the most cost - effective means to bring high - speed fiber connectivity to nearly every community in the nation and create a nationwide fiber infrastructure of unrivaled capacity . "
Eshoo 's bill only includes the conduit , not the open - access fiber network ; private companies will still lay their own fiber , but can save significant money doing it .
As she said , " any authorized communications provider [ could ] come in later and install fiber - optic cable at far less cost . "
The bill has the backing of the big House players on technology — Rick Boucher ( D - VA ) , Ed Markey ( D - MA ) , and Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) — but it will be considered in the Transportation and Infrastructure committee , not the tech - focused subcommittee at Energy and Commerce .
Similar legislation is being prepared for the Senate .
Althoughwill not feature pure offline LAN play -- a cause of significant outcry from the sizablecommunity -- it is likely to feature a mode that allows players to play through a local area network after authenticating online through Battle .
net .
Such a mode would allow for the minimal level of latency that comes with a direct LAN connection , while also maintaining Blizzard 's stated aim of makingan always - connected experience .
"
That 's certainly something we 're discussing , " said lead designer Dustin Browder , after being asked by Gamasutra about the inclusion of the feature .
Battle . net lead Greg Canessa , a former lead on Xbox Live , also spoke up on the matter in another BlizzCon interview .
" Maintaining a connection with Battle .net , I do n't know if it 's once or periodically , but then also having a peer - to - peer connection between players to facilitate a very low - ping , high - bandwidth connection ... those are the things that we 're working on , " he told consumer site Shacknews Separately :
" We really wanted to have a very integrated experience for our players , " Blizzard lead designer Browder told Gamasutra of the decision to push constant Battle .
net connectivity .
" A lot of games these days require an internet connection to play .
" He added : " We really wanted to bring all these players together and keep them in the same pool , and make everything work , so your achievements work , your friends list works , everything just works correctly , as opposed to having two separated ways to play .
" Blizzard did confirm this weekend that it is possible to play 's single - player mode offline , but players will only be able to use a " guest account , " not their persistent accounts , to do so .
A similar method was used in 2000's , which requires online - enabled characters to only play the game when connected to Battle .
net .
The studio has big plans for its online service , including allowing mod-makers to sell StarCraft II custom games .
And Blizzard 's Rob Pardo dropped the surprising news that Battle . net is bigger than World of Warcraft Gamasutra will feature full interviews with both Browder and Canessa in the coming days and weeks .
While it ’s obviously for different reasons , i.e. to shut up those evil libs , Sean Hannity ‘s faithful followers wo n’t let him forget about his offer to be waterboarded .
Actually , it appears that they ’re foaming at their mouths to see it done , much like a pack of rabid sheep .
Here are a few gems from Sean Hannity ’s forum …
Mr. Hannity I would be honor to join you for the waterboarding technique challenge offered by keith olberman .
Although olbermann should not perform the waterboarding because he ’s an idiot and has no idea how it ’s done but I would not have any problem with an ex-military or ex-CIA doing it .
( link )
Further proof that Sean puts his $ $ $ where his mouth is and yet another reason I love Sean ! ( link )
I ’ll hand you a towel Sean .
Show those libs .
( link )
Now that the terrorists know waterboarding technique and that it ’s wo n’t necessary kill em , they ’ll be be prepare for it .
It may even cause waterboarding to be less effective .
Do we need to come up with different enhanced interrogation technique ?
( link )
There is ample proof on Hannity ’s forum that he has some seriously sadistic followers .
With friends like those , he does n’t need enemies !

Amazon was never going to be able to compete with Google ’s YouTube in user - uploaded video content , and it did n’t have the social infrastructure of Facebook to become a destination where people discuss their lives and share videos from around the web .
But what Amazon did have was the resources to purchase a company that was poised to outrun both Facebook and YouTube to a new type of business : live - streaming , in particular video games live - streaming .
The pioneer of that market was Twitch , which Amazon purchased in 2014 for just shy of $ 1 billion .

Twitch is a live streaming platform for video , primarily oriented towards video gaming content .
The service was first established as a spin - off of a general - interest streaming service known as Justin.tv .
Its prominence was eclipsed by that of Twitch , and Justin.tv was eventually shut down by its parent company in August 2014 in order to focus exclusively on Twitch . [ 104 ]
Later that month , Twitch was acquired by Amazon for $ 970 million .
[ 105 ]
Through Twitch , Amazon also owns Curse , Inc. , an operator of video gaming communities and a provider of VoIP services for gaming .
[ 106 ]
Since the acquisition , Twitch began to sell games directly through the platform , [ 107 ] and began offering special features for Amazon Prime subscribers .

The Amazon sales rank ( ASR ) provides an indication of the popularity of a product sold on any Amazon locale .
It is a relative indicator of popularity that is updated hourly .
Effectively , it is a " best sellers list " for the millions of products stocked by Amazon . [ 134 ]
While the ASR has no direct effect on the sales of a product , it is used by Amazon to determine which products to include in its bestsellers lists . [ 134 ]
Products that appear in these lists enjoy additional exposure on the Amazon website and this may lead to an increase in sales .
In particular , products that experience large jumps ( up or down ) in their sales ranks may be included within Amazon 's lists of " movers and shakers " ; such a listing provides additional exposure that might lead to an increase in sales .
[ 135 ]
For competitive reasons , Amazon does not release actual sales figures to the public .
However , Amazon has now begun to release point of sale data via the Nielsen BookScan service to verified authors . [ 136 ]
While the ASR has been the source of much speculation by publishers , manufacturers , and marketers , Amazon itself does not release the details of its sales rank calculation algorithm .
Some companies have analyzed Amazon sales data to generate sales estimates based on the ASR , [ 137 ] though Amazon states :
Amazon 's home page provides three methods to start finding and buying items .
The front page itself shows off featured items , and once the site starts learning your tastes , it will display products based on your history .
To find a specific item , type in the search bar at the top of the page .
Press " Enter " to search the entire catalog , or select from the drop - down menu set automatically to " All " to search a specific category , which also enables the " Refine " capability for more specific results .
If you 'd rather just window shop , click " Shop by Department , " to pick a section to browse .
I do not like the security of this apps .
By default any one in my home can just open it up and start buying things on my account .
I would like it to just add things to my cart on the TV and them buy on " My " Computer or " My " phone .
I know you can setup a PIN for " videos , purchasing and certain types of content " .
But , you then need to enter the PIN for $ 0 videos .
Also , anybody with access to the Fire TV remote can just install the apps and start buying things , no pin , no password , just because you have a Fire TV setup on your account .
Amazon you need to have a separate PIN for Buying videos , parental control ( ratings ) , Apps and Shopping .
And by default the app should setup a PIN .

These products can range from kitchen , household , automotive , cleaning , health , and beauty products , to exercise and fitness products , books , or to toys and games for children .
Typically the packaging for these items includes a standardized red seal in the shape of a CRT television screen with the words " AS SEEN ON TV " in white , an intentional allusion to the logo of TV Guide magazine .[ citation needed ]
Before you can sell your goods on Amazon , you need to create a store through Seller Central .
As a seller , you have the choice of creating either an individual or professional account .
While individuals can list their goods for free , selling as a professional costs $ 39.99 a month plus additional fees based on the value of the final sale .
Individuals typically pay $ 0.99 per item sold in addition to variable fees based on an item ’s category .
Yet the more monumental retail push occurred last summer , when Amazon purchased grocery chain Whole Foods for $ 13.7 billion and proved , yet again , that Bezos is willing and able to buy his way into a new market when it ’s unfavorable to start from scratch .
Amazon now uses Whole Foods ’ grocery pick - up and delivery perks and in - store discounts as a way to reward its Prime subscribers .
It ’s also using its massive resources to lower Whole Foods prices , making it more competitive with Kroger , Target , and Walmart .
In response , Walmart has begun investing heavily in e-commerce and grocery delivery to protect its turf from Amazon , setting the stage for an unprecedented retail war .
Former Vice President Dick Cheney lashed out at President Obama on Sunday , saying the Justice Department ’s decision to investigate whether CIA operatives broke the law while interrogating terrorism suspects was politically motivated and dangerous to national security .
“ I just think it ’s an outrageous political act that will do great damage long - term to our capacity to be able to have people take on difficult jobs , make difficult decisions , without having to worry about what the next administration is going to say , ” Cheney said in an interview on “ Fox News Sunday . ”
He refused to say whether he would cooperate with the Justice Department ’s inquiry .
“ It will depend on the circumstances and what I think their activities are really involved in , ” Cheney said .
Fox ’s formal interview , conducted last week at Cheney ’s Wyoming ranch , was his first since Atty .
Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. announced last Monday that he was conducting a preliminary review into the actions of certain CIA interrogators who might have exceeded the techniques approved by the Bush administration ’s Justice Department .

Obama administration officials said they would have no comment .
Senators appearing on the Sunday talk shows also weighed in .
Sen. Maria Cantwell ( D - Wash . ) said Holder ’s inquiry is necessary and justified .
“ No one is above the law .
And this is not a political process .
This is a legal process . . . to find out whether the law was broken , ” she said on CNN ’s “ State of the Union . ”
Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif. ) expressed misgivings .
She said she understood Holder ’s reasons for launching the probe , but “ the timing of this is not very good ” because the Senate Intelligence Committee , which she chairs , is investigating CIA interrogation and detention techniques .

“ Candidly , I wish that the attorney general had waited , ” she said on CBS ’ “ Face the Nation . ”
In his Fox interview , Cheney also said , as he has before , that the Bush administration ’s “ enhanced interrogation techniques ” saved American lives and prevented terrorist attacks .
The techniques included waterboarding , which simulates drowning .
It was used repeatedly on three top Al Qaeda leaders , including 183 times on Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , the avowed ringleader of 9/11 .
Cheney said the Obama administration ’s second - guessing of the Bush administration “ offends the hell out of me , frankly . ”
“ The approach of the Obama administration should be to come to those people who were involved in that policy and say , ‘ How did you do it ? ’ ” Cheney said .
“ Instead , they ’re out there now threatening to disbar the lawyers who gave us the legal opinions . ”

Cheney ’s comments appeared to be the first Bush administration confirmation that a classified Justice Department report will recommend that two former department lawyers be disbarred for their roles in approving the interrogation techniques .
Both attorneys have left the Justice Department : Jay S. Bybee is now a federal judge , and John C. Yoo is a professor at UC Berkeley .
Cheney said Obama should have stopped Holder from ordering the review because the president had promised not to investigate CIA personnel .
The Obama administration official said the president had never pledged to absolve all CIA officers of any potential wrongdoing -- just those who followed the law .

“ Nothing has changed , ” said the official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the issue .
Also , the official said , career prosecutors in the Bush administration ’s Justice Department were the first to recommend that some attorneys be disbarred for their roles in the coercive techniques .
Cheney said he did not believe that certain interrogators working for the CIA should face criminal charges even for excessive use of waterboarding , or for having threatened some detainees with mock executions , a gun and an electric drill .
Those incidents were disclosed in a 2004 CIA inspector general ’s report that was partly declassified last week , prompting some critics to say that the actions clearly violated U.S. law .
Those issues were reviewed by prosecutors in the Bush administration ’s Justice Department , who decided that no charges should be filed , Cheney said .

“ So even these cases where they went beyond the specific legal authorization , you ’re OK with it ? ”
Fox moderator Chris Wallace asked .
“ I am , ” Cheney responded .
A senior Justice Department official responded , also on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment :
“ It is remarkable that someone who has read the full classified CIA [ inspector general ’s ] report would say that everything in that report was OK . ”
Cheney confirmed that he and President Bush had significant disagreements on important matters -- including whether to bomb Iran to stop its nuclear program .

But , he said , recent news reports were “ wrong ” that he believed Bush “ went soft ” in his second term .
He said his upcoming memoir “ lays out my view of what we did , ” including where he and Bush disagreed .
“ It is going to be a great book , ” Cheney said .
Their willingness to criticize Obama also divides the pair .
Advertisement
After Bush left office , he said he would n’t be criticizing his successor .
“ There are plenty of critics in the arena , ” Bush said .
“ He deserves my silence . ”
He has held to it while Cheney has defended the Bush administration ’s legacy .

There are no fewer than four books available through Amazon concerned with protecting men from the societal and cultural changes wrought by feminism .
Save the Males : Why Men Matter , Why Women Should Care ( Random House , $ 30 ) is merely the latest .
Written by the conservative Kathleen Parker , who is ranked by Media Matters for America as the second - most widely distributed syndicated columnist in the United States , it is a fierce and funny polemic on how " we 've managed over the past 20 years or so to create a new generation of child - men , perpetual adolescents who see no point in growing up , " and " who feel marginalized by the women whose favours and approval they seek . "
She talked to me on the phone from Camden , S.C. , where she lives with her husband , her 23 - year - old son and , on occasion , her two stepsons .
Q : Would you consider yourself a feminist ?
A : I think all women who have their own chequebook are feminists , are n't they ?
I have been paying my own bills all my life .
I have never imagined that somebody was going to take care of me nor have I ever been mistaken for a subservient female .
Q : Has n't feminism helped you ?
A : When I started writing a column 20 years ago , the situation was this :
If an op - ed editor already had a woman on his page , then he was n't going to pick up my column .
Q : But there still is n't much place for women on those pages .
A : Tell me about it .
I am syndicated by the Washington Post Writers Group .
Of the columnists who run regularly on The Washington Post op - ed pages , 15 of the 17 are men .
Q : So why do men need saving ?
A : I think the current crop of men is just fine .
What I tried to show is , if we project into the future and continue on this trajectory , then men are n't doing so well .
I 'm not sure that that 's ultimately going to benefit society and particularly women and children because we want good men .
My premise is that , in trying to make the world more female friendly , we 've actually created a hostile world for men .
And by the way , I am not suggesting we save all men .
I am saving men of the West because I think that they are our friends in a world where women have very serious enemies .
Q : You talk about sitcoms and how they portray men as bumblers .
But on both the big and small screen , women are marginalized .
A : The mass media messages of males are very negative .
Men are depicted as bumbling fools , doofus dads , deadbeats , batterers , incompetent , irresponsible , unreliable and unattractive whereas women are very much the opposite .
It 's the wife who comes in and saves the day .
Even the children are smarter than Dad .
I noticed that my sons have never experienced a culture where men were honoured and admired .
And I wonder what kind of effect that has had on children growing up in this sort of marinade of disrespect .
Q : How can you say that when the vast majority of politicians are men , CEOS are men , male athletes dominate the sports pages , airtime and the endorsement deals , when even male celebrities get paid more than women ?
A : We 're only a couple of generations into this post - feminist world where women have equal opportunities .
I think that they will catch up .
If you look at the educational statistics , it 's the girls who are doing well at school , scoring higher on tests , participating at a greater rate in extracurricular activities .
And when you get to college , girls are leaving boys behind .
Now , obviously , nobody is upset that women are doing well but what we have to look at what is happening to the males .
And are these women going to have partners in the future who are comparably educated and accomplished with whom to have families ?
Q : You talk about fatherless homes , while citing frightening statistics about African - American males .
But does n't that have more to do with poverty ?
A : If you do n't have a father , you also have a very high risk for poverty .
I also think that that community provides a microcosm of what happens .
We have communities where , for generations , there have been no fathers .
That 's why we see gangs .
These are reactions to an absence of the male figure , when boys do not have a real father to be good , positive role models .
Then they fantasize about what manhood and masculinity look like .
They come up with this hypermacho aggressive model that gets them in trouble and lands them in prison .
Q : You say that men can be forced to be fathers against their will .
How is that possible ?
A : Women hold all the cards when it comes to procreation .
We can decide to have an abortion .
We do n't have to talk to the guy if we do n't want to .
Q : That 's if we become pregnant , though .
Does n't a guy have a responsibility to , say , wear a condom ?
A : Well , I think so .
Q : Then he has no right to turn around and complain if the woman gets pregnant , right ?
A : The point is , the guy does not have any opportunity to have any real input , other than the initial input of course .
It 's all up the woman .
It 's not a fair situation because women bear the burden of childbirth and child care .
It 's not a fair situation any way you look at it .
Q : But we 're living in a time when women 's reproductive rights are under attack , when so many men are against a woman 's right to choose or even getting access to contraception .
A : I have always said that I am not willing to make abortion illegal but I think abortion would eliminate itself if everybody were more aware of what abortion does , what it results in for the woman .
Q : There are lots of men giving us the male point of view .
Why do you think you have to ?
A : Men are clueless .
They do n't have any idea that some of these things are going on .
I am doing it for my sons .
I want to have a discussion about how men and women are not enemies .
If men feel women are hostile to them , they 'll be hostile right back .
We have created a culture in which male bashing is a bonding agent for women ; boy bashing is considered fun for little girls .
That does n't get us anywhere .
When men lose , women lose – and vice versa .
The pendulum has swung too far .
After my story " Yelp and the Business of Extortion 2.0 " was published last month , Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman promptly launched into damage - control mode — and for good reason .
The story , which was picked up by national news outlets including The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal , detailed the accounts of local business owners who said that sales reps at the popular user - generated review site offered to move negative reviews of their businesses if they advertised .
Stoppelman immediately denied the allegations on Yelp 's official blog , criticizing my use of anonymous sources and the credibility of one on - the - record source .
A few days later , he posted another response , optimistically titled " East Bay Express Story Starts to Unravel . "
But the reality was just the opposite .
Since then , many business owners from around the country have come forward — via e-mails or comments on the Express ' web site — alleging similar tales of extortionist tactics by Yelp sales reps .
To make matters worse , Stoppelman 's handling of the allegations exposed the company 's blaring hypocrisy .
For example , he rebutted the story on Yelp 's blog , which , ironically , does n't allow comments .
Business owners contend that they just want the same opportunity to respond to negative , false , or damaging information about their businesses .
Instead , the only way for them to salvage their businesses ' reputation is by paying Yelp — regardless of whether the reviews are true or false .
Secondly , Stoppelman criticized my use of anonymous sources , calling it " fraught with hazards and ... strongly discouraged by most editors . "
Yet Yelp is a review site based entirely on anonymous sources .
Stoppelman claims
Yelp 's reviews are reasonably trustworthy because of the web site 's review filter , and because reviews may be suppressed if they 're not written by frequent Yelpers .
However , only the first name and last initial of the reviewer is posted , in some cases just initials , and in some cases fake names with no photos .
Frequently posting anonymously does not make one any less anonymous .
Because Stoppelman 's chief criticism of my article was that many of my sources were anonymous , for this follow - up I decided only to interview people who were willing to go on the record .
Their stories are no less damaging : several said that the reps would offer to move negative reviews if they advertised ; and in some cases positive reviews disappeared when they refused , or negative ones appeared .
In one case , a nightclub owner said Yelp offered positive reviews of his business in exchange for free drinks .
Barry Hyde , owner of M&M Auto Werkes in Campbell ( eleven reviews , 3.5 star rating ) , said that about a year ago , Yelp sales rep Jacqueline Fitzhugh called him to let him know that his business had a lot of positive reviews on Yelp .
" You can accentuate that with advertising , " he recalled Fitzhugh telling him .
Hyde declined , saying that he did n't want to spend the money .
This scenario , he says , went on for a few months .
Then , Hyde said he received a negative review from a legitimate customer .
He tried to rectify the situation with her , but to no avail .
Seven months later , Hyde said the customer 's boyfriend posted a negative review based on his girlfriend 's experience .
" I have an issue with that , " said Hyde , noting that third parties are n't allowed to post reviews as outlined by Yelp 's Terms of Service .
When he complained to Fitzhugh , he said she replied , " ' We can't control that , but if you advertise you can control the order that they 're in . '
So I could move those negative ones down to the bottom of my listing . "
Fitzhugh 's response unsettled Hyde .
So he said he contacted Stoppelman and told him , " What you 're doing is unethical " because Yelp does n't allow business owners to post their responses to negative reviews .
" We stopped talking for a while , " Hyde said .
" Then I notice some of my five - star posts are disappearing .
They said we have a spam filter like Google . "
Hyde tracked his reviews , printing them daily to monitor which ones would disappear .
Some stayed up for as short as 31 days and as long as 131 days — all were five - star reviews , he said .
Hyde said that Yelp told him that if he advertised , some of those five - star reviews would come back .
But that would n't make sense if they were truly being suppressed because of Yelp 's anti-spam algorithm .
" If these are bad people as you stated , why would I want them to come back ? " he wondered .
Hyde says he agreed to finally advertise with Yelp , but was then told his business was n't eligible for reasons they would n't disclose .
Calvin Gee of Haight Street Dental in San Francisco ( twenty reviews , 3.5 - star rating ) said he had five five - star reviews on Yelp when sales reps contacted him starting around the end of 2007 .
" They were kind of aggressive , " Gee recalled .
" I said no a couple times .
After I said no a bunch of times ... then I got negative reviews .
...
All of a sudden it dropped to 3.5 stars . "
Gee said one of the negative reviews was clearly written by a former employee he had fired .
He alerted his sales rep , who then removed it .
" They say they have an algorithm — that 's total bullshit , " he said .
According to Gee ,
Yelp sales reps told him that if he advertised , " they would remove the sponsored search of other dental offices on my page , and then they would let me choose my favorite review , and then they would move the negative reviews to the bottom of the page , " he said , noting that the last two options were distinctly different .
" And then they definitely said when I talked to them about the negative reviews , they said they would remove that — which they did . "
Exploring the issue further , Gee noticed that one of his competitors and an advertiser with Yelp , CitiDent , had two separate business listings on Yelp .
In what Gee believes is proof that Yelp kowtows to its advertisers , the business had more positive reviews and a higher star rating on the page that was marked as a Yelp sponsor , and more negative ( though different ) reviews and a lower star rating on the page that was not marked .
Gee printed up both pages , dated August 2008 , which he shared with this newspaper .
Today , CitiDent is no longer a Yelp advertiser and only has one page , on which both the positive and negative reviews from the two listings are combined .
On 20 July 1969 , mankind achieved something that as a collective it had been dreaming of for aeons .
A human being - in fact two - walked on the surface of the moon for the first time .
When Neil Armstrong spoke his immortal words as he descended the steps of the Eagle lunar module , he realised the vision of thousands of years of human imagination , and the more immediate effort of the thousands that had worked on the Apollo 11 programme .
While the 1960s and 70s marked the beginnings of the space age ' , the 1980s onwards have been known instead as the computer age .
While the layman would appreciate that the computer technology of the late 60s was undoubtedly primitive , they might be startled to realised how much so .
Computing power
In fact , the computing power that was present on board Apollo 11 was equivalent to that found in a very basic calculator of the early 1980s and far less powerful that the sorts of chip you 're likely to find inside an child 's electronic toy - a fact illustrated so vividly by this amusing advert for the National Geographic TV channel .
This is incredibly ironic , when you consider that some believe that Apollo 11 was the most complicated machine ever created by man , and that its successful launch and the safe return of the astronauts was therefore the greatest engineering achievement ever .
" The computer on the [ moon ] lander was 64Kb it's hard to imagine anything so small nowadays when your digital camera has a gigabyte and your mobile phone probably has the same , " said Pat Norris , who led the team that designed the navigation systems that controlled the orbit of the lunar module on Apollo 11 .
Speed speed speed !
I recently wrote in a review of the Revolution Wheelworks Rev-50 ’s that they were " maybe 95 % as good as Zipps , for 42 % of the price " .
Soon after I received a " very disappointed " email from Andy Paskins and Josh Poertner of Zipp .
Their contention was that a statement like this is very misleading , and was probably doing more to confuse the issue than clarify .
Also , the assertion that other brands were less expensive simply because the company spends less on marketing was downright maddening to the Zipp team who point out that they spend many times more money on R&D of new products and new technology than they do on marketing and team sponsorship combined .
I responded that I ’d tried for months to score an interview with lead design engineer Poertner to no avail , and had been more than eager to get Zipp ’s side of the story .
Soon after I scored my Poertner interview , complete with his assurance that all issues were open for discussion .
As it turns out , Poertner is beyond loquacious , even by our standards .
So what follows is a combination of direct quotes and paraphrasing , hopefully with no punches pulled despite the fact that Zipp have been one of our staunchest sponsors .
Zipp vs Asia
First we discussed the difference between Zipp and a company like Gigantex , the Taiwan based carbon manufacturer .
A rim like a 404 or an 808 has " about 150 wind tunnel hours at 900 bucks an hour , plus travel time , plus rapid prototype costs , from a clean sheet of paper to a finished product like the 808 , probably on the order of a half million dollars .
Between wind tunnel hours , R&D , development just on the rim shape , and all the parts you have to build to prove out the laminate , the layup , the testing , the safety testing , ride samples , ride testing …
By the time we cross the finish line on that you ’re well over half a million bucks in the hole . "
By contrast , an Asian manufacturer can take that rim , " and in three days you can have almost the exact rim shape copied .
The carbon wo n’t burn but the epoxy will , so what they do is they have these ovens that cook the rim at 800 degrees , and all the epoxy burns off and the layup ’s exposed …my half million development cost to get there the first time , plus 12 - 14 months , is probably backed up on their end by maybe 30 days start to finish , somewhere on the order of probably 12 to 15 thousand bucks . "
The upshot is that Gigantex can create an a la carte menu of rims .
Anyone can walk in , pick and choose from a list of options , and be up and running as a wheel company in a very short time .
I asked Poertner that if this was so , why would someone buy a Zipp instead of knockoff .
" Firstly , I really see us as developing a wheel system .
The rim , hub , spokes and nipples are specifically designed and manufactured to function together as a system .
So the hole drilling in the rim and in the hub are matched to actual spoke angles , every last gram of weight can be carved out of the hub if you know exactly how it will be used , every detail of the layup can be tuned to actual spoke count and stress .
Look at our hubs for example , nothing in the industry is close , we are running some of the lightest weight hubs , with the largest and widest flanges available , combined with the largest axle used in any road hub for added stiffness , proprietary bearings from Switzerland designed specifically for this application , and you have something really special that you are n’t going to get picking off the shelf parts from a vendor catalog .
Ultimately we are perceived as a product company , but at our core , we are a technology development company that does killer product .
I really see our place in this industry , as the guys who are driving full speed ahead on both product and technology development with a cost no object attitude , trying to find that next advantage for our customer , and trying to advance the technology as a whole .
I think there ’s a customer base out there that ’s willing to pay for that next incremental advantage , and to pay to have the latest greatest technology available .
Our target customer base is the customer to whom the product itself and the experience in using the product is greater than the incremental cost over our competition .
… at our core , we are a technology company that does killer product .
This is true with everything , look at cars , motorcycle , camera equipment , stereo equipment …all of these industries have technology leaders who disproportionately advance the whole industry through their innovation , and these companies are selling products that are expensive compared to much of the rest of the industry .
When you are a commodity focused company , your focus is on cost reduction , or at best on the cheapest possible way to add a technology that the customer demands , but when you are a technological leader , your focus is on achieving the next incremental advantage , improvement , or additional functionality and THEN determining if it can be fit into a cost structure that people can afford .
The other interesting angle on this analogy is that the technology leaders in all of these analogous industries are also never the most expensive option , that is always reserved for brands that offer fashion and exclusivity over being the most technologically advanced … and that is completely true in our industry .
At $ 2285 , a set of Zipp wheels is very expensive , but when you consider the playing field , I would say we are a bargain .
There are more than a dozen wheelsets on the market priced over $ 3000 and none of them can offer improvement over the competing Zipp wheel of similar depth .
A European magazine editor told me a few months ago that they were shocked to see us win their stiffness , bearing drag and aerodynamics categories when they thought we were mainly an aerodynamics company .
All in all , we were in the top 3 of every single category , and wheels in the test ranged between $ 1500 and $ 10,000 , so we were below both the mean and median price for the test . "
Poertner cites as an example of that cost no object attitude the fact that the 404 rim is in its 6th iteration in 7 years , the 808 in its 3rd in 5 years .
He says that Zipp will continually push forward in ways they hope their competition are n’t willing .
Next I asked Poertner about the 404’s new curved brake track , a carry over from the 808’s .
" Yeah , we ’ve had good luck with that .
That ’s a good example of a great Zipp product story … when you really think about it , the curved brake track presents some issues on the manufacturing side , like " how do you measure that for quality control ? "
A straight sided rim , you just put calipers on it all around .
But a curve , how do you measure a complex curve rotated about a central axis without a coordinate measuring machine ?
We developed that concept for the 808 in ’03 or ’ 04 , it was probably ’05 before we developed the really good generation of QC .
Now the rims that come off , they ’re all QC measured by a robot .
That , to me , is the essence of Zipp technology .
It ’s a real , measurable , quantifiable improvement in the technology behind the product , as well as in the product itself , as in the end , the new rims have better brake modulation and better wet performance as well as superior aerodynamics .
The dimples on the rim were a similar story , the product concept existed for 2 years while we developed the technology to manufacture the molding tools to actually make the rims .
We always say that anything worth doing comes at such an insanely high theshold of pain , but it ’s worth it .
We had to suffer like beaten dogs to figure this out , so anyone who wants to follow us , they have to figure it out too .
You can do curved brake track and not QC it , but man , you get killed .
Designing and engineering is a lot like bike racing .
It ’s not necessarily the guy who ’s straight up strongest , it ’s the smart , tactical guy who can suffer the most for the longest who gets the big wins .
That , to me , is what makes Zipp technology special , we develop every level of technology from the product concept , to the production and tooling technology to the quality control and measurement technology to make it possible .
The whole process is vertically integrated in one building and we control it all "
Zipp vs Mavic
When questioned about the competition between Zipp and Mavic , Poertner points out that the companies are really focusing on two different pieces of the market .
The story of Mavic wheels is all about weight and rotational inertia , while the story of Zipp wheels is focused on aerodynamics followed by weight , inertia and bearing efficiency .
" The more you look at inertia , inertia ’s just a second order phenomenon .
It ’s just not that important .
Aero is THE primary factor of wheel speed .
It ’s not weight , it ’s not inertia , it ’s aero .
Everything else is obviously huge in terms of nuance , but weight will save you a watt or two .
Inertia will save you a fraction of a watt to a watt .
Aero will save you 40 watts at certain speeds .
It ’s huge to go from a wheel like an R - Sys to a wheel like an 808 clincher which is a pound heavier , but it ’s about 50 watts more efficient at 30 mph .
But of course the problem is in the consumer ’s mind , 1350 grams vs 1680 grams , that has real tangible meaning to people .
Arguing about inertia seems tangible to people because they ’ve always heard that weight is important in wheels because it hits you twice .
There ’s just nothing tangible about aero . "
I asked Poertner about the fact that aero benefits are hard to quantify and easy to spin .
Many makers of aero wheels will cite wind tunnel data that claim their wheels are the fastest .
Mavic is about weight and rotational inertia , Zipp is focused on aerodynamics
" Yeah , that ’s the game .
One , aero testing is so expensive no one really wants to do it , and in the US media , that ’s too much of a political hand grenade ( Ed : to declare a definitive ‘ winner ’ wo n’t make you popular with your advertisers ) .
The only guys worldwide that I see doing legit wind tunnel testing is Tour Magazine in Germany .
Every year Tour Magazine takes a whole bunch of wheels to the tunnel and publishes the data .
The good news , for us , is that every year we win that test .
So in markets where that testing is done and the data exists , it really plays in our favor .
Even then , testing can be misleading , a company can take a single data point where they are strong and spin it into an entire marketing campaign , or a magazine test can run wheels at zero degrees yaw in the tunnel and come up with ‘ the fastest wheel ’ without disclosing that the condition they were testing for is a pretty low probability condition , but nobody wants to print ‘ the fastest wheel 4 % of the time ’
The other thing , the one factor that ’s been more beneficial to our company than any other is power meters .

Ceramic Bearings
Zipp stumbled onto ceramic bearings while building wheels for Jan Ullrich ’s 2000 Olympic effort .
A college friend of Poertner ’s was making incredible ceramic bearings for the Space Shuttle , and a connection was made .
By 2001 the Z series of wheels were launched , complete with ceramic bearings .
Today , the buzzword ‘ ceramic ’ is the fastest growing ‘ brand ’ in all of cycling , but a very misunderstood one .
The reality is 90 % of the ceramic bearings in cycling were never meant for this type of use .
" The reality is 90 % of the ceramic bearings in cycling were never meant for this type of use .
Why do ceramic bearings exist ?
In 90 % of the world it ’s for heat .
You get these cheaply made bearings that people put in parts that get hot , ’ cause you do n’t have all the thermal expansion issues that you get with steel .
Now you put them in a bike hub , and next thing you know , you ’ve got Zipp customers complaining that their hubs feel terrible or their bearings broke , or their races are pitted or cracking .
Suddenly the customer has a ‘ hub ’ problem .
Well , we ’ve never heard of a Zipp bearing ever fracturing , it just does n’t happen .
Then we come to find out , ‘ I spent $ 200 on Brand X bearings , so it must be your hub shell that ’s doing that !
‘ Cause these are CERAMIC !’
So in reality , the customer has now spent 200 bucks to downgrade their bearings two levels in quality , and have a failure .
It ’s pushing a boulder up a hill at that point .
‘ Ceramic ’ is a stronger brand than Campagnolo in terms of quality and inability to do wrong to the customer .
We see that all the time .
Our # 1 hub related warranty complaint is issues encountered after non-Zipp ceramic bearing ‘ upgrade ’ .
It just goes to show you the prevalence of that .
Just looking at that complaint data , probably 5 - 10 % of our customers are ‘ upgrading ’ to ceramic ??
And almost every one of those people is putting in something significantly worse than , or at best something equal to our stock bearing .
Meanwhile , the standard Zipp bearing is the only bearing in the industry sourced from Switzerland , uses the same ABEC5 races from the same factory as the CeramicSpeed ceramic upgrade for Zipp ( a $ 750 bearing upgrade ) and at $ 125 / set costs as much or more than most ‘ ceramic upgrades ’ . "
Zipp vs Hed
Steve
Hed , who jointly holds the toroidal rim patent with Zipp , once told me that Zipp hates him because they just ca n’t get their rim shapes right .
He says that while Zipp rims can produce a gaudy drag number at one yaw angle , Hed rims perform better over a wider range of yaw angles .
For Poertner , this anecdote garners a smile and a note that while the companies jointly hold the toroidal patent , before Zipp introduced the 808 in 2004 , neither company produced rims of this shape , and that before the 808 ventured to be 28 mm wide , neither company was making super wide toroidal rims that are now the staple of both companies .
He also points out that over the last few years the Hed rim shapes and wind tunnel data have started to look an awful lot like Zipp rim shapes and Zipp data .
Poertner also points out that Zipp was the one to develop the theory of real world wind angle probability and then set out to develop rim shapes that worked best in the conditions experienced most frequently .
… what we ’ve done is optimized and designed our rims to work at the angles you are most likely to experience on the road in the real world .
" Steve really believes that wind angles tend to run higher than lower .
You can go to the Hed site and there ’s a wind angle calculator .
Here ’s the rider and his direction and his speed , here ’s the wind and its direction and its speed , and you can calculate that instantaneous wind angle .
Now , to me , what ’s that given you , that ’s how you determine the max wind angle on that day , and there ’s a simple hand calculation for that , the inverse tangent of the wind speed over the rider speed .
So if you ’re riding at 20 mph , and you have a perpendicular wind speed of 10 mph , that yaw angle is 26 degrees .
So the way he looked at it is to say , ’ 10 mph is a common wind , 20 mph is a common rider speed , so 26 is the wind angle where we need to work ’ .
The way we worked at it , and this is based off a headtube mounted yaw probe that we built 6 or 7 years ago combined with mathematical modeling , was to say that ’s the case when the wind is exactly perpendicular to you , but the road turns , the rider turns , the wind changes , the wind speed at the ground is n’t necessarily the same as where it ’s higher , so there is so much more to the story than the 26 degrees ..
You talk to the weather service and they ’ll tell you that average wind condition at any given time during the day is about 8 mph in some direction .
Well , that ’s on a weather service pole , a 3 meter pole .
So you ’re probably a touch slower at the ground .
But even at 8 or 10 mph , how often are you riding an out and back where the wind is perfectly perpendicular to you ?
So we started to determine true wind angle probability of occurrence .
What you find in most circumstances is you get a bell curve with zero and max wind angle at the two ends .
( Actually the zipp model is two bell curves running from –peak angle to + peak angle with 0 in the middle , and 2 small bell curves , but for simplicity is depicted as just being 0 - peak angle and a single curve ) .
In the more modern era we do this with GPS where we can plot actual rider speed and direction and overlay the wind data from the weather service … this allows us to plot the exact distribution of wind angles , and we continue to find that the data matches the original model we discussed in our white paper on this back in 2002 - 2003 .
So back to Hed .
He ’s in the camp saying 26 degrees , and we say 26 is the max , but if I run that and plot the curve , 13 is the most likely , it ’s the highest probability .
So that ’s where we really diverge .
What we found , and we backed it up with this headtube mounted probe that we rode the heck out of and collected the data for months , real world wind angle probability falls between 7 and 15 degrees .
If you ’re slower it runs higher and vice versa .
It ’s very rare that you ’re going to have a most likely wind angle of 20 or higher , ’ cause that means your peak wind angle is going to be 40 or more , and to get there you either have to be going really slow , or have really ridiculous wind speeds , at which point most people are going to opt for shallow wheels .
So the way Steve calculates really works favorably to the 3 spoke wheel , ’ cause that wheel is pretty average ’ til 20 degrees , then it ’s super fast between 20 and 35 .
So that works really well to say , ‘ Hey , you ’re an age group triathlete , run this wind angle , you ’re going to be in the 20’s , and this wheel going to be the fastest in the 20’s . ’
The way I look at that , looking at the wind angle probability , that same age grouper that he ’s considering at 26 degree yaw , we are considering , by the first deviation , is going to be roughly between 9 and 17 degrees .
And that ’s a whole other story , because between 9 and 17 degrees there ’s a whole host of wheels that are a lot faster .
So , with our rim shapes and our wind tunnel testing , what we ’ve done is optimized and designed our rims to work at the angles you are most likely to experience on the road in the real world .
Designing a rim is like designing an aircraft wing , right ?
With enough time and enough money we can make it optimal wherever we choose .
And we believe this more reality based statistical probability model of wind angle , we really shoot to be peak efficiency between 10 and 15 degrees , and have your peak minimum drag in that range .
And I think the reality , the GPS data , the teams testing it , the power measurements off the bike , time seems to be proving our picture of wind angle probability to be more correct .
And I would say the market is rewarding that , the pro teams are definitely rewarding that .
Six teams in the Tour were using Zipp products this year yet Zipp lists only 3 official team relationships .
We work with the teams that are doing the testing , that are interested in technology , the ones for whom the data and expertise we bring is worth more than the money other companies can offer . "
Backstedt at Paris Roubaix
Speaking of working with pro teams , I asked Poertner about the PR fiasco that was Magnus Backstedt ’s Paris Roubaix of ’ 08 , where he broke both his 303 ’s and DNF’d .
" The Backstedt incident was brutal PR , when we first started working with CSC back in 2004 , Trek ’s team Liasion Scott Daubert told me ‘ Remember , no matter what happens to make something break , it is always seen as the manufacturers fault . ’
So I joke with Scott Daubert at Trek , it was n’t quite as bad as Hincapie ’s steerer tube , but it sure felt about as bad when it happened .
But that is a lot of what drove a lot of the initial discussions into what became Cervelo Test Team . "
Poertner ’s point is that they needed a team over which they had complete control .
They had tested the 303 to be cobble proof with 27 mm tires , going so far as casting actual cobbles to create a bump drum for testing .
" We literally had thousands of engineering hours in trying to build cobble proof wheels .
The problem with cobble proof wheels is , in a week we could build a rim that could survive the cobbles , but with carbon , the stiffness of the material is so high that as you add strength you ’re inevitably adding stiffness .
Our rim shapes are tuneable , the toroidal shape gives you a leaf spring effect , we can add damping materials to damp vibration , we can control to some extent the sidewall spring rate , but the reality is that at some point the wheel just gets so stiff that the guys do n’t want to ride them , particularly as the bikes are already so overbuilt for that race so that none of those component manufacturers risk failure either .
That whole process led to the carbon bridge technology , which is that Kevlar sewn rim edge , which has led to huge perimeter efficiencies in term of strength and stiffness per weight within that very localized region .
But it did n’t affect the whole rim , so we raised the impact strength 30 + % , but the stiffness of the rim only went up a couple percent . "
However , the day of the race turned out to be dry , so Backstedt decided to run 24 mm tires at 72 psi ( 5 bar ) , an untested combination for his 210 lb weight .
Zipp later replicated those conditions at the lab and cracked the rims each time .
" I was on the phone with him a few days after it happened , and he said in the six times he ’d done Roubaix , he broke or cracked wheels in five of them .
The one time he did n’t was the time he won , and he said afterwards those wheels were bent with hairline cracks at almost every nipple hole .
The upside of aluminum is that it will bend long before it cracks , and you can keep riding a bent wheel .
He told me then that we ’d probably never see carbon at Roubaix again .
So it ’s that fine line of ‘ the ideal race car is the one that falls apart inches after the finish line ’ .
That ’s the hole we ’re in , but to this day I ’m confident that if he ’d run 27 ’s that day as he had in our testing we would n’t have an issue . "
The flip side of that story , which went largely unreported , was that Martin Maaskant rode a stock set of 202 ’s with with 24 mm tires that day and finished 4th , the first ever finish at Roubaix for a carbon wheel .
" It was tearing us up , first ever finish , fourth place , on a bone stock nothing special 202…a CLIMBING wheel of all things .
Of course , he ’s a 155 pound guy , so on 24 mm tires at that pressure it ’s a totally different dynamic .
For me , it was made that much more painful by the way the press hung the failure on Zipp , exactly as Daubert had predicted .
The reality however , was that Backstedt and Hincapie , were wheel to wheel in the Arenberg forest and both broke their wheels within feet of each other .
Hincapie shattered a pair of Hed ’s and we never saw a word about it anywhere in the media .
And this year , coming back , Hincapie , on Columbia , ( sponsored by Hed but running mostly Zipp ) , rode a very traditional aluminum setup . "
Finally , this year in Roubaix Zipp had 16 sets of 303’s , and not one single issue .
Hushovd reported that he had the most perfect wheel setup he ’d ever experienced at that race .
Pro Riders and Wheel Choice
We talked about several instances where pro riders chose wheels out of feel , intuition , or superstition instead of science , starting with Kristin Armstrong at the Olympic TT , where she rode a flat disk instead of a Sub 9 .
Poertner calculated that the heavier Sub 9 would ’ve cost Armstrong a second or two uphill , but would ’ve gained 5 or 6 downhill .
" And the thing she came back with , really struck me , she said , ‘ the downhill is so technical I feel so speed limited by grip and bike handling , so any aero benefit I ’m going to pick up on the downhill with that wheel , is going to be negated by the brakes regardless . ’
So that ’s one of those situations where we can run the computer model , but it ca n’t decide how much to brake coming into the corner .
The other piece of that that ’s hard to ferret out is rider confidence .
Having ridden both disks a ton , I feel like I can corner faster on a Sub 9 than a 900 , because of the suppleness .
The rim bulge acts like a leaf spring and makes it ride more like a spoked wheel . "
We also spoke about Cancellara and the Sub 9 .
He initially rode the Sub 9 on a Cervelo P3 , and with the tight fit at the chainstays , he was able to make the wheel rub .
Though chainstay rub is due to frame , not wheel , flex , Cancellara came to believe the Sub 9 was too flexy .
It was n’t until he switched to the Specialized Shiv , with its wider chainstay clearance , that he began to appreciate the Sub 9 .
" He ’d done some testing on it , and we were on a conference call , ‘ It ’s amazing , it corners like a spoked wheel , it ’s so comfortable ! ’
He just loves that thing . "
Cancellara went on to win the Tour Prologue on the Sub9 and finish second in Annecy on the same setup at this year ’s Tour .
Another example is Carlos Sastre , who rode 202 ’s almost every day at the ’08 Tour , despite computer models that indicated that he could ’ve hit the base of Alpe d’Huez with 250 calories in reserve if he rode 303’s .
" For a rider like him , the last couple of his big victories have been on 202’s , so there ’s this internal confidence in that particular wheelset that ’s so high , that I ’m not going to take it away from him .
At some point , there ’s a mental benefit that ’s as great as the performance benefit between these two subtly different products .
It ’s not like we ’re having them pick 303 ’s over aluminum training wheels .
It ’s much more nuanced than that .
I mean , 808 ’s are heavy compared to 202 ’s but they ’re still really light compared to almost everything on the market .
The 808 tubular weighs the same as a Campy Bora , but if you talk to the Campy teams , they look at that as the Bora as a climbing wheel , ’ cause that ’s what they ’ve got .
Our teams are a little bit spoiled .
They ’ve got the full range of five depths , multiple disks , they have the whole thing at their disposal , and they have all the data to make it meaningful .
It can certainly lead to paralysis by analysis , but for the riders who are interested and are technical , it ’s a huge benefit for them . "
Cancellara and 808’s
" One of my all time favorite stories of dealing with the teams , two years ago , going to the Tour , I arrived at the team hotel in a little town the day Fabian won the Tour stage into Compiegne with that 1 k solo .
I ’d been on the road all day , did n’t even realize what happened , and there was a big celebration .
And Fabian got up , gave me a big hug , and he said , ‘ 808 is the new 404 for me !’.
So excited .
We ’d been in the wind tunnel just a couple months earlier , he agreed to be the guinea pig , and we ’d never had an athlete do this , he agreed to just sit on the bike and let us put every different wheel under him .
But it showed him the drag difference , and calculating that back into watts , and we showed him .
We put a pair of 3 spokes under him , and he saw that they ’re essentially a little slower than 404’s , but his 808 ’s had them by 20 grams or so .
Jens Voigt had been riding the 808 ’s quite a bit at that time and was quite a believer , so the guys were interested , but they just had n’t made the leap yet .
One of the things he said , which kinda struck me to this day , ‘ I just felt like when I went , I knew I was riding a TT bike compared to what these other guys were on . ’
He ’s right .
You look at the numbers , that Cervelo he was on , with those wheels , compared to what the other guys were riding at that speed , WAS a big advantage .
Of course , on top of that you have power and tactics , all that stuff comes into play , but for all of us , that was a huge insight into the emotional , psychological advantage of , ‘ Wow , I do n’t just feel fast today , I have the greatest tools I can have .
If those guys are going to catch me they ’re going to have to make significantly more watts . ’
That , in and of itself , is an advantage . "
Wheelbuilding and QC
I had a 404 front wheel built to 60kg of spoke tension , and an 808 front at 110 kg .
I asked Poertner why there could be such an inconsistency .
" We do n’t have that many builders , six wheelbuilders ?
All by hand , and every builder ’s responsible for quality control , spoke tension measured every wheel , 100 % .
There are protocols and procedures , but mistakes can certainly be made as with anything , but on average our wheelbuilders have each built thousands of wheels .
I ’d say our quality tends to be at the top of our industry .
But things definitely happen once in a while that are not of our ideal .
Our goal is to eliminate as many opportunities for mistakes to be made and to put systems in place that produce the highest quality product with great consistency .
Every year we talk with hundreds of dealers and they reports that our quality and consistency are at the top of the industry , but of course , mistakes can still be made .
We ’re actually stepping it up to the next level , going to a digital database ( SPC ) using a digital reader on the spoke tensionometer , so it can kick out a meaningful number into the database .
Every wheel will have a huge list of data linked to its serial number .
The goal is to be able to pull up a serial number and see exactly every spoke tension when it left the factory .
See the trueness , see the roundness , have it digitized .
It ’s exciting and a ridiculous pain in the ass .
You can imagine what that costs … but we feel it important . "
Durability , Cost
Finally , we addressed what I consider a major bugaboo with carbon wheels : durability .
I ’ve cracked 4 Zipps this year , 2 due to operator error ( sprinting straight into a pothole in a race started in total darkness ) , and 2 while supposedly JRA ( just riding along ) .
Poertner described a process that every Zipp sales and customer service employee goes through .
A steel bar is laid down in the parking lot , and everyone has to ride over it and break a wheel .
What they find is that the pass that does n’t break the wheel hurts more than the one that does , since energy is absorbed as the rim cracks .
So if you think you broke a rim while just riding along , it ’s probably because the rim sucked up the impact and lowered the perceived impact .
He also discussed how Zipp ’s long history in carbon can work against them – if you make wheels long enough , eventually everyone will know someone with a broken Zipp story , or heard it on an internet forum .
Finally , he addressed the cost / durability issue :
" Design and engineering , everything you do has some tradeoff somewhere .
The product we put out now really shows that we try to take as much tradeoff out of the product as possible , and the place where we do have to give it up is the cost .
You just have to suck it up .
Take carbon bridge .
We ’ve invested a fortune in this technology , both in terms of developing the concept and testing prototypes ( more than 300 wheels tested to failure in the lab ) , developing the technology and equipment to produce the rim , researching the vendors , and it ’s expensive .
It adds quite a lot of cost to every rim , but the weight penalty ’s only 6 grams per rim , the strength went up dramatically , the stiffness is improved , so our only tradeoff is cost .
And we think our customer is willing to pay for that cost .
It ’s one thing to show up to the market and tell it , ‘ You ’re going to pay an extra $ 100 because we want you to , but we show up to the market and we say , ‘ We did all this stuff to make this product better , stronger , stiffer , and we did n’t add any weight to it .
But to do that we had to develop all this technology , and the cost of that technology has raised the wheelset $ 100 . ’
To me , a wise and interested market responds positively to that , and they did to carbon bridge .
It ’s been one of the most successful technologies we ’ve released .
We see it here , crash replacements , impact damage to rims , is just , I wo n’t say non-existent , but it ’s very , very low .
We ’ve seen almost no failures from the pro teams this years with Carbon Bridge and I ’ve heard numerous times this year from dealers that they are seeing less crash replacement with us than our competitors , even though they are selling more of our products .
But of course when you have 21 years of product on the market , and you are the company that invented the carbon rim , it ’s going to take a long time for anecdotes about rim durability to change .
As of today , the data and testing show us that nobody is making a more impact resistant or durable rim , and certainly nobody is even close when you factor in aero performance and weight . "
By Community Correspondent Stephen Evans
Wandsworth council came in for a fair amount of stick when they sacked Duke Amachree for gross misconduct after he imposed his religion on a member of the public seeking his professional help .
Now the case of Mr Amachree has been taken up by the Christian Legal Centre ( CLC ) who is taking the case to an employment tribunal , claiming that Wandworth ’s decision effectively ' privatises ' Christian faith and is against Mr Amachree ’s human rights .
We can surely all agree that everyone should have the right to believe whatever they want and practise whatever faith they so wish .
However , should employees have the right to impose their religion on others ?
I would say an emphatic no - especially when they ’re providing a public service that serves the whole community , funded by public money .
Despite the claims of the evangelicals , this is not a denial of human rights and it has little to do with freedom of speech .
It ’s about professional working practises , good manners and protecting people from evangelisers like Mr Amachree .
Employees in such cases are happy to complain about their rights , but no mention of rights should be made without reference to responsibilities .
The Christian Legal Centre ( CLC ) , who are backing Mr Amachree , are behind a well funded and well orchestrated campaign to misinform us all into believing that Christians are being persecuted in the UK .
This is of course complete nonsense .
The fact of the matter is that Christianity is in rapid decline and the Church is fast losing its influence in an increasingly secular society .
Some Christians may not like it , but it ’s hardly persecution .
Take a look at the high profile case of Nadia Eweida , who was portrayed in the press as the victim of cruel religious discrimination - a poor persecuted Christian who had been " banned " by British Airways from wearing a simple cross at work .
When the CLC and Nadia Eweida took BA to tribunal , they lost .
The Employment Tribunal kicked out every one of her claims of discrimination saying she “ generally lacked empathy for the perspective of others ” and “ her own overwhelming commitment to her faith led her at times to be both naive and uncompromising in her dealings with those who did not share her faith . "
The CLC lawyer then was Paul Diamond , a familiar figure in court cases demanding religious privilege , who will also be making the case for Duke Amachree .
Mr Amachree was sacked following a disciplinary where it was revealed that he gave ‘ wholly inappropriate and unprofessional advice to a very sick person who has an incurable illness , which caused great upset and distress ’ .
By his own admission he suggested to the woman , who came to him seeking housing advice , that she should put her faith in God and that ‘ sometimes the doctors do n't have all of the answers ’ .
He went on to suggest that she should believe in ‘ miracles ’ .
Mr Amachree is free to believe whatever superstitious mumbo jumbo he wants to , but he should not be entitled to peddle such beliefs whilst being paid by Wandsworth Council to give professional housing advice .
Mr Amachree may well be “ stunned ” by the actions of Wandsworth Council , but that just goes to show the arrogance of certain evangelicals who demand the right to impose their religion on others .
This is not about gagging Christians , it ’s about principles .
I ’d be saying the same if a Muslim , Jew , Sikh , atheist or anyone else tried to impose their religious or political beliefs on others in this way .
Common sense should always be applied in such cases , but employers must be permitted to declare their workplaces secular spaces and request that employees leave their religion at the door .
They can still apply their Christian values at work ( providing , of course , that they comply with their employer ’s equality policies ) but the religiously motivated need to modify their language and translate their concerns into universal , rather than religion - specific , values .
And if employers refuse or feel their religion does n't permit them to work in the way that the job demands , then an employer should have the right to ask them to find another job that does .

Riddick director David Twohy gave the world an update on the eagerly anticipated third Riddick movie .
The good news is , both Twohy and Vin are n't settling for any PG - 13 nonsense , and the new film will be closer to Pitch Black .
Advertisement
In an interview with Shock Til You Drop Twohy explained what we have to look forward to , besides more glorious , graphic bloodshed .
" Vin and I have decided on one approach of those two , and there 's some interest at the studio level but it would be as a PG - 13 film , and we do n't want to do that anymore .
That 's one of the concessions we thought we made with ' Riddick ' that we should n't have made ....
The third movie would be more modestly - scaled and it would probably feel more like Pitch Black than Chronicles [ of Riddick ] .
It will always be Riddick - centric . "

And he says the film will focus more on the characters and how they deal with their tense situation , the same way Pitch did .
There 's nothing more refreshing than reading a director talk about something everyone is super excited about , with actual insight and self - awareness .
Chronicles , although amazing , did tackle a bit too much material , I 'm happy to see that Vin and Twohy are focused and ready to deliver .

* Cheney calls investigation bad for national security
* McCain concerned about effect on CIA morale
WASHINGTON , Aug 30 ( Reuters ) - Former Vice President Dick Cheney said he might refuse to speak with a prosecutor investigating suspected CIA prisoner abuses , a probe he branded as political and bad for national security .
Cheney has been one of the fiercest critics of U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder 's decision last week to name a new special prosecutor to look deeper into harsh interrogations of captured terrorism suspects during the Bush administration .
Asked whether he would talk to prosecutor John Durham if eventually sought out , Cheney told " Fox News Sunday " : " It will depend on the circumstances and what I think their activities are really involved in .
I 've been very outspoken in my views on this matter . "
The cases under investigation include a mock execution , use of a power drill to scare a prisoner and the waterboarding of accused Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed 183 times .
" I'm very proud of what we did in terms of defending the nation for the past eight years , successfully , " Cheney said in a recorded interview .
" And it wo n't take a prosecutor to find out what I think .
I 've already expressed those views . "
Cheney said he did not know at the time which methods were used in specific cases but defended the interrogators , saying " the enhanced interrogation techniques were absolutely essential in saving thousands of American lives . "
The decision to name a prosecutor could create political headaches for President Barack Obama and distract lawmakers from his drive to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system .
On Sunday , Republican lawmakers renewed their concerns about the investigation while one of Obama 's key allies sought to distance the president from Holder 's decision .
Democratic Senator John Kerry said he believed " there 's a little bit of a tension between the White House itself and the lawyers and the Justice Department .
" And in a sense , that 's good , that 's appropriate , because it shows that we have an attorney general who is not pursuing a political agenda but who is doing what he believes the law requires him to do , " Kerry told ABC's " This Week . "
Prominent Republicans including Senator John McCain , a former presidential candidate and torture survivor during the Vietnam War , said they were concerned about the investigation 's impact on morale at the CIA .
A Washington Post report on Sunday cited former intelligence officials saying CIA morale was sagging .

The introduction of SpaceCollective briefly mentions the incredible Nikola Tesla .
I recently did a little bit of research into the life of the man and holy # ^ ( $ -!t.
For those of you who are unaware of who Nikola Tesla was , I suggest you enlighten yourself by reading up - or at least you - tubing up on his life .
All sources I found assert that upon his death the government went in and snatched up all of his notes and inventions - some of which are still being analyzed today .
Many of the sources also assert that he did n't write down a lot of his findings for this reason , to block his discoveries from being exploited .
It is clear by some of his inventions - like ( free ) global wireless electricity , death rays , and radio ( among a lot of others we still utilize today ) this guy knew something about the universe the average joe does not .
I 've decided I am going to start hitting the books a little bit harder - maybe we can solve the energy crisis with free electric energy from the ionosphere ?
Haha , no ... Seriously .
But what did Nikola Tesla know ?!

Method arguments in Ruby are interesting because of the great flexibility in how you ’re allowed to supply them to methods .
Ruby method arguments can loosely be broken up into two categories , required arguments and optional arguments .
However , I like to break them up into three categories ( I hope it will become clear by the end of this post why I do so ) :
required arguments
arguments with default values
optional arguments
Required Arguments
These are just your stock standard method arguments , e.g. :
def some_method ( a , b ) end
To call the method above you will need to supply two arguments to the method call , e.g. :
some_method ( 25 , " hello " )
Pretty basic stuff , nothing much to see here , moving on :) .
Arguments With Default Value
In Ruby you can supply a default value for an argument .
This means that if a value for the argument is n’t supplied , the default value will be used instead , e.g. :
def some_method ( a , b , c=25 ) end
You may call the method above in one of two ways :
some_method ( 25 , " hello " )
or
some_method ( 25 , " hello " , 48 )
In the first case you do n’t supply a value for the third parameter , so it ’s default value ( i.e. 25 ) will be used in the method body .
In the second case you do supply a value , so it will be used in place of the default value .
Therefore , arguments with default values are a type of optional argument .
Optional Arguments
If you want to decide at runtime how many – if any – arguments you will supply to a method , Ruby allows you to do so .
You need to use a special notation when you define the method , e.g. :
def some_method ( *p ) end
You can call the above method with any number of arguments ( including none ) , e.g. :
some_method
or
some_method ( 25 )
or
some_method ( 25 , " hello " , 45 , 67 )
All of those will work .
If no arguments are supplied , then p will be an empty array , otherwise , it will be an array that contains the values of all the arguments that were passed in .
So , far it is all pretty basic stuff .
The real fun begins when you need to mix and match the three types of arguments together .
Mixing And Matching The Various Types Of Arguments
What happens when you start to mix required arguments with optional arguments ?
Do they have to be in any specific order , and what gets assigned to what ?
The easiest case is mixing a number of required arguments with the fully optional argument ( i.e. the * notation ) , e.g. :
def some_method ( a , b , * p ) end
You can call the above method with two or more values .
The first two values will be assigned to arguments a and b , the rest will be assigned to p as an array , pretty simple .
But , what if I wanted to do the following :
def some_method ( a , b , * p , q ) end
In this case , you can call the above method with 3 or more values .
When you call the above method , the required arguments get assigned first and if there are still any values left over they get assigned as an array to the optional argument , e.g. :
some_method( 25,35,45,55 ) - a=25 , b=35 , p= [ 45 ] , q=55
some_method( 25,35,45 ) - a=25 , b=35 , p=[ ] , q=45
some_method( 25,35,45,55,65,75 ) - a=25 , b=35 , p=[45,55,65 ] , q=75
Notice that the required arguments get assigned the value that corresponds to their order in the argument list , while the optional argument gets all the values that are left over that correspond to it ’s order in the list .
Things can get even more involved if we introduce arguments with default values :
def some_method ( a , b , c=5 , * p , q ) end
In this case you can still call the above method with three or more values .
When you make a call , all required arguments must get a value assigned , if there are more values left over , then the arguments with default values will get a value assigned to them , after that if there is still something left over , the optional argument will get those values as an array , e.g. :
some_method( 25,35,45 ) - a=25 , b=35 , c=5 , p= [ ] , q=45
some_method( 25,35,45,55 ) - a=25 , b=35 , c=45 , p= [ ] , q=55
some_method( 25,35,45,55,65 ) - a=25 , b=35 , c=45 , p= [ 55 ] , q=65
some_method( 25,35,45,55,65,75 ) - a=25 , b=35 , c=45 , p= [ 55,65 ] , q=75
Once again all arguments get assigned the values that correspond to their order in the argument list .
And the arguments with a default value will get something assigned to them ( if possible ) before the fully optional argument gets any values .
It ’s all pretty cool and it might seem like you can do anything with argument lists in Ruby , but there are some things to look out for .
The only real hard and fast rule to remember is when you ’re mixing optional parameters and default value parameters in the argument list .
In this case , all default value parameters must occur before the optional parameter in the list , e.g. :
def some_method ( a , b=5 , * p ) - correct
def some_method ( a , * p , b=5 ) - incorrect !!!
If your optional parameter occurs before your default one , it is a syntax error , which makes sense if you think about it .
And obviously , it makes no sense to have two optional arguments in an argument list ( i.e. two parameters with * notation ) .
Feel free to leave a comment if you know of any other interesting things or caveats when it comes to Ruby method arguments .

The colour maps are the most detailed yet ( Image : Nasa / JPL / Space Science Institute )

The stunning maps were pieced together by researchers from images taken by the Cassini spacecraft as it approached Jupiter on 11 and 12 December 2000 .
Raw images exist in only two colours so the maps were coloured to show how Jupiter would appear to the naked eye .
They consist of one cylindrical map of the planet along with north and south polar maps of Jupiter .
The maps were created from 36 frames captured by Cassini as it passed the giant planet on a gravity assist manoeuvre to get it to Saturn .
Cassini arrived in Saturn orbit on 1 July 2004 .
Chaotic scene
The maps show a variety of colourful cloud features , including parallel reddish - brown and white bands , the Great Red Spot , multi-lobed chaotic regions , white ovals and many small vortices .
Many clouds appear in streaks and waves due to continual stretching and folding by Jupiter 's winds and by turbulence .

Recently , astronomers have noted that Jupiter appears to be " growing " another red spot , which they have nicknamed " Red Jr " .
Both red spots are actually raging storms in Jupiter 's cloud layer , but scientists do n't yet know how they get their characteristic brick colour .
Jupiter 's Great Red Spot is twice as wide as our planet and at least 300 years old .
The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of Nasa , the European Space Agency ( Esa ) and the Italian Space Agency ( Asi ) .
