I want­ed to alert you to a very inter­est­ing find­ing pub­lished in a recent issue of Sci­ence , one of the world ’s lead­ing sci­en­tif­ic jour­nals .
The study was led by Dr. Torkel Kling­berg and his col­leagues from the Karolin­s­ka Insti­tute in Swe­den .
The goal was to learn whether Work­ing Mem­o­ry Train­ing is asso­ci­at­ed with changes in brain bio­chem­istry , thus sug­gest­ing a mech­a­nism by which train­ing may lead to enhanced work­ing mem­o­ry capac­i­ty and a reduc­tion in atten­tion prob­lems .
Thus , although Work­ing Mem­o­ry Train­ing has pre­vi­ous­ly shown promis­ing results as a treat­ment for work­ing mem­o­ry and atten­tion dif­fi­cul­ties , this was a basic sci­ence study rather than a treat­ment study .
The major find­ing was that increased work­ing mem­o­ry capac­i­ty fol­low­ing train­ing was asso­ci­at­ed with changes in brain bio­chem­istry .
Specif­i­cal­ly , the researchers found changes in the den­si­ty and bind­ing poten­tial of cor­ti­cal D1 dopamine recep­tors in brain regions that are acti­vat­ed dur­ing work­ing mem­o­ry tasks .
Results from this study sug­gest a bio­log­i­cal basis for the improve­ment in work­ing mem­o­ry capac­i­ty and reduc­tions in atten­tion prob­lems that have been demon­strat­ed in sev­er­al ran­dom­ized con­trolled tri­als of Work­ing Mem­o­ry Train­ing .
In addi­tion to this pos­si­ble treat­ment impli­ca­tion , this is the first demon­stra­tion that cog­ni­tive train­ing mod­i­fies basic aspects of brain bio­chem­istry at the lev­el of recep­tor cells .
Thus , it is an espe­cial­ly inter­est­ing basic sci­ence find­ing in that it shows that brain bio­chem­istry can be mod­i­fied by expe­ri­ence .

Adaptation Trumps Fitness In Evolution Simulation , Says Study
Adaptation is one of the driving forces behind evolution , along with selection and the appearance of new species , say a group of Ludwig - Maximilians - Universität München researchers , but they say that the interpretation familiar since Darwin - these processes increase the " fitness " of the species overall , since , of two competing species , only the fittest would survive - is actually a case of the fittest being the ' weakest ' most often .
The extinction of species is a consequence of their inability to adapt to new environmental conditions , and also of their competition with other species , say LMU researchers who simulated the progression of a cyclic competition of three species , meaning that each participant is superior to one other species , but will be beaten by a third interaction partner .
" In this kind of cyclical concurrence , the weakest species proves the winner almost without exception , " reports Professor Erwin Frey , who headed the study .
" The two stronger species , on the other hand , die out , as experiments with bacteria have already shown .
Our results are not only a big surprise , they are important to our understanding of evolution of ecosystems and the development of new strategies for the protection of species . "
Ecosystems are composed of a large number of different species , which interact and compete with one another for scarce resources .
This competition between species in turn affects the probability with which the individual can reproduce and survive – a matter of life and death , as it were .
All of these processes are also largely probabilistic and lead to fluctuations that ultimately lead to the extinction of species .
We know that up to 50 species become extinct every day on Earth , which at this high rate can be attributed to the influence of man .
Yet , the phenomenon of extinction of species itself cannot be avoided altogether – and is still only barely understood .
Theoretical ecologists and biophysicists are therefore intensively researching conditions and mechanisms that affect the biodiversity of Earth .
Cyclic dominance is a particularly interesting constellation of species competing with each other .
It means that each participant is superior to one other interaction partner , but will be beaten by a third .
In ecosystems , this would be three subpopulations – in the simplified model – which dominate in turn .
In fact , communities of subpopulations following such rules have been identiﬁed in numerous ecosystems , ranging from coral reef invertebrates to lizards in the inner Coast Range of California .
Such cyclical interaction is also familiarly termed " rock - paper - scissors " interaction .
This is where the rock blunts the scissors , which cut the paper , which in turn wraps around the rock .
Together , these non-hierarchical relationships form a cyclical motion .
" The game can help describe the diversity of species , " explains Frey .
" The background is a branch of mathematics called game theory , and in this case evolutionary game theory .
It helps analyze systems that involve multiple actors whose interactions are similar to those in parlor games . "
Using game theory , one can also study the collective development of populations .
In their study , the scientists working with Frey developed elaborate computer simulations in order to calculate the probabilities with which species in cyclical competition will survive .
The games started off with three species coexisting in the systems , and ran until two species became extinct – with the third being the only remaining survivors .
" What we saw was that in large populations , the weakest species would – with very high probability – come out as the victor , " says Frey .
This " law of the weakest " even held true when the difference between the competing species was slight .
" This result was just as unexpected for us , " reports Frey .
" But it shows once more that chance plays a big part in the dynamics of an ecosystem .
Incidentally , in experiments that were conducted a couple of years ago on bacterial colonies , in order to study cyclical competition , there was one clear result :
The weakest of the three species emerged victorious from the competition . "
The project was supported by the cluster of excellence " Nanoinitiative Munich ( NIM ) " , of which Professor Erwin Frey is a principal investigator .
Meeting in D.C. , GOP governors look to 2012 race GOP governors look to 2012 presidential race
On one side were Southern governors — including Bobby Jindal of Louisiana , Haley Barbour of Mississippi and Mark Sanford of South Carolina .
All three are outspoken critics of Obama ’s $ 787 billion plan to jolt the economy through investment in education , health care and transportation and have said they are likely to reject some of the stimulus funding .
Jindal and Sanford are considered likely presidential candidates in 2012 , but have demurred when asked about their future endeavors .
On the other side were the coastal moderates — including Florida Gov. Charlie Crist and California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger — who have embraced Obama ’s stimulus plan as an important , if imperfect , means of bringing their states out of recession .
In the middle is another likely 2012 contender , Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty , who has criticized the stimulus bill but nonetheless plans to accept the money for his state .
Not present at the governor ’s meeting was Alaska ’s Sarah Palin , arguably the GOP ’s biggest star .
John McCain ’s running mate is viewed as a top prospect for 2012 — but that does n’t mean other governors are standing by .
Sanford , 48 , the stimulus bill ’s most ardent opponent among governors , acknowledged Sunday that there “ may not be much of a national appetite right now ” for his strict anti-spending philosophy .
He said it was all part of his commitment to bedrock conservative values , which he believes are the key to a Republican resurgence .
“ For Republicans , it ’s the larger conservative theme of walking the walk on taxes and spending . ”
Jindal , at 37 one of the nation ’s youngest governors , echoed Sanford ’s view that the GOP failed by straying from core principles .
“ Our Republican Party got fired with cause these last two election cycles .
We became the party that defended spending , corruption that we never should ’ve tolerated , and we stopped offering relevant solutions to the problems that Americans care about , ” Jindal told NBC ’s Meet the Press .
Crist , 52 , who campaigned with Obama in Florida to pass the stimulus , hinted that Republicans might be making a mistake by defining themselves in opposition to the plan .
“ In the Florida way , we work together in a bipartisan fashion to do what ’s right for the people , ” Crist said on Meet the Press .
While Pawlenty , 48 , refused to say whether he ’d run in 2012 , he also expressed frustration with the GOP for failing to appeal to a broader cross-section of voters .
“ Whoever runs needs to bring a fresher voice and face to the party . ”
A Bellview , Washington guy was in his basement when he heard burglars break in upstairs .
He called 911 , then sneaked outside .
He saw the burglar 's van parked in front of his house with the engine running , so he hopped in and drove it away , leaving the burglars without a getaway vehicle .
The burglars took off on foot , leaving a pile of televisions , a laptop and a jewelry box by the door .
A witness who was visiting a home across the street saw them .
According to the detectives ' report , " the males looked back … and appeared startled . "
" I wish I could have seen the look on their faces , " Rosario told The Seattle Times .
Originally published in France in 2006 , “ Les Bienveillantes ” ( “ The Kindly Ones ” ) won the Prix Goncourt , that country ’s most prestigious literary award , as well as a prize from the Académie Française .
The novel , told from the point of view of an unrepentant Nazi and written in French by the American - born Jonathan Littell , was hailed by the weekly magazine Le Nouvel Observateur as “ a new ‘ War and Peace . ’ ” It became an international best seller and the talk of the Frankfurt Book Fair , and its English - language rights , Publishers Weekly reported , went for “ 1 million - ish ” dollars .
A review in Foreign Policy magazine hailed the book as “ one of the greatest accomplishments of postwar fiction . ”
The novel ’s gushing fans , however , seem to have mistaken perversity for daring , pretension for ambition , an odious stunt for contrarian cleverness .
Willfully sensationalistic and deliberately repellent , “ The Kindly Ones ”  the title is a reference to the Furies , otherwise known in Greek mythology as the Eumenides  is an overstuffed suitcase of a book , consisting of an endless succession of scenes in which Jews are tortured , mutilated , shot , gassed or stuffed in ovens , intercut with an equally endless succession of scenes chronicling the narrator ’s incestuous and sadomasochistic fantasies .
Indeed , the nearly 1,000 - page - long novel reads as if the memoirs of the Auschwitz commandant Rudolf Höss had been rewritten by a bad imitator of Genet and de Sade , or by the warped narrator of Bret Easton Ellis ’s “ American Psycho , ” after repeated viewings of “ The Night Porter ” and “ The Damned . ”
There are pages and pages in which the narrator , Max Aue , tries to rationalize the Nazis ’ anti-Semitism , and pages and pages in which he describes the dead bodies he saw on the Eastern front in Russia , and later , at Auschwitz , where he served as a kind of efficiency expert , worrying about the overloading of the ovens and the basic rule of warehousing : “ first in , first out . ”

well .
i'm pretty sure that SiS put the carbon in right before he installed the 7 " cap , but seems to me that it would be a PITA to change the carbon at a later time , so i drilled a 3 " hole ( with a hole saw ) in the cap before installation .
i was also carefull to leave a 2 " gap between the bottom of the inner core and the bottom of the 7 " cap .
figured it would be pretty easy to fill the filter ( pour and shake , pour and shake , etc. ) later , as well as do carbon changes as needed .
i'm not filling this one now , as it just ain't needed at the present time , but after i do , i'll simply cut a 6 " round disk , and screw it over the hole .
here 's one last pic , looking down thru the filter
that 's it , all done , time to pack a bowl .
if ya'll got any questions , or if i was fuzzy , on anything , feel free to ask away !
good luck , and grow SAFE !
i know what you 're saying , " but RM , how are we gonna get the carbon in there " .

Early last year , I had the enjoyable task of spending several hours in the company of Scarlett Johansson .
I held it together .
I did n't request a photo together , or an autograph ... or even a funny soundbite to use as my voicemail greeting .
That being said , if I ever found myself in a room with Bill Watterson , I would probably start shrieking or sob uncontrollably or wrap the man — scared and bewildered — up in a hug so tight that security would forcibly remove me from the premises .
I have every last Calvin & Hobbes book .
Some date back nearly two decades and were purchased from elementary - school book fairs .
I do n't read them very often , but I will never dump them in the thrift - store pile .
They 're precious to me .
When someone brings this much laughter into your life , this much delight , you show deference .
So I will always keep my books close .
Here are five of the things I love about Mr. Watterson 's famous strip .
***
1. The Expressions
I 'm not just talking about Calvin 's disgusted " blech ! " face when he gets served something healthy and unidentifiable at the dinner table .
I 'm talking about Hobbes 's mile - wide grin when he gets a kiss from Susie Derkins .
I 'm talking about the the sour grimace on the babysitter 's face after enduring a night of Calvin 's hijinx .
Watterson barely needed to provide dialogue .
2. Vocabulary
There 's nothing better than a six - year - old kid who ruminates on life using pentasyllabic words .
Here 's to holding the funnies in one hand and a thesaurus in the other .
Guess that 's what you get when you have a comic strip named after a theologian and a British philosopher .
3. Calvin's Imagination
Sure , there 's the make - believe tiger friend .
But what about the strip with the T - Rex flying the fighter jet ?
Or when Spaceman Spiff landed on some new alien planet that ended up being the mashed potatoes on Calvin 's dinner plate ?
Or when a ratty cardboard box turned into a time machine or a cloning chamber or , best of all , a transmogrifying machine ?
( Trans - mog - ri - fy -ing .
Five syllables .
What 'd I tell you ? )
4. G.R.O.S.S .
Whatever the prepubescent version of sexual tension is , you could cut it with a knife when Susie Derkins came strolling by on her way to a tea party with favorite doll Binky Betsy .
Calvin " Supreme Dictator For Life " and Hobbes up in the treehouse had me rolling on the floor laughing when they convened the Get Rid Of Slimy girlS club .
That incorrigible Ladies ' Tiger , Hobbes , always forgetting the credo .
5. Bill Watterson
Thankyouthankyouthankyou .
I am a sucker for IDEs and I have been meaning to take Netbeans out for a test ride for sometime now .
I have been hearing a lot of good things about Netbeans every since version 6.0 came out and more so ever since the version 6.5 arrived .
OK before I proceed further , let me point out the fact that I have been using Netbeans for C++ development and have never used the IDE for anything other than C ++.
So my comments may be somewhat inaccurate for other languages .
For one the IDE seems to be solidly built and you can find your way around the place easily .
Everything is where it should be and there is no second guessing as to what functionality a particular window , menu item or an option provides .
Clean and sweet .
Netbeans has probably the cleanest interface among IDEs .
This is probably the strongest points about the IDE and given the fact that it is available on multiple platforms , means it could be used by people who do cross platform development .
I ran the IDE on Windows using the MinGW and MSYS systems , and it was n’t very difficult to setup given that I already had MinGW and MSYS setup .
The build system for the IDE is via your native Makefiles ( * shiver * ) .
I severely dislike the taste of Makefiles ; especially maintaining them for large , cross- platform projects that have multiple dependencies .
But the IDE manages Makefile issues nicely and I can live with that .
For those who do n’t already know , Netbeans is actually a framework and a platform to build applications .
The IDE is an application built on top of this platform .
The strength of the Netbeans platform is it ’s ability to have modules .
Platform modules are basically Java classes that interface with Netbeans open API .
The IDE also , can be extended via modules to add and enhance functionality .
An open API like that also means Netbeans can be turned into almost any type of IDE by simply programming in functionality for a language .
The IDE has an excellent code completion feature , and I have to say it is surprisingly fast .
The intellisense of the IDE is top notch , probably better than most free IDEs out there , including my current hot favorite , Code : : Blocks .
I would even go as far as saying that in some situations it is better than even Visual Studio Express .
The Navigator and the class display windows are pretty snappy .
Any addition or change made to the code is updated very very quickly .
On the intellisense front , it deserves a 7 on 10 .
The real - time syntax checker also deserves a praise .
Oh how I miss these things in VS Express 🙁 !!
Small things go a long way in enhancing productivity and Netbeans is by far the best among the free IDEs in that regard .
Netbeans has a lot of modules using which you can extend the functionality of the IDE and the community support is equally good .
I would seriously recommend this IDE to all those who want a free IDE for C ++.
Netbeans by default supports only the GNU toolset , meaning you wo n’t be able to use compilers from Microsoft , Intel , Borland and others .
The debugger used is gdb but the display and setup of the debugging GUI under the IDE can probably rival any other IDE for completeness .
So what ’s to complain ?
Nothing really ; but , just to nitpick , the fonts look a bit messy .
There is no hinting on the fonts and it does look a bit drab .
No hinting also means I have to use a higher font size than I normally do under VS and Code : : Blocks .
Talking about Code : : Blocks , for me C : : B still edges out in front of Netbeans just because it has a build - in GUI designer for wxWidgets , and well Netbeans dose n’t but that is probably just for me .
I hope someone writes one soon 😀 .
Netbeans is too good an IDE to ignore .
However , I must say , I am impressed with Netbeans .
It sure seems OSS IDEs are rapidly closing the gap between commercial ones .

Advertisement Huge crowds have taken to the streets in France to protest over the handling of the economic crisis , causing disruption to rail and air services .
Unions said 2.5 m workers had rallied to demand action to protect wages and jobs .
Police put the total at 1 m .
President Nicolas Sarkozy said concerns over the crisis were legitimate and the government had to listen and act .
He will meet union and business leaders next month to discuss what programme of reforms to follow this year , he said .
Overall , the government estimated that a quarter of the country 's public sector workers had joined the action , which was called by eight major French unions .
The unions put the figure higher .
A spokesman for the CGT union told AFP that 2.5 m people across the country had taken part in the day 's protests .
French police put the number at just over 1m .
In pictures : French strike Economic woes at heart of strike France takes strike in its stride CGT leader Bernard Thibault called on Mr Sarkozy to recognise the gravity of the situation and " reassess his measures " to deal with the economic crisis .
In Paris , police said some 65,000 demonstrators had joined a march from the Place de la Bastille towards the centre of the city .
There were reports of violent outbreaks on the outskirts of the protest as it reached central Paris , with dozens of youths throwing bottles and lighting fires in a main shopping street .
Police in riot gear charged the youths , pushing them back on to the Place de l'Opera where the crowds were gathering , but the situation remained volatile .
There were repeated baton charges , and after fires were lit on some of Paris ' best - known boulevards , police used tear gas on the minority of protesters who were violent .
Earlier , some 25,000 to 30,000 people rallied in the city of Lyon , according to organisers and police .
In Marseille , organisers and the authorities disagreed , with the former putting the number of demonstrators at 300,000 but the police estimating 24,000 had taken part .
The protests are against the worsening economic climate in France and at what people believe to be the government 's poor handling of the crisis .
Opposition Socialist Party leader Martine Aubry said people were out in the streets " to express what worries them : the fact that they work and yet cannot make ends meet , retired people who just can't make it [ financially ] , the fear of redundancies , and a president of the Republic and a government that just do n't want to change policy " .
Staying home
The strike action disrupted transport services but did not cause the paralysis forecast by unions .
Regional trains and those in and around Paris were hit , and a third of flights from Orly airport were cancelled .
Striking is ... the national sport , a selfish and narrow - minded way of dealing with just about any disagreement
Brigitte Cavanagh , Paris
French strikes :
Your views
Forty per cent of regional services were running , train operator SNCF said , and 60 % of high - speed TGV services .
Three - quarters of metro trains were running in Paris .
Paris 's second airport was heavily hit by the strike , but flights out of the larger Charles de Gaulle hub were experiencing only short delays , AFP news agency said .
Schools , banks , hospitals , post offices and courts were also hit as workers stayed at home .
Officials said just over a third of teachers and a quarter of postal and power company workers were on strike .
According to a 25 January poll by CSA - Opinion for Le Parisien , 69 % of the French public backs the strike .
" I 'm tired and frozen after waiting half - an - hour on the platform , " commuter Sandrine Dermont told AFP as she arrived by train in Paris .
" But I 'm prepared to accept that when it 's a movement to defend our spending power and jobs .
I 'll join the street protests during my lunch break , " she said .
Hit hard Many people are furious that Mr Sarkozy said there was no money left to raise wages and consumer spending power , but nonetheless managed to find billions of euros to bail out floundering French banks , says the BBC's Emma -Jane Kirby in Paris .
The walk - out has affected transport , education and postal services throughout the country , our correspondent says , and is the biggest one - day strike since Mr Sarkozy took up office .

With unemployment looking likely to reach 10 % next year , she says , the protesters hope he will drop his programme of cost - cutting reforms and focus instead on protecting workers ' jobs and wages .
Mr Sarkozy cannot ignore this demonstration of anger , our correspondent adds .
Street protests have repeatedly brought down French leaders and Mr Sarkozy does not want his government added to that list of casualties .
" We want to show how the people are dissatisfied with the situation at the moment , " Thierry Dedieu of the CFDT general workers ' union told the BBC .
People had the feeling they were paying for a crisis they were not responsible for , he added .
But earlier in the week , French Finance Minister Eric Woerth condemned the strike organisers , accusing them of scare - mongering during a time of economic uncertainty .

SANTA ROSA , Calif . —
In a “ Peanuts ” strip from the mid-1950s , Charlie Brown walks through the first panel and finds Schroeder sitting in front of an adult - size hi- fi , his ear to the speaker .
“ Shh , ” Schroeder says , “ I ’m listening to Beethoven ’s Ninth . ” Charlie Brown inspects Schroeder ’s outfit .
“ In an overcoat ? ” he asks .
Schroeder leans even closer to the speaker and responds , “ The first movement was so beautiful it gave me the chills ! ”
In the world of “ Peanuts , ” of course , Schroeder was the Beethoven - obsessed music nerd who lost patience when Lucy interrupted his practice and who called time - outs as a baseball catcher to share composer trivia with the pitcher .
Yet musicologists and art curators have learned that there was much more than a punch line to Charles Schulz ’s invocation of Beethoven ’s music .
“ If you do n’t read music and you ca n’t identify the music in the strips , then you lose out on some of the meaning , ” said William Meredith , the director of the Ira F. Brilliant Center for Beethoven Studies at San Jose State University , who has studied hundreds of Beethoven - themed “ Peanuts ” strips .
When Schroeder pounded on his piano , his eyes clenched in a trance , the notes floating above his head were no random ink spots dropped into the key of G. Schulz carefully chose each snatch of music he drew and transcribed the notes from the score .
More than an illustration , the music was a soundtrack to the strip , introducing the characters ’ state of emotion , prompting one of them to ask a question or punctuating an interaction .

Newswise —
The Bureau of Labor Statistics just announced a jump in the jobless rate , from 6.8 percent in November to 7.2 percent in December .
This indicates that there is further growth in the ranks of the uninsured .
As many as half a million people may lose their health coverage as a result of last month 's job losses .
A new report by The George Washington University School of Public Health and Health Services ( GW / SPHHS ) spells out the potential health consequences of this , and other aspects of the recession .
It also reviews proposals that are part of federal efforts to stimulate an economic recovery , and that would help to reduce impoverishment , strengthen access to health care , and protect the health of more Americans .
The links between income and health are clear " higher - income people live longer , with less disease and disability , than lower - income people .
Research also shows that :
" ¢
In recent months a rising number of Americans have failed to obtain medical care because of its cost , cut back on preventive care , and skimped on their medication . " ¢
For every one percent rise in joblessness more than one million people join the ranks of the uninsured .
People who are uninsured receive poorer medical care , are less likely to get recommended screenings and other prevention services , and are more likely to delay physician visits , neglect chronic conditions , and incur medical debt .
" ¢
When joblessness jumps by one percent , states add about one million more people to the rolls of Medicaid and the State Children 's Insurance Program ( SCHIP ) , putting increased pressure on their already tight budgets .
Many states are cutting their Medicaid programs despite evidence that it is an economic , efficient , and resilient form of health insurance coverage .
" ¢ Families are being forced to choose among competing demands for food , home energy , and health care .
Families that are " food insecure " or " energy insecure " are more likely to have children in poorer health .
The most effective economic recovery package will increase protections to vulnerable families and put money into the hands of people most likely to spend it quickly .
Policymakers are considering :
" ¢ Increasing federal contributions to state Medicaid programs to assure that states maintain their eligibility levels .
" ¢ Expanding SCHIP to reach more children .
" ¢ Increasing benefits through the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program ( formerly called the Food Stamp Program ) .
This program serves as the link between food insecurity and health and is an important engine of economic growth .
" ¢ Expanding home energy assistance .
The federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program reaches only about 16 percent of eligible families , despite its demonstrated benefits to child health .
" ¢ Extending unemployment insurance .
The incoming Director of the Office of Management and Budget calls unemployment insurance one of the most effective economic stabilizers available to counter economic weakness .
" ¢ Providing health insurance temporarily for recently laid - off workers and their families .
One approach is to underwrite the costs of COBRA health insurance coverage , which is currently available to people who have lost their jobs only if they were previously covered and can afford the premiums .
Another strategy is to widen Medicaid coverage to those who are not currently poor enough to qualify , but still can not afford health insurance on their own .
Targeting individuals and families suffering from the consequences of the downturn , and helping to stabilize and revitalize their communities may begin to reverse the health consequences of the recession .

A week ago I started going through my blog ’s logs , and realized that I ’d had a jump in visits from Google .
Digging a little bit deeper into it , I realized that a lot of people seem to be searching for “ working at canonical ” phrased in different ways .
From what I can gather , it ’s split up into two groups : people who want to find a job in Canonical , and people who are considering a specific role and want to know what it ’s like .
So , I thought it would be useful to provide information for the dozen of people who land here every day 🙂
If you want to work for Canonical , check out the employment page , it always has the latest job offers : http://webapps.ubuntu.com/employment/
Among many other things , my team is currently looking for awesome people to join the User Experience Team , the coolest place to be today 😉
As for what it ’s like to work at Canonical , here ’s my take on it :
At this point , it ’s been a little over five months since I started working full time , although I was doing some contracting work before that , and I ’ve been around the Ubuntu and bzr community for ages , so I already knew a lot of the people before joining .
One of the coolest things for me is that the way most of the company works , is basically the same as your typical open source project : mailing lists , irc , distributed , and filled with passionate people .
If you have an open source background , the transition should be pretty seamless .
Coming from other companies may take a little bit of getting used , but you know how it is , “ your mileage may vary “ .
The Ubuntu - like atmosphere where everybody is extremely nice and respectful seems to span across the whole company as well .
This was especially surprising to me considering that everyone is astonishingly smart , and have done amazing things I had read ( and still do ! ) on news sites for years .
My experience is that when too many smart people are together , it ’s a much more cut - throat competitive environment .
Here , it is not .
You could sit down and have a fantastic and interesting dinner with anyone in the company ( I ’ve shared meals with dozens of different people , and it ’s held up true every single time ) .
On the technical side , all the teams are constantly revising and improving work flows and tools , pushing towards the cutting edge by adopting all kinds of lean and agile development strategies , while still being very much test - driven .
What can be more appealing to a developer than that ?
Finally , there are so many interesting projects being worked on at the same time , it ’s often very hard to keep up with what ’s happening .
Personally , I believe that the balance between open source development and projects developed in - house as services or for third parties , plays a very big part in making everything happen so fast a two - hundred - and - something people size the company .
It ’s amazing how so many people are payed to work full time on directly on free software , directly interleaved with the community .

Racine -
By the time Mayor Gary Becker engaged in a 2 1/ 2 - hour online chat Monday night with " Hope_Ulikeme14 , " he already had participated in several salacious virtual conversations with girls and collected child pornography , according to a five - felony criminal complaint filed against him Thursday .
Even so , Becker , 51 , a married father of two daughters , worried about meeting someone who he believed was a 14 - year - old girl .
" We better chat more , this is too dangerous , " Becker told an undercover agent on the phone Tuesday afternoon , the complaint says .
He even asked " Hope " if she was a " cop . "
But about an hour later , Becker , seemingly well - positioned to continue his six - year tenure as mayor for years to come , arrived at the agreed - upon meeting place : the food court at Brookfield Square mall , the complaint says .
After an agent of the state Division of Criminal Investigation showed him a transcript of Monday 's chat , Becker admitted to being the " m reed " who participated in the conversation and was arrested , according to the complaint .
The five felonies plus a misdemeanor - believed to be the first charges filed by the division 's 10 - year - old Internet Crimes Task Force against an elected official - include attempted sexual assault of a child , child enticement and possession of child pornography .
The most serious count carries a maximum penalty of 40 years in prison , although some defendants convicted in Internet stings have been sentenced to probation and short terms in jail .
Becker , wearing a City of Racine coat , made no statement during a brief initial appearance Thursday in Racine County Circuit Court .
Free on bail , he is expected to enter pleas to the charges , filed by Republican Racine County District Attorney Michael Nieskes , on Feb. 10 .
Becker has not been removed from office - an alderman is serving as acting mayor - but his political future appears in jeopardy .
Gerald Greenfield , former chairman of the Racine County Democratic Party , said Becker succeeded in the non-partisan office of mayor because , while an ardent Democrat , he could work well with political opponents such as Republican members of the state Legislature .
" It 's just tragic for the whole family to live with from now on , " Greenfield said .
According to the criminal complaint :
On Dec. 23 , Becker brought a personal computer to City Hall and asked a city computer technician to fix a problem with it .
The technician found what appeared to be images of child pornography and alerted Racine police .
Racine police referred the case to the state Internet crimes task force , which later learned that Becker had also asked a city technician to fix another computer of his in August 2007 .
That computer also contained pornographic images .
The state investigators also found more than 1,800 online chat sessions , in which people exchange written messages using computers .
Some of the conversations included communications with underage females " for the purpose of sexual activity . "
Becker described himself online as a Wisconsin man whose interests included " seducing all age females into being hot sluts . "
The investigator posing as the 14 - year - old girl who engaged in an online chat with Becker on Monday also sent Becker a photograph of a former intern from the office of the Division of Criminal Investigation from when she was about 14 .
Becker expressed a desire to have sexual activity , including oral sex , with who he believed was the girl .
Becker also agreed to meet at the mall , saying from his home in the chat , " It will be hard to keep my hands off u in public " and " I would luv to get a hotel room and have lots of fun with u . "
After his arrest , Becker spent Tuesday night in jail .
He was released Wednesday night after a family member posted $ 165,000 bail .
Becker and his lawyer , Pat Cafferty of Racine , refused to comment after the court hearing on whether Becker would resign from his mayoral job .
INFLUENTIAL Harvard University politics professor Samuel Huntington , who died on Christmas Eve , is best known for his theory that the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War meant future international conflict would no longer be between competing superpowers or economic ideologies but between groups of nations belonging to one of eight civilisations based loosely on culture and religion .
The principle clash would involve three civilisations  Western ( the US and Europe ) , Confucian ( based around China ) and Islamic .
Huntington 's thesis appeared in a journal in 1993 .
Since the terrorism attacks of September 11 , 2001 , the theory has been co-opted by extremists seeking to impose their violent sectarian prejudices on the rest of us .
The intricacies and nuances of his theory have been replaced by incoherent rants .
Tabloid columnists from New York to Sydney cite Huntington in support of the ridiculous notion that Europe will necessarily become " Eurabia " .
Their equivalents in Karachi and Jakarta impose Osama bin Laden 's logic on Huntington when writing about the existence of a " grand crusader and Jewish conspiracy against Islam " .
Huntington 's original voice has become the distorted echo of cultural jihad .
The reality is much more complex .
It is impossible to divide people into neat categories of " Muslim " or " Western " or " Sinic " ( Chinese ) .
When visiting a mosque , I 'm happy to join my brothers  and , in some Australian cases , sisters  praying towards Mecca .
But I would rather learn my theology from American imams at the Zaytuna Institute in California than from the Saudi religious establishment .
I also understand that not everyone who listens to the same music I have on my iPod necessarily supports Western hegemony .
Box2D is responsible for inspiring many 2d physics engines including Motor2 , Box2DFlashAS3 and others .
Box2D the original toolkit is a solid c++ physics engine that has many great examples and features including real collision .
Now it has inspired a pure Javascript version of Box2D called Box2 Djs to ( using prototype dependency ) to implement many of the same demos using the same functionality .
So it appears Box2D if you want to find a baseline standard physics kit for 2D , it now has versions in many languages that might allow you to have 2d physics capabilities across many platforms .
Box2DJS is a JavaScript port of Box2D Physics Engine .
To tell the truth , this is converted from Box2DFlashAS3_1.4.3.1 in an automatic manner .
( The reason why not Box2DFlash AS3_2.0.0 based is simply because I overlooked the renewal . )
Dependencies

How to use
Download a zip file and extract it .
Copy js / and lib / directories from the extracted directory to your app directory .
Copy script tags in the header part of index.html in the extacted directory to your html file where you want to simulate physics .
Because this library does not have a lazy - loading system now , you should load all classes before starting your simulation .
To make things worse , each library has a bit complicated dependency each other so that loading libraries in wrong order may cause a fatal error .
To avoid such a trouble , it is strongly recommended to copy the header part of this file or `index .

The man who tried unsuccessfully for almost a decade to spur federal securities regulators to investigate Bernard L. Madoff did not initially disclose his own identity to regulators because he feared for his life , according to testimony he has apparently prepared for a Congressional hearing Wednesday morning .
The witness , Harry Markopolos , will testify that Mr. Madoff “ was one of the most powerful men on Wall Street and in a position to easily end our careers or worse , ” and that his fund “ posed great danger ” to those who investigated it , based on a version of his remarks that emerged Tuesday evening .
While the testimony , posted on the Fox Business and Wall Street Journal Web sites , mirrors statements he has made on his own site and elsewhere , neither he nor his lawyers could be reached to confirm its authenticity .
Mr. Markopolos , an independent investigator who works for institutional investors , is to be questioned about his frustrated dealings with regulators by members of a House Financial Services subcommittee led by Paul E. Kanjorski , Democrat of Pennsylvania .

Researchers at MIT recently found an elegant solution to a sticky scientific problem in basic fluid mechanics : why water does n't soak into soil at an even rate , but instead forms what look like fingers of fluid flowing downward .
Scientists call these rivulets " gravity fingers , " and the explanation for their formation has to do with the surface tension where the water — or any liquid — meets the soil ( or other medium ) .
Knowing how to account for this phenomenon mathematically will have wide - ranging impact on science problems and engineering applications , including the recovery of oil from reservoirs and the sequestration of carbon underground .
The solution reported in the Dec. 12 issue of Physical Review Letters involves borrowing a mathematical phrase , if you will , from the mathematical description of a similar problem , a solution both simple and elegant that had escaped the notice of many researchers in earlier attempts to describe the phenomenon .
Gravity - driven fingers - ponded infiltrationCo-authors Luis Cueto - Felgueroso and Ruben Juanes of the MIT Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering discovered the solution while studying the larger question of how water displaces oil in underground reservoirs .
( Petroleum engineers commonly flush oil reservoirs with water to enhance oil recovery . )
" Our paper addresses a long - standing issue in soil physics , " said Cueto - Felgueroso .
" Lab experiments of water infiltration into homogeneous , dry soil , repeatedly show the presence of preferential flow in the form of fingers .
Yet , after several decades , the scientific community has been unable to capture this phenomenon using mathematical models . " " This was the type of problem that required someone from a different research discipline to take a look at it and come up with the solution , " said Juanes , the ARCO Assistant Professor in Energy Studies .
" Luis applied his expertise to a fluid mechanics problem in another medium — porous media flows — and quickly figured out the solution .
" Cueto - Felgueroso , a post - doctoral associate who has previously worked primarily on airflow fluid mechanics problems , had a Eureka !
moment when he realized that gravity fingers in soil ( or clay or sand ) look very similar to water flowing down a window pane , a fairly well - understood phenomenon .
He and Juanes then pulled the mathematical explanation ( think of it as a phrase of words or music ) from the equation describing water on a window , and included that mathematical phrase in the equation describing liquid moving downward through soil .
After rigorous comparison of data produced by the new mathematical model with observed phenomena , the two realized they 'd found the solution , a solution described by one scientist reviewing the paper in Physical Review Letters as " simple and elegant " and a " major breakthrough " in the field .
The Cueto - Felgueroso and Juanes solution also describes one aspect of the water - flowing - down - a - windowpane phenomenon that previously was not understood by scientists , who actually refer to this as " the flow of thin films " : why water builds up at the tips of the fingers .
Again , the answer has to with the surface tension .
Before the water can flow down the film , it must build up enough energy to overcome the tension holding it in place .
So what was missing from earlier models of water moving downward through soil that made it appear to move as a steady , horizontal front , rather than in finger - like paths — even when the soil was homogenous in particle size and shape ?
The missing mathematical phrase describes the surface tension of the entire finger of water , which may be several centimeters in width , as opposed to the tension existing at the micron - scale of pores between soil particles .
And that phrase will sound like music to the ears of physicists and engineers .
First the frogs started disappearing .
Then the bees started disappearing .
Now , according to the Seattle Times , its birds :
Pelicans suffering from a mysterious malady are crashing into cars and boats , wandering along roadways and turning up dead by the hundreds across the West Coast , from southern Oregon to Baja California , Mexico , bird - rescue workers say .
Frogs and bees are so different from people that they are easier to ignore .
But birds are larger , more complicated , warm - blooded animals , and thus closer to us biologically .
People will be in
real trouble unless we figure out why the amphibians , bees and birds are dying .

Winter turned fierce in the opening weeks of 2009 .
A bitter cold snap set in over much of the United States , and temperatures plummeted beyond - 30 degrees Celsius ( - 22 F ) in parts of the Upper Midwest .
On February 2 , portions of Western Europe were doused with heavy snow .
England received the brunt of the storm with up to 20 centimeters ( 8 inches ) of snow falling in London .
It was the heaviest snowfall southeastern England had seen in nearly 20 years , reported BBC News .
So why all the nasty weather ?
Part of the answer lies in the stratosphere , some 20 kilometers ( 12 miles ) above the Earth ’s surface .
Starting in January and extending into early February 2009 , wind and temperature patterns in the stratosphere changed dramatically .
In just a few weeks , temperatures climbed by about 50 degrees Celsius ( 90 degrees F ) on average , with larger spikes in places , and winds flipped direction , changing by nearly 100 meters per second ( 200 miles per hour ) .
That change influenced weather patterns lower in the atmosphere .
These images and the associated animation show how the stratosphere changed and help illustrate why the United States and Europe were in the grip of such odd weather .
The globes show temperatures ( top ) and vorticity ( bottom ) on January 10 ( left ) and February 2 ( right ) .
( The animation runs from January 10 - February 4 . )
The images are based on assimilated weather observations of the atmosphere from the Goddard Modeling and Assimilation Office at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center .
In the winter , little to no sunlight reaches Earth ’s northern extremes .
Deprived of energy , the stratosphere over the Arctic grows cold .
These were the conditions present on January 10 , 2009 , as shown in the top left image .
The cold air mass creates a low - pressure system in the stratosphere that sits over the Arctic throughout the winter .
Farther south , where the Sun is shining , the air is warmer and air pressure is higher in the stratosphere .
Air flows away from the high - pressure system towards the low - pressure system .
Because the Earth is turning , the air is deflected to the right as it moves north , creating a strong counterclockwise ( west to east ) current of wind , which scientists call the polar night jet .
The lower pair of images represent the air mass , or polar vortex , that controls the wind pattern .
Essentially , the winds are strongest at the edge of the polar vortex ( where the pressure difference between the air masses is greatest ) .
The area of red in the lower left image represents polar air that typically sits over the Arctic during January .
In general , strong winds circle the red regions , or areas of high vorticity , in a counterclockwise direction .
These winds , moving at speeds well above 100 miles per hour , influence winds and weather patterns closer to Earth ’s surface .
Their influence means that weather in England and Western Europe typically comes from the west .
Over England , western winds blow in ocean air warmed by the Atlantic Gulf Stream .
The big change in the Arctic came when the polar vortex ripped apart .
A developing weather system in the lower atmosphere traveled upward into the stratosphere .
The disturbance nudged into the center of the Arctic air mass , elongating it and eventually splitting it like a cell in mitosis .
By February 2 , two air masses existed , each with a jet of wind circling it counterclockwise as depicted in the lower right image .
Warm air filled the gap between the two colder air masses , and temperatures high over the North Pole climbed , as shown in the upper right .
Now the colder air had shifted farther south over Canada and Siberia .
Over North America , this piece of the stratospheric polar vortex had a deep reach into the lower atmosphere ( troposphere ) , which created strong winds from the north that carried cold Arctic air far south into the United States .
In Europe , the split in the air mass actually changed the direction of winds in the lower atmosphere .
The second piece of the polar vortex was centered east of Western Europe , as shown in the lower left image , and it too was surrounded by a jet of strong wind moving counterclockwise .
Like the segment of the polar vortex over North America , this piece of the polar vortex also had a deep reach into the lower atmosphere .
It caused cold continental air to blow in from the east , replacing the warmer air that typically blows in from the west .
As the frigid air moved over the North Sea , it picked up moisture , which fell over the United Kingdom and parts of France as heavy snow .

The Middle East has always been a difficult challenge for Western human rights organizations , particularly those seeking influence or funding in the United States .
The pressure to go soft on US allies is in some respects reminiscent of Washington ’s special pleading for Latin American terror regimes in the 1970s and 1980s .
In the case of Israel such organizations also face a powerful and influential domestic constituency , which often extends to senior echelons of such organizations , for whom forthright condemnation of Israel is anathema .
Given that Israel is reliant on US subventions and public goodwill to a degree without precedent in the history of American foreign policy , there is considerably more than vanity at stake .
If Israel ’s stature in the United States were to be reduced to that of South Africa during the apartheid era , or Serbia during the Balkan wars , this would almost certainly have material consequences for the “ special relationship ” .
It is a reality very unlike that between the US and Saudi Arabia , for example , in which the American public ’s longstanding contempt for the House of Saud has proven basically inconsequential .
In Israel ’s case , image is a political resource of the first order , and its preservation a matter of national security .
Until the mid-1980s , before which Israel ’s human rights violations — from deportation to area bombing and all in - between — were generally several orders of magnitude worse than during the subsequent quarter century , the human rights community simply ignored the question of Israel .
If challenged , organizations would respond that in view of limited resources they had to go after serious violators , like Ba’thist Iraq and Iran under the Shah , or hide behind an Israeli judiciary that although essential to the machinery of occupation at least went through the motions of oversight , or express fears of being tarred with the brush of anti-Semitism ( or all of the above ) .
In private , such justifications would be augmented by references to political pressures and funding issues , often with a barb at one or more director or board members ’
Zionist sympathies thrown in .
That the first widespread exposure of the systematic application of torture in Israel ’s prison system was reported by the Sunday Times rather than Amnesty International was no mere coincidence .
The eruption of the Palestinian uprising in December 1987 made it impossible for human rights organizations to continue relegating the question of Israel to the backburner .
With Israeli leaders like Yitzhak Rabin publicly exhorting Israel ’s soldiers to “ break the bones ” of unarmed Palestinian protestors , and television images that made it impossible to explain away such barbarism as a mistranslated rhetorical flourish , human rights organizations faced a real quandary : ignore the question of Israel and lose credibility , or confront it and lose support .
By and large they chose a third way , producing reports that were often strong on documentation but exceptionally weak when it came to conclusions and consequences .
No less importantly , they adopted the criteria of ‘ balance ’ .
In effect , a Hubble telescope was deployed to discover Palestinian actions that could in any way be considered violations of International Humanitarian Law , with these subsequently placed under an industrial - strength microscope .
Treatment of Israeli actions was rather more selective and careful .
Primary issues such as the legality of Israel ’s presence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip , or its settlement enterprise in the occupied territories were avoided ; detailed analysis of Israeli abuses , like deportation and summary executions , that indisputably constituted “ grave breaches ” of the Fourth Geneva Convention ( the latter ’s equivalent of war crimes ) steered clear of unambiguous conclusions ; and on the key issue of how to resolve the human rights emergency , such reports typically ended with exhortations to the Israeli government and military to show greater concern for Palestinian rights — as opposed to demands that Western governments use their various forms of aid to Israel as leverage to halt abuses .
In the process any sense of context , of this being a struggle for freedom by a dispossessed and occupied people against a colonial army — a context that in other cases the human rights community communicated so well — was entirely lost .
All the more so because Israel was systematically spared the type of rhetoric and denunciations typically deployed with respect to similar situations in other continents and domestic repression in Arab states .
If it was an approach that left neither the victims nor apologists of Israeli human rights violations satisfied , it at least met their minimal requirements — unprecedented exposure for the Palestinians , continued impunity for Israel .
More importantly , it enabled the human rights organizations in question to navigate the storm and emerge relatively unscathed .
The Oslo agreements of 1993 provided a welcome development in this respect .
Henceforth , ‘ balance ’ could be maintained by releasing reports on both the Israeli and Palestinian Authority judiciary , discrimination against Arabs in Israel and of violence against women in the occupied territories , torture in Israeli as well as Palestinian prisons .
The idea of an overarching regime of occupation primarily responsible for both sets of violations — a concept that came so naturally when discussing the brutalities inflicted on the residents of South Africa ’s ethnic homelands — rarely entered into the fray .
The onset of the Al - Aqsa Uprising in September 2000 posed a new set of challenges .
Israel ’s image was once again under unprecedented pressure on account of its savage attacks on Palestinians throughout the occupied territories , while committed staff on the ground — motivated by a combination of genuine concern and professional honour — exercised significant pressure on human rights organizations to step up to the plate .
At the same time , particularly after 11 September 2001 , such organizations were under massive pressure by right - wing and pro-Israeli forces — the latter of whom often tended towards the liberal end of the spectrum — to toe the line .
Nowhere was this more true than at Human Rights Watch , an American organization that by the late 1990s had emerged as the industry leader .
In the years since 2000 , HRW pursued a consistent — and consistently effective — formula : criticize Israel , but condemn the Palestinians .
Challenge the legality of an Israeli aerial bombardment , preferably in polite , technical terms , and vociferously denounce the Palestinian suicide bomber in unambiguous language — especially when raising questions about the latest Israeli atrocity .
In HRW publications , explicit condemnations and accusations of war crimes were almost wholly monopolized by Palestinians .
With Israeli citizenship a seeming precondition for the right to self - defense , the right to resist was for all intents and purposes non-existent .
Where — as with the obliteration of a good portion of the Jenin Refugee Camp in 2002 — accusations of Israeli war crimes could not be avoided , HRW diluted these by just as prominently reporting that it did not find evidence of much worse atrocities .
Its major report on the issue , Jenin : IDF Military Operations , was several months later ‘ balanced ’ by Erased in a Moment : Suicide Bombing Attacks Against Israeli Civilians .
One need only compare the titles of these two reports to surmise which party to the conflict stands accused of perpetrating “ atrocities ” that HRW “ unreservedly condemns ” , “ war crimes ” , and indeed “ crimes against humanity ” ; in which of the two cases HRW repeatedly demands that all those with command or operational responsibility — and they are many indeed — face “ criminal liability ” ; whose national leader must , despite HRW ’s finding no evidence of command responsibility , face “ accountability ” for not preventing the acts of others , as well as for “ significant political responsibility for the deliberate killing of civilians ” ; and whose actions HRW concludes “ are among the worst crimes that can be committed , crimes of universal jurisdiction that the international community as a whole has an obligation to punish and prevent ” .
A comparison of the two reports ’ covers might also help readers judge whether it was Israel or the Palestinians who are merely referred for further examination : “ Every case in the report listed below warrants additional thorough , transparent , and impartial investigation , with the results of such an investigation made public .
Where wrongdoing is found , those responsible should be held accountable ” .
Needless to say the press release accompanying Erased in a Moment did not , as in the case of the Jenin report , use the opening paragraph to shift discussion to more sensational allegations for which no evidence could be found — such as “ HRW researchers were unable to substantiate published claims by prominent advocates of Israel that Palestinian suicide bombers have been lacing their explosives with AIDS , hepatitis and rat poison ” .
Its summary did however delve extensively — in fact primarily — on the person of Yasir Arafat , even though most suicide bombings were carried out by rival organizations and HRW concluded he was not involved in attacks carried out by his Fatah organization .
It was presumably a simple coincidence that HRW ’s highly critical account of the late Palestinian leader — occupying significantly more space in the report summary than Hamas and Islamic Jihad combined — was published at the height of the Bush administration ’s campaign for Palestinian regime change .
Moving forward , and in an incident that might otherwise be considered comic , HRW in November 2006 went so far as to denounce Palestinians who refused to vacate homes threatened with imminent aerial bombardment , rather than the state bent on obliterating their houses , as war criminals .
By the time it retracted its claims in a rare recantation — the howls of outrage from less partisan lawyers and human rights professionals were simply too loud to be ignored — the damage had already been done .
Interestingly , Palestinians were denounced by HRW on the legally correct ( but in this case factually inaccurate ) assumption that “ It is a war crime to seek to use the presence of civilians to render certain points or areas immune from military operations or to direct the movement of the civilian population or individual civilians in order to attempt to shield military objectives from attack ” .
Yet HRW ’s 2002 report , In a Dark Hour : The Use of Civilians During IDF Arrest Operations , which according to the accompanying press release “ documents how the IDF routinely has taken civilians at gunpoint to open suspicious packages , knock on doors of suspects , and search the houses of ‘ wanted ’ Palestinians during its military operations ” , pointedly declines to define human shielding as a war crime .
Indeed , the only differences between the documented 2002 cases and falsely alleged 2006 incidents are that the former were conducted by Israel and reached the level of systematic practice .
In 2006 HRW additionally leveled war crimes charges against Palestinian militants who captured Gilad Shalit — a uniformed soldier on active duty — on the grounds that they intended to exchange him for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel .
Consequently , the main and clearest finding of “ Gaza : Israeli Offensive Must Limit Harm to Civilians ” ( 28 June 2006 ) , is that “ A hostage is a person held in the power of an adversary in order to obtain specific actions , such as the release of prisoners , from the other party to the conflict . . . which is a war crime under the laws of war ” .
Against this apparently unprecedented act in the annals of military history , Israel ’s own actions , which included the mass arrest of Palestinian parliamentarians and in some respects resembled a test run for Israel ’s latest onslaught on the Gaza Strip ( and which were the alleged subject of the press release ) , elicited only legal exegesis , shorn of meaningful conclusions .
More recently , the organization has issued a fatwa that any Arab launching a projectile at an Israeli target is by definition a war criminal , because such rockets and mortars are — unlike the state - of - the - art shells and missiles fired by Israel at apartment blocks , schools , hospitals , and UN facilities — not precision - guided and therefore according to HRW incapable of distinguishing between a military and civilian target .
Such gunners can also not hide behind the excuse that they hit an empty field or even that they successfully aimed at and struck a legitimate military target ; for HRW it is the act of using yesterday ’s weapon rather than its impact that defines the crime .
( There is , parenthetically , no record of HRW condemning Israel or the US of committing war crimes by virtue of using unguided projectiles ) .
Asked about this rather bizarre state of affairs , every current and former HRW staff member spoken to over many years — most of them in rather senior positions — point at least two fingers at HRW director Kenneth Roth ’s affinity for Israel .
At least as important , apparently , is Roth ’s exceptional ability to divine the political wind , and do whatever is necessary to ensure that HRW retains the resources and credentials to remain the industry leader .
It is that rare case where principle and opportunism merge rather than collide .
( While Roth undoubtedly has allies on the organisation ’s board and among its staff for his approach to the question of Israel , these are easily outnumbered by critics who would like to see a more uniform standard applied by their organisation ) .
Thus , in a 2006 missive to then - Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on the eve of her Mideast sojourn at the height of Israel ’s US - sponsored onslaught on Lebanon Roth , in perhaps the outstanding act of political courage during the Bush years , insisted on drawing her attention to the war crimes being perpetrated in the conflict – by Hizballah .
According to several senior HRW employees , Roth subsequently tried to arrange for a critic who questioned HRW ’s partisanship to be fired by filing a written complaint to the critic ’s director .
As a case study of HRW ’s response to the question of Israel , its publications during the recent Israeli onslaught on the Gaza Strip — all of which were consulted on www.hrw.org on 25 January 2009 — only confirm the pattern discussed above , and in some respects go beyond it as well .
True to form , HRW ’s first pronouncement on the conflict , issued on 30 December 2008 and entitled “ Israel : Artillery Poses Risk to Gaza Civilians ” , despite its brevity meticulously documents relevant Israeli practice and the cost it has exacted in Palestinian life and limb .
That said , there is no condemnation to be found .
“ In assessing the legality of the IDF ’s artillery fire under international humanitarian law , or the laws of war ” , it politely concludes , “ it is necessary to determine for each attack whether it was targeted at a specific military objective ; whether the weapon used could be aimed with sufficient accuracy to differentiate between the military objective and civilians ; and whether the anticipated civilian casualties were not disproportionate to the expected military gain from the attack ” .
Turning next to a subject entirely unrelated to the publication ’s title — namely Palestinian rocket attacks — the arcane technical analysis suddenly comes to a screeching halt .
Rather than ‘ if on the one hand , but then on the other ’ , we read the following : “ Human Rights Watch has repeatedly condemned the launching of rockets at population centers in Israel by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups .
The rockets are highly inaccurate , and those launching them cannot accurately target military objects .
Deliberately firing indiscriminate weapons into civilian - populated areas , as a matter of policy , constitutes a war crime ” .
For good measure HRW that same day released “ Israel / Hamas : Civilians Must Not be Targets ” .
On the one hand , “ Human Rights Watch investigated three Israeli attacks that raise particular concern about Israel ’s targeting decisions and require independent and impartial inquiries to determine whether the attacks violated the laws of war .
In three incidents detailed below , 18 civilians died , among them at least seven children ” .
Indeed , “ Some other Israeli targets may have also been unlawful under the laws of war ” .
Yet , on the other hand , “ Human Rights Watch has long criticized Palestinian rocket attacks against Israeli civilians — most recently , in a public letter to Hamas on November 20 .
The rockets are highly inaccurate , and those launching them cannot accurately target military objects .
Deliberately firing indiscriminate weapons into civilian populated areas , as a matter of policy , constitutes a war crime ” .
Nevertheless by the following day , in the lengthy “ Q&A on Hostilities between Israel and Hamas ” Hamas leaders were no longer being led to a war crimes tribunal in HRW chains .
Confronted with evidence too overwhelming to ignore that Israel was deliberately firing much greater quantities of precision - guided weapons not only into civilian - populated areas , but directly at the civilian population and to much greater effect , HRW was confronted with a stark choice : accuse Israel of war crimes , or change Hamas ’s rap sheet .
It prudently opted for the latter , accusing Israel only of “ indiscriminate attacks in violation of the laws of war ” .
For the rest of the conflict , Hamas was able to “ deliberately fire indiscriminate weapons into civilian populated areas , as a matter of policy ” , with total impunity , not once being denounced by HRW for committing war crimes .
Too clever by half , Roth apparently believed no one would notice this sudden about - face .
As the devastation of the Gaza Strip continued apace , and the death toll reached horrific levels , it was becoming increasingly clear that civilians were very much in Israel ’s crosshairs .
In an orgy of organized savagery entire families were obliterated with the press of a button ; refugees were herded into buildings , the premises shelled , and survivors denied medical care and essential supplies for days afterward ; UN facilities , including the UNRWA headquarters and schools transformed into safe havens ( whose precise coordinates and functions were communicated to the Israeli military ) were repeatedly bombed ; women and children seeking refuge with white flags raised were summarily gunned down ; and entire neighborhoods were systematically razed to the ground .
Yet , from HRW ’s perspective , none of these acts — whether individually or collectively — merited the same characterization that had until 30 December 2008 been routinely meted out to their Palestinian adversaries .
As part of its response , the organization simply feigned ignorance .
“ Israel ’s refusal to grant access to Gaza for all international media and human rights monitors since the fighting began on December 27 ” , it complained on 12 January , “ has limited severely the flow of information and investigation from impartial observers into events on the ground ” .
“ Human Rights Watch , ” it had the cheek to report on 16 January , “ is unable to conduct full investigations into alleged laws of war violations by either side because of Israel ’s continuing denial of access to Gaza ” .
This despite the fact that the Gaza Strip was saturated with Arab journalists , local and international humanitarian staff , medical personnel including several Europeans , and approximately 1.5 million residents most of whom had at least intermittent access to telecommunications .
Yet none of these , apparently , met the criteria of credible witness .
Indeed , HRW ’s main and almost exclusive source of reliable information consisted of staff located on the Israeli side of the boundary on account of Israel and Egypt ’s ban on entry to the Gaza Strip .
HRW ’s insistence on the most scrupulous standards of quality control for information emanating from the Gaza Strip , while in principle laudable , stands in rather sharp contrast to its operations in Ba’thist Iraq , where much more severe restrictions did n’t preclude the organization from concocting stories about babies thrown out of incubators and issuing detailed accounts of genocide .
Similarly , even during the Gaza conflict HRW had no problem lending its imprimatur to reports of state repression of pro-Palestinian demonstrations in Iran , Saudi Arabia , and Tunisia – countries in which it was also denied access .
“ Gaza Crisis : Regimes React with Routine Repression ” , issued on 21 January , did n’t hesitate to assert as fact various beatings and arrests in the darker parts of the Middle East , using precisely those forensic methods deemed insufficiently impartial in the Gaza Strip .
Nor did denial of access prevent HRW from denouncing such regimes for throwing not one but two shoes at their people — a wholly appropriate turn of phrase but also the type of rhetoric one never sees deployed when addressing the question of Israel .
At several points HRW ’s coverage of the conflict descended to the level of obscenity .
On 16 January , in a press release entitled “ Israel : Stop Shelling Crowded Gaza City ” , the organization once again provides an accurate account , based primarily on the testimony of HRW senior military analyst Marc Garlasco , of the facts — in this case Israel ’s use of heavy artillery against the centre of Gaza City , including the shelling of UNRWA headquarters with white phosphorous .
Yet rather than conclude that a war crime had been perpetrated , or even suggest that the time may be ripe for investigation and accountability , the microphone is handed to Israel ’s Prime Minister : “ Ehud Olmert apologized for the attack , but said Israeli forces had come under fire from the UN compound .
‘ It is absolutely true that we were attacked from that place , but the consequences are very sad and we apologize for it ’ , he said ” .
Curiously , UNRWA officials , who are quoted elsewhere in the press release describing the attack , are not cited as “ categorically rul[ing ] out any possibility that militants had been firing from the compound , ” as they had to the Associated Press and other media .
Nor is the lay reader informed about the legality of the attack even if Olmert ’s version of events was substantiated , or of the consequences in terms of accountability even if he was genuinely saddened and apologetic .
Indeed , the only reference to an investigation is to the one HRW was purportedly unable to conduct .
Further down the same press release reports : “ Israeli fire also hit the al - Shurouq tower , which houses media outlets such as Reuters , al - Arabiyya Television , and al - Hayat newspaper , causing substantial damage and wounding at least two journalists . . .
Media organizations had provided the Israeli military with the GPS locations of all their offices .
Israeli forces told the media that they had come under fire from the building ” .
Seemingly , the recently pardoned war criminals of Hamas successfully transformed the building into the headquarters of their rocket battalion without even being noticed by the dozens of journalists and their dozens of cameras in , on and around the building — though a more likely explanation is that the journalists , all of them Arab , fail to meet Roth ’s standards for “ impartial observers into events on the ground ” .
The press release then states , “ Human Rights Watch is unable to conduct full investigations into alleged laws of war violations by either side because of Israel ’s continuing denial of access to Gaza .
Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups have also violated the laws of war by continuing to fire unguided Qassam and Grad rockets at population centers in Israel . ”
Once again , HRW insists on having it both ways :
If violations can only be alleged pending confirmation by exhaustive investigations in situ , how can a mere reference to the type of weapon used by one party prove sufficient for finding that it has in fact committed such violations ?
By the time the reader gets to the final paragraph of the press release , a recommendation to Israel to “ Collect and analyze data regarding Palestinian civilian casualties from artillery shelling in order to assess the harm to civilians caused by the use of artillery in particular locales and situations , and thus to base targeting decisions on a proper weighing of foreseeable civilian harm ” , the reader could be forgiven for reading this as an exhortation for further Israeli shelling to ensure sufficient data is collected .
The low point of HRW ’s coverage of Israel ’s onslaught on the Gaza Strip was not its consistent refusal to apply a single standard — whether legal or rhetorical — to Israel and the Palestinians , nor its effective contribution to Israeli impunity , but rather a personal betrayal of an HRW colleague in his hour of greatest need .
“ On the afternoon of January 3 , 2009 ” , according to HRW ’s “ Israel : Investigate Former Judge ’s Killing in Gaza ” ( issued on 9 January ) , “ an Israeli bomb or missile from an F - 16 jet fighter killed the two Gazans at the al - Ghoul farm , northwest of Beit Lahiya and close to Gaza ’s border with Israel .
Akram al - Ghoul was a judge who worked in the Palestinian Authority courts and resigned after Hamas took over the Gaza Strip in June 2007 .
He is the father of Fares Akram , Human Rights Watch ’s research consultant in Gaza .
Mahmoud al - Ghoul , 17 , was a student ” .
One aspect of the question of Israel on which HRW has pulled considerably fewer punches than others concerns internal investigations conducted by the Israeli military .
Only two days before it issued the above press release , in fact , in a separate press release entitled “ Gaza : Israeli Attack on School Needs Full UN Investigation ” , the organization noted that according to its previous studies of the matter , “ IDF investigations into alleged laws - of - war violations , when they have occurred , have been deeply flawed . . .
To Human Rights
Watch ’s knowledge , Israel never conducted impartial and thorough investigations of those [ previously recounted ] incidents or held any of its military personnel accountable .
During Israel ’s last major ground offensive in Gaza in March 2008 , Human Rights Watch found that Israeli forces committed several targeted killings and other serious violations of the laws of war .
To date , no IDF investigation has taken place in these cases ” .
Yet how did Kenneth Roth and the world ’s leading human rights organization respond to the killing of their colleague ’s father and relative ?
“ Human Rights Watch today called on the Israel Defense Forces ( IDF ) to conduct a thorough and impartial investigation into the deaths by an Israeli airstrike of Akram al - Ghoul , 48 , and Mahmoud Salah Ahman al - Ghoul , 17 , the father and cousin of Human Rights Watch ’s research consultant in Gaza .
In a letter to Brig . - Gen. Avichai Mandelblit , IDF Military Advocate General , Human Rights
Watch urged the military to investigate the attack , make the results of the investigation public , and prosecute any persons it finds to have acted in serious violation of international humanitarian law ” .
HRW did n’t even bother to go through the motions of calling for an “ independent ” investigation of the killing of their Arab informant ’s father .
In doing so , HRW chose to pursue justice for a colleague by steering his case into what they better than perhaps any others know to be meaningless dead end .
The impression that the murder of Fares Akram ’s father was instrumentalised by HRW to lend a much - needed veneer of respectability to the Israeli military ’s investigations of itself is particularly reprehensible .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Motorola Inc MOT.N is betting on Google Inc's GOOG .O Android cellphone software to liven up its next generation of devices , but analysts doubt it is enough to revive the fortunes of the mobile phone maker .
The decision by Motorola Co-Chief Executive Sanjay Jha to pare the mobile devices unit by 25 percent , and to scale back the number of devices and software platforms Motorola develops , are practical moves for a company whose phone sales dropped by a half in just a year .
But even analysts who recommend Motorola shares do not expect these plans to soon revive the company , which is fighting increasingly stiff competition with fewer resources and demoralized workers .
“ I ’m bullish on the stock , not at all on the handsets , ” said Goldman analyst Simona Jankowski .
“ I feel their position in handsets is awful and will get worse . ”
Jankowski only recommends Motorola shares on the premise that the price does not reflect the value of non-handset businesses , such as television set - top boxes and wireless network gear , and an estimate that an implied valuation handicap of $ 5 billion for the cellphone unit is too severe .
Motorola shares have fallen more than 60 percent in the last year , giving the company a market value of $ 10.28 billion on Monday , based on a share price of $ 4.55 .
Analysts say Motorola will find it tough to compete in a cutthroat market where the focus has turned to software and inventive user interfaces , such as touchscreens popularized by Apple Inc's AAPL.O iPhone .
“ That ’s extraordinarily difficult .
Motorola has never shown it can innovate in software , ever , ” said Current Analysis analyst Avi Greengart .
He said Motorola ’s strength in hardware shown by phones such as Razr , a hit in 2004 and 2005 , and the Renew , its latest device made from recycled bottles , would be little help .
“ They ’re competing in a software era using hardware and their products have been stale for two years , ” Greengart said .
BET ON ANDROID
Many analysts welcomed Motorola ’s decision to develop a phone for later this year using Google ’s open - source Android operating system , instead of several rival systems including home - grown software .
But the problem is that rivals are also using Android .
“ If you come out with a plain vanilla Android phone in the second half , you ’re no better off , ” said Greengart .
Besides iPhone , market leader Nokia NOK1V.HE , and Android rivals such as HTC Corp 2498 .
TW , Motorola also needs to battle Palm Inc PALM .O and its highly anticipated Pre phone , and Research In Motion RIM .
TO , whose BlackBerry email phones have a passionately loyal following .
And Jha has to do this with 5,000 fewer cellphone workers .
Nobody disputes the need for cost cuts to reflect shrinking sales , and some analysts are looking for more .
But company morale is a worry .
“ My sense is that handset employees are more concerned about job security than getting the new products out , ” said American Technology Research analyst Mark McKechnie .
These employees will be further tested in the coming months as analysts expect continuing market share losses and device sale unit declines for at least two more quarters .
The company on Tuesday posted a fourth - quarter loss and it said it was suspending its quarterly dividend and looking for a new Chief Financial Officer .
Motorola slid to fifth place in the global handset market in the fourth quarter , down one notch from the quarter before .
Goldman ’s Jankowski sees Motorola phone sales falling to 14 million in the current quarter and to 13 million in the June quarter , before edging back up to 20 million in December .
UBS analyst Maynard
Um said it makes sense for the company to focus on keeping its carrier customers up to date while it develops the new phone .
He noted that Motorola still has a recognizable brand and an established distribution channel working in its favor .
“ There ’s always a chance they will ( recover ) ” he said .
“ Is it going to be more difficult ?
Absolutely . ”
Going green was big news for a while , then the collapsing economy put a cloud over the movement .
Nonetheless , a derth of reporting does n’t mean that the scientists , entrepreneurs , and business brains behind the burgeoning industry have slowed down .
If anything , their products are growing in maturity and potential .
We waded through hundreds of eco-oriented companies to pick out the ones with the most promise , in terms of product potential and marketability .

The car only costs $ 0.02 / mile to power , but its price tag is in the hundreds of thousands .
Nonetheless , the eco-hip rich of Silicon Valley and Los Angeles have snapped up the roadsters like hotcakes .
Tesla ’s next car , the Model S , is slated to be released in 2010 .
Its comparatively modest $ 60,000 price tag puts it up against luxury sedans like the Audi A6 .
Tesla also has successful divisions that sell battery packs , powertrains , and solar chargers .
2. Calera
California - based Calera specializes in carbon capture and storage .
In lay terms , that means diverting carbon dioxide emissions from factory smokestacks and running them through calcium - and magnesium - rich seawater to create cement .
The CO2 gets turned into carbonates , making cement instead of polluting the atmosphere .
Calera wants to replace Portland cement — 120 + million metric tons of which the US uses in roads , sidewalks , and buildings a year — with its more eco-friendly product .
If allowed to piggyback on coal and natural gas plants in the United States , Calera could do some major carbon cleaning cum cement production .

President Barrack Obama ’s first press conference ( 2/9 ) was dominated by economy issue that was the main objective of the event .
Out of 13 questions , 8 were related to economy , while three dealt with foreign policy : Afghanistan , Iran and Pakistan ’s FATA region .
The President ’s responses to the issues of Afghanistan , Iran and Pakistan ’s FATA region were very vivid and clear .
However , when it came to Israel , though the question was indirect and implicit , his response was ambiguous and dubious .
The White House veteran journalist , Helen Thomas , asked : “ Do you know of any country in the Middle East that has nuclear weapons ? ”
Although former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres in July 1998 that Israel " built a nuclear option , not in order to have a Hiroshima but an Oslo , " President Obama declined to answer the question by saying :
“ With respect to nuclear weapons , you know , I do n't want to speculate .
What I know is this : that if we see a nuclear arms race in a region as volatile as the Middle East , everybody will be in danger . ”
He went on to say : “ And one of my goals is to prevent nuclear proliferation generally .
I think that it 's important for the United States , in concert with Russia , to lead the way on this .
And you know , I 've mentioned this in conversations with the Russian president , Mr. Medvedev , to let him know that it is important for us to restart the conversation , about how we can start reducing our nuclear arsenals in an effective way , so that . ”
It is an open secret now that Israel is the world 's sixth most powerful nuclear state , with a stockpile of more than 100 nuclear weapons and with the components and ability to build atomic , neutron and hydrogen bombs .
( The Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control ’s Risk Report of July 1996 )
The first public revelation of Israel 's nuclear capability ( as opposed to development program ) came in the London based Sunday Times on 5 October 1986 , which printed information provided by Mordechai Vanunu , formerly employed at the Negev Nuclear Research Center , a facility located in the Negev desert south of Dimona .
After being abducted from Italy , Vanunu was tried in Israel and sentenced to 18 years in prison for treason and espionage .
Although there had been much speculation prior to Vanunu 's revelations that the Dimona site was creating nuclear weapons , Vanunu 's information indicated that Israel had also built thermonuclear weapons .
( Wikipedia )
According to the Federation of American Scientists by the late 1990s the U.S. Intelligence Community estimated that Israel possessed between 75 - 130 weapons , based on production estimates .
The stockpile would certainly include warheads for mobile Jericho - 1 and Jericho - 2 missiles , as well as bombs for Israeli aircraft , and may include other tactical nuclear weapons of various types .
The US had been hypocritical about Iran , approaching it with very different standards than it has for Israel , India or even itself .
The US is seeking to prevent Iran having a uranium enrichment program , even though there is no evidence that it is being used for weapons production .
By contrast , the US has never said boo to Israel for having a nuclear weapons program and for manufacturing actual nuclear devices .
And Pakistan and India are allies of the US , despite having acquired nuclear weapons outside the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) .
In this matter , double standards abound .
At the same time as it is demanding that Iran abandon uranium enrichment , the US is offering India access to nuclear materials and equipment for the expansion of its nuclear power program .
This offer reverses a 30 - year old US policy of denying nuclear materials and equipment to India , which was prompted by India ’s first nuclear weapons test in 1974 .
If the deal goes through , India will acquire the status , and the privileges , of a “ nuclear - weapon ” state like the five official “ nuclear weapon ” states .
This is going to happen , even though India has never signed the NPT and ca n’t sign it now without giving up its nuclear weapons – which it is n’t going to do .

The other day , I was playing Spider Solitaire on an XP box .
To be honest , it was pretty fun .
Then , I ran into a problem :
( OK , OK , I could n’t resist the “ Fail ” in there , I ’m sorry )
Now there ’s two ways of looking at this .
One is that I was too dumb to think ahead , and save enough cards to fill up all the spaces , and proceed to the next round .
The other way is to say “ What the heck ?
What idiot would make a game with an impossible situtation like that !?
One in which , if you do too well , you ca n’t win !?!?! ”
Anarchist that I am , I picked the third way , which is :
On a game designed to be simple , easy and fun–one that you ’re not even supposed to take seriously , could n’t somebody ’ve had the grace to add the few extra lines of code which would go something like :
if active_cards < spaces
{
fill_spaces_to_proceed = 0 ; //Disables the requirement to fill up all the spaces
}
OK , OK , I ’m sure I ’m oversimplifying it ( and do n’t even say a word about my C skills … or lack thereof ) .
But the point remains–simple error - catching would ’ve made me , a paying customer , a happier camper .
Just for fun , let ’s contrast this to OpenSpider , a fictional open source clone of Spider Solitaire .
If I discovered this bug while playing OpenSpider , I ’d pop over to the developer ’s website , and send a polite email saying that I really thought it ’d be better if it was the other way .
Better yet , if the guy had Bugzilla installed , I ’d just file a bug .
What you ’re probably thinking now is that I ’m making a mountain out of a molehill , and that it ’s just a minor irritation in a very minor game ( what ’s more , I ’ve been playing it for years , and this is the first time it ’s happened to me ) .
However , I think it serves as a good microcosm for one of the differences between free software and freeware .
With free software , the developers are legitimately interested in making a good product .
I could expand on that a lot , but that ’s really what it boils down to in this case .
With freeware , there ’s always some kind of a catch .
A lot of freeware is merely some kind of stunted trial version , and the developers are hoping you ’ll spend some cashy money on the full / professional / etc. version .
In other cases , like this one , freeware is a way of binding you to something .
If Spider Solitaire was open source , there ’d be a Linux / BSD / Mac / Solaris / … port in days .
But since it ’s proprietary , only Microsoft can have it , and only people who pay through the nose for Windows can play it .
Granted , Microsoft is doing a terrible job on providing free Windows - only perks .
The few games , Notepad , Wordpad , Calculator … there are better open source versions ( AisleRiot , gedit , gedit / OpenOffice , any one of a number of calculators … )
If Microsoft was playing more aggressively , they ’d include stuff like a dumbed - down version of MS Office – not a 60 day trial , but a fully working , limited - feature freeware version , to strengthen the chains between people and Windows .
( Un ) Fortunately , they ’re too interested in the revenue they get from selling full version of Office to try such a stunt .
Enter OpenOffice .
Now let ’s take a look from the other side of the aisle–what if all Linux distros , and everything that came with them , were GNU / Linux - only freeware ?
Some people would switch to GNU / Linux because of Firefox alone ( OK , so maybe it ’d be a dual - boot , but there ’s no shame in that ) .
Once you throw in OpenOffice , Thunderbird , Pidgin … the Ubuntu servers would go down with .iso downloads , and ShipIt would close up shop .
Now obviously that ’s not happening –there ’s enough open source zealots out there ( for example : myself ) to make sure it never does .
And that makes me feel a lot better about losing a Solitaire game .
India has long held the record as the world 's largest consumer of gold .
But now China is catching up .
For me and many Indians , China is a constant reminder of what we are not , and what we could be if we tried hard enough .
We compare ourselves to China constantly : computer programmer cousins of mine come home to laud the skyscrapers of Shanghai and the ring roads of Beijing .
But I for one will be quite happy to see the day India falls behind in the gold race .
India 's huge appetite for gold has its origins in deep - rooted customs .
The birth of a new baby prompts the new mother 's parents to buy , as is their duty , gold for the grandchild – which for most Indians means a small chain , anklets and even a gold loin chain .
When a young girl comes of age , it falls to uncles to come visiting laden with jewels and gifts .
Then the girl gets married .
This is where the fun begins .
This time it is not just the maternal uncles and grandparents who cough up .
The mother of the bride is stripped of her ornaments , which are converted to new gold .
Assuming her daughter conceives , a ceremony takes place in the seventh month of her pregnancy , when she receives further jewels and anything left over from the promised dowry .
As a young trainee doctor , I used to look after women in the burns ward .
It is an unpleasant task for anyone , but to the sole female trainee goes the job of delivering all the premature babies whose mother 's body has been badly burned , and thus rejects the added burden of another life .
In the burns unit , the women always outnumbered men with ease ; and never once in my difficult time there have I seen a mother - in - law on whom the kerosene stove had " accidentally " fallen .
Night after night I lay shivering and waiting for the call .
It was always either young men who had burned themselves in an attempt to take their own lives , or it was the daughter - in - law .
Many times she was seven to eight months pregnant – the time when her family are expected to arrive laden with gifts .
One can do nothing but wonder at the timing of the stoves and kerosene lamps .
By the time I finished my placement there , I stopped even speculating about such things ; I was on to more practical issues – doing a preferential mapping of the burns area : please God , let there be no burns on the abdomen ; it will be difficult to listen to the baby .
The scenario among the middle classes in India is quite different .
Shortly before a cousin's wedding recently , I helped my aunt sort out the bride 's jewels .
The necklaces , bangles and earrings had to be worn for different ceremonies and the same jewel could not be worn twice .
I told her that I had heard that even the Queen of England wore the same jewellery more than once .
I was asked to leave my English ideas back in England .
And I assure you that mine is just an upper middle class family .
As I took a breath of fresh air that night , I watched a pig wallowing in the gutter of the sewage channel that runs along the front of the house .
Should n't one deal with open sewage before hoarding diamonds and gold ?
But what do I know ?
I sounded my uncle out .
He asked what would happen if " luxuries " like clearing the sewage and the pig stood in the way of my cousin getting a well settled life .
What if they meant we could n't afford the extra 20g of gold as a dowry for the boy with a good job in America ?
In India , gold is not just a litmus test of one 's status .
For many , it defines every rite of passage – leaving cherished memories for the haves , scarred minds and bodies for the have - nots .
My mother jokingly asks me to marry and have children soon .
If they are girls , then it will be up to her to save their dowry for them : they will have a careless , absentminded workaholic for a mother .
I , for one , will be proud to have daughters who will not wear gold during their weddings .
And I hope there will be a day when every Indian mother - in - law will be happy to have a no - gold marriage .
Until then , go , China , go .
All the waste and incompetence of the ID card scheme becomes plain when you hear people 's stories about their contact with the new UK Borders Agency .
This one comes from an acquaintance , who would prefer to remain anonymous , chiefly because he fears retribution if his name is known .
It started when his wife , a foreign national , applied under the new laws for her card , which was then issued with a mistake .
He writes :
In early January , my wife and I visited a UK Border Agency office and paid £ 595 for their ' premium ' service to take her biometric data and process her foreign national ID card .
We waited for hours as they had lots of computer problems , until finally a staff member admitted to us that the ' ID system was down ' and had been the previous day also .
We were eventually told that the details had been taken and we should just wait for her ID card to arrive by post .
When the card finally arrived we soon discovered that they had got her nationality wrong .
She is a US citizen and on the back of her ID card it said ' American Samoa ' !
We reported the problem and were told to post the ID card back to them in a Freepost envelope .
Weeks later the UK Border Agency sent my wife a letter saying that she needed to send her passport , as they could not correct their mistake without her passport .
My correspondent makes the following points .
The agency had already recorded the passport details and scanned it .
His wife has paid for a ' premium ' service ( £ 595 ) appointment at UK Border Agency where she was fingerprinted , photographed and filled in forms so that she would not have to send her passport by post .
When she phoned UKBA twice to report that " American Samoan " was a mistake , she spoke to two people , who told her to send the incorrect ID card only and did not mention sending a passport .
She explained that she would need the ID card back soon in case she had to travel abroad .
He says that the letter received from UKBA instructed - " Please send your passport to the Freepost address as above " .
There was no Freepost address shown anywhere on the letter , or on the envelope .
He continues :
After a very long phone queue , I spoke to a nice lady on the UKBA helpline ( 0300 123 2412 ) who was highly amused at the ' American Samoa ' mistake , but said that unfortunately , yes , we would need to send her passport by post , but that we should also phone another UKBA number regarding a possible refund of part of our ' premium ' fee .
Another long phone queue ensued and he spoke to what he describes as an unpleasant man at the UKBA immigration enquiry bureau ( 0870 606 7766 ) regarding a possible refund :
He was very irritable , dismissive and patronising , but then he admitted it was not his decision to make and gave him an address for UK Border Agency complaints at Lunar House in Croydon .
When I heard the name Croydon I said to him : ' Oh , we heard about the Croydon office when we were waiting at the UK Border Agency Offices for hours during your system crash in early January , we heard the Border Agency staff talking about it . '
The man conceded that there was systems crash and hurriedly hung up .
As of writing this , my wife is still without an ID card and now does n't have her passport either .
I am passing this story on because I have had my first taste of what a state with ID cards would be like , and I have found it very depressing and actually much more scary than I thought I would .
The reality of this apparently secure and efficient ID card system is that it is wide open to human error , technical failures and abuse .
A mistake on an ID card will take a very long time to correct , and their mistake becomes your problem , your responsibility .
It is a very disempowering and depressing process where a citizen becomes a cog in a vast machine .
This is not just your video club membership , or your supermarket loyalty card ... this is your citizenship and identity , allowing you access to services and allowing you to leave and enter the country .
My wife has been unable to travel since early January because of this mistake by UKBA .
We are hoping no family emergencies occur before UKBA get around to returning her passport and ID card .
I still have a slight worry that if we complain publicly then someone within UKBA may have the power to vindictively sabotage my wife 's future leave to remain in the UK ... not something I have ever feared before in this country .
I also do n't want my wife to end up being deported to Samoa by mistake !
I reproduce this story at length because it captures the anger and helplessness experienced when you become ensnared in a system that is flawed , contemptuous of individual needs and entirely pointless .
Conservative Denver billionaire Philip Anschutz looked like an up - and - coming mogul in the midst of the Bush administration , but now the funder of anti-gay groups is losing his partners .
Anschutz , notoriously secretive , made his money in the oil business and through Qwest Communications , which paid huge fines to the federal government for signing up long distance customers against their will and for an accounting scandal .
A few years ago , he was intriguing new media mogul .
He had started the Examiner chain of giveaway daily newspapers , which stretches from San Francisco to Washington , DC .
And he produced the movie " Chronicles of Narnia : The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe " with Disney , eventually grossing more than $ 700 million .
His well - documented support for Colorado 's anti-gay Amendment 2 and groups like Colorado for Family Values were often noted but generally not seen as a hindrance .
Maybe they were n't , but something seems to be going wrong :
In 2008 , a joint movie venture with 20th Century Fox all but ended ; the co-founder of Anschutz 's film company Walden Media made a surprise departure ; and now , reports Variety , Disney is pulling away , declining to finance the third " Narnia " film after the second grossed an apparently disappointing $ 419 million .
Walden , meanwhile , is only making about one quarter as many movies as originally planned .
And does anyone really think the giveaway newspaper business could possibly be going well ?
His fall from grace has n't come as quickly as , say , Sam Zell's , but Anschutz is well on his way to becoming another failed , would - be crossover media mogul .
He can always blame the gays !

The FDA has admitted that meat and milk from the offspring of cloned mammals such as cows , pigs , goats and sheep could very well have already entered the food supply in the United States .
" It is theoretically possible , " agency spokesperson Siobhan DeLancey said .
In January , the FDA declared that foods derived from cloned animals and their offspring were safe for human consumption .
The U.S. Department of Agriculture , however , asked food companies to voluntarily maintain a ban on products from clones .
The voluntary ban did not extend to the offspring of cloned animals .
Clones are organisms artificially developed directly from the DNA of a single organism , rather than the mixing that is difficult in sexual reproduction .
They are made by implanting the nucleus of an adult cell into an egg cell , which is then incubated by a surrogate mother .
According to critics of the technology , very little research has been conducted on the safety of consuming meat or dairy products from clones or their offspring , thus making it premature to bring such products to market .
"
It worries me that this technology is out of control in so many ways , " said Charles Margulis of the Center for Environmental Health .
He said that the FDA 's announcement that clones ' offspring might already been food supply " is just another element of that .
" A number of major U.S. food producers have announced that they will not use any ingredients derived from cloned animals , due in part to safety concerns .
Companies enforcing a ban on clone products include Smithfield Foods , General Mills , Campbell Soup , Nestle , California Pizza Kitchen , Supervalu , Kraft Foods and Tyson Foods , the largest meat company in the United States .
Kraft said that consumer demand influenced its decision .
" Research in the United States indicates that consumers are currently not receptive to ingredients from cloned animals , " said Director of Corporate Affairs Susan Davison .

Nearly one - fifth of all Californians under age 65 were without health insurance for all or some of 2007 , according to a policy brief released today by the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research .
Drawing on comprehensive new data from the California Health Interview Survey ( CHIS ) , the policy brief 's authors found that 6.4 million Californians lacked any health insurance coverage for all or some of 2007 , the most recent year for which comprehensive statewide data is available .
This number represents 19.5 percent of all Californians under age 65 , which is slightly lower than the uninsured rate of 20.2 percent in 2005 .
However , the gains were small and are now likely to be reversed by the current recession , according to the authors of the brief , " Nearly 6.4 Million Californians Lacked Health Insurance in 2007 . "
" We 're looking at the final year of an economic expansion and yet the gains in coverage were small , " said lead author E. Richard Brown , director of the Center for Health Policy Research .
" If the employer - based system can't increase health insurance in good times , how will they do it in bad ?
The answer is : they can't .
Only comprehensive health care reform will change the equation . "
In 2003 , the state 's unemployment rate rose to 6.8 percent , which was a main driver of the decline in employment - based insurance from 56.4 percent in 2001 to 53.8 percent in 2003 .
Today in California , the statewide unemployment rate is more than 8 percent and is predicted to rise .
" It suggests we are now in for an even more severe decline in employment - based insurance than in 2003 , " said co-author and senior research associate Shana Alex Lavarreda .
Funded by grants from the California Endowment and the California Wellness Foundation , the policy brief brief draws on the latest comprehensive data from the CHIS , the largest state health survey in the nation .
That data was collected from more than 50,000 Californians , including adults , teenagers and children , on a range of health topics .
" Our current system of health coverage locks too many families out , " said Dr. Robert K. Ross , president and chief executive officer of the California Endowment .
" We desperately need a system that ensures all Californians have access to health coverage , regardless of heath status , income and employment . "
Easily searchable CHIS data on uninsurance and other topics by state , region and county can be found at www.askchis.com.
A quick summary of health insurance statistics by county or region is available at the Center for Health Policy Research 's updated Health SNAPSHOTS .
" This policy brief is another example of the critical information that the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research is able to provide through analysis of data from the California Health Interview Survey , " said Gary L. Yates , president and CEO of the California Wellness Foundation .
" It is difficult to overestimate the relevance of this data source in times like these , when so many Californians lack adequate health coverage . "

The fourth alpha version of the upcoming Ubuntu 8.10 ( codename Intrepid Ibex ) , which is scheduled for release in late October this year , was made available a few minutes ago and , as usual , we intend to keep you up - to - date with the latest changes in the Ubuntu 8.10 development .
Compared with the third alpha , which brought you the Nautilus file manager ( with tabs ) , this version comes with the old Human - Murrine ( white ) theme , some new features and a lot of bug fixes .
First of all , let 's take a quick look at the included applications :
? Kernel 2.6.26 -5 ( based on Linux kernel 2.6.26.2 ) ?
X. Org Server 1.5 ?
Mozilla Firefox 3.0.1 ?
OpenOffice.org 2.4.1 ?
The GIMP 2.4.6 ?
F - Spot 0.4.4 ?
Pidgin 2.4.3 ?
Brasero 0.8.0 ?
Transmission 1.22 ?
Rhythmbox 0.11.6 ?
Ekiga 2.0.12 ?
Evolution 2.23.6 ?
Nautilus 2.23.6.1 ?
Vinagre 2.23.4
For the Intrepid Ibex , the development team will prepare an unbelievable desktop , with amazing performance , that will work on mostly any computer ( be it a high - end workstation or an old and dusty Pentium III machine ) .
Another major feature planned for Ubuntu 8.10 is the ability to be connected to the Internet ( wireless connections ) wherever you go : " We want you to be able to move from the office , to the train , and home , staying connected all the way , " said Mark Shuttleworth .
With Alpha 4 , the development team introduces Private Directory Encryption , which allows every user to encrypt one or more folders with sensitive data .
A guest session ( a password - less user account with restricted privileges ) can be started from the GNOME 's User Switching Applet , ideal if you want to let someone , for a short period of time , surf the Internet , chat with friends or check his / her e-mail address from your personal computer or laptop .
Moreover , Ubuntu 8.10 Alpha 4 brings you a greatly improved version of the Network Manager tool , which will allow you to manage 3G connections ( GSM / CDMA ) , PPP and PPPoE connections , routes , static IP configurations and multiple active devices .
Last but not least , Vinagre is working again in this version .
Here is the screenshot tour of this fourth alpha release of Ubuntu 8.10 :
As you can see from the above screenshots , the NewHuman theme ( yes , the black one ) is GONE , but the default theme is ugly ( actually , it is not installed correctly ) .
However , selecting the Human - Murrine theme will do the trick .
And I can even see some nice improvements in it , especially on the buttons .
Once again , the development team failed to implement an " Encrypt system " option in the Live Installer ( I sure hope it will be available on future releases ) , but they 've implemented an " Automatically sign in " option on the fifth step ( see the first screenshot on the third row ) .
Let 's have a look now at the release schedule for Intrepid Ibex :
June 27th , 2008 - Alpha 1 release July 11th , 2008 - Alpha 2 release July 24th , 2008 - Alpha 3 release August 14th , 2008 - Alpha 4 release September 4th , 2008 - Alpha 5 release September 18th , 2008 - Alpha 6 release October 2nd , 2008 - Beta release October 23rd , 2008 - Release Candidate October 30th , 2008 - Final release of Ubuntu 8.10 .

The 16th president of the United States , Abraham Lincoln was born 200 years ago tomorrow , on February 12 , 1809 .
Here are Ten Fun facts About Lincoln .
10 . Lincoln under-utilized his pockets
Lincoln ’s stovepipe top hat served as more than fashionable headwear .
He used it to store and carry notes , letters , even bills .
Why do they call it a stovepipe hat ?
Well , the rise is so tall and straight up and down with no flair that it resembles a length of pipe .
They ’re hard to come by nowadays , the traditional top hat being much more current , but still pretty “ retro ” .
Best you go to a custom haberdashery to get one made just for you .
9. Lincoln was really tall
That stovepipe hat just made a tall guy a whole lot taller .
Lincoln was 6 ’ 4 ” , making him our country ’s tallest president .
That of course begs the question , who was our shortest president ?
4th president James Madison stood a stately 5 ’ 4 ” , making him an entire foot shorter than Honest Abe – even without his hat !
8. Lincoln has no living heirs
Despite the fact that the marriage between Abraham Lincoln and Mary Todd Lincoln yielded 4 sons , there are no living heirs .
Three of the four sons died before their 20th birthdays : Edward died at 4 years of age , Willie at 12 years , at Tad at 18 .
Robert was the only child who lived into adulthood and his last descendent died sometime in the 1980’s .
7. Lincoln ’s son Robert was a death - magnet
Speaking of Robert , he was sort of a magnet for tragedy .
More specifically , presidential assassination tragedy .
While he was not present when his dad was killed , he was an eyewitness to Garfield ’s assassination , and at the same World ’s Fair where McKinley was assassinated .
Another interesting fact about Robert , he was saved from a train accident by Edwin Booth , the brother of his father ’s killer , John Wilkes Booth .
6. Lincoln Liked to Tinker
Lincoln really liked machines and gadgets .
He liked to take them apart to see how they worked and try to put them together again .
He even tried his hand at inventing , and in 1849 had a patent issued for “ A Device for Buoying Vessels Over Shoals ” .
The machine never made it , but the patent was a new thing for a president , and no president has held a patent since .
5. Lincoln & Kennedy
You did n’t think we ’d leave it out , did you ?
There are some pretty bizarre coincidences between Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy .
Here are a couple :
Both were shot in the head with one bullet on a Friday .
Lincoln was elected to Congress in 1846 , Kennedy in 1946 .
Lincoln ’s successor ( named Johnson ) was born in 1808 .
Kennedy ’s successor ( also named Johnson ) was born in 1908 .
Lincoln ’s assassin ( who went by three names : John Wilkes Booth ) was born in 1839 .
Kenney ’s assassin ( who also went by three names : Lee Harvey Oswald ) was born in 1939 .
4. Lincoln was kind of psychic
In the weeks before his death , Lincoln was extremely melancholy .
He had seen portents of his own death , and had been dreaming of death as well .
On one occasion looked in the mirror and saw a double reflection , one image much paler and blurrier than the other .
He told his wife that he thought it meant that he had survived his first term , but would n’t survive his second .
The week prior to his death , Lincoln had a dream of hearing crying in a distant room of the White House .
He sought out the room and found that it had a coffin in it .
He asked the weeping person who had died and the person responded that it was the President .
In his dream , Lincoln looked into the coffin and saw himself .

3. Lincoln dabbled in the occult
Not only did he get premonitions , he also believed in the occult .
Well , if he did n’t believe then he was at least willing to go along with it .
Because he and Mary had lost little Edward and Willie at such young ages , they actually held seances in the White House trying to contact their dearly departed .
Mrs. Lincoln also attended seances at the homes of famous mediums of the day .
Whether or not they made contact is unknown .
2. Lincoln was spiritual , not religious
Despite the last two facts , Lincoln said he was still a Christian .
He did n’t , however , feel it necessary to subscribe to a particular brand of Christianity .
Though many different sects try to claim him , Lincoln was 100 % non-denominational .
He never joined a church , did n’t say grace before meals , and spoke on a more spiritual level , rather than religious .
He did read the Bible quite often , and did have a highly developed spiritual governance .
When asked if he thought the Lord was on the side of the North in the Civil War , Lincoln responded , “ I am not at all concerned about that …
But it is my constant anxiety and prayer that I and this nation should be on the Lord ’s side . ”
1. Lincoln had a way with words
Not only was Lincoln spiritual and intelligent , he was also a heck of a speech writer .
He wrote his own speeches , and it is said that his famous Gettysburg Address was n’t even the best one !
Rumor has it that the speech Lincoln made to the Illinois Republican Convention on May 29 , 1856 was his best , but it was either so enthralling that nobody remembered to take notes , or it was so controversial that nobody was allowed to print them .
Either way , no record of it exists .

For too long , Hamas has held progress to ransom , choosing war over peace , destruction over development .
Israel 's objective is to take the initiative away from Hamas .
The pragmatic moderates of all sides need a new reality from which to find a diplomatic solution .
Unless we weaken Hamas , the moderates cannot succeed .
The international community , Israel and the pragmatic leadership of the Arab world must stand up to the extremism that threatens us all .
We must start the New Year in the spirit of Churchill .

Disaster will strike the Valley on March 10 , 2009 .
No , that 's not a prediction from the Mayan calendar .
It 's a mock event being held on or near Arizona State University 's Tempe campus to test the disaster readiness of local public safety officials and health care workers .
The " Coyote Crisis Campaign " is a five - day exercise taking place during ASU 's spring break in which 1,200 volunteers will pretend to be victims from an improvised explosive device .
Officials do n't have all the volunteers they need yet -- visit the campaign 's
Web site for registration info if you 've ever felt the need to play bomb victim ( or , to get serious for a sec , help with an important community chore ) .
The site of the fake explosion wo n't be announced ahead of time to make the drill more realistic , says ASU 's online newspaper .
Naturally , a real terrorist attack would be impossible with Obama as president , right ?
See the full news release from the Arizona Department of Public Safety below :
State of Arizona and Maricopa County getting ready to test disaster preparedness during five - day event beginning March 9 , 2009
Coyote Crisis Campaign ( CCC ) will focus on exercise planning issues surrounding an Improvised Explosive Device ( IED ) domestic terrorist attack
Approximately 25 hospitals from the Phoenix area will participate in the exercise along with police and fire departments from the federal , state , county and local levels
Coyote Crisis is a federal , state , local , and countywide disaster preparedness exercise being conducted March 9 - 13 , 2009 .
Approximately 1,200 volunteers will be used to assist in an important portion of this exercise on March 10th , 2009 .
The majority of the volunteers will be used as mock victims to assist in the evaluation of the State 's Mobile Medical Response ( MMR ) and the hospitals response to a domestic terrorist attack involving an " Improvised Explosive Device " .
" The region is assessing the ability of responding fire service participants from 10 to 15 different agencies to triage , treat and transport 100 victims in a four - hour time period following the mock detonation of an Improvised Explosive Device ( IED ) , " said Gil Damiani , Mesa Fire Department , Assistant Chief .
" The ASU Police Department and members from the Arizona Department of Public Safety , along with members from other local , state , and federal law enforcement agencies will participate in Coyote Crisis 2009 in an effort to build upon our already great working relationships .
Though several areas will be evaluated , we will focus heavily on interoperability and interaction with other emergency responders to control , mitigate , and recover from a major incident , " said Allen Clark , Arizona State University , Assistant Chief of Police .
" Approximately 25 hospitals from the Phoenix area will participate in the Coyote Crisis exercise .
Exercise objectives for participating hospitals include evaluating mass casualty management , fatality management , forensic evidence collection , family notification and reunification , and medical surge .
Special emphasis will be placed on the evaluation of interoperable communication plans and systems , " said Andrew Lawless , MBA , PMP - Section Chief , Education and Exercise , Public Health Emergency Preparedness , Arizona Department of Health Services .
We would like the media 's assistance in getting the word out to the public that this exercise will be taking place and that on the 10th of March they may see a significant amount of emergency services units , especially in the ASU area of Tempe , moving around the city in support of this exercise .
All factions of public safety , healthcare , and the business community will be tested throughout this week .

A professional ski photographer who took snapshots of a middle - aged skier left dangling half nude from a Blue Sky Basin chairlift could lose his job .
Marty Odom , a photographer for SharpShooter Imaging , said Wednesday that he is trying to save his job but when asked whether he ’ll be able to do so he said , “ I do n’t think so . ”
But in a posting to a snowboarding website , Odom wrote that “ the photo is worth it . ”
“ So much stuff has gotten said , ” Odom said .
He declined to comment further .
A call to a SharpShooter Imaging spokesperson was not immediately returned .
The company posts photographers at the top of all Vail ski lifts so that skiers can commission photographs of themselves skiing down the mountain .
Odom spotted the unnamed skier on New Year ’s Day after the skier boarded Vail ’s Skyline Express Lift .
When the skier had tried to board the lift the fold - down seat was n’t in its proper position , according to the website thesmokinggun.com .
He fell through the gap , and his right ski got caught , leaving him dangling head down with his pants down below his knees .
Odom ’s semi-nude pictures of the skier – representing by his own account his best work of the season – were printed in the Vail Daily and extensively on the Internet .
Vail Resorts spokeswoman Liz Biebl confirmed that the pictures are of the victim .
In a Tuesday night posting on Transworld Snowboarding , Odom said he was suspended the day after the photograph appeared in the Vail Daily and the man announced his intention to sue Vail Mountain .
Odom explained that when he shot some pictures he was on his day off and was carrying his own camera .
“ I pulled up to the lift line to see a naked man hanging from the chair lift .
I shot the best photo that I ’m going to shoot all year , ” he wrote in Transworld Snowboarding .

When people say that this Bianca Gascoigne chick ’s got a big head , they are n’t talking about her fucking ego .
They are n’t talking about how being a rich girl has got to her head and made her unbarable .
They are talking about her actual head and that shit is scaring me .
Sure you can try to convince me to look at those tits , because they are big and busting out and fucking retarded that I am sure she uses to distract from her retarded head , and by retarded I mean Downs Syndrome .

The authors of the paper in Science say it was meteors .
At each site the scientists looked at , the diamond layer in the rocks correlates to the date of the hypothesized impact .
Within the layer , the scientists report finding a multitude of diamond particles , all encased within carbon spheres .
“ We ’ve yet to find a single diamond above it , ” Dr. West said .
“ We ’ve yet to find a single diamond below it . ”
Image Scientists found microscopic diamonds in the black layer of rock at Murray Springs in Arizona .
Credit ... University of Oregon
Perhaps more telling , the scientists reported last month at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco , the carbon atoms inside some of the diamonds are lined up in a hexagonal crystal pattern instead of the usual cubic structure .
The hexagonal diamonds , formed by extraordinary heat and pressure , have been found only at impact craters and within meteorites and cannot be formed in forest fires or volcanic eruptions , Dr. West said .
Last year the scientists presented other evidence of an impact , including elevated levels of the element iridium .
At least some skeptics are not convinced .
“ The whole thing still does not make sense , and there are lots of contradictions , ” said Christian Koeberl , a professor of geological sciences at the University of Vienna in Austria .
His chief reservation is that there is no crater .
“ A body of this size does not just blow up without a trace in the atmosphere , ” Dr. Koeberl said .
“ Physics wo n’t have it . ”
Proponents have suggested that the meteor hit an ice sheet a couple of miles thick or that there was a series of smaller objects that exploded in the air .
But Dr. Koeberl said something hitting an ice sheet would still generate a hole in the ground underneath , and he questioned whether smaller impacts or air explosions would produce the shock waves needed to make diamonds .
You may have noticed the world 's media creaming its collective pants over the Obama inauguration yesterday , with superlatives every bit as hyperbolic as Obama 's speech was bland .
Gullible liberal columnists could n't get over the " magic " - it was like being five again , and Santa Claus was coming .
Everyone , it seems , got the chance to cry again , and to tell everyone else about how they cried , as well as where they were when they cried .
All of that stuff about Obama 's disappointing appointments , his bellicose language , the support for TARP and his Wall Street backers , and the silence over Gaza , was forgotten for one spellbound day , sprinkled with fairy dust and dubya pee .
Today , it 's back to the bad news .
The " trillion dollar crash " is fast becoming the multi-trillion dollar crash .
The US economy has continued to slump , despite the immense capital resources injected into the financial system .
As Doug Henwood points out , the statistics for December were horrendous .
Employment fell by over half a million , and the official unemployment rate is now 7.2 % ( sure to be a substantial underestimate ) .
Retail sales took a record dive of 10 % last year .
Almost one in four US banks was unprofitable in the third quarter of 2008 and things can only get worse .
The outgoing Bush regime estimated that the US economy would lose close to 3 million jobs over the next year .
As incomes plummet , the number of unpaid or ' troubled ' loans will increase .
TARP will soon have more sequels than Police Academy .
Obama 's elite supporters are sanguine about his ability to sort out the crisis .
Indeed , Obama would probably not have won had he not benefited from a surge in support after the collapse of Lehman Brothers .
Yet , the new Treasury Secretary ( and known tax - dodger ) , Timothy Geithner , collaborated with Hank Paulson 's disastrous decision to let Lehman Brothers go bust when he was chair of the New York Federal Reserve .
The incoming Obama administration promises a fiscal stimulus , which is vital , but it is not likely to be more interventionist than the Bush administration has been over the last few months .
On New Years Day alone , they threw $ 10bn at the Bank of America .
It now seems that the incoming admin is intent on rehabilitating the failed TARP strategy of buying up ' toxic stock ' , removing it from bank balance sheets and supposedly leaving a healthy , profit - making institution in its place .
This policy of socialising the losses while privatising the profits was exactly what made ' TARP I ' so unpopular .
Paulson actually abandoned the idea of buying toxic assets some time ago in favour of direct capital injections ( though with only nebulous commitments from the institutions receiving such funds ) , but Geithner is now pushing the strategy quite forcefully , while blunting the edge with a promise to help small businesses and ' working families ' .
No member of the incoming administration shows any signs of wanting to reverse the Bush administration 's pattern of buying non-voting stock in failing banks and allowing existing management to stick around with little or no alteration in their generous payments .
This means that the same people who helped bring us to this impasse continue to be rewarded , maintain their power , and have no incentive to act in a more accountable way .
More bad news .
The UK banking system is close to terminal .
Contrary to the insistence of the Treasury that we are better placed than other economies to weather the storm , New Labour have encouraged a disproportionately huge and powerful financial sector while allowing the manufacturing sector to slowly bleed to death .
Not only that , but the UK economy is uniquely reliant on overseas investment , which supports a third of all UK lending according to Will Hutton .
As the world banking system collapses and neighbouring economies shrink , we are unusually exposed .
As a result , unemployment is soaring - hitting just under 2 million by November ( earlier than even David Blanchflower predicted ) .
Current predictions are for unemployment to reach 3 million by 2010 .
Corporate profitability in the non-financial sector is sliding , which means that the resources for new investment are diminishing .
Consumers , lacking income and with a tightened credit market , are increasingly forced to rely on pawnbrokers and short - term moneylenders .
That will restrict their future spending even more .
Now , even the strongest City institutions , such as HSBC , are the subject of reports suggesting they need urgent recapitalisation .
They continue to insist that this is n't so , and that they wo n't be going crying to the government any time soon , but the stock markets appear not to believe them .
And as Lloyds - HBOS and RBS shares slide , the chair of the Treasury select committee is demanding their full nationalisation .
If things continue as they are , the result may be a protracted and reluctant take - over of the entire UK banking system .
The government 's proposed new bank bail - out was received poorly by financial markets , probably because they know it does n't go anywhere near far enough .
Darling , like his new trans -Atlantic colleagues , is committed to buying up ' toxic securities ' to help the banks stay afloat as private entities .
Now , if we are going to pay for the banks ' losses , we should own them and as owners we should protect jobs , and ameliorate conditions for borrowers and home owners .
If the government is going to rehabilitate Keynesian demand - side economics , as it noisily announced in November , this would be a very moderate demand at the moment .
As it is , we have a situation where banks are being given big rate cuts by the Monetary Policy Committee , but are refusing ( with the exception of HSBC and Lloyds ) to pass it on to consumers .
True , the Chancellor has pledged that he wo n't let a single bank go down , but he has yet to be open about what this means .
Leaving these institutions under private control while accepting the liabilities means that the government budget has to effectively bear trillions of pounds in liabilities .
This could literally lead to the UK going bankrupt , Reykjavik - style The timidity of the Brown government is odd .
It ca n't be explained by its relationship to big business .
British capital is obviously divided over this , but when the Financial Times calls only half - jokingly for the government to shoot the bankers and nationalise the banks , it is obvious that a profound shift is taking place .
Nor can it be about the polls .
New Labour has never hesitated to impose unpopular policies , and it is right now implementing welfare cuts that are sure to further alienate its voting base .
The government 's proposed tax increase on higher income earners was popular , but it will raise little toward the costs now being racked up .
The Fabian - funded research suggests that most people would support much higher taxes on upper incomes - but polls have often found much stronger public support for wealth redistribution than exists in the parliamentary Labour Party .
My vague intuition is that , for all the bravado of the pre-Budget report , and for all the hints that Brown and Darling were dusting off the Keynesian texts , the government 's reflex position is decidedly neoliberal .
Neither the Labour Party , nor its parliamentary representatives , nor the cabinet , possesses a left - wing force substantial enough to force a different direction .
Moreover , I think that both the Blairites and the Brownites , for all the petty wrangling between them , are keen to avoid anything that encourages the Left .
Their psephological analysis continues to tell them that to win an election they must build an electoral coalition that includes pro-business , pro-family middle class voters in marginal constituencies , and they are determined to resist anything that looks like burying that New Labour project .
The political fall - out from this , even if we do n't go bankrupt , is potentially explosive .
Even on the overly optimistic assumptions of the government 's last pre-budget statement , the Treasury expects to slash public spending in a disastrous way by 2011 .
Now , with a new bail - out weighing heavily on the public purse , and more surely to be expected , the only way to balance the budget will be to have serious tax rises , and a sustained and vicious attack on public services and welfare far more extreme than anything we have seen so far .
Even before we get to that stage , millions of people are already being pushed to the edge by the job losses and pay cuts .
Partly because of the government 's weakness in the polls and the threat of a Tory government , most of the trade union bureaucracy is resistant to giving any expression to those grievances .
This appears to be what is happening with the Chemilines dispute , for example .
Moreover , the fear of losing a struggle in the current climate , where people are frightened of losing mortgages and so on , is likely to countervail against any tendencies toward militancy .
If that pessimism and lack of confidence prevailed , then the initial stimulus for any widespread revolt might well originate from outside the institutions of organised labour , in the form of mass protests and riots ( Reykjavik - style ) .
Such a combustion has the virtue of gaining momentum rapidly and giving people confidence , but it also has the disadvantage that , unless it feeds into union resistance and lays deep roots in society , it will lose that momentum just as quickly , and hit the earth with a crash .

The news Wednesday that Israeli warplanes bombed Palestinian supply tunnels running into the Gaza Strip again is more than a predictable hiccup in Israel 's self - declared cease - fire .
A Palestinian bomb had killed an Israeli soldier on Tuesday .
Israel responded with airstrikes the same day , and followed up Wednesday with air attacks on tunnels in the southern Gaza town of Rafah , on the Egyptian border .
There were no reported casualties , but residents fled their homes in panic .
The raid underlines - if any underlining was needed - that any lasting truce is going to hinge on the question of what is allowed into Gaza and how .
Since Israel stopped allowing much except humanitarian supplies into Gaza two years ago , in a bid to undermine the strip 's Hamas rulers , Gazans have depended on a warren of tunnels from Egypt for everything from AK - 47s to cheese .
If they could n't get even legit stuff in through the Israeli - controlled border points , Gaza 's merchants have been bringing it in underground .
And Hamas 's rocket builders have been bringing their weapons in that way , too .
The Israeli government 's effort to starve Hamas out seems to have failed ( partly because of the tunnels ) .
Its recent effort to bomb Hamas out ( and the tunnels ) does not appear to have been much more successful .
The Islamist party / army is bloodied but unbowed , and almost as soon as the guns fell quiet at the end of the recent war , Palestinians were digging again .
You can hardly expect Gazans to go on living only on smuggled goods , especially now that they have so much to rebuild .
Nor can you expect the Israelis to allow Hamas to resupply its rocket stocks .
If Israel wants international monitors to stop the tunnel traffic , the world is probably going to insist that Israel open its border crossings in return .
Study finds online porn may reduce the incidence of rape
Could online porn be responsible for a decrease in rape cases ?
A Clemson University study suggests it might .
Todd Kendall , an economics professor at Clemson University , published a study that found “ the arrival of the internet was associated with a reduction in rape incidence . ”
He notes that “ association ” is not causality , but he does point out that “ it is notable that growth in internet usage had no apparent effect on other crimes . ”
The rate of forcible rape in the past 15 years has declined 30 percent nationwide , according to Bob Dyer in a recent column on Ohio.com .
Meanwhile , he reports that “ never has pornography been more readily available . ”
Dyer attributes the decrease in rapes at least in part to the increased prevalence of porn .
Many people are n’t buying it .
When Dyer spoke to Karen Cimini , a psychologist at Akron Family Institute who specializes in sexual issues , she said that rape ” has more to do with control and power . ”
Using her theory , online porn would have little to do with a decrease in rape cases .
She told Dyer that the decline could be due to the fact that ” perhaps we ’re getting better at protecting ourselves . ”
According to the Rape , Abuse & Incest National Network ( RAINN ) , nearly one in six women and one in 33 men will be the victims of sexual abuse in their lifetimes .
RAINN reports that only six percent of rapists will ever spend a day in jail .
Wayne Westerman and John Elias are the two engineers who are responsible for much of Apple 's multi - touch technology found in the iPhone and notebook trackpads .
Westerman and Elias originally founded a company called Fingerworks in 1998 and developed a number of multi - touch input devices including keyboards and touch - pads .
Apple then acquired Fingerworks in 2005 and Westerman has been a senior engineer at Apple since .
Many of the multi - touch patents coming out of Apple have since credited Westerman as the lead inventor .
In a University of Delaware news article from October of 2008 , Westerman gives some rare comments about his inspiration when first designing these multi- touch interfaces .
Westerman had apparently suffered from a " stubborn bout " of tendonitis which was later relieved by the use of this touch - sensitive technology :
" I had an ergonomic problem and I paired it with a motivation , " Westerman said of the early inspiration .
" I 'd always felt that playing the piano was so much more graceful and expressive than using a computer keyboard , and I thought how great it would be if I pulled some of that expression from the piano to the computer experience . "
While Fingerworks ' input accessories did receive critical praise during their lifetime , they never achieved significant mainstream success before the acquisition .
Apple has been more cautious by slowly introducing multi- touch into their Macs .
At present , multi - touch technology is limited to notebook trackpads and the iPhone itself .
Apple , however , is continuing to hire more multi - touch engineers .
Their latest job listing is seeking a " Gesture Algorithms Engineer " -- a position that likely did n't exist even a year ago .
This potential hire would become part of the engineering team responsible for creating Apple 's " next - generation input devices and displays " .
Apple has been hiring Multi- Touch specialists for almost a year now , and previous patent applications show the possibilities of what could be accomplished with advanced gesture recognition .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
In a time of economic turmoil , most Americans are being frugal with their money , but one freshman congressman is taking cost - cutting to a new level .
Rep. Jason Chaffetz unfolds the cot that fits into a closet in his office .
Newly elected Rep. Jason Chaffetz , R - Utah , opted out of renting an apartment in Washington , instead deciding on a cot in his office every night .
" I will save $ 1,500 a month doing this , " Chaffetz said .
" I get paid a very handsome salary , no doubt about it , but you know , I 've got expenses and a future for my kids and my family , too . "
In a stroke of luck , Chaffetz was one of the few freshmen members of Congress to have the chance at an office with a window when he drew number six out of 55 in the office lottery .
His office in the Longworth House Building comes with a half - bathroom , a closet that fits a cot , and what he calls his " breakfast nook " where he stores Fig Newtons , granola bars and mixed nuts .
Watch more on the thrifty congressman »
The building also has a gym with a shower room , where Chaffetz starts his day about 5:45 each morning .
" My home is in Utah .
My wife and kids are there , " he said .
" I 'm here to work . "
Cutting out travel to and from the office allows Chaffetz more time to serve his constituents and return more of their e-mail and phone calls , he said .
The savings are certainly a plus for the congressman , who has three children to provide for , car payments and a mortgage to pay .
But Chaffetz said his decision had a larger meaning .
" We are now $ 10 trillion in debt .
$ 10 trillion .
Those are expenses that have to be paid at some point , " he said .
If he can tighten his belt in these tough economic times , Chaffetz said , Congress should be able to as well .
" Our country has to learn to do more with less , " he added .
Although he is a relatively unknown freshman in the House , word of Chaffetz 's sleeping arrangement is spreading .
Republican Rep. Judy Biggert of Illinois , whose office is adjacent to Chaffetz 's , said he is n't the first to sleep in his office , and he wo n't be the last .
" This is a job that you have to have , really , two homes .
One in your district where you 're there on the weekends and then one here during the week , and it's expensive , " Rep .
Biggert said .
" I 'm really glad we have a neighbor here to make sure that the neighborhood is safe at night when we 're not here , " she joked , adding that Chaffetz is actually projecting the right image of the Republican Party by being a " fiscal conservative . "
Chaffetz said he is finally getting used to sleeping on his not - so - comfortable cot , but that does n't mean he rests easy at night .
" My biggest challenge is what goes on in the hallway at night , " Chaffetz said .
" There 's this cleaning machine that comes down the hall at night .
And it 's got that obnoxious beep , beep , beep . "
Despite the din , Chaffetz has no plans to search for another form of housing -- unless his back gives out .
" I 've got to keep my back in check , but so far , so good , " Chaffetz joked .
" But look , our troops are sleeping on a lot worse than this . "

EDMONTON — Syncrude Canada faces charges from both Alberta and the federal governments in connection with the deaths of 500 ducks on one of the company ’s tailings ponds north of Fort McMurray last spring .
The provincial government laid charges under the Alberta Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act , accusing Syncrude of failing to have proper deterrents in place at the facility .
Environment Canada charged Syncrude under the federal Migratory Birds Convention
Act for one count of allegedly depositing or permitting the deposit of a substance harmful to migratory birds in waters or an area frequented by birds .
Alberta Environment Minister Rob Renner said Monday both charges will be dealt with during the same court hearing .
" I do n't know if circumstances such as this have ever happened , " Renner said .
" This is the first of its kind for charges to be laid in this manner in Alberta . "
Alberta Justice Minister Alison Redford said the investigation was a joint investigation between Alberta Environment and Environment Canada .
" This has been done hand in hand , " she said .
The maximum penalty for the provincial charge is a $ 500,000 fine , and the maximum on the federal charge on summary conviction is a fine of $ 300,000 or six months imprisonment , or both .
Redford said that if the province is successful in getting a conviction , it will be seeking an alternative penalty against Syncrude that involves " creative sentencing " around what the company may have to do in terms of technical development or environmental program work .
About 500 ducks landed on the Aurora mine tailings pond north of Fort McMurray on April 28 .
They became covered in oily residue floating on the surface and quickly sank to the bottom of the pond .
Only a handful of waterfowl were recovered .
The company said it delayed its normal deployment of scare cannons at the pond due to a late spring snowstorm .
The deaths caused an international uproar and critics said it gave Canada , and particularly Alberta , a black eye .
Environmentalists have branded oil from the oilsands “ dirty ” and lobbied governments to refuse to buy it or use it .
Renner said it was important to the credibility of the environmental regulatory system to lay charges in this widely publicized incident .
" I think we have an obligation to enforce our legislation , " he said .
" If we believe there has been an infraction committed under our legislation I think we have an obligation not only to the environment , but to the public and to the credibility of our system . "
Syncrude is not saying how they will plead to the charges .
“ It ’s really early in the process right now , so we ’re very much in review mode , ” said Alain Moore , a company spokesman .
“ We ’ll be looking at the charges , understanding the charges and how they apply .
And our legal team , after the analysis , are hoping to decide the appropriate path forward and that will be taking place over the next few weeks . ”
Meanwhile , the company is working on preventing a repeat incident .
“ The system had worked well for decades , but obviously last spring showed it did n’t work as well as intended , so changes had to be made .
Since then we ’ve had a thorough investigation to help understand what barriers we encountered and how we can help incorporate steps to prevent it from happening again .
We ’re in the process of finalizing those changes .
And we committed to our stakeholders to communicate those changes prior to spring migration and we ’ll be doing so . ”

The New " Black Gold " : Biofuel from Sewage
February 15th , 2009 by Tina Casey
We ’re already harvesting methane from sewage and spreading treated sewage solids on farms and open space , so it ’s not a stretch to imagine running our cars on biofuel from sewage , too .
Specifically , running our cars on sewage grease .
An enormous amount of grease enters our sewer systems – about 495 million gallons annually in the U.S. alone .
Most of it gets captured and collected at sewage treatment plants .
So what ’s stopping us – the ick factor aside – from siphoning off this readily available and potentially valuable biofuel feedstock ?
The Problem with Sewage Grease
Sewage grease – also known as trap grease – is a mutt .
Unlike yellow and brown greases , which come from used cooking oils , trap grease contains a bit of anything and everything you can find in a sewer .
That means waste grease and oil from home cooking and DIY projects , restaurants , schools , hospitals and institutions , business , and industry .
Bottom line :
The contaminants in trap grease , particularly sulfur , exceed ASTM standards for roadworthy fuel .
Sewage Grease Problem – Solved ?
With scores of alternative fuel companies dotting the landscape , it was only a matter of time before someone solved the contaminant conundrum .
BioFuelBox Corp. is one company that recently announced a modification in its process for refining waste grease from sewage , to achieve a product that meets ASTM standards – including standards for sulfur .
Beyond Sewage Grease and Biofuel
Recycling sewage grease into biofuel dovetails neatly with at least one fundamental aspect of sustainability , the zero waste society .
On - site waste recovery and recycling is another aspect of the BioFuelBox model that fits into the overall picture .
The BioFuelBox refineries are mobile , scaleable units suitable for land - strapped areas and wide open space alike .
They can be deployed relatively quickly where needed , providing the kind of site - specific flexibility that large centralized refineries do n’t have .
The BioFuelBox model also stands to reduce costs and emissions associated with infrastructure maintenance .
By converting waste into a usable or marketable product it provides a direct financial incentive to capture more grease on - site , before it enters the sewer system and clogs up the arteries .
Sewage grease carries none of the carbon footprint baggage related to growing crops for biofuel feedstock .
In particular , it skirts the ugly pricing and supply issues that can ( and have ) arisen when a program of using food crops for biofuel is poorly planned and executed .
With biofuel from sewage grease , let ’s chalk up another score for our sewers .
Would n’t want to live in them , but increasingly , ca n’t live without them .

..... # 4 – Caravan - Woodland [ Spring ----]
________________________________________
________________________________________
___________
...................
...................
A few years ago , in dense woodland a few miles from my home , I discovered a caravan .
Encircled by trees and undergrowth , and over a mile from the nearest road , its presence was utterly incongruous , with few clues as to how or why it had come to rest at this point .
For almost a year , I kept my distance , fearful it was inhabited by a hermit and that I would be chased away if I ventured too close .
Eventually , I investigated further and discovered that it was empty ; its furnishings intact , but no sign of human inhabitants .
Sadly , the door was locked , and so I gave it little thought for several months .
...................
...................
...................
...................
...................
...................
As I became more adept at gaining entry to places ( hospitals , houses , building sites ) my sense of the possible changed ; and I finally found a way inside last summer .
Expecting damp and buckled floors , perhaps even a makeshift aviary , I was shocked by how habitable the caravan still seemed .
The floors and worktops were littered with mouse droppings , but it was otherwise in remarkable condition .
Cushions veiled with a fine layer of dust , the carpet faded yet coarse , it was only upon closer inspection of the veneers and window frames that any real damage was evident .
...................
...................
...................
...................
...................
...................
...................
...................
The only objects on display were a fire extinguisher and a box of matches , and so I quickly started opening drawers and cupboards in the hope of finding something more personal .
Though the majority were empty , I still unearthed several clues about the final inhabitant : a charcoal jacket ( pockets full of nails ) , a pair of boots and , most interestingly of all , a diary from 1989 ( unused , but it at least revealed how long the caravan had lain empty ) .
...................
...................
...................
...................
...................
...................
...................
...................
Throughout that summer I would often return to the forest , and would invariably spend an hour or two cocooned inside the caravan .
Despite setting out with the high - minded intention to read or to write , I would usually just sit there ( gazing out across woodland or listening to the spiral songs of linnets , cuckoos and skylarks ) .
...................
...................
...................
...................
[ A particularly pleasant side - effect of the moss - covered windows was the lambent light it would cast across the desk ( lightshafts streaming through the canopy and then filtered through years ’ worth of accreted dirt and grime ) ... ]
...................
...................
Somehow my plan to spend a night there – or to seek shelter during a storm ( the roof spittooned with hailstones ) – never came to anything , and as summer drew to a close I returned to university .
...................
...................
...................
...................
I returned home for a week in November – quickly settling into a pattern of two or three extended walks each day ..
( answering to a need for more varied terrain after the planar drudge of ___________ ) .
On my final day , without any forethought or planning , I suddenly found myself in the vicinity of the caravan , and so decided to check on its condition ( mindful of falling trees or the owner ’s return ) .
...................
...................
...................
...................
...................
...................
...................
...................
...................
...................
In the months since my last visit , the wood had become increasingly overgrown , and was now almost impossible to traverse – the few remaining pathways consumed by brambles , hawthorns and nettles .
After much crawling and stamping , I finally found a way through ( emerging covered in cobwebs , burrs , lacerations .. ) – and was confronted by the sight of a broken window , and the door swinging on its hinges .
...................
...................
Peering inside , there was no obvious damage , though I was startled to see a piece of paper , weighted down with a pencil , on top of the writing desk .
On a page torn from the diary , someone had written :
They call this “ Sanctuary Wood ” – for me it fulfils a dream .
I ’m sorry I trespass but if I had my dream somewhere like this would be my home and sanctuary .
...................
...................
...................
...................
...................
...................
In the past , trampled bracken has led me to suspect other visitors ; but given the caravan ’s location , I ’d simply assumed it was the landowner .
The idea of another interloper initially caused much unease ( even flickers of resentment ) as I briefly imagined an ever - increasing flow of visitors and vandalism ( as at Cane Hill or Severalls ) .
...................
...................
I soon regained perspective , however , and realised how magical it was that we should both have found this place ( and that this person should feel compelled to commit something to paper ) .
In response I wrote of my own attachment to the caravan ( lamenting the damage to the window ) and asked this person who they were ( disclosing something of myself in turn ) .
At the end of my reply , I added that I ’d be returning before Christmas , and hoped very much that they ’d write back .
...................
...................
...................
...................
And now it ’s December , and I am in W----- again .
On our third day here , I set out for the caravan – noticing , as I approached , that the window was covered in plastic and that the diary now lay open on the writing desk :
...................
...................
--/--/--
I can remember this place years ago .
There used to be sheep , then I lost touch with the area .
Do n’t know who broke the window but yes it is a great shame .
Maybe someone could n’t pick the lock .
Hope you still work here .
I just sit in peace .
...................
...................
-/--/--
Been coming here for years .
Lost my way for a while .
I used to fish in the pond when I was younger .
Do n’t know where they [ the people ] all went but in a selfish way I am glad .
I ’m a support time recovery worker .
Know what you mean about this place and comfort .
Put a bit of poly at the window .
Wish I could escape everyday – only weekends for me .
Happy to meet another refugee from the world .
--/--/--
I do n’t know who owns the land but I think it was divided .
There used to be sheep up this end .
...................
...................
--/--/--
Had a quick visit – dark , damp , safe .
It looks like you will have this haven to yourself .
This town is looking a bit expensive for this old boy .
Looks like it ’s time to move on .
Couple of deer and plenty of pheasants for company .
Hope plastic stays in place , keep a bit of rain out .
Enjoy – will soon be Christmas .
...................
...................
--/--/--
Quick walk over – stressed .
Unless you walk over the field , looks like someone else visits .
Window has held ?
Good job too .
Hope you enjoy Christmas and the New Year brings all you want .
Do n’t know , but if I win the lottery think I might buy a wood – one with a small green caravan in it .

A doctor exams mammogram x-rays in a file photo .
REUTERS / Eric Gaillard
HONG KONG ( Reuters ) - Scientists in Japan have identified an enzyme which appears to suppress breast cancer and they hope the finding will spur new therapies to control the second most common cancer in the world .
At issue is the enzyme CHIP , which experts say can stunt cancer growth by degrading a number of cancer - causing proteins .
The enzyme occurs naturally in human breast tissue .
In an article published in Nature Cell Biology , the scientists said they injected two kinds of human breast cancer cells into mice .
One set carried the CHIP enzyme and the other was without the chemical .
Tumors in the first group of mice with the CHIP enzyme were far smaller than the one without the enzyme , Junn Yanagisawa at the University of Tsukuba ’s Graduate School of Life and Environmental Sciences in Japan told Reuters .
The same results were seen in a parallel experiment using a more aggressive line of human breast cancer cells , he added .
“ Our conclusion is that we have found that CHIP protein prevents breast tumor growth and metastasis , ” Yanagisawa said .
Metastasis occurs when cancer spreads from its site of origin , which challenges therapy and may even result in death .
“ In breast tumor treatments , measurement of the CHIP protein levels in the tumors may be valuable information for the treatment .

Tipo 60 ' Birdcage '
Christie's to offer Million Pound Maserati for sale this Spring
At the sale of Exceptional Motor Cars and Memorabilia at the Jack Barclay Showroom , London on the evening of the 26th March 2001 , the ex-Odoardo Govoni Maserati Tipo 60 shown below was sold to an anonymous telephone bidder for GB £ 1,300,000 plus GB £ 100,000 buyer 's premium .
That 's around US $ 2,000,000 .
It 's alright for some !
Bidding started at £ 600,000 and with bids coming from several sources , rose gradually to £ 1,000,000 .
From this point it became a contest between an unknown bidder in the sale room and another bidder on the telephone .
The bids then increased at £ 100,000 a time until one happy ' Maseratista ' forked out the princely sum of £ 1,300,000 .
My sincere thanks to Patricia Clark of Christie 's for allowing me to publish the ' Press Release ' for the sale of this historically important Maserati for your information .

1960 MASERATI TIPO 60 BIRDCAGE 2 - SEATER SPORTS RACING CAR
Exceptional Motor Cars and Automobilia - 26th March 2001
LONDON - Christie's is delighted to announce the sale of the 1960 Maserati Birdcage 2 - Seater Sports - Racing Car .
Owned by a private collector for 35 years , this curvaceous Italian ' racing red ' machine is a unique first production model and has never been restored .
Estimated to realize between £ 800,000 and £ 1,200,000 , the car will be offered for sale in the sale of Exceptional Motor Cars and Memorabilia on the 26th March 2001 at the Jack Barclay Showroom , Ponton Road , London .
A BRIEF HISTORY - From their grand - prix debut in 1925 , Maserati was synonomous with functional style and effective performance .
But in 1957 , despite conitinual successes , the company was in financial difficulty from running full works - supported teams in all categories of international events .
These were disbanded at the end of the season and most cars were sold off .
Maserati concentrated on their road - going cars for two years , widening the model ranges and generating growth .
Then , in mid-1959 , they began to develop a new sports - racing car .
This time there would be no official works team : the cars would be sold directly to the public , with technical support and back - up for private entrants .
This way , advertising based on any racing success would boost road - going sales .
New technology conceived by chief engineer Giulio Alfieri , produced an incredibly light framework .
The complex design of cross - braced , steel micro-tubing created a complex chassis and body - frame combined .
The nickname Maserati ' birdcage ' quickly spread around the world .
This innovative design , which incorporated the engine being fitted intricately into the chassis and canted over at an angle of 45 degrees , gave rise to the remarkably low - slung but beautifully curvaceous bodywork .
The new engine based on the earlier 200S unit , of 2 - litre capacity , dry - sumped , fitted with twin side - draught Weber 45DCO / 3 carburettors and dual ignition , produced a good performance with plenty of low down torque , and the ultra lightwiight construction chassis probved highly successful .
Odoardo Govoni heading to victory in the Coppa D'Oro , Modena - 16th October 1960
Stirling Moss , Maserati's former team driver , carried out some early testing of the prototype , and was most enthusiastic .
Further test driving was done by Odoardo Govoni , who had won the coveted European Hill - Climb Championship in 1956 in a Maserati A6GCS .
Entrusted with the factory prototype T60 for the final round in the 1959 series , at the famous Pontedecimo - Giovi event , he scored a notable first victory for the type and promptly ordered the first production car as soon as it would be ready .
According to the factory documentation , Odoardo Govoni took delivery of chassis no .
2460 on the 13th May 1960 .
From 1960 - 1963
Govoni campaigned this car extensively in Northern Italian events , primarily hill - climbs on closed roads and occasional track races .
His effectiveness was such that he was crowned Italian Champion twice and was runner - up twice in four years , in this very competetive 2 - litre classification .
In 1963 , he sold the car to a Signor Terra and it was purchased by the current owner in 1966 .

at the Coppa D'Oro , Modena - 16th October 1960
This astonishing machine has been cherished and has remained complete and original in its condition as last raced in 1964 .
It is unique example of the rare T60 , being the first full - production car .
It has never been out of Italy , it has never been restored and it is as near possible just as it left the factory .
It shows every element of graceful ageing , including cracked old paintwork , dents to the bodywork , old running repairs and minor modifications made to suit the drivers during its remarkable racing career .
It remains in running condition even today , 35 years on , and in recent years has occasionally been driven along the banks of the Tiber , much to the pleasure of the local residents .
The news about the partnership between LEGO and Disney has us all very excited here at GeekDad .
So far they 've only announced sets based on Toy Story , Cars , and the as - yet - unreleased Prince of Persia movie .
But we can't help thinking of all the sets we'd like to see in the years to come based on other Disney - owned properties .
I 've made my own personal top ten list , here considering only those ones that I could actually believe they 'd consider making ( because lots of movies that Disney owns are too obscure to be reasonable as sources for marketable LEGO sets ) .
Here , then , is my list , counting down :
__
10 . Timon and Pumbaa 's Jungle ( from The Lion King ) __- I do n't really know how to make a good - looking LEGO jungle , but then that 's why I 'm not a Master Builder .
I would love to see this , and I 'll bet it'd be a hit with lots of kids ( of all ages ) .
Plus , I really want to see what a LEGO meerkat and warthog look like .
9 . The Hundred Acre Wood ( from the Winnie - the - Pooh movies ) - While I 've always preferred the original Milne stories ( and Shepard illustrations ) to the Disney versions , I would love to see what LEGO could do with the setting .
I can just see Pooh 's house , with its sign reading ( on a sticker , of course ) " Mr. Sanders . "
And just the idea of a Pooh minifig is enough to make me smile .
8. WALL - E's ( Truck ) Home ( from WALL-E , obviously ) - I thought WALL - E was a flawed and unsubtle movie , but in many ways brilliant .
One of the things I loved about it was the attention to detail shown in every scene , which is easily illustrated by the old truck that WALL - E calls home .
I know that a LEGO set of it could n't render every little object that WALL - E collects , but I have confidence in the set creators ' ability to capture the spirit that the filmmakers put in the scenes there .
7. The Insect City ( from A Bug 's Life ) - Here 's a chance for the LEGO Master Builders to really shine , because instead of scaling large things way down as usual they'd be scaling small things up .
Remember all the boxes and cans and other trash that made up the bustling city Flik went to looking for help ?
Now picture a LEGO
version .
It would n't be easy , but it could be really awesome .
6 . The Sultan 's Palace ( from Aladdin ) - I was going to go with the Cave of Wonders , but after thinking about it decided that the palace would simply be a more interesting and colorful set .
Obviously doing the whole palace would be an enormous ( and consequently expensive ) set , so probably this would have to be scaled down to just the throne room and maybe Jafar 's secret underground lair .
And I can picture minifigs of Jafar , the Sultan , Jasmine , and Aladdin ( with changeable torso so he can be Prince Ali , too ) .
I 'm not sure how they 'd deal with Iago and Rajah ( the tiger ) , but I know they 'd figure out a way .
5 . The Imperial City ( from Mulan ) - I do n't know how they'd do this , but it 's so beautiful in the movie I would love to see it recreated in LEGO bricks .
Maybe it would be best split into a couple of different sets , or they could concentrate just on the Emperor 's palace .
Either way , I know I 'd pay for it .
__4 . Syndrome 's Island Base ( from The Incredibles ) - I still think The Incredibles is the best Pixar movie thus far , and Syndrome 's base is far and away the best subject in the film for a LEGO set .
There are cool traps around every corner , interesting structures , and potential for at least five minifigs ( the four Incredibles and
Syndrome , of course ) .
I can see my kids having tons of fun playing with it , recreating the scenes where Elastigirl , Violet , and Dash try to get into the base to rescue Mr. Incredible .
__
3. Spaceship Earth ( from Epcot at Walt Disney World ) - Since
I see no reason to confine the sets only to fictional places , why not one based on this amazing geodesic sphere and the ride it contains ?
Making the sphere out of LEGO bricks would be challenging , I 'm sure , but satisfying and really neat to look at .
They'd have to come up with a mechanism to allow you to open the sphere , to see the ride inside , or maybe just make the set contain only half the sphere so it remains open constantly .
I leave such decisions up to the minds at LEGO , but I think this would make an awesome set .
2. The Black Pearl ( from the Pirates of the Caribbean movies ) - Yeah , I know LEGO already has a Pirates line that has no relationship to the movies , but maybe they could have a crossover set .
These movies are easily the most popular live - action Disney films of the last decade , and the Black Pearl would certainly be the biggest seller of any set they could make based on them .
I know I 'd buy it in a heartbeat , even though I thought the second and third movies were just
OK , and even though the films combined to convince me that Orlando
Bloom could n't act his way out of a paper bag .
1. The Beast 's Castle ( from Beauty and the Beast ) - This is the one I want to see the most , as I said on the GeekDads podcast earlier this week .
There are so many neat rooms , so much richness of story and character in each one , this has the potential for a masterpiece of LEGO set design .
It would be really big , to be sure , even if large areas like the ballroom were scaled down disproportionately .
But just think of how amazing it would look , and how much fun it would be to build it !
This one would be expensive , but so very much worth the money .
So that 's my list .
Of course , there are more movies coming out later this year , like the Pixar film UP ( which looks like a lot of fun ) and The Princess and the Frog , Disney 's return to pure 2D animation , so my list might be different a year from now .
And I know that if I 'd asked my kids for help with the list , there would 've been a High School Musical entry somewhere .
I 'm sure everyone 's list is different ; please leave a comment about yours .

Harunian omission
Given that the entire message of the book depends upon the alleged resemblance between modern animals and their fossil counterparts , I was amused , when I began flicking through at random , to find page 468 devoted to " eels " , one fossil and one modern .
The caption says ,
There are more than 400 species of eels in the order Anguilliformes .
That they have not undergone any change in millions of years once again reveals the invalidity of the theory of evolution .
The fossil eel shown may well be an eel , I can not tell .
But the modern " eel " that Yahya pictures ( see left ) is undoubtedly not an eel but a sea snake , probably of the highly venomous genus Laticauda ( an eel is , of course , not a snake at all but a teleost fish ) .
I have not scanned the book for other inaccuracies of this kind .
But given that this was almost the first page I looked at . . . what price the main thesis of the book that modern animals are unchanged since the time of their fossil counterparts ?
To my surprise , I received
a
comment that Dawkins should be more honest about his criticism , as t
he picture that Dawkin
s is referring to is simply not in the Atlas of Creation
Atlas of Creation from Yahya's website and sure enough I did not see the picture of sea snake under the section of eels .
Was Dawkins lying ?
How sleazy of him to make false assertions about an honest revolutionary like Harun Yahya .
What better can you expect from an atheist like Dawkins ?
Of course , with my mistrust of Dawkins at all time high , I wanted to double - check with the physical Atlas of Creation - that I happen to have ( courtesy of UMass - anthropology ) .

I immediately downloaded thefrom Yahya's website and sure enough I did not see the picture of sea snake under the section of eels .

Of course , with my mistrust of Dawkins at all time high , I wanted to double - check with the physical - that I happen to have ( courtesy of Laurie Godfrey of ) .
To my
surprise , I found Dawkins ' sea snake prominently displayed as Dawkins had claimed ( see the picture below ) .
Now I know that Harun Yahya - the author of hundreds of pamphlet - like books - cannot possibly be wrong .
I am left with only one possible conclusion : this must be Harunian omission at work !!
It almost feels like a miracle .
Harunian omission at work : ( left ) Sea - snake included as an eel in the print version of Atlas of Creation ( p 468 ) .
After Dawkins pointed out the obvious , the electronic version ( right ) replaced the snake with an eel .
Now some people think that Dawkins was lying .
Instead , it is the miracle of Harunian Omission .
Atlas of Creation
Finally , PZ has already called attention to this on Pharyngula , but I include a picture for completeness .
On page 244 , Yahya wishes to say that caddis flies have not changed since some 25 - million - year - old insects preserved in amber .
Once again , the caption :
These living things have survived for millions of years without the slightest change in their structures .
The fact that these insects never changed is a sign that they never evolved .
By now , we have come to expect something pretty good when we look at the photograph of the modern animal .
What will the modern ' caddis fly ' be ?
A minnow , perhaps ?
A garden slug ?
A king prawn ?
No , in a way is better than any of these : A fishing lure , complete with prominent steel hook !
The picture above shows a metal hook under the fly .

Hugo Chavez has warmly welcomed Mr Medvedev to Venezuela
Russia and Venezuela have signed an agreement to promote the development of nuclear energy for civilian use .
The agreement was signed during a visit by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to Venezuela 's capital , Caracas , on the latest leg of his Latin American tour .
Under the accord , Russia would help Venezuela build a nuclear energy plant .
Joint gas projects were also approved .
Military co-operation is also high on the agenda of Mr Medvedev 's talks with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez .
Russian and Venezuelan warships are scheduled to hold joint military exercises later this week .
The Russian vessels , including the flagship missile cruiser Peter the Great and two support vessels , appeared off La Guaira , near Caracas , early on Tuesday .
The destroyer Admiral Chabanenko docked while Venezuelan forces fired a 21 - gun salute .
This is first Russian deployment of its kind in the Caribbean since the end of the Cold War .
New alignments
Russia is already a major arms supplier to Venezuela , with contracts worth some $ 4.4bn ( £ 2.39bn ) .
Mr Medvedev 's visit is part of a Latin American tour aimed at boosting both Russia 's presence and trade ties in a region traditionally of strategic importance to the US .
Venezuela and Russia have increased energy co-operation
BBC diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus says the Russian president 's aim is to show Washington , where President - elect Barack Obama is preparing for office , that if the US does things in Europe near Russia 's borders which Moscow does not like , then Russia can pursue its own policies in a region long seen by Washington as its backyard .
Boosting bilateral trade between Russia and Latin America , which could reach $ 15 bn ( £ 9.9bn ) this year , is another priority for the Russian president during his talks .
The Russian leader travelled to Venezuela from Brazil , where he and President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva held talks on boosting trade and technical co-operation .
In Rio de Janeiro , the two presidents expressed their view that the " Bric " countries - Brazil , Russia , India and China - should hold their first summit in Russia in 2009 .
Mr Medvedev 's visit takes place just a few days after the Chinese president , Hu Jintao , toured several Latin American nations with a view to strengthening ties .

A limited number of posters with the image will also be distributed as gifts to grassroots donors for small contributions .
Up to 800 students marched through central London on Wednesday to campaign for free education and to send a message to the government that privatisation will not be tolerated .
The march gathered to hear a short rally at Soas campus , the site of the first occupation over Gaza which kick started a wave of student protest .
The spirit of the occupation movement was well represented on the demonstration .
Kate from Soas told Socialist Worker , “ It ’s great to see so many people here at Soas .
I really feel like a movement has begun that can start to tackle anything we come up against . ”
Students came from all over Britain to attend the demonstration with coaches from Leeds , Sussex and Birmingham all converging on London .
Speaking at the opening rally , Mark Bergfeld from Essex University told the crowd , “ We have a saying in Germany that 400 students in a road can bring traffic to a standstill , but 400 truck drivers can bring a whole country to a stop .
“ We have to join together with workers in our struggle and change society together . ”
He was met with massive cheers and applause .
The march stopped outside the headquarters of the national body of Vice Chancellors – Universities UK .
Chants of “ Shame on you ” came through the crowd as students expressed anger at the privatisation on campuses .
There was a strong anti-capitalist message on the protest , as students linked the current economic crisis to privatisation and imperialism .
This can be the start of a vibrant campaign for students in a renewed fight for free education and regaining control of our universities .
A team of scientists , speaking today at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science , called for new awareness of the potential for antibiotic - resistant illnesses from the marine environment , and pointed to the marine realm as a source for possible cures of those threats .
The group stated that newly completed studies of ocean beach users point to an increasing risk of staph infections , and that current treatments for seafood poisoning may be less effective due to higher than expected antibiotic resistance .
The group also asserts that new research has identified sponge and coral - derived chemicals with the potential for breaking down antibiotic resistant compounds and that could lead to new personalized medical treatments .
" While the marine environment can indeed be hostile to humans , it may also provide new resources to help reduce our risks from illnesses such as those caused by water borne staph or seafood poisoning , " stated Paul Sandifer , Ph.D. , former member of the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy , chief scientist of NOAA 's Oceans and Human Health Initiative , and co-organizer of the symposium .
Carolyn Sotka , also with the NOAA Oceans and Human Health Initiative and lead organizer of the session , stated " It is critically important that we continue research on the complex interactions between the condition of our oceans and human health .
Without doubt , this research will develop new understandings of ocean health risks and perhaps more importantly crucial discoveries that will lead to new solutions to looming public health problems . "
Coral , Sponges Point To Personalized Medicine Potential
" We 've found significant new tools to fight the antibiotic resistance war , " says NOAA research scientist Peter Moeller , Ph.D. , in describing the identification of new compounds derived from a sea sponge and corals .
" The first hit originates with new compounds that remove the shield bacteria utilize to protect themselves from antibiotics .
The second hit is the discovery of novel antibiotics derived from marine organisms such as corals , sponges and marine microbes that fight even some of the worst infectious bacterial strains .
With the variety of chemicals we find in the sea and their highly specific activities , medicines in the near future can be customized to individuals ' needs , rather than relying on broad spectrum antibiotics . "
The research team , a collaboration between scientists at NOAA 's Hollings Marine Laboratory in Charleston , S.C. , the Medical University of South Carolina and researchers at North Carolina State University in Raleigh , N.C. , noticed a sponge that seemed to thrive despite being located in the midst of a dying coral reef .
After extraction , testing showed that one of the isolated chemicals , algeliferin , breaks down a biofilm barrier that bacteria use to protect themselves from threats including antibiotics .
The same chemical can also disrupt or inhibit formation of biofilm on a variety of bacteria previously resistant to antibiotics which could lead to both palliative and curative response treatment depending on the problem being addressed .
" This could lead to a new class of helper drugs and result in a rebirth for antibiotics no longer thought effective , " notes Moeller .
" Its potential application to prevent biofilm build - up in stents , intravenous lines and other medical uses is incredible . "
The compound is currently being tested for a variety of medical uses and has gone through a second round of sophisticated toxicity screening and thus far shows no toxic effects .
Staph : A Beach Going Concern
Research , funded by multiple agencies and conducted by the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences and the Leonard M. Miller School of Medicine , found that swimmers using public ocean beaches increase their risk for exposure to staph organisms , and they may increase their risk for potential staph infections once they enter the water .
" Our study found that if you swim in subtropical marine waters , you have a significant chance , approximately 37 percent , of being exposed to staph — either yours or possibly that from someone else in the water with you , " said Dr. Lisa Plano , a pediatrician and microbiologist with the Miller School of Medicine .
Plano collaborated in the first large epidemiologic survey of beach users in recreational marine waters without a sewage source of pollution .
" This exposure might lead to colonization or infection by water - borne bacteria which are shed from every person who enters the water .
People who have open wounds or are immune - compromised are at greatest risk of infection . "
The Miami research team does not advise avoiding beaches , but recommends that beach - goers take precautions to reduce risk by showering thoroughly before entering the water and after getting out .
They also point out that while antibiotic resistant staph , commonly known as MRSA , has been increasingly found in diverse environments , including the marine environment , less than three percent of staph isolated from beach waters in their study was of the potentially virulent MRSA variety .
More research is needed to understand how long staph ( including MRSA ) can live in coastal waters , and human uptake and infection rates associated with beach exposures .
Antibiotic Resistance in Seafood - borne Pathogens Increasing
Researchers at the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Science in West Boothbay Harbor , Maine , report that the frequency of antibiotic resistance in vibrio bacteria was significantly higher than expected .
These findings suggest that the current treatment of vibirio infections should be re-examined , since these microbes are the leading cause of seafood - borne illness and death in the United States .
The severity of these infections makes antibiotic resistance in vibrios a critical public health concern .
Naturally - occurring resistance to antibiotics among Vibrios may undermine the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment , but as yet this has not been extensively studied .
Furthermore , antibiotics and other toxicants discharged into the waste stream by humans may increase the frequency of antibiotic - resistant Vibrio strains in contaminated coastal environments .
" We found resistance to all major classes of antibiotics routinely used to treat Vibrio infections , including aminoglycosides , tetracyclines , and cephalosporins , " stated Bigelow 's Ramunas Stepanauskas , Ph.D. " In contrast , we found that Vibrios were highly susceptible to carbapenems and new - generation fluoroquinolones , such as Imipenem and Ciprofloxacin .
This information may be used to design better strategies to treat Vibrio infections . "

Okay , here we go again , another WWII FPS .
Shooting Nazis , running through bombed - out European towns and planting the American flag to the sound of soaring instrumental music .
But there 's a twist :
You wo n't win if you run and gun , you do n't storm Normandy Beach , you 've got to utilize fairly smart AI teammates , and for once I enjoyed just about every minute of it .
Brothers in Arms : Hell 's Highway makes it clear from the start that you are meant to work in teams .
Combat revolves around suppressing and flanking , and even in the early missions you 'll eat lead if you are n't playing the way the designers want you to .
If you stick with it , you 'll settle into a nice groove : Spot an enemy platoon , set up one team behind cover to suppress the baddies , then leapfrog your teams toward the enemy until they are close enough to be killed with grenades .
Alternatively , you can have multiple teams suppress the same enemy while you sneak around and kill them all yourself , but this can backfire , as often once one group of Nazis are killed another team spawns on top of where they were .
You can also use your own grenades to flush Nazis from cover and there are few things more satisfying than watching a bunch of them run screaming their girlish German screams only to get shot up by your heavy gunner team .
There are literally hundreds of Nazis hiding in this idyllic village .
What 's so cool about this system to me is that your AI teammates do a very convincing job most of the time of acting like smart , but obedient partners .
They shout at you to get behind cover if you are careless , they relay orders from you to each other , and once dug in behind solid cover they wo n't get themselves killed if you stop watching over them .
In many ways this game operates more like a puzzle game than an FPS .
You can think of your teams as pieces on a board that need to be moved to the right places and under the correct circumstances , with the solution always being to surmount an enemy position .
Your teams , whether machine gunners or bazookas , never run out of ammo and if some or all get killed , will magically respawn once you 've reached a checkpoint , so you do n't have to be too anal about protecting them .
Your own character can pick up guns along the way but you 're given so much ammo that it almost never matters .
One less thing to stress about as you 're taking down the Hun .
Things are n't all perfect of course .
Pathfinding could be better .
Every so often , your team will decide to take cover on the wrong side of a barrier and get absolutely shredded .
Please just stay behind the conveniently - placed corrugated metal barrier .
The suppression system does n't work both ways .
The enemy can't pin you or your team down .
In fact , your team can be getting shot at with mortars and still run straight toward certain death if you tell them too .
Enemies never try to overrun you when you and your team are dug in or even throw grenades .
This really limits the challenge and a lot of fights degenerate into a kind of whack - a- mole contest with you waiting for an enemy to pop up from cover so you can kill him .
This in particular is a real shame because allowing the enemies to outflank you would have intensified the combat and added a lot of pressure , similar to how sitting around in Gears of War will quickly get you killed .
" You know , despite the heat of battle , I think we could just stay here together forever . "
Although your team does a fine job pinning the enemy down , it seems the game designers really wanted you to do the dirty work of actually killing the enemies .
Sure your bazooka team sometimes takes a few out in a blast , but more often than not it is just you and your M1 Garand laying them down .
Two more dead Nazis , comin ' right up ...
Did I mention all the Nazi troops scream like little girls ?
It 's as if the Germans ran out of soldiers and had to turn to the Hitler Youth to make ends meet .
After the next commit I will make in Distutils ( that adds tests for bdist_rpm ) , the test coverage of this Python standard library package will be at 41 % .
This means that I have doubled the test coverage over the past few months , from 18 % to 41 % .
My goal is to double it again , and reach 80 % in the next 6 months .
This also means I am just half an idiot now !
( since people who do n’t have 100 % code coverage are idiots ; ) ) .
So does it make Distutils more robust ?
It would have probably made the latest Python 3 release looks better for this package , since we had a uncovered cmp ( ) call left in Distutils by the time the release was made .
In the meantime , as I said before , the “ real ” Distutils regression test suite is held by all the packages out there in the community , that are built and installed everyday .

Yes .
Jesus is the foundation of our faith .
In fact , we prefer to call our Church by its full name , The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints .
The Book of Mormon says , “ And we talk of Christ , we rejoice in Christ , we preach of Christ , we prophesy of Christ , and we write according to our prophecies , that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins ” ( 2 Nephi 25:26 ) .

Mr. Obama has repeatedly said he wants to close the camp .
But in an interview on Sunday on ABC , he indicated that the process could take time , saying , “ It is more difficult than I think a lot of people realize . ”
Closing it within the first 100 days of his administration , he said , would be “ a challenge . ”
The president - elect drew criticism from some human rights groups Monday who said his remarks suggested that closing Guantánamo was not among the new administration ’s highest priorities .
But even if the detention camp remains open for months , the decision to address Guantánamo on the day after his inauguration seemed intended to make a symbolic break with some of the most controversial policies of the Bush administration .
Several national security and legal analysts have argued in recent weeks that Mr. Obama is in a delicate political position after having committed himself to closing the prison .
Sarah Mendelson , the author of a report for the Center for Strategic and International Studies on how to close the prison , said Mr. Obama ’s remarks on Sunday appeared intended to indicate the difficulty of the task , which she said it could take a year to complete .
“ I thought he was trying to manage expectations of how quickly those detainees who remain can be sorted into two categories : those who will be released and those who will be prosecuted , ” Ms. Mendelson said .
Aside from analyzing intelligence and legal filings on each of the remaining detainees , diplomats and legal experts have said the new administration will need to begin an extensive new international effort to resettle as many as 150 or more of the remaining men .
Portugal and other European countries have recently broken a long diplomatic standoff , saying they would work with the new administration and might accept some detainees who cannot be sent to their home countries because of concerns about their potential treatment .
Franken probable winner of hotly contested Minn. race Andrew McLemore
Published : Saturday January 3 , 2009
Print This Email This Democrat Al Franken appears to have gained a winning lead in his hotly contested race with Republican incumbent Norm Coleman over a Minnesota senate seat .
Franken holds an unofficial lead of 226 votes as state officials counted previously rejected absentee ballots in St. Paul , according to a newspaper tally .
There were more than 900 in the pile that were counted Saturday .
As Coleman 's term as a US Senator ended at noon Washington time on Saturday , the new figures are bad news for the GOP senator .
But though the recount has been completed , the final decision may rest with the Minnesota Supreme Court , which is still considering a request from Coleman 's campaign to add more absentee ballots to be reconsidered , effectively altering the traditional process of a recount .
Coleman 's campaign objected to Saturday 's recount before it began .
Attorney Tony Trimble demanded the counting wait until the state Supreme Court made a decision on its request to add hundreds of additional ballots to the mix .
" We feel you are proceeding in a very inconsistent and unconstitutional manner , " Trimble told representatives of the secretary of state 's office .
Coleman said there is little doubt the outcome of the election will be challenged if he is on the losing end .
The GOP has also said it will block any attempt by Democrats to seat Franken .

I always wondered why luxury magazines are filled with so many models looking bored out of their skulls .
You know the look -- the vacant stare on the Polo equestrienne , the skyward gaze of the Calvin underwear model , the group of partying Prada models looking at everything but each other .

Now we may have an explanation .
The rich , it turns out , do n't like eye contact .
According to a study on eye contact and the wealthy done by researchers at the University of California - Berkeley and published in the Journal of Psychological Science , " individuals of higher socioeconomic status were prone to fidgeting , not making eye contact ... doodling and examining their nails , while individuals of lower socio- economic status were highly attentive , nodded or laughed when appropriate , and maintained eye contact . "
The study concludes that nonverbal cues can signal wealth - - or lack thereof -- to others , just as effectively as the clothing they wear or the cars they drive .
There is a danger in having power .
Credit at least many decades ago was seen almost as an extension of the morality of the borrower .
That is , the way credit was given many times reflected the capacity , collateral , and character of the borrower .
Main Street is already feeling this recession like the worst since World War II and credit is tight for most average Americans just like it was back then .
In this recent bubble , all 3 historical credit factors were disregarded .
Capacity was never examined in many cases .
Collateral ?
Not much collateral with zero down mortgages .
And character was never evaluated .
How can one expect unethical lenders to judge the character of a borrower ?
Their primary concern was getting a fee .
There is much blame to go around regarding the housing bubble .
I am certain over the next few years we will hear much written as to why this bubble was caused and have historical studies examining this in detail .
Losing $ 50 trillion in wealth in one year warrants a deeper analysis .
Yet we are now hearing revisionist theories as to why this bubble was caused .
Let us first look at 5 reasons that did n’t cause this housing bubble .
5 Reasons That Did n’t Cause the Housing Bubble :
(1) Incomes Rising
* Click for larger image
The first theory regarding rising incomes can be easily put to rest .
First , we can measure over the past 13 years purchasing power versus incomes .
As you can see from the above chart , the purchasing power of someone from 1995 to 2006 tripled while incomes only went up 30 percent .
Incomes did not triple .
The median household did n’t start making $ 100,000 , in fact the median income for a family in the U.S. in 2008 is $ 46,000 .
There is no merit to this argument .
Incomes did rise but not to the point of justifying the prices we saw in the current housing market .
(2) Land Shortage
This was another argument that never held water .
The notion that we were somehow running out of land .
This argument was made in Japan during their real estate bubble and they actually had more ground to stand on with this argument since they are after all an island .
Yet the U.S. has none of these limitations .
In fact , take a look at the Southern California map above .
This was one of the preposterous notions going around California during the epic bubble here in the state .
All the circled areas for anyone who has flown or driven through the area , are places where theoretically homes could be built .
Hey , if we can build a gambling paradise in the middle of the desert with Las Vegas , there is no reason for homes not to be placed here .
Yet the truth of this argument is people wanted to live in coastal regions .
So the argument should have been rephrased to say land shortages in prime coastal regions .
Well , that is always the case .
Yet many areas that were never prime or even near the coast went through the roof .
Many studies have come out saying that we have a shortage of “ affordable ” housing , not mega priced bubble homes .
The fact that California will see at least a 50 % peak to trough drop in price should cement any notion that prices went up because of land shortages .
Clearly , there is plenty of land .
(3) Poor People
For a few months , we had some absurd notion that poor people caused this global credit calamity .
$ 50 trillion in global wealth evaporated because some people in the inner-cities of America bought too much good property .
Show me a poor person buying a $ 10 million home in the Hamptons or Beverly Hills .
By the way , many of those properties are now selling for millions off but I doubt someone making $ 46,000 a year is going to buy that up .
First , take a look at the above chart .
The subprime problem , or loans made to those with poor credit or weak incomes was only a tiny portion of this global mess .
In fact , most of the subprime problems have already washed out .
They were the first to default since many of these people were marginal to begin with .
They had no buffer to back them up from any economic calamity .
Most of the subprime debt has already been written down by originators since the likelihood of collecting is very slim .
Yet this notion that somehow poor people through down payment programs or government encouragement caused this bubble is flat out condescending and points the blame on the wrong group .
Where there many lower income people that bought homes that should n’t ?
Of course !
But look at the above chart and you tell me that this was the reason for the housing bubble .
It was n’t .
Most of that has already washed out of the system .
Now we are seeing prime and Alt - A loans go bad .
Why ?
Many hard working Americans , middle class Americans are losing their jobs .
If you want to call someone that went from middle class to poor as causing this housing bubble then you are probably left with little evidence to justify your argument .
The data simply does not back you up .
(4) New Paradigm
The fact that the bubble has now exploded is proof enough that this idea is wrong .
There was and is no new paradigm with housing .
Historically housing has always been a relatively boring investment .
This housing bubble was sold on similar ideas of the 1920s Florida housing bubble which also included Charles Ponzi , the person who now is referenced when we talk about Mr. Madoff and his $ 50 billion Ponzi scheme .
The new paradigm was based on this notion that housing and finance have somehow through financial alchemy created a new way of looking at the world .
Through risk management all problems were washed out of the system by creative financial tinkering .
This of course is wrong and made no sense .
The bubble bursting is enough reason to put to rest this argument .
(5) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the two big government sponsored entities are still taking much of the blame for this housing bubble .
In fact , these two entities came late to the toxic mortgage party .
It is true that these 2 agencies have extreme problems yet they were egged on to get into the toxic mortgage party and fortunately , did not jump in head over heels .
Most of the truly toxic stuff like option ARMs and subprime stayed out of the books of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
In fact , the next big problems we will see will come from the option ARM front , something Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have nothing to do with .
So blaming Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for our problems is missing the point .
The fact that many so - called cautious business people were encouraging Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to step into the toxic mortgage lender vacuum was absurd but proves again how looking at them is barking up the wrong tree .
For the most part , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchase relatively safe mortgages .
Yet what is truly safe when we have a global calamity and market volatility not seen in over a century ?
5 Reasons That Did Cause the Housing Bubble :
(1) Wall Street
Remember that chart above when we talked about poor people ?
Well that chart also includes many kinds of mortgage debt .
If you add every area above you wo n’t come close to matching the credit default insurance market which was a pet project of Wall Street .
Now take a look at this chart :
This market is huge , unregulated , and a financial bomb that has been going off .
In fact , when Lehman Brothers collapsed one of the fears was the collateral it will cause with other folks making these bets .
Where you making these bets ?
Do you think poor people were investing here ?
Do you think average Americans have any money here ?
Sure , we can argue that some top mutual fund investors placed the money of many Americans here but that was stupid to begin with .
This market is an absolute mess and larger than any can imagine .
The fact that the credit default insurance market is twice as big as the U.S. stock market should tell you something .
Many times Wall Street made bets on non-existent things , derivatives ( as in derived from phony make believe notions ) and placed large amounts of money on these make believe securities .
Since they needed some substance for this make believe , they had a never ending appetite for mortgage backed securities .
That is , their hunger allowed lenders to make the most absurd loans and find a market for it .
After all , if a lender needed to hold a mortgage on their books , do you think they would make it ?
Of course not .
Now , standards are back into place and we are seeing that Americans even with historically low interest rates still have a hard time buying homes in this current market .
They were able to push prices higher because of the leverage we discussed earlier .
It was n’t income .
It was the ability to get these loans .
Yet Wall Street never exercised restraint or caution here .
In fact , they put the world economy at risk here and now are complaining to our government for bailouts which include nice little paychecks for them .
Should n’t we be throwing these people into jail like the criminals they truly are ?
(2) Lenders willing to allow higher debt - to - income ratios
You need to remember that lenders did not operate in a vacuum here .
Taking reason number 1 above , you can understand why lenders were so willing to make these toxic mortgages with no hesitation .
In fact , if you look at the credit default insurance market , there is almost a perfect correlation between the growth in CDS and toxic mortgages .
After all , the geniuses at Wall Street figured that you can take a toxic mortgage and with the right kind of insurance , insulate yourself off from any problems .
This is like a fountain of youth argument .
Life is full of risks .
You ca n’t make a toxic loan turn into gold yet this is what they believed .
They believed it because they made bets on this assumption .
Lenders of course not caring about collateral , capacity , or character were driven strictly by fees .
That is why many once mighty lenders like IndyMac and WaMu are now gone in the ash heap of banks who believed their own hype .
So lenders followed the “ well X should have known better ” mantra meaning Wall Street should have done THEIR due diligence while they collected their absurd fees while doing zero due diligence .
They were complicit just as much as Wall Street .
But in raw numbers , they were merely puppets in the game of Wall Street if you look at the nominal values .
Many smaller lenders are realizing you need big sums of money and political connections to receive bailouts .
Many of the i-banks had this aside from Lehman Brothers .
So lenders were all the willing to make toxic loans and Wall Street was more than willing to oblige to purchase these loans to make more stupid side bets on loans that really never had any chance of ever being repaid .
(3) Falling interest rates encouraged by the Fed
Let us first say something .
The Federal Reserve cares nothing about the U.S. Dollar .
The U.S. Treasury does n’t care if the U.S. Dollar carries the same value as toilet paper .
As I ’ve argued before , their policies in fact are hoping to destroy the U.S. Dollar .
Alan Greenspan once stated publicly how fantastic adjustable rate mortgages were and encouraged the use of these .
Recently , he has been on a legacy tour yet thanks to the speed of the modern press his reputations is taking the much deserved hits it needs .
He is an accomplice to this housing bubble .
His record low rates and notion that adjustable rate mortgages were good demonstrate his responsibility in knowing that lower rates would thus fuel more borrowing .
Remember that crazy leverage chart above ?
He was totally okay with this .
He took rates to record lows and thus created an environment that was still hungry for another bubble .
He could have easily stopped any bubble from forming by taking rates a bit higher and making money harder to come by .
We would have had a recession , maybe minor but now we are left with dealing with the worst recession since World War II .
Greenspan is gone and so is his reputation .
Bernanke is now taking the ship and he is even less shy about destroying the U.S. dollar .
The fact that rates are now at basically zero , shows how low he is willing to go .
There is no bottom .
In fact , now that we have reached bottom he is discussing more absurd notions of taking on more debt onto the books of the U.S. even though we already have $ 3 trillion of questionable assets on the books !
By the way , Bloomberg and Fox are suing the Fed to release this data .
After all , it is our money that is at risk .
The Fed is another party responsible for the housing bubble .
(4) Toxic mortgages
Toxic mortgages of course , were simply the weapon of choice of the above reasons .
After all , you need an effective vector to gather and collect mortgages .
Your army ?
Mortgage brokers and banks that have the ability far from Wall Street to find souls , any soul to sign their name on the dotted line to buy a home .
The buyers have been primed by reality show drivel like Flip this House or napkin real estate analysis like Rich Dad , Poor Dad and the ground was set for nearly 3 decades to create this epic housing bubble .
The bank and lender foot soldiers were easy to gather .
All they wanted was a quick hit like a junkie .
They wanted a fee and that was it .
That is why many of these people now find themselves out of work .
Very few invested wisely and many are now left broke or getting foreclosed since they bought into their own delusional analysis .
Yet lenders were the street dealers .
Wall Street was the head capo at command central dishing out the orders on toxic mortgages .
As you can see from the above chart , what we have recently seen is the world markets have done a global intervention and the game is over .
The supply is finished .
Now we are left dealing with this .
(5) Greed
None of this could have happened without the last ingredient .
Human greed .
That is why we have placed strong regulations on Wall Street since the Great Depression .
The Glass - Steagall Act of 1933 established the FDIC and also included banking reforms which were designed to control speculation .
This was all repealed in 1999 .
The major item was the ability for banks being prohibited from owning other financial companies .
Why do you think JP Morgan Chase was able to gobble up Bear Stearns ?
Or Bank of America ’s ability to buy Countrywide Financial and Merrill Lynch ?
Is this really good ?
Having these mega entities ?
Either way , the profit motive is what drew many people to buy homes for speculation .
It is the reason Wall Street created a credit default market that now rivals global GDP !
Greed was the main reason banks and lenders pumped toxic mortgages onto the street in place of more traditional and safer conventional mortgage products .
To say we are all to blame is too simple of an explanation .
Some are much more culpable than others here .
That is how we assign blame in our country .
We do n’t expect someone that stole $ 10 from their mom to be punished the same way someone who stole $ 50 billion from others .
Or is our analysis going to believe the simple minded notion that poor people looking for land created this housing bubble ?

Even from this distance I could see it was something special , too thin and graceful to be another of the same residential complexes I had spent hours fighting through .
The base of the structure seemed to merge into the ground , as if some bored god had melted the sand into liquid glass and pulled the spire up from it .
I could make out the shapes of the Enemy ’s forces , infantry manning hardened emplacements and heavy weapons where the tower ’s tapering base rose out of the surrounding buildings and smoke like an artificial hill .
Our forces would have to fight uphill across the open ground to reach the central spire , without the benefit of the concealing smoke .
I tapped into the localized Datanet our forces had set up and scanned the local chatter for any useful information .
Gavin Yukoro 176 was making a speech , trying to rally troops for the upcoming assault .
The Gavin Yukoros were always making big , grandoise speeches about abstract concepts like glory and honor , and I quickly filtered him out .
Reports were coming in from other cities , some were so completely deserted that the assault groups had simply started fires and hijacked transports to other parts of the globe , and some were so heavily fortified that the fleet had to nuke them from orbit to soften them up for the ground attack .
I uploaded my observations and theories to the Speculation > Population ?
Forum and made my way back to the lift .
There was no information on the tower to the north , so if I was going to satisfy my curiosity , I would have to do it on my own .
!RECORDING ENDS
If movies and soap operas are anything to go by , sex can be dangerous for people with heart conditions .
Dangers posed by sexual activity is probably minimal , but heart disease could curtail your sex life .
While research shows that sex can indeed trigger heart attacks in some people , especially men , the odds of literally succumbing to passion are very low .
Sexual activity is a contributing factor in less than 1 percent of heart attacks , according to a 1996 study by Harvard Medical School researchers .
Although heart attacks during sex are rare , no one wants to be among the unlucky few who die while getting lucky .
So if you have cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , or even if it runs in your family , it 's important to ask your doctor what type of sexual activity is safe .
If you 've just had a heart attack , for instance , you should wait three to four weeks before having intercourse , according to current guidelines .
And if you have heart failure , your doctor may recommend that you avoid lying on your back during sex , because fluid is more likely to pool in your lungs in that position .
Health.com : Heart health step - by - step
The physical danger posed by sexual activity is probably the least of your problems , however .
There are plenty of other ways for heart disease to curtail your sex life .
Everything from incision pain following bypass surgery to the emotional stress of living with a heart condition can get in the way of intimacy .
Sexual activity and heart conditions can interact in complicated ways , which can be difficult to tease apart .
To make matters worse , heart patients ( and their partners ) are often uncomfortable discussing their sex lives with their doctors and vice versa .
" I 've found that most doctors do n't have the time -- or the personality -- to talk about sex with their heart patients , " says Dr. Edward Chapunoff , a cardiologist in private practice in Pompano Beach , Florida , and the author of " Answering Your Questions About Heart Disease and Sex . "
" They are evasive about it , " he said .
" They wo n't bring it up themselves and even if the patient brings it up , a doctor might be hesitant to discuss it . "
So what 's a heart patient to do ?
Prepare a list of intimacy questions in advance of your next checkup and do n't let your doctor 's squirming deter you .
In the meantime , here are some answers to three not - so - frequently asked questions about sex and heart disease .
Is my sexual dysfunction related to my heart ?
The link between cardiovascular disease and sexual dysfunction is well established , at least in men .
Researchers have known for years that erectile dysfunction ( ED ) is disproportionately common among men with CVD ( and even among those with risk factors for CVD , such as diabetes and high blood pressure ) .
While erectile dysfunction can result from a number of factors , including psychological ones , the majority of cases can be traced to vascular problems .
The shared mechanism linking ED and CVD is believed to originate in the endothelium , the thin layer of cells that lines blood vessels .
Risk factors such as high cholesterol , high blood pressure , and cigarette smoking prevent cells in the endothelium from releasing nitric oxide .
This compromises the ability of blood vessels to dilate , which can lead to both atherosclerosis and erectile dysfunction .

Atherosclerosis , the hardening and narrowing of the arteries that causes coronary heart disease , can affect the arteries that pump blood into the penis just as readily as those that surround the heart .
But endothelial problems can also prevent the so - called smooth muscle in the penis from relaxing properly .
In either case , erections become harder to sustain .
For a long time it was thought that ED was strictly a side effect of CVD and atherosclerosis , but experts now believe that ED may actually precede heart problems .
A 2005 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association described ED as a " harbinger " of cardiovascular events .
The study , which analyzed more than 4,000 men without symptoms of CVD or ED , found that the men who subsequently experienced ED were nearly 50 percent more likely than those who did not to experience a cardiovascular event within seven years .
" It 's important to know that just looking fine does n't necessarily mean you have a healthy heart , " says Chapunoff .
" It 's important that both the patient and their partner talk to their doctor about any sexual dysfunction , because it could signal a cardiac problem . "
In women , the relationship between CVD and sexual dysfunction is less clear .
Although sexual dissatisfaction in women has been linked to peripheral arterial disease , the mechanisms of female sexual function are thought to be less intertwined with the cardiovascular system .
Do my heart meds have any sexual side effects ?
If your heart does n't cause you problems in the bedroom , the medicine you take to keep it healthy might .
Several medications commonly prescribed to heart patients can have sexual side effects in both men and women , including ED and loss of libido .
Two kinds of cholesterol - lowering drugs , fibrates and statins , have been linked with ED , but it is mainly blood - pressure medications that are believed to contribute to sexual dysfunction .
Health.com : 7 causes of high cholesterol
Beta - blockers , calcium channel blockers , angiotensin - II receptor antagonists , and diuretics are all associated with ED .
Although some experts have argued that hypertension itself is responsible for ED , a 2007 study in the International Journal of Impotence Research found that men taking angiotensin - II receptor antagonists were twice as likely to experience ED than men whose hypertension was untreated .
Another study of nearly 1,400 men determined that taking hypertension drugs ( diuretics , beta - blockers , methyldopa , or clonidine ) increased the odds of experiencing ED by 2.5 times .
Blood - pressure medications are also known to cause sexual dysfunction in women , although the phenomenon has n't been studied as extensively as it has in men .
One reason for the disparity may be that the most common symptoms in women -- loss of libido , inadequate lubrication -- are more subtle than ED .
When Liz Saldana , 48 , the owner of an online magazine and store in Tampa , Florida , first started taking a beta - blocker , she saw her sex drive shrink significantly .
" I went from being a really vibrant woman to someone who could just live without it , " she says .
" When my husband initiated anything , my attitude became , ' Oh damn , do we have to do this ? ' "
She was too embarrassed to bring up the issue with her doctor .
" Initially I thought my lack of sex drive pertained to all of the stress I was under , not to my heart medications , " says Saldana , who was on the beta - blocker Toprol - XL ( metoprolol ) before suffering a heart aneurysm in July .
" None of my doctors explained that it could be a side effect of what I was on . "
It was n't until she switched insurance companies and got a call from one of the nurses on staff that she finally got to the root of her problem : " She asked a couple of questions that acted as a trigger for me to evaluate my sex drive and realize what was wrong . "

Even though sexual problems are among the most commonly reported side effects from blood - pressure drugs , they have not been well publicized and patients may not realize that their prescriptions are to blame .
If you suspect that your heart medications are interfering with your sex life , explain the problem to your doctor and ask about alternative medications .
Men may be able to counteract the problem with an ED drug such as Viagra .
While they can be potentially fatal when taken with nitrates , ED drugs can be safely combined with many heart medications .
Why can't I get in the mood ?
Medications can dampen your sex drive , but psychological factors might also be at play .
For one thing , sexual dysfunction is a common psychosomatic side effect of medication ( sometimes called a " nocebo effect " ) .
But the emotional strain that accompanies heart disease can also impact your sex life .
After a cardiac episode , many patients find that any activity in the bedroom leaves them paralyzed with anxiety .
" After a heart attack , not only are you physically weak , but you 're scared that something might happen during sex , " says Chapunoff .
Saldana is gearing up to have open - heart surgery in the near future .
She and her husband of 15 years are sexually active about twice a month , but each time she 's terrified that she 'll have a heart attack .
" I experience a lot of chest pains and when things get heated , I can't have him on top of me , " she explains .
" I have n't shared my fear with my husband , but I 'm afraid to lose control for even a moment because it feels like he 's crushing my chest . "
And then there 's the possible role of depression .
Research suggests that heart disease and depression are closely related ; depression is roughly three times more prevalent among heart attack survivors than in the general population .
But depression is also independently associated with sexual dysfunction ( including loss of libido and ED ) , which suggests that , for heart patients , both their bodies and their minds may be affecting their sex lives .
Sexual dysfunction that appears to be caused by a heart problem may also be a sign of an underlying emotional issue , according to Chapunoff .
" Heart disease can become the scapegoat , " he says .
" People might say , ' I had a heart attack six months ago , so I can't have sex now , ' when really it could be unhappiness that they fail to recognize . "

Dale Morrison of the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission holds a giant salmon carcass found last week on Battle Creek .
That is a rather large fish .
Of course , you know what they say some Bigfoot eat , do n’t you ?
Wildlife officials in northern California last week came across one of the biggest Chinook salmon ever found in the state — a monster more than 4 feet long and weighing 85 pounds .
The Chinook salmon ( Oncorhynchus tshawytscha ) is a Pacific Ocean salmon , variously known as the king salmon , tyee salmon , Columbia River salmon , black salmon , chub salmon , hook bill salmon , winter salmon , Spring Salmon , Quinnat Salmon and blackmouth .
“ We see lots of big ones , ” Doug Killam , a biologist in the California Department of Fish and Game ’s Red Bluff office , told the Redding Record Searchlight ’s Dylan Darling , “ but this one was just bigger than most big ones — it was just spectacular . ”
Measuring in at 51 inches – 4 1 / 4 feet – long , the male salmon was likely five to six years old , Killam said .
Scientists used the salmon ’s girth and length to come up with their estimate of 85 pounds – and that ’s dead .
The salmon probably weighed about 90 pounds alive when it started its swim from the Pacific Ocean back to Battle Creek , a tributary of the Sacramento River near the town of Anderson .
The California sport - fishing record for a Chinook salmon is 88 pounds .
In Alaska , where they ’re called king salmon , they get even bigger — the record sport catch is 97 pounds , while the largest commercial catch was a truly phenomenal 126 pounds .
“ If someone would have caught this one , it probably would have been a state record , ” Killam told the Record Searchlight .
Ironically , the sad state of salmon spawning in the Pacific Northwest probably helped this one live a full life .
Ocean commercial catches were canceled this year , and the river sport season on the Sacramento drastically shortened .
The salmon found on Battle Creek is part of a meager salmon run on the stream that feeds the nicely named Coleman National Fish Hatchery .
But wait a second .
Forgive me for being careful about a photograph like the one floating around with this giant salmon story .
Did n’t you ask yourself immediately whether it was photoshopped or an outright fake ?
Is this because we all are use to seeing hoaxed pictures like this ?
We all know the Wild West has a tradition of funny postcard - type images , do n’t we ?
There is a new book with one of these old trophy fish covers , just out , entitled Giant Salmon : A Record of the Largest Atlantic Salmon Ever Caught ( Firefly Books ) .
It was released on September 12 , 2008 , and is authored by Fred Buller .
At 480 pages long , the large tome concerns the true fish tales of record Atlantic salmon ( not Pacific salmon , please note ) fly catches around the world .
I have n’t seen a copy yet , but I ’m interested .
About Loren Coleman
Loren Coleman is one of the world ’s leading cryptozoologists , some say “ the ” leading living cryptozoologist .
Certainly , he is acknowledged as the current living American researcher and writer who has most popularized cryptozoology in the late 20th and early 21st centuries .
Starting his fieldwork and investigations in 1960 , after traveling and trekking extensively in pursuit of cryptozoological mysteries , Coleman began writing to share his experiences in 1969 .
An honorary member of Ivan T. Sanderson ’s Society for the Investigation of the Unexplained in the 1970s , Coleman has been bestowed with similar honorary memberships of the North Idaho College Cryptozoology Club in 1983 , and in subsequent years , that of the British Columbia Scientific Cryptozoology Club , CryptoSafari International , and other international organizations .
He was also a Life Member and Benefactor of the International Society of Cryptozoology ( now - defunct ) .
Loren Coleman ’s daily blog , as a member of the Cryptomundo Team , served as an ongoing avenue of communication for the ever - growing body of cryptozoo news from 2005 through 2013 .
He returned as an infrequent contributor beginning Halloween week of 2015 .
Coleman is the founder in 2003 , and current director of the International Cryptozoology Museum in Portland , Maine .

Personally , I can't see how all five of these do n't apply to any news organization that 's writing a story that follows a " scoop " by a competitor .
( v ) the ability of other parties to free - ride on the efforts of the plaintiff or others would so reduce the incentive to produce the product or service that its existence or quality would be substantially threatened .
Well , let it not be said that I fell down on the job when " hot news " crossed my beat .
I took a look at both sides ' motions and the judge 's ruling to learn more about the case .
The doctrine raises some questions for me about journalistic practice and ethics .
And , it has some interesting history to boot .
A New York federal judge ruled Tuesday that The Associated Press can sue its competitors not merely for copyright infringement , but for a " quasi property " right in the news known as the " hot news " doctrine .
See the AP 's own coverage .
It 's quite common for editors to ask reporters to " match " a story that has been published or broadcast by a competitor by re-tracing the facts , and often the sources , of the " scoop . "
As long as it's all re-reported and re-written , that 's fair game .
But the criteria of a " hot news " claim are still met ; because newsgathering still costs money , the information is still time - sensitive ( that 's why we 're rushing to get the second - day story ) , and it could still be thought of as " free - riding " if the second news outlet is just publishing a do - over of the themes , sources , ideas , in the first article — and such second - day stories could reduce the incentive to get scoops .
( Although " substantially threaten " might be a reach . )
It 's all a bit theoretical , since individual scoops are n't really worth that much money , but it does seem like " hot news " misappropriation claims could allow any scooper to sue the still - competing " scoopee . "
Now in this case , the AP argues that the defendant , All Headline News ( AHN ) , has no " newsgathering " operation at all , and that it just re-writes AP articles shortly after they 're published on various Internet sites .
But that seems irrelevant to the analysis presented in this order .
The History of " Hot News "
The " hot news " doctrine that The Associated Press now wants to enforce is actually a product of a much earlier AP litigation .
" Hot news " originates in a lawsuit that AP brought 90 years ago against a competing news service , International News Service ( INS ) , which was owned by Hearst and later became part of United Press International ( UPI ) .
" In 1918 , INS was unable to provide its clients with news stories from the war zones because , having been accused of violating wartime censorship restrictions , it was barred from use of the British and French mail and cables , " writes the AP in its brief against AHN .
INS solved that problem by grabbing early editions printed in AP newspapers and sending them to its own clients .
INS even bribed employees of the AP and AP member newspapers to get AP 's news before it was published .
( And yet , the AP notes — " Unlike AHN , INS was a real news service , with reporters who gathered the news . " )
Ultimately , the Second Circuit found that AP had a property right , separate from copyright , in the news that it sold , " arising from the labor and expense involved in its gathering and disseminating that news . "
This right could only be used against competitors and only lasted as long as the news had commercial value .
The case then went to the Supreme Court , which voted 5 - 3 in favor of the AP's " quasi property " and upheld the 2nd Circuit decision .
Justice Brandeis wrote in dissent :
[ T ]he fact that a product of the mind has cost its producer money and labor , and has a value for which others are willing to pay , is not sufficient to ensure to it this legal attribute of property .
The general rule of law is , that the noblest of human productions – knowledge , truths ascertained , conceptions , and ideas – become after voluntarily communication to others , free as the air to common use .
International News Service v. Associated Press , 1918 .
That decision is no longer federal law , for reasons I wo n't get into , but it has been integrated into the common law in several states , including New York , where this case is being litigated .
AHN argued that the dissenters ' view was ultimately victorious , because of a later decision , Feist Publications .
In that case , the court made it clear that it was perfectly legal to copy a phone book , which held uncopyrightable facts , regardless of how much hard work goes into making a phone book .
( And the AP does go on in this case about the time and expense of its newsgathering operation . )
" The views of Justices Holmes and Brandeis have ultimately prevailed , and INS has been filed away as an accident of history .
To the extent any state law still attempts to breath life into the case or its doctrine , it too must fall . "
AHN also argued that the " hot news " doctrine was just meant to apply to bad actors like INS , which bribed AP employees and intercepted AP telegraph messages .
Successful " misappropriation " claims involved confidential information not yet released to the public , and recent court rulings have only found misappropriation where there was " fraud or deception , or an abuse of a fiduciary or confidential relationship . "
It argued that despite all the AP 's rhetoric about its newsgathering operation , all it had was a copyright claim ( which is still alive , and AHN has said it will contest vigorously . )
Interestingly , AHN mentions in a footnote the AP 's controversial copyright campaign against bloggers , even citing BoingBoing , in a July 2008 motion : " Within the past month , the AP has apparently sent threats to various third parties , such as bloggers , for doing nothing more than copying one or two paragraphs of AP content ( which virtually anyone would consider a fair use under copyright law ) .
The AP has also apparently recently begun a “ licensing ” program in which it demands extortionate royalties from anyone who copies merely five words or more from an AP story , regardless of fair use . "
( See p.1 , AHN Reply , PDF ]
The AP notes that AHN has no news operation at all , and says its employees just browse the Internet scooping up AP copy and re-writing it .
AP also accuses AHN of paying its writers badly , and says the company is now " off - shoring " preparation of AHN news stories to the Phillippines and Malaysia .
( But paying writers poorly , I happen to know , is not a crime . )
AP lawyers explain their support for " hot news " lawsuits : " Today more than ever , the public needs the hot - news doctrine to protect its access to news .
News happens globally , in conflict zones and disaster areas .
Most of the time , the reporter has to go to the news , often by overcoming various barriers to access .
To collect this news requires massive , continuing investments by news services ... they must be able to recoup their costs by selling their news stories to newspapers , websites , and other publishers .
They cannot profitably do so in the face of parasites like AHN . "
Judge Kevin Castel wrote that the defendants did n't have any good reasons why the most recent 2nd Circuit case on this issue should not apply here .
In that case , the NBA was allowed to use the " hot news " doctrine to sue Motorola for transmitting its basketball game scores .

Recipe for Doughnuts
Ignore the Content
In this series , I ’m exploring the stories I find myself coming back to in work and life .
I call them Things I Learned the Hard Way .
My dad , the great psychologist , once told me that he thought kids would be a snap .
In college , he ’d trained rats to run mazes in the dark .
Surely he had a keen insight into behavioral training .
Problem was , rats do n’t smile at you , say they ’ll be home by midnight , steal your car , and stay out all night .
Suffice to say , dad found raising me and my sister to be more challenging than expected .
But he has taught me a few things , and one I keep coming back to is : ignore the content .
Sometimes , when dealing with an interpersonal conflict , logically addressing the complaints is that last thing that will help .
Instead , try to address the emotion behind it .
So , for example , when a kid is freaking out because ketchup was n’t applied to his hot dog in just the right way , it ’s never about the ketchup .
It ’s about a deeper issue ( control , fear , low blood sugar – whatever ) .
Apply this to web communities .
Say a well - known site , say , redesigns their homepage .
The new version could be better in every objective way , but users will still freak out .
Why ?
It ’s not the content – it ’s something deeper .
The freakouts mean , “ I love this site , I feel ownership of it , and you changed it , and that makes me mad . ”
When you look at it that way , you can see why a reasonable , factual response on why the new design is better will not work .
Instead , you have to address the feelings behind the complaint .
For example :
“ You ’re a valuable member , and we really appreciate how much time and energy you ’ve put into the site .
We know change can be hard , and we appreciate you writing to tell us your feelings .
We think the new version is better , but you do n’t have to agree .
All we ask is that you give it a little time .
See how you feel about it next week , and write us again .
We ’re grateful for your participation , and sincerely thank you for your feedback . ”
See what I did there ?
No selling the new site .
Instead , praise the user for giving a shit ( and you should – trust me , I ’ve run sites that nobody cared about and it ’s much worse ) , try to make them feel important , show that you take it seriously , and ask for a little time .
With most redesigns , within a week , all the bitching is over ( or , at least , moved on to something new ) .
If there are major themes in the members ’ complains , maybe there really is something wrong .
They ’re doing you a favor by pointing out the problems .
Take them seriously and implement changes .
The complainers will become your most dedicated fans if they see that their input results in positive changes .
The next time someone complains to you , try to ignore the content of the complaint and address the emotion behind it instead .
You ’ll be amazed how quickly you can convert the haters to lovers and make your site better at the same time .
Vitamin D for Cold and Flu
Symptoms Could be More
Effective Than Flu Shots
Using Vitamin
D for cold and flu symptoms is an underused , effective natural immune boosting strategy .
Vitamin C and zinc have been getting all of the press lately about colds and flu , but Vitamin D and the flu is a real winner too .
Vitamin D and the Common Cold Virus
A well organized study that followed over 100 postmenopausal women for 1 year while they were taking 4000 IU of Vitamin D daily , had only one women get cold or flu symptoms IN THE ENTIRE YEAR !
That ’s ONE cold in ONE year in over 100 women
By the way , that was NOT one cold PER PERSON for the year , that was ONE COLD FOR 100 people .
How many total colds do you and 99 friends get every year ?
Another study entitled Serum 25 - hydroxyvitamin d and the incidence of acute viral respiratory tract infections in healthy adults found that when levels of Vitamin D were at or above 38 ng / ml , that the incidence of colds and flu were cut in half .
A large scale study that reviewed the current literature also found that Colds and Flu Were Reduced in Those Taking Vitamin D Supplements .
Not surprisingly , the people most protected were those with the lowest levels of Vitamin D .
Vitamin D is a potent Immune System stimulant , as we discussed on the main Vitamin D Facts page .
One of its immune system functions is to help trigger production of a substance called cathelicidin .
Cathelicidin is a naturally produced antibiotic that is able to be made only in the presence of high Vitamin D levels in the bloodstream , higher than the vast majority of the population has .
Thus Vitamin D for cold and flu symptoms could also be a possible treatment for colds and flu , according to some researchers .
There is much more Vitamin D Research that connects lower Vitamin D levels to a higher rate of cold symptoms in children and adults - like This February 2009 Article from the Archives of Internal Medicine .
It 's also well known that Children with Rickets ( severe Vitamin D deficiency leading to bowed bones ) have much higher incidences of respiratory infections .
Another reason that Vitamin D for cold and flu symptoms may be effective , is that Vitamin D Deficiency may contribute to periodontal disease .
And Periodontal Disease - by pouring large amounts of bacteria into the bloodstream - is a serious drain on the immune system .
“ Theoretically , pharmacological
doses of vitamin D
( 2000 IU / kg / day for 3 days )
may produce enough … cathelicidin to cure …
influenza and the common cold … ”
-‘ Use of Vitamin D in Clinical Practice ’
When the immune system is already working overtime , it 's not going to be able to fight off colds and flu effectively .
So a combination of using Vitamin D Supplements and Correcting Periodontal Disease by having excellent Oral Health and Hygiene could be a serious One - Two Punch for Seasonal AND even Swine Flu Prevention .
Vitamin D and Flu Symptoms
Can Vitamin
D affect the rate of flu symptoms and even stave off epidemics ?
One comprehensive Vitamin D research paper , ‘ On the epidemiology of influenza ’ , theorizes that Vitamin D and the flu may be even MORE closely linked .
The study says that a low Vitamin D level may actually be the CAUSE of Flu Symptoms in the first place .
This theory suggests that the seasonal nature of flu symptoms , almost always in the wintertime , is because of rampant low Vitamin D levels at that time of the year affecting the rate of natural antibiotic production and thus decreasing the effectiveness of the immune system .
A newer study , The Role of ... Vitamin D in reducing case - fatality rates from the 1918 – 1919 influenza pandemic ... , supports this theory and relates the correlation between sunlight exposure and the rate of death from the flu .
It is an interesting point that cold and flu symptoms are primarily wintertime problems .
Have you ever wondered why that is ?
Well , now you might have the answer .
" Critics say we should not recommend vitamin D to prevent influenza until it is proven to do so ( It has not been ) .
The critics are thus saying , although they seem not to know it , " you should be vitamin D deficient this winter until science proves being vitamin D sufficient is better than being Vitamin D deficient . "
Such advice is clearly unethical and has never ever been the standard of care . "
Dr. John Cannell
The Vitamin D Council
Vitamin D and the flu are DEFINITELY linked , as is Selenium and The Flu .
While neither has been PROVEN beyond a shadow of a doubt to be an effective flu treatment or a cure for the common cold , Vitamin D for cold and flu symptoms COULD prove to be a formidable way to combat colds and flu .
If you decide to use Vitamin D for cold and flu symptoms , be sure that you read the Normal Vitamin D levels and the Vitamin D requirements page for extensive information on how to take Vitamin D safely and effectively .

The actions of Chesley Sullenberger in saving the lives of passengers on US Airways flight 1546 are exemplary , and he has earned the gratitude of everyone aboard .
( Why the writer would propose to waste such a talented individual and make him " the front runner to replace Hillary Clinton as New York ’s junior United States Senator " is beyond me . )
He has also earned the gratitude of citizens in the city where people have learned to look to the airplanes in the sky with fear , a fear that arose because static Federal bureaucratic policies proscribed arming pilots and prescribed disarming passengers , leading to the disaster on 9/11 .
Early reports indicate that the plane ’s engines might have been disabled because a flock of geese intercepted its flight path , with large birds being sucked into both engines depriving of them of the power to maintain flight .
On January 15th , one would think , most migratory waterfowl like geese would have flown south for the winter .
Where , then , did these birds come from ?
The New York Times reports " Canada geese , a frequent visitor to golf courses and open spaces in the metropolitan New York area during the winter , pose a particular danger to planes because of their size .
The impact of a 12 pound bird hitting a plane traveling at 150 miles per hour is equal to that of a 1,000 pound weight dropped from a height of 10 feet , according to experts on bird strikes . "
The answer begins to reveal itself .
The same geese that foul the pathways of suburban Westchester might just have caused this crash .
The issue is not a new one ; in fact , as Gail Collins wrote in 1999 about future suburban resident Hillary Clinton , " Like the president , geese are especially attracted to golf courses .
Westchester County , where the Clintons have purchased a $ 1.7 million home , has more than 60 courses .
This is an area under siege by fowl who appreciate the virtues of waterfront property and well - manicured lawns …
Many of the first lady ’s future neighbors seemed ready to follow any politician who would promise to make the resident waterfowl go back to migrating . "
And why should " neighbors " support " politician (s ) " who would make waterfowl migrate , something birds would normally undertake on their own ?
Well , the " Canada " geese are presumably migratory , and are covered by treaties : in other words , they are under the control of the Federal Government , which protects them from any harm .
The fact that they do not migrate is immaterial : no state or local government can harm them in parks , and no private landowner of a golf course can shoot , trap or harass them from his property .
Once again , uniform Federal rules have usurped local control and private property rights ; thankfully , an accountable private airline ’s pilot was there to protect us from our protectors .

Turley : Obama ' owns ' Bush ' war crimes ' if he looks the other way David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday January 13 , 2009
Print This Email This President George W. Bush 's offhand acknowledgement in an interview Sunday with Fox 's Brit Hume that he personally authorized the waterboarding of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed may create thorny legal and moral problems for incoming President Barack Obama .
Constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley told MSNBC's Keith Olbermann on Monday , " We now have President Bush speaking quite candidly that he was in the loop , we have Dick Cheney who almost bragged about it .
The question for Barack Obama is whether he wants to own part of this by looking the other way . "
Obama told ABC's George Stephanopoulos on Sunday , " We have not made final decisions , but my instinct is for us to focus on how do we make sure that moving forward we are doing the right thing .
That does n't mean that if somebody has blatantly broken the law , that they are above the law .
But my orientation 's going to be to move forward . "
" If waterboarding is torture -- and Barack Obama has said that it is torture , " Turley emphasized , " and torture is a war crime , then the president has committed a war crime if he did order waterboarding .
You have to do some heavy lifting to avoid the simplicity of that logic . "
Turley noted that individual CIA officers who carried out torture may be able to invoke the so - called " Gestapo defense " -- that they only followed orders they were assured were legal -- but that defense does not hold for those who gave the orders .
" It only works if you can reasonably rely on the advice , and it generally does not protect people like Bush , " Turley explained .
" You really can't go out and get radical or extreme lawyers , like John Yoo and Viet Dinh , and get them to enable you to do things that you know is a war crime . "
" There 's no real question that crimes were committed here by { Obama 's ] predecessor , " concluded Turley , " and he can either begin his administration as a man of principle , and allow the law to take us wherever it may lead , or he will inherit the same type of moral relativism that really corrupted the previous administration .
I 'm going to say a silent prayer for principle . "

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
The craze for touch - screen gadgets , sparked by Apple Inc ’s popular iPhone , is raising worries that a whole generation of consumer electronics will be out of the reach of the blind .
Patrick Morse shows off his new Apple iPhone 3G after spending the night in line outside an Apple Store in Boston , Massachusetts July 11 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Brian Snyder
Motown icon Stevie Wonder and other advocates came to the world ’s biggest gadget fest , the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week , to convince vendors to consider the needs of the blind .
Wonder told a CES event that his wishlist included a car he could drive -- which he acknowledged was probably “ a ways away ” -- and a Sirius XM satellite radio he could operate .
“ If you can take those few steps further , you can give us the excitement , the pleasure and the freedom of being a part of it , ” said the famed musician .
Wonder said some companies had managed to make their products more accessible to the blind , sometimes without even meaning to .
He cited an iPod music player and Research in Motion ’s BlackBerry as gadgets he likes to use .
Advocates argue that if product designers take into account blind needs , they would make electronics that are easier to use for the sighted as well .
The good news is that manufacturers do not need to put large sums of money into making products accessible , nor would they have to forsake innovation , said Chris Danielsen , a spokesman for the National Federation For The Blind .
“ We do n’t want to hold up technological progress , ” he said .
“ What we ’re saying is , think about the interface and set it up in such a way that it ’s simple ....
The simpler you make the user interface of a product , it ’s going to reach more people sighted or blind . ”
TOUCH SCREENS
With the popularity of touch screens , once simple products such as televisions and stereos have become difficult for blind people to use as they often require navigation of multiple menus that need to be seen to be used effectively .
“ That ’s an increasing problem with new digital devices .
It ’s easy to add feature after feature that ’s buried under menu after submenu , ” said Mike Starling , chief technology officer of National Public Radio , which is working on accessible options .
Manufacturers have been putting touch screens in everything from calculators and watches to computers and music players .
Sendero Group President Mike May , who is blind , joked , “ Can I ski 60 miles an hour downhill ?
Yes .
Use a flat panel microwave ?
No . ” Sendero makes GPS navigational devices that have an audio output for the blind .
There are also screen readers that give an audio reading of a phone ’s menu .
But Anne Taylor , director of access technologies at the National Federation for the Blind , says they do not yet help her to use a touch - screen phone .
She said the ability to use a device without needing to look at it could help sighted people who are driving or older people whose eyesight is starting to deteriorate .
While blind users can buy screen - reading software for $ 300 upward , it tends to only work on certain phones , often the most expensive smartphones .
Sendero said accessible technology is often expensive , and about 70 percent of the U.S. blind population is unemployed .
Taylor is using CES as a forum to present vendors a set of suggestions for product design that she sees benefiting both sighted and blind consumers .
For example , manufacturers could include an easy - to - use start - over button , different sounds for different menus , and controls with good tactile feedback .
PROGRESS
Ahead of the show , there were some signs that vendors , while unlikely to give up on the touch - screen trend , may be more ready to consider consumers with disabilities .
Developers at Google Inc are working on ways to make touch - screen phones , including those based on its own Android mobile software , usable for blind people .
National Public Radio announced a special radio receiver technology and software that would connect a digital radio to a dynamic Braille generating device .
It has also created special digital radio channels for readings of the day ’s newspapers .
Dice Electronics has made a prototype radio that incorporates the NPR technology , and NPR ’s Starling hopes this will become a commercial product in 2009 .
Starling has also set up meetings at CES with other manufacturers in the hope they will include NPR ’s technology .
He said responses to requests for information , which often go unheeded , are much more active this year .
Some manufacturers could use their production facilities to make such devices , as demand weakens for more mainstream products in the economic downturn , he said .
“ I think in general there may be a view that accessibility may be becoming the new green , ” said Starling .

[ Editor 's note : megaStryke wrote up this piece on the word vision and how it 's thrown around in relation to videogames .
-- CTZ ]
Far be it from me to impose my thoughts on how software developers should direct their projects .
If I had my way , games would return to NES - era pixelated affairs .
I mean , my favorite game of this past year was Mega Man 9 !
However , I understand that mine is not the ideal direction for the industry , that there is no reason to dump technology over some fantasy retro utopia .
It ’s not like I do n't enjoy the current stable of software anyway .
Now , I know you guys out there , the forum warriors and the blog commenters .
Always up for a good debate , you will argue over the capabilities of you favorite consoles and how games could look and play better on one over the other .
That 's fine .
My problem lies with some of the inane arguments typically paraded , one in particular which totally rubs me the wrong way .
To set the scene , imagine that you are anticipating high - profile console exclusive game when an announcement is made that it will be ported over to a competing console .
Maybe it will be a direct port but perhaps it will be a down - port .
Perhaps this game is a former PS3 - exclusive being reworked for the Wii .
In another case , you have been following the lead of a promising new game for an unannounced platform .
It sounds totally sweet and awesome and the hype begins to consume you .
Then the big reveal is made and it turns out to be ... a DS game .
At some point , the following will be dropped : " This is a disgrace !
Such wasted potential !
Why should the developers sacrifice their vision just to make a little extra cash ? "
I 've read those lines far too often and so have you .
I find it hard to believe that this is based in any genuine concern towards the advancement of as a " visionary " medium .
Let 's explore this curious term that has found its way into the gaming community lexicon , shall we ?
What 's " vision " ?
Better yet , who is visionary ?
Why , artists are visionary !
We use the term as a means with which to link games and art because developers are like artists and you would never ask an artist to sell himself or herself out for a little extra pocket change .
No , the original vision must be preserved and realized however the artist sees fit .
There 's a problem with this analogy , though .
" Art " in and of itself is not a profitable venture when applied to the demands of the media industry .
You may have " artists " working in the art department , on the sound team , or with the writing crew , yet all of them toil within the confines of a project intended for distribution to a buying public .
Debate all you want on whether or not an overall project , game or film or whatever , is a genuine work of art after it is released ... it is afirst and anything else second .
If the product does n't meet publisher expectations , expect to see a little less " art " next time around .
This is contrary to the mental image of the world - renowned painter crafting masterpiece after masterpiece in the comfort of his private studio .
It 's a glorious scenario but not typically a profitable one .
A lot of the most famous painters in history lived and died in poverty ...
Van Gogh anyone ?
The " starving artist " persona is one I highly doubt any sane game staffer seeking financial stability would pursue .
The truth is that games are dictated not only by orders from higher authorities but also by time constraints and budget concerns .
Milestones need to be met and stuff winds up on the cutting table .
A level here , an extra boss battle or two , a little " tightening up on the graphics , " cut , cut , snip , snip .
No game is ever shipped with all the content that the developers had originally planned .
Some of it goes into the sequel , some of it is lost , and all are victim to the mechanizations of the software development cycle .
In this sense , no developer 's " vision " is ever truly achieved .
Sure , project leads can and will fight to retain as much content as they can , but those with the most pull are the ones who have proven themselves to be masters of their craft .
You can count on one or two hands the number of game developers who are respected enough to be given free reign to spend as much time and money to ensure a blockbuster as they so desire ... legends like Shigeru Miyamoto and Will Wright .
Do n't be fooled into thinking that these guys are not immune to cutbacks , not to mention that they only got to where they are by proving that they can deliver results despite monumental hurdles : was Miyamoto ’s recycling of the hardware and arcade cabinets of Nintendo 's failedwas an enhanced version of the map editor from Wright 's first game , , that he tooled with in his spare time .
But what does any of that have to do with " vision " ?
I was under the impression that " vision " implied some transcendence of the norm , some new innovation that will change the foundation of gaming forever .
The city - building ofwas visionary .
The new cinema - quality experience offor the PSX was visionary .
The allowance of PC game mods was visionary .
An extra deathmatch mode or two or the ability to render the stitching on virtual cloth more realistically isvisionary .
I do n't mean to discredit how these extra bells and whistles can add to the overall experience , but simply being able to add more than what was available on lesser hardware does n't make a game a shining paragon of progress in the medium .
I caught a recent interview with Dave Woldman , producer for the PS3 and Xbox 360 ’s upcoming , and noticed this little nugget as to why there was no Wii version in the works :
Naturally , I would expect the HD consoles to yield greater visuals and infrastructure than the Wii .
What that has to do with " vision " is beyond me , but whatever .
Makes sense , right ?
Now , just over a week ago , there was an interview with John Calhoun , one of the game 's designers , in which he made this announcement in regards to the Wii port of the originalSo , the Wii version of the original game featured such fantastic controls that it became the foundation for the controls in the sequel .
Yet there is no Wii version .
So any control layout in , I suppose , would be an " unrealized vision " because neither the PS3 nor the Xbox 360 feature the Wii ’s dual - controller setup , right ?
Why would n't there be a Wii version ?
My hypothesis , and though I may be wrong I highly doubt it , is that EA is not concerning itself with " vision " as much as it is with whether it is fiscally responsible to develop a ground - up version exclusively for the Wii given how unreadable the Wii market is .
Somehow , I find that to be an easier pill to swallow then some developer 's pride over realizing " vision .
" I 've noticed something else .
Whenever " vision " gets tossed around , it is always with respect to some hardware - hungry beast or some Holy Grail , AAA - budgeted extravaganza .
It 's as if we , and I 'm referring to both the community and the software houses , believe a developer 's true intent can only be achieved given near - infinite resources or the latest - and - greatest in technology .
Let me roll back a bit here ...
I 've mentioned the constraints of working with a game company and the pressures of maintaining financial stability .
For those who eschew the cogs of big business , there 's always indie gaming .
Indie developers are small , set their own rules , take as long as they want , and experiment with design concepts that may never be green - lit by any major publisher .
They 've also crafted games that rival most commercial products in terms of creativity and beauty .
I am not going to bother listing examples as I 'm sure you 've played your fair share of freeware PC games and can vouch for my claim .
Do you know what these developers lack ?
The funds and the hardware that major companies take for granted .
Do n't tell me that these games are n't " visionary " because they do n't require a DX10 configuration for optimal performance .
Maybe some of these small teams aspire to greater goals , but I guarantee that most of them scale back their " visions " in accordance with the resources available to them .
Even if that 's not the case , it does n't take away from the brilliance of their design because no amount of money can make up for sheer ingenuity .
Maybe I 'm looking at this whole thing wrong .
Maybe I 'm thinking of " vision " in the wrong context .
Perhaps I should replace " vision " with " ambition . "
The more ambitious a project is , the more likely it is to require a greater level of time and dedication .
Ambition is an admirable trait , right ?
Ambition is no reason to go for broke , though .
There is a reason that these constraints are established and it is because overambition can be far more damaging than accepting a little performance scaling from conception to the final product .
You want to talk about overambition ?
Wanna know what happens when you fly a little too close to the sun ?
Ask the fine folks at Sony who after over a year of delays decided to release Home in a beta state of indefinite length and unfulfilled promises .
Ask the clowns at 3D Realms who after ten years of literally developingelse saw it fit to release a couple of nice wallet - sizedphotos and then , the following year , some handheld camera footage that was never meant to be seen .
Ask Yu Suzuki how he felt after spending $ 70 million on Shenmue only to realize that he would NEVER break even on the project even if one copy was sold to every Dreamcast owner on the planet , and then for kicks ask him howis coming along .
It 's no stretch to imagine that a single large , unwieldy project can sink a company in the near future .
It 's like a composer who pours everything he has into his magnum opus which turns out to be his requiem when he dies from the shame of having his show close after a single night playing in front of an empty theater .
Okay , I 'm exaggerating a bit , but there 's a kernel of truth in that .
For all this talk of maximizing the potential of a software 's target platform , why do people get in such a fuss over something like Blood of Bahamut coming to the DS ?
Apparently , gamers know the developer 's " vision " better than the developer because clearly such a game demands release on an HD console in order to realize its true potential .
Do we even know if Square Enix considered the home consoles before settling on the DS ?
Whether they did or not does n't matter .
There is no HD version , there never was an HD version , and I 'm going to go out on a limb here and say there never will be an HD version .
Why play the " what if " game ?
We could talk about what could have been until the cows come home , but there is no point in bemoaning the loss of something that never existed in the first place .
For all you know , there is some feature that can only be accomplished on the DS .
Unlike thosefellas , I have n't heard anything out of these guys about " vision " and potential , so let 's leave well enough alone .
I do n't care what kind of PR the game companies want to deliver .
What I care about is this annoying trend in the game community to speak of " vision " as if it really mattered .
Do you know what the truth is ?
It 's not the developer 's vision that is n't being met , it's .
That 's right .
It 's in the best interest of numero uno that the games you desire are built to your specifications .
It has nothing to do with art or potential , it is sour grapes over things beyond your control .
I 'm not saying that you can't feel some disappointment , but do n't build up some ideal game in La-La Land and then get upset when it becomes clear that the development team is n't following your imaginary floor plan .
Enough with " vision , " alright ?
Let 's strip that from our vocabulary right now .
I 'm sick of this garbage .
MySpace provided two state attorneys general the names of 90,000 registered sex offenders it had banned from its site in response to a subpoena .
The figure is 40,000 more than the amount previously acknowledged by MySpace , according to Attorney General Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut , who along with Attorney General Roy Cooper of North Carolina are among officials pressing social networking sites to adopt more stringent safety measures .
“ Almost 100,000 convicted sex offenders mixing with children on MySpace  shown by our subpoena  is absolutely appalling and totally unacceptable , ” Mr. Blumenthal said in a statement .
“ For every one of them , there may be hundreds of others using false names and ages . ”
Last year , MySpace , owned by News Corporation , and Facebook.com agreed to set security standards after the Web sites were criticized for not doing enough to protect minors from sexual predators lurking on social networking sites .
Rechargeable Batteries with Solar Cells
Project by Knut Karlsen
Prototypes
At home i always have some batteries lying around , either rechargeable or normal ones .
Usually they are empty , but i'd like them to be always fully charged .
I could use a normal charger and there is a lot of solar devices that charge rechargeable batteries .
I wanted it simpler ; why has n't anyone made a battery with integrated solar cells ?
The idea of the " SunCat " batteries where born .
The batteries should just bask in the sun like a cat and left for a while , in a sunny window , they would slowly recharge .
During my research for my diploma i was in touch with scientists at IFE that experimented with the production of flexible solar cells .
They where kind enough to send me some samples in the right dimensions that i could use for the prototypes ( full set at flickr ) : I had some older NiMH rechargeable batteries that i glued the flexible Photo Voltaic ( PV ) cells onto .
The PV cells are rated at 1.8V and the batteries are 1.5V so they match quite well .
Half glued you can see the really shiny polymer substrate backside of the PV cell .
The crude written text says : 3x0,6V B : 13.411.09
Which i guess is the voltage and a batch number .
Using a conductive silver pen and some flat wires from a broken canon lens I made an ok connection to the PV cell .
This setup is infact a ( quite weak ) trickle charge r.
It is not ideal , but really convenient .
A second version would have some electronics ( to check when full ) and capacitors to charge the batteries more efficiently , but the battery would then be smaller if it all needs to fit within a C - cell battery .
The sun did not shine today , infact it was snowing .
But i'll sure let them hang around in my window and take some more pictures when the sun shines .

Jan. 21 , 2009  --
On his first full day in office President Obama froze the salaries of his senior staff and imposed tough new rules for lobbying and for releasing public information .
The president will move quickly to close Guantanamo prison , the controversial detainee base in Cuba started by the Bush administration .
ABC News has learned Obama sent a messenger to Capitol Hill to brief members of Congress on orders he plans to sign tomorrow closing the base within a year .
Obama woke up in the White House for the first time and began a whirlwind day , having already set in motion Tuesday major policy changes for the new administration .
On his agenda for Day One , Obama summoned his economic advisers to hammer out details of an economic bailout and called in his top generals to give them new marching orders .
His staff was already putting into effect executive orders to usher in the Obama presidency , as well as his request that military hearings for terror suspects at the Guantanamo prison be suspended for 120 days .
But at a staff meeting to swear in top aides , Obama dropped a bombshell .
He was freezing their salaries .
" During this period of economic emergency , families are tightening their belts , and so should Washington , " Obama told the assembled staff .
He thanked the staff for accepting the restriction and said , " It 's a mark of your commitment to public service . "
The president said the salaries of everyone on the White House staff that exceeded $ 100,000 would be frozen .
If the Obama White House pay structure is similar to that of the Bush White House , more than 100 staffers will have six - figure salaries .
Obama went on to spell out restrictions on lobbying after employees leave the White House and vowed that the federal government would be more willing to make information public .
The president said he was issuing the " rules of the road of my administration " to " make government more trustworthy in the eyes of the American people . "
" There is too much secrecy in this city , " he said .
" That era is now over ...
Information will not be withheld just because I say so . "
The adrenaline of taking over the Oval Office must have kicked in , because despite Tuesday 's grueling pageant of ceremonies in the numbing cold , and dancing at 10 inaugural balls until 12:55 a.m. , the lights snapped on in the residential quarters of the White House before dawn today .
Obama entered the Oval Office for his first day of work at 8:35 a.m. and got to spend 10 minutes alone before the demands of the nation began to demand his attention , White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said .
During that time , he read a note left to him by former president George Bush that was addressed , " To # 44 , From # 43 . "
By tradition , notes from the departing president to the incoming president remain secret .
Then the work began .
At 8:45 a.m. Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel entered to discuss the day 's busy list of events , and by 9:10 a.m. , first lady Michelle Obama joined her husband in the Oval Office .
Obama dove into the thorny Middle East right away , placing phone calls to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmrt , Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas , Jordan 's King Abdullah , and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak .
Also demanding his immediate attention are Senate confirmation proceedings today for two key Cabinet posts , Secretary of State - designate Hillary Clinton and Treasury Secretary - designate Timothy Geithner .
In between , Obama attended a National Prayer Service at the National Cathedral , sharing a pew with Vice President Joe Biden and his wife , along with former President Bill Clinton and future secretary of state Hillary Clinton .
During the afternoon , Obama hosted an open house of his new home , telling visitors to roam around , just do n't break anything .
Even during the balls on Tuesday night , Obama was plotting his first steps today .
" Starting tomorrow , we 'll be making a series of announcements both on domestic and foreign policy that I think will be critical for us to act swiftly on , " he told " Good Morning America 's " Robin Roberts at the Neighborhood Ball .
" We 're not going to be able to delay . "
As Obama charged through the long and emotional day Tuesday -- from attending a private church service in the morning to delivering his inaugural address to dancing well past midnight -- much of his staff got right to work .
Just hours after Obama took the oath of office , Emanuel sent a memorandum to federal agencies and departments , calling for them to halt pending regulations until the Obama administration reviewed them .
Top Priority Is Faltering Economy
The new president 's biggest priority will be reviving the faltering economy , and that includes hammering out with Congress the details of a massive $ 825 billion bailout .
" They want to have a complete overhaul of this financial - rescue package within days , " said ABC News ' chief Washington correspondent George Stephanopoulos .
Obama will meet with senior economic advisers in the afternoon to discuss the stimulus package as well as the $ 350 billion in Troubled Asset Relief Funds that Congress approved at his request last week to stabilize the financial markets .
To underline the urgency of devising an economic plan , the stock market took its biggest ever inauguration day plunge Tuesday , with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping 330 points , and today 's headlines warned of a worsening bank crisis .
Iraq is also high on the Day One agenda .
In the late afternoon , Obama will meet with his top generals , including Defense Secretary Robert Gates , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm .
Mike Mullen , National Security Adviser Gen. Jim Jones ( Ret. ) and Gen. David Petraeus , who heads the U.S. Central Command .
Joining the meeting via teleconference from Iraq will be U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker and Gen. Ray Odierno , the top ranking U.S. general in Iraq .
It 's not clear whether Clinton will be confirmed as secretary of state in time to sit in on the session .
Obama will be briefed on the status of military operations , and he will command the team to begin making plans to withdraw all U.S. combat troops from Iraq within 16 months .
An exhibition of new work by designer Sebastian Brajkovic opens at the Carpenters Workshop Gallery in London today .
Called Lathe , the collection comprises furniture pieces that appear to have been stretched or extruded .
" This extruding idea came from a Photoshop function where you can pick a row of pixels and extend them as long as you want , " explains Brajkovic .
Here 's some more information from Carpenters Workshop Gallery :

SEBASTIAN BRAJKOVIC
5 February - 14 March 2009
Carpenters Workshop Gallery is pleased to present Sebastian Brajkovic ’s highly anticipated new body of work , entitled Lathe .
Brajkovic ’s work strikes a fascinating balance between the old and the new .
His work is both highly contemporary , using computer technology to form composition , yet ingrained in history with its exquisite craftsmanship and traditional techniques .
His artistic process starts by deconstructing historical pieces of furniture , in particular seventeenth - century chairs , then through a combination of wood carving , bronze casting and hand embroidering , he reconstructs an entirely new vision .
His functional artworks are both a tribute to the past and a prelude to the future .
In the Lathe works , Brajkovic plays with his ’ sitters ’ subconscious comfort of the familiar , by taking traditional forms and techniques and subverting them with contemporary attitude .
‘ They are called ‘ Lathe ’ because of the apparent rotating effect of the design .
In fact the word Lathe comes from the Latin word used to convey the idea of milk being stirred .
My very first thought with making this design was actually a practical one .
I wanted to create more space on a singular chair by “ extruding ” the seat ’s surface area .
This extruding idea came from a Photoshop function where you can pick a row of pixels and extend them as long as you want .
This modern computer method aided me to devise new ways of sketching as a contradictory partner in my design process .
In this paradoxical sense , using antique forms was the next logical step . ’
Brajkovic uses form and composition like an artist ; the spinning composition he uses is comparable to the similarly computer - distortion inspired Vortex Paintings by contemporary artist David Salle , but the form is more likable to seventeenth - century furniture makers , bronze foundry artisans and traditional embroiderers .
Thus is the parody of Brajkovic 's work , it tells a story of contemporary society ’s need to reference the past , but present it in an idiosyncratically contemporary way .
He is drawn to the aesthetics of the past as a way of retaining our memories , but reveres the new , with its unknown and curious future .
Exhibition Highlights
Lathe I , Bronze , embroidered upholstery , Edition of 8 .
In Lathe I Brajkovic twists the familiar seventeenth - century dining chair and conjures up a playful alter reality , where objects themselves can be physically stretched and pulled as if in digital programme .
The Lathe I has been pierced by a central axis running through the profile of the chair back , and as though being turned on a giant lathe , the seat and back extend around offering up a new , more spacious seating arrangement .
With the seat extruded , the arms of the chair look like they might meet in reverse , the whole piece existing in the negative space of a traditional chair .
Lathe VIII , Bronze , embroidered upholstery , Edition of 8 .
Lathe VIII reworks the traditional concept of a loveseat .
Two antique chairs have been corrupted , fused together with the vision of modern technology , remade in traditional techniques , and now presenting an entirely new perspective on the conventional loveseat .
There is dynamism in this work , the chairs apparently turn around , pirouette , then spin off and trick the eye by giving the impression of a shift of movement or change of direction .
Like a sequence from The Matrix where the camera rotates around a scene that is frozen - in - time , when taking in the form a certain stillness pervades as you mentally navigate the distorted , alter - reality shape .
In 2008 the Lathe VIII won critics pick of the Design Art London Fair , and was acquired by the Victoria & Albert Museum for their permanent collection with sponsorship from Moet Hennesy .
It will also feature in the Telling Tales exhibition curated by Gareth Williams opening in June 2009 , which will focus on work by designers who explore the narrative potential of objects , connecting the past with the present .
Lathe Table , Aluminium , Edition of 8 .
Made of aluminium , the Lathe Table is quite literally created by being turned on a real lathe .
In this incarnation however , the chisel carves aluminum directly instead of the traditional wood .
The evocative sense of movement is conveyed in the spinning lines of the quasi vortex , offering the past impression of a moment of great movement and now stillness .
Inspired originally by a child ’s spinning top , whizzing around at high speed , it has the same illusion that once at its optimal speed it is no longer moving but standing up straight .
The highly polished surface is a product of the lathe turning technique which polishes as it carves the metal .
He explains that whereas the Lathe Chairs are more like painting , in that modifications can be made during the production process , the Lathe Table is a one step process which is an honest and direct application of the Lathe concept .
Lathe V , Bronze , embroidered upholstery , Edition of 8 .
In this work , modern techniques collide with classical shapes and an artisan use of materials .
The turning of the lathe is evident this time through the central axis of the seat , the rotation highlighted further with the pulled extended lines of the embroidery - almost comically - like movement in a cartoon sketch .
Again in a turn of wit , Brajkovic offers a view of the underside of the seat even though the viewer is standing up straight .
He bends perspective like a painter might , but in a three - dimensional way .
Born in 1975 , his mother is Dutch - Indonesian and his father Croatian - Italian .
He graduated from the esteemed Eindhoeven Design Academy in 2006 , where he could work within the fields of art and design simultaneously without categorization .
He studied under Gijs Bakker , Hella Jongerius and Jurgen Bey , carrying out an invaluable apprenticeship at the Juergen Bey Studio .
He continues to study philosophy at the University of Utrecht and lives and works in Amsterdam .
Sebastian Brajkovic exhibited at DesignArt London 2008 , Design Miami / Basel 2008 and Rossana Orlandi , Milan in 2007 .
The Commission on Wartime Contracting , created last year by Congress to scrutinize government contracts in Iraq and Afghanistan for waste , fraud and abuse , is holding its first hearing today in Washington .
The panel is kicking off with a headline act : Stuart Bowen , Jr. , who has served as the top government watchdog for Iraq reconstruction since 2004 .
Bowen is set to unveil a major report , " Hard Lessons : The Iraq Reconstruction Experience . "
( The full report is to be posted today at 10:00 a.m. on the Web site for the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction . )
This door - stopper of a report scrutinizes the approximately $ 44 billion that has been allocated so far for Iraq reconstruction – out of a total of $ 51 billion appropriated by Congress .
For anyone who has followed the issue , the conclusions are not surprising .
In advance interviews , Bowen estimated that around 15 percent – or $ 3 billion – of the $ 20 billion allocated for big - ticket reconstruction projects in Iraq had been wasted .
In a draft copy of the report that was leaked last year , Bowen recalled seeing bags of dollar bills literally being hauled out of the Republican Palace , headquarters of the Coalition Provisional Authority .
" What I saw was troubling : large amounts of cash moving quickly out the door , " he wrote .
" Later that same day , walking the halls of the palace , I overheard someone say : ' We ca n’t do that anymore .
There is a new inspector general here . '"
The colossal waste of taxpayer dollars in Iraq holds lessons for Afghanistan as well .
The new wartime contracting commission – inspired by the World War II - era Truman Committee – will be investigating Afghanistan projects for potential waste , fraud and abuse , and they 'll have their hands full .
As Secretary of Defense Robert Gates so diplomatically put it last week , coordination of aid and reconstruction to Afghanistan has been " less than stellar . "

KIEV , Ukraine  Latvia ’s center - right coalition government collapsed Friday , a victim of the country ’s growing economic and political turmoil .
It was the second European government , after Iceland , to disintegrate because of the international financial crisis .
The government in Riga , faced with forecasts of a severe drop in the economy this year , was the first in Eastern Europe to succumb to turmoil caused by the crisis .
Its collapse rounded out a week in which worries about feeble investment and output and shaky banks in Central and Eastern Europe coursed through international markets .
Latvia has had a history of revolving - door politics and complex coalitions since pulling free of the Soviet Union in 1991 .
Prime Minister Ivars Godmanis , who presented his resignation to President Valdis Zatlers on Friday , had been in power only since December 2007 .
But the precipitous plunge of Latvia ’s economy , which helped provoke riots last month that were the country ’s worst since 1991 , played a major part in the government ’s downfall .
Mr. Godmanis said he would continue to govern until a new coalition was formed .
His departure comes at a critical juncture for Latvia , a country of 2.2 million people .
After entering the European Union in 2004 , Latvia and its neighbors Estonia and Lithuania posted Europe ’s highest growth figures , earning the moniker the Baltic Tigers .
Now Latvia shows the Continent ’s biggest losses .
Crude oil prices have fallen below $ 34 a barrel , hitting the lowest price of the year .
Yet gasoline prices at the pump have risen nearly 10 percent in the past month .
The national average will likely hit $ 2 a gallon again this weekend , analysts say .
How can oil prices keep falling and pump prices keep rising ?
First of all , an oil supply glut has as much to do with low oil prices as the fall in demand , says Houston - based energy analyst Andy Lipow .
The U.S. benchmark for oil prices is largely set by the supply and demand balance in the little town of Cushing , Okla . — where Lipow says supplies have shot up 142 percent in four months .
On the other hand , gasoline supplies are tightening — now below where they were a year ago — as refiners have cut back on production due to slow demand .
The result has been a surge in wholesale gasoline prices , which really determine retail prices more so than crude oil .
" Add 60 cents a gallon to the wholesale gasoline price ( for freight , taxes and retailer mark up ) and you get pretty close to the retail price , " says Tom Kloza of the Oil Price Information Service .
While oil prices have plunged 24 percent so far this year , wholesale gasoline prices have surged 25 percent .
And that , analysts say , is a big reason why prices at the pump keep rising .
I 've sat in a room with Joaquin Phoenix , smelled his cigarette smoke and seen through the dark shades to the once - familiar eyes underneath .
And no , I still have no idea what the hell is going on with him .
But , and I swear I 'm not just saying this because I might wind up in his documentary , I 'm convinced he 's not a hoax .
Surely you 've heard about it all by now -- the slurred red carpet announcement that he was done acting , the messy Las Vegas rap debut , and especially last night 's disastrous Letterman appearance .
Joaquin Phoenix 's career has taken a sharp left turn , to a place that apparently bans razors and combs and considers a rap career a perfectly viable option for a white , Oscar - nominated actor raised by hippies .
Yesterday my online colleagues and I were gathered for the junket forthe movie that Phoenix is ostensibly out promoting .
What you saw on Letterman is essentially what we got-- a shambling , mumbling cipher , masked by sunglasses and facial hair , who showed no real interest in talking about the movie he was being paid to promote .
It 's unfair to accuse him of drug use , but it 's a fair guess that some were involved .
Because Casey Affleck and his crew were there filming the interview for the documentary about Phoenix 's new career , we indulged him in his desire to talk about rapping , and maybe because of that , we got more out of him than Letterman did .
He was talkative , almost friendly , admitting he 's planning to collaborate with Diddy and talking about his plans for dance songs , even " sexy songs , " on his rap album .
He mentioned how much he hates promoting films , which we had pretty much guessed , but also trashed acting in general , saying that talking about your emotional connection to your character is just something you say " when you 're trying to get nominated .
"
The only bit of that open disdain he showed Letterman -- and Letterman shoved right back at him -- came when one reporter dared to ask the question on everyone 's mind : basically , " Is this a put on ? "
Phoenix acted as if he'd been slapped , as if he had n't heard the question in dozens of interviews already .
" It 's hard not to get offended , " he responded , as if his dedication to rap throughout his life should be enough evidence that this is all for real .
And while he seemed to shrug it off , and the interview proceeded however bizarrely from there , Affleck jumped in at the end , telling the reporter she was so busy being " savvy " that she was n't able to accept the honesty behind it ( at least , I think that 's what he was going for ) .
I 'm not sure who 's drinking the Kool - Aid and who 's serving it , but neither man seems capable of understanding the main reaction this whole rap career has gotten : total skepticism ..
The junket proceeded from there , and we talked todirector James Gray and co-star Vinessa Shaw , both of whom seemed baffled but otherwise unwilling to talk about Phoenix 's behavior .
Just when we thought it was OK to go , an hour after we 'd expected thanks to Phoenix 's late arrival , Casey Affleck came back in , sat us back down , and asked us to explain just why we did n't believe that his brother - in - law Joaquin was being anything less than genuine .
Where to begin , right ?
Casey listened attentively as the eight or so journalists left tried to make our case , citing everything from Joaquin 's weird appearance and slurred speech to the checkered history of white rappers .
But at no point did he seem to drop his position that we were the crazy ones , that people change careers all the time and Joaquin 's rap career is no less unbelievable than , say , Scarlett Johansson dropping an album .
Why could n't we just be happy for him and let him do his thing ?
Have n't we ourselves ever wanted to do something different ?
( To prove this point , he actually went around the room and had us list all the jobs we 've had before , and what we really want to be doing ) .
But amid the genuine dismay he seemed to have at our cynical questions , Casey gave an explanation that may have cracked the case .
He blamed reality TV for our conception that everything has to be 100 % fake or 100 % real -- " there 's a million shades of gray in - between . "
And that , more than anything seems to be the answer we 're looking for .
Joaquin Phoenix really does want to be a rapper , but he also really wants the attention that comes from appearing to have a breakdown in public .
I told Casey that I was skeptical of how publicized the whole thing is , how Joaquin announced his retirement on the red carpet , rapped in Vegas for the first time only weeks later , and now has a documentary crew following him , assuring that we 'll be hearing about MC JP or whatever for at least the next year .
But given that Joaquin has willingly participated in the publicity tour for , all while barely talking about the movie itself , the publicity seems to be what it 's all about .
If he had cut an album in the privacy of his home and told us about it six months later , that would be beside the point .
It 's about the rapping , but it 's also about subverting every expectation we have of the stern - jawed , Oscar - nominated actor .
So is it a stunt , or is it for real ?
As Casey hinted , it 's a little bit of both .
Joaquin Phoenix is never going to " break character , " or admit the rapping was all a hoax , because it 's not .
Phoenix really does want to be a rapper , but who knows if it 's because that 's his lifelong artistic dream , or because it 's the last thing we would have expected .
The rapping , the beard , the Casey Affleck documentary -- it 's all part of a package telling us " You think you know Joaquin Phoenix , but you have no fucking idea .
" I was exhausted at the end of the day , slightly in shock that I 'd spent the last hour being grilled by Casey Affleck , and more sure than ever that , whatever else is going on , we 're not being punk'd by Joaquin Phoenix .
Whether it 's drugs talking , or an actual nervous breakdown , or a Britney - esque desire to distance himself as much as possible from his matinee idol potential , Phoenix feels everything he 's doing as genuinely as we might have thought he felt his characters in his movies .
Acting is n't really him , he told us , but this -- whatever this is -- is real .
For lack of a better option , I choose to believe him .
It appears an instructor has recorded the best incidents with young recruits over a long time and put it together for us to enjoy .

A couple of days ago I released version 1.0.8a of the JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit , that introduces some API changes and nice features .
This version focus mainly on two things :
I 'm quite happy with this version of the library , since it implements all lasting features in my TODO list .
This does n't mean much for the library , since I 'm still having lots of ideas for next releases , but at least I finished something I put up to and that makes me happy :) .
I implemented a new Canvas class , focusing on performance and usability .
The Canvas class is more like a Canvas Widget , since it creates a cross - browser canvas tag and a label div container , wrapped in a main div element .
This way , labels are relative to the canvas element and not absolute positioned , like they were on previous versions .
I 'd like to thank the people in this thread for providing nice ideas for implementing the Canvas class .
This canvas class makes also the Spacetree visualization cross browser , working perfectly well in IE6 +.
Prior to version 1.0.8a , you had to put a canvas tag and a div label container in your html to create a new visualization .
From version 1.0.8a this is no longer needed : you just have to include a visualization div container , like this :
A simple canvas instantiation could be something like this :
The first parameter in the canvas constructor is the id of the canvas widget .
This id will be the main wrapper div id , and it will serve as prefix for the ids of the other DOM elements created .
The second parameter is a canvas configuration object .
Some of the object 's properties are :
The html generated by this call will be appended in the div container ( # infovis ) previously defined : Notice how the Canvas id is used as the id of the main div container and also as prefix for the actual canvas element and the div label container element .
If we were using the Spacetree in IE , we could use an extra backgroundColor parameter as IE hack , since excanvas does not support clipping paths , which are used by the Spacetree visualization :
We can define also a background Canvas .
Take for example the RGraph example , in which we plot concentric circles as background for the visualization .
Prior to version 1.0.8a , the background was rendered at each frame , since at each frame of an animation the canvas is fully cleared to plot the graph 's next position .
This was n't very good for performance .
Defining a background canvas was the sanest choice .
That way the background is rendered only once :
The background canvas created will have mycanvas - bkcanvas as id .
For more information about the canvas class you can check its object reference , the examples provided with the library and the updated quick tutorials which you can find in the documentation I implemented the Strip layout for the Treemap , in addition to the Squarified and Slice and Dice layout algorithms provided in previous versions of the library .
I updated the treemap example to impement different tiling algorithms .
Use the dropdown box at the left of the screen to change the current layout .
Why another tiling algorithm ?
Well , as the Wikipedia explains :
To create a treemap , one must define a tiling algorithm , that is , a way to divide a rectangle into sub-rectangles of specified areas .
Ideally , a treemap algorithm would create rectangles of aspect ratio close to one ; would preserve some sense of the ordering of input data ; and would change only slowly when the underlying data changes slowly .
Unfortunately , these properties have an inverse relationship .
The Strip tiling algorithm provides a good compromise between order , stability and aspect ratio values .
More precisely , the three techniques implemented in the JIT can be classified as follows :
So the Strip algorithm is a good complement to the tiling algorithms provided .
I implemented two new layouts for the Spacetree , bottom and right layouts .
You can change the Spacetree layouts by using the dropdown box at the left of the visualization .
The bottom layout could be pretty useful for making family trees or things like that :) .
Anyway , another good thing of the Spacetree is that it works for IE6 + now ( thanks to the new Canvas implementation ) .
Some cleanup regarding the plotting algorithms and how labels were created was done , please check the ST quick tutorial to understand exactly what changed .
I implemented the second animation constraint mentioned in the RGraph paper : .
This constraint decreases edge crossing during animations , making animations more intuitive and graspable by the viewer .
The child ordering constraint consists in mantaining child ordering for the parent of the clicked node , that way we can decrease the edge crossing cases during animations : I did n't make a new example for this , but you should see the difference when comparing it with the examples packaged in previous versions of the library I did some Cleanup of the Hypertree code , and stripped off the Mouse class and the prepareCanvasEvents method .
Those kind of things can be easily implemented with DOM / AJAX frameworks like Mootools or JQuery .
The hypertree example packaged with the library shows a possible workaround for prepareCanvasEvents :
Anyway , that 's all for now .
Please feel free to file bugs if you spot one .
Remember also that the main project page has links to documentation , google groups , browser support , updated examples and some other things :)
Users of the growingly popular Boxee media platform will no longer have access to Hulu , after the Fox / NBC JV decided that letting people watch programs for free where they want was n’t part of the game plan .
Hulu did n’t elaborate on the reasons behind the move , saying only in a post that
Our content providers requested that we turn off access to our content via the Boxee product , and we are respecting their wishes .
While we stubbornly believe in this brave new world of media convergence — bumps and all — we are also steadfast in our belief that the best way to achieve our ambitious , never - ending mission of making media easier for users is to work hand in hand with content owners .
Without their content , none of what Hulu does would be possible , including providing you content via Hulu.com and our many distribution partner websites .
The real reason though comes back to the threat Boxee represents .
In a tight market where cable subscriptions are heading down and TV networks are bleeding advertisers , services such as Boxee offer TV or cable like convenience without the same costs , and likewise the revenue streams expected by old media .
Boxee was too much of a substitute for Fox and NBC to handle , and in taking one step forward with Hulu itself , and now taking two steps back by locking up that content by restricting where it can be played .
The net result is easy to predict .
More piracy of content , and NBC and Fox lose even more .
A short sighted decision from myopic media companies .

Donatella Rovera of Amnesty has been investigating Israel 's weapons use
The BBC News Website looks at case studies of some of the weapons and tactics used in the recent Gaza conflict that human rights groups are concerned may have been violations of international law .
Interviews by Aleem Maqbool and Heather Sharp in Gaza City .
GENERAL ALLEGATIONS
Human rights investigators have been trawling through the rubble in Gaza and gathering testimonies in an attempt to piece together a picture of the way both sides fought and the weapons they used .
International law demands that a distinction is made between combatants and non-combatants , and civilian casualties proportionate to the military gains from the attack in which they occurred .
But Amnesty International has concluded that some Israeli attacks " were directed at civilians or civilian buildings " , while " others were disproportionate or indiscriminate " .
Amnesty has dubbed Israel 's use of white phosphorus as a war crime
As well as the way Israeli forces used white phosphorous in the conflict , which Amnesty has dubbed a war crime , the organisation has also raised concerns about other weapons and their use .
These range from the firing of high explosive artillery shells , which have a large margin of error , in populated areas , to concerns that Israeli forces were trigger - happy in their use of more precise weapons such as tank shells .
There has never been any doubt that Palestinian militants ' use of rockets to target civilians in southern Israel was a violation of international humanitarian law .
Human rights investigators are also certain that the militant groups operated from civilian areas , although Amnesty and HRW are yet to publish detailed reports on the issue .
" The testimony and forensic evidence clearly shows Hamas was endangering the civilian population with its tactics , " says Marc Garlasco , a senior researcher and military specialist with Human Rights Watch .
The violations of one side do not allow the other side to fight in an illegal manner
Marc Garlasco , Human Rights Watch
He says there were cases of Hamas firing from abandoned Palestinian homes .
" I myself saw Qassam rockets rise up from populated areas , likely fired from between homes , " he adds .
Israel says the blame for civilian casualties lies with Hamas for using such tactics .
But Mr Garlasco - echoing the views of several other human rights groups - says this " in no way justifies what Israel did " .
" The violations of one side do not allow the other side to fight in an illegal manner . "
Israel has not yet responded to the specific allegations , but says it acts to minimise civilian casualties , and that its interpretation of international law is in line with that of other Western nations .
The Israeli military also says it is conducting internal investigations into some of the claims and individual cases , including regarding the use of white phosphorous , that rights groups have raised .
Back to the top FLECHETTE SHELLS Muhammad Abu Jarad still has a flechette lodged close to his spine Flechette shells contain several thousand razor - sharp , nail - like metal darts , each about 4 cm long .
The shells explode in the air scattering the darts over the surrounding area - in a cone - shaped pattern 300 m long and 90 m wide , according to Human Rights Watch .
They are not banned under international law , but human rights groups say their indiscriminate nature makes them illegal if used in built - up civilian areas such as the densely populated Gaza Strip .
Although they were not widely used by Israeli forces in the Gaza conflict , Amnesty International has documented several incidents and says their use " contributed to unlawful killings " of Palestinian civilians .
The black darts can still be seen in the walls above the spot where Wafa Abu Jarad , aged 21 and three months pregnant , was fatally injured on 5 January 2009 , outside their home on a residential street near Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza .
Her husband Muhammad , 24 , said they had just had breakfast on the steps of their home , with their two - year - old son Khalil , and were walking among the lemon trees in their garden when they heard an explosion a few blocks away .
As they ran for cover in the house , Wafa with Khalil in her arms , there was another explosion above them .
" All we could see were nails , " said Muhammad , in reference to the flechettes .
" We were both thrown to the ground .
She was bleeding from her head and chest , " he said .
" She fell unconscious immediately . "
Young Khalil Abu Jarad has not yet been told his mother died in the attack
Flechettes hit Khalil in the legs , Muhammad in the leg and back , and flew through the open door hitting Muhammad 's father in the shoulder , he said .
Wafa died in hospital three days later .
The clean white line of a flechette can be seen close to a vertebrae on an X - ray of Muhammad 's back .
He says he cannot sleep because of the pain , and sometimes finds his right side temporarily paralysed .
" The doctors are afraid to take it out , it is too close to the nerve - they are afraid I could be completely paralysed , " he says , as Khalil clings to his leg and breaks briefly into a howl .
" What can I tell him when he cries ' Mummy , Mummy ' ? " , he asks .
" Where am I supposed to bring his Mum from ? "
He tells the toddler Wafa is " travelling " .
" But yesterday he picked up a picture of her , and was saying ' Mummy , Mummy ' and kissing it .
He said she had been hurt in the explosion . "
In similar cases , Amnesty International has documented the death of a 16 - year - old boy , another woman and a paramedic , and numerous more injuries .
Israel has used flechette shells in Gaza for several years .
In 2003 Israel 's High Court rejected a petition to ban their use , saying it considered the military 's guidelines on their use to be adequate .
Back to the top TANK SHELLS
The Amnesty report says " tank rounds are precision munitions " .
" The killing of so many civilians , many in their homes , indicates that these munitions were , at best , used in a reckless or indiscriminate manner , " says the report .
Haider al - Eiwa cannot understand why his house was hit Human Rights Watch military analysts say tank shells are so accurate they can be fired into a window from a distance of a mile ( 1.6 km ) .
Both Amnesty and HRW investigators say there appeared to be a consistent pattern of Palestinian families being killed by Israeli tank shells fired into their homes , apparently as they approached windows or stepped on to balconies .
Haider al - Eiwa , 42 , walks through the ruins of his family 's top floor apartment in the eastern part of Gaza City .
Everything in the living room , dining room and kitchen has been reduced to a mangled , dusty mess .
A few weeks ago , he says , four of his children , aged between seven and 13 , were playing by the kitchen window , looking out towards the Israeli border .
KEY STORIES

Who is a civilian ?
He says that , without warning , a tank shell crashed straight through the same window , killing his wife , and all four children .
" Of course they played near the windows , they are children , " Haider says .
" And the tanks were well over a kilometre away .
" They have destroyed my life .
Why did they choose my house ? " he says .
" I am not Hamas , I do n't belong to any group .
They must have known there were children here . "
Marc Garlasco of Human Rights
Watch says : " I saw dozens upon dozens of homes damaged or destroyed by tank fire and our investigation noted numerous civilians killed in these cases . "
" Though we do n't know why they were killed , the Israeli army may have thought they were spotters for Hamas , " says Mr Garlasco .
It seems that in some cases , Israeli forces were " looking through the vision system , firing at anything they saw moving " , says Donatella Rovera of Amnesty International .
In another such case , cited by Amnesty , the house of Dr Izz al - Din Abu al - Eish was hit .
A tank shell was fired into his daughters ' bedroom .
Three of his daughters and his niece were killed .
Back to the top DRONE MISSILES Unmanned drones ( one visible , top right ) were used extensively by Israel over Gaza
Marc Garlasco of HRW says there is concern about the number of Palestinian civilians killed by missiles fired from unmanned Israeli aircraft , or drones , particularly because these can be precisely targeted and guided by an operator using imaging " like a TV camera " as they home in on their target .
In several cases , children were killed as they played on roofs , despite the fact that the operator should have been able to determine they were civilians and steer the missile away , he says .
" It appears there was this wider policy to kill anyone on a roof , " he said .
Furthermore , investigators found that many of the missiles used in such strikes contained tiny , sharp - edged cubes of purpose - made shrapnel , which are scattered as the missile explodes .
Mr Garlasco says these were designed as anti-tank weapons , but are often used by Israel for targeted killings , as they " do they job well " - the blast is confined to a small radius , the missiles are relatively light and can be mounted on unmanned drones .
Mahmoud al - Habbash says he cannot remember the blast that " sucked " him Mahmoud al - Habbash , 15 , shows us the spot on a rooftop where his cousins were killed by a guided missile .
According to HRW , the missile contained such cube - shaped shrapnel .
" We were feeding the chickens and playing , " he says .
" We did it every day and did not think we had any reason to be afraid . "
" I looked to the sky and I saw a flame coming towards us and I shouted and ran .
It was strange , I was suddenly sucked back forcefully , but I do n't even remember hearing the blast , " says Mahmoud .
" Shada , who was 12 and Isra who was 10 were killed .
Jamila lost both legs , she is 14 .
Muhammad who is 16 lost one leg .
Muhammad says when the explosion happened , it looked like there was a huge cloud of flies around us . "
Qusai al - Habbash , 48 , a science teacher and the father of the two girls who died , says the area had been calm and that families along the street had been going about their business as normal .
" Still , I thought of warning my children not to go outside , because of what was happening in other areas , " he says .
" But then I told myself that the Israeli weapons were very sophisticated .
They can easily see who is a child and who is a militant .
But they killed my children anyway . "
Amnesty has listed many cases in which civilians were killed in this manner , including eight secondary school students who were waiting for the school bus to take them home Back to the top

The disconnect is everywhere now .
Republicans and right - wing bloggers think they ’ve shown the Obama Administration what ’s what .
For example , Kathleen Parker seems to think President Obama has been bested by Rush Limbaugh —
Obama was cool even when , at that same GOP meeting , he urged Republicans to stop listening to Rush Limbaugh .
No anger , just angst .
“ You ca n’t just listen to Rush Limbaugh and get things done . ”
Excuse me , Mr. President , but you ’ve been baited by none other than the Master Fisherman .
Limbaugh tossed you a lure and you chomped .
… the backfire Obama felt in West Virginia was a gentle zephyr compared to the blowback that can be bellowed by El Rushbo .
Sure he can bellow , but does anyone care ?
In the past several months we ’ve seen over and over again that what Rush bellows does not move public opinion by so much as a hair .
Steve Elman and Alan Tolz wrote in the Boston Globe ( November 8 , 2008 ) ,
Consider some of the major stumbles this year by the medium ’s 800 - pound gorilla .
Rush Limbaugh vigorously promoted three separate political objectives over the past year , all of which failed : derailing John McCain ’s quest for the Republican nomination , sabotaging Barack Obama ’s drive for the Democratic nomination by fomenting Republican crossover votes for Hillary Clinton , and ultimately stopping Obama ’s march to victory in the general election . …
… New ears – even middle - aged or senior ears – are vital to talk radio’s influence because they are attached to brains that are available for persuasion , rather than brains that have already made a choice .
In other words , if Limbaugh and Michael Savage ( not to mention Rachel Maddow , Ed Schultz , and other more recent adventurers in talk ) fail to attract many new listeners , they end up talking only to those who agree with their opinions , and thus have a smaller chance to affect the ideas of the electorate in general .
The “ no new ears ” syndrome is haunting the entire Republican Party these days .
They are busily congratulating each other for sticking it to the Obama Administration this week .
As Nate Silver says , House Republicans in particular seem to be saying no just to say no .
I mean , what ’s with blocking a delay in the changeover to digital television ?
( BTW , the federal program set up by the previous administration to provide coupons for purchasing digital - to - analog converter boxes ran out of money several months ago . )
Eugene Robinson writes in the Washington Post that Republicans not only have no new ears ; the ears they have are n’t hearing much .
When not one single , solitary Republican vote can be found in the House of Representatives to support the president ’s $ 819 billion stimulus package , it ’s pretty clear that the GOP caucus has been meeting in a soundproof room .
See also Michael Tomasky , “ They Actually Think This ” and “ Boy , it ’s fun to kick these people while they ’re down ! ”
There has been criticism of Obama from the Left from people who think he should not have even attempted to negotiate with Republicans on the stimulus package .
But I think he was right to make a public show of meeting with them and offering concessions .
I think many people would like to see an end to petty partisan bickering .
So Obama reached out a hand and the Republicans bit it .
Did you catch that , America ?
Do you see who ’s at fault here ?
Kathleen Parker ( you really ought to read this column all the way through ; it ’s pathological ) tries to make the case that Obama is showing the same “ arrogance ” that Dubya showed early in his administration .
Parker actually writes ,
If Obama had a mandate at all , it was to heal the divisions that have plagued politics for so long .
No more partisan bickering , he promised , though there ’s only about a smirk ’s difference between Obama and Bush , stylistically .
While one is bring - ’em - on confrontational and the other a passive - aggressive Mr. Cool , both reveal a staggering sense of personal empowerment .
Ms. Parker , dear , what Obama is showing is voter empowerment , not personal empowerment .
Your side lost .
The American people want change , and your side is standing in the way .
Exactly what entitles you to do that ?
Regarding the family planning provision dropped from the stimulus bill — Katha Politt thinks Obama has betrayed women .
However , Steve Benen writes that the Obama Administration is committed to the family planning funds and intends to put the provision in another bill .
There was an impression in some circles that Obama ’s willingness to scuttle the family - planning funds was evidence of a lack of commitment on the issue .
For the president , however , it seems this was about when to advance funding on the issue , not whether .
Obama was n’t giving up on access to Medicaid - covered family planning services , he was just delaying it a little to help advance the stimulus plan .
Now that the House Republicans have demonstrated they want to be marginalized , I say they can be politely ignored from now on .

After being stranded for weeks , a monster botnet responsible for an estimated 40 percent of the world 's spam was able to briefly reconnect to its mothership in a tense international duel playing out online that could have a dramatic effect on the amount of junkmail flowing into inboxes everywhere .
The rogue network dubbed Srizbi was able to establish ties to a new master control channel using an emergency mechanism built into the 500,000 or so machines infected by the bot .
Botherders designed the pseudo random domain name generator in the event their network got disconnected from the previous channel .
That 's precisely what happened earlier this month , when a network provider known as McColo was yanked offline .
At time of writing , most of Srizbi 's connection to the outside world had once again been severed , thanks to decisive actions taken to shut down servers located in Estonia .
A single server located in Germany continued to host some nodes of the network , as researchers scrambled to get it shut down as well .
" An onslaught of spam was certainly averted , " said Alex Lanstein , a researcher at intrusion detection system prover FireEye , who has spent the past four weeks closely monitoring Srizbi .
" Estonia stepped in in record time and kicked these guys off line . "
According to Lanstein and other researchers at FireEye , computers infected by Srizbi are automatically armed with a mathematical algorithm that generates random - looking domain names that are invoked in the event their main channel is knocked out of commission .
The bots then endlessly cycle through a list of domains to contact until a connection is finally made .
( FireEye has a wealth of technical details about the domain name algorithm here . )
For weeks , the researchers were able to thwart the emergency backup measure by generating the domain names such as qpqduqud.com themselves and then snapping up the addresses ahead of the bad guys .
The cat - and - mouse standoff ended this week after FireEye researchers decided they could no longer afford to spend the money buying the domains .
Most of Srizbi's new command and control servers were located in Estonia and all of its domains were registered in Russia .
For about 13 hours , some 100,000 or so infected machines had the ability to connect to those servers , though it 's not clear exactly how many of them did so , since many of them were likely not powered on , Lanstein said .
The Estonian servers were quickly disconnected in a take - down action Lanstein said he was not at liberty to discuss in detail .
At time of writing , a single server located in Frankfurt continued to act as a command and control channel for the rogue network .
Since the shutdown of McColo , junk - mail levels have plummeted , according to anti-spam companies and anecdotal evidence .
Levels have gradually crept upward since then after a separate spam botnet dubbed Rustock , also orphaned by the McColo shutdown , was able to reboot itself last week .
Srizbi's resurrection had the potential to see spam levels spike to previous levels .
After successfully reconnecting to the new servers , infected machines immediately got back to the business of sending spam .
While the Estonian servers were active , botmasters updated templates for sending spam to Russian - speaking recipients , most likely as a way to test if the bots were still working .
The botmasters were stopped before they could do much else .
" If Estonia had n't taken it down I 'm sure they would have pushed out an English spam template and these things would have fired up again , but they did n't have time to , " Lanstein told The Register . ®
On my way to becoming a graphics developer at Wolfram Research , I took detours through degrees in design and architecture .
One of my enduring passions is exploring graphic design with programmatic and generative systems .
While some aspects of design require the skilled hand of the designer , others can be formalized and explored by computer .
For those tasks , Mathematica is an exceptional tool .
As starting points for design explorations , corporate logos are ideal .
They often distill a single idea into simplified geometric form that is straightforward to parameterize in Mathematica .
Once a logo is in Mathematica , exploring its parameter space quickly leads to the discovery of new graphic phenomena , emergent forms , unexpected relationships , and burgeoning lines of inquiry .
Mathematica ‘s very high - level programming and interface constructs help your explorations keep pace with your brain as it flings out new ideas left and right .
Take a logo as simple as the Mercedes - Benz star .
Just three points framed by a circle , its geometry is easily described in a few lines of Mathematica code , with some obvious parameters controlling the number of points on the star , the sharpness of the star ’s points , the thickness of the outer circle , and the orientation of the star .
With this Manipulate , you can explore the relative graphic weights of the star and circle , and the semantic import of the number of points on the star and its orientation .
( The early Daimler - Motoren - Gesellschaft in fact registered , but never used , a four - pointed version of the logo . )
But the real fun starts when you begin to explore the edges of the parameter space .
That ’s where you discover the unexpected .
Along the way I wondered what would happen if I added some twist to the star .
It took only seconds after the idea occurred to me for me to modify my Manipulate to accommodate it ( the modifications are shown in red below ) .
Mathematica ‘s code is extremely malleable , which is important if you do n’t want technical programming details slowing down your explorations .
With the modified Manipulate , encapsulated as the Demonstration “ Exploring the Mercedes - Benz Logo , ” I took off exploring the breadth of designs that its parameterization encompasses .
The diversity is astounding , including designs that suggest cinematography , folk art , heavy equipment , compass points , occult , and pharmacology .
Here is a series of snapshots from along the path of my exploration .
I was surprised that such a variety of designs would arise from a straightforward parameterization of this simple logo .
But that ’s often the case .
This tiny corner of the design universe contains an infinity within itself .
It ’s like exploring a drop of pond water with a microscope .
The universe within is dazzling .
Almost any graphic phenomenon of interest to designers can be explored with Mathematica .
Here ’s a logo by Franco Grignani for a special edition of a magazine .
Slight offsetting of the centers of a stack of black and white disks gives rise to an elegant 3D effect .
I parameterized the amount of offset as well as the number of rings and the inner disk radius , and added some twist and a control for dragging the point to which the disks converge .
You can see the result in the Demonstration “ Exploring a Logo by Grignani . ”
Once again , parameterizing this simple idea leads to a wealth of interesting phenomena .
The resulting designs range in character from bold woodcut to fine engraving to half - toned artwork .
Some logos are not so crisply geometric as the ones above , and graphics primitives alone do n’t suffice to realize them .
An example is the blurry Tate Gallery logo , which comes in many formal and color variations , one of which is approximated by the starting point of the Demonstration “ Exploring the Tate Logo ” shown below .
Here Mathematica ‘s image processing tools provide the functionality needed for exploring color relationships and edge hardness .
Mathematica ‘s image processing functions are sufficiently fast that the logo ’s blur can be explored interactively .
Color setters let you explore color relationships , while convenience controls for swapping and inverting colors make it easy to check the effectiveness of , say , a black - on - white design when it is used white - on - black .
I took advantage of Mathematica ‘s splines to explore variations of a design by the Norman Gorbaty and Ken Kirkwood Agency for Reyflex Textilien ( see the Demonstration “ Exploring the Reyflex Textilien Logo “ ) .
A bump in a series of vertical lines becomes progressively more pronounced , alluding to the process of weaving with flexible fibers .
My explorations with this Demonstration quickly departed from the bold graphic nature of the original logo .
I was fascinated by the shadings and three - dimensionality implied by variations in the spacings of fine lines , as well as by the shapes of the figure envelopes .
There ’s no reason to let yourself be constrained by the character of the starting point .
My final exploration has to do with fonts .
Graphic designers love fonts , and they love playing foreground / background games .
These ideas are combined in the Demonstration “ Reversed - Out Letterforms . ”
This is more than a one - off quickie demo , although it started out that way .
It ended up as a polished interface for designing letterform sequences , some of whose members are reversed out of the others .
Here is a snapshot of the Demonstration .
Sliders select characters and adjust inter-character spacings .
( It would be more natural to type the string into an InputField , but InputField s are not allowed in Demonstrations . )
The type of character overlap is controlled by a row of buttons : white on top , left to right , or right to left .
At the bottom of the controls are checkboxes for choosing display variants that help with precise character alignment and visualization of the white characters .
With fonts , design opportunities depend greatly on the geometries of the letterforms and the particular sequences of characters .
The regular geometry of the Braggadocio font works well in this “ acm ” logo .
The “ a ” ‘s disk nicely complements the reversed - out disk of the “ c , ” and the reversed - out bottom of the “ c ” echoes the curved negative spaces in the “ a ” and the “ m , ” unifying the design and giving it a pleasing rhythm .
For this “ ccc ” logo , I needed functionality that my Demonstration did n’t provide : I wanted to fill the counter — the interior space — of the middle “ c ” because the black of the final “ c ” alone was not sufficient to reveal its form .
With some systems this might have been a dead end , but Mathematica ‘s drawing tools work inside Manipulate as well as outside .
After I had adjusted the positions of the letterforms , I intervened by hand to draw an oval directly in the Demonstration graphic and move it behind the “ c ” to fill its counter .
This brings up a point worth emphasizing .
A parametric or generative design widget does not need to be a self - contained , complete design tool , any more than a camera needs to produce finished magazine covers .
It ’s part of a mix , and moving between programmatic generation and Illustrator or photocopier or scissors and glue enriches the design process .
Mathematica provides the import and export functionality to get material in and out conveniently .
In this Demonstration , Mathematica ‘s image processing functions came in handy in an unexpected way .
For effective reversed - out letters , you need bold , beefy , black fonts .
Lacy script - like letterforms do n’t provide enough black area to make a superimposed white letterform visible .
So for this Demonstration I wanted to weed out fonts from the font menu that were not likely to be effective .
Now think about how you would do that in Illustrator or your other favorite graphic design program .
There ’s really no alternative to scanning the fonts visually to pick out the black ones .
On my laptop , that would be 264 fonts to scan , and I have only the standard ones installed .
In Mathematica , of course , you can do it programmatically .
I wrote a short function that rasterizes a representative 48 - point character in a font ; turns the result into an image via Rasterize ; applies image processing functions to turn the image into just black and white pixels ( Binarize ) , eliminate white space around the letterform ( ImageCrop ) , and count the resulting numbers of black and white pixels ( ImageLevels ) ; and then returns the fraction of black pixels .
Here is that function .
Using that FontBlackness function , I sorted the fonts on my system from light to dark , as shown below .
In the Demonstration ’s font menu , I list only the fonts whose blackness is greater than .65 , and thus winnow down 264 potential fonts to a useful 32 .
With all of these Demonstrations , half the fun is seeing the designs in motion as they change , so visit the Wolfram Demonstrations Project and give them a whirl yourself .
Mathematica can be a surprisingly useful design partner , whether you ’re creating logos , doing design studies , or generating material to elaborate elsewhere .
Or , as I often am , just having fun .

Natto is a soybean product that is sticky , slimy and smelly , but it might be able to ward off Alzheimer ’s disease .
Once a theme ingredient on Iron Chef , natto contains an enzyme called nattokinase that can shred brain plaque , and chemists think it could become a game - changing medication .
In theory , the fermented soy substance would break up the deadly amyloid protein that forms fibrous deposits in the brains of Alzheimer ’s patients .
" The ability of nattokinase to degrade amyloid fibrils is quite promising , " says Li Gan , an Alzheimer ’s expert at the Gladstone Institute for Neurological Disease .
" Since the enzyme comes from a type of health food , it might have fewer side effects . "
There is no cure for Alzheimer ’s , a degenerative illness that affects more than
5 million people .
Some drugs can provide a modicum of relief for people who suffer from moderate memory loss .
But scientists need a better understanding of the disease , and a fresh strategy for treating it .
Chemist Rita Chen and her team at National Taiwan University showed that the soy enzyme can destroy three different types of toxic protein fibers .
In a recent report to the Journal of Food and Agricultural Chemistry , they wrote that the experimental medicine can reach many parts of the body when taken orally , but it might not be able to enter the brain — the place where Alzheimer ’s patients need it most .
But if the enzyme can work its magic in the brain , chemists will finally know how to undo the damage , rather than just treating the symptoms .
But chopping up the protein fibers might make things worse .
" Breaking down the fibrils may not always be beneficial , " says Gan .
" For example , if the fibrils are broken down to smaller , non-fibrillar aggregates , they could be even more toxic . "
For that reason , both Chen and Gan agree that it is time to test the enzyme on animals .
In the report , Chen pointed out that there may be an even simpler way to get some answers — an epidemiological study .
If people who eat a high natto diet have a lower risk of getting the disease , she could be on to something .
The jury is still out on whether nattokinase will become a blockbuster Alzheimer ’s drug .
But it is is readily available in the freezer section of Japanese markets and often served with rice , sushi or pork .
So you might want to develop a taste for the unusual food .
But that could take awhile .

Throughout the two - week bombardment of the Gaza Strip most journalists have been kept out by the Israeli government on the pretext of security .
And the Israelis are pleased with the results .
Foreign journalists have been forced to report without getting to the detail of what is going on .
That meant , at least in the early days of the bombardment , that reporters who would have been in Gaza were instead reporting from Israeli towns and cities under fire from Hamas , and Israeli officials found it easier to get themselves in front of a television camera .
An Israeli official told me they were delighted at a BBC TV correspondent broadcasting from Ashkelon in a flak jacket , reinforcing the impression that the Israeli city is a war zone when there is more chance of being hit by a car than a rocket .
The notable exception is al - Jazeera TV , which has a bureau in Gaza City and has been broadcasting live from there .
Danny Seaman , head of the Israeli government 's press office , who has described foreign journalists as a " figleaf " for Hamas , says the exclusion of reporters from Gaza has worked in Israel 's favour as it has forced a greater focus on Israel 's side of the story .
" When you have hundreds of journalists coming in , most have n't the faintest idea about the war or the situation , " he said .
" Take the UN school [ where 42 people were killed by an Israeli shell ] for example .
There 's a lot of questions as to what actually happened .
If the foreign media had been there it would have had much more of an impact on the conflict than it has at the moment .
For the first time , when Israel raised questions , journalists had to address these issues and not get caught in feeding frenzy of reporting the story . "
Israel has long accommodated an often critical foreign press corps , generally without interference , although hostility grew after the outbreak of the second intifada because journalists were perceived as pro-Palestinian .
The Israeli government boycotted the BBC at times and a cabinet minister wrote to the corporation to accuse its highly regarded former Jerusalem correspondent , Orla Guerin , of antisemitism .
The BBC has two Palestinian producers in Gaza who have supplied material .
But its Middle East editor , Jeremy Bowen , is among those unable to enter Gaza .
" We 've had coverage but of course it is not the coverage that we would have liked to have had because we would have preferred to have gone in ourselves , " he said .
Israel says there is no formal ban on reporters entering Gaza and that they are prevented only by the security situation .
But the government has failed to implement a high court order to let in reporters when the principal crossing is open .
Israel is not alone in this .
British forces restricted access by journalists to parts of Afghanistan because of government fears about public reaction to pictures of dead Afghans .
The US has manipulated coverage from Iraq , via the policy of embedding journalists with troops and discouraging " unilateral " reporters .
BBC man on the ground
Palestinian TV producer Rushdi Abu
Alouf has become the unlikely star of the BBC's Gaza coverage after Israel banned foreign correspondents entering the territory , preventing Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen from taking the helm .
Although unknown to most British viewers , Abu Alouf has worked for the BBC for more than five years and is a familiar voice on the BBC Arabic service .
His on - camera assurance is remarkable given that he has little previous broadcasting experience .
" He 's the unlikely star but in other ways he is the most obvious because he 's used to keeping things in Gaza running , " said the BBC 's world news editor , Jon Williams .

NEW YORK ( Money ) -- Question : I 'm retired and my 401( k ) has lost approximately 35 % over the past year .
My financial adviser tells me to stay the course , but the losses keep mounting .
What should I do ?
- Dale Marcos , Lafayette , Indiana
Answer :
For starters , you should demand a better answer from your financial adviser .
Just telling someone to " stay the course " is n't an adequate answer any time an investor expresses doubt or confusion about an investing or planning strategy , and it 's certainly not an acceptable reply given the virtually unprecedented turmoil and uncertainty we 're experiencing today .
You can't blame your adviser for not foreseeing the severity of this downturn before it occurred .
Nobody 's crystal ball is that clear .
But an adviser , or at least a good one , is supposed to help you create an investing strategy and retirement plan that can see you through a variety of economic and market scenarios .
Your adviser can't immunize you against losses altogether .
That would be unrealistic if you also want your retirement savings to grow and support you for the rest of your life .
But the plan should balance upside potential with some measure of downside protection that makes sense given your age , risk tolerance and your financial resources .
Most important , your adviser should be willing to get together with you in times like these to go over the plan , see if it 's working as expected and discuss whether or not it needs to be revised .
On the face of it , a 35 % decline over the past 12 months seems a bit much for someone who 's retired .
Given that stocks are down about 40 % over that period and the broad bond market is flat to slightly up , that suggests a stock allocation somewhere between 80 % and 90 % .
That strikes me as pretty risky for a retiree .
But without more information about your overall finances - like whether the decline you cite includes withdrawals , what other investments you own and how heavily you 'll be relying on your 401 ( k ) for living expenses - I can't say for sure whether your 401 ( k ) is invested too aggressively .
Ask for more transparency
Whatever the particulars of your situation , this much is clear :
You are upset about the performance of your account and you are n't getting enough feedback from your adviser to know whether the path he wants you to stay on is the right one .
Here 's what I recommend .
Go back to your adviser and explain that you need to know what course it is exactly that you are on and why you should stick to it .
I 'd ask to see how my portfolio is divvied up between stocks and bonds ( as well as among different types of stocks and bonds ) and I 'd want an explanation of why that allocation makes sense given today 's conditions .
I 'd also want to see some sort of analysis that shows how much income I can reasonably expect throughout retirement from my investments , Social Security and pensions , if any , and how that income compares to my projected living expenses .
Move on
If your adviser can't or wo n't do this , you have two choices .
You can take this kind of comprehensive look at your retirement finances on your own by revving up an online tool like Fidelity 's Retirement Income Planner or T. Rowe Price 's Retirement Income Calculator .
Or you can switch to an adviser who is willing to do this type of assessment for you .
If you do move on to another adviser , be careful .
There are lots of people with impressive - sounding credentials who really operate more as a salesman than financial adviser , looking to take advantage of fearful investors in uncertain times like these .
To find a reputable adviser , search the Financial Planning Association Web site or the Garrett Planning Network .
Who knows , maybe your adviser has already revisited the advice he or she gave to you and other clients and crunched the numbers again .
Perhaps that 's why your adviser can so confidently tell you to stay the course .
But if I were as worried as you seem to be , I 'd want more convincing ( and maybe a look at some alternatives ) before I went along .
Still wondering how you 'll afford to retire ?
Get the answers to all your questions about IRAs , 401 ( k ) s , Social Security , investing , taxes , pensions , annuities and more at our Ultimate Guide to Retirement .
Whether you 're starting out or are weeks away from your farewell party , you 'll find everything you need to know to prosper .

High - energy X - ray diffraction was used to pinpoint some 5 million atoms in the protective protein coat used by hundreds of viruses .
Credit : J. Pan & Y.J. Tao / Rice University
( PhysOrg.com ) --
If a picture is worth a thousand words , then Rice University 's precise new image of a virus ' protective coat is seriously undervalued .
More than three years in the making , the image contains some 5 million atoms -- each in precisely the right place -- and it could help scientists find better ways to both fight viral infections and design new gene therapies .
The stunning image , which appears online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , reveals the structure of a type of protein coat shared by hundreds of known viruses containing double - stranded RNA genomes .
The image was painstakingly created from hundreds of high - energy X - ray diffraction images and paints the clearest picture yet of the viruses ' genome - encasing shell called a " capsid . "
" When these viruses invade cells , the capsids get taken inside and never completely break apart , " said lead researcher Jane Tao , assistant professor of biochemistry and cell biology at Rice .
Capsids come into play because viruses can reproduce themselves only by invading a host cell and highjacking its biochemical machinery .
But when they invade , viruses need to seal off their genetic payload to prevent it from being destroyed by the cell 's protective mechanisms .
Though there are more than 5,000 known viruses , including whole families that are marked by wide variations in genetic payload and other characteristics , most of them use either a helical or a spherical capsid .
In their attempt to map precisely the spherical variety , Tao and lead author Junhua Pan , a postdoctoral fellow at Rice , first had to create a crystalline form of the capsid that could be X - rayed .
They chose the oft - studied Penicillium stoloniferum virus F , or PsV - F , a virus that infects the fungus that makes penicillin .
PsV - F uses the spherical capsid ; although it does not infect humans , it is similar to a rotavirus and others that do .
" Spherical viruses like this have symmetry like a soccer ball or geodesic dome , " Pan said .
" The whole capsid contains exactly 120 copies of a single protein . "
Previous studies had shown that spherical capsids contain dozens of copies of the capsid protein , or CP , in an interlocking arrangement .
The new research identified the sphere 's basic building block , a four - piece arrangement of CP molecules called a tetramer , which could also be building blocks for other viruses ' protein coats .
By deciphering both the arrangement and the basic building block , the research team hopes to learn more about the capsid - forming process .
" Because many viruses use this type of capsid , understanding how it forms could lead to new approaches for antiviral therapies , " Tao said .
" It could also aid researchers who are trying to create designer viruses and other tools that can deliver therapeutic genes into cells . "
The research team used X - ray crystallography to decipher the structure of the capsid .
Pan first spent several months creating hundreds of crystal samples of PsV - F .
He then collected hundreds of high - intensity , high - energy X - ray diffraction images at the Cornell High Energy Synchotron Source , or CHESS , in Ithaca , N.Y .
By analyzing the way the X - rays scattered when they struck the crystals , Pan and the team created a precise three - dimensional image of the spherical capsid .

The tests took place during Navy combined combat system ship qualification trials and also included SM - 2 Block IIIA , IIIB and Block III in various threat scenarios .
" These tests demonstrate the reliability and accuracy of SM - 2 as it continues to evolve , " Ron Shields , Raytheon Missile Systems Standard Missile program director , said in a statement .
" The SM - 2's ability to successfully employ this new target - detecting device against challenging targets enhances the missile 's usefulness to the war fighter . "
Malaysian identical twin brothers have escaped hanging for drug trafficking as a court failed to decide which brother was the criminal , and cleared both .
A judge in the capital , Kuala Lumpur , said the case was unique and she could not send the wrong person to his death .
In 2003 police arrested one brother found driving drugs to a house .
The second twin arrived soon afterwards and was also arrested .
Neither officers nor a DNA test could identify which twin owned the drugs .
Sathis and Sabarish Raj , 27 , cried in court when they heard the judge say that the prosecution had failed to prove which twin had been arrested first with a car containing 166kg of cannabis and almost 2 kg of raw opium .
According to the New Straits Times , the judge told the court : " I can't be calling the wrong twin to enter his defence .
I can't be sending the wrong person to the gallows . "
Execution is mandatory for convicted drugs traffickers in Malaysia .
David Beckham , Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo are among the big names of English football who will be asked to speak out against homophobia in a video to be screened at grounds , including Wembley , and in schools around the country , with the aim to " kick anti-gay prejudice off the pitch and out of the terraces " .
Peter Tatchell , of the gay rights group Outrage ! , has persuaded the Football Association and the Professional Footballers Association to guarantee around £ 20,000 of funding towards the project , and he said yesterday that he believes the video might also encourage some gay players to come out .
" I know of a group of gay footballers who would not feel comfortable coming out at the moment , " Tatchell said .
" This video might be the precursor to that happening , and if it 's well received , I suspect it will give some players the confidence to think about coming out . "
There have been a few openly gay football executives , most famously Elton John , and there is one openly gay FA Councillor , Peter Clayton , of the Middlesex FA .
But the only openly gay professional player in the British game in living memory was Justin Fashanu , who endured years of abuse about his sexuality before committing suicide in 1998 .
Tatchell approached the FA with the idea about an anti-homophobia video in the wake of anti-gay chants aimed at high - profile footballers including Sol Campbell and Ashley Cole .
An FA spokesman confirmed yesterday that the governing body , along with the PFA and Kick It Out , the anti-racist campaign , will fund the project , for which an advertising agency is being sought .
The video will be released later this year .
The FA will encourage its screening at grounds , including Wembley during England matches .
Tatchell praised the FA for backing the video .
He added : " The plan is to feature big - name stars speaking out against homophobia , in order to make anti-gay chants look as stupid , ignorant and uncool as racist ones .
" Our wish - list of participating football stars includes David Beckham , Cristiano Ronaldo , Rio Ferdinand , Peter Crouch , David James , Wayne Rooney , John Terry , Frank Lampard , Theo Walcott and Michael Owen .
" We 're pressing the FA to get this video broadcast on TV and at matches on the giant stadium screens .
We also want the FA to put it on YouTube and distribute copies to every school in the country . "

“ I am more concerned with the return of my money than the return on my money . ”
– Mark Twain
In the last two weeks , two federal interest rates hit all - time record lows .
On December 16 , the market was taken by surprise when Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke lowered the federal funds rate ( the interest banks pay to borrow the reserves they need to meet their reserve requirement ) to zero .
The explanation given was that the Federal Reserve was just setting the rate closer to where banks had already been trading with each other for weeks .
1
In an even more stunning development , the week before that the federal government itself began borrowing money for free .
“ We were all watching it agog , ” said a Treasury spokesman of the December 9 auction of three - month Treasury bills .
Investors were so hungry for Treasury debt that they were snatching up the T - bills at zero percent interest .
In the secondary market ( investors buying from each other ) , Treasuries were actually trading at a negative interest rate .
That meant buyers were paying more than they would get back when the Treasuries came due .
Even at these unprecedented rates of non-return , the Treasury was having trouble keeping up with the demand .
Four times as much money wanted in as was sought by the government , indicating much more demand than availability .
2
What is going on ?
The credit market remains so tight that state and local governments are being forced to pay interest rates as high as 20 percent .
Why is the debt of our insolvent federal government so much more desirable that investors are clamoring to buy it when the return is zero or even negative ?
The U.S. government is the most indebted nation in the world , with an official federal debt topping $ 10 trillion .
Everyone knows that this debt never can or will be paid off with taxpayer dollars , now or in the future .
Commentators have been warning for years that the federal debt would soon be so crippling that foreign investors would flee and the interest alone would be more than the taxpayers could pay .
Why are investors now rushing in to buy the U.S. government ’s exploding debt , even at a 0 % return ?
Would n’t their money be safer and more liquid tucked under the mattress or left in cash in the bank ?
Why Lend Money for Free ?
The explanation proffered by commentators is that mattresses are vulnerable to thieves ; and the U.S. government , though insolvent , is less likely to file for bankruptcy than either your local bank or your local government .
If your bank goes bankrupt , your money will become part of an FDIC receivership .
You may get it back eventually , but you could be doing without it for longer than you would like .
Another problem with cash , for investors who have a lot of it , is that it ca n’t be moved from place to place without reporting it ; and huge amounts of money are difficult to convert to currency , making it more convenient to just park the funds in Treasuries .
What makes the debt of the insolvent U.S. government less risky than that of state and local governments is that the federal government has the power to print its way out of any dollar deficiency .
Not that the Treasury actually prints Federal Reserve Notes ( dollar bills ) – the Federal Reserve does that – but the Treasury can always print more bonds , which the Federal Reserve can then be counted on to buy with new dollar bills ( or , more often , with new computer entries in bank accounts ) .
Something More Interesting than Interest ?
While that may all be true , it still does n’t seem to explain a sudden surge of interest in a potentially risky investment that generates zero profit .
Or could it be that the profit is coming in other ways than interest ?
For banks , U.S. Treasuries are highly sought after regardless of interest rate , because the securities are considered “ risk - free ” for purposes of meeting the “ risk - weighted ” capital requirement of the Bank for International Settlements .
Under the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) , banks can bolster their balance sheets by swapping T - bills for riskier “ toxic ” collateral , including those pesky derivatives that are messing up their books .
Banks are allowed to buy Treasuries with their “ excess reserves ” ( the amount by which the bank ’s deposits have not been leveraged by a factor of ten or so into new loans ) .
3
By putting these lendable funds into T - bills , the TARP recipients can remove them from the reach of riskier borrowers .
The fact that the Fed is now paying interest on the reserves that banks hold at the central bank could also factor into the equation .
4
Adding to the heavy demand for federal securities may be competition from the Federal Reserve itself .
On December 1 , 2008 , Chairman Bernanke announced that the Fed could soon be providing “ liquidity ” to the frozen credit market by buying “ longer - term Treasury and agency securities on the open market in substantial quantities .
” 5 For the Fed to buy U.S. Treasuries with money created on a printing press is actually nothing new .
The process is called “ open market operations ” and is how the Fed has always expanded the money supply .
But the Fed is now talking about “ substantial quantities , ” and today that could mean trillions .
The Los Angeles Times reported on November 30 that the loans , commitments and guarantees of the Treasury and the Fed together now come to $ 8.5 trillion .
6
That ’s roughly half the gross domestic product of the whole country ; yet Congress approved only $ 700 billion in its latest bailout excursion in October .
Where is the other $ 7 - plus trillion coming from ?

** UPDATE ** See our Danica Patrick Tattoo Update for the latest ** UPDATE **
Sports Illustrated apparently had Danica Patrick ’s tramp stamp photoshopped out of her recent photo spread in the Swimsuit issue .
While you may debate whether her ink should be considered a “ tramp stamp ” , since the tattoo is a relatively classy depiction of an American Flag being morphed into a checkered flag , the fact still remains that it is missing from the photos posted online .
I first noticed this while viewing the photo shoot video .
Compare the two images below ( left from Photo , right from Video )
Here are some additional photos of Danica , with and without the Tattoo .
In “ researching ” for this article , I came across this gem on Wikipedia .
Yah learn something every day .
In the United States , they have been pejoratively referred to as “ tramp stamps ” or “ California license plates ” in Australia , the Netherlands and Germany as “ arse antlers ” and in the UK as “ slag tags ” .
Beyond Danica ’s “ Arse Antlers ” , I ca n’t help but notice that she looks way hotter in this series of photos than I have ever seen her look before .
Looks like there may be some additional photoshop manipulation going on , the type that is way cheaper then surgery .
A little air brush here and there , and Danica certainly looks more like a model than a race car driver .
Our friends over at Busted Coverage recently noted that something similar happened with Brooklyn Decker ’s Calendar .
It is interesting that while Sports Illustrated was preparing for the Swimsuit Issue release , they were breaking the story on Alex Rodriguez and steroids .
Seems like Rodriguez is n’t the only thing that is n’t 100 % real , eh SI ?

Uncovering the mysteries of black holes
Exploring for Supermassive Black Holes – University of Leicester Ken Edwards Lecture Theatre 1 – Thursday 12th March , 5.30 - 7.00 pm
Issued on 13 February 2009
The discovery of massive Black Holes in the nuclei of many galaxies , including our own Milky Way , will be described at the University of Leicester on Thursday 12th March .
As part of the University ’s celebrations of National Science and Engineering Week , Emeritus Professor Ken Pounds , of the Department of Physics and Astronomy , will be speaking on “ Exploring for Supermassive Black Holes ” .
Many galaxies are seen to have a bright , star - like nucleus which , in extreme cases , can dominate the light of the host galaxy .
Observations by Leicester researchers with the Ariel 5 Satellite in the 1970s first showed that the nuclei in such ‘ active galaxies ’ are also powerful sources of X - radiation .
Subsequent observations with ever - more sensitive space - borne observatories have provided definitive evidence that matter falling onto a massive black hole is responsible for the enormous power of these active galactic nuclei ( AGN ) .
Within the past few years X - ray observations have revealed another important property of AGN , where an ' over - fed ' black hole will eject excess matter at relativistic speeds .
This discovery is now offering an insight into why the growth of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies appear to be closely linked .

“ The Siege of Leningrad , also known as The Leningrad Blockade was an unsuccessful military operation by the Axis ( Nazi ) powers to capture Leningrad ( now Saint Petersburg ) during World War II .
The siege lasted from September 9 , 1941 , to January 27 , 1944 , when a narrow land corridor to the city was established by the Soviets .
The total lifting of the siege occurred on January 27 , 1944 .
The Siege of Leningrad was one of the longest and most destructive sieges of major cities in modern history and it was the second most costly . ” – from Wikipedia .
During nine hundred (! ) days a few million people city of Leningrad suffered from cold and hunger , being deprived of almost all supplies of food and fuel .
Many thousands died , those who survived remember this not very willingly .
The situation with food was so heavy , no food was sold / distributed among people except a few grams ( not even tens or hundred grams ) of bread , and not each day , that people had to eat stuff that they would never eat in normal life , like making soups of leather boots ( because leather is of animal origin ) or boiling the wallpaper because the glue with which they were attached to walls contained a bit of organic stuff .
Of course many occasions of cannibalism occurred .
On those photos you can see some pieces of those old photos made during those black days overlaid to the modern city views , respecting the place and angle of view .

As we saw last time LG and CES have launched their watch phone , now its Samsung ’s turn .
Samsung is also going to production of stylish watch phone .
Samsung came to MWC this year may be in last month of 2009 .
Although they have still not open about their specification but it may be predicted that it may have a full touchscreen , Bluetooth , and a speakerphone .
‘ Course , in all likelihood , this is just another chapter in the book of Samsung heartbreak — it ’ll either never see production or get released by precisely one carrier in precisely one country , then promptly fade into oblivion — but it ’s looking awfully production - friendly .
" I am not saying I believe them and I do n't want to blacken the girl 's reputation , but we have to know for sure – for Alfie , for her and for that baby . "
As a highly paid consultant , Bruce did n't make a whole lot of friends with the " locals . "
Whenever his New York City - based systems - integration firm placed him at a client site , the in - house developers tended to resent him for one of two reasons :
They 'd either believe that he did n't bring nearly enough innovation to justify his company 's three - figure hourly bill rate ( " We could have thought of that , too " ) , or they 'd feel that he was far too much of an outsider to provide any valuable contributions to their team ( " We already know what 's best " ) .
Victor was no exception .
Almost immediately , it was obvious that Victor had come to the conclusion that bringing in any outside consultants would just delay things further .
Victor was all too familiar with delays :
In his role as lead developer at a government loan guarantor , he was personally responsible for a three - month delay in their new loan - underwriting system .
And then another three - month delay .
And then a year - long delay .
A Reasonable Delay
A short investigation revealed why .
Victor and crew were n't actually programming the loan - underwriting system .
Instead , they were busily writing an all - purpose " expert system " that could easily be " configured " by the business users to do exactly what they wanted .
And better yet , it was " practically done . "
Bruce started with his standard line of questions :
" Why not just use an off - the - shelf expert system ? "
" Oh , believe me , " Victor responded defensively .
" We looked and looked and looked .
There 's simply no off - the - shelf system that meets our needs . "
" Why did you decide on an expert system for this ? "
Victor smiled .
" I 'm a programmer .
I do n't need , nor do I want , to learn the business .
The business users can just tell the system what to do . "
Several days earlier , Bruce had spent a long time trying to learn all about the client 's loans , loan - underwriting and guarantor programs .
As he spoke with Victor , visions of incredibly complex workflow diagrams and business rules flew through his head .
Building a user - configurable system for all this seemed to be close to impossible .
" Can I see what you 've got so far ? "
Bruce asked .
" Well , no , " Victor said , furling his brow .
" It 's not done yet .
But I can show you the pre-alpha release . "
Victor fired up Visual Studio and ran the project .
After a few minutes of compiling , a window resembling Notepad popped up .
Victor began typing .
DECLARE LOAN_AMT AS MONEY .
DECLARE PAYOFF_MONTHS AS INTEGER .
DECLARE INTEREST AS PERCENT .
INPUT LOAN_AMT , PAYOFF_MONTHS , INTEREST ON FORM .
DECLARE PAYMENT AS MONEY .
SET PAYMENT = LOAN_AMT * INTEREST / PAYOFF_MONTHS .
OUTPUT PAYMENT ON FORM .
After Victor clicked the green triangle , another window popped up that had three fields : LOAN_AMOUNT , PAYOFF_MONTHS and INTEREST .
Typing in some values and clicking the OK button yielded another window with PAYMENT as a field .
" I do n't think that 's how you calculate interest , " Victor shrugged , " but you get the idea . "
Bruce certainly did get the idea .
They had spent nearly two years building a system that required the user to tell it exactly what they wanted it to do - all in a programming language that resembled a mix between COBOL and BASIC .
" The main thing that 's missing , " Victor added , " is reading and writing to a database .
It 's sort of a one - time use project for now . "
Adding Some More Use
Acting in his role as consultant , Bruce advised management of his findings .
Although they were committed to finishing Victor 's expert system -- and a little skeptical of an outside consultant 's opinion -- they were intrigued by Bruce 's " traditional " approach and wanted to see both approaches run in parallel .
Over the next few months , Victor 's team worked furiously to get their code to read information from a database .
It was n't able to save back to the database , but that particular functionality was " practically done . "
Bruce 's small team spent that time gathering the actual business requirements , designing a database , building an architecture and coding a basic prototype for a loan - underwriting system .
After seeing the results , management realized Bruce 's " traditional " approach was the way to go and immediately canceled all development on the expert system .
They directed Victor 's team to work on building the loan - underwriting system , and , eight months later , the new system went into production .
Victor did n't last that long , however .
When his boss initially broke the news about the expert system 's cancellation , Victor kicked and screamed for hours , appealing all the way up to the executive level .
Within a week , he resigned from his job in protest and encouraged his former teammates to follow suit .
No one did .

Debbie Wasserman Schultz on CNN's State of the Union responding to John King questioning her with the media 's latest talking points on bipartisanship and about what 's going to happen to the bill once it goes to conference committee .
She explains that Republicans refused the hand of bipartianship .
The only people surprised by that are the media .
KING : As you know , the new president came to town promising a new era of bipartisanship .
Eight years of George W. Bush , eight years of Bill Clinton , not much true bipartisanship in this town .
Your speaker after the Senate compromise was reached on Friday , made clear she does n't like it .
She said this , " Washington seems consumed in the process argument of the bipartisanship when the rest of the country says they need this bill . "
The process argument of bipartisanship .
The president said it is a critical spirit to have in this town .
Your boss in the House , the speaker , does n't seem to think it 's important .
SCHULTZ : On the contrary , Speaker Pelosi has made bipartisanship and reaching out in the Republicans in the House a priority .
We made sure that we had markup after markup in committee this week and in the last few weeks which included Republican amendments that we heard , that some that we accepted .
We reached out our hand across the aisle , asked them to help craft this legislation .
That was rejected .
So we have made an effort at reaching out our hand across the aisle .
They really seem to be more interested in making sure that this whole process fails .
It 's really baffling to me why they do n't want to pass an economic recovery package .
They 'll have to answer the American people as to why that is .
KING : 37 lawmakers , critics and analysts have made the rounds this morning on the Sunday talk shows .
Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida , she gets the last word .
Thank you for joining us here .
If you listen to the debate this morning , people look at this compromise the Senate brokered Friday and they say the only way to keep it intact and get a bill to President Obama by the end of this coming week is to keep that number .
As you know , your speaker , many other Democrats in the House say , no .
No , we do n't like this bill .
I think the speaker used the term violent , did violence to what you 're trying to accomplish in the House .
So will you come back in the House this week and say we 're putting the money back in ?
SCHULTZ : What we 're going to come back in the House this week and do is make sure that we can apply the tourniquet to the gash that has been busted open in the economy after eight years of Republican applied leeches .
At the end of the day , the front page of " The Washington Post " said agree speed matters more than size and shape .
And we 're going through the normal legislative process , the give and take , and ensure that we can invest in our nation 's infrastructure .
KING : But if speed matters more than size or shape , to use the headline you just read , why does n't the House say you know what , we do n't like this , we thought ours was better , but we will accept it because then we can get a bill to the president on Wednesday or Thursday .
SCHULTZ : Well , we know that we crafted a bill that includes the priorities of the American people to ensure that we can get them working again .
Investing in our nation 's infrastructure , roads and bridges , making sure that we can rebuild schools .
Establishing a streamline health care system so we can computerize medical records and reduce health care costs .
We have to get aid to states to avoid layoffs and teachers and firefighters and police officers .
Those are the kinds of investments that need to be made to ensure that we can get this economy turned around .
Now that 's 90 percent of both bills .
We 've got about a 10 percent difference .
And we 're going to make sure that we negotiate over that last 10 percent and pass a bill that can get the economy turned around and send it to the president .
KING : So you wo n't take the Senate bill .
You will insist in the House on putting some of that spending back in .
SCHULTZ :
The founding fathers created a legislative process that also created the conference committee and we 're going to go through the conference committee and the appropriations process this week , come out with a good product that will help get the economy turned around .
KING : As you know , the new president came to town promising a new era of bipartisanship .
Eight years of George W. Bush , eight years of Bill Clinton , not much true bipartisanship in this town .
Your speaker after the Senate compromise was reached on Friday , made clear she does n't like it .
She said this , " Washington seems consumed in the process argument of the bipartisanship when the rest of the country says they need this bill . "
The process argument of bipartisanship .
The president said it is a critical spirit to have in this town .
Your boss in the House , the speaker , does n't seem to think it 's important .
SCHULTZ : On the contrary , Speaker Pelosi has made bipartisanship and reaching out in the Republicans in the House a priority .
We made sure that we had markup after markup in committee this week and in the last few weeks which included Republican amendments that we heard , that some that we accepted .
We reached out our hand across the aisle , asked them to help craft this legislation .
That was rejected .
So we have made an effort at reaching out our hand across the aisle .
They really seem to be more interested in making sure that this whole process fails .
It 's really baffling to me why they do n't want to pass an economic recovery package .
They 'll have to answer the American people as to why that is .
KING : Well , one of your colleagues on the Republican side , the one -- one of the ones who disagrees with you , Mike Pence , was out this morning and he says this plan is horrible .
Let 's listen .
PENCE : The Senate piece of any effective stimulus bill that 's ever been passed by Congress in the recent past has been tax relief .
The center of this stimulus bill is massive , unaccountable government spending .
And the American people are tired of it .
KING : You 're shaking your head .
But if you had to add some tax cuts to take up some spending to get it palatable , to get three , just three Republican votes over in the Senate .
I 'm going to ask you the last question on this one .
I know you disagree with Congressman Pence .
But will you accept the current mix if that is the only way to get a bill to the president this week ?
SCHULTZ : Well , that is predictable criticism from my friend Mike Pence .
But the bottom line is that we 've had eight years as the president said of doing it their way through pure tax cuts .
We have to have the right mix of tax cuts that go targeted to the middle class , like President Obama 's tax cut that would go to 95 percent of Americans that we included in the House bill .
We 're going to have a balance , the right balance of tax cuts and spending .
McGoohan wrote and starred in The Prisoner from 1967 Emmy - winning actor Patrick McGoohan , best known for starring in cult 1960s TV show The Prisoner , has died at the age of 80 .
He died in Los Angeles after a short illness , his film producer son - in - law Cleve Landsberg told Associated Press .
McGoohan played the character Six in the surreal 1960s show , filmed in the north Wales village of Portmeirion .
He won two Emmy awards for his work on TV detective series Columbo , playing different characters .
The first came for an episode of the series in 1974 , with another 16 years later .
' I am a free man '
The screen star also won a Bafta award for best television actor in 1959 for his role in The Greatest Man In The World , a one - off drama in ITV's Armchair Theatre series .
In more recent years , McGoohan played King Edward Longshanks in the 1995 Mel Gibson film Braveheart .
The actor also starred in ITV series Danger Man , which began in 1960
The actor , who was born in New York and raised in England and Ireland , came to screen prominence in TV series Danger Man , in which he played a secret service agent .
The programme later aired as Secret Agent in the US .
He was later considered for the role of James Bond for the movie Dr No.
But McGoohan was chiefly associated with cult ITV drama The Prisoner , writing some of the episodes himself under a different name .
His character spent the entire time attempting to escape from The Village and finding out the identity of his captor , the elusive Number One .
He repeatedly declared : " I am not a number - I am a free man ! "
In 2000 , McGoohan reprised his most famous role in an episode of The Simpsons .
' Cult status ' Residents of Portemeirion , which has its own The Prisoner shop selling memorabilia from the show , have paid tribute to the star .
Councillor Dewi Lewis said : " It helped to put Portmeirion the village on the map during the 60s and we are still benefiting from that today . "
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" Mr McGoohan is held in high esteem in the area for the work he did - it still has a loyal following of people who come to Portmeirion annually . "
Robin Llywelyn , managing director of the Portmeirion village resort , added : " What he created out of The Prisoner is a lasting piece of TV at its best - it achieved cult status .
It 's something that we are very proud of . "
Last year , ITV confirmed that Passion of the Christ star Jim Caviezel would take the role of Number Six in a remake of The Prisoner , which will also star Sir Ian McKellen .
" His [ McGoohan 's ] creation of The Prisoner made an indelible mark on the sci- fi , fantasy and political thriller genres , creating one of the most iconic characters of all time , " AMC , which is co-producing the remake , said in a statement .
" AMC hopes to honour his legacy in our re-imagining of The Prisoner . "
McGoohan 's last role came in 2002 , as a voice artist in animated picture Treasure Planet .

A Russian Proton rocket blasts of from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan carrying the Russian Express AM44 and MD1 communications satellites .
A Proton rocket blasted offfrom a snow - covered launch pad early Wednesday with a pair of Russian civilcommunications satellites , beginning a lengthy 9 - hour mission to put thespacecraft on track to their new home 22,300 miles above Earth .
The Proton booster ignitedits six first stage engines and roared skyward at 0003 GMT ( though it was 7:03 p.m. Tuesday night EST ) from Complex 200 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan .
Liftoffoccurred in the predawn hours at the launch site .
The rocket ?s three corestages powered the launcher into space within the first 10 minutes of themission , leaving the Breeze M upper stage to complete a series of burns toplace the Express AM44 and Express MD1 satellites into the targeted orbit .
The Breeze M upper stage isscheduled to release Express AM44 at about 0915 GMT .
Deployment of Express MD1 should occur about 15 minutes later , according to the Russian space agency .
Express AM44 was built byReshetnev Co. , a Russian aerospace company formerly known as NPO PM .
Khrunichev , the Russian firm that also builds Proton rockets , manufacturedExpress MD1 .
Thales Alenia Spaceprovided the communications payloads for both satellites , which will beoperated by the Russian Satellite Communications Co. for government andcommercial users .
Express AM44 , weighing 5,582 pounds at launch , will use its own propulsion system to park itself ingeostationary orbit along the equator at 11 degrees west longitude .
The craft will eventuallyreplace the aging Express A3 satellite at that orbital location , which servescustomers across Russia , former Soviet states , Europe , Asia and Africa .
The satellite carries acommunications payload of 16 Ku-band , 10 C - band and a single L - bandtransponder .
The gear is designed to provide digital television and radiobroadcasting , data networking , videoconferencing and Internet services for atleast 12 years .
Express MD1 is the firstmember of a new series of smaller communications satellites to be launched forRSCC .
The 2,513 - pound satellite will be positioned in geostationary orbit at 80 degrees east longitude .
The satellite ?s eightC - band and one L - band transponder will provide secure communications for seniorgovernment leaders in western Russia .
RSCC also plans to launchthe identical Express MD2 satellite , but the company has not released a launchdate for that mission .
The company is alsodeveloping Express AM4 , a massive high - powered satellite built by EADS Astrium .
That launch is scheduled for late 2010 .
The next Proton missioncould occur later this month with a Russian military communications satellite .

For the impatient , read Stephens reply
He benchmarked what I asked and concluded that $ ( " p " , $ ( " # foo " ) ) is much faster in jQuery 1.3.2 .
I 've been coding this style in jQuery for all recent projects so I 'm happy with this outcome .
UPDATE
John Resig himself joined in on the discussion and had this to say :
" You should always use $ ( " #foo " ) . find ( " p " ) in favor of $ ( " p " , $ ( " #foo " ) ) - the second one ends up executing $ (...) 3 times total - only to arrive at the same result as doing $ ( " #foo " ) . find ( " p " ) . "
UPDATE 2
Not only did John join in on the discussion but it also made him work on j Query 1.3.3 ( not yet released at the time of writing ) so that it does n't matter which format you use you get the same performance .

Zebrafish share the p53 gene with humans Scientists say they have discovered a missing link in the way cells protect themselves against cancer .
They have uncovered how cells switch a gene called p53 , which can block the development of tumours , on and off .
The researchers say the finding has important implications for cancer treatment and diagnosis .
The study , published in Genes And Development , was carried out by teams of scientists in Singapore and the University of Dundee .
Discovering how it is regulated will have incredibly important implications in the development of better drugs and ways to diagnose cancer
Lesley Walker
Cancer Research UK
The p53 gene , first discovered 30 years ago , plays a vital role in keeping the body healthy by ordering damaged cells to commit suicide , or by stopping them dividing while key repair work is carried out .
In half of all cancers the gene is either damaged or inactive , giving damaged cells a free rein to keep dividing and form cancer .
In the latest study , the scientists used a genetic trick to make zebrafish turn green when the p53 gene was switched on to explore the way it was regulated .
They found that the p53 gene makes not only the well - established p53 protein , but also an alternative " control switch " variation of the p53 protein - known as an isoform .
Radiation doses Normally zebrafish , which carry the same p53 gene as humans , can survive low doses of radiation , which causes damage to the DNA , because the gene steps in to repair that damage .
But no such repair took place in zebrafish without the isoform switch , and they died after radiation exposure .
The researchers said this proved that the switch played a crucial role in enabling p53 to do its repair work .
Lead researcher Professor Sir David Lane , said : " The function of p53 is critical to the way that many cancer treatments kill cells since radiotherapy and chemotherapy act in part by triggering cell suicide in response to DNA damage .
" So understanding more about how this gene is controlled in cells is really important in finding ways to prevent cells from turning cancerous . "
Lesley Walker , Cancer Research UK 's director of cancer information , said : " This is a really exciting study which improves our understanding of how the p53 gene works .
" Discovering how it is regulated will have incredibly important implications in the development of better drugs and ways to diagnose cancer . "

( CNN ) --
Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden has apparently released a new audio message calling for a jihad , or holy war , against Israel for its Gaza campaign .
Osama bin Laden , in an undated photo , apparently taped a message calling for jihad against Israel .
The 22 - minute message contains " an invitation " from bin Laden to take part in " jihad to stop the aggression against Gaza . "
The audio message was posted on a radical Islamist Web site that has posted other statements from bin Laden in the past .
CNN could not independently confirm the authenticity of the message , but the speaker 's voice was similar to other recordings that bin Laden has made .
While not naming President - elect Barack Obama , bin Laden refers to the future of the United States in the face of the current global economic crisis .
Watch as experts discuss Osama message »
" [ America is ] now drowning in a global financial crisis , " he said .
" They 're even begging all nations , small and large , for help .
America is no longer feared by its enemies nor respected by its allies .
" The decline of the American power is one of the main reasons for Israel 's rushed and barbaric aggression on Gaza in a desperate attempt to take advantage of the last days of [ President ]
Bush 's term in office . "
He appears , however , to refer to Obama , saying " Bush leaves his successor with the worst inheritance ... two long guerrilla wars and no options .
He either withdraws and faces military defeat , or carries on and drowns his nation in financial trouble . "
Watch Obama comment on bin Laden 's message »
The message also names Vice President - elect Joe Biden .
" Here is Biden , the vice president of the president - elect ... [ he ] says that the crisis is bigger than they expected and that the American economy , all of it , is open to collapse , " bin Laden said .
On December 20 , Biden said in an interview that the economy " is in much worse shape than we thought it was in . "
White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said the message " demonstrates [ bin Laden 's ] isolation and continued attempts to remain relevant at a time when al Qaeda 's ideology , mission and agenda are being questioned and challenged throughout the world . "
He noted that the message also appears to be " an effort to raise money as part of [ al Qaeda 's ] ongoing propaganda campaign . "
" The United States promotes an alternative , hopeful ideology while continuing to partner with over 90 countries to pursue terrorists wherever they are , " Johndroe said .
The last time bin Laden released an audio message was in mid-May , timed to coincide with Israel 's 60th anniversary .
That message urged his followers to liberate Palestine .
Israel launched a military offensive in Gaza on December 27 to stop Hamas rocket strikes on southern Israel .
The death toll in Gaza was nearing 1,000 on Wednesday , including more than 300 children , according to Palestinian medical sources .
The Israeli toll stood at 13 , including three civilians , according to Israeli police and military officials .
Bin Laden , who is about 51 , is the head of the al Qaeda terrorist network , which was responsible for the September 11 , 2001 , attack on the United States that killed 2,751 people .
He 's been in hiding since the U.S. assault on Afghanistan that followed the 9/11 attacks .
The U.S. government is offering a $ 25 million reward for information leading to his capture .
President Bush , whose term ends next week , told CNN's Larry King on Tuesday that he remains optimistic that bin Laden would be found .
Asked by King , " Are we ever going to find bin Laden ? "
Bush replied : " Yes , of course , absolutely .
We 've got a lot of people out there looking for him , a lot of assets .
You ca n't run forever . "
The message is important to the incoming U.S. president because it signifies that bin Laden is still " out there , " said Tim Roemer , a former Democratic congressman from Indiana who served on both the congressional and the presidential September 11 commissions .
" It 's a reminder of President - elect Obama 's inheritance of some of the difficult problems out there that he has to confront , " said Roemer , who is president of the Center for National Policy .
" Al Qaeda is trying to be relevant with this tape , " Roemer said .
" They seek competition with Hamas , Hezbollah , the ongoing battle between Israel and the Palestinians .
...
" This reminds us of what bin Laden said right after 9/11 .
He said it was n't 19 Arab armies or 19 Arab states that attacked the United States .
It was 19 post - graduate students .
It reminds us how much the world has changed , and how many different threats are out there today . "

A composite of a man wanted for questioning in a suspicious scrub fire that started yesterday in the Melbourne suburb of Ivanhoe inset over a scene at Churchill , where an arrest has been made by arson investigators .
He has been charged with one count of arson causing death , one count of intentionally lighting a bushfire and one count of possessing child pornography
He was arrested at 4 pm yesterday .
He has been remanded to appear in Melbourne Magistrates Court on Monday .
His lawyer said the man was in a fragile mental state and he did not appear in court .
The maximum penalty for arson causing death is 25 years .
At least ten people died as a result of the Churchill blaze and police expect the toll to rise .
Arsonists usually looked for attention and also had other behavioural issues , Ms Nixon said .
Police were called to a fire in a paddock in the town of Baxter on the Mornington Peninsula , south of Melbourne , about 10.45 pm last night .
It followed an earlier three - hectare scrub fire that began in the Yarra Flats at East Ivanhoe , closer to the city , about 3 pm yesterday .
Police have released an image of a man wanted for questioning over the Ivanhoe blaze that threatened houses , disrupted traffic and sent a plume of smoke across several suburbs .
" Last night , we did , in fact , have two fires that were lit , " Ms Nixon said She said police were also working around the clock in the pursuit of arsonists behind the Marysville blaze .
Fifteen lives were lost at Marysville , amid fears that that death toll could top 100 - a fifth of the town 's population .
" For us , it 's a matter to continue to get information from the community to work through it and to find these people as soon as we can , " Ms Nixon told the Nine Network .
" We 're very keen to do that as , obviously , the whole community wants us to . "
She also has confirmed police were following up reports of looting , adding it was disappointing to see such acts occurring at a time of such devastation .
" When homes are vulnerable it 's really sad to see that kind of thing happening , " Ms Nixon said .
" We 're not seeing a lot of it , but we 're seeing some of it . "
She called on people to report looting to the police so they could get on top of the problem quickly .

" We 're seeing some looting , but we have a lot of police officers out there , a lot of volunteers and others who are paying attention to the issue , " she said .

Scientists study genomes of the sea ( Image : Science )
Humans have around 30,000 genes that determine everything from our eye colour to our sex but Pelagibacter has just 1,354 , US biologists report in the journal Science .
What is more , Pelagibacter has none of the genetic clutter that most genomes have accumulated over time .
There are no duplicate gene copies , no viral genes , and no junk DNA .
' Chicken soup '
The spareness of its genome is related to its frugal lifestyle .
The shorter the length of DNA that needs to be copied each generation , the less work there is to do .
Pelagibacter has even gone one step further .
It has chosen where possible to use genetic letters - or base pairs - which use less nitrogen in their construction : nitrogen is a difficult nutrient for living things to obtain .
The result is one of the most successful organisms on the planet .
Pelagibacter feeds off dead organic matter that is dissolved in ocean water - lead researcher Stephen Giovannoni of Oregon State University likens it to a very thin chicken soup .
The dissolved carbon is always there , so there is no need to build in special metabolic circuits to adjust between periods of feast and famine .
Indeed , in laboratory studies , the Oregon biologists have found that adding nutrients to the broth has no effect on the microbe 's vigour .
Self - sufficient
The sheer abundance of Pelagibacter - there are an estimated 20 billion billion billion Pelagibacter microbes scattered throughout the world 's oceans - is probably what has allowed the organism to streamline its genes .
With so many copies in the ocean , there are plenty of opportunities for random mutations to try out more thrifty combinations .
There are organisms with smaller genomes - Mycoplasma genitalium has about 400 genes .
But these are all obligate parasites or symbionts , relying on other organisms to do the jobs they have abandoned .
Pelagibacter is entirely self - sufficient .
There is a great deal of interest in finding out how few genes a living organism can get away with .
Bio-entrepreneur Craig Venter is trying to create an artificial version of a bacterium , aiming for as few as 300 genes .
Stephen Giovannoni says the synthetic one will barely function .
But Pelagibacter on the other hand , accounting for a quarter of all organisms in the ocean , is a shining example of Darwin 's principle , the survival of the fittest .
When a man meets a friendly woman , chances are he thinks she ’s into him even when she is n’t .
( As discussed in BLONDES this evolutionary bias is reversed in women ; in fact , we ’re more likely to think a man is just not all that into us .
It ’s especially true now that a certain mantra - like book and movie has drummed the notion into women ’s subconscious . )
But can men tell if a woman is into every man she meets , not just him specifically ?
The answer is yes , according to Tyler Stillman and Jon Maner at the University of Florida .
In their latest study , the psychologists asked 24 women to take a questionnaire that measured their sexual strategies , from high restricted ( highly selective ) to unrestricted ( highly promiscuous ) .
Then , one by one , they paired the women up with a “ fairly attractive ” and charismatic male research assistant and asked the duo to solve a Rubik ’s Cube puzzle without talking and using only one hand each .
Later , male and female judges watched videos of the Rubik ’s Cube - solvers , paying special attention to the women ’s body language as they interacted with the cute guy .
When asked to identify which women had promiscuous dispositions , the judges were surprisingly accurate .
This might not be so surprising .
More interesting are the body language cues associated with high sociosexuality versus those that were not .
While you might think any friendly body language might be interpreted by an unknowing observer as licentious , that ’s just not so .
It turns out that classic cues such as smiling , laughing , tilting the head , wearing a provocative dress , touching the hair , leaning towards a man with an open posture , are not reliable signals of promiscuity — just friendly flirtation — and even impartial observers could tell the difference .
What distinguished wanton women ’s behavior from that of their more selective peers were just a handful of cues : eyebrow flashes ( frequent raising of the eyebrows for one - sixth of a second ) , fervid glances , and easy distraction from the task at hand .
In keeping with evolutionary theory , women were even more accurate than men when it came to perceiving whether a woman was an indiscriminate tart .
To men , knowing a woman ’s sexual disposition is helpful .
It ’s an opportunity !
To women , particularly to jealous types , a licentious flirt represents something even more visceral : a threat .
Remember that story a while back , about the guy who apparently had accidently recorded a video of an alien peeping the window of his house ?
Well , it 's happened again .
Sort of .
Surprise ... It 's not an alien .
And , it 's not Swine Flu !

Before the House Financial Services Committee , Humphrey Hawkins Hearing , February 25 , 2008
Mr. Chairman ,
We find ourselves mired in the deepest economic crisis to afflict this country since the Great Depression .
Yet , despite the failure of all the interventionist efforts to date to do anything to improve the economy , each week seems to bring new proposals for yet more bailouts , more funding facilities , and more of the same discredited Keynesian ideas .
There are still relatively few policymakers who understand the roots of the current crisis in the Federal Reserve ’s monetary policy .
No one in government is willing to take the blame ; instead we transfer it onto others .
We blame the crisis on greedy bankers and mortgage lenders , on the Chinese for being too thrifty and providing us with capital , or on consumers who are n’t spending as much as the government thinks they should .
One aspect that needs to come to the fore once again is that of moral hazard .
When the government acts as a backstop to insure losses that come about from making poor decisions , such poor decision - making is rewarded , and thereby further encouraged in the future .
Such backstopping took place through the implicit government guarantee of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , it takes place through FDIC deposit insurance that encourages deposits in the fundamentally unsound fractional - reserve banking system , and it has reached its zenith in the TARP program and its related bailouts .
When banking giants are reimbursed for their losses through redistribution of taxpayer money , what lesson do we expect them to learn ?
Can anyone in Washington say with a straight face that these banks will shape up their business practices when they are almost guaranteed billions of dollars in taxpayer funds ?
Even if this does provide a temporary lifeline , it only delays the inevitable collapse of a banking system built on an unsustainable model .
Fractional - reserve banking is completely dependent on faith in the banks ’ abilities to repay depositors , and when that ability is thrown into doubt , the house of cards comes crashing down .
The Federal Reserve may be able to manage public confidence , but confidence only goes so far .
When banks are required to hold a maximum of ten percent of their deposits on reserve , the system is fundamentally insolvent .
Such a system cannot be propped up or bailed out , except at the cost of massive creation of money and credit , which would result in a hyperinflation that would completely destroy our economy .
Chairman Bernanke and others in positions of authority seem to gloss over these systemic instabilities and assume an excessively rosy outlook on the economy .
I believe we are at another major economic crossroad , where the global financial system will have to be fundamentally rethought .
The post — Bretton Woods dollar - standard system has proven remarkably resilient , lasting longer than the gold - exchange system which preceded it , but the current economic crisis has illustrated the unsustainability of the current dollar - based system .
To think that the economy will begin to recover by the end of this year is absurd .
The dollar ’s supposed strength exists only because of the weakness of other currencies .
The Fed ’s increase of the monetary base and establishment of " temporary " funding facilities has set the stage for hyperinflation , and it remains to be seen what results .
If banks begin to lend their increased reserves , we will see the first steps towards hyperinflation .
Now that the Fed has increased the monetary base , it finds itself under pressure to withdraw these funds at some point .
The question , however , is when ?
If it withdraws too soon , banks ’ balance sheets collapse , if too late , massive inflation will ensue .
As in previous crises , the Fed ’s inflationary actions leave it compelled to take action that will severely harm the economy through either deflation or hyperinflation .
Had the Fed not begun interfering 18 months ago , we might have already seen a recovery in the economy by now .
Bad debts would have been liquidated , inefficient firms sold off and their resources put to better use elsewhere .
As it is , I believe any temporary uptick in economic indicators nowadays will likely be misinterpreted as economic recovery rather than the result of Federal Reserve credit creation .
Until we learn the lesson that government intervention cannot heal the economy , and can only do harm , we will never stabilize the economy or get on the road to true recovery .

The Best of Ron Paul
The Coleman campaign presented the following notice late Friday afternoon informing the Election Contest Court of their forthcoming motion to prevent the redaction of 933 wrongfully rejected absentee ballots :
PLEASE TAKE NOTICE THAT at a time set by the Court at its earliest convenience Contestants will seek a temporary restraining order pursuant to Minn .
R. Civ. P. 65.02 enjoining the Secretary of State 's Office from redacting the absentee ballot envelopes associated with the 933 ballots opened and counted on January 3 , 2009 .
This Motion will be based on the accompanying memorandum and all the files , records and proceedings herein .
Dated : February 20 , 2009 Source : Notice of Motion and Motion for Temporary Injunction via MNCourts.gov [ PDF ]
The Coleman campaign is simply requesting that each of the 933 wrongfully rejected absentee ballots remain individually identifiable .
Their request is in opposition to the February 3rd stipulation instructing the SOS's Office to assimilate these ballots into the larger subset of all accepted absentee ballots .
The Coleman campaign is seeking to halt the processing of that order .
A review of the original stipulation places the Coleman campaign in a somewhat hypocritical position , but the circumstances have changed .
The Election Contest Court presented seven categories of absentee ballots which they deemed worthy of future consideration ; he ECC also denied King Banaian 's Testimony .
In light of these prior events , this latest notice seems strategically plausible .
Deputy Secretary of State , Jim Gelbmann ( who testified for three days ) stated on Friday that about half of the 933 wrongfully rejected absentee ballots had already been redacted in accordance with the stipulation .
These redactions are unlikely to impede Coleman 's intention .
The Coleman campaign has signified that approximately 100 of the 933 wrongfully rejected absentee ballots were actually accepted in opposition to the newly established categories .
I do n't think the Coleman campaign solely intends to decrease their deficit as a result of this latest maneuver ; they are trying to invalidate the process by which the entire set of once rejected absentee ballots were re-examined and eventually counted .
If they are somehow able to prove that one of the 933 ballots was improperly included , they may very well be able to force the equal protection issue .
They do not need the full set of 933 ballots to prove their assertion , if in fact their 100 vote statement is correct .
I 've prepared a few calculations to illustrate this point :
The output of each function represents the probability of an erroneously counted ballot occurring within the currently un-redacted set with respect to the potential number of erroneously counted ballots .
The base case contains 466 un - redacted ballots , with respect to Mr. Gelbmann 's statement , and 100/933 based upon the Coleman campaign 's statement .
Using the above calculations and the just mentioned inputs , there is a 100 % chance that an erroneously counted absentee ballot will be contained within the remaining set of un-redacted ballots .
I also did some other calculations to illustrate other possibilities for comparison .
A graph is also provided below which details all of the possible combinations of error rates and un-redacted ballots :
The bottom line is this : if Coleman 's request is granted and their error estimate is correct or even just partially correct , the already redacted ballots will play absolutely no role in their Equal Protection argument .
If the examination occurs and no errors are found , there is a 69.7 % chance that the singular error exists within the other half of already redacted ballots .
If the motion is approved , this is a win-win for Coleman ; he is either able to prove that inconsistencies occurred , or blame the lawful redaction for his troubles .
It is in Coleman 's absolute best interest to ensure that this motion is granted .
A few excerpts of the Coleman 's argument are presented below :
INTRODUCTION Pursuant to Minn. R. Civ. P. 65.02 , Contestants seek a temporary injunction preventing the Secretary of State 's Office from redacting the envelopes associated with the 933 ballots counted on January 3 , 2009 .
The Court should preserve the status quo until it determines the impact of its February 13 , 2009 Order on absentee ballots already counted in the election , including those counted on January 3 , 2009 .
...
ARGUMENT
Contestants seek the requested relief to preserve the status quo until the Court determines the impact of its February 13 , 2009 Order on absentee ballots already counted in the election .
I. The Relationship Between The Parties Favors Issuance Of An Injunction
The parties are involved in an election contest to determine which party received the highest number of legally cast votes and is therefore entitled to receive the certificate of election .
Which votes are in fact legally cast is at the very heart of the matter - and of the Court 's charge .
Contestants believe the Court must apply its February 13 , 2009 Order to absentee ballots previously counted , including those removed from the envelopes at issue here .
II .
Irreparable Harm Will Result If The Motion Is Not Granted The Court 's February 3,2009 Order directs the Secretary of State 's Office to redact the identifying numbers from the ballot envelopes so that a particular ballot can no longer be tied to the envelope it came in .
Without that identifying information , the Court will be unable to determine which ballot was in fact an illegally cast vote and should not be included in the count of legally cast votes , thus removing an important remedy that would be available if the Court applies its February 13 , 2009 Order to absentee ballots that have already been counted .
III .
Contestants Are Likely To Prevail On the Merits ... IV .
Public Interest Demands That Consistent Standards Be Consistently Applied ... v. Administrative Burden On The Court Is Minimal ... CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above , Contestants respectfully request that this Court issue a temporary injunction directing the Secretary of State 's Office not to redact any information from the envelopes associated with the 933 ballots opened and counted on January 3,2009 pending further order of this Court .

Franken also responded to Coleman 's requested injunction by refuting each of Coleman 's arguments :
Contestee Al Franken opposes Contestants ' Motion for Temporary Injunction ,
The motion flies in the face of a Stipulation and Order freely entered into by the parties and affirmed by the Court .
The Stipulation and Order settled and resolved one of Contestants ' claims and furthered the strong public policy of ballot secrecy .
Contestants ' effort to renege on the stipulation they freely entered and eviscerate the binding order of this Court warrants the imposition of sanctions .
... LEGAL ARGUMENT Contestants ' motion should be denied .
The factors of Dahlberg Bros. v. Ford Motor Co. , 137 N.W.2d 314 ( Minn. 1965 ) all require this result : 1 . The relationship between the parties strongly cuts against an injunction .
The relationship between the parties is governed by the Stipulation and Order of February 3 , 2009 .
Contestants seek to breach the Stipulation , defy the Court Order entered on the stipulation , and make the Court a party to the breach .
2 . Irreparable harm will result if the motion is granted .
As the Supreme Court recognized in its Order of December 24 , 2008 , entered at the request of both Contestants and Contestee herein , ballot secrecy is a paramount public policy .
Minnesota law mandates secret ballots .
See Minn. Stat . § 206.80 ( " An electronic voting system may not be employed unless it : ( 1 ) permits every voter to vote in secret .... " ) ; see also Application of Andersen , 119 N.W.2d 1,8 ( 1962 ) ( " Procedural statutes governing elections are intended to safeguard the right of the people to express their preference in a free election by secret ballot and to have the results of the election governed by the votes so cast . " ) ; Minn. Stat . § 202A.18 ( requiring secret ballots even for caucuses and conventions ) .
The 933 ballots should never have been numbered .
On February 3 , 2009 , recognizing this public policy , Contestants and Contestee freely entered into a Stipulation that the numbers would be removed .
3 . Contestants will not prevail on the merits .
... 4 . The public interest requires that the February 3 Order be enforced .
... 5 . The burden on the Court by this motion is not administrative , but goes directly to the heart of the integrity of the judicial process .
... CONCLUSION
The motion should be denied .
Contestee advised counsel for the Contestant that this motion is baseless and warrants the imposition of sanctions .
Contestee requests that the Court establish a briefing and hearing schedule so that Contestee may bring on a motion under Minn .

After all of this , I find it unlikely that the Election Contest Court will override Coleman 's once prejudiced dismissal of this very topic .
Franken was also supposed to present his updated list of wrongfully rejected absentee ballots on Saturday ; he did apparently do this , but a court filing is unavailable .
The PioneerPress was apparently given access to the document containing 1,585 ballots , 781 of which the Coleman campaign has already identified , but they thought it was more important to talk about " snark " within the document than to actually present the document ; nice work Pioneer Press .
( It 's only a matter of time before they join the likes of their now bankrupt competitor , the StarTribune . )
Of the 1,585 presented by Franken 804 were not already identified by Coleman ; this number is actually slightly more than the 792 he had already presented .
This could mean several things , but it is impossible to definitively conclude anything without actually looking at the list which , should at the vary latest be available on Monday when the ECC resumes .
Portsmouth researchers are part of a bold rescue plan to recover and safeguard the rapidly vanishing technology and cultural information about the generation born and brought up in the digital age .
They are helping build the world 's first general purpose emulator , a piece of software which can recognise and ‘ play ’ or open all previous types of computer files from 1970s Space Invaders games to three - inch floppy discs .
Other emulators exist which are specific to certain platforms or types of media but the new version will be able to emulate media in any format .
Computer historians Dr David Anderson and Dr Janet Delve and computer games expert Dan Pinchbeck at the University of Portsmouth are partners in a € 4.02 m Europe - wide attempt to ‘ rescue ’ digital files from a black hole .
The European project , KEEP ( Keeping Emulation Environments Portable ) , aims to develop methods of safeguarding digital objects including text , sound and image files , multimedia documents , websites , databases and video games .
Dr Delve said : “ People do n’t think twice about saving files digitally – from snapshots taken on a camera phone to national or regional archives .
But every digital file risks being either lost by degrading or by the technology used to ‘ read ’ it disappearing altogether .
Former generations have left a rich supply of books , letters and documents which tell us who they were , how they lived and what they discovered .
There ’s a very real risk that we could bequeath a blank spot in history . ”
Nearly € 1 m has been given to the faculty of Creative and Cultural Industries researchers to help create software that can look back in time and capture the workings of old computers , files , software and technologies .

They also hope to be able to future - proof the software so every single piece of data and software created can be encoded to be read by newer , faster , better computers in the future .
Every year a vast amount of new digital information is created – it has been estimated that in 2010 this will be equivalent to 18 million times the information contained in all the books ever written – and the rate of growth shows no sign of slowing .
Britain ’s National Archive holds the equivalent of 580,000 encyclopaedias of information in file formats that are no longer commercially available ; research by the British Library suggests Europe loses £ 2.7 bn each year in business value because of difficulties in preserving and accessing old digital files .
Dr Anderson said : “ We are facing a massive threat of the loss of digital information .
It ’s a very real and worrying problem .
Things that were created in the 1970s , 80s and 90s are vanishing fast and every year new technologies mean we face greater risk of losing material .
“ Early hardware like games consoles and computers are already found in museums but if you ca n’t show visitors what they did , by playing the software on them , it would be much the same as putting musical instruments on display but throwing away all the music .
For future generations it would be a cultural catastrophe . ”
Researchers – and those in charge of national archives globally – have long been concerned about the threat of losing digital information .

Mr Pinchbeck said : “ A vast bank of information needs to be catalogued and stored .
Games particularly tend not to be archived because they are seen as disposable , pulp cultural artefacts , but they represent a really important part of our recent cultural history .
Games are one of the biggest media formats on the planet and we must preserve them for future generations . ”
Huge amounts of money have been spent trying to convert thousands of pieces of information into newer digital formats every time the old ones are made defunct or the fabric itself corrupts and degrades .
The normal method of doing this is to ' migrate ' obsolete media to new formats , but every migration carries the risk of corruption and degradation .
Emulation recreates the platform used to run the media , so migration is not required and these risks are reduced .
Mr Pinchbeck said “ The difference with emulation is that you are freed from these problems .
Every time hardware , software , operating systems or anything else upgrade , the KEEP machine just emulates on this new platform .
It means it is as future - proof as these things get .
“ On top of that , you can actually boot up and experience these historical artefacts – not just read about them , but in the case of games , actually play , get a feel for what they are really like and how they work .
“ Currently , there are lots of emulators out there , but they are all self - enclosed and can become obsolete just like the media they are emulating .
KEEP changes all of that , it ensures that these emulators and their media will survive . ”
Dr Simon Claridge , the Dean of CCI , said “ This is a very important project that has far - reaching implications and we are delighted that researchers from the University of Portsmouth will be playing such a pivotal role .
It is a clear indication of the international standard of research being undertaken at this institution . ”
Other institutions involved in the KEEP project include the national libraries of France , the Netherlands and Germany and the European Game Developers Federation .
The incursion into Gaza is not about destroying Hamas .
It is not about stopping rocket fire into Israel .
It is not about achieving peace .
The Israeli decision to rain death and destruction on Gaza , to use the lethal weapons of the modern battlefield on a largely defenseless civilian population , is the final phase of the decades - long campaign to ethnically cleanse Palestinians .
The assault on Gaza is about creating squalid , lawless and impoverished ghettos where life for Palestinians will be barely sustainable .
It is about building ringed Palestinian enclaves where Israel will always have the ability to shut off movement , food , medicine and goods to perpetuate misery .
The Israeli attack on Gaza is about building a hell on earth .
This attack is the final Israeli push to extinguish a Palestinian state and crush or expel the Palestinian people .
The images of dead Palestinian children , lined up as if asleep on the floor of the main hospital in Gaza , are a metaphor for the future .
Israel will , from now on , speak to the Palestinians in the language of death .
And the language of death is all the Palestinians will be able to speak back .
The slaughter — let ’s stop pretending this is a war — is empowering an array of radical Islamists inside and outside of Gaza .
It is ominously demolishing the shaky foundations of the corrupt secular Arab regimes on Israel ’s borders , from Egypt to Jordan to Syria to Lebanon .
It is about creating a new Middle East , one ruled by enraged Islamic radicals .
Hamas cannot lose this conflict .
Militant movements feed off martyrs , and Israel is delivering the maimed and the dead by the truckload .
Hamas fighters , armed with little more than light weapons , a few rockets and small mortars , are battling one of the most sophisticated military machines on the planet .
And the determined resistance by these doomed fighters exposes , throughout the Arab world , the gutlessness of dictators like Egypt ’s Hosni Mubarak , who refuses to open Egypt ’s common border with Gaza despite the slaughter .
Israel , when it bombed Lebanon two years ago , sought to destroy Hezbollah .
By the time it withdrew it had swelled Hezbollah ’s power base and handed it heroic status throughout the Arab world .
Israel is now doing the same for Hamas .
The refusal by political leaders from Barack Obama to nearly every member of the U.S. Congress to speak out in the major media in defense of the rule of law and fundamental human rights exposes our cowardice and hypocrisy .
Those who openly condemn the Israeli crimes , including Israelis such as Yuri Avnery , Tom Segev , Ilan Pappe , Gideon Levy and Amira Hass , as well as American stalwarts Noam Chomsky , Dennis Kucinich , Norman Finkelstein and Richard Falk , are ignored or treated like lepers .
They are denied a platform in the press .
They are rendered nearly voiceless .
Falk , the U.N. special rapporteur for human rights in the occupied territories and a former professor of international law at Princeton , was refused entry into Israel in December , detained for 20 hours and deported .
Never mind that nearly all these voices are Jewish .
I called Avnery at his home in Israel .
He is Israel ’s conscience .
Avnery was born in Germany .
He moved to Palestine as a young boy with his parents .
He left school at the age of 14 and a year later joined the underground paramilitary group known as the Irgun .
Four years afterward , disgusted with its use of violence , he walked away from the clandestine organization , which carried out armed attacks on British occupation authorities and Arabs .
“ You ca n’t talk to me about terrorism , I was a terrorist , ” he says when confronted with his persistent calls for peace with the Palestinians .
Avnery was a fighter in the Samson ’s Foxes commando unit during the 1948 war .
He wrote the elite unit ’s anthem .
He became , after the war , a force for left - wing politics in Israel and one of the country ’s most prominent journalists , running the alternative HaOlam HaZeh magazine .
He served in the Israeli Knesset .
During the 1982 siege of Beirut he met , in open defiance of Israeli law , with PLO leader Yasser Arafat .
He has joined Arab protesters in Israel the past few days and denounces what he calls Israel ’s “ instinct of using force ” with the Palestinians and the “ moral insanity ” of the attack on Gaza .
Avnery , now 85 , was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt in 1975 by an Israeli opponent , and in 2006 the right - wing activist Baruch Marzel called on the Israeli military to carry out a targeted assassination of Avnery .
“ The state of Israel , like any other state , ” Avnery said , “ cannot tolerate having its citizens shelled , bombed or rocketed , but there has been no thought as to how to solve the problem through political means or to analyze where this phenomenon has come from , what has caused it .
Israelis , as a whole , cannot put themselves in the shoes of others .
We are too self - centered .
We cannot stand in the shoes of Palestinians or Arabs to ask how we would react in the same situation .
Sometimes , very rarely , it happens .
Years ago when Ehud Barak was asked how he would behave if were a Palestinian , he said , ‘ I would join a terrorist organization . ’
If you do not understand Hamas , if you do not understand why Hamas does what it does , if you do n’t understand Palestinians , you take recourse in brute force .
” The public debate about the Gaza attack engages in the absurd pretense that it is Israel , not the Palestinians , whose security and dignity are being threatened .
This blind defense of Israeli brutality toward the Palestinians betrays the memory of those killed in other genocides , from the Holocaust to Cambodia to Rwanda to Bosnia .
The lesson of the Holocaust is not that Jews are special .
It is not that Jews are unique .
It is not that Jews are eternal victims .
The lesson of the Holocaust is that when you have the capacity to halt genocide , and you do not — no matter who carries out that genocide or who it is directed against — you are culpable .
And we are very culpable .
The F - 16 jet fighters , the Apache attack helicopters , the 250 - pound “ smart ” GBU - 39 bombs are all part of the annual $ 2.4 billion in military aid the U.S. gives to Israel .
Palestinians are being slaughtered with American - made weapons .
They are being slaughtered by an Israeli military we lavishly bankroll .
But perhaps our callous indifference to human suffering is to be expected .
We , after all , kill women and children on an even vaster scale in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The bloody hands of Israel mirror our own .
There will be more dead Palestinian children .
There will be more cases like that of the U.N. school , used as a sanctuary by terrified families , that was blown to bits by Israeli shells , with more than 40 killed , half of them women and children .
There will be more emaciated , orphaned children .
There will be more screaming or comatose wounded in the corridors of Gaza ’s glutted hospital corridors .
And there will be more absurd news reports , like the one on the front page of the Sunday New York Times , titled “ A Gaza War Full of Traps and Trickery . ”
In this story , unnamed Israeli intelligence officials gave us a spin on the war worthy of the White House fabrications made on the eve of the Iraq war .
We learned about the perfidious and dirty tactics of Hamas fighters .
Foreign journalists , barred from Gaza and unable to check the veracity of the Israeli version of the war , have abandoned their trade as reporters to become stenographers .
The cynicism of conveying propaganda as truth , as long as it is well sourced , is the poison of American journalism .
If this is all journalism has become , if moral outrage , the courage to defy the powerful , the commitment to tell the truth and to give a voice to those who without us would have no voice , no longer matters , our journalism schools should focus exclusively on shorthand .
It seems to be the skill most ardently coveted by most senior editors and news producers .
There have always been powerful Israeli leaders , since the inception of the state in 1948 , who have called for the total physical removal of the Palestinians .
The ethnic cleansing of some 800,000 Palestinians by Jewish militias in 1948 was , for them , only the start .
But there were also a few Israeli leaders , including the assassinated Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin , who argued that Israel could not pick itself up and move to another geographical spot on the globe .
Israel , Rabin believed , would have to make peace with the Palestinians and its Arab neighbors to survive .
Rabin ’s vision of two states , however , appears to have died with him .
The embrace of wholesale ethnic cleansing by the Israeli leadership and military now appears to be unquestioned .
“ It seems , ” the Israeli historian Ilan Pappe wrote recently , “ that even the most horrendous crimes , such as the genocide in Gaza , are treated as discrete events , unconnected to anything that happened in the past and not associated with any ideology or system . …
Very much as the apartheid ideology explained the oppressive policies of the South African government , this ideology — in its most consensual and simplistic variety — has allowed all the Israeli governments in the past and the present to dehumanize the Palestinians wherever they are and strive to destroy them .
The means altered from period to period , from location to location , as did the narrative covering up these atrocities .
But there is a clear pattern [ of genocide ] . … ”
Gaza has descended into chaos .
Hamas , which despite Israeli propaganda has never mustered the sustained resistance Hezbollah carried out during the Israeli incursion into southern Lebanon , will be ruled in the future by antagonistic bands of warlords , clans and mafias .
Gaza will resemble Somalia .
And out of that power vacuum will rise a new generation of angry jihadists , many of whom may spurn Hamas for more radical organizations .
Al - Qaida , which has been working to gain a foothold in Gaza , may now have found its opening .
“ Hamas will win the war , no matter what happens , ” Avnery said .
“ They will be considered by hundreds of millions of Arabs heroes who have recovered the dignity and pride of Arab nations .
If at the end of the war they are still standing in Gaza this will be a huge victory for them , to hold out against this huge Israeli army and firepower will be an incredible achievement .
They will gain even more than Hezbollah did during the last war . ”
Israel operates under the illusion that it can crush Hamas and install a quisling Palestinian government in Gaza and the West Bank .
This puppet government will be led , Israel believes , by the discredited Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas , now cowering in the West Bank after being driven out of Gaza .
Abbas , like most of the corrupt Fatah leadership , is a detested figure .
He is dismissed as the Marshal Pétain of the Palestinian people , or perhaps the Hamid Karzai or the Nouri al - Maliki .
He is as loathed as he is powerless .
Israel ’s destruction of Hamas and reoccupation of Gaza will not bring peace or security to Israel .
It will merely obliterate the only internal organization with enough stature and authority in Gaza to maintain order .
The Israeli assault , by destroying Hamas as a governing force , has opened a Pandora ’s box of ills .
Life will become a nightmare for most Palestinians and , in the years ahead , for most Israelis .
OTTAWA - The three opposition leaders signed a historic accord Monday , agreeing to topple the government of Prime Minister Stephen Harper at the first opportunity , likely next Monday , and promising " bold steps " on an economic stimulus package .
Harper has but one chance to stop them .
He can prorogue - or suspend - Parliament this week , essentially shutting it down until he and his party can return to the House of Commons early in the new year with a budget .
Even on that point , though , there are some constitutional experts who may argue a prime minister cannot prorogue Parliament simply to avoid a confidence motion he surely knows he will lose .
Liberal Leader Stephane Dion said Monday the coalition he will lead will be a " stable , effective alternative " to the governing Conservatives .
" Given the critical situation facing our fellow citizens and the refusal and inability of the Harper government to deal with this critical situation , the opposition parties have decided that it was now time to take action , " Dion said at the accord signing , flanked by NDP Leader Jack Layton and Bloc Quebecois Leader Gilles Duceppe .
" I would certainly not want to find myself governing this economy today and in this position , under a situation where I was required to follow socialist economics and be at the behest of the veto of the separatists , " Harper said in the House of Commons , just before the accord was formally signed .
Harper urged the opposition parties to at least wait for his government 's budget , which will be tabled on Jan. 27 .
Finance Minister Jim Flaherty accused the opposition parties of having no confidence in the Canadian economy .
" They would rather make a deal with the devil , " Flaherty said .
" This is a coalition that 's supported by separatists , people who would break up our country , " said Environment Minister Jim Prentice .
" This is a serious situation .
It is irresponsible and it is undemocratic . "
Bloc Quebecois Leader Gilles Duceppe said his party is ready to support the coalition because the Conservatives chose partisan games based on ideological beliefs instead of considering the interests of Quebecers and Canadians .
" Since last Friday , the Conservatives have retreated on some points , but nothing could restore the trust that was broken by Stephen Harper , " Duceppe said .
" In front of the urgency to act on the economic crisis , we started negotiations with the other opposition parties .
Each one showed openness and a willingness to make compromises , which allowed us to reach an agreement . "
Gov. Gen. Michaelle Jean will play a key and historic role in any potential turn of events .
If , for example , Harper loses a confidence vote next week , he can ask Jean to dissolve Parliament so that another general election could be held .
The Conservatives , in preparation for this possibility , have already put down a deposit on a campaign plane and buses .
But some constitutional experts - and even many Conservatives - believe Jean will exercise her constitutional option to invite Dion to form a government .
The actions Jean would take if asked to prorogue Parliament two weeks after a throne speech is less clear .
It is an issue no Canadian governor general has had to face .
Prentice would not say if the government will ask for Parliament to be prorogued , saying only that " the government will consider all steps that are reasonable , to protect the interests of our country , and the interests of Canadians . "
Earlier in the day , National Revenue Minister Jean - Pierre Blackburn said prorogation was an option the government was considering .
" We 're realizing that no matter what we had come out with in the economic statement , their game plan was set .
It 's a kind of coup d'etat , " Blackburn said .
Jean is travelling this week on state visits to some European countries .
She is scheduled to return to Canada on Friday night .
In any event , Dion appears poised to become Canada 's 23rd prime minister , at the head of a coalition Liberal - NDP government , if the government loses a confidence vote next week or , should the Governor General grant Harper 's request to prorogue Parliament , as soon as he recalls Parliament .
Under the terms of the accord signed by the opposition leaders and made public Monday , the size of the cabinet is set at 24 plus the prime minister , with six cabinet spots reserved for NDP MPs .
The accord specifies that the position of finance minister will be filled by a Liberal MP .
Dion will remain prime minister so long as he is leader of the Liberal party .
As he has given his intention to resign effective May 2 , the winner of the Liberal leadership race - the declared contestants are Michael Ignatieff , Bob Rae and Dominic LeBlanc - will become prime minister on assuming the leadership of the Liberal party .
" My commitment is to give , May 2 , to my successor a strong government with a stronger Canada able to face the storm , and it's what I will do .
I am honoured to do that , " said Dion .
It is possible and even likely that Ignatieff and Rae will be asked into cabinet .
Dion said he would choose " the best talents and skills regardless of the leadership race " in the Liberal and NDP caucuses for his cabinet .
The deal between the NDP and Liberals will expire on June 30 , 2011 .
The Bloc Quebecois has agreed to vote with the coalition on any matters of confidence but only for the next 18 months .
The Liberals and New Democrats have a total of 114 seats in the 308 - seat Parliament .
The Conservatives have 143 , just 12 short of a majority .
The coalition leaders could not provide detailed spending estimates on their fiscal stimulus plan and said they could not say when they will introduce it until they learn what the government will do .
But they did agree to accelerate infrastructure spending , construction and retrofit spending on housing , make strategic investments in key sectors such as manufacturing , forestry and auto manufacturing .
The coalition also proposes a new agency to reform Employment Insurance and introduce reforms to reduce minimum withdrawals from RRSPs .
Harper did not speak to reporters Monday but at a Christmas party for Conservative staffers at an Ottawa hotel , Harper told supporters the country 's very unity was at stake .
" We will use all legal means to resist this undemocratic seizure of power , " Harper said .
The reaction from provincial premiers to the crisis was mixed .
Quebec Premier Jean Charest , campaigning for re-election , tried to skate around the whole issue .
" Everything is moving quickly , " Charest said Monday .
" I have no intention of commenting on what is happening in Ottawa . "
Earlier in Montreal Charest said Quebecers and Canadians made their choice in the Oct. 14 federal election and the result is the political instability of a minority government .
" Political instability and economic instability make a bad mix , " Charest told reporters .
" We can't rewrite history in reverse and question the choice the voters made . "
Alberta Premier Ed Stelmach urged the federal leaders to put " selfishness " aside and instead focus on governing the country through the global economic crisis .
" Put Canada first and stop the nonsense , " Stelmach said Monday at the legislature .
" This is a time when we need sane , prudent leadership when dealing with the bigger elephant in the room , which is the global economic crisis , a real concern to all Albertans . "
Stelmach said he hoped cooler heads would prevail in the days to come , but did not rule out working with the coalition government .
Manitoba 's New Democrat Premier Gary Doer said he played no part in Layton 's moves on Parliament Hill and that he'd prefer to see stability in Ottawa .
" I 'd prefer stability in Parliament , " he said .
" I think all four parties should be working together .
I think regrettably that 's not happening in Parliament right now . "
Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall blasted all federalleaders Monday for taking Canada to the brink of a coalition government .
" Somewhere along the line , political interests began to overtake the interests of Canada and I just believe , I 'm hopeful , that it 's not too late to get those things back on track , " Wall said .
" We believe there are steps that can be take very rapidly , bold steps , " said Layton .
" There will be sense of urgency , focus and determination on the need to address the economic crisis , using those tools which can produce the most rapid action possible . "
It is also proposing reforms on bankruptcy laws to protect pensions and a support program for elderly workers who have lost their jobs to help them make the transition to retirement .
Notably , Dion said the corporate tax cut program announced by the Conservatives in Budget 2008 would proceed .
The corporate income tax rate is to drop to 19 per cent from 19.5 per cent next year and will drop to 15 per cent by 2012 , giving Canada one of the lowest corporate income tax rates in the world .
Dion also said the coalition would not revisit the issue of the Canadian commitment to Afghanistan .
Harper had already indicated that Canadian troops will continue their current combat role with NATO forces in Afghanistan until 2011 .
What 's in the deal : - The Liberals and NDP agree to maintain the coalition for at least 30 months .
The Bloc would support the coalition for at least 18 months , but is free to vote against government .
It was one thing for science to destroy geocentrism , or to turn the Bible from literal history into lovely metaphor , but when it tried to dethrone man as God ’s masterpiece and render him no better ( or worse ) than marsupial or mollusk , then science simply had gone too far .

Intelligent design means that various forms of life began abruptly through an intelligent agency , with their distinctive features already intact - fish with fins and scales , birds with feathers , beaks , and wings , etc .
Creation means that various forms of life began abruptly through an intelligent creator , with their distinctive features already intact - fish with fins and scales , birds with feathers , beaks , and wings , etc .
Sunday Science Book Club , February 15 2009 by Edward HumesHarperCollins , 2007
It is rare for the world to see born on one day two towering individuals whose imprint on history is strong enough to be noted around the world 200 years later .
Abraham Lincoln successfully saw the United States through a near - fatal convulsion , whose early symptoms had been palliated but not cured at the nation ’s founding ; the after - effects have reached all around the world .
Charles Darwin , more than anyone else in the 19th century , put biology on its modern scientific footing , and his ideas play a critical role in the genome sciences at the very forefront of 21st century biology .
We celebrate their achievements this week , but both Lincoln and Darwin have left legacies of divisiveness , and in fact these legacies intertwine .
The contours of the rift that initiated the Civil War still shape American politics , from Nixon ’s influential Southern Strategy to the Red State - Blue State divide in the 111th Congress .
Evolution is a poster child for culture war .
It may not be a top issue on the national political agenda , but it is a culture war conflict that penetrates just as deeply and personally than any other , as Edward Humes vividly describes in Monkey Girl , the best book about the nation ’s first court trial over Intelligent Design in public schools .
Darwin divides because his discovery illuminates who we are as human beings .
It ’s hard to overstate how the science of the last 500 years has shifted our relationship to the rest of the Universe , at least as that relationship has been seen in the West .
We ’ve gone from being the entire purpose of creation , placed at the center of the universe to face an epic struggle between good and evil , to one species among millions , residing during a brief moment on a stage much too big for the drama , as the physicist Richard Feynman put it .
As Humes ’ writes , Evolution was the last straw .
Most people do n’t come to the issue with a solid sense of this history , but the problem of perspective raised by evolution is deeply felt .
Different religions and believers have adapted their stance in various ways .
How a religious believer relates theology to science is an extremely personal choice , and Monkey Girl very effectively captures the gritty friction produced when these personal choices bump up against one another .
Some members of the school board in Dover , Pennsylvania , felt strongly that creationism needed to be taught to Dover ’s public school students in order to counter the influence of evolutionary biology in the science curriculum .
When the school district ’s science teachers requested funds to purchase a new biology textbook for the high school , two creationist members of the Board , Alan Bonsell and William Buckingham , saw an opening and took it .
They essentially held the new textbook hostage , refusing to purchase the needed books until the rest of the board agreed to allow room for creationism in the curriculum .
After months of heated school board meetings , vandalism , taunts , severed friendships , resignations of pro-evolution school board members , and even death threats , the school district settled on what was supposed to be a compromise .
Before the start of the evolution unit of the 9th grade biology curriculum , school officials walked into class and read a one - minute statement telling students , in tortured English , that there were gaps in evolutionary theory “ for which there is no evidence , ” and that students could turn to an Intelligent Design textbook , Of Pandas and People , as a reference .
While the statement was read , the science teachers ( who refused to read the statement themselves ) left the room , along with other students who were conscientious objectors to the new policy .
Copies of the intelligent design textbook were donated to the school , after Buckingham and Bonsell failed to get the school board to purchase this book .
The personal pain on both sides of this conflict was real .
One of the plaintiffs in the resulting court case , Julie Smith , who was suing the school board to stop the intelligent design policy , related on the witness stand how the school board ’s actions had prompted her daughter to come home and ask , “ What kind of Christian are you anyway ? ”
Smith 's daughter had concluded that “ you ca n’t be a good Christian and believe in that lie ” of evolution .
Smith herself believed that Christianity and evolution were compatible , and was angry that the school board had injected itself into such a personal issue .
One of the main school board culprits , William Buckingham was bullying , manipulative , and deceitful , even to the point of lying under oath in court , but nobody can doubt his sincerity when during a school board meeting he declared , “ Two thousand years ago somebody died on a cross .
Ca n’t someone take a stand for him ? ”
In Monkey Girl , Humes lets the players speak for themselves , and he makes the reader understand the motivations driving the players in this story .
The fracture in the community of Dover and the resulting hostility between neighbors that this conflict produced makes clear why the Founders of the United States were so determined to keep the government out of the radioactive matter of religion that had bloodied Europe and the Middle East for centuries .
There is nothing like religious division to prompt different segments of a community to see each other in apocalyptic terms , and nothing brings these latent conflicts to the surface like evolution .
If the fight between evolution and creationism was confined to popular books , newspaper editorials , and debates on cable news channels , the community of Dover would never have been embroiled in conflict , nor would the school board have squandered millions of dollars on a court case .
Evolution and creationism are divisive but abstract issues until they show up on the agenda of school board meetings .
And it is at this point that the story stops being one of two equal sides with different personal preferences .
Humes may give all of the participants in the Dover drama their due , but he also makes it clear that the wrongs lie largely on one side of this conflict ; one side is wrong on the science , the law , and even the theology .
Just how wrong the school board promoters of intelligent design were is made clear in the ruling of the presiding judge , John Jones .
Jones condemned the “ breathtaking inanity ” of the school board , and handed down an overwhelming victory for the plaintiffs .
Jones ’ decision emphasizes just how one - sided this issue is , because he was not someone predisposed to rule in favor of evolution out of purely ideological sympathies .
Jones was a protegé of the conservative , Republican former senator Rick Santorum , and he was appointed to the federal bench by George W. Bush .
Some supporters of evolution were initially nervous about the fact that Jones had been assigned the case , but this worry was misplaced because the legal and scientific issues in the evolution / creation conflict so heavily favor one side .
With a few dramatic exceptions , like Alabama ’s Ten Commandments judge , judges are conscientious professionals , whether Republican or Democrat .
In some hot - button issues , like abortion , the opposing legal sides are closely balanced , and the ideological sympathies of a judge can make a difference in the outcome .
When it comes to creationism , court decisions have overwhelmingly opposed its insertion into public school science classes , and there was no reason to believe that Judge Jones , as a professional arbiter of the law , was going to be any more sympathetic to creationism than previous judges who ruled on the issue .
Jones ’ decision was made easier by the missteps of the defendants .
The creationist school board members could not coherently describe evolution or intelligent design , and they subscribed to dubious ideas about the First Amendment ’s Establishment Clause that have never held water with the US Supreme Court .
The intelligent design movement itself is no better .
This movement bills itself as a revolutionary new science , but in reality it is a well - funded public relations campaign .
Instead of going into the lab or the field to do science , intelligent design promoters write popular books and give lectures to church audiences .
Instead of writing scientific papers like most scientists , they put their most technical thinking into a high school textbook , Of Pandas and People ( now put out in revised form as Exploring Evolution ) , in an attempt to side - step the process of persuading the scientific community of the validity of design .
Instead of taking their case to professional scientists , intelligent design advocates take their case to school boards around the country ; this is not how any real science operates .
As it turns out , it did n’t take much to turn creationism into the supposedly scientific intelligent design .
During the trial , the plaintiffs subpoenaed early drafts of Pandas , written before a 1987 Supreme Court decision banning creationism from science class .
These drafts made it clear that Pandas was originally written as a creationist textbook , and then hastily revised in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling .
The smoking gun was found in the very definition of intelligent design found in Pandas .
According to the book , But in an earlier draft , the passage readIntelligent design is creationism in all but its name .
The negative effects of this campaign to indoctrinate public school children in a religious alternative to a mainstream science topic that some Christians find distasteful were not just the conflict in the Dover community .
Dover ’s science teachers resisted the intelligent design policy , but because they feared for their jobs , they could only resist so much .
High school students , who could n’t imagine that teachers would be afraid to teach , interpreted the teachers ' careful navigation of the minefield as a tacit admission that evolution was weak , which was exactly the opposite impression of what the teachers meant to convey .
The students were being deliberately turned off to science .
The school board and the administration were , through their actions , hinting that scientists were deceptive and that science was not compatible with the faith held by many of the students .
By conveying the warped view of science embraced by the promoters of intelligent design , the school was ruining the students ' education in a subject that is important for their success , both in college and as citizens .
As University of Minnesota biologist P.Z. Myers put it , “ Any attempt to incorporate faith and the supernatural into science is as destructive to the enterprise as would be requiring religion to provide concrete repeatable tests of their beliefs .
” Monkey Girl demonstrates that the battle over evolution in school has real consequences , and that this conflict is being driven largely by one side , in ignorance of science , law , and the wide diversity of religious beliefs in the United States .
Humes ’ great service is to bring clarity to the issue while acknowledging the sincerity of all involved .
As he writes , “ There is no greater waste or tragedy than a war based on falsehoods ; if the evolution wars are to continue , let the combatants be armed with facts , not fiction .

The creaking prison system in France unveils a new post - release labour scheme .
Under the terms of the " Les Clés de l’avenir " agreement signed earlier this year prisoners can have their sentences reduced if they pass a selection process and are found work with one of the partnership firms .
The following four areas will be open to prisoners : catering , cleaning , building and logistics .
Prisoners will have to wear electronic tags and they will be monitored for at least six months to ensure that they have ' successfully adapted ' on release .
Although Medef is claiming that their motives come from a sense of civic duty it is n't hard to see how workers who risk prison if they lose their jobs will be almost certain to face a higher degree of exploitation .
The French prison service is creaking at the seams , with an official capacity of 51000 inmates and a current total of 63750 .
For geographical reasons some prisons are operating at double their intended capacity ; Gradignan , Montluçon , Poitiers were all named in a recent report by a coalition of left - wing groups that mounted an investigation into the prison system .
In some cases a cell 14 metres square will contain 4 prisoners ; in others two prisoners will have beds while a third will be on a mattress on the floor .
The plan comes against a backdrop of a contracting economy , with net fall in employment of 0.3 % in the last two months .
Overcrowding means access for prisoners to exercise , healthcare , education , sanitation , visitors and even to work .
Prison officers unions have been strongly protesting against the overcrowding , collective action by officers at Toulon - La Farlède prevented an increase of 118 in prisoner numbers .
These conditions have been blamed for a rise in violence in the prisons and also for an unprecedented wave of suicides that has seen over 100 deaths this year already .
The French probation service which , like all public services , is suffering from the heavy cuts ordered by Sarkozy is unable to cope with the numbers of prisoners currently on probation , with many officers assigned up to 200 cases .
The main reason for overcrowding is simply an increase in the numbers being sent to prison , especially for minor offences , some 15000 of the current prisoner population were sentenced to less than a year and half of those to less than six months .
Shanghai --
China 's weapons laws are among the world 's toughest .
Its blanket ban on private ownership of rifles , pistols and even gun replicas is a core tenet of social policy .
Still , a gun culture is taking hold .
China may be freer from gun crime than many nations , and official statistics show overall crime on a continuous down trend .
Yet , these days , reports about gun crimes turn up as often as several times a week even in the tightly controlled state - run media .
The reports are often brief , without much follow - up as cases ...

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China closed 12 highways around the capital Beijing on Thursday because of heavy snow brought on after seeding clouds with chemicals , state media said on Thursday .
All outbound highways were closed in Hebei , the drought - hit northern province surrounding Beijing , after heavy snow fell on Wednesday night , Xinhua news agency said .
In all , 12 highways , including one linking Beijing and Shenyang , capital of northeastern Liaoning province , were closed .
Hebei got its first heavy snow of this year on Wednesday .
The provincial weather bureau said that snow too was “ enhanced ” by artificial seeding .
“ The snow has brought moisture to the soil , which may help end the drought , ” Guo Yingchun , a senior engineer of the provincial meteorological observatory , was quoted as saying .
She said that 313 cigarette - size sticks of silver iodide were fired into the clouds from Wednesday night to Thursday morning , “ a procedure that made the snow a lot heavier . ”
Hebei forecasters said flurries would continue through Thursday night in the northern part of the province .
Beijing is enduring its longest drought in 38 years , according to weather bureau records .
There is an update to this post !
Plese visit the new post that has a downloadable , generic plugin .
At the end of last year , we launched a website for Coastal & Marine Sciences in North Carolina with one of our Agency Partners , Liaison Design Group .
As a part of the project , the website was supposed to have an interactive map that showed some information and the location of the various Marine Science outposts across the state .
The locations would be represented by dots and upon clicking one an info box would pop up and display information about the location .
To make the map as engaging as possible , there needed to be smooth animations and crisp graphics .
Traditionally such a project would require the use of Flash .
We try to avoid Flash whenever possible , so I began to consider how the project could be accomplished in jQuery .
There were a number of advantages of using jQuery over Flash for the project :
Updates were Easy : Since the map was going to be a visual representation of html , it would be easy to update the data with our Content Management Software .
Each location would be a ' page ' in the system with contents and attributes like pixel coordinates that would be simple to update .
Content was Search Engine Friendly : Since all of the data was represented in html , it would be easy for search engines to index and spider the content .
Architecture would be naturally layered :
All of the data would be stored in a database by the CMS .
I would then build html templates for the information that the CMS would display .
jQuery and CSS would then take the html content and display it appropriately .
Each layer would have a natural role so it would be easy to make changes to any individual component of the application without having to worry about the whole thing .
My biggest concern using jQuery was performance .
An important requirement of the project was that the map should zoom when switching between coastal areas .
In Flash this would not be a problem , since transformations like these would be executed at a very low level on computer hardware .
This is not the case with jQuery , instead the DOM would need to be manipulated and then displayed .
I knew that this could be a struggle for less efficient browers like IE6 .
Fortunately this turned out not to be a problem in the end .
The Five Locations
In total , there were five maps that needed to be displayed and roughly 70 location dots .
The artwork for these maps was beautifully done by Liaison .
The first map would show the entire NC coast and some of the location dots that were not highly concentrated .
It would also show 4 highlighted areas that could be clicked to zoom in to the other 4 maps where there were more highly concentrated location dots .
In order to simplify the code I had to write , I came up with the following rough procedure to run when one of the five maps was shown :
Load the background image Load the bullets and info boxes
Place the bullets and hide the info boxes Attach events to the bullets to display the boxes
Add either the " Return to NC Coast " link or the Zoom - able regions
With this decided , I just need to come up with the markup for each bullet and a couple of jQuery functions to make it all work .
The Bullets and Info Boxes
The bullets and info - boxes for each map would follow a convention that allowed some simple jQuery to link the two together :
As you can see , both the bullet link and the info - box have similar ids that can be used to reference each other .
The class of the bullet contains its color and its rel attribute contains its pixel coordinates .
The jQuery to display this on the map and add the info - box event is dead simple :
$ ( this ) .children ( ' a.bullet ' ) .each ( function ( ) { var coords = $ ( this ) . attr ( ' rel ' ) .split ( '-' ) ; $ ( this ).css ( {left : coords [ 0 ] + ' px ' , top : coords [ 1 ] + ' px'} ) .hide ( ) . fadeIn ( ) .click ( function ( ) {showPopup ( $ ( this ) . attr ( ' id ' ) ) ; } ) ; } ) ;
The showPopup method is simple as well :
function showPopup ( id ) { $ ( ' #map div.popup ' ) .fadeOut( ) ; var boxid = ' # ' + id + '- box ' ; $ ( boxid ) .fadeIn ( ) ; $ ( 'a.close ').click ( function ( ) { $ ( this ) .parent ( ).fadeOut( ) ; } ) ; }
The code simply relies on the convention between the bullet link id and the info - box id to select and display the box .
At the same time it is sure to close any other infobox popup that may be open .
Handling the Zoomable Regions
When the NC Coast map is displayed , in addition to the location bullets , there are also four zoomable regions .
Like the bullets and infoboxes I settled on a naming convention that made the code much simpler .
The id of all of the related elements as well as map images would be derivable from rules .
Since it was important not to load all of the images at once for concern about loading time , I placed and sized a simple blank gif over each of the regions :
$ ('
' ) .css ( { border : ' none ' , position : ' absolute ' , width : width + ' px ' , height : height + ' px ' , top : top + ' px ' , left : left + ' px ' , cursor : ' pointer ' } ) ;
I also attached a click even to this image so that the zooming would occur when the time came :
.appendTo(' #map').click ( function ( ) { $ ( this ) .siblings ( ) .fadeOut ( ) ; $ ( this ) . hide ( ) .attr( ' src ' , id + ' _base.jpg ' ) . fadeIn ( ' slow ' ) .animate ( { width : ' 577 px ' , height : ' 418 px ' , top : ' 0 px ' , left : ' 0 px ' } , 1000 , '' , function ( ) {
$ (' #map').css({backgroundImage : 'url ( id + ' _base.jpg ) '}).empty ( ) ; loadBullets ( id , true ) ; } ) ; } ) ;
You 'll notice that when clicked , the blank image is swapped for the real one and it is resized to match the map and placed in the top left corner .
j Query 's animate function handles these linear transforms with no problem and the map is smoothly scaled into place .
It results in a simple yet nifty effect .
Conclusion
In this case , jQuery was a great alternative to Flash .
Because of the beautiful artwork , the interactive map looks great with the jQuery animations .
The potential performance problem was not an issue and the client is able to have control of the maps content without having to bother a web developer .
It is great to have the opportunity to work on such a fun project in partnership with a talented designer and a client that is as excited about technology as we are .

Imagine yourself watching movie of an unbelievably slow fog .
You do n't see edges and sharp borders .
Now play the movie with 10 fps .
It will look fluid .
Why ?
Because the difference from one frame to the other is very low .
The extreme would be a totally unmoving wall :
Then 1 fps would equal 1000 fps .
Now take your hand and move it slowly in front of your face .
Then move it faster until it 's blurry .
How many frames per second do you see ?
It must be little , because you see only a blurred hand without being able to distinguish every change per millisecond , but it must be many , because you see a fluid motion without any interruption or jump .
So this is the eye 's trick in both examples : Blurring simulates fluidity , sharpness simulates stuttering .
( It 's similar to " rotation simulates gravity " . )
Motion blur example1 : Capture from a live performance of The Corrs " What can I do " at MTV Unpluged
Motion blur example2 : Capture from " Basic Instinct " , where you see a woman plunging an ice pick into a man 's body while sitting on him .
The fact is that the human eye perceives the typical cinema film motion as being fluid at about 18 fps , because of its blurring .
If you could see your moving hand very clear and crisp , then your eye needed to make more snapshots of it to make it look fluid .
If you had a movie with 50 very sharp and crisp images per second , your eye would make out lots of details from time to time and you had the feeling , that the movie is stuttering .
Also 25 fps but without motion blur : Footage from BBC 's story about Ed Gein , the murderer , who 's case inspired Hitchcock to make " Psycho " and Jonathan Demme to make " Silence of the Lambs " .
The music is from CNN's " Marketmakers " ( 0.52 MB ) .
Just think of modern games :
Have you ever played Quake with 18 fps ?
There is no motion blur in those games , thus you need a lot of frames per second more .
However , you see the spots and the dirt of single frames in a cinema film , do n't you ?
And those movies are played at 24 fps .
So there is a difference between seeing motions fluid and seeing that there 's something ( dirt ) at all .
Read on .
There are , by my count , two types of ghosts : vengeful spirits out for death and mayhem , and lost souls simply trying to make something right before moving on to the afterlife .
There is n’t a whole lot you can do with the first type ; they ’re basically just pricks who are best avoided .
The second type , however , often needs our help to resolve something before moving on .
So if they need us , and ostensibly are not out to hurt people , why must they communicate with the living in the most pants - shittingly terrifying way possible ?
It seems to me that it would be a lot easier to , say , help a person find your murderer if said person was n’t climbing the walls in sheer , stupefying fear .
If ghosts want our help , and I truly believe that they do , perhaps it ’s time for them to take a look at themselves and find a better method for seeking assistance from the living , because scaring the bejesus out of us just is n’t cutting it .
After all , not all of us have the steely reserve of a young Craig T. Nelson in Poltergeist .
For example , when I enter a room , I will be quite disinclined toward keeping an open mind and investigating a presumed mystery if I happen to catch , out of the corner of my eye , a half - decayed and mostly see - through woman hovering inches above me in the mirror .
Call me old fashion if you must , but I find the thought of animated , partially - opaque human remains to be quite unsettling .
When you stop to think about it , ghosts have a whole litany of stunts that end up doing more harm than good .
Consider the following :
Bleeding walls
Suddenly rearranged furniture
Cold chills and hot spots
Showing up unexpectedly in photography , mirrors , and in the eyes of children and animals
Disembodied , threatening voices
Causing hallucinations of past events
Leaving thick , slimy residue ( ectoplasm , if you will ) on whatever they touch
Dragging people into horrible ghost worlds
Starting unexplainable fires , often in dark rooms for whatever reason
Interrupting television and radio programs with startling images and sounds , and / or changing the station to an off - putting video or song over and over again
Locking people in rooms
Would you , as an average person , feel comfortable sticking around to assist the deceased after they pulled any of those stunts ?
Even if , somehow , they did n’t scare the hell out of you , they would almost certainly be a massive inconvenience .
Who wants to continually unstack dining room chairs whenever you reenter the room , or clean up unexplained blood from a wall ?
Surely most of us have better things to do with our time .
Not only are most of these spirits ’ pranks inconvenient , the could have a negative impact on your social life .
It would be awfully difficult to have guests over if you were unable to keep you house at a comfortable , consistent temperature , and no one is going to want to visit you when they constantly hear spectral voices demanding that they “ Get out ” every time they drop by .
The whole affair is unnecessary and inconvenient .
And what about possession ?
When did that become acceptable ?
Surely even the most unrefined undead must realize that infesting a human being and taking control of their body is quite an imposition , especially considering the recently deceased tend to pick the most inconvenient times to take control of your body .
Most of us , after embarrassing ourselves in front of friends and family while possessed , are n’t going to stick around and try to help the lost soul who pulled those shenanigans .
We ’ll be a lot more likely to simply move , or , if we ’re feeling brave , hire the finest team of ghost busters we can afford .
If spirits want our help , then they ’re going to need to start working with us a little .
Instead of frightening us , why not just leave us a nice note ?
And use a pen , no one wants to read something that appears to be scrawled hastily in human blood .
Sure , it would still be pretty weird , but at least it ’s a lot better than setting our dark room on fire .
This has been Dave sayin ’ : “ Well , maybe she would n’t be a lesbian if you tucked your shirt in . ”

8 Powerful Features of C.Vim Plugin
Feature 1 : Add Automatic Header to *.c file
When you open a file with the extension .c it opens the file with header as shown below .
This will also place the cursor in the Description field in Insert mode .
$ vim myprogram .c /* * =================================================
* Filename : myprogram.c * * Description : * * Version : 1.0 * Created : 01/19/09 20:23:25 * Revision : none * Compiler : gcc * * Author : Dr. Fritz Mehner ( mn ) , mehner@fh-swf.de * Company : FH SÃ¼dwestfalen , Iserlohn * * ================================================= */
To change the default value of the AUTHOR and COMPANY , modify the default value in ~/.vim/c-support/ templates / Templates
$ vim ~/.vim/c-support/templates/Templates
|AUTHOR| = geekstuff |AUTHORREF| = gk |EMAIL| = subscribe@geekstuff |COMPANY| = thegeekstuff.com
Now , when you create a new c file , it will show the modified values for AUTHOR and COMPANY as shown below .
$ vim myprogram .c /* * =================================================
* * Filename : myprogram.c * * Description : * * Version : 1.0 * Created : 01/19/09 20:26:43 * Revision : none * Compiler : gcc * * Author : geekstuff ( gk ) , subscribe@geekstuff * Company : thegeekstuff.com * * ================================================= */
Note :
To add custom fields to the header , modify the ~/.vim/c-support/templates/file-description.template file and add your own custom field .
Feature 2 : Adding C function using \if
For writing a subroutine , type \if in normal mode , which will prompt for the function name ( as shown in Fig1 below ) and inserts the subroutine with default function content ( as shown in Fig2 below ) .
Fig1 : Insert C Function Automatically

Fig 6 : Insert a Frame Comment Automatically
Feature 6 : To include header file , use \p <
Type \p < in the normal mode , which will include the text “ # include <> ” , and places the cursor in the < symbol in Insert mode where you can type the header file name .
Feature 7 : Save the file , compile it and execute it immediately .
To save and compile the file use \rc .
To run use \rr .
Feature 8 : Insert pre-defined code - snippet to the C code using
r
The plugin comes with few pre-defined code snippets that you can insert into your code .
Following are the default code snippets that comes with the plugin .
$ ls ~/.vim/c-support/codesnippets
Makefile calloc_double_matrix.c main.c print_double_array.c.noindent Makefile.multi-target.template calloc_int_matrix.c main.cc print_int_array.c.noindent
For example , if you want to create a function that will Allocate a dynamic int-matrix of size rows * columns ; return a pointer , you can re-use it from the existing code snippets .
Following is the content of the calloc_int_matrix .c pre-defined code snippets .
/* * === FUNCTION ======================================================================
* Name : calloc_int_matrix * Description : Allocate a dynamic int-matrix of size rows * columns ; return a pointer .
* ===================================================================================== */ int** calloc_int_matrix ( int rows , int columns ) { int i ; int **m ; m = calloc ( rows , sizeof ( int * ) ) ; /* allocate pointer array */ assert ( m != NULL ) ; /* abort if allocation failed */ *m = calloc ( rows * columns , sizeof ( int ) ) ; /* allocate data array */ assert (*m != NULL ) ; /* abort if allocation failed */ for ( i=1 ; i m[ i ] = m [ i - 1 ] + columns ; return m ; } /* ---------- end of function calloc_int_matrix
---------- */
To insert this into your working c program , type
r from the normal mode inside vim , which will prompt “ read snippet /home / ramesh/.vim/c-support/codesnippets/ ” , type calloc_int_matrix.c at the end and press enter , which will insert the content of the ~/.vim/c-support/codesnippets / calloc_int_matrix.c to your working file automatically .
Note :
You can define your own code snippets and place it under ~/.vim/c-support/codesnippets /.
You can also build your own code snippets from the existing code – select the part of code need to be made as code snippet , press
w , and give a file - name to it .
From next time , type
r and the file - name to get your custom code snippet .

Medieval manuscripts give linguists clues about more recent changes
Some of the oldest words in English have been identified , scientists say .
Reading University researchers claim " I " , " we " , " two " and " three " are among the most ancient , dating back tens of thousands of years .
Their computer model analyses the rate of change of words in English and the languages that share a common heritage .
The team says it can predict which words are likely to become extinct - citing " squeeze " , " guts " , " stick " and " bad " as probable first casualties .
" We use a computer to fit a range of models that tell us how rapidly these words evolve , " said Mark Pagel , an evolutionary biologist at the University of Reading .
" We fit a wide range , so there 's a lot of computation involved ; and that range then brackets what the true answer is and we can estimate the rates at which these things are replaced through time . "
Sound and concept Across the Indo - European languages - which include most of the languages spoken from Europe to the Asian subcontinent - the vocal sound made to express a given concept can be similar .
New spoken words for a concept can arise in a given language , utilising different sounds , in turn giving a clue to a word 's relative age in the language .
At the root of the Reading University effort is a lexicon of 200 words that is not specific to culture or technology , and is therefore likely to represent concepts that have not changed across nations or millennia .
" We have lists of words that linguists have produced for us that tell us if two words in related languages actually derive from a common ancestral word , " said Professor Pagel .
When we speak to each other we 're playing this massive game of Chinese whispers
Mark Pagel , University of Reading " We have descriptions of the ways we think words change and their ability to change into other words , and those descriptions can be turned into a mathematical language , " he added .
The researchers used the university 's IBM supercomputer to track the known relations between words , in order to develop estimates of how long ago a given ancestral word diverged in two different languages .
They have integrated that into an algorithm that will produce a list of words relevant to a given date .
" You type in a date in the past or in the future and it will give you a list of words that would have changed going back in time or will change going into the future , " Professor Pagel told BBC News .
" From that list you can derive a phrasebook of words you could use if you tried to show up and talk to , for example , William the Conqueror . "
That is , the model provides a list of words that are unlikely to have changed from their common ancestral root by the time of William the Conqueror .
Words that have not diverged since then would comprise similar sounds to their modern descendants , whose meanings would therefore probably be recognisable on sound alone .
However , the model cannot offer a guess as to what the ancestral words were .
It can only estimate the likelihood that the sound from a modern English word might make some sense if called out during the Battle of Hastings .
Dirty business
What the researchers found was that the frequency with which a word is used relates to how slowly it changes through time , so that the most common words tend to be the oldest ones .
For example , the words " I " and " who " are among the oldest , along with the words " two " , " three " , and " five " .
The word " one " is only slightly younger .
Time - travellers would find a few sounds familiar in William 's words
The word " four " experienced a linguistic evolutionary leap that makes it significantly younger in English and different from other Indo - European languages .
Meanwhile , the fastest - changing words are projected to die out and be replaced by other words much sooner .
For example , " dirty " is a rapidly changing word ; currently there are 46 different ways of saying it in the Indo - European languages , all words that are unrelated to each other .
As a result , it is likely to die out soon in English , along with " stick " and " guts " .
Verbs also tend to change quite quickly , so " push " , " turn " , " wipe " and " stab " appear to be heading for the lexicographer 's chopping block .
Again , the model cannot predict what words may change to ; those linguistic changes are according to Professor Pagel " anybody 's guess " .
High fidelity " We think some of these words are as ancient as 40,000 years old .
The sound used to make those words would have been used by all speakers of the Indo - European languages throughout history , " Professor Pagel said .
" Here 's a sound that has been connected to a meaning - and it's a mostly arbitrary connection - yet that sound has persisted for those tens of thousands of years . "
The work casts an interesting light on the connection between concepts and language in the human brain , and provides an insight into the evolution of a dynamic set of words .
" If you 've ever played ' Chinese whispers ' , what comes out the end is usually gibberish , and more or less when we speak to each other we 're playing this massive game of Chinese whispers .
Yet our language can somehow retain its fidelity . "

According to Finnish psychologist Atti Revonsuo , nightmares are actually positive experiences and even more – they are crucial for human race to survive .
He claims all nightmares – like of falling down , being chased by monstrous animals , losing teeth or getting kicked out of school – emerge from our collective unconscious that contains experiences of human civilization repeatedly confronted with perilous challenges over the history .
Nightmares are a kind of training for facing real - life dangers .
Experiences we get from nightmares make us less vulnerable to possible sudden turn of events .
According to Revonsuo , nightmares create necessary nervous bonds in our subconscious mind ensuring we act effectively and almost by instinct in moments of extreme danger .
So when you wake up from nightmare next time , you ’d better think of all benefits it brings to you .

The energy agenda is a welcomed change showing a future outlook that is based , at least to some [ small ] extent , on the physical realities of the natural resource world .
However , from the perspective of net energy , some potential problems do exist .
My goal here is to discuss some possible shortcomings of the new administrations energy agenda from the perspective of net energy .
The Obama energy agenda focuses on - and these are not mutually exclusive - efficiency , electrification , and the promotion of alternative energy resources .
Its five main goals are set up in a way so that success in any one of the five individual areas will reinforce the other 4 , helping the overall agenda achieve success .
For example , creating 25 % of the U.S. electricity production from renewable resources ( goal # 4 ) will aid in decreasing the U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 80 % ( goal # 5 ) .
1 ) Help create five million new jobs by strategically investing $ 150 billion over the next ten years to catalyze private efforts to build a clean energy future
With a recession in full swing and the recent announcement of thousands of job losses at major companies within the United States , creating jobs has become mission number 1 of the new Obama administration .
In the meantime , the collapse of the stock market has made raising capital the number one problem for the alternative energy sector .
The primary goal of the Obama plan is to bolster the alternative energy sector of the economy by injecting $ 150 billion dollars of capital into alternative energy companies / programs , and in doing so create 5 million [ permanent ] jobs .
The situation , as seen from the perspective of net energy , is as follows : any alternative technology with a reasonably high EROI is usually profitable , and if something is profitable it will not have trouble sustaining growth long after the 150 billion dollars is spent .
For example , the growth of wind farms ( EROI ≈ 18:1 ) in the U.S. has outpaced every other country in the world for the past 4 years , and in 2008 the U.S. passed Germany with the World ’s largest installed wind power capacity .
With a little help to bolster new wind power companies in these tough economic times , I believe that the moderately high EROI of wind power could translate to sustained profits and this industry should grow into the distant future , and as a result create long - lasting jobs .
The same probably could be said for solar , geothermal , and bioenergy ( for burning – but not ethanol ) .
On the other hand , lets look at alternative energy technologies with very low EROI ’s .
Corn - based ethanol is argued to have an EROI between 1.2 and 1.6 to 1 .
These low EROI values mean that the corn-ethanol industry is operating at the margin of positive energy returns , and because of that fact , the industry as a whole is vulnerable to shocks .
For example , Verasun , one of the largest ethanol companies in the U.S. , filed recently for bankruptcy , Aventine Renewable Energy and Pacific Ethanol have both lost about 80 % of their value , BioFuel Energy lost 46 million dollars on poor hedges on commodity prices , and the list goes on ...
The financial collapse and the reduction in the price of oil had a large negative impact for these companies , which is exactly the point : negative disruptions in financial markets or in the price of oil will have magnified impacts in this industry due to the fact that the energy surplus contained within the ethanol product is marginal at best .
Ironically , the large increase in energy prices that encouraged alternatives probably had something to do with the financial collapse that made them no longer feasible economically .
2 ) Within 10 years save more oil than we currently import from the Middle East and Venezuela combined
Decreasing the amount of oil we import from unstable regions is always a good idea from a political standpoint , but that may not hold true from a net energy perspective .
It is a good idea from the net energy perspective if the decrease in imports from Venezuela and the Middle East is met by a similar decrease in consumption within the United States .
It is a bad idea if the decrease is compensated by an increase in imports from “ friendly ” countries , that have generally , at least when compared to the Middle East , poorer quality resources that emit much more CO 2 .
For example , Canada is the largest foreign supplier of oil to the United States , and much of their future oil production resides in the tar sands of northern Alberta .
The EROI of developing oil from the tar sands is between 2 to 5:1 .
Compare that with oil from the Middle East , which has an EROI of roughly 20:1 .
This large difference in EROI impacts the difference between “ gross ” and “ net ” oil deliverables .
Using an equation from Mulder and Hagens ( 2008 ) , I can estimate the gross energy extracted to deliver one unit of net energy for any EROI value .
The equation is :
Gross Extraction = EROI / ( EROI – 1 )
Using this metric , to deliver one net unit of oil from the Middle East would require the gross extraction of 1.05 barrels of oil equivalent ( boe ) , while in Canada the same net delivery would require the gross extraction of 1.25 boe .
In the end , Canada would need to extract roughly 20 % more boe than the Middle East to deliver the same amount of net oil to the U.S. Currently the U.S. imports 790 million barrels per year from the Middle East ( defined here as the “ Persian Gulf ” , including : Bahrain , Iran , Iraq , Kuwait , Qatar , Saudi Arabia , and the United Arab Emirates ) .
The gross extraction cost of this fuel in the Middle East is 40 million boe , while in Canada it would be 198 million boe , a difference of 158 million boe .
Low EROIs quickly add up to high extraction costs , and although the low EROIs do not currently impact price , they will certainly impact the net ultimate recoverable oil from any given basin .
For example , the tar sands have roughly 170 billion barrels of proved reserves , and extracting that oil at an EROI of 5:1 will mean that 42.5 billion boe will be used just to extract and deliver the other 127.5 .
3 ) Put 1 million Plug - In Hybrid cars -- cars that can get up to 150 miles per gallon -- on the road by 2015 , cars that we will work to make sure are built here in America
Plug - in hybrid cars are an efficiency improvement for our transportation system as a whole , and matched with the production of electricity from renewable technologies , they represent a large step away from a fossil - fuel intensive transportation system .
Electricity has a higher quality than oil or gasoline in that it can be converted into mechanical work at higher efficiencies than can internal combustion engines , which are limited to Carnot efficiencies , and it can be transported long distances much easier than oil or gasoline .
For these reasons the high - speed trains in Europe and Japan use electricity for power rather than fossil fuels directly .
Hence electricity driven transport is an efficiency improvement over the internal combustion engine .
Most important , however , is that electricity can be produced from wind , solar , geothermal , and other renewable sources .
Currently , however , much of the electricity in the U.S. is produced from fossil fuels , and without a switch to renewable sources of electricity , a move to electric vehicles will only shift the emission of greenhouse gases from the tailpipe to the smokestack .
From a net energy perspective , electric vehicles make sense as they increase efficiency , but the biggest variable in this equation is making the electricity grid technologically capable of effectively transmitting wind and solar power to car batteries without large transmission ( entropic ) losses .
We need to undertake much more comprehensive EROI assessments if we are to understand these relations well .
4 ) Ensure 10 percent of our electricity comes from renewable sources by 2012 , and 25 percent by 2025
The 2012 goal will not be difficult to meet , as 9 % of the nameplate capacity of the electrical system in the U.S. is produced from renewable resources already ( renewable defined as : hydroelectricity , wind , solar , and geothermal ) .
Continually increasing the amount of electricity that comes from renewable sources will indeed make meeting all the other goals much easier , and much like the conclusion from number 3 , the important aspect from the net energy perspective is whether the U.S. can establish an electricity infrastructure that will allow for effective transmission of electricity from places of production to places of consumption , because places where the sun shines the most or the wind blows the hardest are usually places were people do n’t live .
Questions like the following become overwhelmingly important : what is the energy cost of upgrading transmission lines , and how will that affect the EROI of the renewable energy technologies that utilize those lines ?
5 ) Implement an economy - wide cap - and - trade program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent by 2050
A successful cap and trade program is needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
I am wary , however , that too much emphasis is being placed on the future of carbon capture “ technology ” while decreasing consumption is being overlooked .
Much attention has been given to carbon capture technologies , such as carbon capture and sequestration ( CCS ) , without much regard for its impact on production efficiency or the extreme costs of building such facilities .
CCS technology decreases the power output of a plant by about 30 % ( see Michael Webber ) .
In other words , the U.S. would have to burn 30 % more fuel just to maintain the same level of power output .
I am also skeptical of storing pressurized carbon dioxide underground – see Law of Unintended Consequences .
In the end , maybe trading carbon - dioxide emissions for lower efficiency is the best option , but it will come at a high net energy cost .

Mi sembra che una buona posizione sulla situazione di Gaza si quella suggerita da Gilioli :
Il fatto è che la complessità e le infinite varianti di un conflitto in corso da quando qui avevamo ancora De Gasperi sono largamente superiori alla quantità di letture e di esperienze che ho fatto in merito
[…]
Ecco : la quantificazione delle ragioni e dei torti in quel conflitto mi pare più indicibile della metafisica secondo Wittgenstein .
Quindi , sto semplicemente zitto per limitare il numero di cazzate che già abitualmente riverso in queste pagine .
Questo non vuol dire che non abbia una mia posizione e una mia idea su ciò che sta succedendo , ma solo che non vorrei aggiungere altro alle banalità e stupidaggini che si sentono in queste occasioni , perchè avendo troppe cose da dire si rischia di essere confusi e poco efficaci .
Piuttosto , penso sia più utile segnalarvi qualche articolo interessante : un giornalista dell ’
Indipendent perde il padre nei bombardamenti , l’invito a Israele a smettere di pensare in termini militari , una descrizione di Hamas un po ’ diversa dall ’immagine stereotipata che ne abbiamo ; e questo post di Leonardo , di rara chiarezza e passione , da leggere fino in fondo .
Infine vi invito a non utilizzare solo i canali tradizionali per informarvi sul conflitto in corso , ma anche quelli messi a disposizione da Internet : twitter e flickr , per esempio , danno un ’idea di cosa sta succedendo attraverso le parole e le immagini di chi vive lì .
The discovery , made over the weekend , prompted Bullion Reserve to file a bankruptcy petition Monday in Los Angeles , seeking court protection from its creditors .
Patrick Lynch , president of the Salt Lake City company , said that in the three years he had stored bullion for Mr. Saxon , the most he had ever seen in the vaults was about $ 3 million .
He said it was standard practice for his company to register the bars by their serial numbers .
A Brinks executive in Los Angeles said he had been advised by his lawyers not to comment .
Where the millions of dollars in customers ' money went is unclear .
Robert Abrams , Attorney General of New York , said his office had been flooded with calls about the company .
His office has been investigating Bullion Reserve , which advertised heavily in the New York area , for several weeks , and the investigation is continuing .
There were reports from Mr. Abrams 's office that Mr. Saxon , his wife and others closely identified with the gold dealer had received $ 41 million in loans from the company .
And the auditors ' report said '' millions of dollars ' ' in loans had been made to Mr. Saxon .
But a laywer retained by the company said he had no such informa tion .
Lawsuits have been filed seeking to recover $ 23 million in cash , jewelry and other assets from the company .
The largest seeks to seize $ 16.4 million in assets , including three luxury cars and two condominiums owned by Mr. Saxon 's wife and his estate .

It was started by Hasan Al - Banna .
It is a global organization with presence in the United States .
Most members in America keep their identity hidden .
It was outlawed in Egypt for a number of years because of their supremacist and sometimes radicals views until the uprising there earlier this year .
I suspect these recent " freedom " revolutions will be used by the Brotherhood for their own benefit and advancement by appealing to all who want freedom ( but many do not have ) claiming they also support freedom but it is an Islamic supremacist organization .
I suggest a review of some of Al - Banna 's writings found on a Canadian website used by impressionable Muslim youth .
Read Al - Banna 's call for Jihad .
The Young Muslims ( Brotherhood ? ?? ) of Canada website claims to have copywrited the Arabic translations of Al - Banna 's work into English .
Sayyid ( Syed ) Qutb , an early Muslim Brotherhood leader and activist whose book Milestones ( Ma'alim fi al - Tariq ) is also posted , too .
This book led to his state imposed death in Egypt shortly after it was published in the 60s .
Qutb intensely disliked the West , like Al - Banna , who both felt man-made laws were far inferior to sharia law ( a cornerstone of Islamic supremacy or Islamism ) .
It 's believed Qutb may have heavily influenced Al Qaeda ( PBS ) .
In October of 2010 , the Muslim Brotherhood 's supreme guide ?
confirmed in a sermon their hate for the U.S. and that jihad was necessary .
??
On the 21st of January he wrote ?? in Arabic about jihad against injustice ( translated by google ) is necessary even if it costs them their lives and discussed the eminence of pursuing major powers .
Here 's a link to a recent interview ( YouTube ) by CNN of a couple female Egyptians whose hatred for the U.S. and Israel is similar to many in the Middle East .
They are branwashed by an Islamisic supremacist mindset , IMO .
The Muslim Brotherhood branch in Palestine created Hamas in or around 1987 , whose written goals is to destroy Israel for Islam .
Read The Covenant of the Islamic Resistance Movement at Yale Law School .
In December 2008 , an article appeared on Al Arabiya News Channel Egypt 's Muslim Brotherhood calls for Jihad .
The article is not available on the website now but the pdf file of it is online .
The Muslim Brotherhood has been active in the U.S. since the 60s and set up several national organizations for political activism to further their goals , increase their political influence and , less overtly , advance their supremacist goals .
Their detailed plans to destroy America for Islamic supremacy was discovered by the FBI in 2004 in a search of the home of Ismail Selim Elbarasse ( see the plan below ) .
This plan was a summation of goals already achieved and what they planned to achieve in the future .
It was written in 1991 so it was in place a long time .
Like - minded Muslims here do not openly speak of their support for the Islamic supremacist ideals of the Muslim Brotherhood and will go to great length to give us a different impression .
Do all Muslims believe this ideology ?
No .
One out - spoken anti-Islamist Muslim activist is Dr. Zuhdi Jasser , a physician from Arizona who is president of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy .
Most Islamists here go after him with vicious and ridiculous criticism .
Also , most Islamists will attack their critics with name - calling buzz words like bigots , hate - mongers , Islamophobes and refuse to discuss the SUBSTANCE of the criticism .
Complicating their subversive threat in the U.S. are those on the far - left who down - play Islamism and this threat and call critics the sames hateful names as Islamists here do .
They help enable these Islamist organizations to further their shared anti-American agendas , I guess .
A Muslim Brotherhood document submitted in the Holy Land Foundation terror funding trial reviews briefly their history in America .
It 's in their own words .
I recently found some Muslim Brotherhood writings posted at the University of Maryland by Rasayil Al - Imam Al - Shahid ( this is an archived webcopy because the originals have been removed ) that were posted by graduate student , Kareem Darwish , who appears to be working for Microsoft in Cairo now .
A 1994 written agenda for a meeting of the Muslim Brotherhood 's Palestine Committee actually mentions CAIR ( the Council on American Islamic Relations ) and other MB organizations .
They wrote America was the ideal location to support their movement worldwide .
Check out copies of several paid checks from Hamas leader Mousa Marzook to the Islamic Association of Palestine ( IAP ) , an overt arm of the Muslim Brotherhood .
Linking CAIR to the MB also are the IAP leaders who started CAIR , Nihad Awad and Omar Ahmed .
A 1992 Internal memo of the Islamic Association of Palestine states : Download IAP1192 ( GOVERNMENT EXHIBIT 3:04 -CR-2404 U.S. v. HLF , et. , " ) .. Like other Western , Arab and Islamic arenas , the American arena has seen a move for action for the Palestinian cause by the grace of God and due to the presence of the Islamic Movement and its pioneer the Muslim Brotherhood Movement .
The first organizational frame for Islamic action for Palestine came in the beginning of the eighties when the leadership of the Movement decided to establish the " Islamic Association of Palestine in North America " .
A 1993 Palestine Committee document states it was formed by the Muslim Brotherhood ( U.S. vs. HLF , Exhibit 003-0017 ) .
They wrote of the Islamic Association of Palestine on page 8 .
In a Muslim Brotherhood phone book ( U.S. vs. HLF Asqar Search 1 ) it lists Sadoun as living in Tulsa , Nihad Awad , CAIR 's Executive Director is listed along with Ahmad ( Ahmed ) Agha of Ponca City , # 34 , 32 , and 24 respectivel .
In an article at the Forth Worth Star from 1994 , Nihad Awad was reported as being the spokeperson of the Islamic Association of Palestine : Download Fort Worth Star1994
In 2008 , at the Holy Land Foundation terror - funding trial the Dallas Morning News Crime Blog reported : FBI : CAIR is a front group , and Holy Land Foundation tapped Hamas clerics for fundraisers .
It 's been my experience during my five years of research and self - education about Islamism that Islamists are not truthful when questioned about the Muslim Brotherhood infiltration in the United States .
Listen to CAIR Oklahoma 's director , Muneer Awad squirm with irritation when asked .
Also , if they are call - out about something they wrote that 's worrisome they will likely remove the webpage so its important to capture it .
On February 23rd or so , the Muslim Brotherhood wrote on their Arabic website : " ... All people of Egypt join protest tomorrow ; " the global anti-globalization of American hegemony & Zionism ... Global Movement for protests to be set up in Algeria , Syria , Bahrain , Yemen and Morocco ... that the Arab armies must prepare for war ... "
In other articles or interviews , they will flatly deny these things .

House Intelligence Committee member reveals secret Iraq trip on Twitter Jeremy Gantz
Published : Saturday February 7 , 2009
Print This Email This Forget anonymous leaks -- official Twitter feeds are now a source of government information .
Rep. Peter Hoekstra , R - Mich. , helped the increasingly popular micro-blogging outlet reach a new milestone Friday , when he reported on a congressional trip to Iraq on his Twitter feed -- a trip that was allegedly supposed to be a secret .
" Heading to Iraq and Afghanistan weds night .
I 'll update on twitter and web pg as links are available .
I 'll ne back in touch mid next week , " the House Intelligence Committee member wrote Tuesday .
And then , one day later , the Republican wrote : " Just landed in Baghdad .
I believe it may be first time I 've had bb service in Iraq . 11 th trip here . "
Both of those " tweets , " along with others , went against what Hoekstra had been told before leaving Washington D.C. : to keep the trip a secret .
Various media outlets , including Congressional Quarterly and the Watertown Daily Times , had agreed not to disclose the trip until the the congressional delegation left Iraq .
But Hoekstra broke the story himself , so the Agence France Press noticed the representative 's public - record tweets and reported on the trip .
After averaging 2 - 3 tweets per day earlier in the week , Hoekstra has n't posted since Friday afternoon -- thought he later began posting again , after this original article went to press .
But the delegation 's trip appeared to be an educational one , according to Hoekstra 's last Friday tweet : " Iraq !
Issues !
lLong term impact on containing Iran ..
Need a coherent detainee strategy .
Amb Crocker leaving after very successful tenure . "
Jamal Ware , a Hoekstra spokesman , said the congressman " was not told he could not post prior to or during the trip .
He continued to do so as possible for the remainder of it , contrary to [ your original piece ] . "
Correction :
The trip to Iraq was not classified , as had been stated in an original edition of this piece .
Hoekstra 's spokesman says he was not told to keep the trip secret , as other media organizations have maintained .
CVS Caremark has agreed to settle Federal Trade Commission charges that it failed to take reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect the sensitive financial and medical information of its customers and employees , in violation of federal law .
In a separate but related agreement , the company ’s pharmacy chain also has agreed to pay $ 2.25 million to resolve Department of Health and Human Services allegations that it violated the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) .
" This is a case that will restore appropriate privacy protections to tens of millions of people across the country , " said William E. Kovacic , Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission .
" It also sends a strong message to other organizations that possess consumers ' protected personal information .
They are required to secure consumers ' private information . "
CVS Caremark operates the largest pharmacy chain in the United States , with more than 6,300 retail outlets and online and mail - order pharmacy businesses .
The FTC opened its investigation into CVS Caremark following media reports from around the country that its pharmacies were throwing trash into open dumpsters that contained pill bottles with patient names , addresses , prescribing physicians ’ names , medication and dosages ; medication instruction sheets with personal information ; computer order information from the pharmacies , including consumers ’ personal information ; employment applications , including social security numbers ; payroll information ; and credit card and insurance card information , including , in some cases , account numbers and driver ’s license numbers .
At the same time , HHS opened its investigation into the pharmacies ’ disposal of health information protected by HIPAA .
The FTC and HHS coordinated their investigations and settlements .
The FTC ’s complaint charges that CVS Caremark failed to implement reasonable and appropriate procedures for handling personal information about customers and employees , in violation of federal laws .
In particular , according to the complaint , CVS Caremark did not implement reasonable policies and procedures to dispose securely of personal information , did not adequately train employees , did not use reasonable measures to assess compliance with its policies and procedures for disposing of personal information , and did not employ a reasonable process for discovering and remedying risks to personal information .
CVS Caremark made claims such as “ CVS / pharmacy wants you to know that nothing is more central to our operations than maintaining the privacy of your health information . ”
The FTC alleged that the claim was deceptive and that CVS Caremark ’s security practices also were unfair .
Unfair and deceptive practices violate the FTC Act .
The FTC order requires CVS Caremark to establish , implement , and maintain a comprehensive information security program designed to protect the security , confidentiality , and integrity of the personal information it collects from consumers and employees .
It also requires the company to obtain , every two years for the next 20 years , an audit from a qualified , independent , third - party professional to ensure that its security program meets the standards of the order .
CVS Caremark will be subject to standard record - keeping and reporting provisions to allow the FTC to monitor compliance .
Finally , the settlement bars future misrepresentations of the company ’s security practices .
The HHS settlement requires CVS pharmacies to establish and implement policies and procedures for disposing of protected health information , implement a training program for handling and disposing of such patient information , conduct internal monitoring , and engage an outside independent assessor to evaluate compliance for three years .
CVS also will pay HHS $ 2.25 million to settle the matter http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2009pres/02/20090218a.html.
The Commission vote to accept the proposed consent agreement was 4 - 0 .
The FTC will publish an announcement regarding the agreement in the Federal Register shortly .
The agreement will be subject to public comment for 30 days , beginning today and continuing through March 20 , 2009 , after which the Commission will decide whether to make it final .
Comments should be addressed to the FTC , Office of the Secretary , Room H- 135 , 600 Pennsylvania Avenue , N.W. , Washington , DC 20580 .
The FTC is requesting that any comment filed in paper form near the end of the public comment period be sent by courier or overnight service , if possible , because U.S. postal mail in the Washington area and at the Commission is subject to delay due to heightened security precautions .
Copies of the complaint , proposed consent agreement , and an analysis of the agreement to aid in public comment are available from the FTC ’s Web site at http://www.ftc.gov and also from the FTC ’s Consumer Response Center , Room 130 , 600 Pennsylvania Avenue , N.W. , Washington , D.C. 20580

Kingsley is the girl featured in the 30 - second porn clip that surprised 80,000 Comcast customers in the Tucson area during the Super Bowl on Sunday .
The stealth porn attack turned out , in effect , to be the game 's most effective Super Bowl ad ; and it did n't cost her employer , Jenna Jameson 's Jenna Club , a thing .

Israeli Apartheid Week 2020 unites struggles worldwide
# UnitedAgainstRacism
IAW 2020 moved online to continue the fight against racism and apartheid .
We ’re staying home , but we ’re not staying silent !
This year ’s Israeli Apartheid Week ( IAW ) moved online following the outbreak of Covid - 19 and the lockdown measures to contain its spread .
Under the theme # UnitedAgainstRacism , events worldwide focused on the fight against all forms of racism , marginalization and oppression , and promoting Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions ( BDS ) for Palestinian freedom , justice and equality .
Opening IAW 2020 , social justice activist and anti-racism campaigner Dr. Angela Davis called on people everywhere to unite their anti-racist struggles stating that “ If justice is indivisible , it follows that our struggles against injustice must be united . ”
Following this call for unity over 100 civil society groups from across Europe endorsed Israeli Apartheid Week call to action .
Hundreds of cities had planned events for Israeli Apartheid Week – protests , campaign calls for action , film screenings and conferences .
Even if the physical events did not take place , valuable relationships and connections were forged with antiracist and anti-colonialist groups all over the world who were also involved in organising these events .
An online event with South African Chief and ANC MP Mandla Mandela and afrofeminist activist Desirée Bela - Lobedde attracted an audience of over 1000 from over 38 countries , and a further 10,000 ( and counting ) have watched the recorded event to date .
Four more webinars about militarisation in Latin America , security and racism in times of pandemic , and resistance to the Trump - Netanyahu annexation plan were held , with a wide variety of amazing speakers such as Noura Erakat ( US ) , Budour Hassan ( Palestine ) , Khury Petersen - Smith ( US ) , Rosa Herrera ( Argentina ) , Apoorva Gautam ( India ) , Yara Hawari ( Palestine ) , Rebecca Vilkomerson ( US ) , Samah Idriss ( Lebanon ) and Omar Barghouti ( Palestine ) .
Even though the COVID - 19 crisis affected IAW organising , IAW organisers adjusted beautifully and creatively to the situation , turning this crisis into an opportunity to connect with those who are far away from us .
In our lockdowns , we stayed home but not silent because our solidarity has no barriers .
Real Money Saving Tips in a Turbulent Economy
by Bill Sardi by Bill Sardi
DIGG THIS
No sense letting thousands of hard - earned dollars slither away at the time when they are becoming more scarce .
The cost of food has risen 6 % and energy 29 % in the past year .
Here is a list of suggestions I have developed on how to save money , mainly by buying products of better value and durability .
Many years ago drug stores used to sell razor blades that lasted a whole year or more .
Consumers had to ask for them as they were kept behind the counter .
Eventually these durable razor blades were no longer made .
Today you can purchase longer - lasting razor blades that have been cryogenically tempered ( frozen ) down to — 300 F to improve the durability of the blade .
These are the same blades you now buy ( Gillette , Schick , etc ) but cold treated .
They last for many months says the manufacturer , depending upon the thickness of your beard .
Have you ever bought a pair of Mephisto shoes ?
Try their loafers .
These are pricy shoes , around $ 370 , but they are built to last a long time and not look worn .
The $ 370 Mephisto shoe : but it looks like new for years
I ’ve had a pair of Mephisto loafers I wear often , particularly when I travel ( easy on , easy off at airport security check points ) and they look like new 8 years after I purchased them .
Mephisto will also re-sole and re-condition your shoes after years of use .
OK , it ’s time cut your own hair .
Saves on gasoline and time too .
Wahl hair clippers will show you how .
Plumber ’s snake saves calling the plumber
It ’s also time to think about doing more of your own home repairs .
A common one is opening a clogged drain or toilet .
All the plumber brings with him for this chore is a " snake " which can be purchased at most hardware supply stores .
For instructions how to unclog drains , read here .
Care to gain 15 more miles per gallon , or 200 miles per tank of gasoline without fuel additives or adding parts to your carburetor ?

Compact Fluorescent Bulb vs Bulb Standard Bulb ( Source : GE ) 15w=60w 20w=75w 26w—29w=100w 38w—42w=150w 55w= 250w— 300w
Strange how often we overlook putting into practice known ways to save money .
Energy - saving light bulbs ( compact fluorescent lamps or CLFs ) are an example .
A friend of mine bought these bulbs at Walgreen ’s on special at 35 cents each and replaced 42 of them in his home .
The projected energy cost savings are $ 47 over the 10,000 - hour life of the bulb .
So 42 CFL bulbs will produce $ 1,974 in savings for a $ 14.70 total purchase .
$ 14 produces $ 1,900 !
In this instance , there are 8760 hours in one year .
And of course , most of the light bulbs in my friend ’s home are on only 3 to 4 hours a day .
Since they burn only for a portion of the day or night , he assumes those savings will be earned over a 4 - year period .
This means he saves $ 494 a year for 4 years for an original investment of $ 14 .
We bought a large house a few years ago and were shocked at our first electric bill — ~ $ 700 !
The house has 230 overhead lights .
We swapped out conventional light bulbs for the compact fluorescents and saved ~ $ 300 a month .
Large families can purchase bigger packages ( 25— 50 lb bags ) or even smaller boxes of pancake mixes , cereals , beans and mixes , saving in the process .
A good source is Honeyville Grain .
Here ’s the really good part , Honeyville ships your entire order anywhere in the contiguous United States for only $ 4.49 .
That ’s right , you pay just $ 4.49 for shipping regardless of how much you order .
Another economical source for grains , seeds , beans , and cereals is Bob ’s Red Mill .
Vitamin pills are a part of most Americans daily health regimen .
Most Americans will opt for the convenience of vitamin C , fish oil , and magnesium , in pills .
However , there are great savings when purchasing powdered vitamin C or magnesium , or liquid fish ( lemon flavored ) or flaxseed oil ( lemon flavored ) consumed by the spoonful rather than as encapsulated supplements .
Many people are considering higher deductibles for their health insurance policy .
Health insurance just pays the bills , you are n’t any healthier for buying insurance .
A day in sickbay is costly .
In lieu of problematic antibiotics and vaccines , and costly doctor ’s office visits , particularly in the winter cold and flu season , learn to provide your children with vitamin D3 tablets , 1000 international units every day , and more when ill ( 2000 — 5000 IU ) .
Only recently has it been discovered that vitamin D produces antibiotic peptides in the body that attack germs ( viruses , bacteria , fungi ) .
Fifteen vitamin D experts just published a paper saying every child in America ought to be given 1000 IU of vitamin D3 per day .
A recently published report shows 2000 IU of vitamin D3 completely abolishes the occurrence of upper respiratory infections in adults during winter months .
[ Annals Otology , Rhinology & Laryngology Vol. 117 : pages 864—70 , 2008 ]
Your family will need 1000 IU vitamin D3 tablets for the kids ( 6 cents per tablet ) , or liquid vitamin D3 for infants , or 5000 IU vitamin D3 capsules ( 7.3 cents per capsule ) — the adult dosage suggested by The Vitamin D Council — all which are difficult to find in retail stores .
By shopping online here you can obtain all these vitamin D products .
A free family guide to Vitamin D written by this author is available here .
( My wife operates this business . )
By the way , vitamin D3 does not cause germ resistance as does penicillin or other man-made antibiotics .
I ’ve bought a lot of business suits over my lifetime .
They do n’t all seem to last .
The threads only can endure so many dry cleanings .
I never knew this before , but the most important quality of a good suit is a jacket that has a full canvas layer between the fabric and lining .
Michael Ostrove , senior vice president at men ’s retailer Paul Stuart , explains this in a recent issue of Forbes Magazine online .
Cheaper suits have a lining that is fused or glued to the fabric .
“ Full canvas conforms better to the human body after multiple wears , ” Ostrove says .
“ When the jacket is glued or fused it does n’t fit or wear as well . ”
Ostrove says you can test to see if the jacket is full - canvas .
Pinch the layers of fabric between the button holes .
If you feel three layers it is full canvas , two layers is half canvas and one layer means the lining is fused or glued .

Over the years I hated having to take even a half - day to go to the shop to have a new set of tires put on my car .
Time is money .
I found that Michelin tires often lasted the life of my cars and were worth the extra price .
Michelin loves to brag about its Premier HydroEdge® passenger tires and their 90,000 - mile warranty , over 30,000 miles better wear than competing brands ( that ’s a whole set of cheap tires for free ) .
Money well spent .
I got 150,000 miles out of one set of Michelin tires , with tread left to spare .
Grocery stores often lure shoppers with loss leaders .
Wise shoppers can follow these economical offers , stock up on these items and save money .
This follows an old dictum : " Store what you eat , and eat what you store . "

Remember all that loose cash in Iraq that floated around and was never accounted for ?
Bricks and bricks of $ 100 bills , millions stuffed into sacks that were never subjected to any oversight whatsoever ?
Millions that could have been put toward more , um , constructive projects ?
Yeah , me too :
Federal authorities examining the early , chaotic days of the $ 125 billion American - led effort to rebuild Iraq have significantly broadened their inquiry to include senior American military officers who oversaw the program , according to interviews with senior government officials and court documents .
Court records show that last month investigators subpoenaed the personal bank records of Col. Anthony B. Bell , who is now retired from the Army but who was in charge of reconstruction contracting in Iraq in 2003 and 2004 when the small operation grew into a frenzied attempt to remake the country ’s broken infrastructure .
In addition , investigators are examining the activities of Lt. Col. Ronald W. Hirtle of the Air Force , who was a senior contracting officer in Baghdad in 2004 , according to two federal officials involved in the inquiry .
It is not clear what specific evidence exists against the two men , and both said they had nothing to hide from investigators .
Yet officials say that several criminal cases over the past few years point to widespread corruption in the operation the men helped to run .
[ T]ens of thousands of dollars stuffed into pizza boxes and delivered surreptitiously to the American contracting offices in Baghdad , and payoffs made in paper sacks that were scattered in “ dead drops ” around the Green Zone , the nerve center of the United States government ’s presence in Iraq ...
Prosecutors have won 35 convictions on cases related to reconstruction in Iraq , yet most of them involved private contractors or midlevel officials .
The current inquiry is aiming at higher - level officials , according to investigators involved in the case , and is also trying to determine if there are connections between those officials and figures in the other cases .
The reconstruction effort , intended to improve services and convince Iraqis of American good will , largely managed to do neither .
The wider investigation raises the question of whether American corruption was a primary factor in damaging an effort whose failures have been ascribed to poor planning and unforeseen violence .
What kind of corruption ?
Why , thank you for asking .
This kind :
And guess what ?
They 're inching up the military hierarchy to find answers :
But wait !
What 's this I hear about blaming the failures in Iraq on poor planning and unforeseen violence ?
Not necessarily so , you say ?
Come on , how bad could it really be ?
Hint : Trick or treat !
The investigations , which are being conducted by the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction , the Justice Department , the Army ’s Criminal Investigation Command and other federal agencies , cover a period when millions of dollars in cash , often in stacks of shrink - wrapped bricks of $ 100 bills , were dispensed from a loosely guarded safe in the basement of one of Saddam Hussein ’s former palaces .
Former American officials describe payments to local contractors from huge sums of cash dumped onto tables and stuffed into sacks as if it were Halloween candy .
“ You had no oversight , chaos and breathtaking sums of money , ” said Senator Claire McCaskill , a Missouri Democrat who helped create the Wartime Contracting Commission , an oversight board . “
And over all of that was the notion that failure was O.K .
It does n’t get any better for criminals than that set of circumstances . ”
Brick by brick ...
Following the murders of a lawyer and journalist in Moscow , the BBC's Rupert Wingfield - Hayes asks why little appears to have been done to find those responsible .
Russia has a population of 142.8 million ( UN , 2008 ) There is a tendency for many to resort to stereotypes when describing Russia .
The Fleet Street headline writers rarely resist an opportunity to declare the outbreak of a new Cold War .
This week there was much chortling in British newspapers at the story of a Russian airline pilot who had been forced off a plane because he was too drunk to make the safety announcement .
These Russians , many will have giggled , they will never change .
It is a problem I have struggled with for the last two years .
How to describe this huge , complex and often frightening country ?
When bad things happen , like the murder of Alexander Litvinenko , there is a tendency for all of us to see it as a vast conspiracy : the work of KGB agents acting on orders straight from the Kremlin .
Daylight murder
In recent days I have had cause to look hard at that version of Russia and to ask again , what is the nature of this place ?
The reason has been the cold - blooded murder of two brave young Russians on a Moscow street .
Stanislav Markelov was a 34 - year - old human rights lawyer .
Mr Markelov had worked on many high profile human rights cases
He campaigned for all sorts of people , but most notably for Chechens brutalized in the two wars Moscow has fought to prevent their tiny republic from breaking away .
The other was Anastasia Baburova , a 25 - year - old journalist who investigated Russia 's growing neo -Nazi movement .
Their killings were cold and deliberate , straight from the set of a Hollywood gangster film .
In the mid-afternoon Stanislav and Anastasia were walking a short distance from the Kremlin .
Russia collectively shrugged its shoulders and looked the other way
A young man approached them , pulled a ski mask over his face and a silenced pistol from his pocket .
He shot Stanislav in the head killing him instantly .
As Anastasia tried to grab the killer he turned and shot her too .
She survived for a few more hours before dying in hospital .
Muted response Perhaps the most shocking thing about their deaths was the reaction in Russia .
As her father bent over the coffin and stroked her face , large tears rolled down his cheeks
There was no huge public outcry .
There were few banner headlines demanding justice .
Most shocking of all was the stony silence from the Kremlin .
Not a single word of condemnation came from President Dmitry Medvedev or Prime Minister Vladimir Putin .
Russia collectively shrugged its shoulders and looked the other way .
I was angry .
And then I went to Anastasia Baburova 's wake , and that made me more angry .
In Russia , wakes are held with an open coffin .
Anastasia 's face had been made up to cover the wound that killed her .
She looked doll - like amid the bouquets of flowers .
Her elderly parents shuffled forward to kiss their daughter goodbye .
As her father bent over the coffin and stroked her face , large tears rolled down his cheeks .
How could this have happened ?
Who is responsible ?
Why does nobody care ?
These were the questions that raced through my head as I walked from the funeral hall .
Divided society
In the two weeks since , I have been asking people from Moscow to Kiev those same questions .
Mr Lebedev has spoken out against corruption in Russia First I went to see Alexander Lebedev , the Russian billionaire businessman who owns the paper Anastasia and Stanislav worked for .
I asked him who he thought had ordered their killings .
In answer he described Russia as two countries , one within the other .
In one , live tens of millions of ordinary Russians , in the other live a tiny elite of officials , politicians and businessmen , who together have amassed vast fortunes running in to hundreds of billions .
They own private jets , houses across Europe , and yachts anchored on the French Riviera .
" They will " , he told me , " do anything to defend their wealth and power . "
Next I went to see a man who once worked for the Russian state prosecutor 's office .
We met furtively in a forest on the edge of Moscow .
" Would the murders of Anastasia and Stanislav ever be solved ? " I asked him .
" There is a very small chance , " he said , " just a few percent . "
" Why ? "
" In these sorts of cases an order may come down from above not to investigate , " he said .
" Why would they do that ? "
He looked at me as if I was a bit stupid .
" Because , " he said , " that might reveal the whole chain of people , right up to the one who ordered it . "
The impression that emerges is of a modern oligarchy .
One where the divisions between the state and private business have disappeared , where the security services are for hire and everybody has his price .
It is not a neo -Soviet state .
There is no grand conspiracy .
But that does not make it any less dangerous for those who stand in its way .

Competence , like truth , beauty and contact lenses , is in the eye of the beholder .
— Laurence J. Peter
The World ’s Fastest Man in 1980 , Allan Wells , would not have made the podium in the 100 - metre races at the Beijing Olympics last year .
In fact , his winning time of 10.25 would not have even qualified him for the semi-finals .
If you were a trailblazer in the world of personal computing in 1983 , you ’d be bragging about how your team had just shipped a product that offered a 5 MHz processor , a 5 MB hard drive , dual 5.25 inch floppy drives , support for up to 2 MB of RAM , a graphical user interface , and a mouse .
You ’d be bragging , of course , about the Apple Lisa , a machine that sold for the ridiculously low price of $ 9,995 .
And in 1984 , one of America ’s most influential consumer advocacy groups , the Center for Science in the Public Interest ( CSPI ) , launched an all - out war on fast - food restaurants .
According to their own press release , their goal was “ to pressure fast - food restaurants and food companies to stop frying with beef fat and tropical oils , which are high in the cholesterol - raising saturated fats that increase the risk of heart disease . ”
By 1990 , their campaign had succeeded .
Most fast food chains had significantly lowered the amount of saturated fats in their foods , and replaced them with a substitute that the CSPI had been arguing for since 1987 : trans fats .
You know that type of mutated fat this is so dangerous to humans that governments around the world are seeking to ban it ?
Yeah , that one .
Looking back not even 30 years ago , these people were leaders in their field , the best of the best , “ experts . ”
Today , we ’d more likely refer to them as unemployed hacks .
Which brings me to the first point I want to make about becoming an expert : Experts are n’t really experts .
They suck at what they do .
They just suck a little bit less than everybody else around them at the time .
Expertise as Fog
The other point I want to make about pursuing expertise is this : Expertise does not exist .
Sure , it ’s a nice label to be given if you ’re being interviewed on CNN , or if you ’re being introduced into a debate on the existence of God , but it is not something you can achieve .
If you ’ve set yourself the goal of becoming “ a Ruby on Rails expert ” , “ a blogging expert ” , or even say “ a fluent French speaker ” , you have n’t set a goal at all .
What is a blogging expert ?
Someone who makes a lot of money blogging about how to make a lot of money blogging ?
Or perhaps someone who achieves 20,000 subscribers by churning out list posts and other linkbait that do an excellent job of growing traffic , but a poor job of growing the reader ?
And if you apply for a job that requires a “ Ruby on Rails expert ” and you get hired , does that mean that you are an expert ?
Maybe all it really means is that you know just enough to convince the person that hired you .
Which does n’t actually mean you know a lot about the framework .
The best way to achieve expertise in your chosen field is to eliminate the word “ expertise ” from your lexicon .
As my seven - language - speaking friend Benny Lewis put it , in an email exchange I had with him on the subject of attaining language fluency :
If you really want to be fluent , I recommend abandoning the thought process of “ achieving fluency ” entirely .
Setting a goal of “ speak $ language fluently ” is too vague to be achievable .
It implies that some day you will reach the point where you can finally say , “ I speak Klingon fluently ! ”
But that day will never come .
You need to have more concrete goals spread across a small number of days or weeks that eventually add up to something tangible , such as , “ This week I will learn vocabulary related to objects in the house ” or , “ Today I will work on my consonant pronunciation . ”
If you think about it , is n’t all learning really language learning ?
Whether you ’re trying to achieve fluency in Italian , or building websites with Ruby on Rails , or baking designer cakes , every skill set is really just a vocabulary for self - expression .
The more you know , the more you can say .
Just like spoken language , the language of the Builder has no beginning and no end .
So the best way to improve yourself in any pursuit is to forget about “ becoming an expert ” and to instead focus on expanding your range of communication .
Ideally in a way that is clearly measurable by an outside observer .
If you want to be a “ competent Rails hacker ” , then set a goal to get one of your patches landed in the Rails trunk .
If your dream is to be a “ successful blogger ” , bring it closer to reality by aiming to publish , say , three posts per week .
And if want to be a “ world - class chessplayer ” , make it actionable by playing 10 blitz games per day in a specific opening you ’re trying to master , and analyze each game afterwards .
Be less concerned with the adjectives of success — good , great , world - class — and more concerned with taking a worthwhile next step .
The path to expertise is the path to nowhere in particular .
When you get specific , you get results .
British Jews have been attacked for expressing support for Palestinians suffering under Israeli military strikes in Gaza .
Police confirmed yesterday that they have provided protection to a number of people believed to be victims of UK - based Zionist extremists angered by expressions of solidarity with Palestinians .
Israel 's assault on Gaza has prompted a rise in anti-Semitic attacks in Britain , with more than 150 incidents reported by the Community Security Trust ( CST ) , an organisation for the protection of Jews .
But the past two weeks have also seen aggression within the Jewish community towards those sympathetic to the plight of Gaza .
Rabbi Elchenon Beck , 39 , was among six rabbis expressing support for Gaza 's Palestinians who were set upon by a gang of what they allege were Zionists while walking back from opposing rallies outside the Israeli Embassy on 6 January .
" They were shouting and pushed someone to the floor , so we called the police , " Rabbi Beck said .
" All the time they are trying to intimidate us , but we get used to it . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Rabbi Aharon Cohen , a Palestinian sympathiser and member of the anti-Zionist group Neturei Karta , had his letter box destroyed by a powerful firework after attending the peace march in Manchester this month .
Mark Gardner , of the CST , said it had not kept records of attacks within the Jewish community , but condemned those using the situation in Israel to justify violence in Britain .
" There 's passionate political debate , " he said , " but what 's vitally important is that it does not spill over so that we become participants in a war by proxy . "
j Query UI is an excellent add - on library for jQuery that provides all sorts of UI widgets , effects and behaviours .
One particularly useful function is provides is to make any element on the page draggable , so that it can be moved about with the mouse .
Because of all the features that jQuery UI provides the library is fairly large , about 450 KB uncompressed .
It is possible to only include specific parts of the library , but even the bare minimum required for the draggables feature weighs in at just over 40 KB uncompressed .
Therefore I decided to write my own lightweight draggable implementation using only jQuery .
The code is shown below :
// Make an element draggable using jQuery var makeDraggable = function ( element ) { element = jQuery ( element ) ; //
Move the element by the amount of change in the mouse position var move = function ( event ) { if ( element .
data ( ' mouseMove ' ) ) { var changeX = event .
clientX - element . data ( ' mouseX ' ) ; var changeY = event .
clientY - element . data ( ' mouseY ' ) ; var newX = parseInt ( element .
css ( ' left ' ) ) + changeX ; var newY = parseInt ( element . css ( ' top ' ) ) + changeY ; element .
css ( ' left ' , newX ) ; element .
css ( ' top ' , newY ) ; element . data ( ' mouseX ' , event . clientX ) ; element . data ( ' mouseY ' , event . clientY ) ; } } element .
mousedown ( function ( event ) { element .
data ( ' mouseMove ' , true ) ; element . data ( ' mouseX ' , event . clientX ) ; element . data ( ' mouseY ' , event . clientY ) ; } ) ; element .
parents ( ' : last ' ) . mouseup ( function ( ) { element .
data ( ' mouseMove ' , false ) ; } ) ; element .
mouseout ( move ) ; element .
mousemove ( move ) ; }
The element you pass to makeDraggable should already have absolute or fixed CSS positioning , and a top and left CSS value set .
Something like the following :
< div id=' draggable ' style= ' position : absolute ; top : 100 ; left : 200 ; padding : 50 px ; background : black ; border : 2 px solid # aaa ; ' >
This box is draggable !
< /div > < script type =" text / javascript " > makeDraggable ( jQuery ( '# draggable ' ) ) ; < / script >
Then just click on the div and move the mouse to drag it around .
Obviously it is n't as flexible as the jQuery UI version , but it is a useful alternative if you want to save on the amount of data your user 's will need to download and you do n't require any other jQuery UI features .
In the history of gaming , games have always been full of glitches .
There are always bugs that game writers complain about .
A bug could be caused by one of several factors : an overly complex gaming code , patching issues , programming mistakes , etc .
Nevertheless , there are cases that these glitches become features .
Yes , there are cases when these bugs actually make the game better than without it .
Some of the most popular glitches that have leveled up a game include :
Guile ’s handcuffs in Street Fighter II ;
The pause trick in Mega Man ;
The minus world in Super Mario Bros . ;
Unit downgrade in GTA : Liberty City Stories and Lumines ;
Nose - tackle dive in Tecmo Super Bowl .
There ’s more to the above list of game bugs that have instead become an awesome feature in the most played video games .

I wanted to bring attention to one of my passions , accessibility , and a project which aligns right to it .
Twitter has become one of the most popular and quickest social networks to integrate your university or business with .
You would think the simple 140 character limit messaging service would be available to all but there are a few issues that are hindering a certain user group in this powerful network .
This group is not intentionally neglected online but because programmers are more concerned with adding features that require a certain level of ability and managers are more concerned with saving a buck or a few hours of time this group gets overlooked .
The issues with twitter.com are not as crippling as an “ all flash ” site but these small details show when developers understand accessibility and have an attention to detail .
Do n’t get me wrong , twitter.com is far more accessible than a great deal of sites out there .
Below is a list of a few of those details , you might not agree with all of them but its these details which make the difference .
Some Twitter.com Accessibility Issues
No keyboard access to favorite / reply / delete
Lack of headings
Favoriting requires Javascript
Custom colors may not be readable
Code does n’t validate
Code could use better semantics
Password field is missing a label ; select lang missing label
Fieldsets used without legends
Layout width is static not flexible ; does n’t “ stretch ” with browser width
JavaScript required for details on latest tweet ( time , in reply to )
A great site created by Denis Lembree which is currently in alpha stage aims to fix these issues .
Using purely the public twitter API Dennis has created an accessible version of Twitter .
The site https://accessibletwitter.com/
aims to fix all of the issues above and continue to support and advocate for twitter to be accessible to all .
Below is the current progress of the project .
Items Implemented
All links are keyboard accessible
Simple , consistent layout and navigation
Works with or without JavaScript
Large default text size and high color contrast
Looks great in high or low resolution
Forms are marked up for optimal accessibility
Code is semantic , light , and adheres to Web Standards
+ More every day
Are these issues going to hinder Twitter from going mainstream ?
No , but our job as web professionals is to be the best at our craft and that means including everyone .
Take a look at the recent Yahoo ! article WebAIM Survey Shines Light on Screen Reader Usage to get an idea of the usage of these elements by screen reader users .
Most web developers / project managers have never seen a user use a screen reader on their site , if you are interested in watching one there is a video available from the November 19th Refresh Detroit meeting , it ’s pretty interesting stuff .
A users experience goes beyond their visit to your site , if something is hard to use they will tell their friends , make sure ever users experience on your site is a positive one , they will thank you .

Create AP from any laptop with wifi and ethernet card
So , you have a laptop with wifi and enternet card and you want to make " real " AP from it .
There are many ways to do this , but I like this one :
Install packages required : apt - get install dnsmasq configure /etc/dnsmasq.conf to be DHCP server for your wifi network : listen - address =192.168.42.1 dhcp-range=192.168.42.42,192.168.42.242,12h turn atheros card into master ( AP ) mode and configure new network 192.168.42.0/24 and setup masquarade : sudo sh -c " echo 1 > / proc/sys / net/ipv4/ip_forward " sudo wlanconfig ath0 destroy sudo wlanconfig ath0 create wlandev wifi0 wlanmode ap sudo iwconfig ath0 essid free4all sudo ifconfig ath0 192.168.42.1 sudo iwconfig sudo / etc / init.d / dnsmasq restart sudo iptables -- flush sudo iptables -- table nat -- flush sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE sudo iptables -A FORWARD - i eth0 - o ath0 -m state -- state RELATED , ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT sudo iptables -A FORWARD - i ath0 -o eth0 -j ACCEPT
And that 's it .
You have new 192.168.42.0/24 network on your wifi interface ath0 which is passed to eth0 ( which you should configure beforehand using dhclient eth0 or someting similar ) .
Bring wifi to every home in next year ;-)

Now I regret not becoming a massage therapist !
All those hot girls trust doctors and easily get naked in front of them !
Oh I wish I could fondle young skinny bodies without any obstacle or suspicion ...
Like the mulatto guy in this video does .
He rubs tanned back and bubble butt of such a gorgeous teen blonde babe !
Then tells her to turn over and starts massaging her perky tits with cute nipples ...
Should we call it erotic massage or porn massage , regarding what happens next ?
Apple has blocked the creators of South Park from selling an iPhone app based on the long - running cartoon series .
According to a BoingBoing post , the blog site 's " friends at South Park " said that " We first announced our iPhone App back in October , after we submitted the Application to Apple for approval .
After a couple of attempts to get the application approved , we are sad to say that our app has been rejected . "
The reason ?
The content was " potentially offensive . "
South Park ?
Potentially offensive ?
Who knew ?
Earth to Apple : South Park 's rowdy rudeness is exactly why it has been a raging success since it first stuck its finger in our collective eye a dozen years ago .
The gatekeepers of the App Store have either been living in a cave since 1997 or are far more sensitive than the folks who approve the iTunes Store 's movie and TV offerings .
Apple is more than willing to sell you 12 seasons - worth of South Park episodes , as well as South Park : Bigger , Longer , and Uncut ( iTunes link ) , which could also be considered " potentially offensive " if you 're Canadian , a fan of either Saddam Hussein or God , or a Jewish mother .
Apple 's censorship is erratic , to say the least .
Apple banned a jocular jubblies jiggler named iBoobs , but allowed two apps that essentially endorse the same juvenalia , Wobble and iJiggles - and then asked the Wobblers to remove any references to " boobs " and " booty " from their marketing blurb .
Boobs and booty may be bad in Apple 's view , but it 's perfectly fine for the iTunes Store to offer an entire line of audiobooks by Susie Bright ( mildly NSFW ) in which she discusses such arresting topics as why some poor fellow can't get off when his wife gives him head .
And although the Wobblers can't use the word " boobs , " antediluvian comedienne Phyllis Diller is permitted to flog her book Men are Stupid ... And They Like Big Boobs ( iTunes link ) .
More serious is Apple 's less boobaphobic puritanism .
For example , last year it banned Infurious Comics ' Murderdrome in a clear case of nanny - vendor censorship - another clearly inconsistent censorship decision , seeing as how such slasher flicks as the full Saw oeuvre are all readily available .
From our point of view , Cartman is infinitely cuter than the Jigsaw Killer .
Perhaps the reason for Apple 's refusal to carry the South Park game is a simple case of economics .
According to BoingBoing , the South Park app would allow iPhone and iPod Touch users " the ability to stream clips " of the show .
And although South Park clips - even full episodes - are available from the South Park web site , perhaps Apple simply does n't want an iPhone - based clip player to supply content that it 's getting good money for at the iTunes Store . ®
Gorilla mom has no love for newborn at S.F. Zoo SAN FRANCISCO ZOO Keepers trying to stimulate maternal instinct in mother
A baby gorilla born at the San Francisco Zoo on Dec. 8 , 2008 was promptly abandoned by his mother .
Zookeepers are trying to get her to pay attention and raise the infant .

Keepers at the San Francisco Zoo placed a newborn gorilla in an incubator Tuesday after his mother continued to ignore the infant , zoo officials said .
The baby male , described as healthy and weighing 6 pounds , was removed from the gorilla house and put in the zoo hospital around 5 a.m. , about 17 hours after his mother , an endangered western lowland gorilla named Monifa , gave birth .
" He 's in excellent health , he 's moving around , grabbing things , sucking on his thumb and on our fingers , " said the zoo 's curator of primates , Corrine Macdonald .
Macdonald said keepers planned to briefly anesthetize and examine the mother , then place the baby on her chest and allow her to wake up .
" Hopefully , she will accept the infant then , " Macdonald said .
The baby was given an electrolyte fluid solution but no milk .
A newborn gorilla does not require milk for up to three days after birth , Macdonald said .
Late Tuesday , there was no word of whether the strategy was working .
Keepers remained behind closed doors inside the gorilla house .
If Monifa remains aloof , keepers will decide whether to raise the infant by hand or to see if another female gorilla can become a surrogate mother .
The gorilla birth was the first at the zoo in 10 years .
Keepers were initially ecstatic Monday because Monifa appeared to be caring for the infant .
But about two hours later , the mother left the nest to eat and did not return .
The baby 's father is the king of the gorilla house , Oscar Jonesy , who is on long - term loan from a zoo in Buffalo , N.Y .
Macdonald spent all Monday night and this morning inside the gorilla house , observing the drama before deciding to separate mother and baby .
Monifa obligingly went into another enclosure to allow keepers to remove her infant and take him to the hospital .
Giant Tidal Power Turbines Coming to a Canada Near You
January 24th , 2009 by Timothy B. Hurst
One of the world ’s leading developers of tidal power will partner with a Canadian utility to develop tidal power technology and associated facilities in Canada ’s Bay of Fundy , Nova Scotia .
Working in partnership with the Canadian company Minas Basin Pulp and Power , UK tidal power developers , Marine Current Turbines will demonstrate and deploy a 1.5MW tidal generator that will be connected to the Nova Scotia power grid .
Scott Travers , of Minas Basin Pulp and Power praised the move as an economic boon .
“ There is a potential new industry here employing hundreds of people in operations and manufacturing and deployment of tidal power technology , here and globally , ” said Travers in a statement .
The SeaGen turbines to be installed use similar principles found in wind generator technology .
The tidal turbines generate power from sea currents using a pair of axial flow turbines that drive generators through gearboxes .
However , the high density of seawater compared to wind allows a much smaller system .
The capture of kinetic energy from a water current , much like with wind energy or solar energy , depends on how many square meters of flow cross-section can be addressed by the system .
With water current turbines , the rotor swept area that dictates energy capture capability , because it is the cross section of flow that is intercepted which matters .
SeaGen has over 400 square meters of rotor area which is why it can develop its full rated power of 1.2MW in a flow of 2.4m / s ( 5 knots ) .
>> See an Animation of SeaGen turbines in action
Marine Current Turbines is emerging as a big player in the relatively nascent tidal power industry .
The company installed the world ’s first offshore tidal current device in 2003 .
And in 2008 , it installed and commissioned the 1.2MW SeaGen commercial prototype tidal current turbine in Strangford Narrows in Northern Ireland .
SeaGen generated at its full output of 1.2MW onto the local grid in December 2008 , becoming the most powerful tidal power turbine in the world .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
I begin with a video .
It is the most persuasive low - cost , home - brew video that I can remember .
If you do nothing else today , watch this video .
I wish I had produced it .
Conceptually , it is a stroke of genius .
It sets forth the current banking crisis admirably .
The remainder of my report rests on this video .
If you watched it , you now know the nature of the problem , as well as its magnitude .
To say that we are in uncharted waters does not begin to get across the idea of the magnitude of our current situation .
America is in a canoe , floating down a river that has never been explored .
Most of the passengers are trying to listen to the tour guide .
But there is a noise that interferes .
It is the sound of a waterfall ahead .
The noise is getting louder .
The tour guide is new .
It is a new career for him .
His first day on the job : January 20 .
He is a good talker , although it ’s clear that he is improvising .
The guys with the paddles are also new on the job .
This is their first trip down this particular river .
You and I are along for the ride .
We were assured that this would be a scenic trip , back when the excursion company , Ben Bernanke ’s Slow Boat to China , sold us tickets .
So far , we have gone through two sets of rapids : the first in August 2007 , which seemed to end by September , and the other beginning a year later , in August 2008 .
Since then , the rapids have gotten wilder , and the canoe more obviously not under control by the first crew with the paddles , who left on January 20 and handed the paddles over to the new crew .
The canoe seems out of control .
Each set of rapids is worse than the last .
We get through one set .
The other crew kept telling us that everything was under control after the first set .
Then we hit the second set .
They abandoned ship , assuming you would call this canoe a ship .
The crew has handed out life jackets , but has told us that we do n’t have to put them on yet .
But they have put on theirs .
The excursion company ’s owner , Dr. Bernanke , has said almost nothing since August 2007 .
His assistant , Hank “ Bailout ” Paulson , has bailed out .
His replacement , Tim “ Turbo ” Geithner , has just been handed a paddle .
Because he was paid $ 398,000 last year as captain of a cruise ship , the S.S. FOIA - Proof , no one is sure why he signed up for this low - paying assignment .
TWO MAPS
Turbo Bill will have to decide which branch of the river to follow .
He has a map .
It lists three branches .
Two of them mention the possibility of falls .
There is some hope that the third route will avoid the falls .
The first set of falls is marked Inflationary Falls .
The second set is marked Deflationary Falls .
There is a hoped - for third branch of this river : Conventional Creek .
Dr. Bernanke has bet his future — and ours — on this one .
Sadly for us , the map is torn at this point .
It is a matter of guesswork as to where this creek connects with the main branch of the river .
The video presents the graphic reality of Dr. Bernanke ’s strategy to negotiate the rapids .
The increase in the Federal Reserve System ’s lending to American ( and some foreign ) banks in 2008 , as of November , was a staggering $ 700 billion .
This increase in lending to banks was accomplished by an increase in the Federal Reserve ’s adjusted monetary base from $ 850 billion ( 2007 ) to $ 1.8 trillion .
See the graph here .
Here is our problem — as well as Dr. Bernanke’s .
This increase in the monetary base was produced by fiat money : the money spent by the FED to purchase assets .
The money was spent into circulation , as all increases in the FED ’s balance sheet are .
This money has entered the banking system .
There are two things the banks can do with this money : ( 1 ) keep some or all of it on deposit with the FED , where the public cannot get its hands on it ; ( 2 ) purchase investment assets from the public , which means that the fractional reserve banking process will take over and turn the monetary base into spendable money .
If the banks do the second , the money supply will more than double .
Prices will then more than double .
We will go over Inflation Falls .
If the banks keep the money on deposit at the FED , because the FED started paying interest on deposits last October — three years earlier than previous legislation had authorized — then the increase in excess reserves will have the same effect as would the doubling of the legal reserve requirement by the FED .
It will offset the increase in the monetary base .
Dr. Bernanke is betting his future and ours that this will get us onto Conventional Creek .
The intricate route through the rapids to Conventional Creek — assuming Conventional Creek actually exists — involves trusting commercial bankers not to do what bankers have always done : lend every dime the banks can get their hands on .
Banks make money by making loans .
There is no other way for banks to make a profit .
Always before — except possibly in 1929 — 33 — banks have lent every dime that was deposited .
To sit on unused reserves is to avoid getting paid .
Bankers enjoy getting paid .
They fear not getting paid .
So , Dr. Bernanke seems to be betting the canoe on bankers ’ doing what bankers never do : sit on reserves .
He is luring bankers to lend to the Federal Reserve , which does not face the wrath of shareholders or the FDIC .
It does not have to make a profit .
It gets to decide each year how much money to return to the Treasury as its donation .
It keeps enough to pay its bills .
To lure bank deposits into the FED ’s digital vault , the FED started paying interest last October .
But interest was low : 1.5 % until the second week of October , and 1 % thereafter .
This is the federal funds rate , the rate at which banks lend overnight to each other to meet reserve requirements .
This fall in the FedFunds rate has now created a problem for Dr. Bernanke ’s journey to Conventional Creek .
The FED has announced a target rate for FedFunds of 0 % .
In recent weeks , the rate has fallen to about one - tenth of 1 % .
I post this on my site in the department , “ Federal Reserve Charts . ”
The link is “ Free Market Federal Funds Rate . ”
Here was the FedFunds rate as of the week of January 19 — inauguration week .
You can see that it was close to one - tenth of 1 % .
Basically , this was no interest payment at all .
Here is the situation facing banks .
They can keep their money on deposit at the FED for free .
Or they can buy 90 - day Treasury bills , also for one - tenth of 1 % .
This is how they avoid all risk of default .
But they can not make a profit .
They can not avoid losses .
Meanwhile , anyone who receives digital money who decides to keep digital money has his money in a bank .
Banks must pay interest on most accounts .
For as long as depositors demand a rate of interest above 90 - day T - bills , banks have a major cash flow problem .
More money is going out the door in interest than is coming in from T - bills and reserves at the FED .
“ What ’s a banker to do ? ”
He can pay less to depositors .
That means depositors ’ hopes of ever retiring and living off of capital are doomed , unless they find a way to beat the stock market or the commodities market .
They must become entrepreneurs .
They do not want to do this .
It was not that they had any legitimate hope before .
They were paid ( maybe ) 3 % .
Price inflation was at 3 % .
They were taxed at ordinary rates on the interest payments .
They were going into the hole .
But the illusion of hope was still there .
If they are paid nothing on their deposits , they know they are doomed to working until age 85 , unless prices fall by 3 % a year — which would be a great thing .
It has not happened since 1932 .
Banks are paying depositors well above 0 % these days .

So , for every dollar that a bank keeps at the FED or in T - bills , it is losing money .
What is the incentive for banks to lose money ?
Only this : the terror of losing even more money .
TERRIFIED BANKERS
Ever since September 2008 , M - 1 has taken off like a skyrocket : Inflationary Falls .
In contrast , the M - 1 money multiplier has fallen like a stone : Deflationary Falls .
I post links to these charts in my department , “ Federal Reserve Charts . ”
You can see both charts on one page here .
My explanation for the M - 1 money multiplier ’s reversion to an M - 1 money divisor is that the FED began paying interest on bank reserves .
This has kept most of the increase in the adjusted monetary base from creating an inflationary disaster .
The bankers have now run out of profitable options .
They must accept one of these painful alternatives .
First , they accept the slow draining away of profits that will come as a result of the freeze on the interest rate income on their excess reserves — money they could legally lend .
Second , they accept the risk ( technically , uncertainty ) of lending to corporations in the middle of the longest recession since the end of World War II .
These corporations may go bankrupt .
Third , they can lend to the U.S. Treasury to buy long T - bonds , which pay above 3 % .
Their principal is then at risk .
Rising long rates , due to monetary inflation and then price inflation , could raise yields , thereby lowering the market value of the T - bonds .
If bankers keep their banks ’ money at the FED , this means that their terror is extreme .
They would rather suffer the slow losses of money paid to depositors .
A sure loss is better than the potential losses of lending to corporations or the U.S. Treasury .
This means that they think the canoe is going to go over Deflationary Falls .
If bankers are this pessimistic about the economy , then we really are in uncharted waters .
The people who Americans paid to manage their money misinvested hundreds of billions and — it may turn out — close to $ 4 trillion during Greenspan ’s bubble and the carry - over under Bernanke ’s attempted slowing of the monetary base , 2006 — 2007 .
These people were lured into a trap by Greenspan ’s monetary and interest rate policies .
Those Austrian School economists and forecasters who warned that this would happen were ignored then and are ignored now .
“ Crackpots .
Lucky guessers . ”
Now these same people , in shell shock because of what the market has done to their investments , are paralyzed in fear .
We are now being told by the so - called experts who told us not to sell our stocks , let alone sell short ( I recommended both in November 2007 ) , that the stock market is close to the bottom .
Yet they cannot tell us when this economy will recover .
Then how do they know the stock market is at the bottom ?
We are told , “ The market has discounted all the bad news to come . ”
Did the market forecast this in October 2007 ?
No .
So , why are the ex-genius stock fund managers any better informed now than then ?
If the banks will not shift those excess reserves to T - bonds or corporate bonds or corporate loans , then there is not going to be a recovery for years .
Banks are still failing .
Corporations are still failing .
The FED is still pumping in fiat money to re-capitalize banks .
Before long , it will be doing the same with T - bonds , for the Federal government ’s expected deficit is $ 1.2 trillion .
If bankers think , “ This economy is too risky to lend any money , ” then this economy will continue to decline .
Will we get mass deflation ?
No .
Mass deflation is a theory suggested by Keynesians .
They call this a zero - bound economy .
This is what Bernanke has worried about all along .
In his now infamous “ helicopter ” speech in 2002 , he said this .
However , a deflationary recession may differ in one respect from “ normal ” recessions in which the inflation rate is at least modestly positive : Deflation of sufficient magnitude may result in the nominal interest rate declining to zero or very close to zero .
Once the nominal interest rate is at zero , no further downward adjustment in the rate can occur , since lenders generally will not accept a negative nominal interest rate when it is possible instead to hold cash .
At this point , the nominal interest rate is said to have hit the “ zero bound . ”
We are now at this point .
The consumer price index actually fell in December .
The Median CPI was flat .
Deflation great enough to bring the nominal interest rate close to zero poses special problems for the economy and for policy .
First , when the nominal interest rate has been reduced to zero , the real interest rate paid by borrowers equals the expected rate of deflation , however large that may be .
. . .
Although deflation and the zero bound on nominal interest rates create a significant problem for those seeking to borrow , they impose an even greater burden on households and firms that had accumulated substantial debt before the onset of the deflation .
This burden arises because , even if debtors are able to refinance their existing obligations at low nominal interest rates , with prices falling they must still repay the principal in dollars of increasing ( perhaps rapidly increasing ) real value .
This is bad for consumers , he said .
What can be done about this ?
In short , “ What ’s a central banker to do ? ”
This :
Beyond its adverse effects in financial markets and on borrowers , the zero bound on the nominal interest rate raises another concern — the limitation that it places on conventional monetary policy .
Under normal conditions , the Fed and most other central banks implement policy by setting a target for a short - term interest rate — the overnight federal funds rate in the United States — and enforcing that target by buying and selling securities in open capital markets .
When the short - term interest rate hits zero , the central bank can no longer ease policy by lowering its usual interest - rate target .
We are now at that place that Bernanke feared was theoretically possible .
It has happened on his watch .
Some people still believe that the central bank , in his words then , has “ run out of ammunition . ”
He assured us that a central bank never runs out of ammunition .
However , a principal message of my talk today is that a central bank whose accustomed policy rate has been forced down to zero has most definitely not run out of ammunition .
As I will discuss , a central bank , either alone or in cooperation with other parts of the government , retains considerable power to expand aggregate demand and economic activity even when its accustomed policy rate is at zero .
What the video on FED lending showed is Bernanke ’s desperate attempt not to run out of ammunition .
Unless this ammunition is nothing but blanks , he will hit his target : the economy .
It is best to avoid a zero - bound condition , he said .
As with all Keynesians , all Chicago School monetarists , and all supply - side economists , Bernanke hates the thought of price deflation .
As I have already emphasized , deflation is generally the result of low and falling aggregate demand .
The basic prescription for preventing deflation is therefore straightforward , at least in principle :
Use monetary and fiscal policy as needed to support aggregate spending , in a manner as nearly consistent as possible with full utilization of economic resources and low and stable inflation .
In other words , the best way to get out of trouble is not to get into it in the first place .
Tough luck , Ben .
We are there .
Within the hard - money camp , most of us think mass inflation will be the result if present policies are followed by the FED .
The banks will eventually have to buy T - bonds and other interest - paying assets .
If they do n’t , the red ink of payments to depositors will bankrupt them .
They are like wounded men on a battlefield .
They will bleed to death .
The FDIC will intervene , or the FED will , before this happens .
American banking is now nationalized .
Congress is in a position to force banks to lend .
“ No loans , no more bailout money . ”
Before we go over Deflation Falls , Congress will do just that .
There are deflationists in the hard - money camp .
They are in fact the true hard - money people .
They think the dollar is true hard money .
They think prices will fall .
They trust the dollar , not gold .
The ones who trust gold and the dollar are not deflationists .
They are confused .
They think we will go over Deflation Falls .
I do n’t mean that they predict a Japan - like economy .
Japan had a few years in the 1990 ’s in which price deflation of 1 % occurred .
A rate of deflation that low is subject to statistical error .
No one really knows what “ prices in general ” — there are no known prices in general , only statistical indexes — did or did not do , when we are talking about a change of 1 % .
I am talking about someone who thinks the 1930 ’s are coming back .
Bernanke described this scenario : “ massive financial problems , including defaults , bankruptcies , and bank failures , were endemic in America ’s worst encounter with deflation , in the years 1930 - 33 — a period in which ( as I mentioned ) the U.S. price level fell about 10 percent per year . ”
I make the following prediction : this is not going to happen .
CONVENTIONAL CREEK
What about muddling through ?
What about a reversal of the zero - bound economy , but without mass price deflation ?
What about a reversal of FED policy , once the economy reverses ?
First , why should it reverse ?
Second , how soon ?
Third , what can the FED do to reverse its policy ?
Can it unload the toxic waste assets it swapped for Treasury debt ?
On whom ?
At what discounted price ?
Forget about it .
The FED is stuck forever with this junk .
Can the FED stop buying T - bonds and T - bills ?
With a $ 1.2 trillion deficit forecast this year ?
President Obama has said this will not be the last such year .
If the FED stops buying , rates will climb .
If rates climb , the recession reappears .
No exit there .
More monetary base increases .
Fourth , the FED can hike the reserve requirement for banks .
Convert today ’s excess reserves into legal reserves .
This is exactly what it should do : move toward 100 % reserve banking .
But then the banks will bleed again : more payments to depositors than income from lending .
They cannot lend because the reserve rate is at 20 % , or whatever the FED decides .
The FDIC then gets stuck with more busted banks .
It is below $ 25 billion in reserves now , and that is in Treasury debt .
It must sell Treasury debt in order to raise cash to cover deposits .
No exit .
CONCLUSION
I am all for muddling through .
But , at this point , I do n’t see Conventional Creek on my copy of the map .
The monetary base has been doubled .
The only thing keeping banks from lending to the limit of their legal reserves is fear .
If bankers are so afraid to lend , despite returns of one - tenth of 1 % , we are not heading toward Conventional Creek .
We are headed for the falls .
Inflation Falls .
Dollar falls .
Gold rises .

Right know I ’m writing the chapter of the book related to the weakest point in your preparedness plan regarding security .
Lets say you train with firearms , I ’ve convinced you of carrying even when you go to the toilet , you trained in H2H fighting and spar regularly .
If your gun has a critical failure of some kind that ca n’t be solved then to bad for Mr. Bad Guy because you ’re going to get rid of him with edged weapons , an umbrella , or your hands .
All very painful .
Now that I got you to feel all macho and such , what about your wife ?
How good is she in a fight ?
How about your kids ?
I have no grandeur delusions about myself .
Still I know I can take care of myself fairly well .
But my wife is like a slightly zoomed Barbie , she ’s very petite .
My son is just 6 years old , and my other boy is 4 months old .
Strategically speaking , it ’s a nightmare .
We were talking with my wife the other day , and she told me that she knew perfectly well how vulnerable she would be if someone just tried to pull our baby away from her .
Babies get stolen here just like anywhere else .
A bit worse given that corruption makes it easier for them to disappear and then reappear as legally adopted babies .
Not long ago my wife was mugged by a bunch of kids with a gun ( including little girls ) , less than 10 years old .
The mugger ’s target priority goes something like : 1) Old folks2 ) Women3 ) Kids4 )
Weak / timid looking menWhat can you do ?
For starters , get everyone onboard .
A silly wife / husband that thinks there ’s nothing to worry about even when crime becomes painfully evident is just a disaster waiting to happen .
That kind of folk get hit , and they get hit hard .
I ’ve lost count of how many times the woman next door got robbed in her home .
She pays the price for being so sloppy regarding personal security .
Once you get your family to take this issue seriously , you have to set some security standards .
1 ) Not chit chatting on the front door .
Better to go inside for a cup of tea and talk all you want , safely .
2 ) Doors and windows closed .
Even when you must ventilate the house , open only windows that have bars , or second story windows that are hard to reach .
3 ) No one in the family , no one , opens the door without the authorization of an adult .
My kid used to rush to the door and look through a window near by .
We ’ve talked about that so he does n’t do it any more .
4 ) The adult will NOT open the door unless it ’s someone he knows well or is a person he / she is expecting .
Unauthorized power company people or cops will have to wait outside until you can make a phone call and check that they are ok .
The fake cop / power / phone / gas company guy is still a common way to get in .
Mostly very old people fall for this trick these days .
Regarding walking around and such , there ’s little you and your family can do about this .
As I always say , you do n’t get to bug out to the hills , you have to go on with your life .
But you CAN set some parameters .1 ) Not going out when its dark .
2 ) Get your wife to carry a firearm .
If not possible then OC spray .
3 ) Always keep your eyes opened and check your 6 ( back ) 4 )
If in doubt , better to play it safe .
My wife will hurry and walk into a store if she feels someone is getting too close or is acting suspiciously .
In one occasion when a gunfight started , my wife rushed into a store and went all the way to the back behind several walls ( we have mostly interior brick and mortar walls here )
She told me “ I was n’t going to stay there in the front of the shop .
I could have gotten shot through the glass ” Good girl .
:) 5 ) Avoid places where there ’s little public , specially deserted streets .
It ’s no guarantee , but many robbers prefer to operate where there ’s little people .
About your kids .
It ’s hard when they are so little .
I tell my six year old to fight if a stranger grabs him .
I tell him to fight , punch and scream like there ’s no tomorrow “ Help !
He ’s not my dad / mom Help , he ’s a pervert , Help ” People usually do n’t get involved , but kids have a greater chance of receiving help , specially if the bystanders think the guy is a pervert .
A robber may just take your wallet and that ’s that .
A guy taking your kid… you do n’t want to know what ’s more likely to happen .
It ’s not good .
Either he ’s getting kidnapped by child molesters , degenerates , to sell him / her for child prostitution , there ’s even been kids that later where found without some of their organs . ( sold for transplants )
Best case scenario they just want a ransom .
But then again they might kill him none the less , and you do n’t want chubby fingers being sent toyou by mail , like in the Ariel Strajman kidnap .
Just a few pointers guys , take care .

You Can Call Long Distance for
Less Than You Think
" You see , a few years ago the phone company made one big mistake , " Gilbertson explains two days later in his apartment .
" They were careless enough to let some technical journal publish the actual frequencies used to create all their multi- frequency tones .
Just a theoretical article some Bell Telephone Laboratories engineer was doing about switching theory , and he listed the tones in passing .
At ----- [ a well - known technical school ]
I had been fooling around with phones for several years before I came across a copy of the journal in the engineering library .
I ran back to the lab and it took maybe twelve hours from the time I saw that article to put together the first working blue box .
It was bigger and clumsier than this little baby , but it worked . "
It 's all there on public record in that technical journal written mainly by Bell Lab people for other telephone engineers .
Or at least it was public .
" Just try and get a copy of that issue at some engineering - school library now .
Bell has had them all red-tagged and withdrawn from circulation , " Gilbertson tells me .
" But it 's too late .
It 's all public now .
And once they became public the technology needed to create your own beeper device is within the range of any twelve - year - old kid , any twelve - year - old blind kid as a matter of fact .
And he can do it in less than the twelve hours it took us .
Blind kids do it all the time .
They can't build anything as precise and compact as my beeper box , but theirs can do anything mine can do . "
" How ? "
" Okay .
About twenty years ago A.T.&T. made a multi-billion - dollar decision to operate its entire long - distance switching system on twelve electronically generated combinations of six master tones .
Those are the tones you sometimes hear in the background after you 've dialed a long - distance number .
They decided to use some very simple tones  the tone for each number is just two fixed single - frequency tones played simultaneously to create a certain beat frequency .
Like 1300 cycles per second and 900 cycles per second played together give you the tone for digit 5 .
Now , what some of these phone phreaks have done is get themselves access to an electric organ .
Any cheap family home - entertainment organ .
Since the frequencies are public knowledge now  one blind phone phreak has even had them recorded in one of those talking books for the blind  they just have to find the musical notes on the organ which correspond to the phone tones .
Then they tape them .
For instance , to get Ma Bell 's tone for the number 1 , you press down organ keys F5 and A5 [ 900 and 700 cycles per second ] at the same time .
To produce the tone for 2 it's F5 and C6 [ 1100 and 700 c.p.s ] .
The phone phreaks circulate the whole list of notes so there 's no trial and error anymore . "
He shows me a list of the rest of the phone numbers and the two electric organ keys that produce them .
" Actually , you have to record these notes at 3 ¾ inches - per - second tape speed and double it to 7 ½ inches - per - second when you play them back , to get the proper tones , " he adds .
" So once you have all the tones recorded , how do you plug them into the phone system ? "
" Well , they take their organ and their cassette recorder , and start banging out entire phone numbers in tones on the organ , including country codes , routing instructions , ' KP ' and ' Start ' tones .
Or , if they do n't have an organ , someone in the phone - phreak network sends them a cassette with all the tones recorded , with a voice saying ' Number one , ' then you have the tone , ' Number two , ' then the tone and so on .
So with two cassette recorders they can put together a series of phone numbers by switching back and forth from number to number .
Any idiot in the country with a cheap cassette recorder can make all the free calls he wants . "
" You mean you just hold the cassette recorder up the mouthpiece and switch in a series of beeps you 've recorded ?
The phone thinks that anything that makes these tones must be its own equipment ? "
" Right .
As long as you get the frequency within thirty cycles per second of the phone company 's tones , the phone equipment thinks it hears its own voice talking to it .
The original granddaddy phone phreak was this blind kid with perfect pitch , Joe Engressia , who used to whistle into the phone .
An operator could tell the difference between his whistle and the phone company 's electronic tone generator , but the phone company 's switching circuit can't tell them apart .
The bigger the phone company gets and the further away from human operators it gets , the more vulnerable it becomes to all sorts of phone phreaking . "
A Guide for the Perplexed
" But wait a minute , " I stop Gilbertson .
" If everything you do sounds like phone - company equipment , why does n't the phone company charge you for the call the way it charges its own equipment ? "
" Okay .
That 's where the 2600 - cycle tone comes in .
I better start from the beginning . "
The beginning he describes for me is a vision of the phone system of the continent as thousands of webs , of long - line trunks radiating from each of the hundreds of toll switching offices to the other toll switching offices .
Each toll switching office is a hive compacted of thousands of long - distance tandems constantly whistling and beeping to tandems in far - off toll switching offices .
The tandem is the key to the whole system .
Each tandem is a line with some relays with the capability of signaling any other tandem in any other toll switching office on the continent , either directly one - to - one or by programming a roundabout route through several other tandems if all the direct routes are busy .
For instance , if you want to call from New York to Los Angeles and traffic is heavy on all direct trunks between the two cities , your tandem in New York is programmed to try the next best route , which may send you down to a tandem in New Orleans , then up to San Francisco , or down to a New Orleans tandem , back to an Atlanta tandem , over to an Albuquerque tandem and finally up to Los Angeles .
When a tandem is not being used , when it 's sitting there waiting for someone to make a long - distance call , it whistles .
One side of the tandem , the side " facing " your home phone , whistles at 2600 cycles per second toward all the home phones serviced by the exchange , telling them it is at their service , should they be interested in making a long - distance call .
The other side of the tandem is whistling 2600 c.p.s. into one or more long - distance trunk lines , telling the rest of the phone system that it is neither sending nor receiving a call through that trunk at the moment , that it has no use for that trunk at the moment .
" When you dial a long - distance number the first thing that happens is that you are hooked into a tandem .
A register comes up to the side of the tandem facing away from you and presents that side with the number you dialed .
This sending side of the tandem stops whistling 2600 into its trunk line .
When a tandem stops the 2600 tone it has been sending through a trunk , the trunk is said to be " seized , " and is now ready to carry the number you have dialed  converted into multi- frequency beep tones  to a tandem in the area code and central office you want .
Now when a blue - box operator wants to make a call from New Orleans to New York he starts by dialing the 800 number of a company which might happen to have its headquarters in Los Angeles .
The sending side of the New Orleans tandem stops sending 2600 out over the trunk to the central office in Los Angeles , thereby seizing the trunk .
Your New Orleans tandem begins sending beep tones to a tandem it has discovered idly whistling 2600 cycles in Los Angeles .
The receiving end of that L.A. tandem is seized , stops whistling 2600 , listens to the beep tones which tell it which L.A. phone to ring , and starts ringing the 800 number .
Meanwhile a mark made in the New Orleans office accounting tape notes that a call from your New Orleans phone to the 800 number in L.A. has been initiated and gives the call a code number .
Everything is routine so far .
But then the phone phreak presses his blue box to the mouthpiece and pushes the 2600 - cycle button , sending 2600 out from the New Orleans tandem to the L.A. tandem .
The L.A. tandem notices 2600 cycles are coming over the line again and assumes that New Orleans has hung up because the trunk is whistling as if idle .
The L.A. tandem immediately ceases ringing the L.A. 800 number .
But as soon as the phreak takes his finger off the 2600 button , the L.A. tandem assumes the trunk is once again being used because the 2600 is gone , so it listens for a new series of digit tones  to find out where it must send the call .
Thus the blue - box operator in New Orleans now is in touch with a tandem in L.A. which is waiting like an obedient genie to be told what to do next .
The blue - box owner then beeps out the ten digits of the New York number which tell the L.A. tandem to relay a call to New York City .
Which it promptly does .
As soon as your party picks up the phone in New York , the side of the New Orleans tandem facing you stops sending 2600 cycles to you and stars carrying his voice to you by way of the L.A. tandem .
A notation is made on the accounting tape that the connection has been made on the 800 call which had been initiated and noted earlier .
When you stop talking to New York a notation is made that the 800 call has ended .
At three the next morning , when the phone company 's accounting computer starts reading back over the master accounting tape for the past day , it records that a call of a certain length of time was made from your New Orleans home to an L.A. 800 number and , of course , the accounting computer has been trained to ignore those toll - free 800 calls when compiling your monthly bill .
" All they can prove is that you made an 800 toll - free call , " Gilbertson the inventor concludes .
" Of course , if you 're foolish enough to talk for two hours on an 800 call , and they 've installed one of their special anti-fraud computer programs to watch out for such things , they may spot you and ask why you took two hours talking to Army Recruiting 's 800 number when you 're 4 - F .
But if you do it from a pay phone , they may discover something peculiar the next day  if they 've got a blue - box hunting program in their computer  but you 'll be a long time gone from the pay phone by then .
Using a pay phone is almost guaranteed safe . "
" What about the recent series of blue - box arrests all across the country  New York , Cleveland , and so on ? " I asked .
" How were they caught so easily ? "
" From what I can tell , they made one big mistake : they were seizing trunks using an area code plus 555 - 1212 instead of an 800 number .
Using 555 is easy to detect because when you send multi- frequency beep tones of 555 you get a charge for it on your tape and the accounting computer knows there 's something wrong when it tries to bill you for a two - hour call to Akron , Ohio , information , and it drops a trouble card which goes right into the hands of the security agent if they 're looking for blue - box users .
" Whoever sold those guys their blue boxes did n't tell them how to use them properly , which is fairly irresponsible .
And they were fairly stupid to use them at home all the time .
" But what those arrests really mean is that an awful lot of blue boxes are flooding into the country and that people are finding them so easy to make that they know how to make them before they know how to use them .
Ma Bell is in trouble . "
And if a blue - box operator or a cassette - recorder phone phreak sticks to pay phones and 800 numbers , the phone company can't stop them ?
" Not unless they change their entire nationwide long - lines technology , which will take them a few billion dollars and twenty years .
Right now they can't do a thing .
They 're screwed . "
Captain Crunch Demonstrates
His Famous Unit
There is an underground telephone network in this country .
Gilbertson discovered it the very day news of his activities hit the papers .
That evening his phone began ringing .
Phone phreaks from Seattle , from Florida , from New York , from San Jose , and from Los Angeles began calling him and telling him about the phone - phreak network .
He'd get a call from a phone phreak who'd say nothing but , " Hang up and call this number . "
When he dialed the number he'd find himself tied into a conference of a dozen phone phreaks arranged through a quirky switching station in British Columbia .
They identified themselves as phone phreaks , they demonstrated their homemade blue boxes which they called " M - F- ers " ( for " multi- frequency , " among other things ) for him , they talked shop about phone - phreak devices .
They let him in on their secrets on the theory that if the phone company was after him he must be trustworthy .
And , Gilbertson recalls , they stunned him with their technical sophistication .
I ask him how to get in touch with the phone - phreak network .
He digs around through a file of old schematics and comes up with about a dozen numbers in three widely separated area codes .
" Those are the centers , " he tells me .
Alongside some of the numbers he writes in first names or nicknames : names like Captain Crunch , Dr. No , Frank Carson ( also a code word for a free call ) , Marty Freeman ( code word for M - F device ) , Peter Perpendicular Pimple , Alefnull , and The Cheshire Cat .
He makes checks alongside the names of those among these top twelve who are blind .
There are five checks .
I ask him who this Captain Crunch person is .
" Oh . The Captain .
He 's probably the most legendary phone phreak .
He calls himself Captain Crunch after the notorious Cap'n Crunch 2600 whistle . "
( Several years ago , Gilbertson explains , the makers of Cap'n Crunch breakfast cereal offered a toy - whistle prize in every box as a treat for the Cap'n Crunch set .
Somehow a phone phreak discovered that the toy whistle just happened to produce a perfect 2600 - cycle tone .
When the man who calls himself Captain Crunch was transferred overseas to England with his Air Force unit , he would receive scores of calls from his friends and " mute " them  make them free of charge to them  by blowing his Cap'n Crunch whistle into his end . )
" Captain Crunch is one of the older phone phreaks , " Gilbertson tells me .
" He 's an engineer who once got in a little trouble for fooling around with the phone , but he can't stop .
Well , this guy drives across country in a Volkswagen van with an entire switchboard and a computerized super - sophisticated M - F - er in the back .
He 'll pull up to a phone booth on a lonely highway somewhere , snake a cable out of his bus , hook it onto the phone and sit for hours , days sometimes , sending calls zipping back and forth across the country , all over the world .... "
Back at my motel , I dialed the number he gave me for " Captain Crunch " and asked for G---- T----- , his real name , or at least the name he uses when he's not dashing into a phone booth beeping out M- F tones faster than a speeding bullet , and zipping phantomlike through the phone company 's long - distance lines .
When G---- T----- answered the phone and I told him I was preparing a story for Esquire about phone phreaks , he became very indignant .
" I do n't do that .
I do n't do that anymore at all .
And if I do it , I do it for one reason and one reason only .
I 'm learning about a system .
The phone company is a System .
A computer is a System .
Do you understand ?
If I do what I do , it is only to explore a System .
Computers .
Systems .
That 's my bag .
The phone company is nothing but a computer . "
A tone of tightly restrained excitement enters the Captain 's voice when he starts talking about Systems .
He begins to pronounce each syllable with the hushed deliberation of an obscene caller .
" Ma Bell is a system I want to explore .
It 's a beautiful system , you know , but Ma Bell screwed up .
It 's terrible because Ma Bell is such a beautiful system , but she screwed up .
I learned how she screwed up from a couple of blind kids who wanted me to build a device .
A certain device .
They said it could make free calls .
I was n't interested in free calls .
But when these blind kids told me I could make calls into a computer , my eyes lit up .
I wanted to learn about computers .
I wanted to learn about Ma Bell 's computers .
So I built the little device .
Only I built it wrong and Ma Bell found out .
Ma Bell can detect things like that .
Ma Bell knows .
So I 'm strictly out of it now .
I do n't do it .
Except for learning purposes . "
He pauses .
" So you want to write an article .
Are you paying for this call ?
Hang up and call this number . "
He gives me a number in an area code a thousand miles north of his own .
I dial the number .
" Hello again .
This is Captain Crunch .
You are speaking to me on a toll - free loop - around in Portland , Oregon .
Do you know what a toll - free loop around is ?
I 'll tell you . "
He explains to me that almost every exchange in the country has open test numbers which allow other exchanges to test their connections with it .
Most of these numbers occur in consecutive pairs , such as 302 956-0041 and 956-0042 .
Well , certain phone phreaks discovered that if two people from anywhere in the country dial those two consecutive numbers they can talk together just as if one had called the other 's number , with no charge to either of them , of course .
" Your voice is looping around in a 4A switching machine up there in Canada , zipping back down to me , " the Captain tells me .
" My voice is looping around up there and back down to you .
And it can't ever cost anyone money .
The phone phreaks and I have compiled a list of many many of these numbers .
You would be surprised if you saw the list .
I could show it to you .
But I wo n't .
I 'm out of that now .
I 'm not out to screw Ma Bell .
I know better .
If I do anything it's for the pure knowledge of the System .
You can learn to do fantastic things .
Have you ever heard eight tandems stacked up ?
Do you know the sound of tandems stacking and unstacking ?
Give me your phone number .
Okay .
Hang up now and wait a minute . "
Slightly less than a minute later the phone rang and the Captain was on the line , his voice sounding far more excited , almost aroused .
" I wanted to show you what it 's like to stack up tandems .
To stack up tandems . "
( Whenever the Captain says " stack up " it sounds as if he is licking his lips . )
" How do you like the connection you 're on now ? " the Captain asks me .
" It 's a raw tandem .
A raw tandem .
Ain't nothin ' up to it but a tandem .
Now I 'm going to show you what it 's like to stack up .
Blow off .
Land in a far away place .
To stack that tandem up , whip back and forth across the country a few times , then shoot on up to Moscow .
" Listen , " Captain Crunch continues .
" Listen .
I 've got a line tie on my switchboard here , and I 'm gonna let you hear me stack and unstack tandems .
Listen to this .
It 's gonna blow your mind . "
First I hear a super rapid - fire pulsing of the flutelike phone tones , then a pause , then another popping burst of tones , then another , then another .
Each burst is followed by a beep - kachink sound .
" We have now stacked up four tandems , " said Captain Crunch , sounding somewhat remote .
" That 's four tandems stacked up .
Do you know what that means ?
That means I 'm whipping back and forth , back and forth twice , across the country , before coming to you .
I 've been known to stack up twenty tandems at a time .
Now , just like I said , I 'm going to shoot up to Moscow . "
There is a new , longer series of beeper pulses over the line , a brief silence , then a ring .
" Hello , " answers a far - off voice .
" Hello .
Is this the American Embassy Moscow ? "
" Yes , sir .
Who is this calling ? " says the voice .
" Yes .
This is test board here in New York .
We 're calling to check out the circuits , see what kind of lines you 've got .
Everything okay there in Moscow ? "
" Okay ? "
" Well , yes , how are things there ? "
" Oh .
Well , everything 's okay , I guess . "
" Okay .
Thank you . "
They hang up , leaving a confused series of beep - kachink sounds hanging in mid-ether in the wake of the call before dissolving away .
The Captain is pleased .
" You believe me now , do n't you ?
Do you know what I 'd like to do ?
I 'd like to call up your editor at Esquire and show him just what it sounds like to stack and unstack tandems .
I 'll give him a show that will blow his mind .
What 's his number ? "
I ask the Captain what kind of device he was using to accomplish all his feats .
The Captain is pleased at the question .
" You could tell it was special , could n't you ?
Ten pulses per second .
That 's faster than the phone company 's equipment .
Believe me , this unit is the most famous unit in the country .
There is no other unit like it .
Believe me . "
" Yes , I 've heard about it .
Some other phone phreaks have told me about it . "
" They have been referring to my , ahem , unit ?
What is it they said ?
Just out of curiosity , did they tell you it was a highly sophisticated computer - operated unit , with acoustical coupling for receiving outputs and a switch - board with multiple - line - tie capability ?
Did they tell you that the frequency tolerance is guaranteed to be not more than .05 percent ?
The amplitude tolerance less than .01 decibel ?
Those pulses you heard were perfect .
They just come faster than the phone company .
Those were high - precision op - amps .
Op-amps are instrumentation amplifiers designed for ultra-stable amplification , super - low distortion and accurate frequency response .
Did they tell you it can operate in temperatures from - 55 ºC to +125ºC ? "
I admit that they did not tell me all that .
" I built it myself , " the Captain goes on .
" If you were to go out and buy the components from an industrial wholesaler it would cost you at least $ 1,500 .
I once worked for a semiconductor company and all this did n't cost me a cent .
Do you know what I mean ?
Did they tell you about how I put a call completely around the world ?
I 'll tell you how I did it .
I M-F-ed Tokyo inward , who connected me to India , India connected me to Greece , Greece connected me to Pretoria , South Africa , South Africa connected me to South America , I went from South America to London , I had a London operator connect me to a New York operator , I had New York connect me to a California operator who rang the phone next to me .
Needless to say I had to shout to hear myself .
But the echo was far out .
Fantastic .
Delayed .
It was delayed twenty seconds , but I could hear myself talk to myself . "
" You mean you were speaking into the mouthpiece of one phone sending your voice around the world into your ear through a phone on the other side of your head ? "
I asked the Captain .
I had a vision of something vaguely autoerotic going on , in a complex electronic way .
" That 's right , " said the Captain .
" I 've also sent my voice around the world one way , going east on one phone , and going west on the other , going through cable one way , satellite the other , coming back together at the same time , ringing the two phones simultaneously and picking them up and whipping my voice both ways around the world back to me .
Wow .
That was a mind blower . "
" You mean you sit there with both phones on your ear and talk to yourself around the world , " I said incredulously .
" Yeah .
Um hum .
That 's what I do .
I connect the phones together and sit there and talk . "
" What do you say ?
What do you say to yourself when you 're connected ? "
" Oh , you know .
Hello test one two three , " he says in a low - pitched voice .
" Hello test one two three , " he replied to himself in a high - pitched voice .
" Hello test one two three , " he repeats again , low - pitched .
" Hello test one two three , " he replies , high - pitched .
" I sometimes do this : Hello hello hello hello , hello , hello , " he trails off and breaks into laughter .
Why Captain Crunch Hardly Ever
Taps Phones Anymore
Using internal phone - company codes , phone phreaks have learned a simple method for tapping phones .
Phone - company operators have in front of them a board that holds verification jacks .
It allows them to plug into conversations in case of emergency , to listen in to a line to determine if the line is busy or the circuits are busy .
Phone phreaks have learned to beep out the codes which lead them to a verification operator , tell the verification operator they are switchmen from some other area code testing out verification trunks .
Once the operator hooks them into the verification trunk , they disappear into the board for all practical purposes , slip unnoticed into any one of the 10,000 to 100,000 numbers in that central office without the verification operator knowing what they 're doing , and of course without the two parties to the connection knowing there is a phantom listener present on their line .
Toward the end of my hour - long first conversation with him , I asked the Captain if he ever tapped phones .
" Oh no .
I do n't do that .
I do n't think it 's right , " he told me firmly .
" I have the power to do it but I do n't ...
Well one time , just one time , I have to admit that I did .
There was this girl , Linda , and I wanted to find out ... you know .
I tried to call her up for a date .
I had a date with her the last weekend and I thought she liked me .
I called her up , man , and her line was busy , and I kept calling and it was still busy .
Well , I had just learned about this system of jumping into lines and I said to myself , ' Hmmm .
Why not just see if it works .
It 'll surprise her if all of a sudden I should pop up on her line .
It 'll impress her , if anything . '
So I went ahead and did it .
I M-F-ed into the line .
My M -F-er is powerful enough when patched directly into the mouthpiece to trigger a verification trunk without using an operator the way the other phone phreaks have to .
" I slipped into the line and there she was talking to another boyfriend .
Making sweet talk to him .
I did n't make a sound because I was so disgusted .
So I waited there for her to hang up , listening to her making sweet talk to the other guy .
You know .
So as soon as she hung up I instantly M - F - ed her up and all I said was , ' Linda , we 're through . '
And I hung up .
And it blew her head off .
She could n't figure out what the hell happened .
" But that was the only time .
I did it thinking I would surprise her , impress her .
Those were all my intentions were , and well , it really kind of hurt me pretty badly , and ... and ever since then I do n't go into verification trunks . "
Moments later my first conversation with the Captain comes to a close .
" Listen , " he says , his spirits somewhat cheered , " listen .
What you are going to hear when I hang up is the sound of tandems unstacking .
Layer after layer of tandems unstacking until there 's nothing left of the stack , until it melts away into nothing .
Cheep , cheep , cheep , cheep , " he concludes , his voice descending to a whisper with each cheep .
He hangs up .
The phone suddenly goes into four spasms : kachink cheep .
Kachink cheep kachink cheep kachink cheep , and the complex connection has wiped itself out like the Cheshire cat 's smile .
The MF Boogie Blues
The next number I choose from the select list of phone - phreak illuminati , prepared for me by the blue - box inventor is a Memphis number .
It is the number of Joe Engressia , the first and still perhaps the most accomplished blind phone phreak .
Three years ago Engressia was a nine - day wonder in newspapers and magazines all over America because he had been discovered whistling free long - distance connections for fellow students at the University of South Florida .
Engressia was born with perfect pitch ; he could whistle phone tones better than the phone - company 's equipment .
Engressia might have gone on whistling in the dark for a few friends for the rest of his life if the phone company had n't decided to expose him .
He was warned , disciplined by the college , and the whole case became public .
In the months following media reports of his talent , Engressia began receiving strange calls .
There were calls from a group of kids in Los Angeles who could do some very strange things with the quirky General Telephone and Electronics circuitry in L.A. suburbs .
There were calls from a group of mostly blind kids in ----, California , who had been doing some interesting experiments with Cap'n Crunch whistles and test loops .
There was a group in Seattle , a group in Cambridge , Massachusetts , a few from New York , a few scattered across the country .
Some of them had already equipped themselves with cassette and electronic M - F devices .
For some of these groups , it was the first time they knew of the others .
The exposure of Engressia was the catalyst that linked the separate phone - phreak centers together .
They all called Engressia .
They talked to him about what he was doing and what they were doing .
And then he told them  the scattered regional centers and lonely independent phone phreakers  about each other , gave them each other 's numbers to call , and within a year the scattered phone - phreak centers had grown into a nationwide underground .
Joe Engressia is only twenty - two years old now , but along the phone - phreak network he is " the old man , " accorded by phone phreaks something of the reverence the phone company bestows on Alexander Graham Bell .
He seldom needs to make calls anymore .
The phone phreaks all call him and let him know what new tricks , new codes , new techniques they have learned .
Every night he sits like a sightless spider in his little apartment receiving messages from every tendril of his web .
It is almost a point of pride with Joe that they call him .
But when I reached him in his Memphis apartment that night , Joe Engressia was lonely , jumpy and upset .
" God , I 'm glad somebody called .
I do n't know why tonight of all nights I do n't get any calls .
This guy around here got drunk again tonight and propositioned me again .
I keep telling him we 'll never see eye to eye on this subject , if you know what I mean .
I try to make light of it , you know , but he does n't get it .
I can hear him out there getting drunker and I do n't know what he 'll do next .
It 's just that I 'm really all alone here .
I just moved to Memphis , it 's the first time I 'm living out on my own , and I 'd hate for it to all collapse now .
But I wo n't go to bed with him .
I 'm just not very interested in sex and even if I can't see him I know he 's ugly .
" Did you hear that ?
That 's him banging a bottle against the wall outside .
He 's nice .
Well forget about it .
You 're doing a story on phone phreaks ?
Listen to this .
It 's the M F Boogie blues . "
Sure enough , a jumpy version of Muskrat Ramble boogies its way over the line , each note one of those long - distance phone tones .
The music stops .
A huge roaring voice blasts the phone off my ear : " AND THE QUESTION IS ... " roars the voice , " CAN A BLIND PERSON HOOK UP AN AMPLIFIER ON HIS OWN ? "
The roar ceases .
A high - pitched operator - type voice replaces it .
" This is Southern Braille Tel. & Tel .
Have tone , will phone . "
This is succeeded by a quick series of M - F tones , a swift " kachink " and a deep reassuring voice : " If you need home care , call the visiting - nurses association .
First National time in Honolulu is 4:32 p.m. "
Joe back in his Joe voice again : " Are we seeing eye to eye ?
' Sí , sí , ' said the blind Mexican .
Ahem .
Yes .
Would you like to know the weather in Tokyo ? "
This swift manic sequence of phone - phreak vaudeville stunts and blind - boy jokes manages to keep Joe 's mind off his tormentor only as long as it lasts .
" The reason I 'm in Memphis , the reason I have to depend on that homosexual guy , is that this is the first time I 've been able to live on my own and make phone trips on my own .
I 've been banned from all central offices around home in Florida , they knew me too well , and at the University some of my fellow scholars were always harassing me because I was on the dorm pay phone all the time and making fun of me because of my fat ass , which of course I do have , it 's my physical fatness program , but I do n't like to hear it every day , and if I can't phone trip and I can't phone phreak , I can't imagine what I 'd do , I 've been devoting three quarters of my life to it .
" I moved to Memphis because I wanted to be on my own as well as because it has a Number 5 crossbar switching system and some interesting little independent phone - company districts nearby and so far they do n't seem to know who I am so I can go on phone tripping , and for me phone tripping is just as important as phone phreaking . "
Phone tripping , Joe explains , begins with calling up a central - office switch room .
He tells the switchman in a polite earnest voice that he's a blind college student interested in telephones , and could he perhaps have a guided tour of the switching station ?
Each step of the tour Joe likes to touch and feel relays , caress switching circuits , switchboards , crossbar arrangements .
So when Joe Engressia phone phreaks he feels his way through the circuitry of the country garden of forking paths , he feels switches shift , relays shunt , crossbars swivel , tandems engage and disengage even as he hears  with perfect pitch  his M- F pulses make the entire Bell system dance to his tune .
Just one month ago Joe took all his savings out of his bank and left home , over the emotional protests of his mother .
" I ran away from home almost , " he likes to say .
Joe found a small apartment house on Union Avenue and began making phone trips .
He 'd take a bus a hundred miles south into Mississippi to see some old - fashioned Bell equipment still in use in several states , which had been puzzling .
He 'd take a bus three hundred miles to Charlotte , North Carolina , to look at some brand - new experimental equipment .
He hired a taxi to drive him twelve miles to a suburb to tour the office of a small phone company with some interesting idiosyncrasies in its routing system .
He was having the time of his life , he said , the most freedom and pleasure he had known .
In that month he had done very little long - distance phone phreaking from his own phone .
He had begun to apply for a job with the phone company , he told me , and he wanted to stay away from anything illegal .
" Any kind of job will do , anything as menial as the most lowly operator .
That 's probably all they 'd give me because I 'm blind .
Even though I probably knew more than most switchmen .
But that 's okay .
I want to work for Ma Bell .
I do n't hate Ma Bell the way Gilbertson and some phone phreaks do .
I do n't want to screw Ma Bell .
With me it's the pleasure of pure knowledge .
There 's something beautiful about the system when you know it intimately the way I do .
But I do n't know how much they know about me here .
I have a very intuitive feel for the condition of the line I 'm on , and I think they 're monitoring me off and on lately , but I have n't been doing much illegal .
I have to make a few calls to switchmen once in a while which are n't strictly legal , and once I took an acid trip and was having these auditory hallucinations as if I were trapped and these planes were dive - bombing me , and all of sudden I had to phone phreak out of there .
For some reason I had to call Kansas City , but that 's all . "
A Warning Is Delivered
At this point  one o'clock in my time zone  a loud knock on my motel - room door interrupts our conversation .
Outside the door I find a uniformed security guard who informs me that there has been an " emergency phone call " for me while I have been on the line and that the front desk has sent him up to let me know .
Two seconds after I say good - bye to Joe and hang up , the phone rings .
" Who were you talking to ? " the agitated voice demands .
The voice belongs to Captain Crunch .
" I called because I decided to warn you of something .
I decided to warn you to be careful .
I do n't want this information you get to get to the radical underground .
I do n't want it to get into the wrong hands .
What would you say if I told you it 's possible for three phone phreaks to saturate the phone system of the nation .
Saturate it .
Busy it out .
All of it .
I know how to do this .
I 'm not gonna tell .
A friend of mine has already saturated the trunks between Seattle and New York .
He did it with a computerized M - F - er hitched into a special Manitoba exchange .
But there are other , easier ways to do it . "
Just three people ?
I ask .
How is that possible ?
" Have you ever heard of the long - lines guard frequency ?
Do you know about stacking tandems with 17 and 2600 ?
Well , I 'd advise you to find out about it .
I 'm not gonna tell you .
But whatever you do , do n't let this get into the hands of the radical underground . "
( Later Gilbertson the inventor confessed that while he had always been skeptical about the Captain 's claim of the sabotage potential of trunk - tying phone phreaks , he had recently heard certain demonstrations which convinced him the Captain was not speaking idly .
" I think it might take more than three people , depending on how many machines like Captain Crunch 's were available .
But even though the Captain sounds a little weird , he generally turns out to know what he 's talking about . " )
" You know , " Captain Crunch continues in his admonitory tone , " you know the younger phone phreaks call Moscow all the time .
Suppose everybody were to call Moscow .
I 'm no right - winger .
But I value my life .
I do n't want the Commies coming over and dropping a bomb on my head .
That 's why I say you 've got to be careful about who gets this information . "
The Captain suddenly shifts into a diatribe against those phone phreaks who do n't like the phone company .
" They do n't understand , but Ma Bell knows everything they do .
Ma Bell knows .
Listen , is this line hot ?
I just heard someone tap in .
I 'm not paranoid , but I can detect things like that .
Well , even if it is , they know that I know that they know that I have a bulk eraser .
I 'm very clean . "
The Captain pauses , evidently torn between wanting to prove to the phone - company monitors that he does nothing illegal , and the desire to impress Ma Bell with his prowess .
" Ma Bell knows the things I can do , " he continues .
" Ma Bell Knows how good I am .
And I am quite good .
I can detect reversals , tandem switching , everything that goes on on a line .
I have relative pitch now .
Do you know what that means ?
My ears are a $ 20,000 piece of equipment .
With my ears I can detect things they can't hear with their equipment .
I 've had employment problems .
I 've lost jobs .
But I want to show Ma Bell how good I am .
I do n't want to screw her , I want to work for her .
I want to do good for her .
I want to help her get rid of her flaws and become perfect .
That 's my number - one goal in life now . "
The Captain concludes his warnings and tells me he has to be going .
" I 've got a little action lined up for tonight , " he explains and hangs up .
Before I hang up for the night , I call Joe Engressia back .
He reports that his tormentor has finally gone to sleep 
" He 's not blind drunk , that 's the way I get , ahem , yes ; but you might say he 's in a drunken stupor . "
I make a date to visit Joe in Memphis in two days .
A Phone Phreak Cell Takes Care of Business
The next morning I attend a gathering of four phone phreaks in ----- ( a California suburb ) .
The gathering takes place in a comfortable split - level home in an upper - middle - class subdivision .
Heaped on the kitchen table are the portable cassette recorders , M- F cassettes , phone patches , and line ties of the four phone phreaks present .
On the kitchen counter next to the telephone is a shoe - box - size blue box with thirteen large toggle switches for the tones .
The parents of the host phone phreak , Ralph , who is blind , stay in the living room with their sighted children .
They are not sure exactly what Ralph and his friends do with the phone or if it 's strictly legal , but he is blind and they are pleased he has a hobby which keeps him busy .
The group has been working at reestablishing the historic " 2111 " conference , reopening some toll - free loops , and trying to discover the dimensions of what seem to be new initiatives against phone phreaks by phone - company security agents .
It is not long before I get a chance to see , to hear , Randy at work .
Randy is known among the phone phreaks as perhaps the finest con man in the game .
Randy is blind .
He is pale , soft and pear - shaped , he wears baggy pants and a wrinkly nylon white sport shirt , pushes his head forward from hunched shoulders somewhat like a turtle inching out of its shell .
His eyes wander , crossing and recrossing , and his forehead is somewhat pimply .
He is only sixteen years old .
But when Randy starts speaking into a telephone mouthpiece his voice becomes so stunningly authoritative it is necessary to look again to convince yourself it comes from a chubby adolescent Randy .
Imagine the voice of a crack oil - rig foreman , a tough , sharp , weather - beaten Marlboro man of forty .
Imagine the voice of a brilliant performance - fund gunslinger explaining how he beats the Dow Jones by thirty percent .
Then imagine a voice that could make those two sound like Stepin Fetchit .
That is sixteen - year - old Randy 's voice .
He is speaking to a switchman in Detroit .
The phone company in Detroit had closed up two toll - free loop pairs for no apparent reason , although heavy use by phone phreaks all over the country may have been detected .
Randy is telling the switchman how to open up the loop and make it free again :
" How are you , buddy .
Yeah .
I'm on the board in here in Tulsa , Oklahoma , and we 've been trying to run some tests on your loop - arounds and we find 'em busied out on both sides ....
Yeah , we 've been getting a ' BY ' on them , what d'ya say , can you drop cards on 'em ?
Do you have 08 on your number group ?
Oh that 's okay , we 've had this trouble before , we may have to go after the circuit .
Here lemme give 'em to you : your frame is 05 , vertical group 03 , horizontal 5 , vertical file 3 .
Yeah , we 'll hang on here ....
Okay , found it ?
Good .
Right , yeah , we 'd like to clear that busy out .
Right .
All you have to do is look for your key on the mounting plate , it 's in your miscellaneous trunk frame .
Okay ?
Right .
Now pull your key from NOR over the LCT .
Yeah .
I do n't know why that happened , but we 've been having trouble with that one .
Okay .
Thanks a lot fella .
Be seein ' ya . "
Randy hangs up , reports that the switchman was a little inexperienced with the loop - around circuits on the miscellaneous trunk frame , but that the loop has been returned to its free - call status .
Delighted , phone phreak
Ed returns the pair of numbers to the active - status column in his directory .
Ed is a superb and painstaking researcher .
With almost Talmudic thoroughness he will trace tendrils of hints through soft - wired mazes of intervening phone - company circuitry back through complex linkages of switching relays to find the location and identity of just one toll - free loop .
He spends hours and hours , every day , doing this sort of thing .
He has somehow compiled a directory of eight hundred " Band - six in - WATS numbers " located in over forty states .
Band - six in -WATS numbers are the big 800 numbers  the ones that can be dialed into free from anywhere in the country .
Ed the researcher , a nineteen - year - old engineering student , is also a superb technician .
He put together his own working blue box from scratch at age seventeen .
( He is sighted . )
This evening after distributing the latest issue of his in - WATS directory ( which has been typed into Braille for the blind phone phreaks ) , he announces he has made a major new breakthrough :
" I finally tested it and it works , perfectly .
I 've got this switching matrix which converts any touch - tone phone into an M - F- er . "
The tones you hear in touch - tone phones are not the M- F tones that operate the long - distance switching system .
Phone phreaks believe A.T.&T. had deliberately equipped touch tones with a different set of frequencies to avoid putting the six master M- F tones in the hands of every touch - tone owner .
Ed 's complex switching matrix puts the six master tones , in effect puts a blue box , in the hands of every touch - tone owner .
Ed shows me pages of schematics , specifications and parts lists .
" It 's not easy to build , but everything here is in the Heathkit catalog . "
Ed asks Ralph what progress he has made in his attempts to reestablish a long - term open conference line for phone phreaks .
The last big conference  the historic " 2111 " conference  had been arranged through an unused Telex test - board trunk somewhere in the innards of a 4A switching machine in Vancouver , Canada .
For months phone phreaks could M- F their way into Vancouver , beep out 604 ( the Vancouver area code ) and then beep out 2111 ( the internal phone - company code for Telex testing ) , and find themselves at any time , day or night , on an open wire talking with an array of phone phreaks from coast to coast , operators from Bermuda , Tokyo and London who are phone - phreak sympathizers , and miscellaneous guests and technical experts .
The conference was a massive exchange of information .
Phone phreaks picked each other 's brains clean , then developed new ways to pick the phone company 's brains clean .
Ralph gave M F Boogies concerts with his home - entertainment - type electric organ , Captain Crunch demonstrated his round - the - world prowess with his notorious computerized unit and dropped leering hints of the " action " he was getting with his girl friends .
( The Captain lives out or pretends to live out several kinds of fantasies to the gossipy delight of the blind phone phreaks who urge him on to further triumphs on behalf of all of them . )
The somewhat rowdy Northwest phone - phreak crowd let their bitter internal feud spill over into the peaceable conference line , escalating shortly into guerrilla warfare ; Carl the East Coast international tone relations expert demonstrated newly opened direct M- F routes to central offices on the island of Bahrain in the Persian Gulf , introduced a new phone - phreak friend of his in Pretoria , and explained the technical operation of the new Oakland - to - Vietnam linkages .
( Many phone phreaks pick up spending money by M - F-ing calls from relatives to Vietnam G.I.'s , charging $ 5 for a whole hour of trans - Pacific conversation . )
Day and night the conference line was never dead .
Blind phone phreaks all over the country , lonely and isolated in homes filled with active sighted brothers and sisters , or trapped with slow and unimaginative blind kids in straitjacket schools for the blind , knew that no matter how late it got they could dial up the conference and find instant electronic communion with two or three other blind kids awake over on the other side of America .
Talking together on a phone hookup , the blind phone phreaks say , is not much different from being there together .
Physically , there was nothing more than a two - inch - square wafer of titanium inside a vast machine on Vancouver Island .
For the blind kids there meant an exhilarating feeling of being in touch , through a kind of skill and magic which was peculiarly their own .
Last April 1 , however , the long Vancouver Conference was shut off .
The phone phreaks knew it was coming .
Vancouver was in the process of converting from a step - by - step system to a 4A machine and the 2111 Telex circuit was to be wiped out in the process .
The phone phreaks learned the actual day on which the conference would be erased about a week ahead of time over the phone company 's internal - news - and - shop - talk recording .
For the next frantic seven days every phone phreak in America was on and off the 2111 conference twenty - four hours a day .
Phone phreaks who were just learning the game or did n't have M- F capability were boosted up to the conference by more experienced phreaks so they could get a glimpse of what it was like before it disappeared .
Top phone phreaks searched distant area codes for new conference possibilities without success .
Finally in the early morning of April 1 , the end came .
" I could feel it coming a couple hours before midnight , " Ralph remembers .
" You could feel something going on in the lines .
Some static began showing up , then some whistling wheezing sound .
Then there were breaks .
Some people got cut off and called right back in , but after a while some people were finding they were cut off and could n't get back in at all .
It was terrible .
I lost it about one a.m. , but managed to slip in again and stay on until the thing died ...
I think it was about four in the morning .
There were four of us still hanging on when the conference disappeared into nowhere for good .
We all tried to M - F up to it again of course , but we got silent termination .
There was nothing there . "
The Legendary Mark Bernay Turns Out To Be
" The Midnight Skulker "
Mark Bernay .
I had come across that name before .
It was on Gilbertson 's select list of phone phreaks .
The California phone phreaks had spoken of a mysterious Mark Bernay as perhaps the first and oldest phone phreak on the West Coast .
And in fact almost every phone phreak in the West can trace his origins either directly to Mark Bernay or to a disciple of Mark Bernay .
It seems that five years ago this Mark Bernay ( a pseudonym he chose for himself ) began traveling up and down the West Coast pasting tiny stickers in phone books all along his way .
The stickers read something like " Want to hear an interesting tape recording ?
Call these numbers . "
The numbers that followed were toll - free loop - around pairs .
When one of the curious called one of the numbers he would hear a tape recording pre-hooked into the loop by Bernay which explained the use of loop - around pairs , gave the numbers of several more , and ended by telling the caller , " At six o'clock tonight this recording will stop and you and your friends can try it out .
Have fun . "
" I was disappointed by the response at first , " Bernay told me , when I finally reached him at one of his many numbers and he had dispensed with the usual " I never do anything illegal " formalities with which experienced phone phreaks open most conversations .
" I went all over the coast with these stickers not only on pay phones , but I 'd throw them in front of high schools in the middle of the night , I 'd leave them unobtrusively in candy stores , scatter them on main streets of small towns .
At first hardly anyone bothered to try it out .
I would listen in for hours and hours after six o'clock and no one came on .
I could n't figure out why people would n't be interested .
Finally these two girls in Oregon tried it out and told all their friends and suddenly it began to spread . "
Before his Johnny Appleseed trip Bernay had already gathered a sizable group of early pre-blue - box phone phreaks together on loop - arounds in Los Angeles .
Bernay does not claim credit for the original discovery of the loop - around numbers .
He attributes the discovery to an eighteen - year - old reform - school kid in Long Beach whose name he forgets and who , he says , " just disappeared one day . "
When Bernay himself discovered loop - arounds independently , from clues in his readings in old issues of the Automatic Electric Technical Journal , he found dozens of the reform - school kid 's friends already using them .
However , it was one of Bernay 's disciples in Seattle that introduced phone phreaking to blind kids .
The Seattle kid who learned about loops through Bernay 's recording told a blind friend , the blind kid taught the secret to his friends at a winter camp for blind kids in Los Angeles .
When the camp session was over these kids took the secret back to towns all over the West .
This is how the original blind kids became phone phreaks .
For them , for most phone phreaks in general , it was the discovery of the possibilities of loop - arounds which led them on to far more serious and sophisticated phone - phreak methods , and which gave them a medium for sharing their discoveries .
A year later a blind kid who moved back east brought the technique to a blind kids ' summer camp in Vermont , which spread it along the East Coast .
All from a Mark Bernay sticker .
Bernay , who is nearly thirty years old now , got his start when he was fifteen and his family moved into an L.A. suburb serviced by General Telephone and Electronics equipment .
He became fascinated with the differences between Bell and G.T.&E. equipment .
He learned he could make interesting things happen by carefully timed clicks with the disengage button .
He learned to interpret subtle differences in the array of clicks , whirrs and kachinks he could hear on his lines .
He learned he could shift himself around the switching relays of the L.A. area code in a not - too - predictable fashion by interspersing his own hook - switch clicks with the clicks within the line .
( Independent phone companies  there are nineteen hundred of them still left , most of them tiny island principalities in Ma Bell 's vast empire  have always been favorites with phone phreaks , first as learning tools , then as Archimedes platforms from which to manipulate the huge Bell system .
A phone phreak in Bell territory will often M- F himself into an independent 's switching system , with switching idiosyncrasies which can give him marvelous leverage over the Bell System .
" I have a real affection for Automatic Electric equipment , " Bernay told me .
" There are a lot of things you can play with .
Things break down in interesting ways . "
Shortly after Bernay graduated from college ( with a double major in chemistry and philosophy ) , he graduated from phreaking around with G.T.&E. to the Bell System itself , and made his legendary sticker - pasting journey north along the coast , settling finally in Northwest Pacific Bell territory .
He discovered that if Bell does not break down as interestingly as G.T.&E. , it nevertheless offers a lot of " things to play with . "
Bernay learned to play with blue boxes .
He established his own personal switchboard and phone - phreak research laboratory complex .
He continued his phone - phreak evangelism with ongoing sticker campaigns .
He set up two recording numbers , one with instructions for beginning phone phreaks , the other with latest news and technical developments ( along with some advanced instruction ) gathered from sources all over the country .
These days , Bernay told me , he had gone beyond phone - phreaking itself .
" Lately I 've been enjoying playing with computers more than playing with phones .
My personal thing in computers is just like with phones , I guess  the kick is in finding out how to beat the system , how to get at things I 'm not supposed to know about , how to do things with the system that I 'm not supposed to be able to do . "
As a matter of fact , Bernay told me , he had just been fired from his computer - programming job for doing things he was not supposed to be able to do .
He had been working with a huge time - sharing computer owned by a large corporation but shared by many others .
Access to the computer was limited to those programmers and corporations that had been assigned certain passwords .
And each password restricted its user to access to only the one section of the computer cordoned off from its own information storager .
The password system prevented companies and individuals from stealing each other 's information .
" I figured out how to write a program that would let me read everyone else 's password , " Bernay reports .
" I began playing around with passwords .
I began letting the people who used the computer know , in subtle ways , that I knew their passwords .
I began dropping notes to the computer supervisors with hints that I knew what I know .
I signed them ' The Midnight Skulker . '
I kept getting cleverer and cleverer with my messages and devising ways of showing them what I could do .
I 'm sure they could n't imagine I could do the things I was showing them .
But they never responded to me .
Every once in a while they 'd change the passwords , but I found out how to discover what the new ones were , and I let them know .
But they never responded directly to The Midnight Skulker .
I even finally designed a program which they could use to prevent my program from finding out what it did .
In effect I told them how to wipe me out , The Midnight Skulker .
It was a very clever program .
I started leaving clues about myself .
I wanted them to try and use it and then try to come up with something to get around that and reappear again .
But they would n't play .
I wanted to get caught .
I mean I did n't want to get caught personally , but I wanted them to notice me and admit that they noticed me .
I wanted them to attempt to respond , maybe in some interesting way . "
Finally the computer managers became concerned enough about the threat of information - stealing to respond .
However , instead of using The Midnight Skulker 's own elegant self - destruct program , they called in their security personnel , interrogated everyone , found an informer to identify Bernay as The Midnight Skulker , and fired him .
" At first the security people advised the company to hire me full - time to search out other flaws and discover other computer freaks .
I might have liked that .
But I probably would have turned into a double double agent rather than the double agent they wanted .
I might have resurrected The Midnight Skulker and tried to catch myself .
Who knows ?
Anyway , the higher - ups turned the whole idea down . "
You Can Tap the F.B.I.'s Crime Control
Computer in the Comfort of Your
Own Home , Perhaps
Computer freaking may be the wave of the future .
It suits the phone - phreak sensibility perfectly .
Gilbertson , the blue - box inventor and a lifelong phone phreak , has also gone on from phone - phreaking to computer - freaking .
Before he got into the blue - box business Gilbertson , who is a highly skilled programmer , devised programs for international currency arbitrage .
But he began playing with computers in earnest when he learned he could use his blue box in tandem with the computer terminal installed in his apartment by the instrumentation firm he worked for .
The print - out terminal and keyboard was equipped with acoustical coupling , so that by coupling his little ivory Princess phone to the terminal and then coupling his blue box on that , he could M - F his way into other computers with complete anonymity , and without charge ; program and re-program them at will ; feed them false or misleading information ; tap and steal from them .
He explained to me that he taps computers by busying out all the lines , then going into a verification trunk , listening into the passwords and instructions one of the time sharers uses , and them M - F-ing in and imitating them .
He believes it would not be impossible to creep into the F.B.I 's crime control computer through a local police computer terminal and phreak around with the F.B.I.'s memory banks .
He claims he has succeeded in re-programming a certain huge institutional computer in such a way that it has cordoned off an entire section of its circuitry for his personal use , and at the same time conceals the arrangement from anyone else 's notice .
I have been unable to verify this claim .
Like Captain Crunch , like Alexander Graham Bell ( pseudonym of a disgruntled - looking East Coast engineer who claims to have invented the black box and now sells black and blue boxes to gamblers and radical heavies ) , like most phone phreaks , Gilbertson began his career trying to rip off pay phones as a teen - ager .
Figure them out , then rip them off .
Getting his dime back from the pay phone is the phone phreak 's first thrilling rite of passage .
After learning the usual eighteen different ways of getting his dime back , Gilbertson learned how to make master keys to coin - phone cash boxes , and get everyone else 's dimes back .
He stole some phone - company equipment and put together his own home switchboard with it .
He learned to make a simple " bread - box " device , of the kind used by bookies in the Thirties ( bookie gives a number to his betting clients ; the phone with that number is installed in some widow lady 's apartment , but is rigged to ring in the bookie 's shop across town , cops trace big betting number and find nothing but the widow ) .
Not long after that afternoon in 1968 when , deep in the stacks of an engineering library , he came across a technical journal with the phone tone frequencies and rushed off to make his first blue box , not long after that Gilbertson abandoned a very promising career in physical chemistry and began selling blue boxes for $ 1,500 apiece .
" I had to leave physical chemistry .
I just ran out of interesting things to learn , " he told me one evening .
We had been talking in the apartment of the man who served as the link between Gilbertson and the syndicate in arranging the big $ 300,000 blue - box deal which fell through because of legal trouble .
There has been some smoking .
" No more interesting things to learn , " he continues .
" Physical chemistry turns out to be a sick subject when you take it to its highest level .
I do n't know .
I do n't think I could explain to you how it 's sick .
You have to be there .
But you get , I do n't know , a false feeling of omnipotence .
I suppose it 's like phone - phreaking that way .
This huge thing is there .
This whole system .
And there are holes in it and you slip into them like Alice and you 're pretending you 're doing something you 're actually not , or at least it 's no longer you that 's doing what you thought you were doing .
It 's all Lewis Carroll .
Physical chemistry and phone - phreaking .
That 's why you have these phone - phreak pseudonyms like The Cheshire Cat , The Red King , and The Snark .
But there 's something about phone - phreaking that you do n't find in physical chemistry . "
He looks up at me :
" Did you ever steal anything ? "
Well yes , I 
" Then you know !
You know the rush you get .
It 's not just knowledge , like physical chemistry .
It 's forbidden knowledge .
You know .
You can learn about anything under the sun and be bored to death with it .
But the idea that it 's illegal .
Look : you can be small and mobile and smart and you 're ripping off somebody large and powerful and very dangerous . "
People like Gilbertson and Alexander Graham Bell are always talking about ripping off the phone company and screwing Ma Bell .
But if they were shown a single button and told that by pushing it they could turn the entire circuitry of A.T.&T. into molten puddles , they probably would n't push it .
The disgruntled - inventor phone phreak needs the phone system the way the lapsed Catholic needs the Church , the way Satan needs a God , the way The Midnight Skulker needed , more than anything else , response .
Later that evening Gilbertson finished telling me how delighted he was at the flood of blue boxes spreading throughout the country , how delighted he was to know that " this time they 're really screwed . "
He suddenly shifted gears .
" Of course , I do have this love / hate thing about Ma Bell .
In a way I almost like the phone company .
I guess I 'd be very sad if they were to go away or if their services were to disintegrate .
In a way it 's just that after having been so good they turn out to have these things wrong with them .
It 's those flaws that allow me to get in and mess with them , but I do n't know .
There 's something about it that gets to you and makes you want to get to it , you know . "
I ask him what happens when he runs out of interesting , forbidden things to learn about the phone system .
" I do n't know , maybe I 'd go to work for them for a while . "
In security even ?
" I 'd do it , sure .
I just as soon play 
I 'd just as soon work on either side . "
Even figuring out how to trap phone phreaks ?
I said , recalling Mark Bernay 's game .
" Yes , that might be interesting .
Yes , I could figure out how to outwit the phone phreaks .
Of course if I got too good at it , it might become boring again .
Then I 'd have to hope the phone phreaks got much better and outsmarted me for a while .
That would move the quality of the game up one level .
I might even have to help them out , you know , ' Well kids , I would n't want this to get around but did you ever think of  ? '
I could keep it going at higher and higher levels forever . "
The dealer speaks up for the first time .
He has been staring at the soft blinking patterns of lights and colors on the translucent tiled wall facing him .
( Actually there are no patterns : the color and illumination of every tile is determined by a computerized random - number generator designed by Gilbertson which insures that there can be no meaning to any sequence of events in the tiles . )
" Those are nice games you 're talking about , " says the dealer to his friend .
" But I would n't mind seeing them screwed .
A telephone is n't private anymore .
You can't say anything you really want to say on a telephone or you have to go through that paranoid bull ----. ' Is it cool to talk on the phone ? '
I mean , even if it is cool , if you have to ask ' Is it cool , ' then it is n't cool .
You know .
Like those blind kids , people are going to start putting together their own private telephone companies if they want to really talk .
And you know what else .
You do n't hear silences on the phone anymore .
They 've got this time - sharing thing on long - distance lines where you make a pause and they snip out that piece of time and use it to carry part of somebody else 's conversation .
Instead of a pause , where somebody 's maybe breathing or sighing , you get this blank hole and you only start hearing again when someone says a word and even the beginning of the word is clipped off .
Silences do n't count  you 're paying for them , but they take them away from you .
It 's not cool to talk and you can't hear someone when they do n't talk .
What the hell good is the phone ?
I would n't mind seeing them totally screwed . "
The Big Memphis Bust
Joe Engressia never wanted to screw Ma Bell .
His dream had always been to work for her .
The day I visited Joe in his small apartment on Union Avenue in Memphis , he was upset about another setback in his application for a telephone job .
" They 're stalling on it .
I got a letter today telling me they'd have to postpone the interview I requested again .
My landlord read it for me .
They gave me some runaround about wanting papers on my rehabilitation status but I think there 's something else going on . "
When I switched on the 40 - watt bulb in Joe 's room  he sometimes forgets when he has guests  it looked as if there was enough telephone hardware to start a small phone company of his own .
There is one phone on top of his desk , one phone sitting in an open drawer beneath the desk top .
Next to the desk - top phone is a cigar - box - size M- F device with big toggle switches , and next to that is some kind of switching and coupling device with jacks and alligator plugs hanging loose .
Next to that is a Braille typewriter .
On the floor next to the desk , lying upside down like a dead tortoise , is the half - gutted body of an old black standard phone .
Across the room on a torn and dusty couch are two more phones , one of them a touch - tone model ; two tape recorders ; a heap of phone patches and cassettes , and a life - size toy telephone .
Our conversation is interrupted every ten minutes by phone phreaks from all over the country ringing Joe on just about every piece of equipment but the toy phone and the Braille typewriter .
One fourteen - year - old blind kid from Connecticut calls up and tells Joe he 's got a girl friend .
He wants to talk to Joe about girl friends .
Joe says they 'll talk later in the evening when they can be alone on the line .
Joe draws a deep breath , whistles him off the air with an earsplitting 2600 - cycle whistle .
Joe is pleased to get the calls but he looked worried and preoccupied that evening , his brow constantly furrowed over his dark wandering eyes .
In addition to the phone - company stall , he has just learned that his apartment house is due to be demolished in sixty days for urban renewal .
For all its shabbiness , the Union Avenue apartment house has been Joe 's first home - of - his - own and he 's worried that he may not find another before this one is demolished .
But what really bothers
Joe is that switchmen have n't been listening to him .
" I 've been doing some checking on 800 numbers lately , and I 've discovered that certain 800 numbers in New Hampshire could n't be reached from Missouri and Kansas .
Now it may sound like a small thing , but I do n't like to see sloppy work ; it makes me feel bad about the lines .
So I 've been calling up switching offices and reporting it , but they have n't corrected it .
I called them up for the third time today and instead of checking they just got mad .
Well , that gets me mad .
I mean , I do try to help them .
There 's something about them I can't understand  you want to help them and they just try to say you 're defrauding them . "
It is Sunday evening and Joe invites me to join him for dinner at a Holiday Inn .
Frequently on Sunday evening Joe takes some of his welfare money , calls a cab , and treats himself to a steak dinner at one of Memphis ' thirteen Holiday Inns .
( Memphis is the headquarters of Holiday Inn. Holiday Inns have been a favorite for Joe ever since he made his first solo phone trip to a Bell switching office in Jacksonville , Florida , and stayed in the Holiday Inn there .
He likes to stay at Holiday Inns , he explains , because they represent freedom to him and because the rooms are arranged the same all over the country so he knows that any Holiday Inn room is familiar territory to him .
Just like any telephone . )
Over steaks in the Pinnacle Restaurant of the Holiday Inn Medical Center on Madison Avenue in Memphis , Joe tells me the highlights of his life as a phone phreak .
At age seven , Joe learned his first phone trick .
A mean baby - sitter , tired of listening to little Joe play with the phone as he always did , constantly , put a lock on the phone dial .
" I got so mad .
When there 's a phone sitting there and I can't use it . . . so I started getting mad and banging the receiver up and down .
I noticed I banged it once and it dialed one .
Well , then I tried banging it twice .
. . . "
In a few minutes Joe learned how to dial by pressing the hook switch at the right time .
" I was so excited I remember going ' whoo whoo ' and beat a box down on the floor . "
At age eight Joe learned about whistling .
" I was listening to some intercept nonworking - number recording in L.A. 
I was calling L.A. as far back as that , but I 'd mainly dial nonworking numbers because there was no charge , and I 'd listen to these recordings all day .
Well , I was whistling ' cause listening to these recordings can be boring after a while even if they are from L.A. , and all of a sudden , in the middle of whistling , the recording clicked off .
I fiddled around whistling some more , and the same thing happened .
So I called up the switch room and said , ' I 'm Joe .
I 'm eight years old and I want to know why when I whistle this tune the line clicks off . '
He tried to explain it to me , but it was a little too technical at the time .
I went on learning .
That was a thing nobody was going to stop me from doing .
The phones were my life , and I was going to pay any price to keep on learning .
I knew I could go to jail .
But I had to do what I had to do to keep on learning . "
The phone is ringing when we walk back into Joe 's apartment on Union Avenue .
It is Captain Crunch .
The Captain has been following me around by phone , calling up everywhere I go with additional bits of advice and explanation for me and whatever phone phreak I happen to be visiting .
This time the Captain reports he is calling from what he describes as " my hideaway high up in the Sierra Nevada . "
He pulses out lusty salvos of M-F and tells Joe he is about to " go out and get a little action tonight .
Do some phreaking of another kind , if you know what I mean . "
Joe chuckles .
The Captain then tells me to make sure I understand that what he told me about tying up the nation 's phone lines was true , but that he and the phone phreaks he knew never used the technique for sabotage .
They only learned the technique to help the phone company .
" We do a lot of troubleshooting for them .
Like this New Hampshire / Missouri WATS - line flaw I 've been screaming about .
We help them more than they know . "
After we say good - bye to the Captain and Joe whistles him off the line , Joe tells me about a disturbing dream he had the night before : " I had been caught and they were taking me to a prison .
It was a long trip .
They were taking me to a prison a long long way away .
And we stopped at a Holiday Inn and it was my last night ever at a Holiday Inn , and it was my last night ever using the phone and I was crying and crying , and the lady at the Holiday Inn said , ' Gosh , honey , you should never be sad at a Holiday Inn .
You should always be happy here .
Especially since it 's your last night . '
And that just made it worse and I was sobbing so much I could n't stand it . "
Two weeks after I left Joe Engressia 's apartment , phone - company security agents and Memphis police broke into it .
Armed with a warrant , which they left pinned to a wall , they confiscated every piece of equipment in the room , including his toy telephone .
Joe was placed under arrest and taken to the city jail where he was forced to spend the night since he had no money and knew no one in Memphis to call .
It is not clear who told Joe what that night , but someone told him that the phone company had an open - and - shut case against him because of revelations of illegal activity he had made to a phone - company undercover agent .
By morning Joe had become convinced that the reporter from Esquire , with whom he had spoken two weeks ago , was the undercover agent .
He probably had ugly thoughts about someone he could n't see gaining his confidence , listening to him talk about his personal obsessions and dreams , while planning all the while to lock him up .
" I really thought he was a reporter , " Engressia told the Memphis Press - Scimitar .
" I told him everything .... "
Feeling betrayed , Joe proceeded to confess everything to the press and police .
As it turns out , the phone company did use an undercover agent to trap Joe , although it was not the Esquire reporter .
Ironically , security agents were alerted and began to compile a case against Joe because of one of his acts of love for the system :
Joe had called an internal service department to report that he had located a group of defective long - distance trunks , and to complain again about the New Hampshire / Missouri WATS problem .
Joe always liked Ma Bell 's lines to be clean and responsive .
A suspicious switchman reported Joe to the security agents who discovered that Joe had never had a long - distance call charged to his name .
Then the security agents learned that Joe was planning one of his phone trips to a local switching office .
The security people planted one of their agents in the switching office .
He posed as a student switchman and followed Joe around on a tour .
He was extremely friendly and helpful to Joe , leading him around the office by the arm .
When the tour was over he offered Joe a ride back to his apartment house .
On the way he asked Joe  one tech man to another  about " those blue boxes " he 'd heard about .
Joe talked about them freely , talked about his blue box freely , and about all the other things he could do with the phones .
The next day the phone - company security agents slapped a monitoring tape on Joe 's line , which eventually picked up an illegal call .
Then they applied for the search warrant and broke in .
In court Joe pleaded not guilty to possession of a blue box and theft of service .
A sympathetic judge reduced the charges to malicious mischief and found him guilty on that count , sentenced him to two thirty - day sentences to be served concurrently and then suspended the sentence on condition that Joe promise never to play with phones again .
Joe promised , but the phone company refused to restore his service .
For two weeks after the trial Joe could not be reached except through the pay phone at his apartment house , and the landlord screened all calls for him .
Phone - phreak Carl managed to get through to Joe after the trial , and reported that Joe sounded crushed by the whole affair .
" What I 'm worried about , " Carl told me , " is that Joe means it this time .
The promise .
That he 'll never phone - phreak again .
That 's what he told me , that he 's given up phone - phreaking for good .
I mean his entire life .
He says he knows they 're going to be watching him so closely for the rest of his life he 'll never be able to make a move without going straight to jail .
He sounded very broken up by the whole experience of being in jail .
It was awful to hear him talk that way .
I do n't know .
I hope maybe he had to sound that way .
Over the phone , you know . "
He reports that the entire phone - phreak underground is up in arms over the phone company 's treatment of Joe .
" All the while Joe had his hopes pinned on his application for a phone - company job , they were stringing him along getting ready to bust him .
That gets me mad .
Joe spent most of his time helping them out .
The bastards .
They think they can use him as an example .
All of sudden they 're harassing us on the coast .
Agents are jumping up on our lines .
They just busted ------'s mute yesterday and ripped out his lines .
But no matter what Joe does , I do n't think we 're going to take this lying down . "
Two weeks later my phone rings and about eight phone phreaks in succession say hello from about eight different places in the country , among them Carl , Ed , and Captain Crunch .
A nationwide phone - phreak conference line has been reestablished through a switching machine in -------- , with the cooperation of a disgruntled switchman .
" We have a special guest with us today , " Carl tells me .
The next voice I hear is Joe's .
He reports happily that he has just moved to a place called Millington , Tennessee , fifteen miles outside of Memphis , where he has been hired as a telephone - set repairman by a small independent phone company .
Someday he hopes to be an equipment troubleshooter .
" It 's the kind of job I dreamed about .
They found out about me from the publicity surrounding the trial .
Maybe Ma Bell did me a favor busting me .
I 'll have telephones in my hands all day long . "
" You know the expression , ' Do n't get mad , get even ' ? " phone - phreak Carl asked me .
" Well , I think they 're going to be very sorry about what they did to Joe and what they 're trying to do to us . "

Apple Store makeovers
Apple is planning major changes to the interior layout of Apple Stores , a new report indicates .
The company is said to be looking at de-emphasizing hardware , pushing Macs and iPods aside to focus on software and other less tangible content .
Part of the effort should include a " Why You 'll Love a Mac " section at the front of each store , using signs and brochures to contrast Macs with Windows PCs .
Nearby should be a second section devoted to iLife , followed by a third concentrated around iWork .
Rumors suggest that the reorganization may start as soon as next week , but completion could demand several more weeks in order to swap out signs and retrain workers .
The plans may suggest that Apple no longer sees its computer hardware as inherently distinct , or simply that the company wants to spark sales of iLife and iWork .
New versions of the suites were announced during Macworld 2009 .
Exclusive to STR
You 'll be wondering about that question mark .
As Dave Barry so accurately put it , '. . . the troubled ' big three ' auto makers . . . ask Congress for $ 25 billion , explaining that if they do n't get the money , they will be unable to continue making cars that Americans are not buying . '
Others suggest that once bailed - out , the Big Three will no longer make cars , but will just keep paying the pensions to their former workers , which they so foolishly promised way back when .
So it does seem that fewer goods are being produced and that a reduced level of production will continue for quite a while .
Since a vast amount of new money has been deliberately injected fresh from the government print - room into the economy , surely there can be but one result , when that larger sum of money chases the smaller quantity of goods : a serious price hike , starting later this year .
Steep price inflation looks like a sure thing .
However , my first reason for adding the question mark is that prices are actually set by vendors , and if -- as now -- vendors are scrambling to keep solvent and make sales , they will not rush to raise them .
If survival is at stake -- and for many , it is -- they will more likely reduce prices , so as to make at least some sales and stay in business , albeit with poor or zero profits .
We can see this happening right now ; retailers marked goods down before Christmas , and even further afterwards .
Gasoline prices have dropped 60 % in six months .
House prices are down 20 % from their 2005 peak , sometimes more , and stocks are down by a third or so .
All car makers are pleading for customers with strong incentives .
Possibly these trends may reverse later this year , but for now they are very clear : despite all the huge " injections of liquidity , " prices are tumbling off cliffs .
My second reason comes more as a question than an assertion : I am wondering where the money went , when trillions were wiped off housing values and the stock market .
Yes , the Fed is injecting new money , a trillion or two of it , but was that not more of a partial replacement for lost money , than the creation of new currency where none previously existed ?
If it was , then the above premise -- that more money is chasing fewer goods -- is incorrect ; yes , there are fewer goods , but no , there may not be much more money , if any .
We say rightly that the former price rises in housing and stocks resulted from the irresponsible creation of money by Greenspan and Bernanke , so now that those bubbles have burst , must it not mean that their excess money has vanished in a puff of smoke ?
Perhaps we do n't actually know how much money is there at all .
Perhaps its total supply is actually down , not up .
Perhaps government statistics about money supply ( inadequate anyway , since M3 is omitted ) are simply incorrect ; perhaps they record how much currency was created , but not how much was destroyed .
Was any destroyed ?
It 's not easy to tell .
If one asks Google " Where did all the money go ? " , a variety of answers pop up from all manner of experts , not one of whom shows signs of understanding that the Fed creates money out of thin air , let alone that prices rise as a consequence .
Since they do n't appear to understand the question , their answers are unpersuasive .
One view is that no , none was vaporized .
Take a house , the Fed - inflated 2005 price of which was $ 500 K but which is now down to a less unrealistic $ 400 K .
Where is the missing $ 100 K ?
Owner - occupier John has a $ 450 K loan and enjoys living in the house , so he lost nothing , except expectations .
His mortgage banker is still getting paid to the terms agreed ( because John still has a job ) and so he , too , lost nothing -- yet .
They say money may be distributed differently , but it 's still there , in the system .
What was lost was merely a book entry in John 's net - worth account .
He thought he had a $ 500 K asset of which $ 50 K ( say ) was net equity which might be used , thanks to a further home - equity loan , to put young Patrick through a year of Harvard ; but now , he does n't .
He 's in the hole for $ 50 K , so Patrick will have to flip burgers and go to night school .
But still , does that mean the money supply shrank ?
A quick reference to Murray Rothbard 's trusty What Has Government Done to Our Money reminds us that fiat money is fabricated by an engine with two parts : first the Feds write a large IOU to the Fed , which the latter buys with a kited check .
Then the Feds use that large influx to make payments to their suppliers , employees , supporters , clients , pimps and hangers - on , which the latter deposit in their local , friendly Federal Reserve member bank .
As the second part of the engine , each such deposit can then be loaned out again to the extent of 90 % .
Those loans get re-deposited , and so the cycle goes ; an original billion - dollar IOU turns after some weeks or months into a ten billion dollar supply of new " money . "
So in John 's case , the money supply may not have shrunk , but it did fail to grow as expected .
The reason is that if he'd had that net home equity of $ 50 K , he would have taken out a new loan to pay Patrick 's college bill , and that money would have been plucked from thin air as above by the bankers ' " fractional reserve " system , the magic wand that creates money ; but he did n't .
If John never takes out the $ 50 K loan , because the book value of his house went down instead of up , a wrench gets tossed in to that engine ; nothing is created beyond the original IOU injected by the Feds .
The fall in John 's house value has therefore stopped the fiat engine in mid-crank ; back in D.C. , the magic wands are being waved , but the rabbit remains in the hat .
This may be why there is so little hesitation in that city about rushing through bills that flood the economy with very large sums ; $ 750 billion a couple of months back , another trillion coming up shortly . . . if that $ 1.75T were being created in normal times , some months later it would get magnified to $ 17.5 trillion by the fractional - reserve multiplier , and that would take the money supply from about $ 12T to nearly $ 30T in less than a year ; an unprecedented explosion of " money " that might well be fatal to an economy upon which , ultimately , even politicians depend .
So why their reckless abandon ?
The explanation may be that they have done this calculation already and know that this time , the multiplier will not work .
They are therefore " safe " in throwing out such large sums -- and if their arithmetic should happen to be a bit off , they can always force a change to the fraction ; that is , forbid banks to lend more than , say , 40 % of their deposits instead of 90 % .
Still , this explanation suffices only to suggest that the money supply will not grow as fast as one might have expected -- not that it will actually shrink .
For it to shrink , John or his neighbors must not only fail to take out new loans , they must also pay down loans that they already have .
Is that happening , or will it soon happen ?
Yes , I think it is .
Every month that forty four million mortgage holders make a payment reducing the principal owed , that 's exactly what they do ; so if new mortgages are not being written to replace them , deposits in banks will fall and the fractional - reserve engine will work in reverse -- destroying money , instead of creating it .
And are new mortgages being written to replace them ?
No !
Because houses are selling very slowly , and when they are sold , the price is lower than it used to be so the new mortgage for the new owner is for a smaller amount than its predecessor .
Further , an unprecedented number are in foreclosure , meaning that the lending bank is having to write off a large part of its former loans .
All those factors mean that the fractional - reserve part of the government 's inflation engine has flipped .
It may be this is the first time that has ever happened , but it seems to me likely that it 's happening now .
What an exciting time !
No wonder that none of the King 's Men seem to have any idea how to put Humpty together again .
I could be wrong about this and have not seen any more scholarly writer put it this way , but I think that in the past few months , a vast amount of money has , for just these reasons , disappeared ; and so that the frantic attempts to use the first component of that engine -- the issuance of IOUs to the Fed , in multiples of $ 100B -- have not had and will not have their normal consequence of high inflation .
I have no idea how to calculate what supply of money really is out there now , nor how much may be destroyed or created in the coming months ; but I suggest that despite the shrinkage of goods being produced and despite that largess of the Feds , there is n't much of a supply increase , if any at all , and so there 's no reason to expect significant price inflation in the coming year .
Only events will prove me right or wrong , but a possible early indicator that I may be right comes in an estimate of M3 published by nowandfutures.com and reproduced here .
It shows that in spite of all we may have supposed , while its absolute total has continued to rise a bit , the rate of increase in the total supply of US money has fallen like a rock , from 17 % to 7 % , since the middle of 2008 .
Go figure .
Letter from Holland February 4 , 2009 09:56 MST
I just received the following letter from Holland :
Yesterday 3 Feb , the Dutch evangelical , TV presentator and former director of the Evangelical Broadcast Organisation ( EO ) , Andries Knevel , openly rejected his belief in Young Earth Creationism and ID .
He apologised for promoting those beliefs in the past years to his children and the public .
He wants credibility , reliability and belief .
He desires an open debate about God and evolution with believers and non-believers alike .
He believes GOD and evolution do not exclude each other .
Both science and belief have their own value .
He still belief that God created heaven and earth en that Jezus is our Saviour .
On July 27 2007 it was discovered and documented http://evolutie.blog.com/1962396/ that the EO censored all evolution and old earth from the BBC documentaries of David Attenborough .
Now the EO no longer denies it was censorship indeed by showing fragments they censored in the past years .
This is a remarkable breakthrough and conversion .
Especially hopeful in the Darwinyear 2009 .
There are still YEC ’s in Holland , but the main evangelical television station has made a very promising move .

Update :
The source is available at github.com / mist64/extract-adf ; more info here .
It is well - known that the “ Kickstart ” disk that came with the original Amiga 1000 in 1985 contained some fragments of source code :
The floppy disk that was used as a master for duplication had been used by the developers before , and had not been erased completely .
Nobody seemed to have looked too closely at what is on this disk – so I did , for this episode of Computer Archeology .
The revealed data tells us about how the Amiga operating system was brought up , how it related to Tripos , and where it was developed .
The Kickstart Disk
When the Amiga 1000 was released , the 1.0 ROM image was not finalized , so the machine shipped with a â Kickstartâ  floppy disk that was loaded into an extra 256 KB RAM bank which was then write - protected .
A double - density Amiga disk is exactly 880 KB , i.e. it consists of 1760 sectors , each 512 bytes in size .
The Kickstart disk has a header on sector 0 ( saying “ KICK ” followed by all zero bytes ) , and the raw ROM image is stored on the following sectors .
The ROM is 256 KB in size , so this means that all sectors from 513 on are unused , and , in the case of the Kickstart 1.0 disk , preserved .
The following analysis has been done on the Kickstart 1.0 ADF disk image with an MD5 of 2fb28e7 bbab0d2eef00e742c7259a674 .
Amiga Old Filesystem
Before version 1.3 of the operating system , disks were formatted with the “ Amiga Old Filesystem “ , which was quite inefficient , as it stored metadata pretty redundantly .
Every single sector , even sectors containing file data , start with a 24 byte header , which contains
the type of the sector ( directory entry , data … )
of the sector ( directory entry , data … ) a pointer to the parent
the sequence number of the sector inside the file
of the sector inside the file the number of valid bytes in the sector
in the sector a pointer to the successor
and a checksum .
Every directory entry occupies a complete sector , and deleting a file means just removing the links to the directory entry sector , without touching the data sectors or the directory entry sector at all .
And what ’s best :
For performance reasons , directory entries are clustered around the center of the disk , i.e. sector 880 , which , in our case , has not been overwritten by the ROM image , so it should be easy to get some data out of this disk .
Extraction Program
The program to extract the data from the disk uses the following algorithm :
It iterates over all sectors from the end of the ROM image to the end of the disk image and looks at the sector type .
If it is a data block , it looks at the parent , in the hope that it is an intact directory entry .
If this is the case , it walks back the list from parent to parent to get the full path and filename of the file .
If the directory entry has not survived , the file will get the index of the directory entry as a name .
As we now know the filename of the file the sector belongs to and we can read the sequence number from the sector header , it is possible to write 488 bytes worth of data into the output file .
Here is the source code of the program to extract the files : extract - adf.c
Results
The disk seemed to have contained C header files and assembly includes earlier , and has then been overwritten with the current set of command line tools of AmigaOS ( the name of the disk “ cli26.1 ” reflects this ) , extended with some custom development tools used by Commodore - Amiga .
Since the DOS part of the Amiga operating system is actually based on the only very slightly modified Metacomco Tripos operating system , the command line tools as well as the development tools mentioned in the following sections are mostly the same as those found in Tripos ; therefore the terms Tripos and AmigaDOS may be used interchangeably .
CLI Programs
The “ c ” subdirectory contains the following command line tools that can also be found on the Workbench 1.0 disk :
Assign Break CD Copy Date Delete Dir DiskCopy Echo Ed Edit EndCLI Execute FailAt Fault Format If Info Install Join Lab List MakeDir NewCLI Prompt Protect Quit Rename Run Search Skip Sort Stack Status Type Wait Why
The following executables can be found in the “ l ” directory :
Disk - Validator
Port - Handler
Ram - Handler
But these may very well be earlier versions .
“ DiskCopy ” for example is significantly smaller than the “ Diskcopy ” that shipped with Workbench 1.0 .
Development Tools
The following command line utilities can also be found in “ c ” .
They do not ship with WorkBench , but are part of a separtare tools disk for developers , as described in the AmigaDOS Manual .
Some also exist on pre-1.0 beta versions of Workbench , although possibly in different versions .
Alink Amiga Linker Version 2.17 , Copyright ( C ) 1985 by Tenchstar Ltd. , T/A Metacomco .
DiskEd AmigaDOS
Disc Editor DownLoad DownLoad version 2.0 , Sun->Amiga transfer utility DumpObj Displays executable hunks in hex
Alink is the Amiga - native version of the TRIPOS / Metacomco linker
According to the AmigaDOS Manual ( or Tripos Technial Reference Manual ) , “ to inspect or patch disk blocks , you may use the AmigaDOS [ Tripos ] disk editor , DISKED . ”
The version on this disk is 3.2 ; the 2.0 + NDKs shipped with 3.4 , and cintpos , the open source release of Tripos , includes the source for 3.0 .
Download is quite interesting , not only because the binary and its documentation are very hard to find , but also because they tell a lot about the history of the Amiga operating system .
According to the AmigaDOS manual , it is used to download “ programs written on another computer ( for example , a Sun ) to the Amiga . ” – the counterpart on the Sun workstation would be “ binload ” .
An interesting side note on this version of “ Download ” is that it still contains all linker symbols , and has a debugging mode ( “ - d ” ) that prints out every step that it is doing , so it is pretty easy to reverse - engineer .
There is strong evidence that the Amiga operating system has been cross developed on Sun machines .
After all , the official Amiga SDK is called “ NDK ” , “ Native Development Kit ” , implying that the original bringup SDK was not native .
At that time ( 1985 ) , Sun Workstations were 68000 - or 68010 - based computers running SunOS 1.x , which was based on 4.1BSD .
The C compiler that came with BSD at that time was the Bell Labs “ Portable C Compiler ” ( PCC ) , which could naturally output 68000 code .
The “ Bell Labs C compiler ” ( i.e. PCC ) is mentioned in a header file in the “ Native Development Kit ” for AmigaOS as printed in “ AMIGA ROM Kernel Reference Manual : Libraries and Devices “ , next to the suggested native compiler “ Lattice C ” and two other compilers , implying that PCC could be used for Amiga development .
The AmigaDOS manual says that “ the tools available on the Sun Microsystem for cross development include the assembler , linker , and two C compilers . ”
One compiler is explicitly mentioned :
It is the “ Greenhills C compiler ” ( metacc ; the name suggests it was Metacomco ’s shipping C compiler for Tripos ) ; the other one is presumably PCC .
According to this resume , the first versions of the ROM were compiled using the Greenhills C compiler .
So Commodore - Amiga must have cross- developed AmigaOS on BSD with the Greenhills C compiler .
New Executables
c /d c / Read serial / parallel port receiving utility c/ ReadPref accesses config / preferences demos / ImageEdit
“ d ” seems to be used to delete files , “ Read ” contains strings about reading from serial and parallel ports , “ ReadPrefs ” accesses the file “ config / preferences ” , which is also included on this disk .
It is unknown what ImageEdit is for – it does not contain any strings , but included linker symbols imply that it deals with timers .
Devices and Libraries
The disk also comes with the Narrator device and the Translator library , which are required for speech synthesis .
These two files have been overwritten once , so there are now two different copies on the disk :
devs/narrator .
device narrator Version 25 ( rev 3 ) ( Thu Jun 20 18:47:53 PDT 1985 ) devs/narrator .
device narrator Version 26 ( rev 1 ) ( Wed Jun 19 14:22:29 PDT 1985 ) libs/translator.library translator Version 26 ( rev 1 ) ( Wed Jun 19 14:49:56 PDT 1985 ) libs/translator.library translator Version 26 ( rev 5 ) ( Thu Jun 20 17:25:49 PDT 1985 )
The header of the libraries contain the respective versions .
Note that the newer version of narrator .
device has the older timestamp .
“ PDT ” implies that AmigaOS has been written on the US West Coast – in the California office of Commodore .
For comparison , Workbench 1.0 shipped with
narrator 1.6 ( 10 Sep 1985 ) translator 1.3 ( 4 Sep 1985 )
Misc Files
config / preferences 240 bytes , mostly 0s , no strings , read by c/ ReadPrefs s/startup - sequence ReadPref

This is an “ ED ” backup of startup - sequence demos / src/wtest.asm Assembly source in Metacomco format ( “ MOVE.L ” ; for “ assem ” ) that prints “ Hello World ” to the console and opens a window .
The source has been generated with “ metacc - S ” .
Files for Development
For many of the files on the disk , the original directory entry has been lost , but it was possible to reconstruct the filename using the printed headers in “ AMIGA ROM Kernel Reference Manual : Libraries and Devices “ , digital versions of older and newer versions of the headers , and the AROS versions of the headers .

There are four more directory entries for executable files :
Assem AmigaDOS / Tripos macro assembler by Metacomco .
Avail shipped with developer tools , and OS >= 1.3 ObjDump probably same as “ DumpObj ” SetPref probably the counterpart to “ ReadPref ”
Conclusion
The following conclusions can be drawn from this exercise :
The reduncandy in the Amiga Old Filesystem makes this filesystem perfect for reconstructing deleted and even partially overwritten data .
AmigaOS seems to have been bootstrapped using SunOS and the Metacomco / Tripos toolchain , and has probably not been self - hosting for 1.0 .
The disk was used to move developer tools and header files between machines .
Version 1.0 of the OS has been developed in the California office of Commodore – the original Amiga office .
Open Questions
What source control system was used ?
How does the version numbering ( “ 26.1 ” etc. ) work ?
How is it related to source control ?
Does the 1.0 NDK still exist somewhere ?
It should have shipped with Lattice C , at least .
It would be very interesting to compare these headers and includes with the 1.0 NDK ones ; for real differences , and for changes in the comments .
What are the differences between these headers and the 1.0 headers ?
Any last minute changes ?

Legislative analyst doubts loans will fly SACRAMENTO Governor 's fiscal plan questioned over difficulty in enticing investors and legality of using loans to balance the state budget

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 's plan to use about $ 10 billion in borrowing to help close an estimated $ 40 billion state budget deficit over next 18 months could face problems , a new report by the nonpartisan legislative analyst said Thursday .
The governor 's borrowing plan faces at least two major hurdles , said Mac Taylor , the state 's legislative analyst .
Finding investors in a credit market that 's in turmoil and a potential legal challenge on whether the state can take out short - term loans to balance the budget each could derail the governor 's efforts .
In presenting his 17 - page analysis of Schwarzenegger 's budget , the legislative analyst said it reflects a good - faith effort to close the state 's colossal deficit , but could be improved with less borrowing and more strategic spending cuts and revenue increases .
Taylor also reiterated the urgency of the state 's financial plight .
" In November , we used words like dire , bleak and awful and since then the problem has gotten a lot worse , " he said .
" And we 're running out of adjectives . "
With California 's budget deficit expected to grow to about $ 40 billion by June 2010 , Schwarzenegger and the Legislature so far have failed to agree on how to close the enormous gap that could grow worse .
H.D. Palmer , a spokesman for the state Department of Finance , said borrowing would have to be part of the budget solution , unless there are deeper spending cuts or even higher taxes , proposals that would be difficult to implement in the struggling economy .
" We knew the ( short - term loans ) would be difficult , " he said .
" We believe we 've put together a comprehensive and balanced plan that closes a historic budget gap . "
Last week , Schwarzenegger 's aides unveiled a budget that seeks to solve the deficit problem with more than $ 17 billion in cuts , including reductions in education , health care and welfare payments .
The governor also proposed to raise more than $ 14 billion from new taxes , including a temporary 1 1/2 - cent increase in the sales tax .
Schwarzenegger also wants to borrow $ 5 billion against future state lottery sales and take out $ 4.6 billion in short - term loans that would be repaid in the 2010 - 11 fiscal year .
Taylor argued that trying to eliminate about one - quarter of the budget deficit through borrowing could be a problem , especially considering the credit market meltdown .
He also warned the $ 4.6 billion short - term loan proposal could face legal challenge because Proposition 58 , passed by voters in 2004 , restricts the state 's ability to borrow for budgetary purposes .
The legislative analyst also suggested calling a special election as early as late April to ask voters to approve a tax package , as well as revising initiatives that voters approved in previous years so that the state could dip into the money generated by those measures .
Republican lawmakers and Schwarzenegger already have proposed using funds collected by Proposition 63 , legislation that Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg , D - Sacramento , carried to fund mental health care for homeless adults , and Proposition 10 , money for children 's health care .
Taylor recommended adding to that list Proposition 99 , a tobacco tax for health care programs , and Proposition 49 , which set aside money for after - school programs , an initiative Schwarzenegger championed in 2002 .
The governor and legislative leaders returned to the negotiating table Thursday , meeting in person for the first time in about a month .
Legislative leaders emerging from a 20 - minute meeting with the governor said they plan to continue negotiating .
" We are going to work with our Republican colleagues and the governor every day , " Steinberg said .
Senate Republican leader Dave Cogdill of Modesto said he expects talks to intensify in coming days and weeks .
" Everyone understands the urgency of the situation we 're dealing with and we 're going to stay at it , " he said .
In January , 2006 , shortly after James Zadroga died at his parents ’ house , in Little Egg Harbor , New Jersey , Dr. Gerard Breton received a call from the Ocean County Medical Examiner ’s Office .
A retired hospital pathologist , Breton now conducts autopsies for the county on contract .
Compared with its more violent neighbors — Newark , to the north , and Atlantic City , to the south — the central New Jersey shore tends to generate uncomplicated deaths : heart disease , liver failure , sunstroke .
Zadroga ’s death , at the age of thirty - four , was different .
Medical records showed that his health had been failing for almost five years , apparently owing to degenerative lung problems , which had forced him to go on sick leave from his job as a New York City homicide detective in 2002 .
He had spent the last year of his life dependent on a portable oxygen tank .
After Zadroga died , on January 5 , 2006 , his father , Joe , requested an autopsy .

At the morgue , Breton surveyed the body .
He noted two small bruises on the chin and a pair of faint scars on the abdomen — from stab wounds , he speculated — along with several tattoos .
Cutting inward from the armpits to the pubic bone , he folded back the muscle and removed the rib cage with a saw .
Six feet tall and weighing two hundred and sixteen pounds , Zadroga was solidly built , despite losing weight rapidly in the final months of his life .
Even so , Breton recalls being struck by the size of Zadroga ’s lungs , which had a reddish , meaty appearance , and were unusually firm to the touch .
“ Normally , the lungs feel soft and spongy , ” he said .
Lifting the lungs onto a scale , he also found that they were exceptionally heavy — almost three times the usual weight .
A dissection revealed the cause .
Zadroga ’s lungs contained a vast number of foreign - body granulomas : knots of scar tissue that build up around inorganic particles , like the pearling around sand grains in an oyster .
The scarring was so extensive and severe that the right ventricle of Zadroga ’s heart had thickened from the strain of trying to force blood through the ravaged vessels and capillaries .
“ It ’s not unusual to find a few granulomas in a lung , ” Breton noted later .
“ But usually this is something you see here and there . ”
The granulomas in Zadroga ’s lungs were all over .
Breton could n’t identify the gritty particles lodged in the tissue with his microscope , though he remembers thinking that some of them looked “ dustlike . ”
He sent a sample to the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology , which identified the foreign material as a combination of talc , cellulose , calcium phosphate , and methacrylate plastic .
Breton also spoke to Joe Zadroga , who said that his son ’s health had begun to deteriorate in the weeks following the World Trade Center attacks .
Shortly after joining the recovery effort at Ground Zero , Joe said , James had developed a persistent cough .
After talking with Joe , Breton had little doubt about the underlying source of Zadroga ’s lung trouble .
In his final report , he concluded that James Zadroga had died from respiratory failure due to severe panlobar granulomatous pneumonitis .
He added that he felt “ with a reasonable degree of medical certainty that the cause of death in this case was directly related to the 9/11 incident . ”
News of the diagnosis spread quickly .
The hazy air in which rescue teams worked was already suspected of contributing to everything from chronic coughs to cancer , and Zadroga ’s death was widely seen as the harbinger of an epidemic .
A few weeks later , the senators for New York and New Jersey — Charles Schumer , Hillary Clinton , Robert Menendez , and Frank Lautenberg — wrote to George Pataki , who was then the governor of New York , urging him to extend the list of 9/11 victims , and to compensate the families of first responders who became chronically ill after working at Ground Zero .
The letter called attention to the predicament of Zadroga ’s four - year - old daughter , Tyler Ann , now orphaned — Zadroga ’s wife , Ronda , had died the previous year — and in the care of her father ’s parents .
“ Detective Zadroga served with great courage in the line of duty and paid the ultimate sacrifice for his heroism , ” the senators wrote , adding that his death “ will not be the last to be suffered by the brave Americans who rushed to Ground Zero in the hours and days after September 11 . ”
The so - called Zadroga Act , which Pataki signed in August , 2006 , provided generous benefits to the families of city workers who died of 9/11 - related illnesses .
Tyler
Ann became one of the first recipients .
But there were other complications to come .
In order for Zadroga ’s name to be added to the official victims ’ list — and , ultimately , engraved on the National September 11 Memorial — his status as a casualty of 9/11 had to be verified .
In the summer of 2007 , copies of Zadroga ’s autopsy report and medical history ( and , later , slides of tissue taken from his lungs ) were sent to the Chief Medical Examiner of New York City , Dr. Charles Hirsch .
In October , he returned his verdict .
Calling his assessment “ markedly different ” from Breton ’s , Hirsch disputed the claim that the talc and the cellulose found in Zadroga ’s lungs came from Ground Zero .
Instead , he said , the embedded material was pharmaceutical debris produced by injecting a solution of crushed prescription pills .
The news provoked an uproar .
The Daily News ran an editorial accusing Hirsch of “ smearing ” Zadroga ’s reputation .
The president of New York ’s Detectives ’ Endowment Association suggested that the city was trying to arm itself against pending class - action suits from Ground Zero workers .
A congressional delegation demanded that an independent panel be established to investigate all deaths connected to dust exposure at the 9/11 sites .
“ The history of 9/11 should not be decided behind closed doors by one person , ” Carolyn Maloney , a New York congresswoman , announced .
Michael Moore took up the cause on his Web site .
At a conference a few days later , Joe Zadroga appeared with Michael Baden , a celebrity forensic pathologist who had used one of Zadroga ’s lung - tissue slides for a segment on 9/11 - related illness in his HBO series , “ Autopsy : Postmortem with Dr. Baden . ”
Baden , a former Chief Medical Examiner of New York City who is now the forensic pathologist for the New York State Police , announced that he had reviewed the evidence and had no doubt that James Zadroga had died as a result of exposure to toxic dust at Ground Zero .
There was no sign of any drug addiction , Baden said .
“ You could see glass fibres in there .
You do n’t get that from injecting drugs . ”
In the months since the announcement , Baden has not changed his view .
Discussing the case with me in his apartment , eighteen floors above the Museum of Modern Art , he acknowledged that granulomas can result from injecting ground - up medication — as happens when heroin users inject a solution of crushed methadone tablets — but disputed the idea that the wreckage in Zadroga ’s lungs could have been caused by shooting up .
“ People who have chronic lung disease from drug abuse have long histories of drug abuse , rehabilitation , doctors going in and out , ” he said .
“ You ca n’t hide that sort of drug abuse . ”
He had noted earlier that Breton had observed no needle scars on Zadroga ’s arms .
“ If I saw needle - track scars , that would make me think right away : intravenous abuse . ”
Baden would not speculate on what lay behind Hirsch ’s finding , though he wondered whether the case had involved something political .
Either way , he said , he found the assessment baffling .
“ I think that Dr. Hirsch seems to have been misled by the fact of finding talc and cellulose , which can be found in people who grind down drugs that are meant for oral consumption .
But they can occur in other ways . ”
He said that he considered the assessment not only medically wrong but also “ nasty ” — a mean - spirited swipe at a guy “ who was at Ground Zero , who really worked hard on the pile . ”
The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner has the unrenovated pallor of a forgotten city agency .
Dimmed by a concrete overbite , the street entrance manages to look at once ominous and shabby — a homely approach to an agency that houses one of the largest and busiest forensic labs in the country .
Even by the standards of other big cities , New York has a prolific capacity to produce dead bodies , and , as Chief Medical Examiner , Charles Hirsch is responsible for the processing of some twenty - five thousand fatalities a year — nearly half the city ’s annual total .
Roughly fifty - five hundred of those cases require autopsy , including all deaths that are violent , sudden , mysterious , or in some way related to public or consumer safety — an infant asphyxiated by a car seat , say , or a runner who died from applying too much topical muscle cream .
Hirsch ’s role is covertly powerful .
Medical examiners are frequently required to testify in criminal cases , and in the past few years he has overseen the investigation of several high - profile fatalities , including the sudden death of Heath Ledger and the fatal child abuse of Nixzmary Brown .
Being the final medical authority in such cases — particularly those involving police brutality or city negligence — can be politically fraught , and , in New York , administrative infighting and sheer population density combine to create a singular institutional challenge .
For someone occupying such a controversial position , Hirsch has managed to remain unusually invisible — in part because , unlike many medical examiners , he rarely speaks with the press .
In the course of his nineteen - year tenure , he has never been interviewed on television , and has hardly ever been quoted in print .
Jonathan Hayes , a senior medical examiner who has worked in the office since 1990 , told me that one of Hirsch ’s maxims is “ Medical examiners get into trouble by saying too much , too soon , or to the wrong person . ”
Privacy , however , can also create problems .
By refusing to detail the evidence supporting his interpretation of Zadroga ’s death , Hirsch appeared secretive , fostering suspicions about his motives and the validity of his verdict .
Policemen in particular felt betrayed .
Barbara Butcher , who coördinates crime - scene investigations between Hirsch ’s agency and the Police Department , said , “ There are cops I ’ve known for years who would n’t talk to me about it . ”
When I visited Hirsch recently , he had , as usual , been in his office since seven in the morning .
( His departures are less consistent .
He lives with his wife just a few blocks north of the office , and Hayes told me , “ I ’ve looked up from bodies and seen Dr. Hirsch standing there at three in the morning . ” )
Hirsch is seventy - one years old .
Courteous and mannerly , he walks with a slight forward cant — the lingering effect of an operation to repair a herniated disk .
Although his face is lean , the cheeks are rosy , with large ears and dark eyebrows framing a nose that is slightly off center .
Before coming to New York , Hirsch went to school in Chicago and worked in Cleveland , and his habits still reflect Midwestern tastes : sober suits worn with narrow suspenders , and , for pleasure , a pipe of Captain Black tobacco .
When making a point , he occasionally taps one finger lightly on the desktop .
His speech is so soft that one has to strain to hear it .
At an afternoon meeting , conducted with ten of the agency ’s thirty forensic pathologists , Hirsch received brisk updates on a dozen ongoing investigations , including the apparent suicide of an eighty - year - old man , and the autopsy of a woman who was found mummified in her apartment wearing nothing but a sweater .
Hirsch listened to these recitations quietly , removing and folding his glasses with care .
Dissatisfied with the evidence presented in the suicide , he asked about the meaning of a note found on the man ’s kitchen table , which was addressed to relatives in Eastern Europe and ended , simply , “ Farewell . ”
“ Someday , son , a giant conglomerate will find a way to harness the moonlight and make us pay for it . ”

Shopping
“ Was the letter dated ? ” he asked .
“ Do you know how long it was sitting there ? ”
He also lingered on the mostly full bottles of prescription medication that were found in the room .
“ People who want to kill themselves tend to empty every bottle , ” he noted .
A discussion ensued .
A medical examiner pointed out that the only empty bottle recovered from the scene contained Ambien , a sleep aid — but that the toxicology panel had found no traces of Ambien in the body .
The bathroom cabinet contained an unfamiliar antibiotic , possibly bought in Eastern Europe , and not listed in any of the standard pharmaceutical resources .
Hirsch listened politely until the conversation ended .
Then he turned to address the medical examiner in charge of the case .
“ The note is n’t compelling , and the toxicology is borderline at best , ” he said quietly .
“ If you ’re going to conclude that this is an intentional self - destruction by medication , you ’re going to have to prove it . ”
Hirsch is known for his willingness to challenge seemingly obvious conclusions , a tendency that , in politically charged cases , has often made him unpopular .
In 1989 , a twenty - five - year - old black man named Richard Luke died in police custody after being physically restrained by the arresting officers .
Although the medical examiner ’s office confirmed extensive bruising , Hirsch ruled that Luke died not as a result of police brutality but from acute cocaine intoxication — a verdict that prompted street protests .
Hirsch insists that he has been unaffected by the excoriation following his findings on the Zadroga case but noted that he had received requests from several senators urging him to change his assessment .
“ It ’s the only instance in which political pressure has been exerted on me , ” he remarked tartly .
Since the controversy , Hirsch has revealed little about the evidence in the case , but when we spoke he stressed the fact that the granulomas in Zadroga ’s lungs were concentrated in the arteries and not in the alveoli .
Drug users who inject crushed pills routinely develop granulomas , because insoluble fillers used to bind a pill ’s active ingredient do n’t get digested — as they would if a pill was swallowed — and , instead , circulate through the bloodstream , eventually lodging in the narrow pulmonary arteries .
The condition is well known and is sometimes referred to as “ mainliner ’s lung . ”
When I spoke to Michael Baden , he argued that Zadroga ’s lungs were in such bad shape that it was impossible to tell where the damage had originated .
Hirsch disagreed .
Crystals lodged in the pulmonary arteries can sometimes get pushed into the alveoli , he observed , because of the constant pressure of surging blood , but the same force does not exist in reverse .
Therefore , the matter in Zadroga ’s pulmonary arteries must have entered his lungs through the bloodstream , not through inhalation .
The type of material found in Zadroga ’s lungs was also significant .
Talc and cellulose are widely used pharmaceutical ingredients , Hirsch noted , but neither was considered a major respiratory hazard at Ground Zero : talc because it was n’t found in the air in abundance ; cellulose because it is not considered particularly hazardous .
( The molecules are too large to pass through the elaborate filtering apparatus of the upper airway . )
The absence of needle marks Hirsch deemed insignificant , because clean needles cause less scarring .
Talking about the case later , Jonathan Hayes remarked that one of the dangers of forensic pathology , particularly in dramatic cases , is that people see what they expect to see .
“ I think there ’s a possibility that that ’s what happened here , ” he said .
“ This guy ’s been down in the World Trade Center , spent hours after hours on the pile .
You look at his lungs : oh , they ’re full of scar tissue and inflammation ! ”
He went on , “ As Dr. Hirsch would say , ‘ Sometimes it ’s necessary to slay a beautiful theory with an ugly fact . ’ ”
Interestingly , Hirsch was himself exposed to the miasma of debris created during the 9/11 attacks .
Early that morning , he rounded up a small crew of examiners and drove to the base of the burning towers to scout sites for a temporary morgue .
With an investigator named Diane Crisci , he walked south along the West Side Highway and had just reached the pedestrian walkway connecting the World Trade Center to the Winter Garden when the south tower collapsed .
The blast threw Hirsch underneath the walkway , where he was battered by flying rubble but sheltered from the worst of the falling debris .
When he opened his eyes , Hirsch recalled , the air was so black that he could n’t tell whether he was on the surface or buried .
He spat out the dust and located Crisci .
Together , the pair hobbled away from the devastation —
Hirsch with a sprained ankle and a gashed wrist , Crisci disabled by a broken leg .
Hirsch arranged medical care for Crisci , then hitched a ride back to the office , his arm still bloody and his clothes covered in dust .
When I asked Hirsch whether he had experienced any symptoms from this exposure , he was emphatic that he had not .
When I persisted — did he , at least , worry about the long - term effects ?
—he grew terse .
“ There ’s no point in worrying about things that you ca n’t control , ” he said .
For professional reasons , Hirsch said , he continues to follow the epidemiological research , particularly a recent study that showed a statistical increase in sarcoidosis — an inflammatory disorder that attacks the lungs and other organs — among firefighters who worked at Ground Zero when the smoke was thickest .
Last May , the weight of this study persuaded him to revise his opinion of five years earlier on the death of Felicia Dunn - Jones , a forty - two - year - old lawyer who died five months after being trapped in the initial explosive plume .
In his review , Hirsch noted that , while the sarcoidosis that killed Dunn - Jones may have been present before 9/11 , the illness had almost certainly been exacerbated by the particulate - laden air she inhaled on the morning the towers fell .
The ruling made Dunn - Jones the first dust casualty to be entered on the official list of 9/11 victims .
It also prompted a number of other families to resubmit cases that had been closed .
Each of these claims will be examined , Hirsch told me , and as more information becomes available some deaths may eventually be reclassified .
But the results may be slow in coming .
Hirsch said that he ’d had letters from survivors who had developed cancers of one form or another , and that he could only reply that the scientific evidence is n’t there yet .
“ It ’s going to take a lot of epidemiologic investigation , ” he said .
This attitude of scientific caution is not always welcomed by those who have lost a loved one to degenerative illness .
“ I would never misrepresent the reality that there are people who are terribly unhappy with us , ” Hirsch acknowledged .
“ I sometimes have to tell the family , ‘ You know what ’s in your heart .
I have to go with the evidence . ’ ”
As difficult as such conversations are , he believes that truth ultimately allows the living to come to terms with the dead .
In a lecture that he gave in 1997 , Hirsch discussed the medical examiner ’s “ sacred responsibility ” to talk to the bereaved .
“ None of us lives comfortably with uncertainty , ” he observed .
“ Once they know and understand the facts , even if unpleasant , most people have the ability to make their peace with reality . ”
One Sunday in early March , I drove down to Little Egg Harbor , two hours south of New York City , to see Joe and Linda Zadroga .
It was a cold day , with a brisk wind that whipped sand up from the roadsides and drove it against the sides of saltbox houses and trailered boats .
Anchoring the tip of a small cul - de-sac , the Zadroga house , with an observatory window and wide , steeply raked front steps , is so much larger than its neighbors that at first I mistook it for a church .
In the driveway , a pair of vintage cars sat covered next to a silver Ford pickup whose rear window had been transformed into a memorial : the World Trade Center towers framed by an American flag , and the legend “ James Zadroga , Detective NYPD .
Gone but not Forgotten .
Fidelis ad Mortem . ”
Joe greeted me at the door .
A former cop , like his son —he was the chief of police in North Arlington — he is stocky , with a bullish neck and shoulders and expressive hooded eyes .
His wife , Linda , a petite woman with a deep tan , seemed tiny next to him .
She wore a bright - pink sweatsuit and a silver heart - shaped pendant with a photograph of her son , inscribed “ Jimmy . ”
Sitting in the breakfast room , which overlooks a stretch of silvery shoreline , Joe talked about nearby Atlantic City ( “ She goes sometimes .
I do n’t ” ) , and bowed his head when Linda groused about his attachment to old T - shirts ( “ He holds on to everything ” ) .
Tyler
Ann wandered in — a wary six - year - old in pink camouflage pajamas — and fussed with Joe ’s chair before wandering out again .
When the conversation turned to James , Linda excused herself .
“ She do n’t like to talk about it , ” Joe said with a shrug .
Joe was just back from Washington , D.C. , where he had attended a rally in support of the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act , introduced by Representative Maloney .
Since his son ’s death , Joe has become a regular presence at such events ; last year he attended about one a month .
The attention that followed Breton ’s autopsy has added a disorienting public overlay to an otherwise private sorrow , and Joe seemed distinctly conscious of the symbolic pressure .
But he was less concerned with arguing the merits of 9/11 - related compensation claims than with affectionately recalling his son ’s good - old - boy ways .
He cheerfully described James as “ a partyer , ” who , during his days as a beat cop , would cadge meals from the Fire Department —
“ He always knew which firehouses had the best cooks ” — and who , assigned to work on street crime , had an intuitive ability to sense who in a crowd was concealing a gun .
There was a good - natured quality to this banter : a cop ’s - cop fondness , couched in jokey bravado .
“ That ’s his tough guy , ” Joe said , sifting through photographs of James that included one of him posing solemnly with a foot - long striper .
He lingered over a later shot , taken at the ceremony when James made detective .
In the picture , James stands with one arm around his wife , a pretty brunette with a shy smile .
Dark - haired and baby - faced , he is powerfully built — a younger version of his father .
He regards the camera with a lightly mocking pride .
RNC to Draft a Resolution Calling President Bush a Socialist
I have been here defending President Bush for almost two years through thick and thin .
During the whole amnesty for illegal immigrants fiasco I jumped ship , there was no defending such a deplorable bill .
But I came back , that is until the bailout fiasco .
That is when I left the president for good .
Perhaps I am not being fair to myself with that statement , I did not leave the president , he left me , or rather , my position on the government ’s role in the private sector .
I will not be defending him here any more .
He sold out the party and the country .
I have been condemning the bailout bill as socialization .
The government has nationalized ( taken over ) several industries in manner that would make Hugo Chavez proud .
So proud in fact that Chavez mocked the president for finally realizing that socialism is the wave of the future .
Talk about embarrassing !
Now the RNC is drafting a resolution to condemn the bailout bill and also calling President Bush a socialist , as well as congressional Republicans who also went along with this foolhardy bailout bill .
The RNC is using this issue to try to reconnect with their core voters , people like me who are totally upset and disgusted with the actions of the president and the party in regards to this bailout bill and nationalization of the economy , Wall Street , the mortgage industry , and most recently , the auto industry .
We ca n’t be a party of small government , free markets and low taxes while supporting bailouts and nationalizing industries , which lead to big government , socialism and high taxes at the expense of individual liberty and freedoms
Now that is music to my ears .
Let ’s just hope that the conservatives in the party are able to retake the leadership positions on the party and restore Republicans as the party of limited government .
This is the issue that caused John McCain to lost the election .
After running as the candidate who would cut spending and oppose earmarks he ran to Washington to sign the pork filled , spend - a- holic bailout bill portraying himself as the opposite of who he was running as .
Republicans who felt that a conservative could n’t win in the current political environment nominated a RINO , a Democrat lite , and when voters are faced with voting for a Democrat - lite or the real deal , they will choose the real deal .
Hopefully Republican leaders are now realizing this and are in the process of becoming the party of conservatism once again .
If enacted , the resolution would put the party on record opposing the $ 700 billion bailout of the financial sector , which passed Congress with Republican support and was signed by Mr. Bush , and opposing the bailout of the auto industry
This is a winning position with voters across the board and on both sides of the aisle .
Something like 75 % of all voters think that the bailout bill is wrong .
The RNC can hope to capitalize on this by taking the position that a true conservative would have had in the first place .
In fairness to congressional Republicans , they did oppose bailing out the auto industry but they were overruled , or should I say , undermined , by the president .
The RNC realizes that this whole issue was the final undoing of the Republican chances of winning the White House and now they are positioning themselves for the 2010 election .
The RNC resolution will also condemn president - elect Obama ’s new New Deal .
The resolution also opposes President - elect Obama ’s proposed public works program and supports conservative alternatives , ” while encouraging the RNC “ to engage in vigorous public policy debates consistent with our party platform
While president - elect Obama has a plan to further the socialization of America it is important that we never forget that the current path toward socialism was started by President Bush .
We must not forget it and the RNC must not forget it .
We cannot have another John McCain as our next nominee for president .
Hopefully the RNC is going to get us back on track and on the path of true conservatism , they are off to a promising start with this resolution .
It will be interesting to see if it goes anywhere .
Maybe conservatives have learned their lesson from the last election .
I hope so , time is running out , we need to take back our country from the socialists before it is too late .
If it is n’t already .
Here is the text of the resolution :
WHEREAS , the Bank Bailout Bill effectively nationalized the Nation ’s banking system , giving the United States non-voting warrants from participating financial institutions , and moving our free market based economy another dangerous step closer toward socialism ; and WHEREAS , what was needed , and is still needed , to fix the banking industry is not a bailout , but rather a commitment to fiscal responsibility .
Fiscal responsibility , that is the tune that rings true every time .
The RNC claims that they are ready for a fight on this issue , I hope that they are .
The Republican party is in disarray and looking for direction .
There is an internal battle in the party in terms of the direction the party should turn .
This is our chance for conservatives to take the party back .
We have to .
Mexicans Dying in Our Drug War
by Steven Greenhut by Steven Greenhut
When it comes to foreign affairs , Americans are used to debating progress or setbacks in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , or on the Israeli invasion last month of the Gaza Strip .
We ’re used to thinking about death and destruction thousands of miles from home and , as a result , tend to debate these matters based more on glancing impressions , quick reads of newspapers and Web sites and sound bites rather than personal knowledge or the knowledge of those who live in the countries at issue .
What if I mentioned that thousands of people have been killed — 7,337 at last count — since 2007 in open warfare just a short drive from here ?
Or that the grisly violence has reached close to areas within the readership of this newspaper ?
What if I noted that the violence has altered the lives of many of our neighbors , friends and co-workers , who have family members who dwell in the heart of the war zone ?
What if I added that , because of this war , we place our lives in jeopardy by simply visiting some of our favorite vacation spots ?
Would that cause you to think twice about your foreign - policy priorities ?
I am referring , of course , to Mexico , which has turned into a horror show in the past couple of years .
There ’s been sporadic news coverage of these events .
But the average American — and the average politician , for that matter — does n’t seem attuned or interested in a human tragedy that ’s starting to spill not just across the border , but deeply into the American interior , to cities such as Dallas , Atlanta and Sioux Falls , S.D. , where Mexican drug gangs have murdered and abducted people .

Clone abusing ninja Naruto has been spotted lending his support to Indonesia ’s Prosperous Justice Party , or Partai Keadilan Sejahtera , an Islamist party supporting such backwards medievalist policies as bans on pornography , in what we can only consider as an episode which could damage his chances of becoming Hokage .
The party in question supports legislation such as the laughably titled “ Bill Against Pornography and Pornoaction “ , a bill which sought to ban such insidious evils as public kissing , bikinis and navel exposure ( “ pornoaction ” ) , and of course pornography .
The party itself claims it is against the imposition of Sharia codes , although it is doubtful anyone believes them .
In fact , a vague but complete ban on pornography was passed in 2008 , with downloading lewd materials in Indonesia now carrying a possible 4 year sentence ; a “ sexually suggestive performance ” can attract a 12 - year sentence .
Naturally , freedom loving Islamists were behind this .
It is not clear whether the image in question is an authorised use of Naruto ’s likeness ; it seems overwhelmingly unlikely to be the case .
It also seems unlikely that Naruto presents a good match with the party ’s unstated objectives of rendering the masses obedient slaves of God .

Now , a threat to malting barley has created a new call for support as the price and availability of beer is being threatened by climate change according to a study conducted and released in 2008 .
[ social_buttons ]
The potential for the alcohol industry to be effected by climate change has been a concern for some time , but it is hitting a feverish pitch and garnering support and calls to action from campuses across the country .
In Lawrence , Kansas , Greenpeace volunteers held a recruitment event called “ Save the Ales ” earlier this week to tackle how global warming effects college drinking .
“ It ’s not really about the beer , ” John Gawin , Greenpeace intern , said .
“ It just shows you how climate change can effect even small things . ”
The concepts of global warming and climate change have been well documented and embraced by politicians and mainstream media for quite some time now , save a few reluctant to see the truth .
While the general public is aware that there is a problem , it is often difficult for many to grasp it on a personal level .
We see how it is reported , but it sometimes takes a direct effect on the “ simple things ” in life to make it tangible .
In college , beer is real .
The study conducted in 2008 reveals a trend towards drastically increasing prices of the materials used to create beer that is a direct result of global warming .
Jim Salinger , a climate scientist at New Zealand ’s National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research , claims that if changes are n’t made soon , beer could become scarce .
“ It will mean either there will be pubs without beer or the cost of beer will go up , ” Salinger told the Institute of Brewing and Distilling convention .
For college students , even those who are n’t activists , this could be the last straw that brings them to the fight .

Catholic bishops , specifically , also have a responsibility to teach the faith , and our beliefs about marriage and family are part of this faith . ” and …
“ Members of churches who supported Proposition 8 sincerely believe that defining marriage as only between a man and a woman is one such issue .
They see marriage and the family as the basic building blocks of human society , existing before government and not created by it .
Marriage is for us the ideal relationship between a man and woman , in which , through their unique sexual complementarity , the spouses offer themselves to God as co-creators of new human persons , a father and mother giving them life and enabling them to thrive in the family setting . ”
Bill May , Chairman for Catholics for the Common Good , who played a crucial role in getting Catholics behind Proposition 8 , supported the Archbishop ’s statement , which described “ strong and legitimate reasons for supporting marriage between a man and a woman . ”
May also went on to say that Niederauer “ is a very loving person , ” and “ he expresses the teachings of the church in a very pastoral way .
He is expressing the fundamental understanding of the Catholic Church that every human person has intrinsic dignity that must be respected . ”
Except of course , when it comes to the intrinsic dignity and respect same - sex couples deserve .
Archbishop Niederauer who previously served as a Bishop in Salt Lake City , actively recruited the Mormon church to get involved in supporting Proposition 8 which would not have passed without their help .
In the video below the Archbishop enlightens us on the importance of marriage between one man , and one woman .

At RubyFringe last July , Giles Bowkett gave a presentation that , afterwards , rapidly became the talk of the internet .
‘ He had 900 slides , ’ they said .
‘ He wrote a program that composes music , ’ they whispered .
‘ He went 2 hours over , but the whole crowd still stuck around to listen . ’
The video of the talk recently popped up on InfoQ and if you watch it , as I recently did , you ’ll find that though , as usual , some of the chatter was exaggerated it really is a rip-roarer .
Giles weaves between relating hi-jinx from his , um , colorful life , saying inspiring things about programming as art and individual creative liberation , and demoing this really cool piece of Ruby for generating MIDI .
Arc - a - what - a- who ?
The missing link ?
How you play drums in Reason .
It ’s the last of those that I want to talk to you about today .
Giles ’s MIDI generator is called Archaeopteryx and is — in addition to suprisingly hard to spell — a probabilistic step sequencer .
What ’s “ a probabilistic step sequencer ” ?
Not an unreasonable question .
A sequencer is simply a bit of software that tells the computer when to play certain bits of music , usually via MIDI .
A step sequencer , then , is a particular flavor of sequencer that breaks music down into its individual beats ( called steps ) and allows you to set the status of each one separately .
A canonical example is the ReDrum drum sequencer in Reason .
The sixteen square buttons across the bottom each correspond to one sixteenth note of the bar .
For each drum ( represented by the 10 channel strips that make up most of the instrument ) , you can turn each of those 16 lights on and off to indicate whether the drum should be played on that particular beat .
Interfaces like this , in both hardware and soft , are how people “ program ” drum beats .
So , finally , what about the probabilistic part ?
Well , this is where things get interesting .
As opposed to ReDrum , where you definitively turn each beat of each drum on or off , Archaeopteryx lets you add the element of chance .
Instead of just turning each 16th note on or off , you define a probability between 0 ( never play ) and 1 ( always play ) and , on each pass through the bar , Arx rolls the metaphorical dice to decide whether or not that note gets played .
The result , when programmed correctly , can sound like intentional musical variations on an ongoing pattern or theme .
And if you use the MIDI that Arx generates to trigger the kinds of sounds that make up dance music , you ’ve got yourself an AI DJ , which is largely how Giles uses it .
Hardware ?
Hardware !
As the guy with the snare drum - playing robot ( also here ) , this is where I start feeling a certain twitch .
That twitch goes in two directions .
Today , I ’m going to talk about the In .
I ’ve built the first proof of concept for a hardware controller for Archaeopteryx .
The rest of this post will be spent explaining how it works and talking about some of the repercussions and areas for future research .
Archaeopteryx is designed for live DJing .
It ’s organized around the principle that the music can never stop and that all changes you make to it should happen in an orderly , musical fashion .
For example , when you edit the files that specify the probabilities for your various MIDI channels , Arx polls your files in sync with the tempo of the music you ’re playing and only makes changes at the end of every four measures .
The only downside to Arx as a tool for performing music is that you freaking change the music by editing floating point numbers in arrays in a text file !
Needless to say , that is not necessarily the most optimal interface for fluent musical performance .
Most musician types like actual physical objects that they can lay their hands on understand with their spatial intuition .
Hence , a hardware controller .
What would controlling Arx from hardware mean ?
Well , at the most primitive level , it would mean setting Arx ’s probabilities by manipulating some object in the physical world .
I started with a basic knob .
The knob , or more formally , ‘ audio taper potentiometer ’ , is the classic first analog input in physical computing .
You plug one of its three leads into ground , one into 5 volts , and the third one into one of the Arduino ‘s analog input pins , and you ’re good to go .
Once I had the knob plugged in , I wrote a simple program for the Arduino using RAD .
The first iteration of the program simply sent the values of the knob back to my computer over serial .
I connected to the serial port with screen and watched the numbers twitch .
After some observation , I learned that the knobs output values varied from 925 to 1023 .
I also learned that there was enough jitter that I ’d have to introduce a ‘ handshake ’ to smooth things out .
A ‘ handshake ’ is a classic technique for getting two devices to communicate with each other smoothly over something like a serial line .
The problem is that the output device ( the Arduino ) may send data faster than the input device ( my Mac ) can consume it , leading to jitter as some of the intermediary readings are lost .
The solution is to let the input device drive the communication .
You setup the output device to “ only speak when spoken to , ” i.e. to only send data when it receives data .
Then you have the input device send a bit out every time it ’s ready for new data .
The result is a smooth conversation .
Taking the handshake into account , here ’s the code I came up with for programming the Arduino :
The only possibly surprising bit is the “ serial_read ” at the end , but that ’s just a way of having the Arduino clear the serial buffer so that it ’s ready when the computer next tries to communicate with it .
Once I ’d gotten the values of the knob into the computer , then what ?
How did I get it to actually control Arx ’s probabilities ?
Well , as I mentioned earlier , Arx uses a series of Ruby programs to sequence its instruments .
Here ’s a fragment of an example file that ships with Arx , db_drum_definition.rb :
There they are , the probabilities , right there !
Since this was just a proof of concept , I decided to do the most primitive thing possible : just scale the value coming off the knob into a percentage and set that percentage as the probability for every step of ten MIDI channels — enough to control that whole ReDrum drum kit we looked at earlier .
It would be : The Crazy Knob .
When turned all the way to the left , Arx would never play , and when turned all the way to the right it would play all ten drums on every sixteenth note .
In between it would play random combinations of note with increasing franticness .
And , since this is just a proof of concept , I also decided to go with the simplest delivery method for the data I possibly could : simply modifying the db_drum_definition.rb file in place as if I had edited it by hand .
I ’m sure there ’s a more sophisticated way to do control Arx using some for of it ’s public API , but this was the simplest and most brutally effective thing I could think of .
I even packaged the whole templating process up in a nice little wrapper I ’m calling Templarx so that its hideous guts would be hidden ( Templarx is on the GitHub if you want to drop in and make some improvements ) .
Once that was done , I just had to write a Ruby script that would read the serial data coming in from the Arduino , scale the results into a Float probability , and then call Templarx to re-write Arx ’s drum definition file .
The result looks a lot like this :
Despite being a little ugly because of how much boilerplate is required to startup a connection with ruby / serialport , this code is pretty straightforward .
The only surprising bit is the “ sleep 10 ” , which I had to add because of a detail about the Arduino hardware .
The Arduino uses serial over USB to program the device as well as to communicate with the external computer .
When you first make a serial connection to the Arduino it goes into a special mode where it waits to see if you ’re going to send it data or tell it to reprogram itself .
The “ sleep 10 ” is there to give it sufficient time to exit this mode and be ready to listen for normal serial communication .
The rest of the code is simply the computer ’s side of the handshake and scaling operations described above along with the call to Templarx to write the new probabilities out to the drum definition file where Arx will pick them up on its next cycle .
And …TADA !
That ’s it .
You start up the Ruby program , wait 10 seconds , and start turning the knob .
All the way left for quiet .
All the way right for max crazy .
For maximum results , follow Giles instructions on how to get Arx to drive Reason , plug Arx ’s MIDI into ReDrum , and start twiddling the knob .
Or , you can watch me screencast here demoing the results of doing just that :
Ruby Arduino contolling Archaeopteryx from Greg Borenstein on Vimeo .
What ’s next ?
Well , besides the Out part of the equation ( using Arx ’s MIDI to control physical hardware ) , I ’ve also started working on some sketches towards a complete hardware controller for Arx .
I ’m imagining 16 Spectra Symbol Soft Pots to control the probabilities and a selector for which MIDI channel you ’d like to control .
I do n’t know why , but for some reason I picture this project using the awesome old school 7 - segment LEDs rather than anything fancy like LCDs .
If you ’re a DJ type , or anyone else who ’s interested in using Arx in performance — or , better , has already done so — I ’d love to hear your thoughts about this design : how it would work for you , what could make it better , what other features it might need , etc .
On the Arduino / physical computing side , I hope this kind of project can be inspiring for beginners .
I think it shows how much of a cool effect you can get with even the simplest of introductory circuits if you glue together the right pieces of software to do cool things .
One final piece of awesomeness worth relating is that , while I was working on this , I described it to my friend Devin and he went ahead and used Templarx to whip together an Archaeopteryx controller in Shoes , the amazing minimal cross-platform Ruby GUI toolkit .

Are you short of money this month ?
You can borrow money directly by taking out a flash loan in Belgium on the internet , without any hassle !
It is a common problem , you suddenly have to deal with expenses , while at the moment you do not have the money for that .
The bills must be paid and you must also be able to live normally .
These kinds of situations can cause considerable stress .
Especially for those who do not qualify for a loan from the bank , because they have received a blacklist registration .
Is there another way to get money quickly ?
Yes , you can now take out a flash loan in Belgium on the internet !
Check us out fast if you want to get a payday loan with bad credit
Taking out a loan on the internet has many advantages .
This way of borrowing is an ideal solution when you are tired of waiting for all kinds of checks and piles of paperwork through to dig through .
This is because borrowing via the internet is arranged in such a way that you do not have to send papers or answer difficult questions .
That way borrowing is easier than ever and you can also arrange this directly !
You make a loan application for a payday loan with bad credit online at https://www.paydaychampion.com/ in 5 minutes .
In many cases , you can have money the same day !
Borrowing without conditions with a flash loan in Belgium
Making borrowing through the internet so suitable if you want to get money quickly is that these loans do not have as many conditions attached as loans you take out with the bank .
For example , you only have to meet two requirements to get money via an online loan : you must be over 21 years of age and have a fixed income .
It does not matter what your income consists of .
As a result , lending with a benefit is also possible , you can borrow if you do not have a pay slip and you can still take out a loan if you are listed on the blacklist of the National Bank .
In short , almost everyone is able to take out a loan through the internet and so still get money today !
How much can I borrow with a flash loan in Belgium ?
There is of course also a disadvantage of loans that you take out on the internet .
The disadvantage is that you can not borrow large amounts .
Only small amounts up to a maximum of 1000 euros are possible .
You determine the amount of your loan yourself so that you can tailor it exactly to what you need .
Do you want to order a new laptop of 600 euro via internet ?
Which can !
But you can also book a holiday for 450 or borrow the full 1000 euros for repaying old debts .
What you do with the money you can decide for yourself and you do not have to inform the loan provider of this !
Are you looking for an easy loan , because you can use a bonus this month or because you suddenly have to pay all kinds of bills ?
You can arrange this online without having to leave the house with a flash loan Belgium !
Each of these institutions comes with certain rules and obligations that tell us how to do what we ’re supposed to do .
Journalism imposes habits that help reporters keep a mental distance from those they cover .
Scientists have obligations to the community of researchers .
In the process of absorbing the rules of the institutions we inhabit , we become who we are .
New generations do n’t invent institutional practices .
These practices are passed down and evolve .
So the institutionalist has a deep reverence for those who came before and built up the rules that he has temporarily taken delivery of .
“ In taking delivery , ” Heclo writes , “ institutionalists see themselves as debtors who owe something , not creditors to whom something is owed . ”
Image David Brooks
The rules of a profession or an institution are not like traffic regulations .
They are deeply woven into the identity of the people who practice them .
A teacher ’s relationship to the craft of teaching , an athlete ’s relationship to her sport , a farmer ’s relation to her land is not an individual choice that can be easily reversed when psychic losses exceed psychic profits .
Her social function defines who she is .
The connection is more like a covenant .
There will be many long periods when you put more into your institutions than you get out .
In 2005 , Ryne Sandberg was inducted into the baseball Hall of Fame .
Heclo cites his speech as an example of how people talk when they are defined by their devotion to an institution :
“ I was in awe every time I walked onto the field .
That ’s respect .
I was taught you never , ever disrespect your opponents or your teammates or your organization or your manager and never , ever your uniform .
You make a great play , act like you ’ve done it before ; get a big hit , look for the third base coach and get ready to run the bases . ”
This is an updated version of a story first posted at 11:27 a.m .
Flint , Michigan -- The Don is gone .
Mayor Don Williamson announced today that he is " retiring , " finally putting to rest weeks of speculation .
In an 11:20 a.m. news conference , Williamson cited health reasons for leaving office .
His resignation is effective midnight Sunday .
He took no questions from the media , and read from a prepared statement .
" Last month , I celebrated my third sinus infection in 13 months and my eighth kidney stone since Nov. 1 .
My doctors have told me that I should think about relaxing my schedule and reducing the demands on my time , " said Williamson , 75 .
Williamson , a multi-millionaire , said his life has been blessed with financial and political success .
" In my political life , I received the greatest honor of all , the trust and respect that the voters of this great city placed in me when they elected me mayor in 2003 and then re-elected me in 2007 , " Williamson said .
Williamson praised new city administrator Mike Brown and deputy mayor Darryl Buchanan .
Buchanan was present at the news conference but Brown was not .

Brown becomes acting mayor when Williamson leaves office and will lead the city until after an August election .
Williamson said there will be a lot of work for Buchanan and Brown as the city tries to deal with a " financial crisis . "
" It has been a great pleasure and honor to serve the hometown where Patsy and I have lived our whole lives , " Williamson said .
Rumors for weeks had been swirling that Williamson -- whose larger - than - life and often confrontational personality won him many of his supporters and his enemies -- would resign as mayor ahead of the Feb. 24 recall election .

Williamson repeatedly , and adamantly , denied those rumors .
And , many were surprised by Williamson 's decision .
Genesee County Prosecutor David Leyton could only said " I 'm shocked " when told of Williamson 's resignation .
Genesee County Sheriff Robert Pickell said he was " absolutely shocked that the mayor resigned . "
He said , though , that the city is left in capable hands with the appointment of Mike Brown .
" And with Darryl Buchanan working with Mr. Brown , it will be a good team , " Pickell said .
Williamson last week dumped right - hand man Buchanan and hired Brown , who worked for the Genesee Regional Chamber of Commerce , as the new city administrator .
He also appointed a new interim police chief , John Keahey , who is the third person in less than a month to fill the post .
The mayor initially won a term as mayor in 2003 , and then was re-elected in 2007 in a close election against challenger Dayne Walling .
Since then , there 's been a string of bad news , including budget deficits , layoffs , controversy over a proposed drag strip and turmoil at City Hall .
Williamson has pointed to some successes in the city , including the revitalization of downtown and the new alternative energy plant .
Flint voters in 2002 recalled then - Mayor Woodrow Stanley -- an election that led to a state takeover .
A New York doctor wants his estranged wife to return the kidney he donated to her , and is suing her for $ 1.5 million in lieu of the organ .

Dr. Richard Batista donated a kidney to wife Dawnell Batista in 2001 in what he says was an effort to save both her life and the couple 's marriage .
The couple , who married in 1990 , had three daughters , but their relationship became strained when Dawnell began battling kidney failure .
She received two kidney transplants that failed before her husband found that he was a match .
Though the surgery was successful , in physical therapy , Dawnell started an affair with her therapist .
" I saved her life and then to be betrayed like this is unfathomable .
It 's incomprehensible , " says Batista .
Since July 2005 , the couple has been involved in a bitter divorce , and Batista says he only went public with his demand for kidney compensation because his wife has prevented him from seeing their children and he 's tired of negotiating with her .
Without her husband 's donation , Dawnell may have had a very difficult time getting a kidney transplant .
The chances of her husband being a match were 1 - in - 700,000 to start , and had she not been able to use his kidney she would have faced a long wait , as there are 6,748 people on the kidney waiting list in New York State , according to the New York Daily News .

If she actually could give the kidney back today , her chances of getting an organ transplant would be even worse .
A new study has found that older women have less access to kidney transplants than men .
Researchers found that while no gender disparity exists for younger women , the chances a woman will be referred to the kidney donor waiting list begin declining at 46 , with women aged 56 to 65 having 15 % less access to donor kidneys than men .
" In theory we are asking for the return of the kidney , " Dr. Batista 's lawyer told the New York Post .
" Of course he would n't really ask for that but the value of it . "
A medical expert estimated that $ 1.5 million was the value of the organ , but a divorce attorney not involved in the case doubts he will be awarded compensation for the organ .
" I 've been in this business over 40 years and I 've never heard of that , " said Seymour J. Reisman .
" It 's not marital property , not a marital asset you can put a price tag on . "

Make viewportForGeometry not take the current viewport into account .
Make sure window decorations are n't hidden under panels during placement .
Ensure windows fit in the work area when placing them by calling the window sizing validation function .
Ignore _NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN

Also treat utility , menu and toolbar windows as group transients .
Handle desktops a bit better .
We want to prevent focus for windows that are not on the current viewport .
active_window_changed only updates d-> active if decorations are present , so setting d-> active before creating decorations may lead to incorrect results .
Validate size before placing and make sure the size validation function only respects USPosition if the window fits on the work area .
After adding windows on startup , re-sync the internal stack order with X. Consume X key press event for arrow key presses in scale mode .
That makes sure that bindings of other plugins are not trigger accidentially .
The scenario for that is e.g .
Scale being bound to Ctrl + Shift + Up and some other binding being bound to Ctrl + Shift + Left / Right .

Iran ’s first satellite launch aboard a home - grown rocket last week has left observers puzzled over just how it was done .
Was the satellite launched by a feeble rocket pushed to its limits , or has Iran ’s secretive space programme managed to develop a far more powerful launch vehicle without anyone noticing ?
The answer will affect how soon the country might achieve its stated goal of sending humans into space .
Iran launched its satellite – called Omid , or “ Hope ” – on 2 February .
According to Iranian media , it is a 40 - centimetre cube weighing 25 - kilograms , and is equipped with radio transmitters .
Foreign tracking stations and amateur sky watchers have been following the craft ’s relatively low orbit , which is expected to decay over weeks or months due to atmospheric drag .
At first , it was thought that the launch vehicle , called Safir - 2 , was derived from relatively feeble missiles that burn ambient - temperature liquid fuel , which Iran was already known to have .

Two of these missiles stacked one on top of the other could boost a third , small , solid - fuel rocket that could take a lightweight payload like Omid to orbit .
Two stages
But evidence has begun to emerge that the rocket might be more powerful than this .
Amateur observers report that the last stage of the rocket , which is also in orbit , is much brighter than the satellite itself , suggesting it is too large to be the third stage of a relatively modest rocket .
Geoffrey Forden of MIT , who specialises in the analysis of foreign countries ’ launch capabilities , is one of those now mulling over whether the rocket had just two stages , with a second stage that was much more powerful than anything Iran was known to possess .
This would be possible using a cryogenic fuel system involving liquid oxygen .
If true , this would have important implications for Iran ’s ambition to launch astronauts into space , something Reza Taghipour , head of Iran ’s Aerospace Industries Organization , has said the country hopes to do before 2021 .
Suborbital flights
“ If they used three stages , there ’s no way they ’re going to be getting a man to space anytime soon , ” Forden says .
“ If it ’s two stages , then maybe they could have suborbital flights fairly soon . ”
Ongoing tracking of the final stage ’s orbit should help to provide an answer .
That ’s because the speed of the object ’s drop due to atmospheric drag will provide clues as to its size .
Either way , the launch has heightened concern among those nations that suspect Iran is trying to develop nuclear weapons .
Military concerns
A rocket that can put a few dozen kilograms in orbit can also deliver a few hundred kilograms – the mass of a nuclear warhead – as far as western Europe .
Iran says its satellite launch was for peaceful purposes .
“ It would be very difficult for the spacefaring nations to say that Iran does n’t have a sovereign right for space launch capabilities , ” says Joan Johnson - Freese of the US Naval War College in Newport , Rhode Island .
“ They have a very legitimate reason for wanting to be able to launch their own satellites for both economic and prestige reasons , but it also gives them an additional military capability , ” she told New Scientist .
“ The dual - use aspect really puts you in a dilemma . ”

IBM Building Energy - Efficient 20 Petaflop Computer
February 3rd , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
I have to admit , this news makes me drool a little bit .
The US government agreed today to buy two supercomputers from IBM — including one that will scale to 20 petaflops .
That ’s 10 times the performance of today ’s most powerful systems .
The Sequoia system will be 15 times faster than BlueGene / P , but will have the same carbon footprint and only a small increase in power consumption .
You may recall that Argonne National Laboratory ’s BlueGene / P , which makes 350 million calculations a second per watt , is the second most energy - efficient supercomputer in the world .
The Sequoia system will use 45nm processors with up to 16 cores per chip , and will have 1.6 petabytes of memory feeding its 1.6 million cores .
IBM and DOE engineers will begin work on Sequoia in 2011 , with an expected completion date sometime in 2012 .

Diets fail for a lot of reasons but one of the primary ones is simply hunger .
During a diet , hunger invariably goes up .
Some of this is for purely physiological reasons , some of it is for psychological reasons .
Not that there is really a difference in the two .
And along with all of the other difficulties , this can derail the diet .
So let ’s look at hunger .
What it is , what it represents .
And more importantly let me provide 9 ways to handle hunger on a diet .
What is Hunger ?
To say that human hunger is complicated is a vast understatement .
To cover it in detail would require a series of articles or perhaps an entire book .
Research continues to uncover numerous interacting and overlapping hormones ( such as leptin , ghrelin , peptide YY , GLP - 1 and others ) that monitor how much and what someone is eating ( along with their body weight ) and those all send a signal to the brain that drives a number of processes , not the least of which is hunger .
Now , it would be truly simple if that ’s all there was to it but humans also eat / get hungry for non-physiological reasons .
We get hungry out of boredom , because we are at a party and it ’s expected that we eat , because we just saw a commercial for some food we like and many others .
Simplistically , we might differentiate these different drivers of hunger into physiological and psychological factors although the distinction between the two is not only false but increasingly fuzzy .
Physiological drives can manifest themselves as “ psychological ” hunger and psychological factors can affect physiology .
However , even though the distinction is a false one , it is often useful practically to make that division and I ” ll be doing so through the rest of that article .
Sufficed to say that human hunger is exceedingly complicated and finding out ways to deal with hunger while dieting is a huge first step in making diets more effective .
And with that said , in no particular order of importance , here are 9 Ways to Handle Hunger on a Diet .
1 : Eat More Lean Protein
While dietitians continue to squabble over whether carbohydrates or fats are more filling in the short - term , the data is actually abundantly clear : protein beats them both out .
Increasing amounts of research has shown that both acutely and in the long - term , higher protein intakes help blunt hunger and can reduce food intake .
It also helps that , as long as you ’re dealing with sources of lean protein ( low - fat fish , skinless chicken , even low - fat red meat ) , it can be tough to get a lot of calories from protein in the first place .
I ’d also note that there are many other reasons to consume sufficient amounts of lean protein on a weight loss diet including blood glucose stability and sparing of muscle mass loss .
It ’s also worth mentioning that a lot of the benefits that are often attributed to ‘ low - carbohydrate ’ diets have more to do with the increased protein intake ; the benefits occur because they are ‘ high - protein ’ .
2. Eat Fruit
For odd reasons fruit has gotten a bad rap for dieting , at least in the athletic and bodybuilding subculture but little could be further from the truth .
One aspect of hunger has to do with the status of liver glycogen , when liver glycogen is emptied , a signal is sent to the brain that can stimulate hunger ; the corollary is that replenishing liver glycogen tends to make people feel fuller .
The fructose component of fruit works to refill liver glycogen and folks who include a moderate amount of fruit in their weight loss diets often report feeling much less hungry .
That ’s in addition to the other benefits of fruit ( fiber , nutrients ) .
Oh yeah , eat whole fruit , stay away from fruit juice .
One study found greater weight loss in dieters who consumed fruit compared to one that did n’t .
3. Eat More Fiber
No list of this sort would be complete without the mention of fiber .
Fiber can help with hunger in at least two ways .
The first is that the physical “ stretching ” of the stomach is one of many signals about how much food has been eaten ; when the stomach is physically stretched the brain thinks you ’re full .
High - fiber / high - volume foods ( e.g. foods that have a lot of volume for few calories ) accomplish that most effectively .
Additionally , fiber slows gastric emptying , the rate at which food leave the stomach .
By keeping foods in the stomach longer , a high - fiber intake keeps folks full longer .
Basically , mom was right , eat your vegetables and get plenty of fiber .
4. Eat Moderate Amounts of Dietary Fat
Ignoring the debate I mentioned above about carbs versus fat and hunger , the simple fact is that exceedingly low - fat diets tend to leave a lot of people hungry in both the short - and long - term .
Tying in with my comments about fiber in Number 3 , dietary fat also slows gastric emptying ( hence the aphorism that high - fat meals really stick to the ribs ) .
While dietary fat does little to blunt hunger in the short - term , moderate intakes tend to keep people fuller longer between meals since the meal sits in the stomach longer .
As well , exceedingly low - fat diets often taste like cardboard , tying into some of the comments I made initially about psychological effects of dieting ; people wo n’t follow a diet that does n’t taste good for very long .
Dietary fat gives food a certain mouth - feel and very low - fat diets remove that , leaving people dissatisfied .
The diet usually ends shortly after that .
Research has shown that moderate fat diets improve adherence to dieting and , with rare exceptions , I do n’t suggest taking dietary fat much lower than 20 - 25 % of total calories on a fat loss diet .
In some cases ( such as very low - carbohydrate diets ) , it may be higher than this .
5. Exercise
I ’m hesitant to mention exercise in this article simply because the response to it can vary drastically in terms of hunger control on a diet .
Doing the topic justice would take a complete article in and of itself but here I ’m going to give a quick overview .
Basically , through myriad overlapping mechanisms , exercise has the potential to increase hunger , decrease hunger or have no effect .
Some of the effects are purely physiological .
On the one hand , exercise increases leptin transport into the brain which should help some of the other hunger signals work better .
On the other hand , some people can get a blood glucose crash with exercise ( this is especially true in the early stages of a program ) and this can stimulate hunger .
Most research suggests that exercise has , if anything , a net benefit in terms of hunger control but it ’s even more complicated than that .
Whether or not exercise helps with hunger control ends up interacting with psychological factors that I ’m not going to detail here .
Some research suggests that people ‘ couple ’ exercise with their diet .
The underlying psychlogy seems to be along the lines of “ I exercised today , why would I ruin that by blowing my diet ? ”
That ’s good .
However , another category of people often use exercise as an excuse to eat more .
The underlying psychology seems to be “ I must have burned at least 1000 calories in exercise , I earned that cheeseburger and milkshake . ”
Of course , since people basically always over - estimate how many calories they burned with exercise , they end up doing more harm than good .
The short - version of this point is this : for some people , regular exercise ( and it may not be anything more than a brisk walk ) has a profound benefit on keeping them on their diet .
And for others it tends to backfire .
I would mention that the impact of exercise on weight and fat loss while dieting is often overstated .
6. Consider Intermittent Fasting
IF’ing is a current dietary trend that , while exact definitions vary , basically refers to a pattern where someone fasts for some portion of the day ( perhaps 16 - 20 hours ) and eats most of their food during a short “ eating period ” .
Various interpretations are out there but there is emerging research showing a variety of health benefits from this style of eating .
In the context of this article , IF ’ing can be particularly valuable for smaller dieters who simply do n’t get to eat a lot of food each day .
A small female trying to subsist on 1000 - 1200 calories per day and trying to eat 3 - 4 times per day is only getting a few small , relatively unsatisfying meals per day .
However , if that same dieter fasts most of the day ( many find that hunger goes away after an initial spike in the morning ) , she can eat 1 - 2 significantly larger ( and more satisfying ) meals later in the day .
7. Use Appetite Suppressants
The history of diet drugs is a mixed bag but , for the most part , diet drugs have fallen into one of two major categories : metabolic enhancers and appetite suppressants .
Sometimes the drugs do both .
Now , used without changes in diet and activity , these drugs tend to only have small and transient effects .
But the simple fact is that they can help a diet .
The old Dexatrim ( containing pseudoephedrine HCL ) was actually very nice in that it blunted hunger without over - stimulating the person but it ’s not available any more .
There are also various supplements that can help with appetite .
I ’m personally a big fan of the ephedrine / caffeine stack .
Despite scare - mongering to the contrary , EC used properly ( e.g. do n’t take 3X the recommended dose ) is actually quite safe and has both potent appetite suppressant effects along with boosting metabolic rate slightly .
Hell , I thought EC was important enough that I gave it an entire chapter in The Rapid Fat Loss Handbook .
Which is n’t to say that I think every dieter should be using / abusing appetite suppressants from day 1 .
At least try the non -drug strategies first .
But when the hunger is clawing at you making you want to quit your diet , consider using one to help as needed .
8. Adopt Flexible Eating Attitudes
In a general sense , we can divide eating attitudes into rigid and flexible .
Rigid attitudes tend to consider food in a black and white , yes and no good and bad sense .
In contrast flexible eating attitudes avoid that trap .
To fully discuss it would take a book , one I ’ve already written , A Guide to Flexible Dieting .
But let me address it here again breifly .
Let me address this topic with a question “ What would you do if I told you you could never have something again ? ”
Assume it ’s something you like or want , how would you react ?
Odds are you ’d want it that much more , right .
It ’s human nature , we want what we ’re told we ca n’t have .
Guess what , that ’s dieting .
Or at least how many dieters approach dieting .
Many diets are predicated on some food being bad , off - limits or what have you ; dieters go into the diet thinking “ I ca n’t ever eat XXX again in my life ” which just makes them want XXX that much more .
This is one of the psychological aspects of hunger I mentioned in the introduction .
And , of course , the followup to this is that when dieters do eventually eat XXX ( and they will ) , then they just feel guilty and miserable , figure the diet is blown and eat the entire bag or box of XXX and abandon the diet altogether .
It ’s truly a damaging approach to dieting and research has clearly shown that the type of rigid dieter I ’m describing above ( who expects absolute perfection from their diet or it ’s a failure ) do worse than more flexible dieters .
The reality is that , within the context of a long - term diet , even small deviations do n’t really do much harm ( unless the person goes berserk and makes it harmful ) .
That is , say you ’re on a diet and you eat a couple hundred calories of cookies because you really wanted them .
If you ’ve dieted the past 6 days , that ’s no big deal .
However , if you decide that you are a worthless piece of crap with no willpower and eat another 1000 calories of cookies ; well you made it into a problem .
Understand ?
I always recommend that dieters use strategies like free meals ( non - diet meals , preferably eaten out of the house ) , refeeds ( extended periods of deliberate high - carbohydrate over - consumption ) and full diet breaks ( periods of 10 - 14 days where the diet is abandoned for maintenance ) when they diet .
It keeps people from falling into the rigid dieting trap that , invariably , backfires .
Again , all of the details can be found in A Guide to Flexible Dieting .
9 . Suck it Up
I want to make it clear that I ’m not being facetious with the title of this one ; and I ’m only being slightly obnoxious .
Even if you do everything I talked about above , apply every strategy perfectly , the reality is that you will probably still have some hunger on a diet .
Well … too bad .
The simple fact is that losing weight requires eating less than you ’re burning and this will , at some point , generate hunger .
Now , there are exceptions , extremely overweight individuals often find that they have no appetite in the initial stages of dieting but the reality is that eventually hunger will rear its ugly head .
At which point every dieter is faced with a fundamental choice which , put simply is this “ What ’s more important to me , losing weight , or eating this food ? ”
I ’d note that this is also a reason I ’m so adamant about the flexible dieting strategies , at least one way of dealing with food cravings is to include them in the diet in a controlled fashion .
That way the dieter is controlling the diet , instead of the other way around .
But even with that , hunger is a reality of dieting no matter what else you do .
Now , you can try to reframe it ( Tom Venuto in his new book suggested telling yourself that “ Hunger is fatness leaving the body . ” ) or you can simply accept it ( yes , I know , very Zen ) and move on .
But none of that makes the hunger away , it ’s just you trying to trick yourself out of feeling bad about it .
When that point is reached , there are only two options that I ’m going to put very bluntly .
Sometimes you just have to suck it up .

PARIS  Europe sank even deeper into recession than the United States in the closing months of last year , according to figures published Friday , as finance ministers of leading industrialized nations gathered in one of the worst - affected countries , Italy , for discussions on the crisis .
The economy of the 16 countries sharing the euro currency declined by 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter , according to the European Union ’s statistics office .
That is even worse than the 1 percent decline in the United States economy during that period , compared with the previous quarter .
“ Today ’s data wipes out any illusion that the euro zone is getting off lightly in this global downturn , ” said Jörg Radeke , an economist at the Center for Economics and Business Research in London .
Until recently , some economists had thought that Europe might suffer less from the recession , which started in the United States before spreading to most of the rest of the world .
While home prices have plunged in some European economies , including Britain , Ireland and Spain , housing markets have held up better elsewhere in Europe .
Consumers have also cut back less on their spending in Europe than in the United States .

A fascinating analysis of the history of Auto Unions over the last 30 years , and the ways in which corporate decisions ruined the industry .
From The Real News :
TIJUANA , Mexico ( Reuters ) - Mexican drug gangs near the U.S. border are breaking into police radio frequencies to issue chilling death threats to cops which they then carry out , demoralizing security forces in a worsening drug war .
A state policeman at a crime scene where two police agents were gunned down inside their truck in the border city of Ciudad Juarez , January 20 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Alejandro Bringas
“ You ’re next , bastard ...
We ’re going to get you , ” an unidentified drug gang member said over the police radio in the city of Tijuana after naming a policeman .
The man also threatened a second cop by name and played foot - stomping “ narcocorrido ” music , popular with drug cartels , over the airwaves .
“ No one can help them , ” an officer named Jorge said of his threatened colleagues as he heard the threats in his patrol car .
Sure enough , two hours later the dead bodies of the two named policemen were found dumped on the edge of the city , their hands tied and bullet wounds in their heads .
Cartels killed some 530 police in Mexico last year , some of them corrupt officers who were working for rival gangs .
Others were killed in shoot - outs or murdered for working against the gangs or refusing to turn a blind eye to drug shipments .
Violence has hit shocking levels in Tijuana , over the border from San Diego , since President Felipe Calderon launched an army crackdown on traffickers in late 2006 , stirring up new wars between rival cartels over smuggling routes .
The drug war is scaring tourists and investors away from northern Mexico , forcing some businesses to shutter just as the country heads into recession this year .
Badly - paid Tijuana municipal police , often accused of collaborating with rival wings of the local Arellano Felix cartel , are badly demoralized , senior officers say .
“ These death threats are part of the psychological warfare that organized crime is using against officers , ” said Tijuana police chief Gustavo Huerta .
“ Before , the gangs began infiltrating the radio after a police execution , which was bad enough , but now they are doing it beforehand and the force feels terrorized , ” he said .
WORN - OUT BODY ARMOR
Officers in threadbare uniforms and worn - out body armor say they are no match for drug gangs with powerful weapons and state - of - the art technology .
Some police cling to religious trinkets and pray for protection , but many others have taken early retirement .
“ I and many of my colleagues are thinking our time in the force is over , ” said Olivia Vidal , a Tijuana policewoman with 15 years in the force .
“ I have three kids .
Two are at university .
I would never let them follow in my footsteps . ”
Drug hitmen are brazenly using pirate radio decoders to flag police murders in advance on the airwave , often playing the brassy accordion - led “ narcocorrido ” ballads that lionize the escapades of heavily armed , womanizing traffickers .
The gangsters use the decoder to access the radio frequency and then use a transmitter linked to a CD player and a microphone to transmit the narcocorrido music and the threats .
In one recent attack , hitmen killed two officers in their vehicle in Tijuana and then blasted drug ballads over police radio while naming their next targets , just as officers were reaching the first crime scene .
Some gangs sarcastically offer their “ condolences ” over the air after an execution , broadcasting messages like : “ We are so sorry . ”
Has anyone noticed the ugly reality captured in the so - called “ Miracle on the Hudson ” ?
One of the first photos shows that first class passengers were offered first - class rafts to ensure that they ’d survive in comfort , while the economy class passengers were forced out onto the metal wings to fend for themselves .
Kinda sorta looks a lot like a metaphor for the financial crisis .
“ Miracle ” our ass–this is just flat reality in 21st century America .

On one , polls that are “ tightening ” are emphasized over those that are not , and the rest of the news media is portrayed as papering over questions about Mr. Obama ’s past associations with people who have purportedly anti-American tendencies that he has not answered .
( “ I feel like we are talking to the Germans after Hitler comes to power , saying , ‘ Oh , well , I did n’t know , ’ ” Ann Coulter , the conservative commentator , told Mr. Hannity on Thursday . )
On the other , polls that show tightening are largely ignored , and the race is cast as one between an angry and erratic Mr. McCain , whose desperate , misleading campaign has as low as a 4 percent chance of beating a cool , confident and deserving Democratic nominee in Mr. Obama .
( “ He ’s been a good father , a good citizen , he ’s paid attention to his country , ” Chris Matthews , the MSNBC host , said Wednesday night in addressing those who might be leaning against Mr. Obama based on race .
“ Give the guy a break and think about voting for him . ” )
And , perhaps unsurprisingly , each campaign is often at war against its television antagonist , just as the networks are at war with each other .
It is a political division of news that harks back to the way American journalism was through the first half of the 20th century , when newspapers had more open political affiliations .
But it has never been so apparent in such a clear - cut way on television , a result of market forces and partisan sensibilities that are further chipping away at the post - Watergate pre-eminence of a more dispassionate approach .
The more objective approach came as the corporate owners of the networks pushed for higher profits and the newspaper industry consolidated and sought broader audiences .
“ To sell as many copies as you could to as many people as you could , you became what we considered objective , ” said Richard Wald , a professor of media and society at Columbia University School of Journalism and a former senior vice president at ABC News .
ACLU website tracks public surveillance RAW STORY
Published : Monday January 12 , 2009
Print This Email This University of California study finds cameras do not prevent violent crime
In response to a recent rise in public surveillance funding by the Department of Homeland Security , ACLU 's Technology and Liberty program has launched a Web site to let America know  YouAreBeingWatched.us .
The Web site provides news related to public video surveillance , links for more information , ways to take action , a ' horror stories ' tab detailing recent misuse of surveillance authority and a flash map of locations in the US where municipal surveillance cameras have been installed .
 The new site will provide one - stop shopping for users , including the press , who want to know the big picture and the fine details about the spread of video surveillance systems ,  said Caroline Fredrickson , director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office , in a release .
Video surveillance is not a new phenomenon , but the amount of attention that the federal government has been paying is .
In the past five years , the Department of Homeland Security has awarded $ 300 million in grants to state and local governments , all in the name of public video surveillance .
Meanwhile , a timely University of California study has found that San Francisco 's $ 700,000 ' Crime Camera ' program has had no impact on violent crime since its 2005 installation .
The study also states that robberies dropped significantly within each camera 's radius , but notes that this finding is inconclusive .
The CITRIS report , three years in the making , states that " there are good reasons ... to be skeptical that the program , even with modifications , can deter violent crime . "
Barry Steinhardt , director of the ACLU 's Technology and Liberty program , does n't see video surveillance leading to a safer America .
 Public video surveillance threatens to fundamentally change the nature of our public spaces , and we need to track what is happening ,  he said .
 There are few good sources of information about the spread of video surveillance in the United States  we get regular media requests for such a source  and now we have created it . 
A couple of years back , around the time he was turning 50 , Michael Precker was in his prime as a journalist .
He 'd never imagined himself doing anything else : " I knew in seventh grade I wanted to be a newspaperman . "
A graduate of Columbia Journalism School , he was a foreign correspondent for 11 years in the Middle East and wrote feature articles on countless subjects for the Dallas Morning News .
One year , the paper nominated him for a Pulitzer Prize .

That pesky buzz of a nearby mosquito is the sound of love , scientists have known for some time .
But a new Cornell study reports that males and females flap their wings and change their tune to create a harmonic duet just before mating .
Cornell entomologists have discovered that male and female mosquitoes ( Aedes aegypti ) , which can spread such diseases as yellow and dengue fevers , " interact acoustically with each other when the two are within earshot -- a few centimeters of each other , " said Ron Hoy , professor of neurobiology and behavior .
The study is available online Jan. 8 and will be published in a February issue of Science , said Cornell associate professor of entomology and mosquito expert Laura Harrington , a co-senior author on the study with Hoy .
" The frequency at which males and females converge is a harmonic or multiple of their wing - beat frequencies , which is approximately 400 hertz [ vibrations per second ] for the female and 600 hertz for the male , " said Hoy .
The mating duet , generated just before the couple mates on the fly , settles at around 1,200 hertz -- roughly an octave and a half above concert A ( the pitch to which instruments are tuned -- the A that has a frequency of 440 hertz and is above middle C ) .
" That is significantly higher than what was previously thought to be mosquitoes ' upper hearing limit , " he added .
Interestingly , the mosquitoes adjust the harmonic resonance of their thoracic box to produce a harmonic frequency that converges at a frequency that is the female 's third harmonic ( three times her fundamental frequency ) and the male 's second harmonic ( two times his fundamental frequency ) .
The study also is the first to definitively show that contrary to previous thought , female mosquitoes are not deaf .
To study mosquito mating calls , the researchers tethered mosquitoes and flew them past each other while recording the flight tones with a special microphone .
Co-first author Benjamin Arthur , a postdoctoral researcher in Hoy 's laboratory , placed electrodes in the mosquitoes ' auditory organ in their antennae during playback to measure physiological responses of the mosquitoes to the sounds of potential mates .
The researchers hope that their work will provide new ways to better control of mosquito populations in places where yellow and dengue fevers are significant problems .
" By studying these flight tone signals , we may be able to determine what kind of information males and females consider important when choosing a mate , " said co-first author Lauren Cator , a Cornell graduate student who works with Harrington .
" This will allow us to release ' sexy ' transgenic or sterilized males that will be able to successfully compete with wild populations . "
Dengue fever affects 50 million people annually , and two - thirds of the world 's population is at risk .
In recent years , it has reached epidemic levels in Asia , South and Central America and Mexico , where the number of dengue cases has increased by more than 300 percent from year to year .
No dengue vaccine is available , and no treatment exists beyond supportive care .
The study was funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and by a $ 19.7 million Foundation for the National Institutes of Health grant awarded to Harrington and a global team of scientists to cure dengue fever and control the mosquitoes that transmit the viruses that cause it .

( CNN ) -- Gu
Gu is not your typical soft and cuddly giant panda .
Zhang Jiao was attacked by Gu Gu the panda when he fell into the pen at the Beijing Zoo on Wednesday .
For the third time , he 's tasted the flesh of an unwitting intruder in his pen at Beijing Zoo .
His most recent victim was 28 - year - old Zhang Jiao , who told CNN he fell into the panda pen Wednesday while trying to catch a small toy thrown by his young son .
" My son and I were playing with a panda doll , throwing it to each other , when I dropped with the toy " into the pen , Zhang said .
The barrier around the pen is about 5 feet tall , but on the other side is a drop of 9 to 10 feet , and Zhang says he could not climb out .
That 's when Gu Gu went on the attack .
The 240 - pound giant panda sunk his teeth into Zhang 's left leg before moving on to the right leg .
Watch Zhang Jiao talk about being bitten »
" The panda is a national treasure , and I love and respect [ him ] , so I did n't fight back , " Zhang said .
" The panda did n't let go until it chewed up my leg and its mouth was dripping with my blood . "
Zookeepers needed to use tools to pry open Gu Gu's jaws .
Zhang said he never imagined a panda could be so vicious .
" I always thought they were cute and just ate bamboo , " Zhang said .
Watch CNN's John Vause struggle to hold a baby panda »
According to Dr. Wang Tianbing , who treated Zhang , his wounds were severe , especially the damage done to the muscle and ligaments in his left leg .
" Normally , we think the panda is very tender animal , but actually it 's a bear , not a cat .
If the animal thinks it will be hurt by human beings , it is very dangerous . "
Wang should know .
In 2007 , he treated another one of Gu Gu's victims , a 15 - year - old boy who climbed into the pen to get a closer look .
A year earlier , state media reported that a drunken tourist tried to hug the panda , who bit him .
In an odd twist , the tourist reportedly bit back .
But being an endangered species and much - loved national icon means there 's no " three strikes and you 're out " for Gu Gu .
In fact , there 's a possibility Zhang may face charges for entering the panda pen .
Zoo officials did not respond to CNN 's request for an interview but are reportedly considering new measures to keep tourists out of Gu Gu's pen .

JERUSALEM , Feb 11 ( Reuters ) - Israel headed for political gridlock on Wednesday with both sides declaring victory in an election that left the prospect of Israel and the Palestinians making peace as distant as ever .
Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni's centrist Kadima party won the most votes but had little chance of building enough support for a resilient coalition government .
Right - wing opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu can get the backing in parliament , but analysts said the likely alliance would prove dysfunctional .
" I won , " read the headline of the country 's biggest newspaper , Yedioth Ahronoth , over photographs of both leaders .
But to some commentators , the rival claims showed that Israel , deeply beset with divisions over constitutional issues and years of failed diplomacy with Arabs , had lost .
" One thing is clear to all Israeli voters , " said the paper 's Eitan Haber .
" The political system is shattered . "
Washington signalled equanimity .
The new administration of U.S. President Barack Obama wants to revive peace talks to give the Palestinians a state alongside Israel , provided they can repair a schism triggered by Islamist Hamas 's hold on Gaza .
" We certainly hope that a new ( Israeli ) government will continue to pursue a path to peace .
I see no reason to think a new government would do something otherwise , " State Department spokesman Robert Wood said .
Israeli President Shimon
Peres must now decide whether to call on Livni or Netanyahu , who then has 42 days to form a government .
An official election tally is due out by Feb. 18 , after which Peres would have a week to make his nomination .
As the parties began negotiating possible pacts , Israeli media said it seemed Peres would have no choice but to tap Netanyahu if the majority rightists all back him .
But it would be the first time in Israel 's 60 - year history that the winner of an election would be passed over .
The results , not yet official , gave Netanyahu 27 seats in the 120 - seat Knesset , while Livni's Kadima won 28 .
She said she would be prime minister and invited Netanyahu to join a " unity government " .
But Netanyahu said he would lead the " nationalist camp " in parliament , and control 64 seats .
" With God 's help I will lead the next government , " Netanyahu , 59 , told supporters of his Likud party .
" Tzipi Livni has only the slightest chance , or none at all , of forming a government under her leadership , " said Abraham Diskin , a political scientist at Jerusalem 's Hebrew University .
HARD RIGHT IN PIVOTAL POSITION
Avigdor Lieberman 's far - right Yisrael Beiteinu party , which surged to third place in the ballot with its demand to test the loyalties of Israeli Arabs , emerged as a potential kingmaker .
He met Livni and Netanyahu on Wednesday , appearing to favour the latter though he deferred any decision .
Another linchpin party , the conservative Shas , held it own talks with the Likud .
" We want a nationalist government .
We want a rightist government , " Lieberman said .
A deal was needed as fast as possible because the state " has been paralysed for half a year " .
" People may not be aware , but we are still without a budget ... in conditions of global financial crisis , " Lieberman said .
Netanyahu had been cruising ahead in opinion polls until Olmert 's centre - left coalition , including Livni , launched a military offensive against Hamas and other factions in the Gaza Strip , to stop them firing rockets at towns in southern Israel .
The 22 - day January war cost 1,300 Palestinian lives versus 13 Israelis killed , but had massive public support .
After a truce on Jan 18 , the election campaign resumed as Israel pursued Egyptian - brokered talks with Hamas on a durable Gaza truce .
The ceasefire talks are still going on , and uncertainty in Israel will not stop them , both sides said on Wednesday .
European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana said Israel 's next government must also restart serious talks on a comprehensive peace deal , and could not let them stagnate .
" I think if we continue in a crisis management mode , if we do n't enter into a conflict resolution mode it will be going back and back again , " Solana told Reuters .
Livni , 50 , led the main peace talks last year with the Palestinian Authority of President Mahmoud Abbas , and would try to revive them .
Netanyahu is cooler on the key trade - offs for an accord -- ceding occupied land and curbing Jewish settlement .
Lieberman and religious parties in a coalition would be likely to set virtually impossible conditions for a peace deal .
The Palestinian Authority , which governs the occupied West Bank , said that whoever ends up in charge Israel is obliged to continue talks and to meet international obligations .
" The ascent of the Israeli right does not worry us , " Abbas told Italy 's La Repubblica newspaper .
" In whatever form , the government , once in power , will ultimately end up with responsibility , pragmatism prevailing . "
But many Palestinians were gloomy .
" Israelis voted for the right and against peace , " said office worker Ali Zaidan .
" We will not see progress in the peace process in the coming years . "

When the government sets its sights on gaining a new , technologically - enabled ability to keep better tabs on suspected bad guys , they just do n't take " no " for an answer .
They also apparently do n't take " yes , but with strict oversight " for an answer either .
Since October of this year the US Department of Justice has tried four times in four different venues to get the courts to grant them the ability to force cell phone providers to turn over real - time , continuous physical location data on cell phone users , without first having to obtain a warrant or even demonstrate probable cause .
Three times , the DoJ 's request was smacked down by the courts in harshly written opinions , but the fourth time was a charm for the DoJ .
This past Tuesday , a federal judge in New York ruled that the federal government is free to track citizens ' physical locations via their cell phones under a much more lenient legal standard than probable cause .
Unlike the NSA wiretapping case , this does n't mean that the feds do n't have to notify the courts at all , but it does mean that they do n't have to be able to prove probable cause in order to get the courts to grant a tracking request .
I 'm not by any means versed on the legal issues here , but this blog entry by Daniel J. Weitzner at MIT 's Decentralized Information Group has the clearest explanation that I 've seen on what 's going on here .
The entry was written after the first three requests had been denied but before Tuesday 's ruling :
The key legal issue in all of these cases is what level of judicial oversight is required to compel the disclosure of information sought by the government .
Answering this question has turned on whether the data sought is " transactional information " generated by the mobile phone network ( in which case it would be regulated under 18 USC 2703 sections ( b ) and ( d ) ) or that it is equivalent to a mobile tracking device regulated under 18 USC 3117 ?
If it is transactional data then it is available to the government under a so - called intermediate standard , less than probably cause , but more than a simple request .
Under this rule , the government has to give a clear and articulable reason which the data is relevant to an ongoing investigation .
It ca n't just be going on a fishing expedition .
Though the government advocated this position is all three cases , all three courts found that there must be a showing of probable cause .
( This is all personally pretty interesting to me because I did a lot of work advocating for this new protection for transactional data back in 1994 .
At the time we ( and I believe the Congress ) was thinking about transactional information such as email and web access logs .
We were not thinking about real time location data .
My guess is that Congress will have to come back to this question to settle it .
So the primary issue here is not whether the government can track your location via cell phone they definitely can get at cell phone location data , and they 've had that ability for a while but just how much judicial oversight will be required of the feds in exercising this power .
The answer , as of today , is " not much . "
On my very brief and non-expert reading of the opinion , it appears that the judge has ruled that cell phone location data is indeed a form of " transactional information , " government access to which is regulated under 18 USC 2703 ( in combination with a few other statutes ) , and is therefore available to the government under a more lenient standard than probable cause .
From page 21 of the ruling :
... The text of section 2703 ( c ) covers the data the Government seeks here .
The heart of the statute ?
granting authority to obtain " information " about cell phone customers ?
does not on its face contain any limitation regarding when such information may come into being .
It is thus susceptible to an interpretation that the " information " sought might come into being in the future .
Moreover , because cell site data in this District exists as a record before it is transmitted to the Government , the text of the statute does not prevent the Government from presenting daily or hourly ( or even more frequent ) applications to the Court to obtain historical cell site data .
Thus , as a theoretical matter , the statute permits the Government to obtain cell site data on a continuing or ongoing basis even under a narrow reading of section 2703 .
Unlike the EFF , which is outraged by this ruling , I 'm inclined to look on the bright side : minimal , token judicial oversight of law enforcement domestic surveillance activities is always better than none at all .

Ah , the perfect playlist .
In the quest to find a musical oasis where track after track is a pleasant reprieve from the surrounding world , even the best of efforts are often thwarted by limited song selection , an overly complicated user interface , or the lack of insight into upcoming songs .
So we 've scoured the web to find only the best musical offerings and we 've put together a list of five sites that make playlist building a joy .
You may notice that we 've left Pandora and Last . fm off our top 5 list .
Although we love each site for separate purposes , they both , in their own way , complicate the process of hand selecting and fine tuning playlists that are musical masterpieces .
So do n't fret , the 5 sites we 've include are bound to help you construct your best online mix yet .
1. Slacker
We recently pitted Slacker against Last.fm in a head to head battle , and even though Slacker fell to a worthier overall opponent , we think it 's the top site for building out extensive playlists .
One of Slacker 's greatest features is the huge assortment of pre-fabricated stations covering all music genres .
Users can take a slacker approach to listening to music by just tuning into one of these stations and loving or banning songs as they go .
When it comes to customizing and creating the perfect station , Slacker is certainly at the head of the class .
Custom stations are started with ease — just search for an artist or band — and can be fine - tuned to achieve playlist nirvana .
Slacker can recommend related material , and you can add the specific artists or songs you want .
Tired of listening to the same old pop songs ?
With Slacker you can opt to listen to only fringe or unfamiliar songs , minimize or maximize how frequently your favorites are played , and pick and choose from current or classic artists .
Essentially you can build stations from scratch and tweak them to your heart 's content .
Now that 's pretty impressive .
2. Favtape
Favtape , from Ryan Sit and Freestyle Labs , is a mashup of Pandora , Last.fm , SeeqPod , and Slinkset , and it pretty much takes the hassle out of making playlists online .
Favtape 's tag line claims it 's " the easiest way to play music online , " though I would argue that it 's actually the easiest way to make a fantastic online mixtape .
The playlist creation process comes in two varieties .
The simplest way is to create a favtape via search .
You can do your own search for a particular artist or song , view the iTunes top 100 songs , flip through the greatest artists by decade , or search by song year .
Either way , favtape returns a comprehensive list of songs matching your query that you can listen to , or click to add to a new or existing favtape .
Favtape also plays nicely with both Pandora and Last . fm so you can turn your recent activity — bookmarked , loved , and recent songs — into favtape playlists .
Just enter your username for Last.fm , or your profile URL for Pandora , and you 'll immediately get an instant song list that you can play with favtape style .
Plus you can even find similar artists by song , view lyrics , embed selections on your site , and share across Twitter , Facebook , and Stumbleupon .
3. Blip.fm
Blip.fm is n't your typical playlist builder .
The site throws a wrench in the whole music listening experience by going against the grain and automatically creating a playlist based on your friends ' blips .
It might be a little daunting at first , but once you get the blip of things , your listening experience may never be the same .
Blip centers around you as DJ and the individual songs you blip , so as a user you would search for a track you want to blip , write a Twitter - style note about your selection , and blip it for your listeners .
Then , depending on your settings , your blip can be broadcast to social sites like Twitter , FriendFeed , or Tumblr , and even update your Last . fm scrobbler .
As you start to blip a bit more and add favorite friends as DJs , your blip - generated playlist starts to expand .
You can customize a few settings , but essentially every time your DJs blip , their songs will be populated in your mix for a potentially never - ending assortment of songs .
Blip.fm offers a handful of additional features like the ability to view and add DJs with similar tastes , and the option to give your favorite DJs kudos .
Ultimately we think Blip to be a fantastic way to add variety to otherwise monotonous playlists .
4. 8tracks
8tracks , similar to the semi- defunct Muxtape , takes a fun approach to creating custom mixes with the idea being that user - crafted music programming is more entertaining than algorithm - generated lists — so swapping mixes with friends becomes the central focus of the site .
You can do two things on 8 tracks , listen to mixes or create your own , and it 's as simple as it sounds .
Your 8 tracks mixed tape must have — you guessed it — 8 tracks .
Users can either upload their own MP3s or browse from the 8tracks library to drag and drop tracks to build mini libraries .
Once you 've created your playlist you can give it a creative title , write a description , tag it , send it to Twitter , and embed it across the web .
The beauty of 8 tracks , however , has less to do with creating your own music combos and more to do with stumbling across fantastic compilations other members have masterminded .
Given that you only get 30 second snippets when you listen to your own concoctions , it 's probably not the best choice if you want to listen to your music .
If , however , you 're in the mood to experiment , you 'll find some incredibly diverse musical offerings in your mix feed , from the friends you follow , or by experimenting with the popular mix section .
We think 8 tracks is a fantastic way to create community around music , and we love that the playlists you build become like custom radio stations for others to enjoy .
5. Grooveshark
Grooveshark 's simple and clean user interface is designed for creating playlists , making it a breeze to start a new music mix on the fly .
You can quickly search songs , people , genres , albums , and existing playlists to get started , but after your initial query Grooveshark will do the rest of the work for you .
Once you find a song or artist you like , you can start a playlist .
Grooveshark will then recommend songs based on your selection , and you can either favorite songs , play the songs , add them to your queue or playlist , or embed them as a widget on your own site .
As with most sites these days , you can also share your Grooveshark musical selections with Twitter , Facebook , and Stumbleupon , or grab the RSS feeds of your activity to take with you .
Grooveshark continues to play as you browse for new songs , take a look at popular tracks , build up your queue , or upload your own tracks .
Since you have complete control over the songs on your playlist , Grooveshark offers the perfect solution for hassle - free online music streaming without all the guesswork .

Here 's a clown getting busted for speeding on his Suzuki GSX - R and then his subsequent visit to court .
It seems he 'll try anything to get out of it , but it 's the end that packs the extra nice punch .
[ via YouTube ]
WASHINGTON , D.C. – I remarked in my last article “ Ron Paul Shows Some Outrage ( The Gaza Slaughter – Epilogue ) ” that Congressman Paul ( R - TX ) was visibly upset at the end of his 2 - minute opposition speech to House Resolution 34 which called “ on all nations to lay blame both for the breaking of the calm and for subsequent civilian casualties in Gaza precisely where blame belongs , that is , on Hamas . ”
For those who do not follow Ron Paul quite so much , this is unusual as he typically constrains himself from showing anger .
Well , this 4 - minute video released Tuesday night by the Campaign for Liberty reveals why .
The House had called a last minute vote the night before and started the session one hour earlier than normal .
Dr. Paul claims he was notified at the last minute and was barely able to arrive and interject with his opposition for two minutes .
( photo )
Paul also related that Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair are skipping their appointments with the House Finance committee to fly off to the Swiss Alps to meet with the international banking cartel known as the BIS , or Bank of International Settlements .
My guess is that their conversation will cover the price of gold at some point .
[ For readers who may have missed it , I have explained here “ The Money Matrix – How the FED Works ( PART 6/15 ) ” that the Federal Reserve is a fraudulent , powerful quasi- private banking cartel that wields the power to create and destroy money at its own whim .
I also explain here “ Rioting at the Gates of Thermopylae : The Ramparts of the FED & Central Banks Shudder ” how the FDIC ’s so - called “ Deposit Insurance ” is a complete scam . ]
However , it is perhaps fortunate that Ron Paul is probably not aware of the following .
Reuters reported last week that extremely large ammunition shipments will be shipped from our military depots in Greece to Israel , 325 standard shipping containers packed with explosive death .
Why do we have or need depots in Greece you ask ?
We are a Military - Industrial Empire , baby !
Led by our wacky Keynesian economists , this “ builds wealth ” for our arms dealers ( the US government and the defense industry ) , but accomplishes only destruction in warzones .
In early December , the United States shipped another 989 standard containers filled with “ 2.6 million KG of net explosive weight ” from North Carolina to Israel .
In September Congress approved the sale of another 1,000 bunker - buster bombs to Israel to be used on “ penetrating Hamas 's underground rocket launcher sites . ”
Well , at last check , the Palestinians are still unable to afford a Palestinian Navy , so likely this new ammunition will end up being used against both civilians and Hamas in Gaza and elsewhere .
The amount of ordnance shipped in December and January works out to over 2 KG of net explosive weight per Palestinian .
Gotta love to see our tax dollars to see at work !
Right ?
Oh , lost your job or scared of losing it ?
Wondering if you will ever be able to pay the mortgage or spend time in bread lines ?
Wonder what type of country your child will grow up in ?
Do n’t worry Obama ’s Big Government Stimulus Plan will make everyone soldiers or good little socialist puppets – oops , did I just write that ?
I meant to say it will soon be all better now !

Halliburton , vice - president Dick Cheney 's old employer , is the US military 's biggest contractor in Iraq .
It has been under increasing scrutiny by congress and government auditors , and is under investigation by the justice department for tens of millions of dollars in possible overcharges for its work in Iraq .
US army officials said the $ 16.4bn ( £ 8 bn ) contract which gave a Halliburton subsidiary , Kellogg , Brown and Root , exclusive rights to provide food , shelter , laundry services and transport to US forces serving in Iraq would be subject to new bids later this year , and the work could be split between three companies .
A fourth firm would be hired to monitor performance .
Officials said the army was satisfied with KBR 's performance .
But spokeswoman Betsy Weiner added : " The army frequently looks at the way it does business and tries to look at lessons learned and find a better way to do business .
We believe that competition is perhaps a better way to do business . "
Halliburton would be eligible to bid for the work .
News that it would no longer be guaranteed work in Iraq took an immediate toll on share prices , which fell in early morning trading .
But spokeswoman Melissa Norcross said in a statement : " It is neither unusual nor unexpected . "
Halliburton began reaping the profits of the war in Iraq even before the 2003 invasion , with a separate $ 7bn contract to repair the country 's oilfields under the Iraqi reconstruction programme .
The firm was later awarded the contract to provide logistical support to US troops .
In the last few years members of congress have been dogged in uncovering instances of waste and mismanagement by Halliburton and KBR .
Last year auditors uncovered $ 1.4bn in questionable charges by Halliburton .
Former employees accused the firm of double billing on meals , grossly inflating the prices of services - $ 45 for a case of soft drinks - and allowing soldiers at Rammadi to bathe in contaminated water .
Halliburton defends its work in Iraq .
" By all accounts , KBR 's logistical achievements in support of the troops in Iraq , Kuwait and Afghanistan have been nothing short of amazing , " a statement said .
US army officials have also praised the company 's record in Iraq , but the Pentagon evidently has decided that competitive contracts would result in better accountability and prices .
Henry Waxman , the Democratic congressman from California who has been one of Halliburton 's harshest critics , welcomed the move but added : " The administration should have changed course a lot earlier .
Its reliance on abuse - prone monopoly contracts in Iraq has cost taxpayers dearly . "
The end of Halliburton 's dominance in Iraq arrives at a time when the US is phasing out its role in Iraqi reconstruction .
The Washington Post reported yesterday that 90 % of the $ 18bn allotted by congress for rebuilding post - war Iraq has been spent or allocated .
The rest of the money needs to be allocated by the end of September .
Gordon Brown , at the time of the Government 's October bank bail - out , confidently told Newsnight : " You have got to get a restructuring right .
I think people would take exception to a situation when there was a partial proposal and then we had to come back with another partial proposal , and then another … .
What we have done is a far more comprehensive programme than ever people were asking for . "
Last week the Prime Minister announced " the next steps " in his rescue of the banks .
He was wearing the same tie as in October , and this was n't " the next steps " , just another rushed emergency .
Inside an Afghan battle gone wrong : What happened at Wanat ? ( I )
Just before dawn last July 13 , Taliban fighters attacked an outpost in eastern Afghanistan being established by U.S.
Army soldiers and fought a short , sharp battle that left many American dead — and many questions .
But the U.S. military establishment , I ’ve found after reviewing the Army investigation , dozens of statements given by soldiers to investigators , and interviews with knowledgeable sources , simply has not wanted to confront some bad mistakes on this obscure Afghan battlefield — especially tragic because , as the interviews make clear , some of the doomed soldiers knew they were headed for potential disaster .
First , here ’s my account of what happened that day , drawn from the official investigation and other sources :
The 45 Americans , mainly from 2nd Platoon , Chosen Company , 2nd Battalion , 503rd Infantry Regiment , part of the 173rd Airborne Brigade , had begun building a patrol base in the Waygul River valley village of Wanat on July 8 .
There also were three Marines present , who were training Afghans , and 24 soldiers from the Afghan army .
( The initial Army report said two Marines , but subsequent documents corrected this . )
The platoon ’s leader was there the whole time , but the company commander was busy elsewhere and only arrived the day before the attack .
None of their superiors visited the outpost during that time .
Significantly , there was no overhead surveillance by unmanned aerial vehicles because of bad weather , according to Army documents .
At 4:20 a.m. , just before sunrise , volleys of rocket - propelled grenades began to hit the base .
There were approximately 200 attackers , according to the Army investigation .
They began by concentrating on the American ’s heavy weapons — a 120 millimeter mortar , a TOW missile system , and a .50 caliber machine gun .
It felt like “ about a thousand RPGs at once , ” Spec. Tyler Hanson later told an Army interviewer .
With the first two heavy weapons knocked out , the Taliban moved in to fight just feet away from the Americans , making it difficult to call in air strikes against them .
Enemy fighters threw rocks into their Americans ’ fighting holes , apparently hoping they soldiers would mistake them for grenades and jump out , exposing themselves to fire .
Enemy fire was coming from every direction .
“ The whole time we were thinking we were going to die , ” said Spec. Chris McKaig .
Many did .
When most of the fighting was over , about an hour later , nine American soldiers were dead and another 27 were wounded .
Between 21 and 52 of the attackers were killed .
The Americans held the outpost , which is impressive , considering their 75 percent casualty rate .
Those are the facts of the matter .
They are not in dispute , except for the size of the Taliban force , which one account claims is smaller than the Army ’s estimate of 200 .
You can read a redacted version of the Army ’s 15 - 6 investigation at the “ Wanat ” page on Wikipedia .
Also , here is a Army Times ’ outstanding view of the battleground .
It is an interesting case to study especially because of the discrepancy between what is known about the incident and what has been learned from it .
In other words , the facts gathered by Col. Mark Johnstone in the Army investigation are compelling , but the conclusions drawn from those facts are not .
Rather , the Army appears determined to shy away from the lessons indicated by those facts .
Here is what the Army concluded — basically that we did OK , we should have had a Predator overhead , and that we should n’t have trusted those lousy Afghans .
And then let ’s talk about how brave our soldiers were :
The soldiers did fight valiantly at Wanat .
I am in awe of them .
As one reported to the Army investigator , “ I continued to lay suppressive fire with the 240 [ machine gun ] but it was difficult because I was unable to stand due to wounds in both legs and my left arm . ”
When this soldier ran out of ammunition he realized that he was the only one left alive in his corner of the outpost , with the enemy so close he could hear them talking .
It takes nothing away from the soldiers to say that there are other lessons to be learned here .
“ You go through the 15 - 6 and your heart sinks , as you see all this , ” said one person who has reviewed most of the data gathered on the battle .
Indeed , one way to honor them would be to look at what might have been done better to help them .
But the Army seems positively determined not to study the Wanat incident .
A few weeks ago , two interviews about the battle were posted on Fort Leavenworth ’s very good series of Operational Leadership Interviews — but then were removed .
Screwups are inevitable in war .
But there are serious questions to be addressed here — and I hope to do so over the next few days on this blog , drawing on the investigation itself and other sources who have raised concerns with me about the painful , and so far unlearned , lessons of the battle .
As one Army source put it to me , “ The paratroopers sent to Wanat knew they were in big trouble .
Although the battalion HQ was only 7 km away , these guys lacked class 4 [ construction and fortification materials ] , ran out of water and had little material to build up their defensive positions . ”
Indeed , some of the statements made by those who fought raise the question of whether their concerns are being heard by their superiors .
Before leading the Wanat mission , Lt. Jonathan Brostrom , who died during the fight , told his best friend in the battalion that “ he thought it was a bad idea and knew he was going to get ‘ fucked up , ' ” according to that friend ’s sworn statement .
Taking corrective steps is , of course , what the chain of command should be doing , but does n’t appear to have done .
“ I would not characterize this as anything more than the standard fighting that happens in this area in good weather that the summer provides , ” Col. Charles Preysler , commander of the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team , told Stars & Stripes about a week after the battle .
In other words , nothing to see here , move on .
If the brigade commander and others in the chain of command do n’t want to think about the lessons to be learned here , then perhaps the Army Inspector General should - a good IG is more about instruction than punishment .
Failing that , the vice chief of staff of the Army , Gen. Pete Chiarelli , might direct Lt. Gen. William Caldwell at Fort Leavenworth to have some experienced officers aid the Center for Army Lessons Learned in a review .
I have heard that a historian at Leavenworth ’s Combat Studies Institute had been working on a history of the battle , but I ’ve also been told that his study for some reason has been put on hold .
In the next several items , I will discuss specific lessons that might be learned about resources , planning , support and other life - and - death issues .

War hero defeated by NHS after hospital stay left him with three infections and fractured pelvis
He survived the vicious conflict with the Japanese in the jungles of Burma .
But veteran Albert Marriott has been reduced to a wheelchair - bound shell by a spell in the care of the NHS .
Mr Marriott , 90 , was admitted to hospital after a fall at home .
He then picked up superbugs Clostridium difficile , E.coli and MRSA - and fractured his pelvis in a fall from a hospital bed .

By the time he was finally released 20 months later and transferred to a nursing home , he was unable to even get dressed without help .
There is little chance he will get better .
His daughter , Sue Davies , 57 , told how the independence her father once cherished had been ' taken away by the inadequate standards of cleanliness and care in the NHS ' at two separate hospitals .
He must now use his pension and savings - and may have to sell his home - to pay for his weekly £ 384 care home bill .
Miss Davies said the family had made formal complaints about his care at both Clay Cross Hospital in Derbyshire and the Royal Chesterfield Hospital and may seek compensation .
' It has beaten him .
He used to be active , read the papers and have a view on things and now he is a shell and does nothing , ' she said .
' Hospital is a place you go in to be looked after , not where you go to get fractures and infections .
It 's so hard for him , he 's a man of dignity and pride and I feel it 's all been taken away from him . '
Mr Marriott fought in Burma during the World War II before working as a joiner .
A father - of - two , with four grandchildren and three great grandchildren , he has lived alone since his wife Lillian died at 63 in 1981 .
In June 2007 he was bruised after a fall at home and was admitted for three weeks to Clay Cross community hospital .
However , his health began to deteriorate .
He developed pancreatitis and had to have a catheter because of other problems .
He was then struck by the first of a series of infections and ended up going backwards and forwards between the two hospitals .
According to Miss Davies he had E.coli and C.diff at the same time .
After a month of treatment in the Royal he was well enough to return to Clay Cross .
But in January 2008 he fractured his pelvis falling from a bed and was sent back to the Royal .
The fracture was missed by doctors , who believed he was simply bruised .
Miss Davies said : ' He was in so much agony he was crying . '
The pensioner was sent back to Clay Cross with morphine to help with the pain and two days later the fracture was diagnosed by another doctor and he was sent back to Chesterfield .
Once on the ward again his condition deteriorated fast .
' He was so poorly I was asked if I wanted him to be resuscitated if anything happened .
He became delirious .'
Miss Davies said she believes his deterioration was down to the infections .
' He looked like he was dying and we were told more or less that he was , ' she added .
She claimed he had another bout of C.diff and later had a minor MRSA infection too .
Eventually Mr Marriott was moved to a ward which had just had a ' deep clean ' and his health improved .
He went back to Clay Cross and after months of looking for a suitable nursing home he was discharged .
Miss Davies said : ' He can't do anything for himself now , apart from feed himself .
The NHS hospitals are responsible for this and should pay for his care . '
Tracy Allen of Derbyshire Community Health Services said : ' We are very sorry that Mr Marriott and his family feel that we have let him down . '
She insisted he only had one episode of C.diff , was known to have E.coli ' on admission ' and was ' colonised ' with MRSA while in hospital .
The Chesterfield Royal Hospital said Miss Davies ' complaint would be investigated .
Many of you may have heard the term ‘ Greenwashing ’ , yet , it is becoming more and more common in today ’s marketplace .
With the explosion of all things green , organic , natural , eco friendly , and environmentally conscious has come deceptive marketing .
Greenwashing originally has been defined as ‘ to market environmentally friendly behaviors or products with an underlying purpose of profit increase ’ , however it has morphed into a more underhanded marketing technique of promoting a product or feature as environmentally responsible when it has little to no affect at all .
It can get very shakey around things such as automobiles , or products by which their very existance are damaging to the environment being marketed as ‘ green ’ in the relative sense of having less of an impact on the environment .
This is to be expected in a society where people tend to jump on bandwagons without taking adequate time and energy to explore what they are committing to .
We become less discerning , or may not even know what the reasons why we are suddenly drawn to buying a certain way .
Similar to the way fashion changes with the wind ( I have some old day - glow and fluorescent jackets to prove it ) , we are sucked in by marketing and pop culture which can easily deceive us into believing we are doing something for a reason .
The classic , and perhaps defining greenwashing example is the hotel industry ’s practice of placing green placards in each room promoting the reuse of towels to ‘ save the environment ’ when no effort was given to conserve , recycle or do anything different to back this claim .
It was simply a way to cut laundering costs by promoting the guest to reuse their towels .
While this does actually benefit the environment , the hotels were making no additional effort to ‘ save the environment ’ .
A less observed and perhaps underlying example of greenwashing can be described by a package of smoked salmon I saw recently .
The packaging read : “ All Natural Supreme Pacific Salmon ” , however upon closer inspection , the fine print read : “ Farmed Atlantic Salmon ” .
Now how can this be ?
It seems like a blatant mis-representation of the product , and it is !
Let ’s start with “ All Natural ” .
Natural is a vauge , undefined and unregulated term marketers like to use because it can describe just about anything , but portrays a sense of un- processed , wholesome , fresh product .
To be a conscious consumer , you must learn to ignore this word because it is meaningless .
Second , “ Supreme Pacific Salmon ” is the brand name , but its use as the headline spread across the product makes you believe that it is from the Pacific Ocean when in fact it is not .
What makes this a greenwashing issue ( in addition to misleading ) is that many individuals avoid farmed salmon for environmental and health reasons .
Farmed salmon is very impactful to the environment , and many employ antibiotics and growth hormones to increase production .
While greenwashing is beginning to penetrate all areas of our life , from food to home decor , bedding , clothing , electronics and automobiles , it is up to us as informed consumers to separate the true eco-friendlies from the spin .
A great , and sometimes humorous resource for greenwashing is the greenwashing index , where users can post and rate greenwashing offenders .

Colorado Governor Bill Ritter ’s choice of Michael Bennet to replace departing Senator Ken Salazar ( Salazar is leaving Congress ’ esteemed higher body to become Obama ’s Secretary of the Interior ) is already drawing criticism .
Bennet , the reform - oriented head of the Denver school system , has never run for office in his life and has never held a statewide position .
There is little evidence that suggests he can hold onto the seat when challenged by a Republican in 2010 .
A few weeks ago , when Bennet was generating buzz as a possible Secretary of Education , I spoke to a friend who is a charter school teacher in Denver .
She was skeptical .
Naturally , I asked her for her thoughts on Bennet ’s latest move .
They are below .
Throughout the last four years , I ’ve been able to follow Michael Bennet ’s work because of my position as a teacher in the Denver Public School system .
I have supported his radical ideas about how to fix the school system , which primarily involved closing down schools and restaffing them with talented teachers .
Our education system is run by unions and red tape , but it felt like no one told Bennet that .
He approached his superintendent position the only way he knew how , as a businessman , and he got results .
He worked in the communities with the people most in need and came up with out - of - the - box ways to fix them .
Maybe the best thing about Bennet was the fact that he could get people on board with his radical ideas and unite a population of people who are typically against change .
Michael Bennet has been , in many ways , the answer that Denver needed .
I guess that we wo n’t find out if he truly is the man that we need , because as of yesterday we should be calling him Senator Bennet .
While I can go on and on touting Bennet ’s potential for greatness , true greatness would come from finishing the job that he has started , and that is something we have not seen .
His work on our school system has been aggressive , but it is not done .
His Denver Plan calls for long term change , over decades , work that will now have go on without him .
It makes me wonder :
What does it take to become a senator ?
Yes , Michael Bennet is a popular man in Denver .
And yes , Bennet is doing great things for our city .
However , with less than five years as superintendent and a resume in business before that , it makes me wonder what Bennet has really done to earn this .
He was on the road to greatness , but he is n’t there yet .
Are n’t we being a little premature here , Governor Ritter ?
What Happened With Hitchens
Lefty blogs have the details of this wrong .
I was n't there .
I was there , however , for the immediate after - action report , and have heard it told ten times by now , including most of it from Hitchens .
Although I did n't really bother asking much , as I 'd already heard it .
Hitch and two others were out on some or such errand .
One guy was just telling Hitchens that the Syrian Nazi party had little support in the country but was paid by Syria to kill people , and that he'd been told they 're the one party you do n't fuck with .
So five minutes later they come across the poster for the Syrian Nazi Party on an abandoned bagel shop -- abandoned , if I had this right , after Hezballah had attacked it last year due to the overly Jewish connotations of bagelry .
So Hitchens immediately takes out a pen and writes " No , no , Fuck You " on the poster .
I do n't know if he 'd digested the story and decided to fuck with them anyway , or else he was just reacting to the modified swastika on the poster .
Now , the Syrian Nazis are not popular and neighborhoods have tried to get their posters taken down .
But then they threaten people and cause problems .
So the state leaves them up .
To avoid getting their posters defaced or torn down , they post a paid Nazi watcher to keep an eye on their posters .
Well , when this Syrian Nazi goon saw Hitch do this , he confronted him and kinda - sorta attacked him .
I say kinda sorta attacked , because what his main intent was was to delay Hitchens from leaving -- until the ten Nazi goons he had just texted on his cell phone could arrive .
There was some kicking and pulling and hitting .
Hitch and the others attempted to get into a cab -- the Syrian Nazi goon got right in the cab with them , still hitting Hitchens .
They could not force him out .
Eventually they all exited , and attempted to get a fresh cab , but other cabbies were now hip to the fact the Syrian Nazis had been riled and wanted no business from them , so two cabs passed refusing their fare .
Now at this point the ten Nazi goons showed up ( about five minutes into this -- they came quickly ) and Hitch and the other two were probably going to get the crap beaten out of them , at best .
However , they finally managed to get a cabbie who was either brave or did n't know the trouble he was getting into and got in , this time without the goon , and left the other ten behind .
Now , as far as the damage Hitch suffered , it was n't much .
He did get some lumps -- a knock on the leg , a scrape on the face .
And also his writing hand had been stomped on .
He 'd been roughed up a bit , but did n't have " the shit beaten out of him . "
If I had n't been told the story I would n't have known he'd been fucked with at all .
Apart from a bit of pain walking and some more pain typing , he was fine .
So , that 's the story .
I was holding off on it until we were out of the country , but some rat we ran into apparently began blabbing it to his rat - like kin .
And to be honest , I 'm personally kinda sick of hearing it myself , and it felt like gossip , but as the early reports are wrong in the details , I 'll have a go .
It did n't happen in a bar .
It happened mid-day on the street .
It was n't a drunken brawl .
I have no idea if Hitchens had drank at all , but if he had , it was like his typical lunch - time bloody mary .
( I 'm not saying he did n't get drunk -- just not then . )
And no one had the shit beaten out of him .
The lefty bloggers saying they 've " confirmed " this are apparently talking to people not in a position to confirm it at all .
Re-Posted : I took this down but I see it 's everywhere , including Forbes , so I guess I 'm not protecting anything .
I 'm not confirming any other details though .
Update : I got it a bit wrong on how much Hitchens had been roughed up and the exact sequence here .
He had underplayed it , I guess .
From another witness I got that he'd been roughed up more than he let on .
First of all , there were n't ten goons , but around six .
Second , the goon squad , and not just the look - out man , did in fact get to Hitchens .
They knocked him down to the ground , kicked him while he was down , and stamped on his writing hand ( which I 'd known ) .
I had thought they escaped the gang , but they did n't , not quite ; they got roughed up by them before a cabbie got them away .
Oh , and the errand they were on : Well , they were on their way to a bar .
But they had n't gotten there yet .
It was about , oh , 3 or so in the afternoon .
We had downtime between events ( which were scheduled around the clock pretty much ) and I guess they just wanted to check out a local watering hole .
Here 's what I know word - of - mouth about the Syrian Nazis :
They 're actual Nazis , first of all , having taken inspiration from Hitler and sporting a modified swastika on their posters and flags .
They 're a small party , I 'm told .
They had been banned years ago but are back , but not in force .
There are about 300 of them ( again , this is what I am told ) and are more of a street - gang of bullyboys than an actual party .
However , they have the backing of Syria , and they do , when called upon , murder people .
This is a small review of some monuments in Moscow , Russia .
The one above is probably can be called a monument for the Donkey from “ The Shrek ” movies , the resembles is astonishing .
I do n’t know the name for this , but it seems it might be called something like “ Half - a - boy speaks with two headless - girls ” .
This one is about some crazy train , who sacrificed a pair of his wheels and left them on rails in order to get freedom and travel freely without rails .
This one is the only official monument devoted to the water - pipe system .
It is even taller than nearest multi-stored buildings .
There were many monuments to Lenin erected during the Soviet Era , but this one should beat all the records of weirdness : here Lenin stands on some sort of self moving railroad car constructed specially for one human to stand on top of it …
I wonder if this monument has traveled across the Russian railroad system to distant villages to introduce advanced Soviet Art ideas to respected countrymen .
And this one is also from the Soviet Era times , it depicts a “ Worker Man ” with something that nowadays youth calls a cell phone .
It looks very timely in this age of phones or iphones madness .
If you liked this you ’ll probably would like to see this old post about the alike monuments from other Russian cities .

Ponginator is a robot , and as far as robots go , this one is fairly simple .
It plays music , says a few words cribbed from audio files , and shoots ping - pong balls from pressurized air guns .
We ’ve been doing a series on crazy inventors with crazy inventions .
Vernon Graner and the creation he built with the Austin Robot Group , Ponginator , certainly qualify as crazy .
Of course , what makes Ponginator different is that Ponginator is three stories tall .
A Parallax stamp - based microcontroller in a computer behind the robot controls the robot ’s ping - pong balls , which leave the barrel at 170 miles per hour .
We speak with Vernon Graner , one of the inventors of Ponginator , in this next video .
The robot was built to promote the Robot Group and to get people asking questions about robotics in general .
If you ’re in the Austin area , and think building your own multi-story monstrosity of pingy , pongy death is right up your alley , check out The Robot Group ’s site .
They ’re the people you want to talk to if you are going to “ try this at home . ”
Otherwise , do n’t try this at home .

Students occupying four houses owned by the University of Melbourne have been told they must leave the properties .
The Student Housing Action Collectives ( SAHC ) have occupied the houses in Carlton since August .
They are trying to pressure the University to provide more affordable student housing .
The Supreme Court today ruled the university has the right to recover the properties .
However , a spokesman for SHAC , Teishan Ahearne says the students will not leave .
" This is our home .
People living at SHAC do n't have anywhere else to go , " he said .
" So we 've been providing housing for people who are otherwise homeless for four months now and we see absolutely no reason to leave . "
In a statement , the university 's acting Vice - chancellor , Peter McPhee , says the university continue to seek the cooperation of the squatters and hopes they will leave the properties voluntarily .
The air here is always dry .
Thin , but also thick .
A white pipe the width of a soda can reaches from floor to ceiling , making the never - ending music of a rainstick .
From it comes enough heat that even on the coldest days of winter I ’ve had to keep the window open at least a crack to counteract its effect on the room .
On the coldest nights , I still use a fan .
Hot and cold perform their rival dance for me , constantly .
The cat looks up at me , knowingly .
Her eyes are a dull yellow and translucent , with cold blackness in the middle .
What does she know ?
Blah , blah .
Must one describe like that ?
Really ?
Must every scene be thus set ?
In a period of lull between frantic freelance projects , I ’ve been going back to the 2004 book Killing the Buddha : A Heretic ’s Bible , the first volume that came out of KillingTheBuddha.com , where I ’ve recently begun working as an editor .
And ( maybe it ’s because I have n’t read a novel in ages ) I ’m blown away by how everything is so drenched in imagery and description .
It ’s delightful .
From page 28 :
The pipes of the church ’s organ swelled — that weird , spiraling hysteria at the high end of the scale , raising the eybrows of the music ’s bass foundations .
Highs and lows wrenching us apart , making us all into Emma , nothing but sensation and reflection — hot and cold , bright and dark , hard metal and soft flesh , smoke rising and a building collapsing [ read : 9/11 ] — as the pulse and melody of the music collided in the final phrases of the song .
( Oh lookie there , it talks about hot and cold too ! )
The way I ’ve been writing lately , this is how I ’d say the above :
We listened to the church organ and thought of 9/11 .
It was n’t always like that for me .
The first assigned book in my first college writing course was The Street of Crocodiles by Bruno Schultz .
As the title might help you imagine , the whole thing was beautiful descriptive imagery .
Beautiful filler .
But that book was the guidepost for all my early writing — which in those days was fiction .
The first lines of the novella I wrote that semester read like this :
and the walls and the chairs and tables and stairs let out their breaths and held for not daring to make a sound over the silence inside , over the wind blowing furiously from out towards Boulder .
Still air hanging , suspended , hung over the hard wood floor like an unwelcome guest , perfectly welcome but feeling unwelcome and frozen still in the corner among all the merrymaking that to the merrymakers was n’t really all that merry except for the sound of the wind blowing through the dark stained walls , that was all they listened to , it was n’t so terrible merry as the air might have thought .
Geez .
What happened ?
I went to graduate school
I stopped writing made - up fiction and started writing about real stuff
I started having to write for money
When I think back to the experience of writing that ( and I love that passage of mine , whether you do or not ) , I know where it comes from .
Dwelling in those descriptions taught me what would come next .
The hardest thing about writing fiction was making up events , and with description I could twiddle my thumbs and keep my pen moving until , accidentally , something happened out of it all .
Now , since the events that I write about are already provided by so - called reality , there ’s no need to bother with any such nonsense .
I ’m no Hemmingway .
Plainness does n’t come from principle .
Reading back through Killing the Buddha , and through my own writing c. 2002 , feels nostalgic , not disgusting .
I ca n’t help but sense that resplendent , dizzying passages are what writers are supposed to do .
Yes ?
No ?
Have I gotten lazy ?
Or just more matter - of - fact ?
Katie Holmes Tight Leather Pants ( Photos )
was photographed leaving her Manhattan apartment building on Tuesday within her arms .
Is it just us or does the two - and - a - half year old look like she might be a handful figuratively and an arm load literally ?
Sorry Suri - actually we think you just have a strong aversion to the paparazzi .
How about those leather pants on Katie ?
Fashion hit or miss ?
We 've seen any number of fashion statements , including baggy man jeans rolled at the cuff while Katie has been staying in the Big Apple .
How do you get into and out of those tight , tight leggings ?
Holmes has spent the summer rehearsing for her Broadway debut in Arthur Miller 's play All My Sons .
The show has been doing previews since September 18th and will officially launch on October 16th .
The place has been packed at nearly every performance and the box office has grossed close to $ 700,000 thus far .
Early reviews indicate she holds her own in a very challenging role among some veteran performers .

I was traveling over the past two days , so there ’s no “ She Got Me Pregnant ” vlog this week , I ’m afraid .
Instead , please enjoy this series of five public - service ads featuring happy lesbian and gay families .
The ads are a production of Get to Know Us First , a non-profit group sponsored by Power Up ! films .
The ad featuring a gay black couple with five kids aired across California on Tuesday , before , during , and after the Presidential Inauguration , on Good Morning America , The Today Show , Despierta America ( Univision ) and Levantate ( Telemundo ) , many regional news stations , and CNN , and FoxNews .
KABC -TV , a California ABC affiliate , refused to air the ad ( PDF ) , however .
According to Chris Yokogawa , the media buyer for Get to Know Us First ’s ad agency , “ They said it was too controversial to air during the Inauguration , since ‘ many families will be watching . ’ ”
Yup .
Ca n’t have families watching ads about other diverse and happy families , now can we ?
It might teach tolerance or something .
Not all that glitters is gold .
And not everyone touting to be a financial expert should be regarded as such .
Americans have lived in what could be considered a decade built on a debt façade .
As many Americans strolled their neighborhoods , possibly taking the dog out for a walk , many suddenly would come across a neighbor with a new sleek silver Mercedes Benz or other foreign car .
Many thought , “ how could it be that they now have the means to afford a $ 100,000 car ? ”
At this point , many could have resisted the siren call but many actually mistook debt for wealth and went out and went into debt to also get a luxury car .
This story replayed itself many times over especially with the allure of the 3 decade long housing bubble .
The Federal Reserve issued its Survey on Consumer Finances last week and this largely went underreported because the fixation has been on the stimulus plan .
Yet this detailed look at the finances of American families shows us how the average American household has lost a decade of wealth largely in part to the obsession created by the housing and banking industries ( two industries now draining the government for incredible sums of money ) .
Many are now awaking from their debt slumber to realize that the luxury car , the large home , and all the household amenities financed by debt were never really an asset .
It was a borrowed identity .
It was as if millions of Americans had the chance to live the life of a tiny millionaire even though they had negative balance sheets .
The survey highlights this problem .
In this article , we are going to examine the balance sheet of the American family to see where the money actually went .
We will try to break down some of the myths but also look at the menace that is deflation that shows up in lost wages and declining home values , which apparently has shocked many in the mainstream media but is very predictable if you only follow the money .
What we will find in the article is how the top 10 percent of our country have had a largely profitable decade while the other 90 percent have been running in the same place and falling back .
The first chart we should look at is the source of income for most Americans .
There is this large notion that most people are self - employed but this in fact is a myth .
The large majority of Americans actually earn a paycheck from an employer .
Another important point is 75 percent of Americans do n’t derive any income from capital gains yet we constantly hear about this .
Let us look at a chart highlighting some fascinating data :
So what can we gather from this data ?
For both 2004 and 2007 , nearly 90 percent of Americans derive most of their income from wages .
Business , farm , and self - employment income makes up a very small percentage of income for 90 percent of Americans but for the top 10 percent , it makes up 21.5 percent .
Capital gains are virtually invisible for 75 percent of Americans and creeps up for those in the 75 to 89.9 percentile range .
This survey is released every 3 years .
So what happened in 3 years ?
For the top 10 percent , in 2004 “ business , farm , self - employment ” and capital gains made up 29.8 percent of the income for those in the top 10 percent .
Guess what happened in 2007 ?
Those 2 sources now made up 39.1 percent .
Next time you hear the cries of capital gains just remember who they are talking about here .
So we have established that the vast majority of Americans derive their income from their wages paid by employers .
So how did wages do over this time ?
You ’ll first see some strong growth for the 1998 - 2001 survey .
I would venture to guess that a large part of this was due to the tech bubble .
But the startling data is for the 2001 - 04 and 2004 - 07 data .
The median income has fallen over this timeframe .
The disturbing point is that for the most recent survey , the mean income has gone up and this was largely based on the stock market and real estate bubble which benefited the top 10 percent while neglecting the bottom 90 percent .
You need only look at the data to verify this information .
Plus , it is n’t like the Federal Reserve is actually trying to encourage Americans to save although this data is screaming for us to do so .
Yet a point emerges and that is , the Fed may actually realize that Americans have nothing to save hence their lack of focus on increasing savings .
It is a moot point .
The survey is rich with data .
The place where this wealth discrepancy is shown the most is when we look at the actual numbers for income and net worth :
For the latest survey , 80 percent of Americans families make less than $ 98,200 and 90 percent make less than $ 140,900 .
And any financial expert worth anything realizes that true wealth is signified by your net worth .
That is , assets – liabilities = net worth .
If you have a $ 700,000 home but owe $ 800,000 you are not wealthy although people that look at your home may think you are .
Yet as we all know , most Americans loaded up on real estate which is now in a major decline and this data largely does not capture this fall .
The true story is revealed on that net worth figure .
For those at the 25th percentile net worth increased by $ 1,400 . ( 11 % )
For those at the 50th percentile net worth increased by $ 29,000 . ( 31 % )
For those at the 75th percentile net worth increased by $ 106,100 . ( 39 % )
For those at the 90th percentile net worth increased by $ 279,900 . ( 44 % )
When you start breaking down the numbers you can see who has been doing the best this past decade and at the expense of the vast majority of Americans .
The next chart I want to show is the massive amount of debt used to fuel the real estate bubble :
It is interesting to note how much money was funneled into real estate during this time .
The biggest debt for the majority of Americans is the primary mortgage .
This steadily increased from 1998 to 2004 .
You also see a jump in debt to finance “ other residential property ” as many bought vacation or investment properties .
This slight jump is big since the mortgage market is over $ 10 trillion .
But take a look at debt to finance other investments aside from real estate .
It falls in half over this decade .
This tells you where people were dumping their money .
Another chart shows us that many Americans took out more equity from their homes but also used this money to finance other real estate purchases :
So as you can see , the obsession with housing has been a very bad move financially for our country .
So guess who is on the other side of the equation ?
Debt to commercial banks and mortgage or real estate lenders steadily increased over this decade .
And guess which institutions are asking the government for the largest sums of money ?
It is that top 10 percentile that actually profited the most during the boom times .
And as the data shows us , the average American household has n’t had a jump in wages over this entire time .
Interestingly enough , over this past decade Americans as a whole have pushed away from financial assets .
Take a look at this chart :
Only 17.9 percent of Americans own stocks outright but what has grown is the usage of retirement accounts which of course are simply a different way of holding stocks .
And this was an unfortunate move .
Since stocks and retirement accounts make up over 50 percent of the financial assets , many have seen large declines since the markets have shed nearly 50 percent of their values .
As much as Americans want to consider that they are diversified they are not .
Consider the amount of Americans that own psychical gold as an asset for example :
Just to give you a sense , gold was at $ 270 back in May of 1999 and is now at $ 950 an ounce .
Most of the time gold was seen as an archaic form of holding on to your money but this is just to highlight how ill diversified Americans were for the economic shock we are going through .
Diversifying meant to many that you owned a bunch of U.S. stocks and real estate in a few locations .
Even if people had 10 percent in other assets aside from real estate and stocks , many would be in better shape .
Yet much of this comes from the structure of the system .
The obsession with housing and debtor mentality are now going to come under direct fire .
The data in the survey shows us that many Americans were really just borrowing the artifacts of wealth for a few years .
Ironically , those that made the loans are asking the government for a bailout while most Americans are losing their main source of income , their wages .

PARK CITY , UTAH -- Little Miss Sunshine they ain’t .
A documentary about a cutting - edge exhibitionist who lost his mind and a narrative feature about a girl from Harlem dealing with incest picked up the two big jury prizes at this year ’s Sundance Film Festival .
Despite a strong showing in the program with four films in competition , Canadian filmmakers were shut out of the awards announced Saturday , with the exception of an honourable mention to Halifax filmmaker Jason Eisener ’s short , Treevenge , which offered a look at Christmas from the evergreen ’s point of view .
We Live in Public , Ondi Timoner ’s ( Dig ! ) non-fiction film about artist Josh Harris and his webcam experiment gone awry , picked up the Grand Jury Prize for U.S. documentary .
The film followed Harris as he and his girlfriend allowed their lives to be recorded and streamed on the Internet with the help of 32 motion - activated webcams in their home .
The relationship hit the skids in short order , but the fireworks clearly made for an entertaining examination of privacy in the digital age .
Lee Daniels ’s ( Shadowboxer ) Push : Based on the Novel by Sapphire , was a big buzz film at the festival for its raw , but potent , portrayal of a young woman who ’s impregnated by her own father but somehow manages to overcome life ’s intense challenges .
The movie won the Grand Jury Prize in the U.S. Dramatic competition , as well as the U.S. dramatic Audience Award .
In the international branch of the festival , the big winners were Rough Aunties and The Maid .
Rough Aunties tells the story of women who care for abandoned and orphaned children in Durban , South Africa , and it picked up the World Cinema Jury Prize : Documentary for its British director Kim Longinotto .
Chilean director Sebastian Silva earned the World Cinema Jury Prize : Dramatic for The Maid , a narrative peek into the world of domestic “ help ” and their uneasy relationships with the people they serve .
In addition to the edgy Push , audiences also responded well to Louie Psihoyos ’s The Cove , a documentary about the underground , and underwater , world of performing dolphins , and the people who supply them to attractions around the world .
Another audience favourite was Havana Marking ’s Afghan Star , a documentary about the introduction of the American Idol format into the former Taliban - led country .
The World Cinema Audience Award for dramatic feature went to An Education , the latest film from Lone Scherfig ( Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself , Italian for Beginners ) starring Peter Sarsgaard , Emma Thompson and breakout star Carey Mulligan .
Set in 1961 , the movie is a coming - of - age story about a young woman who befriends a charismatic older man , and must deal with the life - altering consequences .
The awards were handed out at a gala presentation Saturday night , drawing the 25th Annual Sundance Film Festival to a close .
Compared to previous years , this year ’s festival was considered an unqualified success , despite severe cutbacks in the entertainment industry and a consolidated press corps .
Critics were impressed by the overall quality of the programming , the lack of ambient swag suites and a renewed commitment by festival organizers to program work that falls outside the mainstream , and would never get a shot at the world stage otherwise .

Samsung has just introduced a product that Al Gore should love .
Actually , anyone who cares about the environment and wants to wear their " green " concern on their sleeve -- or in this case , in their hand or next to their ear -- should find Samsung 's new solar - powered , " Blue Earth " touch - screen phone an appealing way to stay connected in style , while producing less climate - damaging COin the process .
The Blue Earth phone includes a solar - charging panel on its backside , which Samsung claims " can generate enough electronic power to call anytime anywhere . "
While this sounds promising , Samsung has yet to release the precise specifications and details of the phone , such as how long the panel needs to charge , or how long the solar - charged battery will last in terms of standby and talk time .
As you will not always be able to charge the phone using the solar panel - - such as on rainy days or if you are indoors and not near a window -- the Blue Earth also " comes with a 5 star energy efficient charger which uses standby power lower than 0.03 W .
" Getting its power from the sun is not the Blue Earth 's only claim to environmental friendliness .
It will come with minimal packaging , made from recycled paper .
In fact , even the phone itself is made from recycled materials : " Blue Earth is made from recycled plastic called PCM , which is extracted from water bottles , helping to reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions in the manufacturing process .
The device , including charger , is free from harmful substances such as Brominated Flame Retardants , Beryllium and Phthalate .
"
The phone will also include an " Eco mode , " which can be set with a single click .
The Eco Mode will put the phone in a power - saving mode by doing things such as lowering the screen brightness , reducing the backlight duration , and setting " Bluetooth to an energy - efficient mode . "
An " Eco Walk " feature takes advantage of the phone 's built - in pedometer , " calculating how much CO2 emissions have been reduced by walking as opposed to motor transport .
" While Samsung claims that the Blue Earth is the " first solar powered full - touch screen phone , " it is not the first solar - powered phone that we 've seen .
Two years ago at CeBIT 2007 , a Chinese company , named Hi-Tech Wealth was showing of a solar - powered phone ( albeit , not a touch - screen phone ) , which it called the " Light - Energy Mobile Phone . "
Additionally , the concept of using solar power to charge cell phones and other consumer electronics is not new ; several companies manufacture solar chargers designed for this specific purpose , such as Brunton Soldius , and NRG Dock Samsung states that the Blue Earth is " designed to symbolize a flat and well rounded shiny pebble . "
There is no word yet on when the Blue Earth will be available , which service providers will offer it , or how much it is expected to sell for .
However , on February 16 , Samsung 's www.samsungmwc.com site will launch , and it will presumably have more details about the phone .
Additionally , Samsung will be officially unveiling the phone on the 16th at the Mobile World Congress trade show in Barcelona , Spain .

OCaml Meeting 2009 in Grenoble -- subscription open
Archive : http://groups.google.com/group/fa.caml/browse_thread/thread/6ca934db724432fc#
For the second time , I am proud to invite all OCaml enthusiasts to join us at OCaml Meeting 2009 in Grenoble .
This year event will be in Grenoble just after JFLA .
We choose this location because a lot of OCaml enthusiasts will probably already been there and to avoid last year collision between the two events .
The subscription is now open for participants .
The fee are 32 € and cover the lunch .
You should use the link provided on the wiki page to subscribe : http://wiki.cocan.org/events/europe/ocamlmeetinggrenoble2009#Participants
We are still looking for people wanting to give a talk around OCaml subjects and to volunteer to help to help before / during the event .
The list of possible talks is actually : - OCamlCore.org news and projects - OCaml Batteries Included - Cameleon / Chamo - Delimited overloading Further information : http://wiki.cocan.org/events/europe/ocamlmeetinggrenoble2009

More cores
Archive : http://groups.google.com/group/fa.caml/browse_thread/thread/fb0c0fa0ca985555#
Is it time to start rethinking concurrency in OCaml ?
I have followed the argumentation of only using one native thread for the OCaml runtime .
I can easily see how this can increase performance and simplify implementation .
I can also see that spawning new processes makes sense , so you get a local heap for each task .
However , as we move forward it seems that we will get more than a few cores on the same computational node according to the following article : Intel says to prepare for ' thousands of cores ' :
http://news.cnet.com/8301-13924_3-9981760-64.html?part=rss&subj=news&tag=2547-1_3-0-20
As I see it , it is not feasible to spawn a new process with a local heap for each core , when the number of cores increases dramatically .
I am not sure that a parallel GC is a sufficient solution either due to the high contention on memory , at least unless it provide some additional core affinity features .
I believe some level of compiler support is needed in the not so distant future such that enough primitives are available to build powerful multi-core aware libraries .
One approach could be micro heaps with core affinity and handle mutable memory specially .
That 's a recurrent topic in this list .
I 'll summarise the arguments and save us all some time : i) Someone raises the issue that it 's time for Ocaml to go multicore . ii )
A few voices go " yeah ! " and state that with a concurrent GC , Ocaml can take over the world .
Their argument is as follows : 1 ) Ocaml gets a concurrent GC ; 2 ) ... 3 ) Profit ! iii )
A voice of reason notes that the devil is in step 2 ) above .
If your programming paradigm for concurrency is Threads +
Mutexes , then you are exposing yourself to a world of pain in race conditions .
At this point someone usually links to Xavier 's standard speech on concurrency ( which is a few years old , but as poignant now as it was then ) .
iv )
The voices from step ii ) retort that they 're über - programmers and that they can make perfectly scalable and race condition - free programmes with Threads +
Mutexes if only they had a concurrent GC .
v)
The voice of reason remarks that one of the main reasons we all chose Ocaml is because the language ensures safe , resilient programmes .
In a way it 's the humble recognition that we are human , and that we make mistakes .
Choosing the Threads + Mutexes path would be hubris and an abandonment of fundamental reasons why we chose Ocaml in the first place .
While I tend to agree with viewpoints iii ) and v ) , I do think a healthy discussion on the subject of multicore is in order .
Though I suggest we focus the discussion on concurrency models that will allow us to take advantage of those multicores in a safe , sane manner : a ) Could Jocaml be the future of Ocaml ? b)
How do we handle the global mutability issue ?
Well , it 's fun to join the old discussion in the new times .
The fact that computers go multicore at a greater scale makes it recurrent .
Erlang makes concurrency easy due to purity , and OCaml is famous for being eclectic .
Why not embrace Erlang 's model by imposing limitations on what can be in threads -- keeping them pure ?
Erlang model works and attracts people to functional programming in general .
Even if some other model of concurrency prevails , it is interesting and useful to interop with Erlang easily .
Here 's what Erlang folks have started : http://code.google.com/p/erlocaml/
Doing this properly can solve a lot of needs out there , and bring lots of debugged , proven , high - quality concurrent server and communication code within reach .
Also worth reading is Ulrich Drepper 's series on current and future system architectures .
I 've highlighted the important parts of this long series below , but you can find the complete list of links at the end of part 1 .
Part 1 : http://lwn.net/Articles/250967/
Part 2 , on CPU caches : http://lwn.net/Articles/252125/
Part 4 , on NUMA : http://lwn.net/Articles/254445/
Part 8 , on future technologies : http://lwn.net/Articles/258154/
Uli has recently been advocating languages like OCaml (+ fork , numactl and virtualization obviously ) for future architectures which will involve massive numbers of cores and very long paths to main memory .
Not especially for multicore , but for parallel programming , this might be of interest : http://camlp3l.inria.fr/eng.htm
( To mention this by me also is recurrent , as the thread we are in ... )
Ciao , Oliver P.S. : During the last multicore discussion , I found that link , but had not tried OCamlp3l .
Now I think I will have more time and motivation and it could be compiled and installed without any problems with OCaml 3.10.2 .
> Has anyone tried it with 3.11 ? > >
I had an idea to try out some fork - based OCaml programming to exploit > the 4 & 8 core machines we have here , but maybe can try this instead .
The prelude .ml project has some fork - based parallel functions for lists , arrays , strings and bigarrays : http://github.com/kig/preludeml/tree/master/prelude.ml
While I have not tried OCamlp3l on 3.11 yet , my guess is that it would work .
It is a pure - OCaml set of libraries along with some helper scripts / programs and as far as I know there is not any caml p4 involved .
After speaking with the authors , the package does seem to be more focused on distributed computing than local parallelism .
It is still possible to use it for local parallelism though .
OCamlp3l is currently going through a rewrite as Camlp3l though the restructuring is not complete at this point .
CVS repositories for both are here -- http://camlcvs.inria.fr/cgi-bin/cvsweb/bazar-ocaml/
Please let us know how it goes if you do try one or both of these out .
Here 's a Fedora package : https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=477313
I do n't think this is packaged in Debian yet , so I had to make a few decisions about packaging : - the ocamlfind name is ' preludeml ' - the package name ( in Fedora ) is ocaml - preludeml - no upstream versions , so I packaged it as " version 0.1 " , dated 20080922
> OCaml is extremely bad at parallelism , even embarassingly parallel tasks > because OCaml still has to marshall all the data in a gather operation or > resort to manual memory management .
Merjis implemented the Ancient module to handle this case , and we shared the code with an open source license so everyone can benefit : http://merjis.com/developers/ancient
camlp4 vs camlp5
Archive : http://groups.google.com/group/fa.caml/browse_thread/thread/23e0ce83a6f9598d#
OCaml 3.09 OCaml 3.10 OCaml 3.11 ..... + + + camlp4 -----+---> camlp4 was -----> camlp4 development --> " new " camlp4 \ rewritten continues \ \ \ not everyone agrees with the rewrite , so old caml p4 -----> camlp5 development continues as camlp5
All the distributions now ship OCaml , camlp4 and camlp5 .
This means you can continue to compile and use pre-3.10 software which relies on the old camlp4 ( now called camlp5 ) .
Or you can use the new caml p4 which has some nice bits ( like Reflective OCaml and the " scrap your boilerplate " stuff ) .
The worst thing is the lack of good documentation for caml p4 .
The wiki is a good start ( http://brion.inria.fr/gallium/index.php/Camlp4).
I 've said it before , there 's a good book 's worth of material in this subject .
If you prefer looking at code , then take a look at : http://code.google.com/p/bitstring/ ( camlp4 ) http://merjis.com/developers/pgocaml ( camlp4 ) http://alain.frisch.fr/soft#openin ( camlp4 & camlp5 ) http://martin.jambon.free.fr/micmatch.html

OCamlSpotter : OCaml compiler extension for source browsing , version 1.0
Archive : http://groups.google.com/group/fa.caml/browse_thread/thread/fa755ee340f46ea5#
Here is your free holiday gift , OCamlSpotter version 1.0 , a small patch for OCaml 3.11.0 .
OCamlSpotter : OCaml source browsing ====================================
Camel spotter :
Oh , it was extremely interesting , very , very - quite ... it was dull ; dull , dull , dull , oh God it was dull .
Sitting in the Waterloo waiting room .
... from You 're No Fun Anymore , Monty Python 's Flying Circus OCaml module language is powerful .
So extremely powerful that you can be lost yourself easily inside a huge OCaml project with tons of modules .
Spotting the definition of a variable is sometimes " extremely interesting " .
Let 's see such an " exciting " example : include M open N open O let _ = f 1
Suppose you are not familiar with the function f and want to spot its definition .
Where to find it ?
Just from the code you are looking at , it is not sure : if you are enough lucky it may be f in m.ml , n.ml or o.ml .
Otherwise , it may be O.f in n.ml .
Or probably N.O.f in m.ml .
If you are unlucky and the project is so sophisticated , there could be complex module operations in m.ml ( i.e includes , functor applications ) and therefore the definition might be found somewhere completely unexpected .
Module packing , module load paths and library installation without .ml files complicate the situation even worse .
You first days after joining a large OCaml project should be this kind of manual value definition spotting with find + grep commands .
Yes , actually it is very educational : you can learn a lot about the project struggling in the source tree ( only if your collegues have organized things very well : - P ) , but it is still a dull job ...
To say short , OCamlSpotter is a tool which does this dull job automatically for you and permits your energy for something more " interesting " like Yeti spotting : - The - annot option of ocamlc and ocamlopt is extended and creates < module >. spot files ( < module >. spit for .mli ) , which record the location information of the names defined and used in the module . -
A small application ocamlspot provides automatic where - about spotting of the definition of the name you are interested in .
- ocamlspot.el provides interactive ocaml - spotting of definition locations in emacs .
- Interfaces for other editors such as vi can be built easily , if you want .

Another one down , more to come ...
It 's worth noting that these early busts can be tied directly to a management decision -- specifically the decision to load up on debt .
These companies would have survived a lot longer if they had n't borrowed so much money .
Shira Ovide , Wall Street Journal : Journal Register Co. , the debt - strapped owner of the New Haven Register and 19 other daily papers , filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Saturday , at least the third newspaper publisher to tip into bankruptcy court in recent months .
Journal Register has been plagued for more than a year by an unsustainable level of borrowing , made worse by an industry - wide plunge in revenue .
Journal Register 's woes stem from an acquisition binge , the pinnacle of which was a 2004 deal to buy a chain of Michigan newspapers for more than $ 400 million ...
Since last summer , Journal Register has operated under the auspices of a restructuring adviser , and the company had stopped making interest payments on its borrowings and closed dozens of newspapers as it worked to fend off creditors ...
In its bankruptcy documents filed in Manhattan bankruptcy court , Journal Register said it had assets of $ 596 million as of Nov. 30 and $ 692 million in debt , including unpaid interest .
Watching Michael Steele in action is simply fascinating .
This guy seems to be exactly what some Democrats feared Obama might be like ( and never turned out to be ) , a guy that seems to be trying way too hard to try to change the packaging on the party , and not so interested in actually presenting a coherent platform that one can feel comfortable voting for .
I think during the nomination process in 2008 what Democrats were most afraid of when considering supporting Obama was the thought of nominating a dud that would turn out to be all flash and no substance , so watching Steele in action is kind of like watching an alternate universe where Barack Obama was actually the candidate that everyone feared he might be .
Just take a look at some of his recent statements .
Here 's one :
RNC chair Michael Steele says he is " open to that baby " when it comes to supporting primary challengers against the three GOP senators who voted in favor of the stimulus package .
" Oh , yes , I 'm always open to everything , baby , absolutely " Steele said yesterday on Fox News ' ' Your World with Neil Cavuto ' .
“ We want to convey that the modern - day GOP looks like the conservative party that stands on principles .
But we want to apply them to urban - surburban hip - hop settings . ”
He added , jokingly , that “ we need to uptick our image with everyone , including one - armed midgets ... I do n't do ' cutting - edge , ’ ” he said .
“ That 's what Democrats are doing .
We 're going beyond cutting - edge . ”
beyond
“ Tonight , we tell America : we know the past , we know we did wrong .
My bad .
But we go forward in appreciation of the values that brought us to this point . ”
Uptick the image with one - armed midgets - that 'scutting - edge ! and another one today even Michelle Bachman is getting into the spirit :
As Steele concluded his remarks , Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann — the event 's moderator — told Steele he was “ da man . ” “ Michael Steele !
You be da man !
You be da man , ” she said .
Michael Steele seemed a lot like something I had seen on tv before , and then I realized what it was - Michael Steele is Poochie from the Simpsons .
In case you 're one of the few people that does n't watch Simpsons , Poochie was a character created for one episode when executives decided that Itchy and Scratchy needed some pizazz , and that the way to do that would be with a rapping dog with sunglasses and a surfboard .
Needless to say , his appearance did n't do anything for the show 's popularity , everybody hated the new character and they got rid of him as soon as possible .
Here 's the audio of him making his first appearance :
( BTW let me know if you 're able to upload a video showing the actual Poochie in action during this scene and I 'll change it )
way
Some readers seem to think my description of Obama as boring is meant as a criticism .
Subjectively , maybe it does n't give me a Lowry .
But objectively , it 's brilliant .
The first black president will only get there by boring a lot of white people .
And have n't we had enough drama in the last eight years ?
Boring is fucking awesome after Bush .
Michael Steele Poochie
Michael Steele is tryingtoo hard to be cool , before even working on a reason for people to even vote GOP in the next election .
I 'm reminded of a great quote from last year by Andrew Sullivan where he wrote :
This is true with everybody - all people want a bit of boring out of their politicians .
Unplanned coolness here and there is great of course ( " Barack Obama is a fan of The Wire ? "
" Hey , he collects comic books ! "
" He uses a Blackberry all the time ! " etc. ) , but people want to discover this on their own , and they do n't want to see a kind of unholy meshing of politics and individual coolness .
If Barack Obama had run as a super cool " I - understand - young - people - ' cos - I - like - The - Wire - and - comic - books - and - technology - y' all " candidate he would have lost .
The situation at the moment is too serious and people just are n't in the mood for games .
Edit : Stephen Colbert seems to be thinking much the same thing ( except for the actual reference to Poochie ) .
Here 's a video from the Colbert Report today : Edit a few hours later : wow , I just did a search forand it looks like I 'm not the first to notice the connection - here here , and here .
Looks like a few other people have noticed the similarity .
7 Million UK Homes to Receive Free Insulation
February 11th , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
It ’s a full - on insulation war between Australia and the UK , with the former announcing free insulation for 2.2 million homes last week , and the latter announcing a program yesterday to give 7 million homes free retrofits .
The UK ’s insulation scheme will be funded by £ 1 billion in energy saving initiatives from UK firms .
Additionally , homes receiving insulation will be encouraged to install solar panels and wood - burning boilers .
Conservatives in the country are also proposing grants of up to £ 6,500 for retrofitting per household , which could be repaid over 25 years from savings on gas and electricity bills .
More details on the UK ’s grand plan will be announced this Thursday .

Day 9 of “ The 12 Days of a Bacon - Wrapped Christmas “ brings us a bacon - wrapped tofu .
This recipe is quick & easy and quite tasty since the tofu really takes on the flavor of the other ingredients .
Buy yourself a pack of firm tofu .
We chose a non-refrigerated variety .
Take the tofu out of the pack and wrap it in some paper towels .
Put a heavy book on top of the tofu block for about 10 minutes to squeeze out a lot of the moisture .
Get some soy sauce …
and some brown sugar …
and combine the two in a bowl .
Mix the soy sauce and brown sugar together to make a thin marinade .
Now , slice the tofu in cubes and trim some raw bacon strips in half to fit your cubes of tofu .
Wrap the bacon around the tofu cubes .
Secure with toothpicks if necessary .
Dip each cube in the marinade .
Cover the tofu / bacon cubes generously with the marinade .
Cook the cubes in a frying pan over medium heat until the bacon is as crispy as you like .
You ’ll probably have to turn the cubes a few times as you cook .
The final result is a pretty , great tasting treat you can use as an appetizer for nearly any meal .
This recipe earns a solid Smaste™ rating of 38.92 .
Highly recommended !

Japan 's imperial family is confronting a sharp crisis of confidence as it searches for a meaningful role in modern Japanese society .
While still revered , the imperial family – whose head was considered divine until 1945 – is increasingly pitied as its members struggle with their tightly constrained lives .
And with Emperor Akihito 's reign in its twilight , many Japanese are daring to ask what has been unspeakable for centuries :
Does the country really need an emperor ?
Japan 's royals are expected to work tirelessly , acting as a unifying force and fostering hope during difficult times .
But so great has the stress on the family become that the Imperial Household Agency ( IHA ) announced Thursday that it will reduce the ailing emperor 's official meetings with dignitaries , have him attend far fewer religious rituals , and end his role giving speeches at national athletic events .
The decision is just the latest in a string of setbacks for the world 's oldest ruling imperial line .
According to his doctors , Emperor Akihito , who has been increasingly vocal about his concerns about the family 's future , is suffering from " mental agony . "
His wife , Empress Michiko , has long struggled with her position in the family , with consequences for her health .
Rumors of a breakdown have swirled around Crown Prince Naruhito 's wife , the Harvard - educated Princess Masako , who , before her marriage , captivated the nation with her vivacity and rising stature as a young diplomat .
" They are the picture of unhappiness , " says Herbert Bix , professor of history at Binghamton University in New York and author of the Pulitzer Prize - winning book " Hirohito and The Making of Modern Japan . "
" They seem to have been denied human rights , " he adds .
" You can understand their angst . "
Much of the trouble can be traced to the difficulty of establishing a modern role for an imperial line so old that its origins are a matter of scholarly debate .
The 1947 Constitution imposed by US occupying forces stripped the family of its divinity and made the institution more symbolic , while at the same time incorporating it into the office of the prime minister .
They became , in effect , permanent wards of the state .
The royals have no private money , no private phones , and essentially no private lives .
Even relationships within the family are managed by the 1,200 - person IHA , which has not been diffident in sharing its views .
" The values of the imperial family are not part of the equation , " says Jeffrey Kingston , director of Asian Studies for Temple University 's Japan campus .
The head of the IHA once publicly chided the crown prince for not visiting his parents more frequently .
And last year , the IHA – which did not answer questions submitted to them for this story – announced that the emperor and empress were " deeply hurt " by a remark the crown prince had made .
Another IHA official famously announced after the birth of the crown prince 's only child , a daughter : " Frankly speaking , I want them to have another child . "
As easy as it is to paint this as a battle between good and evil , modernists and traditionalists , the imperial family versus the IHA , the story is more complex , says Shinji Yamashita , an IHA employee for 23 years and now publisher of a quarterly magazine about the royals .
First , says Mr. Yamashita , many IHA employees have worked in other divisions of the government for years .
They are not , he says , a uniformly traditional bunch .
Yamashita says the real battle is within each organization , not between them .
" Both the IHA and the imperial family are trapped between the constitutional role of the imperial family and the sentiments of the people , " he says .
Yet many Japanese , says Yamashita , want the emperor to continue the long tradition of leading Shinto rituals , encouraging age - old cultural practices , and inspiring the nation .
But all the emperor 's statements have to be approved by the prime minister 's office .
Not surprisingly , most of what he says is bland .
Before he assumed the throne , then - Crown Prince Akihito complained that being emperor meant becoming a robot .
He pledged to transform the Chrysanthemum throne .
By some measures , he has succeeded .
He was the first royal to marry a commoner , and he allowed the empress to raise their children herself instead of packing them off to nursemaids .
His schedule includes stops at facilities for the elderly and he often spoke of issues related to the graying of Japan , a pet topic .
When earthquakes hit Japan , he and the empress visit victims .
The couple once touched their countrymen 's hearts by getting down on the ground to bow to those made homeless by a disaster .
The emperor has tried to make amends with Japan 's neighbors during his visits in Asia by speaking openly of the suffering inflicted by Japanese troops during World War II .
He has also tried to heal wounds within the country , visiting every prefecture in the nation during his reign .
But his day - to - day schedule is hardly the stuff of headlines – signing documents , accrediting senior officials , welcoming foreign ambassadors , and the like .
Now , Japanese are looking to his eldest son for further change .
The Oxford University - educated prince has indicated he would like to transform the institution .
He has moved in that direction , first by marrying a career woman and more recently by complaining that his wife , Princess Masako , had no meaningful work .
The majority of Japanese , according to most polls , support changing the Constitution to allow Naruhito and Masako 's daughter to ascend the throne – a view that was gaining momentum until Naruhito 's brother and his wife had a son in 2006 .
Support is still broad for the royal family , says Yamashita .
" Old people , in particular , would feel a sense of loss if the institution was abolished , " he says .
" But in 30 years ' time , maybe people would n't feel that way . "
Tokyo resident Shizuka Coats remembers going with her grandfather to the Imperial Palace every year on the emperor 's birthday to be among the throng of well - wishers waving Japanese flags and hoping for a glimpse of the emperor .
She has n't been since her grandfather passed away .
Neither does she plan to start the same ritual with her children .
" I feel very distant from the royal family , " says Ms. Coates .
" I think the crown prince must change things to make the family more relevant . "

Customs say the pigeons were not endangered
A man has been caught with two pigeons stuffed in his trousers after he got off a flight from Dubai to Melbourne .
Australian customs officials say the live birds were wrapped in padded envelopes and held to the man 's legs by a pair of tights under his trousers .
Officials also found two eggs in a vitamin container in the man 's luggage .
Australia has strict quarantine rules on the importation of wildlife , plants and food .
The man , 23 , could face up to 10 years in jail .
The nation 's quarantine regulations are designed to protect health , agriculture and the environment .
As well as 10 years ' imprisonment , the maximum sentence for wildlife smuggling includes a fine of A$ 110,000 ( US $ 70,480 ; £ 48,902 ) .
Customs officials say they also seized seeds in the man 's money belt and an undeclared aubergine , following the flight on Sunday .
They add that the pigeons were not endangered and that the case , as well as the birds , eggs and seeds , has been turned over to the country 's Quarantine Service to assess the health risk .
So the government have taken over one of the zombie banks ?
Anglo .
The bank that likes to say Yes when its directors want to borrow a hundred million euros on the sly .
Why ?
Why did n’t our government tell them to get stuffed when they came looking for a guarantee of their liabilities ?
Why did n’t they tell them to fuck off down the toilet with their despicable , crooked speculator buddies and their ridiculous property deals that have fucked up the Irish economy ?
It would have been very simple .
After all , it is n’t as if Anglo are part of anything bigger than the unlettered cabal we ’re pleased to call developers in this little island .
As a simple conduit for speculative money , Anglo has no involvement in day - to - day life and its demise would have had no impact on the economy .
So why ?
You ’d have to ask yourself why the government did n’t let this zombie return to the grave where it belongs .
Would you like to know ?
Very well , then , since you ask .
The reason is that Anglo provides funding for the shuffling gobshites who buy and sell property in this country , and those very same shuffling gobshites are the ones who quietly siphon cash to the shuffling - gobshite party : Fianna FÃ¡il .
And who are Fianna FÃ¡il ?
Why , none other than the government of this fine , incorruptible land .
Is n’t that a nice , neat circularity ?

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- A Saudi national released from U.S. detention at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , in September 2007 is believed to be a key leader in al Qaeda 's operations in Yemen , according to a U.S. counterterrorism official .
Ali al - Shiri was released in 2007 from the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
The Defense Department recently estimated that more than 60 terrorists released from Guantanamo may have returned to the battlefield .
According to the counterterrorism official , Ali al - Shiri traveled to Yemen after being released to Saudi Arabia and may have been involved in recent al Qaeda attacks in Yemen , including a car bombing outside the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa last year that killed nearly a dozen people .
" He is one of a handful of al Qaeda deputies in Yemen , " the official said .
" He is one of the top terrorists . "
His title is deputy and senior operations commander , the source said .
According to the magazine Sada al - Malahem , or the Echo of the Epics , published by al Qaeda in Yemen , al - Shiri attended a media session in which Yemen commander Abu Baseer was interviewed .
The magazine identified al - Shiri as Baseer 's deputy commander and quoted Baseer as announcing that al Qaeda 's operations in Yemen and Saudi Arabia have been combined to become al Qaeda on the Arabian Peninsula .
The magazine noted that al - Shiri was released from Guantanamo more than 10 months ago .
He fled a Saudi jihadi re-education program , where he went after his release , a Saudi source told CNN 's Nic Robertson .
President Obama on Thursday signed an order mandating that the Guantanamo Bay prison be closed within the year .
What to do with the detainees has been a hotly debated topic .
The issue of freed detainees engaging in terrorism is one concern .
Another is housing them in prisons inside the United States .
Watch experts debate the Guantanamo dilemma »
Rep. Bill Young , R - Florida , said he has " quite a bit of anxiety " about the possibility of transferring detainees to U.S. facilities .
" Number one , they 're dangerous , " Young said .
" Secondly , once they become present in the United States , what is their legal status ?
What is their constitutional status ?
I worry about that , because I do n't want them to have the same constitutional rights that you and I have .
They 're our enemy . "
Obama 's decision to close the Guantanamo facility received immediate backing from his general election opponent , Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain .
McCain , in a joint statement with South Carolina GOP Sen .
Lindsey Graham , said he supported Obama 's decision to " begin a process that will , we hope , lead to the resolution of all cases of Guantanamo detainees . "
But Thursday night on CNN's " Larry King Live , " McCain said the new president may have been hasty in the decision and should have taken the time to consider everything associated with closing the camp before forcing himself into a timetable .
Specifically , McCain said he thought Obama needed to consider what would happen to the prisoners held at Guantanamo before ordering the facility to be closed .
" So , the easy part , in all due respect , is to say we 're going to close Guantanamo , " McCain said .
" Then I think I would have said where they were going to be taken .
Because you 're going to run into a NIMBY [ not in my backyard ] problem here in the United States of America . "
Watch what may happen to Guantanamo 's inmates »
Asked about that issue Thursday , Defense Secretary Robert Gates said , " We have developed some options in terms of how many we think could be returned to other countries to take them .
That diplomatic initiative has not started .
That will await work in carrying out the executive order . "
" We have identified a number of possible prisons here in the United States " that could take the detainees .
However , Gates added , " I 've heard from members of Congress [ representing ] where all those prisons are located .
Their enthusiasm is limited . "
CNN 's Barbara Starr contributed to this report .

Reports of Vélib ’s Demise Greatly Exaggerated
JCDecaux touted Vélib on the cover of its 2007 annual report [ PDF ] .
If you ’ve read this BBC story currently making the rounds , you ’d be forgiven for thinking that Vélib , Paris ’s wildly popular bike - share system , has suddenly been afflicted by an epidemic of theft and vandalism that threatens its very existence .
Vélib bikes have been " torched , " strung up from lamp - posts , and smuggled across borders , the Beeb reports in alarmist tones .
A spokesman for JCDecaux , the outdoor advertising firm that operates Vélib , calls its contract with the city of Paris " unsustainable , " and the whole system is referred to in the past tense .
So is Vélib destined to burn brightly only to flare out after a short time ?
Hardly .
Vélib is here to stay , according to officials and transportation experts familiar with the details of its operations .
The BBC ’s portrayal of a mortal threat , they say , is best understood as a negotiating ploy on the part of JCDecaux .
( Note that the JCDecaux representative is the only source quoted in that story . )
" Decaux is using media sensationalism in order to obtain more money from the city of Paris , " said Denis Baupin , who as Deputy Mayor for Transportation oversaw the Vélib launch in the summer of 2007 .
The basic structure of the Vélib contract works like this .
JCDecaux runs the whole system in exchange for the rights to 1,600 outdoor displays , turning its profit from selling that ad space .
The city of Paris keeps the revenue from Vélib user fees , so it can claim to provide the service at no taxpayer expense .
Now , with the full Paris network of 20,600 bicycles and 1,451 stations completed , penalties for inadequate maintenance are in the process of taking effect .
Hence the hue and cry from JCDecaux .
" It ’s in large part a PR issue , " says Luc Nadal of the Institute for Transportation and Development
Policy .
Some aspects of the Vélib contract are still in flux , and the sky - is - falling press coverage
gives JCDecaux a stronger hand in those negotiations .
" Their bargaining position depends on the public ’s perception . "
Not that bicycle abuse is a phantom problem .
It exacts a real toll , but much of that cost has been anticipated and accounted for .
Last July , the city of Paris agreed to pay JCDecaux 400 euros for every bike stolen in excess of four percent of the total fleet each year .
Given the enormous popularity of Vélib — users have taken 42 million rides since its debut — the cost of those payments is minimal .
Using the BBC ’s figure of 7,800 missing bikes , the pricetag for the city comes to less than 2 million euros annually , out of 20 million euros in user fees .
" It averages out to about 15 stolen per day , out of 80,000 daily users , " says Eric Britton , founder of the Paris - based New Mobility Agenda .
Hardly a fatal blow .
" It ’s like skinning a knee . "
Not only does the city already pick up a big part of the tab , but JCDecaux reportedly hauls in about 80 million euros per year from its outdoor displays , according to estimates cited by Britton .
It ’s difficult to know the exact figure — and how much is profit — because JCDecaux guards the data like a nuclear secret .
Even the precise cost of replacing one Vélib bicycle remains unknown to the public .
Inquiries we sent to JCDecaux ’s headquarters in Paris have not been returned .
Public support for Vélib remains unflagging .
" Vélib has been totally embraced by Mayor Bertrand Delanoe himself , " said Nadal .
What politician would n’t jump at the chance to be identified with a program that enjoys 94 percent satisfaction among constituents ?
This is largely a testament to JCDecaux ’s success in operating the system .
According to Baupin ’s office , however , Vélib maintenance workers report that management has let upkeep slide in order to amplify the perception of vandalism .
JCDecaux ’s media gamesmanship " is short - sighted , " said Baupin , in a statement translated from the French .
" One
should not lose sight of the remarkable success of this
transportation mode due to a slightly underestimated rate of
vandalism . "
Then there ’s the matter of JCDecaux ’s own self - interest , and whether the rumors and exaggerations will hurt the company ’s attempts to secure bike - share contracts in other cities .
Said Britton : " Why would they run away from a golden goose ? "
Newswise — January is Cervical Cancer Awareness Month and The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center shares important information about the cervical cancer screening exam , the Pap test .
For many women , their annual Pap test is not something to look forward to ; however , this test has the potential to make a huge difference in the lives of women everywhere .
The Pap test detects cell changes , which may cause cervical cancer .
If these cell changes are found and treated early , cervical cancer may be prevented .
Andrea Milbourne , M.D. , associate professor in M. D. Anderson 's Department of Gynecologic
Oncology , explores six facts women should know about this important test .
1. Increased sexual activity equals increased need for a Pap test .
Increased sexual activity raises a woman 's risk for acquiring the human papilloma virus ( HPV ) .
While HPV can be harmless , it also can cause cervical cancer by changing normal cells in the cervix .
" Because condoms do not provide 100 percent protection against HPV , women who are sexually active and not in a monogamous relationship need to be even more vigilant about following cervical cancer screening guidelines , " Milbourne said .
2 . The HPV vaccine is a supplement , not a replacement for the Pap test .
Getting the HPV vaccine , or encouraging young female family members to consider it , is a great first step toward cervical cancer prevention .
That being said , the vaccine is in no way a substitute for the Pap test .
" The vaccine may give women a false sense of security , " Milbourne said .
" And because getting a Pap test is not what most women consider a favorite activity , getting the vaccine might cause them to procrastinate even more to make an appointment for their next Pap test . "
Because the HPV vaccine does not protect against all types of HPV , or other sexually transmitted diseases , it cannot be the only method of cervical cancer prevention .
Women also should remember that cervical cancer does n't have many visible symptoms , which makes the Pap test significantly important in preventing cervical cancer .
3. Women should prepare for an upcoming Pap test .
Milbourne recommends a few tips to help women prepare for an upcoming test : * Avoid douching or using vaginal medicines , spermicidal foams , creams or jellies 48 hours before the test .*
Do not have sexual intercourse 48 hours before the test . *
Reschedule a Pap test appointment if an unexpected heavy menstrual flow occurs on the day of the exam .
" Lubricants , spermicides , douching and sexual activity can interfere with the interpretation of Pap test results , potentially leading to incorrectly interpreted results or the need for repeat tests , " Milbourne said .
4 . A woman is never too old to get her Pap test .
Of all the benefits that might come with growing older , skipping a regular Pap test for a sexually active woman over age 65 is not one of them .
As female life expectancy gets longer , many women continue to enjoy sexually active lives throughout their sixties and into their seventies .
" For women over age 65 , cervical cancer is rare , but it does happen , " Milbourne said .
" If you are over age 65 , sexually active and not in a monogamous relationship , you should continue your annual Pap test , as you are still susceptible to HPV , which can cause cervical cancer . "
5. Women can afford a Pap test .
" Without health insurance or access to affordable health care , a Pap test can be costly , " Milbourne said .
" For women who can not afford a Pap test , there may be places in your community where you can get one for free . "
For information on where to get a free or low - cost Pap test , call the National Cancer Institute 's Cancer Information Service at 1-800-4-CANCER .
Pap tests also are sometimes covered by Medicaid and are covered every two years by Medicare or every year for certain women at higher risk .
For more information , call 1-800 - MEDICARE .
6. Before the Pap test , cervical cancer was a leading cause of death in American women .
The American Cancer Society estimates that about 3,870 women died from cervical cancer in the United States during 2008 .
This number is low compared to annual statistics for other more common cancer types , such as breast or lung cancer , but what most people do not know is that cervical cancer was once one of the most common causes of cancer death in American women .
As the Pap test became a standard test for American women , doctors were able to find abnormal changes in the cervix before cancer developed .
Between 1955 and 1992 , the cervical cancer death rate declined by 74 percent .
" While the cervical cancer death rate continues to decline in the United States , women in countries where Pap tests are not as readily available or affordable still face the challenges , shared by American women more than 50 years ago , " Milbourne said .
Cervical cancer is the second largest cause of female cancer deaths worldwide , according to the World Health Organization , with 288,000 deaths each year .
About 510,000 cases of cervical cancer are reported each year " nearly 80 percent are in developing countries .

Loneliness is as bad for health as smoking or obesity , experts warn
Feeling lonely ' can raise blood pressure , stress and the risk of depression '
Being lonely is as bad for your health as smoking or obesity , experts have warned .
Being cut off from friends and family can raise blood pressure and weaken the immune system , the American Association for the Advancement of Science 's annual conference heard .
It can also make it harder to sleep and even speed the progression of dementia , according to psychologist John Cacioppo .
He found loneliness raises levels of the hormone cortisol and can push blood pressure up into the danger zone for heart attacks and strokes .
Research showed the difference in health between the lonely and the most socially active could be as great as that between smokers and non-smokers and the obese and those of normal weight .
Professor Cacioppo said : ' When time takes its toll on the body , loneliness steepens that slope of descent . '
In his study , the loneliest people had blood pressure readings up to 30 points higher than those with the most active social lives , making them three times more likely to develop heart disease and stroke and twice as likely to die from them as people with normal blood pressure .
High levels of cortisol can also suppress the immune system , raising a person 's vulnerability to disease .
The lonely also sleep more fitfully , feel lethargic during the day and are more likely to rely on sleeping tablets .
Loneliness also has numerous other effects on health , including accelerating the pace of dementia .
It is not clear why this is but it may be their brains lack the suppleness of those who socialise regularly .
When researchers compared the health of people who shut themselves away with from the world with gregarious types they found the difference as great as that between smokers and non-smokers , the obese and the normal weight or those who exercised and those who did n't .
Professor Cacioppo said the phenomenon was hugely relevant in today 's fragmented society , where many people communicate through the internet rather than face - to - face .
The Chicago University researcher said : ' We are increasingly living in isolation .
Partly because we are ageing , also because we are marrying later and having fewer children there are fewer confidantes and levels of loneliness are going up . '
The professor advises the lonely to try making friends through charity work and says it is better to have a few strong friendships than lots of acquaintances .
' Lonely people feel a hunger , ' he said .
' The key is to realise that the solution lies not in being fed but in cooking for and enjoying a meal with others . '
The professor believes the trait has its roots deep in evolution .
Pangs of loneliness likely reminded those who had become isolated with a reminder to rejoin the security of the pack .
Under an Obama administration , some form of broadband stimulus package is coming — and $ 6 billion is already being kicked around as a starting point .
But if you build it , will they come ?
Pew 's Internet & American Life Project reminds us that a hardcore contingent of holdouts wo n't , no matter how cheap or how fast the connection is .
One important component of any broadband stimulus would be availability , with many pundits hoping for a scheme similar to the universal service scheme that wired even rural America for phone service decades ago .
In summing up its recent research on broadband , Pew's Associate Director for Research , John Horrigan , notes that this remains a real concern when it comes to broadband ; one quarter of rural dial - up users , for instance , say that they can't upgrade to broadband because options are n't available .
But when we look at the overall reasons why Americans do n't have broadband , availability is n't the biggest barrier .
Neither is price .
Those two , combined , only account for one - third of Americans without broadband .
Two - thirds simply do n't want it .
What 's the point ?
The bigger issue is a lack of perceived value .
19 percent of dial - up users , for example , say that " nothing " would get them to upgrade , not even lower prices .
Of the 25 percent of Americans that do n't regularly use the Internet at all ( Hi , Mom ! ) , a third said that they were " not interested in going online , " almost ten percent thought it was too " difficult , " and seven percent simply do n't " have time . "
Older and poorer Americans tend to be the ones who see less need for broadband , and it 's clear that demand for it could be boosted through national e-health and e-government programs .
But Pew 's main point is that working on price and access alone will only bring broadband to a limited subset of Americans who do n't already have it — in the short term , at least .
Those who have broadband tend to want more of it .
US speeds lag behind those of some other countries ( I spoke with a Swede this morning who described the 10 M bps symmetric connection he had to his apartment ... back in 1998 ) , and Americans have a taste for high - speed networks .
Pew says that " one - third of existing broadband subscribers are low - hanging fruit to adopt faster broadband soon after it is available , " and many others would upgrade their speed tiers in time .
This fits with the other major element of most broadband plans proposed so far : massive upgrades in existing capacity , usually envisaged as fiber to the home .
Certainly , a $ 6 billion stimulus will do little or nothing at this level ( Verizon will spend around $ 20 billion just on its own FiOS system ) , but the Obama folks have already made it clear that a separate broadband package is being worked out .

As news came out of the Senate Judiciary Committee 's approval of Attorney General Nominee Eric Holder , sending his nomination to the full Senate , reports came out of a possible agreement struck between Holder and various Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee .
One of those reports , detailed here in the Washington Times , http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/jan/28/exclusive-holder-assures-gop-torture-prosecution/ , suggests a deal that could be described by some ugly terms .
According to the Times :
Eric H. Holder Jr.'s confirmation as attorney general is speeding toward approval thanks in part to his private assurances to a key Republican senator that he does not intend to prosecute intelligence agency interrogators for their actions during the prior administration .
The assurances , reported by Sen. Christopher S. Bond , Missouri Republican , to The Washington Times on Wednesday , went beyond Mr. Holder 's earlier public testimony in which he said he could not prejudge his actions regarding cases he had not seen .
" I believe [ Mr. Holder ] will look forward to keep the nation safe and not look backwards to prosecute intelligence operators who were fighting terror and kept our country safe since 9/11 , " Mr. Bond said in the interview .
-------------
A Holder Aide denied that any such deal had been made .
As reported in Talking Points Memo here http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/01/holder-aide-we-made-no-special-promises-to-bond.php as well as the above Washington Times article , the aide said :
" Eric Holder has not made any commitments about who would or would not be prosecuted , " the aide said via e-mail .
" He explained his position to Senator Bond as he did in the public hearing and in his responses to written questions . "
The aide pointed to Holder 's written response to a question from Sen. Jon Kyl ( R - AZ ) : Prosecutorial and investigative judgments must depend on the facts , and no one is above the law .
But where it is clear that a government agent has acted in " reasonable and good - faith reliance on Justice Department legal opinions " authoritatively permitting his conduct , I would find it difficult to justify commencing a full - blown criminal investigation , let alone a prosecution .
--------------
The Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee including Senator Bond had better hope that no such deal has been struck .
A deal that was made under the threat of withholding something from Mr. Holder ( approval of his nomination ) unless he agreed not to prosecute a crime could be construed as Extortion and Obstruction of Justice .
Since this Extortion and Obstruction of Justice would deal with prior bad acts ( Torture and crimes against humanity ) by other members of the same group , in this case , Republicans ( in the Bush administration ) and those to whom they gave orders , one could then assert that the GOP is an ongoing criminal organization and seek to prosecute those involved under RICO , the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act .
This is easier understood if paraphrased .
If a member of a mafia crime family went to a district attorney who is applying for membership to a country club and says he will help him get into that country club if he refuses to prosecute a member of that crime family for an unrelated crime otherwise he will block his membership , that is bribery , extortion and obstruction of justice and would also potentially lead to RICO indictments .
RICO has been applied very liberally since it was passed and according to how it reads in the Cornell University Law School site ,
http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sup_01_18_10_I_20_96.html would seem to encompass what is suggested to have transpired here .
One of the reasons RICO was passed was to allow prosecutors to go after powerful organizations that commit crimes and then use threats and influence peddling to prevent those crimes from being prosecuted .
That is exactly what we have here .

Just take a close look at the last hour of trading — at precisely one hour before close the markets were massively pumped .
Before moving on to the main topic allow me to point out that Timmy Geitner ( our new Treasury Secretary ) wasted no time getting up to speed as the new ring - leader for the Plunge Protection Team ( PPT ) .
As you can see in the DOW chart below , the PPT fingerprints were all over the markets yesterday …

Is this 1930 all over again ?
The Great Depression started with the stock market crash of 1929 , but the markets did n’t bottom out until 1933 .
Along the way there were several major rallies , yet the overall trend was bearish in nature and new lows were periodically made after these bear market rallies faltered .
Anyway , much like today – where many " experts " advise that the markets are ripe for a re-entry point and our economy will soon turn around – pundits and leaders of the depression era were consistently telling folks " The Bottom is in " …
Those who took this " expert " advice did so at their own peril – and ultimately most were creamed as the markets continued to fall into the abyss for several years .
Allow me to share a few quotes from the Depression Era :
" We will not have any more crashes in our time . " – John Maynard Keynes , 1927
" There will be no interruption of our permanent prosperity . " – Myron E. Forbes , President , Pierce Arrow Motor Car Co. , January 12 , 1928

– Irving Fisher , Ph.D. in economics , Oct. 17 , 1929

"
– New York Times , October 14 , 1929
" This crash is not going to have much effect on business . " – Arthur Reynolds , Chairman of Continental Illinois Bank of Chicago , October 24 , 1929
" … despite its severity , we believe that the slump in stock prices will prove an intermediate movement and not the precursor of a business depression … " – Harvard Economic Society ( HES ) , November 2 , 1929
" The Government ’s business is in sound condition . " – Andrew W. Mellon , Secretary of the Treasury , December 5 , 1929

" The spring of 1930 marks the end of a period of grave concern …
American business is steadily coming back to a normal level of prosperity . " – Julius Barnes , head of Hoover ’s National Business Survey Conference , Mar 16 , 1930
" While the crash only took place six months ago , I am convinced we have now passed the worst and with continued unity of effort we shall rapidly recover .
There is one certainty of the future of a people of the resources , intelligence and character of the people of the United States – that is , prosperity . "
– President Hoover , May 1 , 1930

" All safe deposit boxes in banks or financial institutions have been sealed … and may only be opened in the presence of an agent of the I.R.S. " – President F.D. Roosevelt , 1933
Lets compare those quotes to some made over the past few years :

I am . " President Bush at the Robinson Helicopter Co. in Torrance , Calif , Jan 30 , 2008
" Losing a job is painful , and I know Americans are concerned about our economy ; so am I .

" The worst is likely to be behind us , " - Henry Paulson , US Treasury Secretary , May 7th , 2008
" These institutions [ Fannie and Freddie ] are fundamentally sound and strong .
There is no reason for the kind of [ stock market ] reaction we ’re getting . "
– Christopher Dodd , Chair , Senate Banking Committee , Financial Post , July 12 , 2008
“ My first instinct was to let the market work , until I realized , being briefed by experts …
It turns out that there ’s a lot of interlinks through the financial system . ” – President George W. Bush on $ 700B Treasury Department bailout plan , Sept 2008
" We think that 2009 is likely to be better than 2008 . " – Richard Bernstein , Chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch , Dec 2008
" I definitely think the market is nearing the bottom " – financial writer Lita Epstein — also the author of " The Pocket Idiot ’s Guide to Investing in Mutual Funds , 12 Feb 2009 .
Closing :
I believe we ’re merely at the beginning of this tectonic economic crisis – a parallel 1930 if you will , but with it – a massive transformation will take place – a paradigm shift that we may NEVER fully recover from .
What do I mean ?
Currently we are undergoing a lack of trust between banks , people and government .
As this crisis unfolds , the masses will awaken and realize they also can no longer trust Wall Street , their 401K ’s , their Currency , Social Security , Gvt Promises etc …
People will eventually stop using banks , will stop investing in the markets , will flock to tangibles , will stop paying their fair taxes , will hoard food / essentials and use barter – as the country turns more " Darwinian " and barter becomes far more mainstream …
Bottom Line :
Yes , as far as time lines go , I believe this is 1930 all over again , but the outcome will likely be far more precarious …
I honestly feel that Wall Street and our banking systems are DEAD – but they just do n’t realize ( or if they do ) believe it yet .
Once the masses awaken and these two entities are placed 6 - feet under , our corrupt political leaders ( with no one to kowtow to ) will quickly learn that they must significantly change their ways and once again become a government of the people , by the people , and for the people – else the masses will DEMAND this change with anger , pitchforks , rope and very , very little sympathy .

In 2003 , Herb Sutter exposed the industry 's biggest " dirty little secret " with his " The Free Lunch Is Over " article , demonstrating clearly that the era of ever - faster processors was at an end , to be replaced by a new era of parallelism via " cores " ( virtual CPUs ) on a single chip .
The revelation sent shockwaves through the programming community because getting thread - safe code correct has always remained , in theory if not in practice , the province of high - powered software developers way too expensive for your company to hire .
A privileged few , it seemed , understood enough about Java 's threading model and concurrency APIs and " synchronized " keyword to write code that both provided safety and throughput ... and most of those had learned it the hard way .
It is presumed that the rest of the industry was left to fend for itself , clearly not a desirable conclusion , at least not to the IT departments paying for that software being developed .
About this series Ted Neward dives into the Scala programming language and takes you along with him .
In this new developerWorks series , you 'll learn what all the recent hype is about and see some of Scala 's linguistic capabilities in action .
Scala code and Java code will be shown side by side wherever comparison is relevant , but ( as you 'll discover ) many things in Scala have no direct correlation to anything you 've found in Java — and therein lies much of Scala 's charm !
After all , if Java could do it , why bother learning Scala ?
Like Scala 's sister language in the .NET space , F# , Scala stands as one of several purported solutions to the " concurrency problem . "
In this column , I have touched on several of Scala 's properties that make it more amenable to writing thread - safe code such as immutable objects by default and a design preference for returning copies of objects rather than modifying their contents .
Scala 's support for concurrency reaches far deeper than just this though ; it 's high time to start poking around in the Scala libraries to see what lives there .
Back - to - concurrency basics
Before we can get too deep into Scala 's concurrency support , it 's a good idea to make sure that you have a good understanding of Java 's basic concurrency model because Scala 's support for concurrency builds , at some level , on top of the features and functionality provided by the JVM and supporting libraries .
Toward that end , the code in Listing 1 contains a basic concurrency problem known as the Producer / Consumer problem ( as described in the " Guarded Blocks " section of the Sun Java Tutorial ) .
Note that the Java Tutorial version does n't use the java.util.concurrent classes in its solution , preferring instead to use the old wait ( ) / notifyAll ( ) methods from java.lang .
Object :
Listing 1 . Producer / Consumer ( pre-Java5 )
package com.tedneward.scalaexamples.notj5 ; class Producer implements Runnable { private Drop drop ; private String importantInfo [ ] = { " Mares eat oats " , " Does eat oats " , " Little lambs eat ivy " , " A kid will eat ivy too " } ; public Producer ( Drop drop ) { this .
drop = drop ; } public void run ( ) { for ( int i = 0 ; i < importantInfo.length ; i++) { drop.put( importantInfo[i ] ) ; } drop.put ( " DONE " ) ; } } class Consumer implements Runnable { private Drop drop ; public Consumer ( Drop drop ) { this .drop = drop ; } public void run ( ) { for ( String message = drop.take ( ) ; !message.equals ( " DONE " ) ; message = drop. take ( ) ) { System.out.format( " MESSAGE RECEIVED : %s%n " , message ) ; } } } class Drop { // Message sent from producer to consumer .
private String message ; // True if consumer should wait for producer to send message , // false if producer should wait for consumer to retrieve message .
private boolean empty = true ; // Object to use to synchronize against so as to not " leak " the //" this " monitor private Object lock = new Object ( ) ; public String take ( ) { synchronized ( lock ) { // Wait until message is available .
while ( empty ) { try { lock .
wait ( ) ; } catch ( InterruptedException e ) {} } // Toggle status .
empty = true ; // Notify producer that status has changed .
lock.notifyAll( ) ; return message ; } } public void put( String message ) { synchronized ( lock ) { // Wait until message has been retrieved .
while ( ! empty ) { try { lock .
wait ( ) ; } catch ( InterruptedException e ) {} } // Toggle status .
empty = false ; // Store message .
this .
message = message ; // Notify consumer that status has changed .
lock.notifyAll( ) ; } } } public class ProdConSample { public static void main ( String [ ] args ) { Drop drop = new Drop ( ) ; ( new Thread ( new Producer ( drop ) ) ) . start ( ) ; ( new Thread ( new Consumer ( drop ) ) ) . start ( ) ; } }
The Java Tutorial " bug " Curious readers will probably go and compare this code against that found in the Java Tutorial to see what the difference is ; those who do will discover that instead of simply " synchronized " - ing the put and take methods , I 've instead used a lock object stored inside the Drop .
The reason for this is simple :
The monitor of an object is never encapsulated inside of the class , so as written the Java Tutorial version allows this ( obviously insane ) code to break it :
public class ProdConSample
{
public static void main ( String [ ] args )
{
Drop drop = new Drop ( ) ;
( new Thread ( new Producer ( drop ) ) ) . start ( ) ;
( new Thread ( new Consumer ( drop ) ) ) . start ( ) ;
synchronized ( drop )
{
Thread.sleep(60 * 60 * 24 * 365 * 10 ) ; // sleep for 10 years ?!?
}
}
} By using a private object as the monitor on which the lock is based , this code will have no effect .
In essence , now the thread - safety implementation is encapsulated ; before it relied on client goodwill to work correctly .
Note :
The code I present here is slightly modified from the Sun tutorial solution ; there 's a small design flaw in the code they present ( see The Java Tutorial " bug " ) .
The core of the Producer / Consumer problem is a simple one to understand : one ( or more ) producer entities want to provide data for one ( or more ) consumer entities to consume and do something with ( in this case it consists of printing the data to the console ) .
The Producer and Consumer classes are pretty straightforward Runnable - implementing classes : The Producer takes String s from an array and put s them into a buffer for the Consumer to take as desired .
The hard part of the problem is that if the Producer runs too fast , data will be potentially lost as it is overwritten ; if the Consumer runs too fast , data will be potentially double - processed as the Consumer reads the same data twice .
The buffer ( called the Drop in the Java Tutorial code ) must ensure that neither condition occurs .
Not to mention that there is no potential for data corruption ( hard in the case of String references , but still a concern ) as messages are put in and take n out of the buffer .
A full discussion of the subject is best left to Brian Goetz 's Java Concurrency in Practice or Doug Lea 's earlier Concurrent Programming in Java ( see Related topics ) , but a quick rundown of how this code works is necessary before you apply Scala to it .
When the Java compiler sees the synchronized keyword , it generates a try / finally block in place of the synchronized block with a monitorenter opcode at the top of the block and a monitorexit opcode in the finally block to ensure that the monitor ( the Java basis for atomicity ) is released regardless of how the code exits .
Thus , the put code in Drop gets rewritten to look like Listing 2 :
Listing 2 . Drop.put after compiler helpfulness
// This is pseudocode public void put( String message ) { try { monitorenter ( lock ) // Wait until message has been retrieved .
while ( ! empty ) { try { lock .
wait ( ) ; } catch ( InterruptedException e ) {} } // Toggle status .
empty = false ; // Store message .
this .
message = message ; // Notify consumer that status has changed .
lock.notifyAll( ) ; } finally { monitorexit ( lock ) } }
The wait ( ) method tells the current thread to go into an inactive state and wait for another thread to call notify All ( ) on that object .
The thread just notified must then attempt to acquire the monitor again after which point it is free to continue execution .
In essence , wait ( ) and notify ( ) / notifyAll ( ) act as a simple signaling mechanism , allowing the Drop to coordinate between the Producer and the Consumer threads , one take to each put .
The code download that accompanies this article uses the Java5 concurrency enhancements ( the Lock and Condition interfaces and the ReentrantLock lock implementation ) to provide timeout - based versions of Listing 2 , but the basic code pattern remains the same .
That is the problem : Developers who write code like in Listing 2 have to focus too exclusively on the details , the low - level implementation code , of the threading and locking required to make it all work correctly .
What 's more , developers have to reason about each and every line in the code , looking to see if it needs to be protected because too much synchronization is just as bad as too little .
Now let 's look at Scala alternatives .
Good old Scala concurrency ( v1 )
One way to start working with concurrency in Scala is to simply translate the Java code directly over to Scala , taking advantage of Scala 's syntax in places to simplify the code , a least a little :
Listing 3 . ProdConSample ( Scala )
object ProdConSample { class Producer ( drop : Drop ) extends Runnable { val importantInfo : Array [ String ] = Array ( " Mares eat oats " , " Does eat oats " , " Little lambs eat ivy " , " A kid will eat ivy too " ) ; override def run ( ) : Unit = { importantInfo.foreach ( ( msg ) => drop.put( msg ) ) drop.put ( " DONE " ) } } class Consumer ( drop : Drop ) extends Runnable { override def run ( ) :
Unit = { var message = drop. take ( ) while ( message != " DONE " ) { System.out.format( " MESSAGE RECEIVED : %s%n " , message ) message = drop. take ( ) } } } class Drop { var message : String = " " var empty : Boolean = true var lock : AnyRef = new Object ( ) def put( x : String ) :
Unit = lock .synchronized { //
Wait until message has been retrieved await ( empty == true ) //
Toggle status empty = false //
Store message message = x // Notify consumer that status has changed lock.notifyAll ( ) } def take ( ) :
String = lock .synchronized { //
Wait until message is available .
await ( empty == false ) //
Toggle status empty=true //
Notify producer that staus has changed lock.notifyAll ( ) //
Return the message message } private def await ( cond : => Boolean ) = while ( ! cond ) { lock .
wait ( ) } } def main ( args : Array [ String ] ) : Unit = { // Create Drop val drop = new Drop ( ) ; // Spawn Producer new Thread ( new Producer ( drop ) ) .start ( ) ; // Spawn Consumer new Thread ( new Consumer ( drop ) ) . start ( ) ; } }
The Producer and Consumer classes are almost identical to their Java cousins , again extending ( implementing ) the Runnable interface and overriding the run ( ) method , and — in Producer 's case — using the built - in iteration method for each to walk the contents of the importantInfo array .
( Actually , to make it more like Scala , importantInfo should probably be a List instead of an Array , but in this first pass , I want to keep things as close to the original Java code as possible . )
The Drop class also looks similar to the Java version except that in Scala , " synchronized " is n't a keyword , it 's a method defined on the class AnyRef , the Scala " root of all reference types . "
This means that to synchronize on a particular object , you simply call the synchronize method on that object ; in this case , on the object held in the lock field on Drop .
Note that we also make use of a Scala-ism in the Drop class in the definition of the await ( ) method :
The cond parameter is a block of code waiting to be evaluated rather than evaluated prior to being passed in to the method .
Formally in Scala , this is known as " call - by - name " ; here it serves as a useful way of capturing the conditional - waiting logic that had to be repeated twice ( once in put , once in take ) in the Java version .
Finally , in main ( ) , you create the Drop instance , instantiate two threads , kick them off with start ( ) , and then simply fall off of the end of main ( ) , trusting that the JVM will have started those two threads before you finish with main ( ) .
( In production code , this probably should n't be taken for granted , but for a simple example like this , it 's going to be OK 99.99 percent of the time .
Caveat emptor . )
However , having said all that , the same basic problem remains : Programmers still have to worry way too much about the issues of signaling and coordinating the two threads .
While some of the Scala - isms might make the syntax easier to live with , it 's not really an incredibly compelling win so far .
Scala concurrency , v2
A quick look at the Scala Library Reference reveals an interesting package : scala.concurrency .
This package contains a number of different concurrency constructs , including the first one we 're going to make use of , the MailBox class .
As its name implies , MailBox is essentially the Drop by itself , a single - slot buffer that holds a piece of data until it has been retrieved .
However , the big advantage of MailBox is that it completely encapsulates the details of the sending and receiving behind a combination of pattern - matching and case classes , making it more flexible than the simple Drop ( or the Drop 's big multi- slot data - holding brother , java.util.concurrent.BoundedBuffer ) .
Listing 4 . ProdConSample , v2 ( Scala )
package com.tedneward.scalaexamples.scala.V2
{ import concurrent .
{MailBox , ops} object ProdConSample { class Producer ( drop : Drop ) extends Runnable { val importantInfo : Array [ String ] = Array ( " Mares eat oats " , " Does eat oats " , " Little lambs eat ivy " , " A kid will eat ivy too " ) ; override def run ( ) : Unit = { importantInfo.foreach ( ( msg ) => drop.put( msg ) ) drop.put ( " DONE " ) } } class Consumer ( drop : Drop ) extends Runnable { override def run ( ) :
Unit = { var message = drop. take ( ) while ( message != " DONE " ) { System.out.format( " MESSAGE RECEIVED : %s%n " , message ) message = drop. take ( ) } } } class Drop { private val m = new MailBox ( ) private case class Empty ( ) private case class Full( x : String ) m send Empty ( ) // initialization def put( msg : String ) : Unit = { m receive { case Empty ( ) => m send Full ( msg ) } } def take ( ) : String = { m receive { case Full ( msg ) => m send Empty ( ) ; msg } } } def main ( args : Array [ String ] ) : Unit = { // Create Drop val drop = new Drop( ) // Spawn Producer new Thread ( new Producer ( drop ) ) .start ( ) ; // Spawn Consumer new Thread ( new Consumer ( drop ) ) . start ( ) ; } } }
The only difference here between v2 and v1 is in the implementation of Drop , which now makes use of the MailBox class to handle the blocking and signaling of messages coming in and being removed from the Drop .
( We could have rewritten Producer and Consumer to use the MailBox directly , but for simplicity 's sake , I assume that we want to keep the Drop API consistent across all the examples . )
Using a MailBox is a bit different from the classic BoundedBuffer ( Drop ) that we 've been using , so let 's walk through that code in detail .
MailBox has two basic operations : send and receive .
The receiveWithin method is simply a timeout - based version of receive .
MailBox takes messages that can be of any type whatsoever .
The send ( ) method essentially drops the message into the mailbox , notifying any pending receivers immediately if it's of a type they care about , and appending it to a linked list of messages for later retrieval .
The receive ( ) method blocks until a message appropriate to the function block that 's passed in to it is received .
Therefore , in this situation , we create two case classes , one containing nothing ( Empty ) that indicates the MailBox is empty and one containing the data ( Full ) with the message data in it .
The put method , because it is putting data into the Drop , calls receive ( ) on the MailBox looking for an Empty instance , thus blocking until Empty has been sent .
At this point , it sends a Full instance to the MailBox containing the new data .
method , because it is putting data into the , calls on the looking for an instance , thus blocking until has been sent .
At this point , it sends a instance to the containing the new data .
The take method , because it is removing data from the Drop , calls receive ( ) on the MailBox looking for a Full instance , extracts the message ( again thanks to pattern - matching 's ability to extract values from inside the case class and bind them to local variables ) , and sends an Empty instance to the MailBox .
No explicit locking required , and no thinking about monitors .
Scala concurrency , v3
In fact , we can shorten the code up considerably if it turns out that Producer and Consumer do n't really have to be full - fledged classes at all ( which is the case here ) — both are essentially thin wrappers around the Runnable.run ( ) method , which Scala can do away with entirely by using the scala.concurrent.ops object 's spawn method , like in Listing 5 :
Listing 5 . ProdConSample , v3 ( Scala )
package com.tedneward.scalaexamples.scala.V3 { import concurrent .MailBox import concurrent.ops ._ object ProdConSample { class Drop { private val m = new MailBox ( ) private case class Empty ( ) private case class Full( x : String ) m send Empty ( ) // initialization def put( msg : String ) : Unit = { m receive { case Empty ( ) => m send Full ( msg ) } } def take ( ) : String = { m receive { case Full ( msg ) => m send Empty ( ) ; msg } } } def main ( args : Array [ String ] ) : Unit = { // Create Drop val drop = new Drop ( ) // Spawn Producer spawn { val importantInfo : Array [ String ] = Array ( " Mares eat oats " , " Does eat oats " , " Little lambs eat ivy " , " A kid will eat ivy too " ) ; importantInfo.foreach(( msg ) => drop.put( msg ) ) drop.put ( " DONE " ) } // Spawn Consumer spawn { var message = drop. take ( ) while ( message != " DONE " ) { System.out.format( " MESSAGE RECEIVED : %s%n " , message ) message = drop. take ( ) } } } } }
The spawn method ( imported via the ops object just at the top of the package block ) takes a block of code ( another by - name parameter example ) and wraps it inside the run ( ) method of an anonymously - constructed thread object .
In fact , it 's not too difficult to understand what spawn 's definition looks like inside of the ops class :
Listing 6 . scala.concurrent.ops.spawn ( )
def spawn ( p : => Unit ) = { val t = new Thread ( ) { override def run ( ) = p } t.start ( ) }
... which once again highlights the power of by - name parameters .
One drawback to the ops. spawn method is the basic fact that it was written in 2003 before the Java 5 concurrency classes had taken effect .
In particular , the java.util.concurrent .
Executor and its ilk were created to make things easier for developers to spawn threads without having to actually handle the details of creating thread objects directly .
Fortunately , spawn 's definition is simple enough to recreate in a custom library of your own , making use of Executor ( or ExecutorService or ScheduledExecutorService ) to do the actual launching of the thread .
In fact , Scala 's support for concurrency goes well beyond the MailBox and ops classes ; Scala also supports a similar concept called " Actors , " which uses a similar kind of message - passing approach that the MailBox uses , but to a much greater degree and with much more flexibility .
But that 's for next time .
Conclusion
Scala provides two levels of support for concurrency , much as it does for other Java - related topics :
The first , full access to the underlying libraries ( such as java.util.concurrent ) and support for the " traditional " Java concurrency semantics ( such as monitors and wait ( ) / notifyAll ( ) ) .
/ ) .
The second , a layer of abstraction on top of those basic mechanics , as exemplified by the MailBox class discussed in this article and the Actors library that we 'll discuss in the next article in the series .
The goal is the same in both cases : to make it easier for developers to focus on the meat of the problem rather than having to think about the low - level details of concurrent programming ( obviously the second approach achieves that better than the first , at least to those who are n't too deeply invested in thinking at the low - level primitives level ) .
One clear deficiency to the current Scala libraries , however , is the obvious lack of Java 5 support ; the scala.concurrent.ops class should have operations like spawn that make use of the new Executor interfaces .
It should also support versions of synchronized that make use of the new Lock interfaces .
Fortunately , these are all library improvements that can be done at any point during Scala 's life cycle without breaking existing code ; they can even be done by Scala developers themselves without having to wait for Scala 's core development team to provide it to them ( all it takes is a little time ) .

Bernanke has fired yet another misguided missile to stabilize the banking system .
His new program is called the Capital Assistance Program and supposedly it will restore confidence in banks and get them to lend .
Here is a description of the program :
The purpose of the CAP is to restore confidence throughout the financial system that the nation 's largest banking institutions have a sufficient capital cushion against larger than expected future losses , should they occur due to a more severe economic environment , and to support lending to creditworthy borrowers .
Terms
Capital provided under the CAP will be in the form of a preferred security that is convertible into common equity at a 10 percent discount to the price prevailing prior to February 9th .
CAP securities will carry a 9 percent dividend yield and would be convertible at the issuer 's option ( subject to the approval of their regulator ) .
After 7 years , the security would automatically convert into common equity if not redeemed or converted before that date .
The instrument is designed to give banks the incentive to replace USG - provided capital with private capital or to redeem the USG capital when conditions permit .
With supervisory approval , banks will be able to request capital under the CAP in addition to their existing CPP preferred stock .
With supervisory approval , banks will also be allowed to apply to exchange the existing CPP preferred stock for the new CAP instrument .
CAP Facts
Conversion price is 90 % of the average closing price for the common stock for the 20 trading day period ending February 9 , 2009 .

Citi Near Deal to Boost U.S. Stake to as Much as 40 %
Citigroup Inc. may announce a deal with the U.S. as soon as tomorrow that could raise the government 's stake to as much as 40 percent , the Wall Street Journal reported , citing unidentified people familiar with the matter .
The deal may cause Citigroup to sell part of the company 's stake in Grupo Financiero Banamex , the Mexican bank , because Mexico prohibits companies with a more than 10 percent ownership by a foreign government from running a bank in Mexico , the newspaper said .

Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said while the U.S. government may take “ substantial ” stakes in Citigroup Inc. and other banks , it does n’t plan a full - scale nationalization that wipes out stockholders .
Nationalization is when the government “ seizes ” a company , “ zeroes out the shareholders and begins to manage and run the bank , and we do n’t plan anything like that , ” Bernanke told lawmakers in Washington today .
In the case of Citigroup Inc. , the government may end up with a “ substantial ” share of the lender ’s stock , he said .
Oversight of the company would be accomplished through regulators and by exerting “ shareholder rights , ” Bernanke said .
The Treasury Department , Federal Reserve and other banking regulators said in a joint statement on Feb. 23 that they stood ready to pump more capital into banks , or convert some of the government ’s outstanding preferred shares into common , to prevent their failures .
The stress tests are scheduled to begin today , according to that statement .
“ We will see how their test works out , and we will see what evolves , ” Bernanke said .
“ If in fact they have to convert even the existing preferred into common , then there could be a more substantial share of ownership of Citi by the U.S. government . ”
Mysterious Plans
I ’m trying to be sympathetic to the various plans , or rumors of plans , for bank aid ; but I keep not being able to understand either what the plans are , or why they ’re supposed to work .
And I do n’t think it ’s me .
So the latest is that we ’re going to convert preferred stock held by the government to common stock , maybe .
Here ’s my stylized picture of the situation :
What Treasury now seems to be proposing is converting some of the green equity to blue equity — converting preferred to common .
It ’s true that preferred stock has some debt - like qualities — there are required dividend payments , etc. .
But does anyone think that the reason banks are crippled is that they are tied down by their obligations to preferred stockholders , as opposed to having too much plain vanilla debt ?
I just do n’t get it .
And my sinking feeling that the administration plan is to rearrange the deck chairs and hope the iceberg melts just keeps getting stronger .
Tangible Common Equity for Beginners
The initial government investments in Citigroup , back in October and November , were in the form of preferred shares .
Between the two bailouts , the government put in $ 45 billion in cash and got $ 52 billion in preferred stock ( the $ 7 billion difference was the fee for the guarantee on $ 300 billion of Citi assets ) .
That preferred stock was designed to be much closer to debt than to equity : it pays a dividend ( 5 % or 8 % ) , it can not be converted into common stock ( so it cannot dilute the existing shareholders ) , it has no voting rights , and it carries a penalty if it is n’t bought back within five years .
In fact , it is hard to distinguish from debt , except perhaps for the fact that , if Citi defaults on it ( cannot buy the shares back ) we do n’t need to worry about systemic instability , because the government can absorb the loss .
As preferred stock , these bailouts boosted Citi ’s Tier 1 capital , but not its TCE .
Because of the newly perceived need for TCE , the bailout plan under discussion is to convert some of the preferred stock into common stock .
Citi would n’t actually get any new cash from the government , but it would be relieved some of the dividend payments ( currently close to $ 3 billion per year ) , and of the obligation to buy back the shares in five years .
The trick is deciding what price to convert the shares at .
All of Citi ’s common shares today are worth around $ 12 billion , so if you converted $ 52 billion of preferred shares into common , the government would suddenly own over 80 % of Citi .
( In the conversion , you divide the value of the preferred stock you are converting by the price of the common stock , and that yields the number of common shares the government now owns . )
The Geithner team is still continuing the Paulson policy of avoiding anything that looks like nationalization , so the talk is that the government ownership will be capped at 40 % ; that means the government could only convert about $ 8 billion of its preferred stock .
There will probably be some clever manipulation of the numbers to say that the preferred stock is actually worth less than $ 52 billion , or that it should be converted at a higher price than the current market price of the stock .
( This seems like a blatant subsidy to me , since new investors buying large blocks of stock in a public company typically pay less than the current market price . )
There is also talk of trying to get some of Citi ’s other preferred stock holders to convert as well , because the more they convert , the more common shares , and hence the more the government can have without going over the 40 % limit .
The Amazing , Shape - Shifting Convertible Preferred
I have been asked whether there was anything in Chairman Bernanke ’s speech yesterday that changed my outlook on the prospects of nationalization for some of our largest financial institutions .
In a word : “ No . ”
Knowing that there are teams of professionals on Wall Street dedicated to giving new hybrid securities cute names , let me suggest that the government henceforth refer to these incremental investments as “ Maybetorily ” Convertible Preferreds - as in , maybe they 're straight preferred stock , maybe they 're common stock , maybe they 're gone altogether - it all depends on how bad the economy gets from here .
How these Maybetorily Convertible securities can in any way provide the impetus for further private - sector investment into the common stock of our banking system confounds me .
As I see it , if implemented , existing common shareholders have at best the same upside they previously had , with exponentially larger downside .
So rather than throwing the frogs ( banks ) into nationalizing boiling water immediately , the government is going to place them in a tepid bath and watch , suggesting , at least this week , that while they may have to turn up the temperature a little bit ( “ temporarily ” ) , no one will ultimately get burned .
Maybe , maybe not .
The Romanian ethical hacking outfit HackersBlog shames yet another antivirus vendor – Symantec .
A SQL injection vulnerability in a section of the Symantec website allows unauthorized access to the database .
Symantec is one of the biggest IT security companies in the world , developing a wide range of products for both home and enterprise consumers .
It is a veteran on the antivirus market , its flagship product being Norton Antivirus .
According to “ unu , ” a Romanian hacker associated with HackersBlog , the Document Download Centre section of the Symantec website contains a poorly - sanitized parameter , which facilitates SQL injection attacks .
Successful exploitation results in giving an attacker access to the database .
“ The irony of the situation is that it ’s done on https , on a login page , a page that promotes security products like Norton AntiVirus 2009 and Norton Internet SECURITY , ” the hacker , who does n't specify what sensitive information , if any , is stored in that particular database , notes .
The documented attack is actually a “ blind ” SQL injection .
As opposed to regular SQL injections , such attacks are harder to instrument , because the website does not respond back with useful error information that would give the hacker an idea of how to proceed .
According to the few items of information “ unu ” has provided , the website runs on an Apache Web server with PHP 5.2.6 and a MySQL 5.0.22 backend .
The published screenshots demonstrate how executing SQL commands through URL manipulation alters the content of the page .
“ Unu ” claims to have contacted Symantec regarding the problem , or at least attempted to . “ [...]
On the website there is no contact email address for cases such as this , I ’ve sent an email to webmaster@symantec.com and security@symantec.com .
The email did n’t bounce , so someone must have received it .
No answer as of yet , ” he writes , while pointing out that more detailed info could be revealed after the company fixes the issue .
During the past two weeks , hackers from the HackersBlog crew have been disclosing various SQL injection vulnerabilities on websites belonging to no less than four antivirus vendors : Kaspersky , F - Secure , Bitdefender , and now Symantec .
The site operated by the Bitdefender business partner in Portugal has also been compromised by the same group through SQL injection .
Antivirus vendors are not the only targets of the Romanian group of hackers .
Yahoo !
has also made the subject of attacks from them more than once , while “ unu ” has just recently disclosed a similar vulnerability on the website of the International Herald Tribune , the global edition of the New York Times .

On the heels of Ben 's article about the manifest insanity of Bobby Jindal ( or as he should be known , Jobby Bindal ) today 's NY Times has a great article describing the increasing distance between the still - rural , white South , and the rest of the very urban and diverse nation .
There are some seriously ignorant and foolish people out there .
Apparently his Muslim name is " unsettling " .
It seems there are some who think his election will , somehow , justify violent " outbreaks " and aggressive behavior on the part of Black people ( wtf ? ) .
And it is also , according to one genius governmental employee named Don Dollar ( seriously ) , un-Christian to vote for Obama .
What a dick .

Now I get that they are scared of a changing world in which their assumptions no longer hold true .
They want to continue the way things were .
They do n't realize that the change has already happened and Obama is merely its manifestation , and not its progenitor .
Empathy aside , there are a lot of people out there just as crazy as Jindal .
And getting it seems like everyday planet Nuthouse and planet Earth get farther and farther apart .
Here are a few choice wingnut tidbits ( from the NYT ) :
" Race was a strong subtext in post- election conversations across the
socioeconomic spectrum here in Vernon , the small , struggling seat of

One white woman said she feared that blacks would now become more
“ aggressive , ” while another volunteered that she was bothered by the
idea of a black man “ over me ” in the White House .
Mr. McCain won 76 percent of the county ’s vote , about five
percentage points more than Mr. Bush did , because “ a lot more people
came out , hoping to keep Obama out , ” Joey Franks , a construction
worker , said in the parking lot of the Shop and Save .
Mr. Franks , who voted for Mr. McCain , said he believed that “ over 50
percent voted against Obama for racial reasons , ” adding that in his own
case race mattered “ a little bit .
That ’s in my mind . ”
Many people made it clear that they were deeply apprehensive about Mr. Obama , though some said they were hoping for the best .
“ I think any time you have someone elected president of the United
States with a Muslim name , whether they are white or black , there are
some very unsettling things , ” George W. Newman , a director at a local
bank and the former owner of a trucking business , said over lunch at
Yellow Creek Fish and Steak .
Don Dollar , the administrative assistant at City Hall , said bitterly
that anyone not upset with Mr. Obama ’s victory should seek religious
forgiveness .
“ This is a community that ’s supposed to be filled with a bunch of
Christian folks , ” he said .
“ If they ’re not disappointed , they need to
be at the altar . ”
Customers of Bill Pennington , a barber whose downtown shop is
decorated with hunting and fishing trophies , were “ scared because they
heard he had a Muslim background , ” Mr. Pennington said over the country
music on the radio .
“ Over and over again I heard that . ”
Mr. Obama remains an unknown quantity in this corner of the South , and there are deep worries about the changes he will bring .
“ I am concerned , ” Gail McDaniel , who owns a cosmetics business , said
in the parking lot of the Shop and Save .
“ The abortion thing bothers
me . Same - sex marriage . ”
“ I think there are going to be outbreaks from blacks , ” she added .
“ From where I ’m from , this is going to give them the right to be more
aggressive . ” "

I 'm really loving your this .
It seems chaotic but all the marks come together to form the image really amazingly .
Very unique style
Years ago , I heard a story about a group of publishers asked to recommend books for translation .
The criteria were that they should be well - written , have literary merit , be commercially viable and have been recently published .
One book divided the judges : a novel written from the point of view of a sex - abuse victim who enjoyed her abuse .
The women thought it badly written and disgusting .
The men thought it ground - breaking and provocative : its explicit content and taboo - breaking perspective were enough to give it " literary cachet " .
When it comes to sex , the usual rules for judging good literature need not apply .
I recalled the story while reading German author Charlotte Roche 's much - hyped Wetlands , a novel that has been hailed by Granta as the modern equivalent of J D Salinger 's The Catcher In The Rye , J G Ballard 's Crash and Germaine Greer 's The Female Eunuch .
Wetlands ( translated by Tom Mohr ; Fourth Estate , £ 12.99 ) tells the story of Helen Memel , 18 , who is recovering from invasive surgery on her piles .
She regales readers with intimate details about her anal sphincter ( you will never look at a cauliflower in the same way again ) , bodily fluids , shaving and general sex life .
Every orifice is explored , every fluid tasted , leaked or smeared .
Her fingers seem rarely out of her knickers .
Dirty toilet seats are rubbed against , avocado seeds pumped out of her vagina like Thai ping - pong balls and her labia ( or " ladyfingers " as Helen tweely calls them ) stretched in a way guaranteed to make women want to cross their legs .
More The Story of Ugh than The Story of O , Helen 's dirt - dodging explains why she has few friends , though no such easy explanation is given for her obsession with sex and fetishisation of filth .
Roche feebly indicates that Helen is sex - obsessed because she is lonely , her parents divorced and her mother fixated on hygiene .
Even ground - breaking feminists cannot escape the cliché of blaming mummy .

In publishing , where there 's muck there 's brass .
Robust declarations that match literary aspirations with taboo - breaking feminism are a tried - and - tested publicity ploy .
It worked for French intellectual Cathérine Millet 's The Sexual Life of Catherine M , Italian teenager Melissa P's 100 Strokes of the Brush Before Bed , and even the home - grown Belle de Jour 's Intimate Adventures of a London Call Girl .
Marrying the book to female emancipation also takes these titles out of the erotica sections and into the respectable front at WH Smith and Waterstone's , as Millet 's British paperback publisher Patrick Janson - Smith , now at HarperCollins , explains : " The people walking into shops to buy a book like Catherine M feel a bit less concerned about being seen buying an explicit book if it has literary cachet . "
The success in their native markets is part of the blag .
It adds a gloss of sophistication , even exoticism .
" There is a literary cachet given to foreign works translated into English .
It 's just another form of literary snobbery , " says erotica author Mitzi Szereto .
Szereto , who edited The New Black Lace Book of Women 's Sexual Fantasies , adds that " Had Wetlands been written by Tracy in Romford , I doubt anyone would have taken it seriously as a work of literature . "
I detect something seedier behind the hype .
Consciously or subconsciously , it perpetuates stereotypes of Continental European women once promulgated by 1970s porn .
They may be clever , these Italian , German and French girls , but oh Miss Jones , they ain't half dirty bitches .
Many women publishers agree , though few will do so openly for fear of ridicule .
" All the normal rules of publishing go out of the window when it comes to sex , it can be a badly written book , with poor characterisation , but it will be regarded as literary because it is obscene , " says one leading editor .
" What is depressing for many female publishers is that the current atmosphere of gender politics has taken away our right to say ' I do n't like this ' , because if you do , you are immediately labelled PC or lacking intellectual depth . "
Her objections will not worry Fourth Estate , part of Rupert Murdoch 's HarperCollins book - publishing empire .
It looks to have hit pay dirt with Wetlands .
A media sensation when it became the most talked - about book at last year 's London Book Fair , Wetlands has already topped the German bestseller list , selling almost 700,000 – mainly to women .
The hype has since reached across the world and turned Roche into a global literary sensation .
But Roche is adamant that she wrote the book with a feminist agenda in mind .
" The first thing I wanted to do was write a really honest book about the female body , especially all the taboos , and everything we think is embarrassing about ourselves , " she says .
Helen is a heroine of our times , she maintains ; open , honest and flawed .
She is not a role model but a celebration of " real women " .
The danger with having a manifesto driving a character is that , instead of a girl with a one - track mind , the lead character is reduced into a one - track girl .
What may start out as a strong voice becomes monotone .
Helen knows how to talk dirty but lacks emotional leverage .
She is not helped by coy references to women 's bits , such as " pearl trunk " for clitoris .
Maybe they work better in the original German .
Helen 's motivation is just one of many black holes through which Roche 's readers are apt to fall , if they have n't given up after being plunged into what she acknowledges with glee as the first of many " disgusting bits " in chapter one .
Helen 's sexual activities , which occupy almost every page , are described with the mechanistic detail of a car manual .
As with all porn , the relentless repetition of sex act after sex act leaves little room for character development .
Helen becomes as objectified as the women paraded in the pages of Readers ' Wives .
Claims that Roche is challenging notions of female sexual expression are undermined by Helen 's age : she is yet another barely legal girl " discovering herself " .
Yes , her addiction to her secretions is different , but shown through the filter of an almost sociopathic sexual obsession .
It reads like something from Alastair Campbell 's youthful stories in Forum .
To claim that the sexual confessions of a nubile girl are a breakthrough for women is disingenuous .
This has been the currency of erotic fiction since The Story of O , never mind porno in print and film .
Evidently , this appears to be a sore point .
Roche robustly rejects accusations that she is pandering to male fantasies .
She chose a teenage cipher for her manifesto because " it is such a magical age " .
Her claims are undermined by the fact that she seems to appreciate male feedback more than female about the book .
She boasts that men tell her " all the time " that they were turned on by her book .
On the other hand , women " would n't dare to say that it turned them on " .
When I point out that maybe they are n't being coy , but just did n't find it arousing , she seems flustered .
Instead , Roche talks about female masturbation , the gist being that women either do n't do it or only do it for men .
They certainly do n't talk about it in Roche 's universe– a point that seems , in Britain at least , at odds with countless magazine articles for women , whole episodes of Sex and the City and record sales of the Rampant Rabbit .
Again , when I point this out she seems lost .
Sex and the City is a fantasy , she says .
But is n't Wetlands fantasy ?
" Yeah , but that is for me sitting there thinking of these things , being really creative and individual , " she says enigmatically .
It is this kind of logic , underpinned by a book relentless in its detail and joyless in its treatment of female sexual appetites , that undermines Roche 's intellectual claims .
As with so many literary sex objects before her , Helen 's rapacious sex drive comes from a place of pain and not passion .
In the end , Wetlands reads like any other wank mag .
It is a point that Roche does not entirely dispute .
" When I started off , I was always sitting in German TV shows saying : ' This is a book for wanking , for men and women . ' "
She says this with such dramatic relish , like someone being really naughty in front of the camera , that it makes me realise why her status in Germany is likened to that of Davina McColl .
She could be egging on the crowd outside the Big Brother house .
Her failure to convince me will not stop some believing that Wetlands is on a par with the best taboo - breaking novels .
This is a Marmite book , one that you either love or loathe .
Within publishing , women seem to hate it and men think it is ground - breaking .
That shows some things do n't change .
Lennie Goodings , editorial director of Virago , and not one to balk at strong content , hates it .
" It is n't feminism .
It 's just shocking , " she says .
" I do n't see why they have to wrap it up in feminism . "
Over at Canongate , the hugely respected editor Francis Bickmore loves it – though he admits he only read a few pages when it came up for auction .
" I think it is courageous of Fourth Estate to take on this book on , " he says .
" I think Charlotte Roche is writing Punk Feminism .
She is about shocking people .
It is porn , but it is also about throwing the cat among the pigeons . "
And the avocado seeds and the shaving brush and the haemorrhoids .

Anaïs Nin
Delta of Venus , Little Birds
Known primarily for her diaries , which she began writing when she was 11 years old , Anaïs Nin is maybe best remembered as a writer of erotic fiction from a woman 's perspective .
Writing in the 1940s for an anonymous collector , she produced two collections of stories : ' Delta of Venus ' and ' Little Birds ' .
In her journals she refers to bisexuality and an incestuous relationship with her father .
Her lovers included Henry Miller and Gore Vidal , and when she died in 1977 she was discovered to have had a ' husband ' on each coast of the USA .
Erica Jong
Fear of Flying
Jong 's 1973 novel ' Fear of Flying ' coined the term ' zipless fuck ' and inspired a generation of women who felt as stuck as its sexual adventuress narrator , Isadora , in their marriages .
She denies that the book is autobiographical but admits that elements of it are modelled on her own life .
Jong 's daughter , Molly Jong - Fast , herself a novelist , says that as a child she was horrified by her mother 's ' dirty books ' .
Last October , New York - born Jong admitted that her fear that Barack Obama would not win the US election had developed into an " obsession .
A paralyzing terror . "
Cathérine Millet
The Sexual Life Of Catherine M
Until 2001 , Cathérine Millet was just a middle - aged Parisian critic , curator and editor who ran a well - regarded journal , Art Press .
Then , looking back from a monogamous present on a promiscuous past , she published a graphic confessional account of her many – often anonymous – sexual encounters : " To fuck above and beyond any sense of disgust was ... to raise yourself above all prejudice " .
Her memoir caused as big a stir here as in France .
Last year , she followed up with a book about jealousy , ' Jour de Suffrance ' .
Melissa P
100 Strokes Of The Brush Before Bed
A 17 - year - old in the small Sicilian town of Aci Castello , in 2003 Melissa Panarello published ' One Hundred Strokes of the Brush Before Bed ' : an erotic novel , supposedly based on her own experiences , but packaged in the form of a diary .
The scandalous story of " Melissa P " quickly sold half a million copies in Italy was translated into 30 languages .
Since then , she has moved to Rome and published two further novels , neither of which made the same size of splash : ' The Smell of Your Breath ' and ' In the Name of Love ' .
The California prison system must reduce overcrowding by as many as 55,000 inmates within three years to provide a constitutional level of medical and mental health care , a federal three - judge panel tentatively ruled Monday .
Relying on expert testimony , the court ruled that the California prison system , the nation ’s largest with more than 150,000 inmates , could reduce its population by shortening sentences , diverting nonviolent felons to county programs , giving inmates good behavior credits toward early release , and reforming parole , which they said would have no adverse impact on public safety .
The panel said that without such a plan , conditions would continue to deteriorate and inmates might regularly die of suicide or lack of proper care .
“ The evidence is compelling that there is no relief other than a prisoner - release order that will remedy the unconstitutional prison conditions , ” the panel said in its tentative ruling .
The California attorney general , Jerry Brown , vowed to appeal the ruling .
“ This order , the latest intrusion by the federal judiciary into California ’s prison system , is a blunt instrument that does not recognize the imperatives of public safety , nor the challenges of incarcerating criminals , many of whom are deeply disturbed , ” Mr. Brown said in a statement .

5 The Emperor
Heavy is the head that wears the crown .
Unless you 're just a madman who pretends to run a good chunk of the world , in which case it 's probably not that hard .
Such was the scenario of Emperor Joshua Abraham Norton , a homeless fellow who , by all accounts , was both as crazy as a shithouse rat and pretty awesome at the same time .

Formerly a businessman who lost every penny he had and apparently went over the edge as a result , Norton proclaimed himself " His Imperial Majesty Emperor Norton I . "
He declared that he was the Emperor of the United States and Protector of Mexico back in 1859 .
He reigned for over 20 years , walking the streets of San Francisco in full military uniform on a daily basis .
He can afford a sword ?
We can't .
What the fuck ?
He was known for making proclamations and giving orders on how the country was to be run , such as issuing an order that Congress be dissolved by force , demanding that a League of Nations be formed and that a bridge be built connecting Oakland to San Francisco .
Is it a coincidence that two of those things have since happened ?
Well , yeah probably .

So why are we holding him up as a positive example when there are probably thousands of homeless dudes who think they 're the president ?
Because the city loved him .
He made his own currency , and stores honored it .
Mark Twain and Robert Louis Stevenson both created characters based on him .
Oh , and when Norton died suddenly in 1880 , 30,000 motherfucking people showed up on the following day to attend his funeral .

( Fortune Magazine ) --
Is it time to buy U.S. stocks ?
According to both this 85 - year chart and famed investor Warren Buffett , it just might be .
The point of the chart is that there should be a rational relationship between the total market value of U.S. stocks and the output of the U.S. economy - its GNP .
Fortune first ran a version of this chart in late 2001 ( see " Warren Buffett on the stock market " ) .
Stocks had by that time retreated sharply from the manic levels of the Internet bubble .
But they were still very high , with stock values at 133 % of GNP .
That level certainly did not suggest to Buffett that it was time to buy stocks .
But he visualized a moment when purchases might make sense , saying , " If the percentage relationship falls to the 70 % to 80 % area , buying stocks is likely to work very well for you . "
Well , that 's where stocks were in late January , when the ratio was 75 % .
Nothing about that reversion to sanity surprises Buffett , who told Fortune that the shift in the ratio reminds him of investor Ben Graham 's statement about the stock market : " In the short run it 's a voting machine , but in the long run it 's a weighing machine . "
Not just liking the chart 's message in theory , Buffett also put himself on record in an Oct.
17 New York Times op - ed piece , saying that he was personally buying U.S. stocks after a long period of owning nothing ( outside of Berkshire Hathaway ( BRKB ) stock ) but U.S. government bonds .
He said that if prices kept falling , he expected to soon have 100 % of his net worth in U.S. equities .
Prices did keep falling - the Dow Jones industrials have dropped by about 10 % since Oct. 17 - so presumably Buffett kept buying .
Alas for all curious investors , he is n't saying what he bought .

AJAX , DOM , whatever you call it makes it possible to let people edit a piece of text inline without having to use a submit button .
You say : but that ai n’t new at all !
I say :
But all of this has been made easy to use and implement : 2.0 !
Example page : inline edit ( no JS knowledge needed ) [ source ] | Inline example : Please edit me !
How you can make it work ( 5 easy steps for integration )
Download this javascript file : InstantEdit 2.0 JS
Create a update file that handles the input .
For example this PHP : update file
In your page add the javascript :
Optional : Set fixed vars ( like hidden elements in a field post ) .
These will be posted with the editable field so you can identify a user / session .
Last step : in your HTML for any editable field add a SPAN around it .
You ’re done !
How it works
A small piece of javascript reads all SPAN tags , checks if it has class = “ editText ” and a id= .
If that is true , it adds a onclick function .
That onclick function will create a textfield or input ( depending on the size of the editable text ) .
Someone has the ability to edit the field .
When the text field is blurred , it will read the contents , and starts a XMLHttpRequest and ‘ sends ’ the content + fieldname + any set vars to an update file .
That file will update your database , and reply with the newly set text and the textfield will disappear again .
Compatibility
This script works in Internet Explorer , Firefox , Chrome , Opera and Safari .
Update hack
If you want to force a textarea over a textfield ( for example to edit a piece of HTML ) use class = “ editText ” offsetHeight = “ 10 ” .
If you want to PUSH an ID to your script I use : id =“ edit_userID_$userID ” .
In your update script , strip the text , and keep the $ userID .
Et voila .
