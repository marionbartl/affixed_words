There are a few things that a spreadsheet can get wrong .
You can be hard to use .
You can be ugly .
You can be slow .
You can even crash occasionally .
These are all annoyances .
With a monopoly , annoyances are a way of life .
However , there is one place where a spreadsheet can never be wrong , and that is in the area of calculations , especially financial calculations .
A business uses spreadsheets to model and track its business .
It makes decisions based on these spreadsheets .
If the spreadsheet gives the wrong answer , then the business makes the wrong decision .
And a business that makes the wrong decisions does not stay in business for long .
So it was with much lament last year that I reported that OOXML , then under ballot in ISO / IEC JTC , had many egregious errors in its spreadsheet formula definitions .
In addition to enumerating these errors in my blog , I submitted them for consideration by INCITS V1 , the US SC34 mirror committee , and these became part of the bundle of comments with which the US accompanied its ballot .
Although the ballot was n’t due until September 2nd , the extravagant “ sit and do nothing ” provisions in INCITS lead to our technical review being cut off in July .
Because of the lack of review time , I was not able to do an in - depth review of all the spreadsheet functions , but only a cursory review .
But the existence of such errors as I did identify , in the already - approved Ecma Standard , was disquieting .
It should have lead Ecma TC45 to conduct a more through review of the spreadsheet functions .
But this did not appear to happen .
When we received the response from Ecma to the NB comments , in January , INCITS V1 was asked to go through all the responses ( over 1,000 of them ) to determine whether they were acceptable .
This review period was again insufficient .
As for the BRM in February , this was a travesty , as I and others have noted .
I have a theory concerning committees .
A committee may have different states , like water has gas , liquid or solid phases , depending on temperate and pressure .
The same committee , depending on external circumstances of time and pressure will enter well - defined states that determine its effectiveness .
If a committee works in a deliberate mode , where issues are freely discussed , objections heard , and consensus is sought , then the committee will make slow progress , but the decisions of the committee will collectively be smarter than its smartest member .
However , if a committee refuses to deliberate and instead merely votes on things without discussion , then it will be as dumb as its dumbest members .
Voting dulls the edge of expertise .
But discussion among experts socializes that expertise .
This should be obvious .
If you put a bunch of smart people in a room and do n’t let them think or talk , then do n’t expect smart things to happen as if the mere exhalation of their breath brings forth improvements to the standard .
So the the BRM ended a different committee than it started , and the mode of operation it was lead into caused it to act like a very stupid committee indeed .
I do n’t say this to be accusatory .
I ’m just making an observation about crowd behavior .
When a committee of experts ceases to be a deliberate committee , then you will achieve subpar results .
One of the ways the BRM was stupid is that it approved changes to OOXML that have totally broken SpreadsheetML ’s financial calculations , rendering the resulting calculations both mathematically incorrect as well as inconsistent with what Excel actually calculates .
More about this later .
Here be dragons .
One of the persistent problems with OOXML has been in the area of “ day count conventions ” as used in SpreadsheetML .
Why should day counting be complicated ?
Just count how many days between the two dates and you are done , right ?
Indeed , everywhere but in finance it is simple .
Some of the complications are for historical reasons , to try to make hand calculations easier in the pre-computer era .
Also , these conventions made the calendar more regular , so financial instruments were less distorted by calendar irregularities like leap years or variable length months .
If you assume a year is exactly 360 days in 12 months with 30 days each , then some things in life are simpler .
Of course , this makes other things in life more complicated , including defining spreadsheet functions .
The devil is in the details .
You must get these count conventions right .
Being wrong by just one day in a year may only be 0.3 % , but in a million dollar transaction , that is $ 3000 .
Not many people can afford to routinely ignore a $ 3000 error .
Different financial organizations have developed their own different day count conventions .
We have the Banker ’s Rule , the LIBOR rule , the NASD rule , the ISDA rule , ICMA rule , SIFMA rule , etc .
In Excel , these conventions are defined by a function parameter called the “ basis ” and this basis is used by many financial spreadsheet functions .
In fact , none of the following functions are adequately defined unless the day count basis values are adequately defined :
ACCRINT ( )
ACCRINTM ()
AMORDEGRC
AMORLINC
COUPDAYBS ( )
COUPDAYS ()
COUPDAYSNC ( )
COUPNCD ( )
COUPNUM ( )
COUPPCD ( )
DISC ( )
DURATION ( )
INTRATE
MDURATION ( )
ODDFPRICE ( )
ODDFYIELD ( )
ODDLPRICE ( )
ODDLYIELD ( )
PRICE ( )
PRICEDISC ( )
PRICEMAT ( )
RECEIVED ( )
YEARFRAC ( )
YIELD ( )
YIELDDISC ( )
YIELDMAT ( )
There are five basis conventions defined in OOXML , with values 0 - 4 :
Basis 0 = US 30/360
Basis 1 = Actual / Actual
Basis 2 = Actual / 360
Basic 3 = Actual / 365
Basic 4 = European 30/360
In this convention X/Y indicates that X is the assumption for month length , and Y is the assumption for year length .
Note that there is no external authority given as a reference for any of these conventions .
So it is not clear , whether the Actual / Actual convention is following , for example ICMA rules or ISDA rules .
In fact , it may be following neither rule .
So lacking any external authority , all we have to go on are the definitions provided in the specification itself .
OOXML is its own authority for day count conventions .
As I reported last July , the definitions provided by OOXML did not sufficiently define the behavior of the conventions that lie behind most of the financial functions in Excel .
Unfortunately , Microsoft / Ecma have failed to fix this problem in their proposed Resolutions , and in fact have made it worse .
Further , the DIS 29500 BRM , in its negligent bulk approval of Ecma ’s responses merely advanced these serious errors into the text which was then approved as an International Standard .
So essentially , my work in pointing out errors in the spreadsheet language was for naught .
Microsoft just shoved it all though anyways .
This puts me in a delicate situation .
On the one hand , the ODF TC really would like to finish its work on ODF 1.2 , and part of that is completing the OpenFormula work .
A key remaining part of OpenFormula is to ensure that our financial functions synch up with how Excel works .
What OOXML says is irrelevant , except to the extent that it accurately tells how Excel defines these functions .
However , inquiries to Ecma on these day count conventions , inqueries made months ago , have received no response .
Also , the final DIS text of OOXML has not been made available , not even to SC34 members and liaisons .
And there is not mechanism in place yet in SC34 for collecting defect reports on OOXML .
So we ’re stuck .
Or maybe not .
David Wheeler , Chair of the OpenFormula subcomittee of the OASIS ODF TC , has been trying to nail down the behavior of Excel ’s spreadsheet functions for over a year now .
One of the last remaining pieces is to nail down the day count conventions .
After waiting and waiting for this to be clarified in OOXML , David took matters into his own hands and decided to solve the problem by brute force , enumerating millions of test cases , indeed a comprehensive set of date pairs over a 6 year period , to try to determine exactly how the date bases in Excel work .
You can read David ’s conclusions on his blog .
What strikes me in David ’s report is that not only are the OOXML definitions incomplete and inconsistent , but they do not accurately reflect what Excel actually calculates .
So either Excel is wrong , or the OOXML standard is wrong when calculating almost every financial spreadsheet function .
This is quite an embarrassment for an ISO standard , and an unnecessary one , since I have been talking about how poorly defined these functions are for almost a year now .
Let ’s work through some of David Wheeler ’s test cases by hand , to get a better feel for how OOXML is broken .
Let ’s take the YEARFRAC ( ) function as the simplest example .
YEARFRAC ( ) takes two dates and a basis value as inputs , and returns the fraction of a year that is between those two dates .
So logically , the calculation is like :
YEARFRAC = ( interval between start - date and end - date ) / length of year .
That is the logical definition .
The only complication is the 5 date bases , and what exactly the year length is .
This last point is something that stuck out in my mind when I first reviewed the draft of OOXML last summer .
You might think the year length is 365 days .
But what about leap years ?
And what about date ranges that straddle normal years and leap years ?
This is the key fact that this function requires in is definition .
This is the problem I reported on my blog last July .
This was the problem INCITS V1 submitted with our ballot comments last September .
This is the problem that Ecma responded to in a severely flawed way in January .
This is the problem that the BRM refused to discuss and merely agreed with Ecma ’s flawed changes .
And this is the problem that is now in the final DIS version of OOXML .
Take a look for yourself in this brief extract from the final DIS version [ pdf ] of OOXML , provided for purposes of critical review and commentary .
( Yes , I now have a complete copy of the final DIS version of OOXML .
If you think that this is unfair — and I would agree with you on that — then maybe you should ask ITTF why I was able to get a copy of the final DIS , but no one else in SC34 was . )
Let ’s take a look at the ISO OOXML definitions and try some test calculations to reproduce some of David ’s findings .
First , let ’s take the date basis 1 first , Actual / Actual , since that is the easiest .
But we immediately run into a problem .
The standard says two different things .
In the “ description ” table it says :
Actual / actual .
The actual number of days between the two dates are counted .
If the date range includes the date 29 February , the year is 366 days ; otherwise it is 365 days .
However , later , when defining the return value , the standard says this :
If the Actual / actual basis is used , the year length used is the average length of the years that the range crosses , regardless of where start - date and end - date fall in their respective years .
There is absolutely no way in which these can both be correct .
This would have been easily fixable at the BRM , if the BRM had been allowed to do its job .
But I was n’t even allowed to open my mouth and point out this problem .
So now this fatal ambiguity sits in the text of OOXML , as authorized by the BRM experts and approved by JTC1 NB ’s .
Gotta love it .
But let ’s forge on and assume that we really have two algorithms , the first ( from the description ) which we will call basis 1 , and the second basis ( from the return value section ) which we will call 1′ ( “ one - prime ” ) .
We ’ll calculate it both ways .
Let calculate YEARFRAC ( DATE ( 2000,1,1 ) , DATE ( 2001,1,1 ) ,
1 )
With basis 1 , this is simple .
2000 was a leap year ( since it was a century divisible by 400 ) so the interval between the two dates is 366 days .
Similarly , since the date range includes a February 29th , the length of the year used in the calculation is 366 .
So the returned value returned by YEARFRAC should be 366/366 or 1.0 .
With basis 1′ , this is also simple .
The date interval is still 366 .
But the length of the year is now the average of the year lengths crossed by the date range .
So the average of 366 ( for 2000 ) and 365 ( for 2001 ) , or an average of 365.5 .
So using basis 1′ , YEARFRAC should return 366/365.5 or 1.00137 .
Let ’s try another , with basis 1 .
What is YEARFRAC ( DATE ( 2000,1,1 ) , DATE ( 2002,1,1 ) ,1 ) ?
In basis 1 , the interval is 731 days ( 366 days in 2000 plus 365 days in 2001 ) .
The year length is 366 , since the interval includes a February 29th .
So YEARFRAC should return 731/366 = 1.997 .
With basis 1′ , the interval is also 731 days , but the year length is the average of 366 ( for 2000 ) , 365 ( for 2001 ) and 365 ( for 20002 ) .
So YEARFRAC should return 2.0009
Just to make sure we have this down , let ’s try another example :
What is YEARFRAC ( DATE ( 2000,1,1 ) , DATE ( 2000,1,2 ) ,1 ) ?
A one day interval ?
Yes , please humor me .
OK .
With basis 1 , the interval is one day .
Since it does not cross February 29th , the year length is 365 days .
So it will return 1/365 or 0.0028 .
With basis 1 ′ the interval is also one day , and the year length is 366 , So it will return 1/366 or 0.0027
OK .
That was too easy .
One more example , to make sure that you have it down .
What is YEARFRAC ( DATE ( 2000,1,1 ) , DATE ( 2004,1,31 ) ,1 ) ?
Hmm …. this one will require more thought .
I might have to take off my shoes and count using my toes as well .
With basis 1 , the interval is 1491 days = 366 + 365 + 365 +365 +30 .
The year lengths are :
2000=366 ( since the range cross February 29th )
2001=365
2002=365
2003=365
2004=365 ( since the date range does not cross February 29th )
So we have 4 full years plus 30 days of a 365 day year .
YEARFRAC should return 4 + 30/365 = 4.0822 .
With basis 1 ′ we treat the 2004 as having 366 days and average the years in the interval , so average year length =
( 366+365+365+365+366) /5 = 365.4 .
So YEARFRAC should return 4 + 30/365.4 = 4.0821 .
Now that we ’re done with the examples , we can throw them into a table , and compare them to what Excel 2007 calculates for these same parameters :
start - date end - date basis ISO Value Excel ’s Value Excel Correct ?
2000-01-01 2001-01-01 1 1.0000 1.0000 Yes 2000-01-01 2001-01-01 1 ′ 1.00137 1.0000 No 2000-01-01 2002-01-01 1 1.9972 2.0009 No 2000-01-01 2002-01-01 1 ′ 2.0009 2.0009 Yes 2000-01-01 2000-01-02 1 0.0028 0.0027 No 2000-01-01 2000-01-02 1 ′ 0.0027 0.0027 Yes 2000-01-01 2004-01-31 1 4.0822 4.0805 No 2000-01-01 2004-01-31 1 ′ 4.0821 4.0805 No
Let your mind linger on these results for a bit .
Let it sink in .
Look at this table until you recognize its significance and cringe in disgust .
In some cases , Excel seems to be using the first definition of date basis 1 .
In other cases it is using the second definition of date basis 1 .
And in one case it is using neither definition .
In other words , this is a lot more screwed up than at first it appears .
This is not just a simple ambiguity .
The OOXML definition of date basis 1 is totally wrong .
That is just the Actual / Actual date basis .
The other 4 conventions are more complicated .
I encourage you to read David ’s write up in full to see how 3 of 5 basis conventions defined in OOXML differ from what Excel actually calculates .
David also shows how he believes Excel really calculates these day count conventions , based on his extensive tests .
Now if this was just a matter of one function in Excel , just YEARFRAC ( ) , then this would not be a big deal .
But this is flaw is inherited into most financial functions in OOXML .
Let ’s take an example at random , DISC ( ) , which calculates the discount rate for a security , given settlement and maturity dates , as well as par and redemption values .
You can read the definition of DISC ( ) from the final DIS text here [ pdf ] .
You do n’t need to be an Wall Street quantitative analyst to see some obvious problems here .
First , in the formula given , the 2nd term is divided by “ SM ” .
What is SM ?
There is no “ SM ” defined here .
There is a “ DSM ” defined , however .
Is that what is meant ?
Let ’s assume so .
We can try a test calculation , using the example given in the text of OOXML :
What is the value of : DISC ( DATE ( 2007,1,25 ) , DATE ( 2007,6,15),97.975,100,1 ) ?
B = 365 , since the date range does not include February 29th .
( Note that DISC has a single definition for year length in basis 1 , not the two conflicting definitions we saw in YEARFRAC )
DSM = 141 days = 6 in Jan+28 in Feb+31 in March+30 in April+31 in May +15 in June
par = 97.975 , which was our input parameter
redemption = 100 , which is another one of our input parameters
You can do the calculation given in the text , and find the return value of DISC should be 5.35037 % .
Plug the example into Excel and you will get the answer 5.24202 % .
So Excel is off by 2 % or so .
Do we really care .
It ’s just money , right ?
The problem is that the function in OOXML is defined incorrectly , from the financial perspective .
The discount rate is the discount from the redemption value , not the discount from the purchase price .
So the first term in the formula should be ( redemption - par ) / redemption , not ( redemption - par ) / par .
If you make this change , then the calculated value matches the value Excel gives .
Does anything strike you as odd in the above ?
Do you have a chill running down your spine ?
Do you have renewed sense of dread ?
You should , because I just illustrated another grave problem with the OOXML standard :
The spreadsheet examples in OOXML are a fraud .
You might have mistakenly been reassured by these numerous examples in the spreadsheet formula , that these actually had some relationship to the standard , that they were examples of how the calculations should be done , that they were evidence of some sort of quality assurance , that they may even be of assistance to an implementor to see whether they implemented the function correctly .
But they are n’t .
What would be normal practice would be to take the definitions , as given in the OOXML text , and to calculate the values according to the definition provided in the text , and then to compare the resulting values with what Excel returns .
That would provide a useful double - check of the definitions in the text .
But OOXML does n’t do that .
The examples here are mere fluff .
The discrepancy here also indicates that no one has actually reviewed these formulas for accuracy .
Errors like this are immediately evident , but only if you look .
The fact that things like this have escaped the notice of Microsoft , Ecma TC45 , their Project Editors , 80 NB reviews , the BRM experts , and the eagle eyes of ITTF , should make one have considerable concerns over the the sufficiency of the Fast Track review and approval process .
Let ’s try one more example before we wrap this up .
What is the value of : DISC ( DATE ( 2000,1,1 ) , DATE ( 2004,1,31),97.975,100,1 ) ?
B = 366 , since the date range includes February 29th
DSM = 1491 days = 366 + 365 + 365 +365 +30 .
par = 97.975 , which was our input parameter
redemption = 100 , which is another one of our input parameters
So , using the stated formula in the OOXML text , the answer would be 0.50736 % .
Using the “ correct ” formula , in the financial sense , the answer would be 0.49708 % .
What does Excel say the value is ?
Well , 0.49627 % , of course .
So with the DISC ( ) function we found :
Mr. Tompkins in Wonderland where c = 10 km/hr
There are many pictures so it may take a few minutes to download this page .
The hands of the big clock on the tower down the street were pointing almost to noon and the streets were nearly empty .
A single cyclist was coming slowly down the street and , as he approached , Mr Tompkins ' eyes opened wide with astonishment .
For the bicycle and the young man on it were unbelievable flattened in the direction of the motion
Mr Tompkins did not notice that he gained much in speed , but , as the result of his effort , he flattened still more and went down the street looking exactly like a picture cut out of cardboard .
Then , Mr Tompkins felt very proud because he could understand what was happening to the cyclist -- it was simply the contraction of moving bodies about which he had just learned .
" Evidently nature 's speed limit is lower here , " he concluded , " that is why the bobby on the corner looks so lazy , he need not watch for speeders . "
In fact a taxi moving along the street at the moment and making all the noise in the world was just crawling along could not do much better than the cyclist .
[ It has much more power than a bicycle , so the dilation is greater to observers . ]
Mr Tompkins decided to overtake the cyclist , who looked a good sort of fellow , and ask him all about it .
Making sure that the policeman was looking the other way , he borrowed somebody 's bicycle standing near the kerb and sped down the street .
He expected that he would be immediately flattened , and was very happy about it as his increasing figure had lately caused him some anxiety .
A beefy toshtada .
To his great surprise , however , nothing happened to him or to his cycle .
On the other hand , the picture around him completely changed .
The streets grew shorter , the windows of the shops began to look like narrow slits , and the policeman on the corner became the thinnest man he had ever seen
And the buildings are thinner and closer together .
" By Jove ! " exclaimed Mr Tompkins excitedly , " I see the trick now .
This is where the word relativity comes in .
Everything that moves ?
relative to me gets shorter for me , or whoever works the pedals ! "
He was a good cyclist and was doing his best to overtake the young man , but he found that it was not at all easy to get up speed .
Although he was working on the pedals as hard as he possibly could , the increase in speed was almost negligible .
His legs already began to ache , but still he could not manage to pass a lamp - post on the corner much faster than when he had just started .
It looked as if all his efforts to move faster were leading to no result .
He understood now very well why the cyclist and the cab he had just met could not do any better .
And he remembered the words of the professor about the impossibility of surpassing the limiting velocity of light .
He noticed , however , that the city blocks became ? still shorter and the cyclist riding ahead of him did ?
not now look so far away .
He overtook the cyclist at the second turning and , when they had been riding side by side for a moment , was surprised to see that he was quite a normal , sporting - looking young man .
" Oh , that must be because we do not move relative to each other , he concluded , and he addressed the young man  Excuse me , sir ,  he said , " Do n't you find it inconvenient to live in a city with such a slow speed limit ? 
 Speed limit ?  returned the other in surprise , we do n't have any speed limit here .
I can get anywhere as fast as I wish , or at least I could if I had a motorcycle instead of this nothing - to - be - done - with old bike ! 
 But you were moving very slowly when you passed me a moment ago  , said Mr Tompkins .
 I noticed you particularly . 
 Oh you did , did you ?  said the young man , evidently offended .
 I suppose you have n't noticed that since you first addressed me we have passed five blocks .
Is n't that fast enough for you !
 But the streets became so short ,  argued Mr Tompkins .
 What difference does it make anyway , whether we move faster or whether the street becomes shorter .
I have to go ten blocks to get to the post office , and if I step harder on the pedals the blocks become shorter and I get there quicker .
In fact , here we are , said the young man getting off his bike .
Mr Tompkins looked at the post office clock , which showed half - past twelve .
 Well !  ?
He remarked triumphantly , it took you half an hour to go this ten blocks .
When I saw you first it was exactly noon ! 
 And did you notice this half hour ?
 asked his companion .
Mr Tompkins had to agree that it had really seemed to him only a few minutes .
Moreover , looking at his wrist watch he saw that it was showing only five minutes past twelve .
 Oh ,  he said , is the post office clock fast ? 
 Of course it is , or your watch is too slow , just ?
because you have been going too fast .
?
What 's the matter with you , anyway ?
?
Did you fall down from the moon  and the young ? man went into the post office .
After this conversation , Mr Tompkins realized how unfortunate it was that the professor was not at hand to explain all these strange events to him .
The young man was evidently a native , and had been accustomed to this state of things even before he had learned to walk .
So Mr Tompkins was forced to explore this strange world by himself .
He put his watch right by the post office clock and , to make sure that it went all right , he waited for ten minutes .
His watch did not lose .
Continuing his journey down the street he saw the railway station and ?
decided to check his watch again .
To his surprise it was again quite a bit slow .
 Well , this must be some relativity effect , too , concluded Mr Tompkins , and decided to ask about it from somebody more intelligent than the young cyclist .
The opportunity came very soon .
A gentleman obviously in his forties got out of the train and began to move towards the exit .
He was met by a very old lady , who , to Mr Tompkins 's great surprise , addressed the young man as  Dear Grandfather 
This was too much for Mr Tompkins .
Under the excuse of helping with the luggage , he started a conversation .
 Excuse me , are you really the grandfather of this nice old lady ?
You see , I am a stranger here , and I never 
 Oh , I see , said the gentleman , smiling with his moustache .
 I travel quite a lot , and , as I spend most of my life in the train , I naturally grow old much more slowly than my relatives living in the city .
I am so glad that I came back in time to see my dear little granddaughter still alive !
But excuse me , please , I have to attend to her in the taxi  .
Having a cup of coffee , Mr Tompkins even went so far as to claim that he had found a contradiction in the famous principle of relativity .
 Yes , of course ,  thought he , if all were relative , ? the traveller would appear to his relatives as a ?very old man , and they would appear very old to ?him , although both sides might in fact be fairly ?
young .
But what I am saying now is definitely nonsense : ?
One could not have relative whiskers !
So he decided to make a last attempt to find out how things really are , and turned to a solitary man in railway uniform sitting in the buffet .
 Will you be so kind , sir ,  he began , will you be good enough to tell me who is responsible for the fact that the passengers in the train grow old so much more slowly than the people staying at one place ?

 I am responsible for it  , said the man , very simply .
 Oh ! exclaimed Mr Tompkins ,  So you have solved the problem of the Philosopher 's Stone of the ancient alchemists .
You should be quite a famous man in the medical world .
Do you occupy the chair of medicine here ? 
 No ,  answered the man , being quite taken aback by this , " I am just a brakeman on this railway . 
 Brakeman !
You mean a brake man . . . exclaimed Mr Tompkins , losing ground beneath him  You mean you just apply the brakes when the train comes to the station ? 
 Yup , that 's all I do , and every time the train gets slowed down , the passengers gain in their ages relative to other people
Of course , the engine driver who accelerates the train does his part too . 
 But what 's that have to do with staying young ?? 
 I asked a university professor about it once , but only got a bunch of incomprehensible talk including something about Redshifts , I think .
Sheesh  , and he walked off .
A big , sombre - looking waiter came to his table with a bill , and Mr Tompkins began to search in his pockets for change ..
Not finding any , he asked the gloomy waiter whether a cheque would do .
 No ,  barked the waiter , give me cash .
Cash it please ! 
And Tompky raised his head from the table .
Across the table stood the professor , pushing a cheque towards him in the bank .
 Oh ,  exclaimed Mr Tompkins ,  Am I glad to see you .
I just wanted to ask if one can get eternal life simply by running round all the time ? 
 Sorry , I do n't get you " , said the professor .
Will you please cash this cheque , I am in a hurry for a meeting and I hate meetings ! 
Mr Tompkins sighed , and started to count out the banknotes .
 Ill take a course in physics ! 
A van is usually a box - shaped four wheel vehicle used for transporting goods or groups of people .
It is about the same width and length as a large automobile , but usually taller and higher off the ground , also referred to as a light commercial vehicle .
However , in North America , the term may be used to refer any truck with a rigid cargo body fixed to the cab , even up to large sizes .
If you are starting up a new business or need to replace your old van the first place to start is on - line .
On the auction sites there is lots of information regarding current van makes and models to help with researching the right van for you .
Some auction sites are free and some charge a minimal fee to join in the bidding .
Online van auctions can be fun and exciting .
You have access to sometimes thousands of vans all in one place and you can get into an exciting bidding war with other interested individuals .
If paying a cheap car breakdown cover fee makes you want to reconsider , just think about gas prices and how much you'd be spending driving around van lots looking for that perfect van .
Once you have narrowed down the make and model , simply enter this into a classified van action like auto trader , ebay or vanlocator and you will be given a list of vans to choose from .
Before you participate in an online van auction , familiarize yourself with a smaller online auction like ebay just to see how the process works .
Online van auctions are similar to the smaller , ebay type auctions but the restrictions could be much more rigorous .
You will also have to do your homework so you will know how much to bid on a van .
Euphorbias , or " spurges , " are a very large group of cactuslike plants from the Old World .
Cacti themselves are New World species .
Euphorbias are frequently spiky , just like a cactus , and the best - known species in their group is the Christmas poinsettia .
They are great to grow in the house and can have jewel - like blossoms .

When I was 3 , my family came to the United States from the USSR .
My parents '
English as a second language teacher and her adult sons ( who were biologists ) became our closest friends , helping us transition as Americans .
When I was about 5 , the youngest — cactus expert John Trager — gave me my first cactus , Mammillaria zelmaneana , in a cute elephant pot .
I was hooked .
One evening , he had my family over to look at , and smell , a cactus called a night - blooming cereus .
It was special , solemn , magical — almost like a church ritual .
The cactus stood on an " altar " of patio furniture .
The majestic white flowers bloom for just one night and then wither .
The aroma was subtle and divine .

Cacti are unusual , nearly infinitely variable in texture , spine , color and shape , though not often appreciated , in the beauty and variety of their flowers .
Cacti do n't require much water , as they are adapted to desert living , and they are extremely easy to propagate from cuttings .
Since my first Mammillaria , I have always kept potted cacti , succulents and euphorbias ( spiky plants of the Old World known for their celebrity spikeless member , the Christmas poinsettia ) .
In 2008 , my husband and I moved to a house in Oakland , California .
It was my first chance to have an outdoor desert garden .
In 2012 , John Trager — now well established as curator of the desert collections at Huntington Botanical Gardens in Pasadena , California — gave me a simple , foolproof recipe for the dirt : 80 percent fine lava rocks to 20 percent compost , with a bit of native soil mixed in .

[ Capturing Cacti Before the Disappear : Q&A with Cacti Curator John Trager ]
Three years ago my plants went in , and they always bring me joy .
And they grow rapidly .
My Echinopsis pachanoi ( St. Peter 's Cactus ) comes from a big piece of cactus that fell off my mom's neighbor 's plant .
It was 2.5 feet tall when we planted it , and the tallest plant in the garden .
Now it is easily more than 11 feet tall and about to bloom again .
As a science illustrator , my eyes are attuned to the shapes and structures of the plants .
I photograph them for personal satisfaction and exploration , and as a way to share them with friends on Facebook , especially the buds and flowers .
If it 's a new plant I just got at a nursery it 's a journey of discovery , as I never know what color or shape new flowers will be .
Each cactus has its own schedule of blooming and a definite preference for time of day when flowers will open .
After my husband and I converted our lawn to xeriscape — ( a garden that requires very little water ) — many homes on our block have followed .
I share cuttings with neighbors and see them up and down the street .
These plants bring not only beauty and joy , but a respite from over - consuming water in a period of serious drought .

Cactus royalty
Mammillaria was the genus of the first cactus I had as a little girl of 5 .
Some plants in this genus have the distinction of flowering in a " crown " of blossoms .
This one opened every flower right around Eastertime .
Architectural touch
Mammillaria showing how delightful these plants can be even with no flowers , strictly for the wonderful sculptural shapes they make .
Only for a moment
This art nouveau shape is a flower bud of Echinopsis schickendantzii unfurling .
The aroma was amazing .
The flower was open for a total of 48 hours .
The plant itself came from a cutting I found in a garden .
Reaching for the stars
This is the tallest plant in my garden : Echinopsis pachanoi .
It grew from 2.5 feet tall to 11 feet in just three years .
The blossoms at the top last less than two days , but they attract many bees .
Large and in charge
This year our torch cactus , Echinopsis huascha , was incredibly prolific with blossoms .
We had three really big cohorts of flowers .
Each flower lasts a little more than a day , and has no smell .
I am sitting in the frame , for scale .
Splendor from the start
Watching a new cactus make a bud and fully flower is one of the most exciting parts of owning a desert garden .
The buds , with their own marvelous shapes , textures and colors are just as exciting as the opened flowers .
This is Echinopsis oxygona , the Easter lily cactus .
Diversity abounds
Cacti and succulents are delightful for their nearly infinite variety .
It will never fail to surprise you .
This is the many - petaled flower of a Sempervivum succulent ( a genus well known for the " hen- and - chickens " variety ) .
Desert jewels
Euphorbias , or " spurges , " are a very large group of cactuslike plants from the Old World .
Cacti themselves are New World species .
Euphorbias are frequently spiky , just like a cactus , and the best - known species in their group is the Christmas poinsettia .
They are great to grow in the house and can have jewel - like blossoms .
Bright night decor
Machairophyllum brevifolium is a South African succulent ground cover .
It is most notable for its bright yellow , crepuscular , dandelionlike flowers .
These open right around sundown and stay open for about 4 hours .
In their native land they are pollinated by a moth .
Each bloom lasts a few nights , then shrivels .
Another unique flower
Stapelia grandiflora is remarkable to watch .
Its bud forms like an inverted hot - air balloon about 5 inches in length .
When ready , one petal drops down , as if opening the hatch .
The other ones follow , creating a fleshy , burgundy and hairy flower .
Bottle flies immediately appear , even if you have never seen them around .
The flies think the flower is carrion because of the weak carrionlike smell it emits .
As the fly lays maggots , the flower is pollinated .
Unfortunately for the maggots , the flower is not a suitable source of food , as real rotting meat would be , and they die as the flower closes up .
A rainbow of blooms
Cacti bloom in almost every shade of the rainbow .
This Parodia magnifica is native to the south of Brazil .
It is a reliable bloomer and has a display every year .
Beautiful bloom
Gymnocalycium bruchii , from Argentina , is a tiny , squat cactus with a wonderful , almost salmon - colored bloom that lasts for a few days , opening up around 2 p.m. each day .
A surprising find
The spruce cone cholla , or Tephrocactus articulatus , is a plant native to the southern parts of Mexico .
It was a great surprise to see it bloom this far north ( near San Francisco ) .
After blooming it went dormant for more than a year , but is now sporting three new vegetative sections .
True love
I am not shy from following my passion during my travels , and visiting the desert cousins of my garden plants .
I do n't fear the spikes , and am easily provoked to hug cacti .
Although my husband always carries special tweezers for just such an occasion .

Cactus growing tips
You can plant cacti using plants you purchase at the nursery , or cuttings you find or make .
Use a well - draining soil .
I recommend 70 percent smallest grade ( one - quarter inch or smaller ) chipped lava rock ( red or black ) , and 30 percent black / rich compost that is not chunky .
Place cacti in pots .
If you have the option for an outdoor garden , they will do better there , with the same potting mix as mentioned above .
If the plants are from the nursery , remember that you may have purchased a plant that is used to a greenhouse environment ( perhaps protected and / or slightly humid ) .
Your home garden environment may be drastically different .
I have burned plants that way , even killed them — even when I knew I had purchased desert - hardy species .
Go easy on them .
Protect them with squares of window screen or similar mesh ( such as an umbrella ) for the first few weeks so they do n't sunburn .
For cuttings : leave on the windowsill for their scabs to heal , at least for a week ( and up to a year ) ; otherwise they can catch an infection from soil microbes .
Cacti like sun and a little neglect .
It 's much easier to overwater them and drown or rot their roots than to underwater them .
Sometimes I do n't water my plants for months .
Outdoor cacti must be watered only after the evening shadows are covering them , or before the morning sun comes out .
If water splashes on them in the sun , it will burn their bodies and result in brown or discolored spots .
In hotter months , outdoor plants are the most active and need the most water ( maybe a watering once a week ) .
In winter , many of the plants go dormant and can go for months without water .
Plants get plant - to - plant contamination .
If you see scale insects or aphids , or other pests , make sure that plant does n't brush up against any of your other ones ( where it stands day to day , or if you water your plants together in the kitchen sink ) .

A group of American advisers led by a small State Department team played an integral part in drawing up contracts between the Iraqi government and five major Western oil companies to develop some of the largest fields in Iraq , American officials say .
The disclosure , coming on the eve of the contracts ’ announcement , is the first confirmation of direct involvement by the Bush administration in deals to open Iraq ’s oil to commercial development and is likely to stoke criticism .
In their role as advisers to the Iraqi Oil Ministry , American government lawyers and private - sector consultants provided template contracts and detailed suggestions on drafting the contracts , advisers and a senior State Department official said .
It is unclear how much influence their work had on the ministry ’s decisions .
The advisers  who , along with the diplomatic official , spoke on condition of anonymity  say that their involvement was only to help an understaffed Iraqi ministry with technical and legal details of the contracts and that they in no way helped choose which companies got the deals .
" It was very difficult for me to digest , " she says from Islamabad .
" I have been fighting with myself but I must go on .
No matter what the punishment the criminal gets it is no compensation for me . "
Iram required 25 operations , and lost her left eye .
Her story is not uncommon , particularly in rural Pakistan , where women have few rights and no education .
Nor is the punishment meted out to her , warranting the existence of the Acid Survivors Foundation ( ASF ) .
Victims are usually young women in their teens , who are alleged to have brought shame onto their family for rejecting a marriage - often arranged - or unwanted sexual advances .
Their burns , while horrific , rarely kill , instead leaving them seriously disfigured and confined to their homes , leading to social isolation and depression .
In 2006 , after seven years of research , the ASF issued its first report into attacks by acid , which is cheap and readily available in Pakistan .
In the four years after 1999 , the ASF had to deal with an alarmingly high number of attacks .
Rates began to fall in 2003 , thanks to local international education campaigns , rallies during International Women 's Day to raise awareness , the support of human rights organisations and the United Nations and , importantly , by victims speaking out .
And yet , shockingly , more than one incident is reported every two days .
Dressed in a yellow sari which reveals her scarred body , Mumtaz Mai proudly cradles her nine - day - old daughter Fatima .
The 38 - year - old , who lives in Basti Dollay Wali , a village in Punjab in Pakistan , was attacked in the middle of the night by an unknown person .
Like many woman living in small villages , she was working in the fields to help support her family .
Her attacker has never been caught .
" I have my family but lost my beauty , " she says .
Saira Liaqat , 22 , disguises the pain of being stripped of her youth and beauty with a beautiful smile .
At 18 , Saira , of Lahore , was caught up in a family argument over an arranged marriage .
She was deemed an unsuitable wife after her soon to be sister - in - law convinced her brother that she was not the right woman for him and that the family could not afford the money to carry out the pre-marriage ceremony .
Not all the women are able to smile and find happiness .
Shamim Mai , 35 , and her 15 - year - old daughter Safia , were attacked when they were asleep .
Safia was just a baby .
In 1993 , unaware of what she was risking , she challenged a man who sexually abused her while working in the fields in Khan Walla , Pakistan .
The man waited until nightfall , while mother and baby were asleep , to douse them in acid .
Shamim underwent multiple operations to restore her sight , but has been left with partial vision .
She is now a widow and admits : " My happiness is gone . "
Then there is Haleema Abdul - Ghafar , 36 , and her daughter , Kausar , 8 , who were victims of acid violence .
Haleema , who lives in a small village in the province of Muzaffargarh , says she and her daughter were attacked eight years ago while they slept .
" I have gone through so much pain and the criminal was never caught , " she says .
Nalia Raza , 17 , paid the ultimate price for rejecting her school teacher 's sexual advances .
She was just 13 when she became another acid victim .
Nalia , from a small village in southern Punjab , must travel long distances to get medical care for her eyes .
In parts of the world many 15 - year - old girls are at school and flirting with boys their own age .
But not for Sabra Sultan , who at 15 was a child bride married off to an older man .
The 28 - year - old says her husband became discontent with the relationship and she was attacked because she was unable to afford the dowry .
" My face was burned , not my heart .
I try to stand up like a firm wall but there are people who want to break down that wall , " she says .
Many of these women and girls will never recover from the physical and psychological trauma they have been forced to endure .
Sadly , many will never see their attackers jailed .
In Pakistan , where women face bias in the criminal justice system , the police are reluctant to deal with so - called family matters .
Only a small percentage of cases go to trial , bringing the criminals to justice .
Most are settled out of court after a substantial bribe is paid .
With the help of ASF and non-profit organisations such as the Depilex Smileagain Foundation ( DSF ) , victims are able to receive ongoing medical treatment , including reconstructive surgery .
A team of Italian doctors , with the support of DSF , continues to work and support acid burns victims in Pakistan .
" Our objective is to rehabilitate these women , restoring to them a sense of dignity and achievement and mobility through surgery , " says the DSF .
All surgeries are complicated and involve skin grafting as well as the insertion of skin expanders .
The foundation , which has been recognised by the Vatican for its work in this area of women and child abuse , plans to establish a rehabilitation and a vocational training centre , which will provide residential care for 50 victims and 24 - hour medical care .
Ultimately the foundation hopes to give these women the strength and courage to try to live an independent life .
Perl の正規表現リテラル中の変数展開を読 む
Perl の正規表現リテラル中の変数展開では、文法上、 解釈にあいまいさが生じることがあります 。
この文章では 、Perl インタプリタのソースコードから、 実装上でどのようにあいまいさが解決されるのかを説明します。
更新履歴

Perl の判断
Perl では、文字列リテラルや正規表現リテラルの中で変数展開を行えます。
use Test :: More tests => 2 ; my $ name = ' Alice ' ; $ _ = " My name is $ name " ; is ( $_ , ' My name is Alice ' , ' $ name として Alice が展開される ' ) ; s/$name / Bob/g ; is ( $_ , ' My name is Bob ' , ' Alice が Bob に置き換えられる ' ) ;
しかし、正規表現リテラルのなかで配列の要素を展開する際には、 [ 〜 ]
が配列の要素の参照にも、正規表現の文字クラスにも使われるため、
解釈に曖昧さが生じてしまいす。
use Test :: More tests => 3 ; my @numbers= qw( zero one two ) ; is ( $ numbers [ 1 ] , $ numbers [ 001 ] , ' 1 == 001 ' ) ; $ _ = ' one two three ' ; s/$numbers [ 1 ] / xxx / g ; is ( $_ , ' xxx two three ' , ' one が xxx に置き換えられる ' ) ; $ _ = ' one two three ' ; s/$numbers [ 001 ] / xxx /g ; is ( $_ , ' xxx two three ' , ' one が xxx に置き換えられる ' ) ;
結果、上記のテストは失敗します。
% perl 2.pl 1..3 ok 1 - 1 == 001 ok 2 - one が xxx に置き換えられる not ok 3 - one が xxx に置き換えられる #
Failed test ' one が xxx に置き換えられる ' # at 2.pl line 15 .
# got : ' one two three ' # expected : ' xxx two three ' # Looks like you failed 1 test of 3 . %
つまり 、Perl にとって s/$numbers [ 1 ] / xxx / g ; と s/$numbers [ 001 ] / xxx /g ; は等価ではないのです。
判断の設 計
判断の根拠はどこにあるのでしょうか。
『プログラミング Perl』 の 「 2.6.5 配列値を変数展開する」ではこの問題について
Perl は [ bar ]
がどちらを表すかを推測するが、ほとんどのケースで適切な判断を下してくれる。
とあり、その注 で
推測を行なうアルゴリズムを詳細に説明してみても、退屈なので割愛する。
基本的には、文字クラスらしく見えるもの ( a - z、\w、先頭の ^ ) と、 式らしく見えるもの ( 変数や予約語 ) との加重平均をとって決定する。
としています 。
判断の実 装
それでは 「退屈なので割愛」されたアルゴリズムを実際に読んでみましょう。
実装は toke .c の S_intuit_more という関数にあります。
/* S_intuit_more * Returns TRUE if there 's more to the expression ( e.g. , a subscript ) , * FALSE otherwise .
... */ /*
This is the one truly awful dwimmer necessary to conflate C and sed . */ STATIC int S_intuit_more ( pTHX_ register char *s ) {
関数の先頭のコードは省略しました。 文字クラスらしいか、式らしいかの判別は以下の部分からはじまります。
/* On the other hand , maybe we have a character class */ s++ ; if ( *s == ' ] ' || *s == '^ ' ) return FALSE ; else { /* this is terrifying , and it works */ int weight =
2 ; /* let 's weigh the evidence */ char seen [ 256 ] ; unsigned char un_char = 255 , last_un_char ; const char * const send = strchr(s , ' ] ' ) ; char tmpbuf [ sizeof PL_tokenbuf * 4 ] ; if ( ! send ) /* has to be an expression */ return TRUE ;
if 文でみているのは ' [ ' の直後の文字です。 ' ]' や ' ^ ' がくれば、その時点で式ではないことが確実なので FALSE を返します 。
send には s のなかで最初に ' ] ' が出てくる位置を保持します。 ( 名前は s の end であっ て 「 送信 」ではありません ) ここで ' ] '
が見つからない場合は文字クラスではないので、TRUE
を返します。
変数 weight は「 式らしさ 」です 。S_intuit_more の最後をみる と
if ( weight >= 0 ) /* probably a character class */ return FALSE ; } return TRUE ; }
weight >=
0 なら FALSE を、そうじゃなければ TRUE を返していることがわかります 。
次に ' [ ' 〜 ' ] ' のなかの文字を順にみていくループがあります。 ループの中身を追う前に、前後を読んでおきましょう。
Zero( seen , 256 , char ) ; if ( *s == '$ ' ) weight -= 3 ; else if ( isDIGIT (*s ) ) { if ( s [ 1 ] != ' ] ' ) { if ( isDIGIT ( s [ 1 ] ) && s [ 2 ] == ' ] ' ) weight -= 10 ; } else weight -= 100 ; } for ( ; s < send ; s++) { last_un_char = un_char ; un_char = ( unsigned char ) *s ; switch ( *s ) { ... } seen [ un_char ] ++ ; }
ループに入る前には ' [ ' の直後の文字をみています 。
[ $ という並びなら weight -= 3
[ 数字 2 桁 ] なら weight -= 10
[ 数字1 桁 ] なら weight -= 100
これらのパターンは式にありがち ( $ ary [ $index ] , $ ary [ 1 ] , $ ary [ 23 ] な ど ) なため、どれも式側によせています。
ループの中では s , un_char が現在の文字、last_un_char が直前の文字で、 seen は文字ごとの出現回数を保持しています 。
ここからは switch 文の個々の case について読んでいきます 。
変数など
case ' @ ' : case ' & ' : case '$ ' : weight -= seen [ un_char ] * 10 ;
@ , & , $ はそれぞれ、配列変数、サブルーチン呼び出し、 そしてスカラー変数の先頭につく記号です。 これらの文字が登場した時点 で
weight -= いままでその文字が登場した回数 * 10
とします。 各文字の登場回数である seen をかけていて、 さらに seen は switch を抜けてからインクリメントしているので、 一回目のの登場では weight は変わりません。 二回目から式側によせています 。
変数につく記号の後は、変数名があるかもしれません。
if ( isALNUM_lazy_if( s+1,UTF ) ) { int len ; scan_ident (s , send , tmpbuf , sizeof tmpbuf , FALSE ) ; len = ( int ) strlen ( tmpbuf ) ; if ( len > 1 && gv_fetchpvn_flags ( tmpbuf , len , 0 , SVt_PV ) ) weight -= 100 ; else weight -= 10 ; }
記号に後続する文字列を識別子として読んで ( scan_ident ) から
変数が実際に存在する ( gv_fetchpvn_flags ) なら weight -= 100
変数が実際に存在しないなら weight -= 10
と、式側によせています。
else if ( *s == ' $ ' && s [ 1 ] && strchr ( " [ #!%*<>( ) -= " , s [ 1 ] ) ) { if ( /*{*/ strchr ( " ] ) } = " , s[ 2 ] ) ) weight -= 10 ; else weight -= 1 ; } break ;
ここはよくわかりませんでした。
$ の直後に [#!%*<>( ) -= がならび さらに ] ) } と続くようであれば weight -= 10
$ の直後に [#!%*<>( ) -= がならぶだけの場合も weight -= 1
バックスラッシ ュ
case ' \\ ' : un_char = 254 ; if ( s [ 1 ] ) { if ( strchr ( " wds ] " , s[ 1 ] ) ) weight += 100 ; else if ( seen [ ( U8 ) '\'' ] || seen [ ( U8 ) ' " ' ] ) weight += 1 ; else if ( strchr ( " rnftbxcav " , s [ 1 ] ) ) weight += 40 ; else if ( isDIGIT ( s [ 1 ] ) ) { weight += 40 ; while ( s [ 1 ] && isDIGIT ( s [ 1 ] ) ) s++ ; } } else weight += 100 ; break ;
ここでは weight への加算が続きます。大きく加算されるものと、 そうでもないものとの違いに注意してください。
' \' の後に 'w ' , ' d ' , 's ' , ' ] ' のどれかが登場するのは、正規表現のメタ文字なので weight += 100
いままで ' か " が登場していれば、式のなかの文字列である可能性もあるので weight += 1
' \' の後の 'r ' , 'n ' , 'f ' , 't ' , 'b ' , 'x ' , ' c ' , 'a ' , 'v' はエスケープシーケンスなので weight += 40
' \' の後に数字が来るのは 、8 進数による指定なので weight += 40 して数字部分をスキップ
' \' で終わりならば weight += 100
ハイフン
case '- ' : if ( s [ 1 ] == ' \\ ' ) weight += 50 ; if ( strchr ( " aA01 ! " , last_un_char ) ) weight += 30 ; if ( strchr ( " zZ79 ~ " , s[ 1 ] ) ) weight += 30 ; if ( last_un_char == 255 && ( isDIGIT ( s [ 1 ] ) || s [ 1 ] == ' $ ' ) ) weight -= 5 ; /* cope with negative subscript */ break ;
ハイフンは正規表現の文字クラスを範囲で指定する場合に使われます。
文字クラスの範囲指定に使われがちなアルファベット ( [ a - z ] , [ A - Z ] ) や数字 ( [ 0 - 9 ] ) 、ASCII の表示できる文字 ( [!-~ ] ) などが特別扱いされています。
ハイフンの後に ' \ ' が来る場合 weight += 50
ハイフンの前が ' a ' , ' A ' , ' 0 ' , ' 1 ' , '!'
のいずれかである場合、weight += 30
ハイフンの後が 'z ' , ' Z ' , ' 7 ' , ' 9 ' , ' ~ ' のいずれかである場合、weight += 30
最後の if は逆に、配列の添字として負数が指定されている場合を想定しています。
最初の [ の次に - さらに数字か $ が来た場合 weight -= 5
last_un_char == 255 は一回目のループか否かを判別しています。 関数のはじめで un_char = 255 して、 ループのはじめで last_un_char = un_char していることを思い出してください 。
そのほか
default : if ( !isALNUM(last_un_char ) && !( last_un_char == ' $ ' || last_un_char == ' @ ' || last_un_char == ' & ' ) && isALPHA ( *s ) && s [ 1 ] && isALPHA ( s [ 1 ] ) ) { char *d = tmpbuf ; while ( isALPHA ( *s ) ) *d++ = *s++ ; *d = ' \0 ' ; if ( keyword ( tmpbuf , d - tmpbuf , 0 ) ) weight -= 150 ; } if ( un_char == last_un_char + 1 ) weight += 5 ; weight -= seen [ un_char ] ; break ;
前の文字がアルファベットや数字でも $ , @ , & でもなく、 今の文字も次の文字もアルファベットなら、 アルファベットが続く限り読み、それがキーワードか否かをみています。
キーワードなら weight -= 50
反対に文字クラスらしさがあがる場合もあります。
今の文字が前の文字の次なら ( a の後に b など ) weight += 5
さらに、文字クラスの指定は集合なので [ a ] を [ aa ] とは書きません。 よって
weight -= いまの文字の出現回 数
としています。同じ文字が複数回登場することは、文字クラスらしくないからです。
まとめ
Perl の判断基準はきわめて発見的です。迷ったらブレースでくくるのをお勧めします。
『プログラミング言語 Perl』 の 「 2.6.5 配列値を変数展開する」から再び引用します。
あなたが ( パラノイアではなく ) 単に用心深い人物だったとしても、 ブレースを使うのは悪くない考えである。
以下のテストは成功します。
use Test :: More tests => 3 ; my @numbers= qw( zero one two ) ; is ( $ numbers [ 1 ] , $ numbers [ 001 ] , ' 1 == 001 ' ) ; $ _ = ' one two three ' ; s/${numbers [ 1] }/ xxx /g ; is ( $_ , ' xxx two three ' , ' one が xxx に置き換えられる ' ) ; $ _ = ' one two three ' ; s/${numbers [ 001 ] }/ xxx /g ; is ( $_ , ' xxx two three ' , ' one が xxx に置き換えられる ' ) ;
I ’m not a big fan of voicemail .
I do n’t mind leaving voicemail messages ; I just hate having to listen to them .
For some strange reason when people know their voice is being recorded , their brain short circuits .
What normally would take 30 seconds to say , now takes 2 minutes .
I do n’t mind it so much for people I know .
I have to deal with them on a daily basis , so I ca n’t hold voicemail grudges against them .
However , if someone cold calls me or it ’s just an acquaintance that calls , a crappy voicemail annoys me and leaves a bad impression .
I know .
It ’s superficial , but I ’m human .
But a prospective employer or client is also human , so there ’s a good chance that crappy , unclear , and long voicemails annoy them too .
So , for your consideration , here are 10 tips to help you leave the perfect voicemail and , consequently , a good impression .
Think through what you are going to say before you place the call .
When men hear the beep , they often freeze up and forget what they wanted to say .
If you want to be the go - to guy at work , then you have to exhibit competence on all levels .
Do n’t spoil your confident image by hemming and hawing and filling your messages with “ uhhhhs , ” and “ ummmms . ”
If it ’s a really important call , consider writing out what you want to say beforehand .
If the person picks up , great , you now have some notes to remember what you wanted to talk about .
If they do n’t answer , you can leave a clear and concise message .
State your name first .
You would think this would be so basic that it should n’t even be mentioned .
However , I ca n’t count the number of times I ’ve gotten voicemails where people go on and on and I do n’t even know who ’s talking to me until the very end .
Pretty annoying .
State your number right after your name .
Many people wait until the very end of the message to state their number .
This will irritate the receiver of your message because if he does n’t get it down , he then has to sit through the whole damn message again to hear it repeated .
Repeat your phone number twice .
People seem to forget that the receiver of their message has to write the number as you say it .
Do n’t rush through it .
Even when you say it slowly , it ’s hard to get down the first time .
So repeat it again , so they can check to be sure they got it down right .
State the purpose of your call .
In as few words as possible , state why you ’re calling .
Is it in regards to an interview appointment ?
Are you following up on a previous meeting ?
Find some common ground .
If you ’re cold calling someone , your voicemail is your 30 second chance to make a connection and leave a good impression .
One of the best ways to make a connection in that short amount of time is mentioning a mutual acquaintance .
You could also mention a shared affiliation with an organization .
Be brief .
Do n’t make your listener resent you for leaving a 5 minute long message .
People are busy .
Listening to 5 minute phone messages is not on the top of their priorities and wastes their time .
Many callers seem to think they are the only person in the world leaving a voicemail for a particular person .
Yet a dozen other people feel the same way and a man ends up holding the phone to his ear for an hour .
Leave a specific request .

Squeak 3.10 now released !
21 March , 2008
Squeak version 3.10 has just been released onto the ftp server .
This marks the completion of the development effort and gives Squeak developers an opportunity to check compatibility of packages and ports ; work is still under way to produce final and fully packaged release files and once this has been completed , the squeak.org images on the Download page will be updated to point to fully packaged versions of this new release .
Normal Squeak users are advised to wait for the packaged versions to be made available before upgrading .
The goal of the 3.10 release was to improve the process of making Squeak releases and to improve the quality of the code .
The release team concentrated on improving the coverage of unit tests , in making Squeak more modular , and in getting rid of non-core and unsupported code .
In addition , many bugs were fixed .
Highlights were :
– Removal of non-core code .
– Consistent use of Monticello to manage package dependencies .
– Use of Package Universes for managing package compatibility issues .
– Bug policy requiring all fixes to include unit tests .
– Image fully tested on Mac OS X Tiger , Windows XP and Simply MEPIS 6.5 Linux .
Thanks to the 3.10 release team including Ralph Johnson , Edgar De Cleene , and the many other Squeakers who contributed ideas , bug - fixes and support .
Their work has given us an excellent release , and one which will be a great starting point for eventual progress to 4.0 .
Discussions and planning for 3.11 is already beginning on the mailing list , including topics such as :
– the removal of major packages such as eToys and Nebraska to become loadable via Package Universes , and use of MinimalMorphic instead of the full Morphic suite .
– migration to the improved packaging and loading functionality of tools currently under development such as DeltaStreams or Monticello2 .
– all code under old licences has been identified , and its replacement will be a priority .
If you have an interest in how Squeak develops in the future , now is the time to have your say !
For more information about this release , see the 3.10 page on the swiki or the welcome notes in the image itself .

UK interest rates have been held at 5 % as the Bank of England decided to focus on inflation risks , despite signs that the economy is slowing .
The rate freeze had been expected , although many analysts now predict that rates will be cut to 4.75 % in June .
The decision came despite a flurry of downbeat data which added to worries about the state of the UK economy .
However , rising fuel and food prices means that inflation is ahead of the government 's target .
Further cuts to interest rates are needed to prevent the economy from drifting towards recession
Steve Radley , EEF ' Recession risk '
" The latest data shows the economy is slowing , albeit only gradually , and at the same time inflationary pressures continue to mount , " said Ian McCafferty , chief economic adviser to the CBI business group .
" The Bank faced a difficult decision , but it is no surprise that rates were kept on hold this month . "
Meanwhile the body representing Britain 's manufacturers , the EEF , said that the decision to hold rates was only delaying the inevitable cuts .
" The economy has been through a series of shocks since the credit crisis hit last summer and the Bank has been right so far in responding with a measured approach on rates , " said the EEF 's chief economist , Steve Radley .

Advertisement " However , despite concerns on inflation , further cuts to interest rates are needed to prevent the economy from drifting towards recession . "
The British Chambers of Commerce ( BCC ) argued that a rate cut would have underpinned business and consumer confidence and helped limit the potential damage to the economy .
" This decision was a mistake given the serious threats to economic growth , " said BCC adviser David Kern .
Roger Bootle , economic adviser to Deloitte , said that by leaving the rate on hold , the Bank 's Monetary Policy Committee ( MPC ) risked " presiding over the deepest and longest economic downturn since the recession of the early 1990s " .
Mr Bootle predicted that rates would fall to 3.5 % , or possibly lower , but that the moves would be " too late to prevent the economy from flirting with recession " .
Speculation Homeowners had been hoping for rate cut which - if it had been passed on by lenders - might have seen some people 's mortgage payments reduced .
However , the credit crisis has made funding mortgages trickier for banks , and when interest rates were cut to 5 % from 5.25 % last month , not all lenders passed on the full reduction to borrowers , despite government pleas .
Negative manufacturing and service sector data released this week had led some to speculate that the Bank might decide to cut rates this month .
Office for National Statistics data showed that manufacturing output fell by 0.5 % in March , the sharpest rate of decline in six months .
The figures followed data released earlier this week by the Chartered Institute for Purchasing and Supply which suggested that the UK services sector grew at its slowest rate in nearly five years in April .
The most recent available data showed that Consumer Prices Index inflation was 2.5 % in March , holding steady from February , but well ahead of the government 's 2 % target .
On Wednesday , the British Retail Consortium said food prices in April were up 4.7 % compared with a year ago , although falling prices of non -food items meant that shop prices overall were up by 1.2 % .

What are these ?
WATCHING 'BOTTLEFALL ' WATCHING ' BOTTLEFALL '
Doug James , a professor of computer science and computer graphics at Cornell University and a recycling advocate , found that of the 30 billion plastic water bottles sold in the United States in 2005 , only 12 percent were recycled .
That left 25 billion bottles " landfilled , littered or incinerated , '' according to James '
Web site .
James got so fed up when he could n't find recycling containers at two locations that he thought should have had facilities for recycling - a lunch area at Carnegie Mellon University and Pittsburgh 's Carnegie Science Center - he decided to do something about it .
James and his students animated a " twenty - first century waterfall ' ' of plastic bottles recycled - roughly 100 bottles per second - versus bottles discarded - 840 per second .
" You see all these numbers about billions of this and so on and it's hard to put it into pictures , '' James said .
" This is a very expensive sort of bar chart or plot of what it looks like in terms of what we actually do and what we do n't do . ''
By Krisy Gashler
Once reserved for Perrier - sipping elitists , bottled water has become a drink of the masses .
Sales have quadrupled in the last 20 years , and rose almost 8 % last year alone .
Marian Brown , an assistant to the provost at Ithaca College who works on sustainability initiatives , has watched this growth with dismay .
" More and more people , more and more entities on campus , even for special events , were starting to think , ' Gosh , let 's do bottled water , ' instead of putting out ( pitchers ) of water , " Brown said .
" It 's like , ' God no , they 're making it worse ! ' "
The problem is n't the water — it 's the use of resources .
It takes a lot of oil to make all those little bottles and ship them , sometimes halfway around the world .
But Tom Lauria , vice president of communications for the International Bottled Water Association , said bottled water is n't the environmental bad guy .
Sales on the rise
There 's no question that sales of bottled water are increasing .
According to Lauria 's bottled water association , in 1990 , 2.2 billion total gallons of bottled water were sold worldwide .
In 2007 , it was 8.8 billion .
In just the last year , wholesale dollar sales for bottled water grew 7.8 % , to $ 11.7 billion in 2007 , according to the bottled water trade group .
Increased purchasing of bottled water is good news , Lauria said , because much of the sales growth is coming from people making a health - conscious decision not to buy soda and sugary juices .
" We 're finding that most of that growth is in category switching , " Lauria said , citing consumer research .
" People are making a decision at lunch to buy bottled water as opposed to something else .
Some people want to reduce caffeine , sugar , many reasons . "
The Container Recycling Institute found that between 1997 and 2005 , sales of carbonated drinks remained relatively flat while sales of noncarbonated drinks , including bottled water , almost tripled .
Plastic water bottles produced for U.S. consumption take 1.5 million barrels of oil per year , according to a 2007 resolution passed by the U.S. Conference of Mayors .
That much energy could power 250,000 homes or fuel 100,000 cars for a year , according to the resolution .
Cornell University professor and environmentalist Doug James said the irony of bottled water is that it 's marketed as clean and healthy when its production contributes to unnecessary environmental degradation .
" Fiji water , for example , " he said .
" A one - liter bottle is taken out of the aquifer of this little island , and shipped all the way across the world , producing like half a pound of greenhouse gases so you can have this one - liter bottle of water . "
The taste question Another obvious issue in the consumption of bottled water is taste .
In some areas , tap water simply is n't drinkable , Brown said , and in those situations , bottled water is a useful resource .
Other consumers simply prefer the taste of bottled water , Lauria said .
" Consumers have lots of preferences and some people want mineral water for taste , " he said .
" Everyone has their own reasons for buying products .
And some people have a preference for bottled water . "
But , Brown argues , perceptions about the taste of tap water and realities about the taste of tap water can be very different things .
To test her hypothesis that tap water tastes as least as good as bottled water , Brown has been conducting a series of taste tests at Ithaca College in the past year .
In five blind taste tests over the last year , the tap water has won four times , she said .
The growth in advertising and consumption of bottled water has occurred " frankly , since the big soda companies bought up water , " she said .
" They would buy up the Dasanis , and they would buy up the Poland Springs , and you get into the huge marketing machines of the major soda industries , Coke and Pepsi , notably , and they take it to a whole different field . "
Water and waste
Then there 's the waste stream .
In roughly the last 10 years , the amount of polyethylene terephthalate plastic bottles being recycled increased from about 775 million pounds in 1995 to about 1,170 million in 2005 , according to the Container Recycling Institute .
But during the same time period , the amount of PET bottles going into landfills skyrocketed from 1,175 million to 3,900 million pounds .
Water bottles are a big part of that problem , Brown says , because there are so many more of them , and because in many states , water bottles do n't have a redemption value like soda and beer bottles do .
Lauria said the focus on water bottles is unfair because they make up " less than one - third of one percent " of the entire U.S. waste stream .
" There are many other plastic objects that are in our lives that no one seems to be concerned about and yet it all needs to be recycled , " he said .
" As you recycle bottled water you should also recycle many other products that are in your refrigerator when you 're done with them . "
Brown said that better recycling rates of water bottles would certainly help , but even better would be for people to stop using bottled water when tap water will do just fine .
" Even if we can do a good job of separating and recycling water bottles , it still comes down to the fact that it 's completely unnecessary , " she said .
" From a cost standpoint alone , people should be starting to think about , ' I 'm paying $ 1.19 or whatever it is for a bottle of water that I could get free out of my drinking water tap ? ' "
Hidden costs of water Strictly speaking , tap water is n't free — it costs about $ 0.00002 per ounce .
But single - serve bottled water costs between 1,000 and 4,000 times more , according to the U.S. Conference of Mayors .
Some cities , including San Francisco , Albuquerque , Minneapolis , and Seattle , have banned city purchase of single - serve bottled water because of waste impact from the bottles and because it 's viewed as an unnecessary cost to taxpayers .
On the waste reduction hierarchy , reduce and reuse should be above recycle , said Tompkins County Solid Waste manager Barb Eckstrom .
Even so , bottled water can provide a healthier choice in situations , like sports events , where people are going to buy drinks anyway , she said .
Brown reiterated that clearly " there is a place for bottled water . "
" But for so many of us here in the Finger Lakes we 're so blessed with excellent water systems , we need to at all costs preserve and maintain ( them ) , " she said .

The transponder [ on Flight 77 ] went off about 9 a.m. , the company said .
At that moment , the flight would have been under the control of the Indianapolis Air Route Traffic Control Center , one of 20 regional centers that track flights between airports .
The trouble should have been instantly noticeable , traffic controllers say .
Flight 77 , like other planes , at first showed up on radar screens as a short solid line , with a readout that identifies the plane and gives its altitude and speed .
When the transponder shuts down , the short line vanishes .
The speed number goes away , too .
" It 's just something that catches your eye , '' one controller says .
And it 's not that unusual .
Transponders fail from time to time ; commercial aircraft are required to carry a spare .
Although it is n't clear what happened in the case of Flight 77 , a controller 's first move typically would be to contact the pilot , and tell them the transponder was n't working .
It is important for people to understand that scrambling jet fighters to intercept aircraft showing the signs of experiencing “ IN - FLIGHT EMERGENCIES ” such as going off course without authorization , losing a transponder signal and / or losing radio contact is a common and routine task executed jointly between the FAA and NORAD controllers .
The entire “ national defense - first responder ” intercept system has many highly - trained civilian and military personnel who are committed and well - trained to this task .
FAA and NORAD continuously monitor our skies and fighter planes and pilots are on the ready 24/ 7 to handle these situations .
Jet fighters typically intercept any suspect plane over the United States within 10 - 15 minutes of notification of a problem .
This type of " immediate , high speed , high priority and emergency " scramble had been happening regularly approximately 75 - 150 times per year for ten years .
In the same ten years , there were ZERO " low speed , delayed reaction , and low priority " hijacking scrambles reported , which means that the only time interceptors were ever scrambled for ten years before 9/11 , they were using the high speed immediate scrambles .
Forty - five minutes .
That 's how long American Airlines Flight 77 meandered through the air headed for the White House , its flight plan abandoned , its radar beacon silent .
* * *
Who was watching in those 45 minutes ?
" That 's a question that more and more people are going to ask , '' said one controller in Miami .
" What the hell went on here ?
Was anyone doing anything about it ?
Just as a national defense thing , how are they able to fly around and no one go after them ? ''
Even with the transponder silent , the plane should have been visible on radar , both to controllers who handle cross-continent air traffic and to a Federal Aviation Administration command center outside of Washington , according to air traffic controllers .
The FAA , which handles air traffic control , would not discuss the track of Flight 77 or what happened in air - control centers while it was in flight .
Neither would American Airlines .
***
But even if the plane remained silent , controllers could still find it -- by switching their screen display to the old - fashioned radar that bounces a signal off the plane 's metal skin .
***
Military jets are routinely scrambled in the case of hijackings and " runners , '' planes that do not answer or do not heed air traffic controllers .
But FAA officials would not say when controllers detected the errant Flight 77 or whether any fighter jets were able to get into the air to confront it .
Fighter jets are based nearby , in Virginia , and could have reached the White House within minutes , aviation sources say .
" Controllers at the Boston Center knew American Airlines Flight 11 , which departed at 7:59 a.m. ET from Boston for its flight to Los Angeles , was hijacked 30 minutes before it crashed .
They tracked it to New York on their radar scopes .
' I watched the target of American 11 the whole way down , ' said Boston controller Mark Hodgkins . "
Norad Admits Planes Show Up on Radar Even with Transponders Turned Off
after
Before 9/11 , no transponder had ever become inactive , and so the military and FAA did n't have any experience on how to track planes with their transponders off .
Right ?
Well , a Miami - Herald article from September 14 , 2001 , states :
The official hijacking protocols provide that the loss of transponder signal be treated as a " no radio " emergency .
On 9/11 , that is exactly what happened , at least for some of the flights ( The protocols also state : " The NORAD control facility shall be advised if the hijacked aircraft is squawking a different transponder code " .
In other words , the moment a plane stops broadcasting the normal transponder code , NORAD is immediately notified ) .
As former air traffic controller Robin Hordon , who knows the flight corridor which the two planes which hit the Twin Towers flew " like the back of my hand " and who handled two actual hijackings says
On 9/11 , Flight 77 was in fact tracked on radar , and could have been intercepted with fighter jets .
However , the plane was allowed to go on a joy - ride all over the country with its transponder off for three - quarters of an hour .
As the above - quoted Miami - Herald article states : Dick Cheney also monitored flight 77 for many miles as it approached the Pentagon ( confirmed here ) .
Similarly , an ABC News article states :
And air traffic controllers and others tracked Flight 175 Indeed , radar data declassified in 2006 shows that the planes were tracked on radar virtually their entire flight , and that altitude was known for the planes during most of their flight ( only flight 77 was purportedly off - radar for part of its flight ) .
And , as recounted by a high - level Secret Service agent :
Even Neads , the Northeastern sector of Norad , admits that the hijacked planes would have appeared on radar as dashes eventhe transponders had been turned off :
Because they had been informed its transponder was off , [ Neads ] knew to look for a tiny dash instead of the usual dot .
A similar report states :
NEADS Staff Sergeant Larry Thornton says , “ Once we were called by the FAA , we could find split - second hits on what we thought we were looking for .
. .
We were looking for little dash marks . . . . ”
But the government claims that it could not locate the hijacked planes because the skies were crowded with other planes , and the military air traffic controllers could not find the planes among all of the plane signals .
As NEADS ' Thornton said :
" But the area was so congested and it was incredibly difficult to find .
We were looking for little dash marks in a pile of clutter and a pile of aircraft on a two - dimensional scope . ”
Each fluorescent green pulsating dot on their radar scopes represents an airplane , and there are thousands currently airborne , especially over the busy northeast US .
However , the hijacked planes flew in many areas which were not high - traffic areas
Moreover , it makes no sense that air traffic controllers could not focus their radar scopes solely on airplanes without transponder signals .
In other words , let 's say a Cuban jet flew onto the East Coast of the United States without any transponder signal .
Would Norad say " Sorry , we lost the bad guy 's nuclear - armed fighter jet amidst all the commuter flights " ?
That makes no sense .
Remember that Norad had run drills for several years of planes being used as weapons against the World Trade Center and other U.S. high - profile buildings , and " numerous types of civilian and military aircraft were used as mock hijacked aircraft " .
In other words , drills using REAL AIRCRAFT simulating terrorist attacks crashing jets into buildings , including the twin towers , were run .
See also this short excerpt of a Peter Jennings newscast on 9/11 .
Moreover , the military had previously run war games involving multiple , simultaneous hijackings , so this aspect of 9/11 was not as overwhelming as we have been led to believe ..
Air traffic control radar , or at least military radar , must -- with the push of a button -- be able to use computer programming to hide all data for planes which have been accounted for as normal , civilian airplanes .
In other words , those with working transponder signals .
Even if air traffic controllers have to switch from secondary to primary radar , there must be a function for the computer to remove from primary radar signals which include transponder data .
If that were not the case , America 's trillion - dollar defense system would be rendered useless .
Editor 's note : " Glenn Beck " is on CNN Headline News nightly at 7 and 9 ET .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
If you 're a poor sap who needs to eat or drive in the near future , then you might want to consider taking out a second mortgage ( assuming you could even get one ) pretty soon .
Glenn
Beck asks what country that cares about its future would do what the U.S. has to its food and fuel supply .
Food and gas prices have been all over the news lately , and even a big dumb rodeo clown like me can see that it 's all connected .
Our policies , which try to cater to everyone from oil company executives to environmentalists , end up benefiting no one -- and now we 're all paying the price .
I know that real economists probably will say that the causes of these skyrocketing prices are extremely complicated to understand , but the truth is that it 's actually pretty simple :
We 've done this to ourselves .
I do n't know if it 's because of our arrogance , our stupidity or maybe both , but I believe that history may one day judge America as the most suicidal superpower of all time .
After all , what country that cares about its future would do what America has done to its supply of food and fuel , two of the most critical things that any civilization needs to survive ?
For example , look at the way we treat our food supply .
We 've spent decades giving billions of dollars in government subsidies with incentives for the wrong things , we 've mandated that huge areas of farmland stay open for " conservation " and we 're using grains that could feed tens of millions of people to make a crappy biofuel that you can't even buy anywhere .
That 's not arrogance ?
Our fuel policy has been even more absurd .
We 're completely dependent on foreign countries , many of whom hate us , to keep our trucks moving , our planes flying and our homes warm .
That 's not arrogance and suicidal stupidity ?
Take a look at the top five countries we currently rely on for oil imports .
You tell me if these are the five you would choose if you were creating your own world superpower from scratch : Canada , Saudi Arabia , Mexico , Nigeria , Venezuela .
Aside from Canada , that 's not exactly a " Who 's Who " list of stable , America - loving countries .
And if you think I cut off the list at five because the next five are so friendly , think again .
Here 's the next five : Iraq , Angola , Kuwait , Colombia , Ecuador .
The point is that we do n't control our own destiny , foreigners do .
Despite bipartisan hatred for high oil prices , they 've gone up 49 percent since 2006 .
If we could 've done something , anything , to stop that , we would have .
But the sad fact is that we can't .
That 's why , instead of offering real solutions , most politicians offer something else : blame .
Democrats blame Republicans , Republicans blame Democrats , and nothing ever gets solved .
President Bush provided a good example of that last week when he was asked about high oil and gas prices .
" We 've had an energy policy that neglected hydrocarbons in the United States for a long period of time , and now we 're paying the price .
We should have been exploring for oil and gas in ANWR , for example , " he said .
" But , no ... our Congress kept preventing us from opening up new areas to explore in environmentally friendly ways .
And now we 're becoming , as a result , more and more dependent on foreign sources of oil . "
Personally , I think the president is right ; we should be drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge .
In fact , we should 've been drilling there a decade ago , but that 's not the point anymore .
Opening ANWR now would be like stopping at the bathroom on your way to the electric chair ; you 're only delaying the inevitable .
Should we still do it ?
Yes .
Frankly , we need all the time we can buy ourselves to find a long - term solution ; our nation 's very survival is at stake .
But ANWR is not the answer , it 's a Band - Aid , and I worry that our shortsighted politicians would use it as an excuse not to look for viable replacements for oil , which is what we really need .
Fortunately , there is some good news in all of this :
Oil prices this high mean that a lot of formerly dismissed alternatives will finally make good economic sense .
For example , back in 1980 , Congress passed the Energy Security Act , which led to the creation of something called the Synthetic Fuels Corp. ( SFC ) .
Lawmakers provided SFC with up to $ 88 billion in loans and incentives to get started ( the equivalent of about $ 230 billion in today 's dollars ) with the goal of creating two million barrels a day of synthetic oil within seven years .
So why are n't you putting SFC oil into your SUV right now ?
Well , it turns out that members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries did n't appreciate the competition so they started bringing down the price of oil .
From 1980 , when SFC launched , to 1986 , when it was shut down , oil went from more than $ 39 a barrel to less than $ 8 a barrel .
Suddenly , synthetic oil did n't seem so important anymore .
In announcing the SFC's closure , then - Energy Secretary John Herrington said that oil prices had simply dropped too low to make it a viable business .
But the good news is that those economics do n't work anymore .
The state of Montana , which is leading the synthetic fuel charge , says we can now make it for somewhere around $ 55 a barrel .
That 's more than a 50 percent discount from what it costs to buy the real stuff .
It 's the opportunity of a lifetime , a chance to use OPEC 's price gouging and monopoly against it .
So let me be the big , dumb rodeo clown once again and ask the obvious question :
Why are n't we doing it ?

Read the Burton report in full Armed forces recruits from the " Facebook generation " do not take data security seriously enough , a Ministry of Defence security probe has found .
Young recruits were used to the " rapid and often uninhibited exchange of information " , the report added .
But " this behaviour must be tempered by common sense and sound judgment ... and the particular concerns of MoD work " , report author Sir Edmund Burton noted .
He was asked to investigate after the theft of MoD laptops in Birmingham .
In a highly critical report , he says the MoD had lost its Cold War discipline for data security and there was " little awareness " of its importance among staff .
As a result a major security incident had been " inevitable " .
' Supervision failure ' Sir Edmund , chairman of the Information Advisory Council , launched his inquiry after a laptop with the records of 600,000 recruits was stolen from a Royal Navy recruiter 's car last January .
The car had been parked overnight in the Edgbaston district of the city .
Investigators found that it was one of four such laptops - out of a total of just 55 - to have been stolen since 2004 .
All were taken from parked cars .
Sir Edmund said the losses indicated a " failure of supervision " and that there was a " very limited understanding " of the MoD 's obligations under the Data Protection Act .
" During the Cold War , awareness of real security was ingrained in individuals and organisations , " his report said .
" Audit , inspection , and compliance regimes were rigorously underpinned by codes of discipline .
" These well - developed processes and procedures have not been translated , effectively into the information age .
" Generally , there is little awareness of the current , real , threat to information , and hence to the department 's ability to deliver and support operational capability .
" ' Strict control '
" Consequently , there can be little assurance that information is being effectively protected , " the report says .
Sir Edmund drew attention to the way that the armed forces recruits now come from the " Facebook Generation " among whom a culture of " rapid and often uninhibited exchange of information " was the norm .
" At work , this behaviour must be tempered by common sense and sound judgment , informed by data protection practice , and the particular concerns of MoD work , " the report noted .
" However , returning to the strict information control of the type applied to paper documentation of 15 or more years ago is not considered practical in the modern working and cultural environment . "
He said the MoD had sought to adopt modern ways of working , particularly in the personnel department with improved access to personal details .
But " one consequence of embracing this new data sharing culture has been a decline in overall departmental security practice " .
It said senior officials " shared a concern that the younger generation of MoD staff are not inculcated with the same culture of protecting information as their counterparts from previous generations " .
The report made 51 recommendations , including the establishment of a " coherent system of censure and punishment " for individuals who lose or compromise personal data which reflects the seriousness and scale of the loss .

A man posing as Darth Vader attacked a Star Wars fan who had founded a Jedi Church , a court has heard .
Arwel Wynne Hughes , 27 , from Holyhead , Anglesey , admitted assaulting Barney Jones and cousin Michael with a metal crutch .
They suffered minor injuries .
Hughes , who was drunk and dressed in a black bin bag , shouted " Darth Vader ! "
Earlier , when Hughes failed to arrive on time , District Judge Andrew Shaw issued an arrest warrant , adding : " I hope the force will soon be with him . "
In the event , Hughes turned up and the case at Holyhead Magistrates ' Court resumed .
The court heard that he had jumped over a garden wall wearing the bin bag before the attack .
Prosecutor Nia Lloyd said Barney Jones had recently started the Jedi Church in Holyhead , in honour of the good knights from Star Wars .
It had about 30 members locally and " thousands worldwide , " she said .
The cousins had been filming themselves playing with light sabres in the garden before the attack .
Hughes admitted two charges of common assault .
The court was told he had a " chronic alcohol problem " and had drunk the best part of a 10 - litre box of wine .
Mrs Lloyd said : " He was wearing a black bin bag and a cape and had a metal crutch in his hand . "
Hughes hit Barney Jones over the head with the crutch , leaving him with a headache , before laughing and hitting Michael Jones in the thigh , causing bruising .
The court heard that Hughes could not remember the incident
Both men were left upset by the incident and they believed it was pre-planned .
She added that the pair believed " very strongly in the church and their religion " .
Hughes could not remember the incident and only realised what had happened when he read about it in local newspapers , the court was told .

The court heard that Hughes had previous convictions , including affray , assault and disorderly behaviour .
The judge warned Hughes that jail remained a possibility , before adjourning for pre-sentence reports until 13 May .

( CNN ) -- Sen. Barack Obama has asked top contributors to help former rival Sen. Hillary Clinton retire the debt from her failed presidential campaign , an Obama campaign source said .
Obama and Clinton ran a protracted race for the Democratic presidential nomination that left Clinton with a campaign debt of more than $ 22 million when she bowed out this month .
About $ 12 million of that amount is money the senator from New York loaned to the campaign herself .
Obama asked members of his National Finance Committee to contribute to Clinton 's campaign if they were so inclined , but he did not direct them to do so , the Obama campaign source said Tuesday .
Watch how Obama is helping Clinton »
Individual donors can contribute $ 2,300 to individual candidates .
It would take 4,500 contributors donating the maximum $ 2,300 to pay off Clinton 's $ 10.3 million in debt owed to vendors .
Some of Clinton 's biggest debts include $ 4.6 million - plus she owes to consulting firm Penn , Schoen & Berland Associates , $ 921,408 to MSHC Partners for printing and mail , and about $ 500,000 to Electrum Productions for equipment costs .
Speaking about the Clintons , Obama said Tuesday night that " I am going to need them . "
Also Tuesday , former President Clinton 's office issued a statement saying he is " committed to doing whatever he can " for Obama .
Obama said he and the Clintons will be " working closely together over the next couple of weeks to put together a plan . "
" They 're going to want to campaign actively on behalf of the Democratic ticket , " Obama said .
" Bill Clinton is one of the most intelligent , charismatic political leaders that we have seen in a generation , and he has got a lot of wisdom to impart . "
The former president was sharply critical of Obama on the campaign trail earlier this year , and he has yet to endorse the senator from Illinois publicly , even though his wife threw her support to him when she suspended her campaign on June 7 .
" [ Sen. Clinton 's ] going to be a force to be reckoned with , not only in the Senate , but hopefully if I 'm successful in the White House , she 's going to be one of my key partners in making sure that we 're moving forward on issues like health care that she cares so deeply about , " Obama said .
Obama spoke with his former rival Tuesday and said he looked forward to speaking with her husband soon .
Obama is teaming up with the former first lady for a campaign appearance Friday in Unity , New Hampshire , where they both got 107 votes in the January primary .

All About U.S. Presidential Election
Backed by family members and supporters all across the nation , U.S. military veterans will serve citizen arrest warrants for George Bush and Dick Cheney tomorrow in Washington , D.C .
The warrants are " for multiple violations of the Constitution and international war crimes , " according to a statement issued by Veterans for Peace , a national organization of men and women who served in wars and military conflicts beginning with the Spanish Civil War in 1936 through the present war in Iraq .
" It has long been apparent that our Constitution is under attack and has been deliberately and relentlessly undermined by domestic enemies -- indeed , by our highest government officials -- who took the same oath we did and have violated it by waging a war of aggression and committing war crimes in Iraq , " according to Veterans for Peace president , Elliott Adams in explaining the warrants .
The warrants will be delivered to the National Archives which houses the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution .
The patriots will also retake their military oath , which includes the words : " I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies , foreign and domestic . "
The military veterans will hold a rally at the National Mall and lead a march for peace that includes stops at other sites including the Museum of Native Americans , where they will be joined by musician Buffy St. Marie in a ceremony honoring Native Americans , the Peace Monument on the Capitol grounds , and they will protest inadequate health care funding for returning soldiers and veterans at McPherson Square which faces the Veterans ' Administration headquarters .
Veterans for Peace members follow a “ responsibility to serve the cause of world peace .
To this end we will work with others to increase public awareness of the costs of war ...( and ) to abolish war as an instrument of national policy , " according to the organization ’s statement of purpose .
" This war has cost too many lives and resources that should have been spent on health , education and other needs , ” said Army Col. ( ret ) Ann Wright , a member of Veterans for Peace .
“ The war must be stopped before more Iraqis and Americans are killed , and the sooner the better .
Our military presence in Iraq must end so Iraqis can begin to rebuild their lives . "

I spend far too much of my life daydreaming about scenarios like this :
I wanted to ask for survival tips in case I am unexpectedly transported to a random location in Europe ( say for instance current France / Benelux / Germany ) in the year 1000 AD ( plus or minus 200 years ) .
I assume that such transportation would leave me with what I am wearing , what I know , and nothing else .
Any advice would help .
To which Tyler Cowen replies :
Find someone who will take care of you for a few days or weeks and then look for employment in the local church .
Your marginal product is quite low , even once you have learned the local language .
You might think that knowing economics , or perhaps quantum mechanics , will do you some good but in reality people wo n’t even think your jokes are funny .
Even if you can prove Euler ’s Theorem from memory no one will understand your notation .
I hope you have a strong back and an up to date smallpox vaccination .
The comments are full of informative and entertaining options .
I side with the commenters who feel that the most likely outcome is death within a few days .
Unless you ’re skilled at wilderness survival , finding edible food , shelter , and potable water in a time when those things were much more scarce than now will prove difficult .
If you do manage to survive , maybe you could set up shop selling goods that people could use :
I ’d start a shop that did nothing but boil water and then sell it .
I ’d market it as “ de - spirited ” water and sell it to midwives , priests , doctors - anyone who would be charged with the health of another .
The boiled , micro-organism free water would dramatically improve the health outcomes for anyone with cholera or plague or infection .
Even marginally better outcomes using clean water would bolster my reputation and business .
Of course , barriers to entry would be pretty low in my business , but if I were widely copied , I ’d start a health revolution .
For that quantum timeline anyway .
Again , assuming you survive , other commenters suggest that you “ invent ” something , sell it , and become rich so that your wealth will insulate you from further problems , stuff like gunpowder , mass production , long bows , guns , soap , steel , the printing press , double - entry accounting , whiskey , capitalism , and hot air balloons .
I ’m skeptical of this approach …how many people living in the US know how to make gunpowder from scratch ?
Given enough time , I guess I could build a hot air balloon that actually flies and carries human passengers but anything involving chemistry would prove tougher .
How would you survive if suddenly transported back to 1000 AD ?
Leave your suggestions for survival in the comments .

Yankees co-chairman Hank Steinbrenner , like his father George , has never been one to mince words .
When it comes to where pitcher Joba Chamberlain should be -- the bullpen or the starting rotation -- the younger Steinbrenner 's expectations are crystal clear .
" I want him as a starter and so does everyone else , including him , and that is what we are working toward and we need him there now , " Steinbrenner told The New York Times .
" There is no question about it , you do n't have a guy with a 100 - mile - per - hour fastball and keep him as a set - up guy .
You just do n't do that .
You have to be an idiot to do that . "
Yankees general manager Brian Cashman apparently disagrees .
" Joba 's staying in the bullpen right now , " Cashman told Newsday on Monday .
" That 's where we 're at .
[ Putting him in the rotation is ] not something that 's going to happen here early on , and [ Hank ] knows that .
We 've talked about it .
I do n't know what set him off . "
On Monday evening , Steinbrenner toned down his comments .
" We 're not going to rush him , " the New York Yankees co-chairman said at the team 's spring training complex .
" I think most people agree with me , including the baseball people and most of the fans , that sooner or later it would be nice if he was a starter . "
Cashman then said that the two had come to a meeting of the minds .
" Hank and I talked .
We did n't need to , " Cashman said .
" We were on the same page yesterday .
We 're on the same page today .
And we 're on the same page moving forward .
Joba Chamberlain is bullpen because it's where he 's needed the most right now as well as because he has an innings limit .
He can't start because of that innings limit or he'd have to stop starting here at some point . "
Cashman expects the switch to the rotation to come sometime this year .
" He 'll finish out as a starter .
He wo n't start as a starter , " the GM said .
Earlier in the day , Cashman said it 's too early to make any drastic changes .
In a speech to the Israeli parliament Thursday , President Bush took a swipe at Barack Obama for his willingness to negotiate with evil regimes .
“ Some seem to believe that we should negotiate with the terrorists and radicals , as if some ingenious argument will persuade them they have been wrong all along , ” Bush said .
“ We have heard this foolish delusion before .
As Nazi tanks crossed into Poland in 1939 , an American senator declared : ‘ Lord , if I could only have talked to Hitler , all this might have been avoided . ’
We have an obligation to call this what it is -- the false comfort of appeasement , which has been repeatedly discredited by history . ”
But if there is anything that has been discredited by history , it is the argument that every enemy is Hitler , that negotiations constitute appeasement , and that talking will automatically lead to a slaughter of Holocaust - like proportions .
It is an argument that conservatives made throughout the Cold War , and , if the charge seemed overblown at the time , it seems positively ludicrous with the clarity of hindsight .
The modern conservative movement was founded in no small part on the idea that presidents Truman and Eisenhower were “ appeasing ” the Soviets .
The logic went something like this :
Because communism was evil , the United States should seek to destroy it , not coexist with it ; the bipartisan policy of containment , which sought to prevent the further spread of communism , was a moral and strategic folly because it implied long - term coexistence with Moscow .
Conservative foreign policy guru James Burnham wrote entire books claiming that containment -- which , after the Cold War , would be credited with defeating the Soviet Union -- constituted “ appeasement . ”
Advertisement
Instead , conservatives agitated for the rollback of communism , and they opposed all negotiations with the Soviets .
When Eisenhower welcomed Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev to the United States in 1959 , William F. Buckley Jr. , the right ’s leader , complained that the act of “ diplomatic sentimentality ” signaled the “ death rattle of the West . ”
Conservatives even applied this critique to one of the most dangerous moments in human history : the Cuban missile crisis , during which the United States and the Soviet Union nearly came to nuclear blows over Moscow ’s deployment of missiles 90 miles off the American coast .
When President Kennedy successfully negotiated a peaceful conclusion to the crisis , conservative icon Barry Goldwater protested that he had appeased the Soviets by promising not to invade Cuba if they backed down .
The Soviets withdrew their missiles in what was widely seen as a humiliation to Khrushchev , but Goldwater believed that Kennedy ’s diplomacy gave “ the communists one of their greatest victories in their race for world power that they have enjoyed to date . ”
To Goldwater , it was far preferable to risk nuclear war with the Soviets than to give up our right to roll back Fidel Castro .
Indeed , conservatives considered virtually any attempt to bring the arms race under control as a surrender to communism .
When the SALT I agreement capping nuclear arsenals came to Capitol Hill , conservative Rep. John Ashbrook ( whose presidential candidacy Buckley supported in 1972 ) said that “ the total history of man indicates we can place very little reliance on treaties or written documents .
This is especially true when the agreements are with nations or powers which have aggressive plans .
Hitler had plans .
Chamberlain ’s Munich served only to deaden the free world to reality .
The communists have plans .
SALT will merely cause us to lower our guard , possibly fatally . ”

A few years later , Sen. Henry “ Scoop ” Jackson , the elected face of the burgeoning neoconservative movement , charged President Carter with “ appeasement in its purest form ” for negotiating SALT II , which set equal limits on the number of U.S. and Soviet nuclear missiles and bombers .
Ronald Reagan , whose election in 1980 was seen as the culmination of the conservative movement , dubbed SALT II “ appeasement ” as well , but the trope would come back to bite him .
Although Reagan pleased the right enormously during his first three years in office with his military expansion , his call for rollback and his advocacy of missile defenses , conservatives reacted with horror once he began serious negotiations with the Soviets .
When he and Mikhail Gorbachev signed the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 1987 , which for the first time eliminated an entire class of nuclear weapons , Buckley ’s National Review dubbed it “ suicide . ”
The Conservative Caucus took out a full - page newspaper ad saying “ Appeasement is as unwise in 1988 as in 1938 . ”
It paired photos of Reagan and Gorbachev with photos of Neville Chamberlain and Hitler .
Containment , negotiation , nuclear stability -- each of these things helped protect the United States and end the Cold War .
And yet , at the time , conservatives thought each was synonymous with appeasement .
The Bush administration has been little different , refusing for years to talk to North Korea or Iran about their nuclear programs because it wanted to defeat evil , not talk to it .
The result was that Pyongyang tested a nuclear weapon and Iran ’s uranium program continued unfettered .
( By contrast , when the administration negotiated with Libya -- an act that its chief arms controller , John Bolton , had previously derided as , yes , “ appeasement ” -- it succeeded in eliminating Tripoli ’s nuclear program . )
Advertisement
Alas , John McCain accused President Clinton of “ appeasement ” for engaging North Korea , instead calling for “ rogue state rollback , ” and now he dismisses the idea of negotiations with Iran .
Given conservatism ’s historical record , Obama ’s inclination to negotiate seems only sensible .
When will conservatives learn that it is 2008 , not 1938 ?
High - speed broadband could boost moves to use telemedicine Moving to the next generation of broadband technology could deliver huge economic rewards , says a report .
The Broadband Stakeholder Group report said the benefit could be in excess of £ 16bn - the estimated cost of upgrading the UK 's net infrastructure .
But those benefits should not tempt a rush to invest too quickly and boost speeds , it said .
It warned that some of the benefits will only materialise when high - speed networks have reached most UK homes .
High costs
The report looks at the likely impact of upgrading the UK 's broadband infrastructure so it can handle speeds up to 100 megabits per second ( Mbps ) .
Although some parts of the existing infrastructure can already deliver domestic net speeds of up to 24 Mbps it is widely accepted that a huge programme of work will be needed to get the whole country upgraded .
The report puts a price tag of £ 16bn on work to upgrade the networks to reach 80 % of UK homes but said : " the long - term benefits to the UK associated with the wide - scale deployment could outweigh the cost of deployment " .
Putting an exact figure on the benefits was difficult , said the report , but there were likely to be widespread economic and social advantages to having faster networks .
it matters more to do this right than to do it now
Antony Walker , Broadband Stakeholder Group
High speed broadband would give a boost to productivity as people did what they do now more quickly , by getting more out of existing applications , and by discovering many things that can not be done at slower speeds .
Economic benefits would accrue as faster networks would allow more people to work from home and allow businesses to be more distributed .
A nation wired for high - speed broadband would also benefit socially .
Lifelong learning programmes would be easier to support , flexible working would be more viable and social exclusion could be diminished .
Despite these benefits the report did not condone a rush to start the upgrading programme .
" It is tempting to jump in feet - first , but it matters more to do this right than to do it now , " said Antony Walker , head of the Broadband Stakeholder Group .
Far better , he said , would be to wait and prepare the UK so companies and investors were in a better position to start the upgrade .
Currently , said Mr Walker , there was no compelling case for investing billions to lay down next generation networks .
For the near future , he said , improvements to existing technologies could soak up the demands of consumers for faster broadband but this should not be thought of as a permanent fix .
He cautioned that the UK could not wait too long to get on with the work .
If the upgrade programme did not start within three to five years there was a danger that the UK could lose out , he said .
During that time , he said , governments , telcos and net service could not simply " park " the issue .
Instead decisions had to be taken about changes to the UK 's regulatory regime and how to deploy the technology to make reasons for investing more compelling .
The report was prepared for a joint conference organised by the Broadband Stakeholder Group and Ofcom 's Consumer Panel that will debate ways to get the UK started on its next generation broadband programme .
" It is imperative that we face the challenges of delivering a social dividend by looking at ways of delivering next generation access to all corners of the UK , alongside making the economic case for commercial roll out , " said Anna Bradley , chair of the Ofcom Consumer Panel .
Setting a target of reaching 80 % of the UK population with next generation broadband risked making digital divisions far greater , said Ms Bradley .
" We have a choice , " said Ms Bradley .
" Let 's make the right one for all consumers and citizens . "

Gallons per mile would help car shoppers make better decisions
Posting a vehicle 's fuel efficiency in " gallons per mile " rather than " miles per gallon " would help consumers make better decisions about car purchases and environmental impact , researchers from Duke University 's Fuqua School of Business report in the June 20 issue of Science magazine .
Inspired by debates they had while carpooling in a hybrid car , management professors Richard Larrick and Jack Soll ran a series of experiments showing that the current standard , miles per gallon or mpg , leads consumers to believe that fuel consumption is reduced at an even rate as efficiency improves .
People presented with a series of car choices in which fuel efficiency was defined in miles per gallon were not able to easily identify the choice that would result in the greatest gains in fuel efficiency .
For example , most people ranked an improvement from 34 to 50 mpg as saving more gas over 10,000 miles than an improvement from 18 to 28 mpg , even though the latter saves twice as much gas .
( Going from 34 to 50 mpg saves 94 gallons ; but from 18 to 28 mpg saves 198 gallons ) .
These mistaken impressions were corrected , however , when participants were presented with fuel efficiency expressed in gallons used per 100 miles rather than mpg .
Viewed this way , 18 mpg becomes 5.5 gallons per 100 miles , and 28 mpg is 3.6 gallons per 100 miles -- an $ 8 difference today .
" The reality that few people appreciate is that improving fuel efficiency from 10 to 20 mpg is actually a more significant savings than improving from 25 to 50 mpg for the same distance of driving , " Larrick said .
( See table below . )
Soll noted that replacing a large vehicle that gets 10 mpg with one that gets 20 mpg reduces gas use per 100 miles from 10 gallons to five , a 5 - gallon savings .
Replacing a small vehicle that gets 25 mpg with one that gets 50 mpg reduces gas use per 100 miles from 4 gallons to 2 , a saving of only 2 gallons .
" Miles per gallon is misleading and can play tricks on our intuitions , " Soll said .
" For families and other owners of more than one type of vehicle , the greatest fuel savings often comes from improving the efficiency of the less efficient car , " Soll added .
" When fuel efficiency is expressed as gallons per 100 miles , it becomes clear which combination of cars will save a family the most gas .
" We believe that everyone should try to be as fuel efficient as possible .
For some people , that may mean driving the most efficient car available , such as a small hybrid car , but for others it may mean finding the most efficient option possible within their chosen class of car , " Soll said .
" There are significant savings to be had by improving efficiency by even two or three miles per gallon on inefficient cars , but because we communicate in miles per gallon , that savings is not immediately evident to consumers . "
The authors recommend that consumer publications and car manufacturers list efficiency in terms of gallons per 10,000 miles driven , which is already the standard in many other countries .
" This measure makes it easy to see how much gas one might use in a given year of driving and how much gas , and money , can be saved by opting for a car with greater efficiency , " Larrick said .
USA TODAY / GALLUP POLL USA TODAY / GALLUP POLL GAS PRICES HIT USA HARD GAS PRICES HIT USA HARD Sticker shock : Gas prices rattle Americans Commuting : Interest in mass transit , carpools , scooters jumps |
Some rethink where to call home Athletics : Sports world begins to sputter Lifestyles : Cheaper strategies devised | Boaters ' plans sunk Governments : Services trimmed , fuel efficient vehicles added CALCULATE YOUR GAS COSTS CALCULATE YOUR GAS COSTS Gas prices rattle Americans Record high gas prices are prompting Americans to drive less for the first time in nearly three decades , squeezing family budgets and causing major shifts in driving habits , federal data and a USA TODAY / Gallup Poll show .
As prices near — or in some places top — $ 4 a gallon , most Americans say they are cutting back on other household spending , seriously considering buying more fuel - efficient cars and consolidating their daily errands to save fuel .
Americans worry that steep gas costs are here to stay : eight in 10 say they doubt today 's high prices are temporary , the poll finds .
It 's the first time such a large majority sees pricey gas as a long - term problem .
The $ 4 mark , compounded by a sagging economy , could be a tipping point that spurs people to make permanent lifestyle changes to reduce dependence on foreign oil and help the environment , says Steve Reich , a program director at the Center for Urban Transportation Research at the University of South Florida .
" This is a more significant shift in behavior than I 've seen through other fluctuations in gasoline prices , " he says .
" People are starting to understand that this resource … is not something to be taken for granted or wasted . "
The average price of a gallon of gas nationwide is $ 3.65 — the highest ever , adjusted for inflation .
California 's average : $ 3.90 a gallon .
The federal Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) expects a $ 3.66 per-gallon average this summer .
The pinch is reshaping the way Americans use their cars : • February was the fourth consecutive month in which miles driven in the USA fell , an analysis of Federal Highway Administration data show .
There has n't been a similar decline since 1979 , when shortages created long lines at pumps .
In the 12 months ending in February , the latest month for which data are available , miles driven fell 0.4 % from a year earlier .
The last drop of that scale was in 1980 - 81 .
The decline , while small , is significant because the U.S. population and number of households , drivers and vehicles grow by 1 % to 2 % a year .
A gallon of gas has gone up 59 cents since February , suggesting the trend seems likely to continue .
The EIA expects demand for gas to shrink 0.4 % this summer from 2007 and fall 0.3 % for the year .
It would be the first dip in annual consumption since 1991 . •
In 2004 and 2005 , about one - third of Americans said they cut spending because of rising gas prices .
In the new poll , 60 % say they are trimming other expenses .
Half of households with incomes below $ 20,000 say they face severe hardships because of soaring gas prices .
Three - fourths of households making $ 75,000 or more also are changing how they use their cars .
Dawn Morris , a consultant in Dover , Del. , is blunt about how gas prices are affecting her family .
" It 's killing us , " she says .
She and her husband often stay home on weekends , and when she balances her checkbook , " every third line it says gas : $ 20 , $ 30 , $ 50 . " • Americans ' efforts to conserve gas are evident across the USA .
At Don Jacobs Used Cars in Lexington , Ky. , salesman Tony Morphis says customers are dumping gas guzzlers and ask first about gas mileage when they shop for replacements .
Sonya Jensen , owner of Cat's Paw Marina in St. Augustine , Fla. , says some boat owners are considering selling their watercraft .
At Cycle Cave in Albuquerque , Hervey Hawk says customers are " dragging 30 - to 40 - year - old bikes out of the garage " and having them fixed so they can pedal to work .
•
In the poll , eight in 10 Americans say they use the most fuel - efficient car they own whenever possible .
Three - fourths hunt for the cheapest gas available .
Six in 10 share rides with friends or neighbors .
Three - fourths say they are getting tuneups , turning off the air - conditioning or driving slower to improve mileage .
Slower speeds might help save lives , says Dennis Hughes , safety chief for the Wisconsin Transportation Department .
There have been fewer driving deaths each month since October compared with a year earlier .
A harsh winter and record gas prices " conspired to keep a lot of people off the road , or at least to slow down , " he says .
Most of those polled expect things to get worse : 54 % say they expect gas prices to reach $ 6 a gallon in the next five years .
For now , they are rethinking the ways they get around , where they buy a home and what they do for fun .

BRDO PRI KRANJU , Slovenia ( AP )  U.S. President George W. Bush is making his last major visit to a continent where many dismiss him as yesterday 's man .
As his presidency winds down , Bush — reviled by many Europeans and simply ignored by others — can do little this week but smooth the way for his successor .
His tour kicks off Tuesday with a one - day summit of U.S. and European leaders in Slovenia , where officials have alluded to long - standing misgivings in Europe over Bush 's foreign policy in Iraq and its approach to climate change and other issues .
EUROPEAN TOUR : Bush heads to final summit with European nations " As in all relationships , the EU and U.S. sometimes have different views , " Slovenian Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel told reporters before Bush 's scheduled arrival Monday evening .
Bush and U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice planned to meet with Slovenian President Danilo Turk and Prime Minister Janez Jansa , and later with European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana at a castle that the late Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito once used as a retreat .
Later Tuesday , Bush was to head to Germany to meet with Chancellor Angela Merkel .
He also planned stops in Italy , the Vatican , France , England and Northern Ireland .
Like many Americans , Europeans have Bush fatigue .
His decision to invade Iraq stirred anti-American sentiment in many countries , although that has receded as Europeans watch the U.S. presidential campaign and weigh prospects for change under a new president .
" A lot of people like America .
They may not sometimes necessarily like the president but they like America , " Bush said in an interview with POP TV of Slovenia .
" They like what America stands for . "
Yet many Slovenes , whose country now holds the rotating EU presidency , expressed a growing disinterest in Bush , coupled with a keen interest in who will replace him at the White House .
" I believe that it 's more important now for all of us to see if his successor would do any change , " said Sonja Virant , a 42 - year - old clothes designer in the capital , Ljubljana .
Bush , she said , " ca n't do anything bad anymore — or I hope so . "
" My opinion of him ?
Negative , " said Tina Sremec , 19 , a student .
Rupel said the EU and U.S. officials would discuss a wide range of issues including the Middle East peace process , global warming and security , efforts to forge a new global trade agreement , Iran 's nuclear program , the burgeoning food price crisis and tensions with Serbia over Kosovo 's independence .
The two sides also were to discuss ways to improve airline safety and broaden a program that lets people travel in the U.S. without visas for up to 90 days .
The visa waivers currently are available for only 15 of the EU 's 27 member nations .
National Security Adviser Stephen
Hadley made clear the trip was not expected to produce any breakthroughs , saying last week : " I do n't think you 're going to see dramatic announcements on this trip . "
Underscoring the low expectations , officials said the one issue they hoped could be resolved was a long - running dispute over an EU ban on imports of U.S. poultry .
Although Bush will meet with key European leaders again at next month 's summit in Japan of the Group of Eight major industrialized nations , this week 's trip was likely to be his last major tour across the continent before the U.S. presidential elections in November .
Climate change has been a major point of disagreement between the U.S. and Europe .
The EU has committed to cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 20 % by 2020 , and by 30 % if other developed countries accept similar commitments .
But Washington has opposed binding commitments , arguing that they could hurt the struggling U.S. economy .
When Bush first visited this ex-Yugoslav republic in 2001 for a summit with then - Russian President Vladimir Putin , he was met with large and boisterous demonstrations .
This time , reflecting deep - seated apathy for a president increasingly viewed as yesterday 's man , only a few small , loosely organized protests were planned .
And though security was tight , unlike his 2001 stop , there were no American flags to welcome Bush .
" I feel nothing for him , " said Andrej Sit , a 29 - year - old CD vendor .
" I do n't think about him at all . "

A planimeter is a table - top instrument for measuring areas , usually the areas of irregular regions on a map or photograph .
They were once common , but have now largely been replaced by digital tools .
The following picture gives some idea of the setup .
The pole arm rotates freely around the pole , which is fixed on the table .
The tracer arm rotates around the pivot , which is where it joins the polar arm .
You trace a curve in the clockwise direction with the tracer , and as you do so the measuring wheel rolls along , and the total distance it rolls is accumulated on the dial .
The support wheel keeps the thing from flopping over .
At the end , you read off a number from the dial , and after multiplication by a factor depending only on the particular configuration of the planimeter , you get the area inside the curve .
The next figure gives you a better view of the mechanism .
We call the carriage the assembly of wheels , dial , and pivot .
In the next picture you get a better look at it , and can see the worm drive that causes the dial to rotate as the measuring wheel moves .
Here is the diagram of the original planimeter , from the article by Jakob Amsler that introduced it :
How can such a simple thing measure areas ?
Geometry of the planimeter
The clockwise movement of the planimeter is the direction opposite to what mathematicians have decided should be positive rotation .
Rather than violate this convention , we are going to work from now on with a mathematician 's planimeter , in which you move counter - clockwise .
Like other mathematicians ' fantasies , there are none on the planet !
There are some restrictions on how to place the planimeter with respect to the curve you want to trace .
The carriage can be slid along the tracer arm , but in all cases the length l of the tracer arm is less than that the length r of the pole arm .
This means that the tracer can never get within a distance r - l of the pole .
On the other hand , when it is fully extended , the tracer can never reach beyond r + l .
So the curve to be traced must lie within the annulus between two circles , one with radius r - l , the other r + l .
In fact , it should become clear in a moment that the arms should never be completely extended , so the curve to be traced must lie completely inside the annulus .
Furthermore , normally the pole is placed on the outside of the curve .
For a given point in the annulus there are exactly two possible configurations of the planimeter that place the tracer on that point .
Choosing one point or the other means choosing a sign for a square root .
We call this choosing an orientation for the planimeter .
It is positive if the square root is positive .
Once an orientation has been chosen , it will remain the same unless the arm is fully extended .
This must never happen .
As long as your curve is entirely within the annulus , the configurations of the planimeter will vary smoothly and uniquely with the path of the tracer .
The next thing to do is to understand a few things about the motion of the measuring wheel .
As the following picture shows , if the wheel travels in a straight line a distance C , the wheel rotates through an angle θ = C/R where R is its radius .
So it is really true that the rotation of the wheel and the distance traveled by the tracer arm have some relationship to each other .
But this relationship is a bit subtle .
If the arm just moves straight ahead a distance C , the area swept out will be lC , but if it shifts parallel to itself the area swept out will be 0 .
In the first case , a point on the circumference of the wheel will move distance C .
In the second case , the wheel will not move at all .
And if the arm translates obliquely , the wheel will rotate a distance equal to the altitude of the parallelogram covered by the arm .
In all cases where the arm translates parallel to itself , the area swept out by the portion of the tracer arm between the pivot and the tracer will be equal to lC , where C is the distance measured by the rotation of the wheel .
This is the basic fact relating the arm 's motion to the motion of the measuring wheel .
The way to phrase this precisely is that no matter how the the arm moves , the distance measured by the wheel is the path integral
where Γ is the path traveled by the point of the arm where the measuring wheel is attached , n is the unit vector perpendicular to the arm at any moment , and t is the unit vector pointing in the direction of travel ( so that , for example , if the arm is moving parallel to itself the dot product of n and t is 0 ) .
Guldin's Theorem
Next we are going to try to make the behaviour of the planimeter intuitively clear , but first we are going to look at a special kind of planimeter , and in this case prove a more general result .
Suppose we take a single freely moving arm of length l and attach to it a measuring wheel of radius R right in its center .
Then we move the arm around on the plane .
If the measuring wheel rotates through a total angle of θ radians as the arm moves around , the distance a point on the circumference travels is C = θR .
Guldin's Theorem .
In this situation , the total area swept out by the arm is the product lC .
Area here is interpreted with a sign .
If the arm just rotates around its center , one half of the arm goes forward and the other backward , and the two cancel .
We have already seen that Guldin 's assertion is valid in the case the arm just translates .
Of course this does n't always happen - the arm may rotate as it moves as well as translate .
But we can see what is happening by chopping up the swept area as follows :
Because the measuring wheel is in the center of the arm , as the arm rotates , it squishes the little blocks on one side as it expands them on the other .
These effects cancel each other out exactly .
A completely rigorous proof can be given by using the formula for change of variables in a double integral and the expression for wheel travel as a path integral .
Now suppose the wheel is placed somewhere else .
Say its position is c + v where c is the center of the arm , and v a vector along the arm .
The length of v will remain fixed , say at ρ .
The path that the wheel follows is c ( t ) + v( t ) .
The path integral is now
The first integral is the distance the wheel would travel if it were at the center of the arm .
In the second , the vector v(t ) is always perpendicular to n , and v(t ) has constant length .
The vector v(t ) moves around on a circle of radius equal to ρ .
Therefore the dot product of n and v'(t ) is just the signed length of v'(t ) , and the second integral is equal to ρ times the total rotation of the arm .
Hence :
If the wheel is at distance ρ from the center of the arm , the distance C the wheel measures is C 0 , the distance that would be measured if the wheel were at the center , plus ρ times the total angle θ that the arm rotates .
You can see immediately one simple case of this by rotating the arm around its center .
Combining this with Guldin's Theorem , we see that in all cases :
C = C 0 + ρ θ
Area swept out = l C 0 = l C - l ρ θ
The full result
Guldin's Formula gives a signed area - if you sweep backwards over an area , the wheel goes backwards and you cancel area you have already covered .
If we apply this to the case where the free arm comes back exactly to where it started , we see that lC is equal to the area of the closed region traced out by the right end of the arm minus that of the region swept out by the left one .
In the case of the polar planimeter , the bottom of the arm is restricted to an arc of the circle of radius r with center at the pole , hence l C is the area traced out by the tracer .
Furthermore , normally the pole lies outside the region to be measured , and in this case the total amount of rotation of the arm has to be 0 .
So in this case we have
Area of the region traced = lC
Here is the figure included by Jakob Amsler , the inventor , in his original paper on the instrument he invented :
It seems pretty clear from this that Amsler derived his construction through some form of Guldin 's theorem .
Planimeters and Green's Theorem
As we have already mentioned , having chosen the orientation of the planimeter , the planimeter configuration is a continuous function of the tracer position .
Say we choose the positive orientation .
Then we can attach to each point of the annulus a unit vector n , the one pointing counter - clockwise and perpendicular to the tracer arm at the tracer .
How the measuring wheel is going to respond to motion along the curve in the next instant depends on the angle between this vector and the unit tangent vector of the curve .
At A in the picture above , the measuring wheel is not going to move because the motion along the curve is parallel to the tracer arm .
At B if the tracer moves a small distance ds , so will the measuring wheel .
And at C the measuring wheel will move some distance in between 0 and ds .
To be precise , suppose t is the unit tangent vector at some point of the curve .
If the tracer moves distance ds along the curve , at that point the measuring wheel will move a distance d ds , where d = n .
t , the dot product of the unit vectors t and n .
In other words , if we move all around the curve Γ the measuring wheel will move a total distance equal to the integral of n .
t ds ( dot product ) , or
But since every point of the annulus corresponds to a unique positive configuration of the planimeter , we can assign a vector n to every interior point of the annulus , and it therefore defines a vector field .
The curve Γ is the boundary of its interior Ω , and by one of our assumptions this is contained entirely in the region where n is defined .
Green 's
Theorem tells us that the path integral around the boundary of this region is also equal to a certain integral over Ω : Therefore
More precisely , Green 's Theorem tell us that
where n = [ p , q ] is the vector field involved .
The integrand in the double integral is called the curl of the vector field .
This does n't seem to get us very far .
What ought to happen is that the curl is a constant 1 .
In principle , we could find a formula for the vector field n and calculate its curl , but that is n't very enlightening .
We can take advantage of another fact , however .
The vector field has circular symmetry , which means that it is determined by what it is on one radius .
The cosine law gives us a simple formula for the circumferential component .
It follows from simple geometry in this figure that the circumferential component of n is
f ( ρ ) = cos(γ ) = ( ρ 2 + l 2 - r 2 ) / ( 2 ρ l )
The real point of Green 's Theorem is that in order to verify that the integrand is 1 it suffices to verify that the path integral around suitable small paths is the same as the area .
For this , we choose our regions to be as here :
Then l times the path integral is
l ( ρ+dρ ) ( f( ρ+dρ ) - f( ρ ) ) dθ
or
( θ/2 ) ( ( ρ + dρ ) 2 - ρ 2 )
which is the area of the region Ω .
Other kinds of planimeters
Guldin's
Theorem implies that the motion of a measuring wheel will tell you the area traced out by the tracer whenever the arm with a measuring wheel on it traces out a curve but has one end restricted to a one - dimensional curve .
This happens , for example , with the rolling planimeter , in which the pivot is restricted to a straight line by being on a rolling cylinder .

UPDATE from IPS NEWS … just published .
My dear friend and brother Mohammed Omer returned to his native Gaza Strip on Thursday … literally unconscious and unable to speak after being beaten and tortured by Israeli troops .
He is still unable to speak so I was not able to communicate with him , I will be posting updates on his condition in future posts .
Mohammed was in Britain , where he was the recipient of a prize for journalism .
You can read about it
Mohammed ’s ordeal is written about in an Action Alert issued by the Washington Report on Middle East Affairs , a journal in which he appears regularly .
Gaza Correspondent Mohammed Omer Home Again in Rafah
At a June 16 ceremony in London , Mohammed Omer , author of the regular Washington Report feature “ Gaza on the Ground , ” received the 2008 Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism ( a link to the presentation and Omer ’s remarks can be found on our home page , < www.wrmea.com>).
He shared the prestigious prize with independent American journalist Dahr Jamail , who was honored for his “ unembedded ” reports from Iraq .
Before traveling to England to receive his award , Omer spoke in Sweden , the Netherlands and Greece about the situation in Gaza .
Dutch MP
Hans Van Baalen , head of the parliament ’s foreign relations committee , and Pulitzer Prize - winning journalist John Pilger spent weeks lobbying Israel to issue an exit permit to allow this young reporter to travel to Europe and London .
Not for the first time , however , getting home was even harder than leaving .
As soon as Omer arrived in Amman , the Dutch diplomats who were helping facilitate his travel arrangements informed him that the Israelis did not want to allow him to return .
After further intervention by his Dutch sponsors , Omer finally got the green light , and on the morning of June 26 crossed from Jordan into the occupied territories via the Allenby Bridge .
There he was interrogated , strip - searched and manhandled for several hours .
After losing consciousness , he finally was taken to a hospital in Jericho , and from there escorted back to Gaza .
MP Van Baalen has demanded that Israel launch an investigation into Omer ’s barbaric treatment .

Nearly two decades after the Exxon Valdez ran around on Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound , the U.S. Supreme Court has taught Exxon ( now ExxonMobil ) and corporations everywhere a lesson :
Do n’t pay off legal judgments .
Stall , stall , stall for 19 years .
Courts have held that Exxon must pay $ 2.5 billion in punitive damages for spilling 11 million gallons of crude oil that soiled 1,200 miles of Alaskan coastline .
In 1994 a jury found Exxon Valdez captain Joseph Hazelwood and Exxon to be reckless .
Hazelwood , who had been drinking before the single - hulled tanker hit the reef , had left the bridge as the vessel faced a difficult turn .
The jury awarded $ 287 million in compensatory damages and originally $ 5 billion in punitive damages ( later halved by another court ) .
But Exxon should n’t have worried .
The business - tilted Court whacked the already - reduced $ 2.5 billion by four - fifths .
Exxon sought to have the Supreme Court reduce the punitive award â€ ” and it succeeded .
Exxon need shell out only $ 500 million to cover the commercial losses by the 32,677 commercial fishermen , business operators and landowners , Native Alaskans and municipalities party to the high - court case .
Those harmed by Exxon ’s operations in Prince William Sound will receive “ an average of about $ 15,000 a person .
They would have collected an average of $ 75,000 each under the $ 2.5 billion judgment , ” said an Associated Press story .
Justice David Souter , writing for the majority in a 5 - 3 decision , said that any penalty must be “ reasonably predictable ” in its severity .
Hogwash .
Exxon ought to pay dearly for its poor decisions .
Exxon should have known its operation of a single - hulled tanker by a captain with alcohol - related issues would have had “ reasonably predictable ” and severe environmental consequences â€ ” and attendant punitive consequences for the company .
But Exxon told the Court it has paid enough , having spent $ 3.4 billion in response to the vessel ’s grounding that led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of wildlife .
And the court , according to the AP , said “ punitive damages may not exceed what the company already paid to compensate victims for economic losses , about $ 500 million compensation . ” [ emphasis added ]
What about punishment for the environmental consequences ?
Exxon says its money has left Prince William Sound environmentally sound and thriving .
Others disagree :
The Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council reports that the multi-million dollar herring fish industry , which once supported thousands of lives and livelihoods in the area , remains closed indefinitely .
From the beginning , Exxon acted arrogantly .
Its CEO refused to be interviewed .
It delayed clean - up for two weeks in calm weather and began it in rough weather .
A senior Exxon official did not appear on site for several days .
Exxon spent $ 1.8 million for full - page ads in 166 newspapers ; it apologized but failed to accept responsibility .
Over the years , Exxon has spent nearly $ 2 billion on public - relations efforts to evade responsibility and repair its image .
It has paid lawyers dearly for nearly 20 years to stall paying what victims are due by appealing court decision after decision .
Between PR and lawyers , Exxon ’s probably shelled out more than the original $ 5 billion punitive judgment .
Exxon delayed in any way it could , and low and behold , conservatism took hold in the Supreme Court .
Exxon today found its punitive financial liability a mere pittance , only 10 percent of the original jury award .
Moral : Stall , stall , stall …
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is ecstatic .
In a press release , it presaged the future :
â€ œThis is good news for companies concerned about reining in excessive punitive damages , â€ said Tom Donohue , president and CEO of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce .
â€ œFor years the Chamber has argued that punitive damages are too unpredictable and unfair , and today the Court agreed .
â€ â€ œThe decision could have an effect far beyond federal maritime law , â€ according to Robin Conrad , executive vice President of the National Chamber Litigation Center .
â€ œLimiting punitive damages to no more than the amount of a compensatory award will go a long way in cabining unpredictable punitive damages .â€ 
[ The NCLC is the chamber ’s public policy law firm . ]
So corporations may continue to soil air , water and land and not fear “ unpredictable and unfair ” punitive judgments , thanks to Exxon ’s intransigence and the rightward tilt of the Court .
ExxonMobil continues to operate a single - hulled tanker in the vicinity of the Prince William spill .
It is the only company to do so .
In 2007 , ExxonMobil earned a profit of $ 40.6 billion on sales of $ 404 billion .
It earned $ 1,287 in profit for every second of 2007 , according to a NYT story .
This has been a perfect storm : Exxon ’s risky Valdez escapade , its delaying tactics over two decades , and the rise of a conservative judiciary friendly to business has left those suffering social , financial , cultural and environmental costs with nothing but a Court - shredded oil boom to protect them .

( CNN ) --
The head of the UN nuclear watchdog berated U.S. officials Friday for failing to share earlier that they had evidence that allegedly shows North Korea helped Syria develop a nuclear reactor .
U.S. officials say the video shows a Syrian nuclear site .
U.S. intelligence officials only told the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) on Thursday of its belief that a building destroyed by Israel was in fact a nuclear facility , Mohamed ElBaradei said .
That was the same day the information was given to legislators and reporters .
Syria is rejecting the accusation that it was building a reactor .
CNN 's Chief International Correspondent Christiane Amanpour talked to American Morning 's John Roberts about the controversy .
ROBERTS :
What do we know about what was going on in Syria ?
AMANPOUR : First of all , Israel did strike that building in Syria on September 6 .
We broke the fact and confirmed it on September 11 of 2007 .
Israel had really put down draconian military censorship on its own press .
The U.S. was n't talking , but very quickly we found out both the United States and Israel thought that was a nascent nuclear plant .
The question has been why did n't they brief the international community and , indeed , the IAEA .
The other question that 's being asked right now is , since everybody has known about this ... the U.S. , Israel , and the Europeans have been able to share intelligence , this is a seven - month - old issue .
Why is it being broadcast now ?
ROBERTS : The United States claims this was a nascent nuclear plant modeled on the Yongbyon facility in Pyongyang .
What about the veracity of the U.S. claims ?
They got it so wrong when it came to what was going on in Iraq .
We also found out that they were wrong about what was going on in Iran .
They say they 've now clarified that .
So are we to be certain that what they say about this place is true ?
AMANPOUR : That 's a very good question , and , in fact , those who are concerned about nuclear proliferation are concerned about the track record of the administration when it comes to credibility on these issues of weapons of mass destruction .
However , having said that , there are a good number of people who do believe that was a nascent nuclear facility .
Perhaps it was n't quite ready to come online , according to others who I have spoken to .
It did not have all the final and full elements that would actually link it as a nuclear facility .
But nonetheless , most people do believe it was a nuclear facility .
The real question right now , John , is how does it affect the very serious negotiations that are going on between the United States and North Korea to de-arm and disarm North Korea 's nuclear plant .
I was in North Korea in February .
We did get an exclusive look with another news agency at Yongbyon .
That plant is disabled .
There are American experts there monitoring and supervising that .
I also spoke with North Korea 's chief nuclear negotiator just after I had been at the plant , and he assured us that those diplomatic negotiations are going ahead to try to disarm North Korea .
ROBERTS : But again , this idea that they were helping Syria build this plant out there in the Syrian desert gives more cause for alarm and this issue of proliferation -- that while North Korea may be entering negotiations into disabling and dismantling their facilities , at the same time they appear to still be trying to help out other countries develop nuclear power .
AMANPOUR : Well , this is one of the issues that the United States is looking into during its negotiations right now .
They want to know not just about all the plutonium the North Koreans have been able to make and weaponize .
They also want to know about what proliferation activities they may have had .
I think we need to watch in the next few days as to how North Korea is going to react to this presentation of these photos by members of the U.S. intelligence and others yesterday .
Is North Korea going to use that briefing to scuttle back these negotiations and get back under its shell or is it going to be able to sit tight and proceed with the nuclear negotiations with the United States as they say they have been going well .
Analysts have said that the kindest reason to suggest that hardliners in the U.S. administration decided to release this information just now is to strengthen the U.S. negotiation bargaining hand .
But they 're more fearing that , in fact , a sharply different reason is underfoot , and that 's to scuttle these negotiations because , as you know , there 's an element within the administration who believes that North Korea should not be talked to and they should be squeezed and basically have a regime change .

Science & Exploration Listen to Phoenix descend
28/05/2008 4022 views 4 likes
With data recorded on board Mars Express , you can hear Phoenix descend on to the surface of the Red Planet .
After being processed by the Mars Express Flight Control Team , the sounds of Phoenix descending are audible , loud and clear .
Listen now
The data from the Mars Express Lander Communication system ( MELACOM ) that tracked Phoenix was received on Earth soon after the Phoenix landing .
As Mars Express flew over
This animation shows the signal of Phoenix ’s descent , recorded by MELACOM .
The spike in the animation , between frequencies of 7 and 8 kiloHertz , shows the transmission from Phoenix itself .
The lander can be seen in the animation starting from about 342 s after the start time and disappears at about 1085 s.
This shows Mars Express picking up on the Phoenix signal and tracking it while closing in on the lander ; the closest Mars Express got to Phoenix was 1550 km .
As Mars Express flew away , the lander deployed its parachute , separated from it and landed , the signal from the lander was cut off .
The shift of the spike seen in the animation , is due to the so - called Doppler effect , which is very similar to what we hear when listening to the whistle of a passing train .
The signal was tracked successfully , even during the expected transmission blackout window of the descent , until the lander was out of Mars Express ’s view .
The transmission blackout window is caused because of ionisation around the probe , which builds up as the lander descends through the atmosphere and only very weak signals come through .
The rest of the recording , the start and the end , contains background noise generated by Mars Express itself .
Science observations Mars Express During the descent , all of the capabilities of Mars Express were focussed on tracking Phoenix with MELACOM .
Unfortunately , the science observations carried out during the descent did not lead to the anticipated results .
Apart from these observations , the Planetary Fourier Spectrometer ( PFS ) on board Mars Express has been collecting relevant data since 8 May this year in anticipation of the Phoenix landing .
This includes information on the physical conditions of the Martian atmosphere ( temperature , pressure and density ) above the expected the landing site .
This data was provided to NASA in support of their observations of the physical conditions in the atmosphere prior to landing .
Over the next few days , Mars Express will monitor Phoenix using MELACOM 15 more times ; at least one of these will be used to demonstrate and confirm that the ESA spacecraft can be used as a data relay station for NASA , receiving data from the surface and transmitting test commands to the lander .
Detailed information about the descent and landing will be available once the data from all the fly - overs is processed and analysed over the next few weeks .
Notes for editors :
The processing and interpretation of the data by the Mars Express Flight Control Team is the result of the joint work of the signal processing team of ESA ’s Ground Stations Systems division and with the Flight Dynamics team at ESA 's European Space Operations Centre .
Hello everyone , I ’m Aaron Orsak , US Producer of SingStar , and I ’ve just arrived back
from a hugely successful Coachella SingStar PlayStation 3 event .
I just wanted to confirm what some of you may have read on 1UP , and recap a bit for you guys what we announced while at Coachella last week .
Yes , SingStar PS3 is finally coming to the US and Canada on May 20 and includes full access to the SingStore and , most importantly , My SingStar Online .
In addition to the 30 songs on the disc , the US SingStore will have approximately 200 downloadable songs priced each at $ 1.49 .
When you think that you ’re getting the song PLUS the video by the original artist PLUS it ’s all fully playable via SingStar , it ’s a great value .
And , the cool thing is , our goal is to add 25 to 50 new songs to the SingStore every month .
Initial feedback on the songlist has been pretty positive , and we ’re definitely interested in hearing from you guys on what you ’d like to see on the SingStore .
And then there ’s My SingStar Online for those that are n’t camera shy …
My SingStar Online houses your global SingStar identity , and by using the PlayStation Eye you can view , rate , and even post favorite videos , audio recordings , and snapshots to the global SingStar community .
Believe me , you can have a lot of fun checking out videos from all over the globe and coming up with your own creative ideas .
Over 20,000 videos already have been uploaded to the community since the European launch this past December .
One last bit of news I wanted to share is that we ’ll be adding new features day 1 of launch via a free patch for the US , Canada , and Europe .
Cool new features include enhanced harmony duets , separate Battle mode difficulty selections , a lag calibration feature for different TV types , and even PSP remote play .
You may be thinking , “ what ’s the deal with remote play ? ”
Well , with remote play you can browse , stream and remotely launch downloads from the SingStore so you ’ve got your party list ready to go by the time you arrive home .
You also can check out your profile on My SingStar Online and view other performances shared in the online community .
Look forward to seeing you all online come May 20 and check out the pics from our weekend at Coachella .
More to come shortly , guys … so stay tuned …
Linus Torvalds has released version 2.6.25 of the Linux kernel .
“ It ’s been long promised , but there it is now .
Special thanks to Ingo who found and fixed a nasty - looking regression that turned out to not be a regression at all , but an old bug that just had not been triggering as reliably before .
” As usual , KernelNewbies provides a readable changelog that we can all understand .
They sum up the most important changes in 2.6.25 as follows :
“ Summary : 2.6.25 includes support of a new architecture ( MN10300 / AM33 ) and the widely used Orion SoCs , a new interface for more accurate measurement of process memory usage , a ‘ memory resource controller ’ for controlling the memory usage of groups of processes , realtime group scheduling , a tool for measuring high latencies called latencytop , ACPI thermal regulation , timer event notifications through file descriptors , an alternative MAC security framework called SMACK , a ext4 update , BRK and PIE - executable address space randomization , RCU preemption support , FIFO spinlocks in x86 , EFI support in x86 - 64 , a new network protocol called CAN , initial ATI r500 DRI / DRM support , improved device support and many other small improvements . ”
Head on over there for a much more detailed list of all the new features .
If you ’re really die - hard , you can check the original , unformatted changelog too .

Sometimes , making a name for yourself with a particular genre or subject can come back to bite you .
It 's more than likely that not every single title you make will live up to this particular reputation , and the ones that are far off the mark will appear as a large albatross on an otherwise sterling record .
Haze is such a burden placed on the otherwise acclaimed development team at Free Radical , whose many employees have worked on GoldenEye 007 and Perfect Dark , not to mention establishing its acclaimed TimeSplitters franchise .
While Free Radical 's previous work was quite excellent , Haze is anything but , coming across as a middling , generic first - person shooter with bland visuals , a weak plot and laughable characters .
Haze is the story of Shane Carpenter , a young Mantel soldier that 's dispatched , along with the rest of his squad , to the Boa Region of South America .
The largest PMC in the world , Mantel has an army of enhanced warriors boosted with their specialized " supplement " known as Nectar .
With a large force at its disposal , Mantel has been asked to go in and pacify the region from the dangerous " Promise Hand " , a militant group of rebels headed up by the villainous Skin Coat ( so named because he enjoys skinning his victims and wearing them ) .
However , Carpenter finds that his mission to " liberate the hearts and minds " of the indigenous people is not what it appears to be , and after one objective takes an unexpected turn , he finds himself defecting to the rebel cause and fighting against his former

At first glance , this appears to be an interesting premise for a title , giving players a sense of both sides of the conflict .
Unfortunately , its plot is such a hackneyed and feeble amalgamation of concepts that the true impact or commentary that could 've been presented in the title is immediately lost .
For one thing , the Mantel soldiers are presented as your stereotypical jarhead grunts that have no morality or sense of responsibility , killing people because they have always had a genuine bloodlust for death and destruction .
This alpha male broad stroke is painted with comments such as " It 's like taking candy from a crippled baby , " and " Is there an award for most badass gangsta ?
Because that 's me ! "
Forget the liberation of people from terror ; that concept is immediately thrown out of the window , as is any other sense of humanity .
However , Carpenter is n't ever presented with these emotions , regardless of the action he faces or the amount of Nectar in his system .
This makes him stand out like a sore thumb compared to the rest of his unit and immediately weakens the player 's connection as to why they want to even play through these sections .
What 's more , the character of Carpenter does n't endear himself to the player , especially because he either whines his way through sections of missions or seems perpetually lost , making him come across as exceedingly weak and not someone you want to take through the entire game regardless of what happens to him .
It does n't really help in the middle of battle , when you 're dodging bullets or rockets from your former company , to hear Shane complain about not being sure what to do next .
What further widens this disconnect between Shane , the Mantel troops and the player is the deliberate attempt to tie soldier immorality to the blatant use ( and abuse ) of Nectar , making the war seem much more like a videogame than real life .
Supposedly , this explains the behavior of the troops , because they are living in a drug - induced fantasy world that is perpetually extended by their battle armor .
In fact , the only time that you do see soldiers crash from their Nectar high is laughable .
Not laughable because of what the soldiers do , but laughable in the manner in which it 's carried out , which is extremely forced and horribly acted .
That 's unfortunate , because the mechanic of Nectar within the game is actually rather striking .
It heightens Shane 's senses , making enemies stand out from the environment because of their glowing silhouette .
This makes it much easier to snipe enemies or pick them out -- even in dense cover .
Nectar also manages to reduce the amount of damage that you take , as well as warn you of incoming danger thanks to a rippling pulse of energy from grenades or other threats .
Finally , Nectar makes you much stronger , and any melee attacks are radically stronger than ever before .
What 's more , every kill that you make on the Nectar high provides you with an additional boost of power to maintain your buzz .
That gives you somewhat of an incentive to continue blasting any enemy soldiers that cross your path , as long as you do n't accidentally overdose on the initial injection of the drug into your system .
This will cause you to lose control of Shane for a while as he shoots at friend and foe alike .

ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) --
Like many young men , Josh Nahum loved a thrill .
That 's why he took up skydiving .
But on Labor Day weekend in 2006 , he had an accident while skydiving in Colorado , fracturing his femur and skull .
Josh Nahum , right , died at 27 from a bacterial infection he got while being treated for skydiving injuries .
Josh spent six weeks in the intensive care unit .
Slowly , his condition improved , and his doctors predicted that with rehabilitation , he could fully recover in a year or two .
But instead of recovering , Josh developed a bacterial infection .
He died two weeks later at the age of 27 .
" One nurse , who was trying to be comforting , said , ' These things happen , ' " says Victoria Nahum , Josh 's stepmother .
" That 's true , but they happen way more often than they need to happen . "
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , Josh is one of 99,000 people who die each year because of infections acquired in the hospital .
As Betsy McCaughey , the former lieutenant governor of New York , put it , " You do n't often come across such a big problem that you can prevent . "
After being contacted by families like the Nahums , McCaughey started the Committee to Reduce Infection Deaths .
After Josh died , the Nahums started the Safe Care Campaign .
These groups , and others , have advice about what you can do to keep yourself safe in the doctor 's office and hospital , from the waiting room to the operating room .
1. Bring your own toys
At the pediatrician 's office , do n't let your child play with the toys or books in the waiting room .
" They 're covered with bacteria , " McCaughey says .
Also , do n't let your child crawl on the floor ; bacteria there could get into cuts on their knees or hands .
" This is one place you ought to keep your child sitting still or on your lap , " she says .
2 . Heat up your car
Yes , we know that sounds strange .
But studies show staying warm before and during surgery can help you fight infection .
So the Institute for Healthcare Improvement suggests that in cold weather , you heat up the car , wear warm clothes on the way to the hospital , ask the hospital staff to give you plenty of blankets while you wait for surgery , and ask how they plan to keep you warm during surgery .
3 . Want to touch me ?
Wash your hands first .
Many people feel uncomfortable asking this .
Nahum suggests putting it like this : " I did n't see you wash your hands .
Do you mind doing it in front of me ? "
Dr. Vicki Rackner , a patient advocate , also has a few ideas for lightening things up .
" In the hospital , you can have the grandkids make a sign that says , ' Please wash your hands and keep Grandma healthy . ' " Watch more on preventing hospital infections »
Another suggestion :
Put a dish of wrapped candy near the sink and say ' Could you please wash your hands , and oh , please take some candy with you when we 're done . ' "
If the doctor or nurse has gloves on , are you safe ?
" Do n't be falsely assured by gloves , " McCaughey says .
" If they put on gloves without washing their hands first , those gloves are immediately contaminated . "
4 . Ask where that syringe has been
Doctors offices sometimes reuse syringes -- it 's unusual , but it happens .
In fact , there have been 14 documented outbreaks of hepatitis since 1999 because of reused syringes .
The recent outbreak in Nevada , where 50,000 people will be notified that they might have been infected at a colonoscopy clinic , is one example .
It 's not an easy question to ask , but when someone 's heading at you with a syringe , ask if this is the first time it 's been used .
Dr. Thomas Frieden , commissioner of the New York City Department of Health , suggests phrasing it like this : " I read in the paper that some doctors are reusing syringes .
I can't imagine anyone would do that .
Do you ? "
5 . Having surgery ?
Speak up !
A week or so before surgery , ask your doctor whether you should wash your skin daily with a disinfectant such as chlorhexidine to prepare .
Also , ask whether you should have a nasal or skin swab for MRSA , the superbug that causes many hospital infections .
If you 've got it , you can be treated with antibiotics .
The day of surgery , if the surgical site needs to be shaved , ask to be clippered , not shaved with a razor , which can create nicks where bacteria thrive .
Also on the day of surgery , if your doctor has ordered IV antibiotics just before surgery , make sure you get them , as they 're sometimes forgotten .
Health Library MayoClinic.com : Hospital infections
One last note :
If you or a loved one has a urinary catheter in the hospital , be extra vigilant -- they can become breeding grounds for bacteria .
First , ask if one is truly necessary .
" If the patient is awake and oriented and alert and can use a bedpan , it may not be needed , " says Dr. John Jernigan , a medical epidemiologist at the CDC .
If you get one , make sure it comes out ASAP , since the longer it's in , the riskier it becomes .
Ask the same questions about central venous catheters , ( also called central lines ) , another potential host for bacteria .
" My brother was in the hospital and needed a central venous catheter for his procedure , " Jernigan says .
" The day after surgery , I asked the nurse , ' Are you all still using this ?
Do you still need it ? '
And she checked and came back and said , ' We do n't need it anymore , we 'll take it out . ' "
Nahum says it all boils down to this : Passivity kills .
" People need to start participating instead of just being spectators when it comes to their medical care , " she says .
" You need to do your due diligence . "

Whither macroeconomics ?
The surprising success of naïve GDP forecasts
Jon Faust
Over the past ten days , the U.S. Federal Reserve has lowered its policy interest rate 125 basis points based largely on its assessment of the need to battle strong recessionary forces .
This comes after a December 12 meeting at which the Fed lowered rates a mere 25 basis points , still hoping to “ foster maximum sustainable growth and provide some additional insurance against risks .
1 ” To some , this rapid change in sentiment might seem surprising .
In my view , though , these events mainly serve to remind us of how extraordinarily challenging it is to forecast economic activity .
Economic forecasting challenges
I regularly hear the accusation that economic forecasting is no better than weather forecasting , but this does a disservice to weather forecasters .
It is also an unfair comparison : weather forecasters have immense advantages over economic forecasters .
When making a forecast , weather forecasters have access to data on the current and recent past conditions .
In contrast , when the Fed made the forecast for the January Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) meeting , the latest available GDP data were for the third quarter of the previous year .
On January 30 , we will get an advance release of fourth quarter GDP for the U.S. , but this initial estimate will be highly speculative .
Historically , the root mean square revision of the annualised quarterly growth rate in the advance release is about 1.5 percentage points -- easily enough to spell the difference between slow growth and deep recession .
2
Further , the GDP data will continue to be revised in important ways indefinitely .
For example , the 1999 benchmark revision of GDP data raised measured average growth over 1997 and 1998 by more than one - half of a percentage point . 3
A significant piece of the much - discussed productivity boom of the late 1990s was not in the GDP data until the 1999 benchmark .
The weather equivalent would be forecasting temperature without knowing the current temperature , having only a fuzzy estimate of temperature in the recent past , and knowing that , years after the fact , a hot spell might be revised into the data .
Given that we cannot even measure GDP without considerable hindsight , we cannot expect forecasts of real economic activity to be very precise .
We can and should , however , ask whether Federal Reserve forecasts are as accurate as possible .
How well does the Fed do ?
Research over the years has generally supported the view that the Fed 's Greenbook forecast , prepared for each FOMC meeting , is outstanding .
4
Recently , discovery of a new dataset has made a more stringent evaluation possible .
This dataset has a snapshot of ( part of ) the Fed 's dataset as it stood at the time of about 150 Greenbook forecasts since 1979.5
Using this dataset , Jonathan Wright of the Federal Reserve Board and I assessed how a wide range of models would have performed if they had been used to forecast based on the information actually available to the Fed when it made its forecasts .
6
Our results again confirm the high quality of the Greenbook forecast , but are sobering in some respects .
When we give ten alternative models only those data that were available to the Fed , the Fed 's forecast generally outperforms the alternatives by a wide margin .
Chris Sims and others had speculated that the Fed 's good performance might be due to the immense resources the Fed pours into assessing GDP in the current period and recent past .
Since many of the raw inputs used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis ( BEA ) to construct the GDP data are public , the Fed attempts to assess current GDP by replicating many aspects of the BEA 's efforts .
It is probably not surprising that conventional models have trouble competing regarding current and past conditions with a thorough attempt to mirror the data construction machinery of the BEA .
A surprisingly simple forecast
While the Fed has a clear edge in assessing current conditions , policy decisions can only affect the future .
To assess how the Fed does in projecting where real activity will be in the future , Jonathan and I give the alternative models the data available to the Fed and the Fed 's estimate of the current state of the economy .
Then we compare how well the models forecast when they all know the Fed 's assessment of the current and recent past values of variables .
We find the surprising result that no model clearly outperforms the univariate autoregressive model .
This is one of the simplest possible models : it basically forecasts in every period that the GDP growth will simply follow its historical average rate back to the mean .
This may be sobering for not only the Fed but for the macroeconomics profession as a whole : knowledge of interest rates , labour market conditions , capacity utilisation , inflation , or any of about 50 additional variables does not systematically improve our ability to foretell where real activity is headed .
There are many details and caveats to be considered in fully understanding the meaning of these results .
We can , however , give a bit more precise statement .
The univariate autoregressive model , which predicts GDP growth based on four lagged values of growth , has smaller prediction errors than Greenbook and essentially every other model at every forecast horizon between one and five quarters into the future .
7
Our measure of the prediction error is an estimate , however , and one should consider whether the differences in estimated forecast precision are statistically significant .
This raises complex statistical issues , but our basic conclusion is that no method significantly outperforms the univariate model .
It is important to emphasise that the results for forecasting inflation are dramatically different than those for real activity .
For inflation , Greenbook outperforms all other models , often by a wide margin .
Conclusions
Returning to the weather analogy , our results would translate something like this .
We are forecasting temperature without knowing current temperature and having only a fuzzy estimate of temperature in the recent past .
Further , we find that given a good estimate of recent temperatures , we do not know any systematic way to improve our temperature forecast using measures of other variables such as precipitation , barometric pressure , location of the jetstream , etc .
While necessary , forecasting real activity is a nasty endeavour .
Our recent research confirms the basic conclusion of earlier work that the Fed 's Greenbook forecast is excellent .
No model we assess , however , including Greenbook , historically outperforms a naïve forecast based only on the best available estimate of recent GDP itself .

A paedophile who molested an 11 - year - old girl escaped jail yesterday when a judge ruled the victim had " welcomed " his advances .
Judge Robert Atherton triggered outrage when he told Manchester Crown Court the child had invited Jon Dixon 's attack as she had a " sexual awareness " that would make someone twice her age blush .
The judge rejected an assessment by the probation service that Dixon , 20 , posed a " high risk of serious harm to children " .

Jon Dixon , who groomed and abused an 11 - year - old girl but escaped jail , leaves Manchester Crown Court with an unidentified woman
Claiming the paedophile would not get the treatment he needed in the overcrowded prison service , Judge Atherton sentenced Dixon to a community order .
The judge had earlier referred to a psychologist 's report which claimed Dixon was not a high risk to young girls but needed help .
Last night children 's charities condemned his words .
Michele Elliott , of the child protection charity Kidscape , accused the judge of " partially blaming " the victim and called for him to be removed from hearing cases involving child abuse .
The court heard that the pair met in an internet chatroom called Flirtomatic in February last year where the girl was posing as a 20 - year - old .
Website members can post images , rate other members for attractiveness and send " flirt icons " to initiate online conversations .
Dixon and his victim exchanged 900 text graphic messages over a two - week period before the girl told Dixon she was actually aged 12 - although her real age was 11 .
He continued to pursue her with more graphic sexual text messages , emails and a request for pornographic photos before they met .
Judge Robert Atherton has been criticised after deciding not to send a paedophile who molested an 11 - year - old girl to jail
" It was clear the defendant 's attitude and intentions towards her had not changed despite her saying she was only 12 , " said Jonathan Dickinson , prosecuting .
On March 15 last year Dixon met the girl during her school lunch break and sexually assaulted her .
Two days later they met again when Dixon tried unsuccessfully to rape her in an alleyway .
He was arrested a few days later when the mother of one of the girl 's friends contacted the family after speaking to her own daughter .
Dixon , from Eccles , Greater Manchester , told police he had only kissed the girl at her request but later pleaded guilty to meeting a child following sexual grooming , sexual assault of a child and attempted rape .
Passing the three - year community order , the judge said Dixon had not deliberately sought out a child on the internet .
He said his victim expressed " herself in relation to sexual matters with an awareness which would make many twice her age blush " .
Dixon was also placed on the Sexual - Offenders Register for five years .
Last year Judge Julian
Hall was criticised for jailing a child rapist for only two years , claiming the case was " exceptional " because the ten - year - old victim was dressed provocatively .
The Appeal Court later doubled the sentence .
The age of consent in England and Wales is 16 .
Under current legislation , a male who has sex with a girl under 16 is guilty of unlawful sexual intercourse , even if the girl agrees .
The maximum penalty for the offence is two years in jail .
If the girl is under 13 , the maximum sentence is life .

The term lesbian is now widely used to describe homosexual women Campaigners on the Greek island of Lesbos are to go to court in an attempt to stop a gay rights organisation from using the term " lesbian " .
The islanders say that if they are successful they may then start to fight the word lesbian internationally .
The issue boils down to who has the right to call themselves Lesbians .
Is it gay women , or the 100,000 people living on Greece 's third biggest island - plus another 250,000 expatriates who originate from Lesbos ?
The man spearheading the case , publisher Dimitris Lambrou , claims that international dominance of the word in its sexual context violates the human rights of the islanders , and disgraces them around the world .
He says it causes daily problems to the social life of Lesbos 's inhabitants .
Injunction sought
In court papers , the plaintiffs allege that the Greek government is so embarrassed by the term Lesbian that it has been forced to rename the island after its capital , Mytilini .
An early court date has now been set for judges to decide whether to grant an injunction against the Homosexual and Lesbian Community of Greece and to order it to change its name .
A spokeswoman for the group has described the case as a groundless violation of freedom of expression , and has pledged to fight it .
The term lesbian originated from the poet Sappho , who was a native of Lesbos .
Sappho expressed her love of other women in poetry written during the 7th Century BC .
But according to Mr Lambrou , new historical research has discovered that Sappho had a family , and committed suicide for the love of a man .

Mathematician 's Delight .
Image from 5m@5 hYdez 's flickr account , reproduced with permission .
Walter Warwick Sawyer was a mathematician and author who made a major contribution to mathematical education .
He recently passed away in Canada , aged 97 .
Sawyer was born in 1911 and won scholarships to Highgate School and St John 's College , Cambridge .
After becoming head of mathematics at Leicester College of Technology , he became interested in the applications of mathematics to industry , and developed a scheme in which apprentices learnt mathematics by handling physical objects .
In 1943 he published his first and most successful book Mathematician 's Delight , which has been in continuous publication since and has sold about 500,000 copies .
In 1948 he became the head of mathematics at the University of Ghana , and from 1951 to 1956 he lectured in Canterbury College , New Zealand .
During the period 1957 to 1964 , Sawyer became a loud voice criticising many aspects of mathematics education , and in 1965 was appointed Professor jointly to the Departments of Mathematics and Education in the University of Toronto .
After retiring in 1976 , he wrote his final book , A First Look at Numerical Functional Analysis .
Sawyer was very much concerned with the practical applications of mathematics .
He considered that students taught mathematics without an appreciation of its application would have no more understanding of what they were learning than a machine .
His love of mathematics is seen in the title of his first book , Mathematician 's Delight , whose aim was to " dispel the fear of mathematics " :
" Many people regard mathematicians as a race apart , possessed of almost supernatural powers .
While this is very flattering for successful mathematicians , it is very bad for those who , for one reason or another , are attempting to learn the subject . "
He considered that teachers should work with students ' minds and talents , rather than force foreign concepts on them .
" Education consists in co-operating with what is already inside a child 's mind ...
The best way to learn geometry is to follow the road which the human race originally followed :
Do things , make things , notice things , arrange things , and only then reason about things . "
Sawyer 's understanding of how we learn mathematics , along with his practical approach , has meant that Mathematician 's Delight is one of the most successful introductions to mathematics ever written .
It tackles algebra , graphs , logarithms , trigonometry , calculus and imaginary numbers , all with real - life examples .
Sawyer 's overarching thesis is that the theory within mathematics is not as important as its real - life application — for example , the Pyramids were built on Euclidean principles three thousand years before Euclid formulated them .
An interesting recollection of Sawyer 's explains how it dawned on him as a teacher early in his career that if he could communicate the purpose of mathematics , students would stay interested in his classes :
" In a class I was taking there was one boy who was much older than the rest .
He clearly had no motive to work .
I told him that , if he could produce for me , accurately to scale , drawings of the pieces of wood required to make a desk like the one he was sitting at , I would try to persuade the Headmaster to let him do woodwork during the mathematics hours — in the course of which , no doubt , he would learn something about measurement and numbers .
Next day , he turned up with this task completed to perfection .
This I have often found with pupils ; it is not so much that they cannot do the work , as that they see no purpose in it . "
( A European Education )
In Mathematician 's Delight he compared learning mathematics without context to a deaf child learning to play the piano :
" Nearly every subject has a shadow , or imitation .
It would , I suppose , be quite possible to teach a deaf and dumb child to play the piano .
When it played a wrong note , it would see the frown of its teacher , and try again .
But it would obviously have no idea of what it was doing , or why anyone should devote hours to such an extraordinary exercise .
It would have learnt an imitation of music , and it would fear the piano exactly as most students fear what is supposed to be mathematics .
What is true of music is also true of other subjects .
One can learn imitation history — kings and dates , but not the slightest idea of the motives behind it all ; imitation literature — stacks of notes on Shakespeare 's phrases , and a complete destruction of the power to enjoy Shakespeare . "
In his book , A Concrete Approach to Abstract Algebra , Sawyer explains how practical examples are the key setting up a mathematics course , and how , even if this takes longer , it is a better approach than simply stating " every axiom " as the student will be able to apply mathematics in other areas of life :
" In planning such a course , a professor must make a choice .
His aim may be to produce a perfect mathematical work of art , having every axiom stated , every conclusion drawn with flawless logic , the whole syllabus covered .
This sounds excellent , but in practice the result is often that the class does not have the faintest idea of what is going on .
Certain axioms are stated .
How are these axioms chosen ?
Why do we consider these axioms rather than others ?
What is the subject about ?
What is its purpose ?
If these questions are left unanswered , students feel frustrated .
Even though they follow every individual deduction , they cannot think effectively about the subject .
The framework is lacking ; students do not know where the subject fits in , and this has a paralyzing effect on the mind . "
" On the other hand , the professor may choose familiar topics as a starting point .
The students collect material , work problems , observe regularities , frame hypotheses , discover and prove theorems for themselves .
The work may not proceed so quickly ; all topics may not be covered ; the final outline may be jagged .
But the student knows what he is doing and where he is going ; he is secure in his mastery of the subject , strengthened in confidence of himself .
He has had the experience of discovering mathematics .
He no longer thinks of mathematics as static dogma learned by rote .
He sees mathematics as something growing and developing , mathematical concepts as something continually revised and enriched in the light of new knowledge .
The course may have covered a very limited region , but it should leave the student ready to explore further on his own . "
His books include :
NEW YORK , April 25 ( UPI ) --
Large numbers of Americans face the prospect of energy shutoffs during the coming months because of rising energy prices and stagnant wages , officials said .
Millions of U.S. consumers are behind on paying their utility bills following a winter in which many struggled to cover the increasing cost of heating their homes , The New York Times reported Friday , citing energy and utilities officials .

The cost of heating oil , propane and kerosene is the biggest problem , officials told the newspaper , but natural gas and electricity prices are also a problem for workers at the lower end of the income scale , who are also struggling with higher prices for food and gasoline .
New Hampshire officials said the state will issue grants under the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program to about 34,500 people this heating season -- a record number that is 5 percent higher than last year 's total .
Mark Wolfe , director of the National Energy Assistance Directors ' Association , told the newspaper the most immediate challenge is to help people who are significantly behind in paying their gas and electric bills .
" Based on discussions with major utility companies around the country , we will see record numbers of families facing shutoffs , " said Wolfe .
Facebook ’s CTO D’Angelo to Leave
Facebook CTO Adam D’Angelo will leave the company .
BoomTown called Facebook PR last week about the rumor of D’Angelo ’s departure , but did not get a response .
The company confirmed the departure by D’Angelo ( pictured here ) tonight .
The 23 - year - old D’Angelo , the top tech exec for the social - networking site , will be leaving the company to take some time off .
He has known Facebook Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg since high school .
D’Angelo wrote a letter to Facebook staff on Friday about the move .
He said he wanted a break .
But , according to sources close to the company , D’Angelo felt his responsibilities no longer fit well with his skills and interests .
There were rumors of some tension with Zuckerberg , who is still in India on a long work and personal trip around the world .
But sources said D’Angelo simply wanted to do something different .
D’Angelo said in his letter that he would remain a strong and enthusiastic supporter of the much - hyped start - up .
Facebook will not be replacing the CTO role , sources said , but has a search underway for a VP of engineering .
The quiet , self - effacing D’Angelo should get a lot of credit for Facebook ’s elegant and robust architecture .
As I wrote about him in mini-profiles of Facebook ’s execs :
Chief Technology Officer Adam D’Angelo , a longtime Zuckerberg pal .
He ’s in charge of keeping Facebook from breaking apart as it grows , kind of like Scotty in ‘ Star Trek . ’
But there ’s no warp drive that can save the site from all those surly college students and surlier Silicon Valley types if it all went kerflooey .
His Facebook bio says the computer - science grad from the California Institute of Technology was one of the ‘ top 24 finalists in the Topcoder Collegiate Challenge , which tests the ability to design and implement complex algorithms in a timed environment . ’
Color me impressed , even though I have no idea what that means . ”
The very talented Eric Eldon at VentureBeat also had the story on D’Angelo ’s departure with some more details about the young techie .
Climate change is the obvious contemporary parallel with acid rain .
But if the Democrats really want to pin the denialist label on John McCain , health care is the place to focus .
The health care situation , in case you have n’t noticed , is going from bad to worse .
Many smaller companies stopped offering benefits between 2000 and 2005 .
In the past , health coverage has tended to improve when the economy recovers from recession  but the “ Bush boom ” brought at best a temporary stabilization .
And now that the economy is weakening again , another plunge is in progress : last week UnitedHealth warned investors that its business is suffering because fewer employers are offering coverage to their workers .
The Democrats have been offering real plans in response ; they ’re not perfect , but they are serious .
The G.O.P. , by contrast  and this goes as much for Mr. McCain as for the Bush administration  has n’t even tried to address concerns about coverage .
Instead , it has all been about costs , which Republicans insist ( wrongly ) can be dramatically reduced by a policy of , you guessed it , deregulation and tax cuts .
Until a few days ago , the only answer the McCain campaign offered to those worried about lack of coverage was the vague , implausible assertion that the magic of the marketplace would make health care cheap enough for everyone to afford .
Now Mr. McCain has admitted that maybe a government program is needed for those who ca n’t get private insurance .
This appears to be a response to criticism from Elizabeth Edwards , who has been pointing out that deregulated insurers would deny coverage to anyone with , say , a history of cancer  a category that includes both her and Mr. McCain himself .
But the way Mrs. Edwards has rattled the McCain campaign is evidence of just how vulnerable he is on the issue .

The arc of the moral universe is long , but it bends toward justice .
“ ” Martin Luther King Jr .
People who 've been following me on Twitter know that I 've been spending my weekends turning RSS Bandit into a desktop client for Google Reader and NewsGator Online .
Although I was familiar with NewsGator 's SOAP API , I did n't have the patience to figure out the differences in using SOAP services that had been made in Visual Studio 2008 given the last time I tried it I was using Visual Studio 2003 and there seemed to be fairly significant differences .
In addition , the chance to program against a fully featured RESTful API also piqued my curiosity .
For these reasons I decided to use the NewsGator REST API when working on the features for synchronizing with NewsGator Online .
After I completed work on the synchronization with NewsGator Online , it was quite clear to me that the developer (s ) who designed the NewsGator REST API did n't really understand the principles behind building RESTful services .
For the most part , it looks like a big chunk of the work done to create a REST API was to strip the SOAP envelopes from their existing SOAP services and then switch to URL parameters instead of using SOAP messages for requests .
This is n't REST , it is POX / HTTP ( Plain Old XML over HTTP ) .
Although this approach gets you out of the interoperability and complexity tax which you get from using XSD / SOAP / WS -* , it does n't give you all of the benefits of conforming to the Web 's natural architecture .
So I thought it would be useful to take a look at some aspects of the NewsGator REST API and see what is gained / lost by making them more RESTful .
What Should a Feed Reader 's REST API Look Like ?
Before the NewsGator REST API can be critiqued , it is a good idea to have a mental model of what the API would look like if it was RESTful .
To do this , we can follow the steps in Joe Gregorio 's How to Create a REST Protocol which covers the four decisions you must make as part of the design process for your service
What are the URIs ?
[ Ed note - This is actually " What are the resources ? " ]
What 's the format ?
What methods are supported at each URI ?
What status codes could be returned ?
There are two main resources or data types in a feed reader ; feeds and subscription lists .
When building RESTful protocols , it pays to reuse standard XML formats for your message payloads since it increases the likelihood that your clients will have libraries and tools for dealing with your payloads .
Standard formats for feeds are RSS and Atom ( either is fine although I 'd prefer to go with Atom ) and a standard format for feed lists is OPML .
In addition , there are bits of state you want to associate with feeds ( e.g. what items have been read / unread / flagged / etc ) and with subscription lists ( e.g. username / password of authenticated feeds , etc ) .
Since the aforementioned XML formats are extensible , this is not a problem to accommodate .
What methods to support also seems straightforward .
You will want full Create , Retrieve , Update and Delete operations on the subscription list .
So you will need the full complement of supporting POST , GET , PUT and DELETE on subscription lists .
For feeds , you will only need to fetch them and update the user - specific associated with each feed such as if an item has been read or flagged .
So you 'd want to support GET and PUT / POST .
The question of what error codes to return would probably be at least 200 OK ( success ) , 304 Not Modified ( feeds have n't changed since last fetch ) , 400 Bad Request ( invalid or missing request parameters ) ,401 Unauthorized ( invalid or no authentication credentials provided ) and 404 Not Found ( self explanatory ) .
This seems like a textbook example of a situation that calls for using the Atom Publishing Protocol ( AtomPub ) .
The only wrinkle would be that AtomPub requires uploading the entire document with changes when updating the state of an item or media resource .
This is pretty wasteful when updating the state of an item in an RSS feed ( e.g. indicating that the user has read the item ) since you 'd end up re-uploading all the content of the item just to change the equivalent of a flag on the item .
There have been a number of proposals and workarounds proposed for this limitation of AtomPub such as the HTTP PATCH Internet Draft and Astoria 's introduction of a MERGE HTTP method .
In thinking about this problem , I 'm going to assume that the ideal service supports partial updates of feed and subscription documents using PATCH / MERGE or something similar .
Now we have enough of a background to thoughtfully critique some of the API design choices in the NewsGator API .
REST API Sin # 1 : URIs Identify Methods Instead of Resources ( The Original Sin )
When a lot of developers think of REST they do not think of the REpresentational State Transfer ( REST ) architectural style as described in chapter five of Roy Fieldings '
Ph.D thesis .
Instead they think of exposing remote procedure calls ( RPC ) over the Web using plain old XML payloads , without schemas and without having to use an interface definition language ( i.e XML - based RPC without the encumbrance of SOAP , XSD or WSDL ) .
The problem with this thinking is that it often violates the key idea behind REST .
In a RESTful Web service , the URIs identify the nouns ( aka resources ) that occur in the service and the verbs are the HTTP methods that operate on those resources .
In an RPC - style service , the URLs identify verbs ( aka methods ) and the nouns are the parameters to these methods .
The problem with the RPC style design is that it increases the complexity of the clients that interact with the system .
Instead of a client simply knowing how to interact with a single resource ( e.g. an RSS feed ) and then signifying changes in state by the addition / removal of data in the document ( e.g. adding an < is - read > true < / is - read > element as an extension to indicate an item is read ) , it has to specifically target each of the different behaviors a system supports for that item explicitly ( e.g. client needs to code against markread ( ) , flagitem ( ) , shareitem ( ) , rateitem ( ) , etc ) .
The reduced surface area of the interface is not only a benefit to the client but to the service as well .
Below are a few examples which contrast the approach taken by the NewsGator API with a more RESTful method based on AtomPub .
1a ) Modifying the name of one of the locations a user synchronizes data from using the Newsgator RESTful API
Service URL http://services.newsgator.com/ngws/svc/Location.aspx/<locationId>/ changelocationnamebylocationid Method POST Request Format application/x-www- form- urlencoded
Payload " locationname= < new location name > ” Response No response
1b . ) Modifying the name of one of the locations a user synchronizes data from using a more RESTful approach
Service URL http://services.newsgator.com/ngws/svc/Location.aspx/<locationId>/
Method POST Request Format application / xml
Payload < opml xmlns:ng = " http://newsgator.com/schema/opml " >
< head /> < body >
< outline text = " < location name > " ng:isPublic= " < True| False > " ng:autoAddSubs= " < True| False > " /> </ body > </opml > Response

Method DELETE
Request Format application /x-www - form - urlencoded
Payload " fld= < NewsGator folder id > " Response No response
2b . ) Deleting a folder using a more RESTful approach

Payload Not applicable Response No response
3a . ) Retrieve a folder or create it if it does n't exist using the NewsGator REST API
Service URL http://services.newsgator.com/ngws/svc/Folder.aspx/getorcreate
Method POST Request Format application /x-www - form - urlencoded Payload " parentid= < NewsGator folder id > &name= < folder name > &root= < MYF|MYC >" Response < opml xmlns:ng = " http://newsgator.com/schema/opml " > < head > < title>getorcreate</title > </ head > < body >
< outline text= " < folder name > " ng:id= " < NewsGator folder id > " /> </ body > </opml >
3b . ) Retrieve a folder or create it if it does n't exist using a more RESTful approach ( the approach below supports creating multiple and / or nested folders in a single call )
Service URL http://services.newsgator.com/ngws/svc/Folder.aspx/<root>/<folder-id>
Method POST Request Format application / xml Payload < opml xmlns:ng = " http://newsgator.com/schema/opml " >

< outline text= " < folder name > " ng:id= " < NewsGator folder id > " /> </ body > </opml >
REST API Sin # 2 : Not Providing a Consistent Interface ( A Venial Sin )
In REST , all resources are interacted with using the same generic and uniform interface ( i.e. via the HTTP methods - GET , PUT , DELETE , POST , etc ) .
However it defeats the purpose of exposing a uniform interface if resources in the same system respond very differently when interacting with them using the same HTTP method .
Consider the following examples taken from the NewsGator REST API .
1. ) Deleting a folder using the NewsGator REST API
Service URL http://services.newsgator.com/ngws/svc/Folder.aspx/delete
Method DELETE
Request Format application /x-www - form - urlencoded
Payload " fld= < NewsGator folder id > " Response No response
2. ) Deleting a feed using the NewsGator REST API
Service URL http://services.newsgator.com/ngws/svc/Subscription.aspx
Method DELETE
Request Format application / xml
Payload < opml xmlns:ng = " http://newsgator.com/schema/opml " > < head > < title > delete </ title > </ head > < body > < outline text =” subscription title ” ng:id= ” < NewsGator subscription id > ” ng:statusCode = ” < 0|1 > ” /> </ body > </opml > Response
No response
From the end user or application developer 's perspective the above actions are n't fundamentally different .
In both cases , the user is removing part of their subscription list which in turn deletes some subset of the < outline > elements in the user 's subscriptions OPML file .
However the NewsGator REST API exposes this fundamentally identical task in radically different ways for deleting folders versus subscriptions .
The service URL is different .
The request format is different .
Even the response is different .
There 's no reason why all three of these can't be the same for both folders and subscriptions in a user 's OPML feed list .
Although it may seem like I 'm singling out the NewsGator REST API , I 've seen lots of REST APIs that have similarly missed the point when it comes to using REST to expose a uniform interface to their service .
Conclusion
These are n't the only mistakes developers make when designing a REST API , they are just the most common ones .
They often are a sign that the developers simply ported some old or legacy API without actually trying to make it RESTful .
This is the clearly case with the NewsGator REST API which is obviously a thin veneer over the NewsGator SOAP API .
If you are going to build a RESTful API , do it right .
Your developers will thank you for it .
Now Playing : Montell Jordan - This is How We Do It
Click above for more high - res shots of the Audi R8 The Audi R8 has supercar looks and red - hot demand , so if you want to own the stunning German two - seater , you 'd best get to the back of the line .
Buyers of the mid-engine Audi have picked up every model that will be made for months , which tells us what we already knew : the R8 is a legitimate smash hit .
Oddly , Audi is n't specifying how many R8s it has sold since the vehicle 's introduction , and it's likely the German automaker wo n't go out of its way to ramp up production and risk ruining the all - wheel - drive supercar 's buzz - factor .
It 's no surprise that the R8 is so successful on the sales floor , but the downside is that the vehicle 's sustained popularity is keeping higher performance editions off the market .
If a 420 - hp 4.2L powerplant can take you to 60 mph in 4.4 seconds , just imagine what a 580 - hp twin - turbo V10 will do on dry pavement .
Putting It Altogether
One last piece of advice before we get hands on : reference your manuals .
Or put another way , do n’t be afraid to search for more info while building your PC if you are uncomfortable .
Building computers– especially for beginners– can get overwhelming and fast .
Thankfully , if you are uncertain about how to do a particular step , there are a lot of resources .
Of course , you can reference your manuals , go to the website for the part in question , search forums , etc .
Moreover , you might find that the visual aspect of YouTube videos helps you better understand exactly what you are supposed to do .
1. Breaking the Case
Well , not literally breaking it– more like stripping it down .
Taking the Phanteks P400S ATX Mid Tower Case as an example …
Step 1 : Unscrew the front panel and 2 side panels using the # 2 Phillips screwdriver
Step 2 : Place the screws in a bowl or a mini magnetic parts tray
Step 3 : Remove the panels and place them on a safe surface or just put them back inside the case box
Step 4 : Remove the top magnetic dust filters
Now at this point , you ’ll want to familiarize the case ’s layout ( like I usually do ) , such as where the SSDs and HDDs go , the direction where the power supply ’s exhaust should be facing , the mounts , and which standoffs to use to fit your motherboard .
This should give you a general idea where things should go and which holes the cables should be routed to .

2. Power Supply Unit ( PSU ) Installation
Get your power supply and check which cables you ’ll be using for later ( if you ’re using a semi- modular or fully modular PSU ) .
Unlike other parts , non-modular PSUs are pretty uniform , so if you ’ve installed one PSU , you ’ve installed them all … sorta .
Do n’t worry though if you are first time builder , just :
Step 1 : Open the bracket from the back of the case .
Step 2 : Place the PSU so that its exhaust is blowing out of the case
Step 3 : Secure the bracket back to its place .
Step 4 : Screw it back in place .
If you ’re using an old case , then you might need to push the case firmly against the inside wall of the case before you lock it in place with the four screws .
The power supply we ’re using as an example ( Corsair CXM 550W 80 + Bronze PSU ) is semi-modular .
This means that some of the cables can be removed to help keep things clean , but some of the other cables , like the one that leads to the motherboard and which will always be needed , can not be removed from the PSU .

3. Processor ( CPU ) Installation
During the next 3 steps , we will be outfitting the motherboard prior to installing it .
Before you even unbox the CPU , be aware that you should never touch the bottom where the pins are ; it ’s always best to hold it by its sides .
Intel and AMD processors largely install the same way , but there are slight differences as covered below .
For Intel :
Step 1 : Slide the spring - loaded retention arm out and up .
Step 2 : Lift the bracket up ( do n’t bother taking off the plastic cover ) .
Step 3 : Gently place the processor on top of the socket by matching the golden triangle located on the bottom - left corner of the Intel processor chip with the triangle on the socket bracket .
You should n’t need to press down on it .
If it does n’t align properly , then pick it up and make sure it ’s placed properly and that none of the pins are damaged .
Step 4 : Slide the bracket back to its original position
Step 5 : Slide the spring - loaded retention arm back down and lock it back in place
Note :
It ’s perfectly alright for the plastic cover to pop off when doing Step 5 , so you should n’t worry about a thing if it flies off .
It ’s also worth noting that the plastic cover at this point has served its purpose .
Personally , I like to keep it somewhere safe so I can use it to protect the pins on the motherboard CPU socket in the future in case I want to remove the CPU for upgrade purposes .
For AMD :
Step 1 : Lift the spring - loaded retention arm out and up .
Step 2 : Gently place the processor on top of the socket by matching the golden triangle located on the bottom - left corner of the AMD processor with the triangle on the socket .
You should n’t need to press down on it .
If it does n’t align properly , then pick it up and make sure it ’s placed properly and that none of the pins are damaged .
Step 3 : Make sure it ’s in place before lowering the retention arm back down and locking it in place .
Once everything is locked in place , it ’s time to install the RAM or memory sticks .

4. Memory ( RAM ) Installation
The RAM are probably the easiest to install .
Step 1 : Push the latches on either end of the RAM slots on the motherboard .
Step 2 : Line up the notch on the bottom of the memory with the notch in the RAM slot .
Step 3 : Gently push both sides of the memory into the slot .
The motherboard we ’re using in this example ( MSI H310M Pro-VD Micro ATX Motherboard ) only has 2 RAM slots .
If the motherboard you have has 4 or 8 slots , refer to your motherboard ’s manual to see which slots to fill first to ensure you are running it in Dual Channel .
Placing the RAM in the wrong slots would mean you ’re not using Dual Channel mode , and thus wasting its capacity .

5. Mounting the CPU Cooler
While some components are highly standardized , CPU coolers come in a lot of different shapes and sizes ; many third - party CPU coolers even require installing a backplate .
As such , you should follow its installation guide .
The overall idea is to affix the backplate that comes with the CPU cooler ( with the four pins ) through the back of your motherboard first so you can mount the cooler in place later after installing the motherboard inside the case ( 5 . Motherboard ( MOBO ) Installation ) .
When you ’re done installing the motherboard with the CPU mount backplate , it ’s time to install the cooler on the CPU .
Keep in mind that most CPU coolers have pre-applied thermal paste .
If yours does n’t , add a small blob of thermal paste , ideally , around the size of a pea , on the center of the CPU .
This will then spread out evenly as you mount the cooler in place .
It ’s also important to note that installing an air CPU cooler is different than installing a liquid CPU cooler .
Air CPU Cooler
Ideally , you want to install an air CPU cooler with the fans unattached , installing the heatsink onto the pins of the mounting plate first before installing the motherboard inside the case .
When done , all you need to do is to simply reattach the fans to the mount and plug in the 4 - pin PWM fan header into the motherboard ’s CPU fan slot , which is usually located at the top side of the motherboard .
There ’s more than one way to find the CPU fan slot :
Read the label on the motherboard .
Refer to your motherboard manual to see where the CPU fan slot is located .
Liquid CPU Cooler
Installing a liquid CPU cooler follows the general process of installing the mounting plate first before attaching the heatsink onto the CPU .
Taking the liquid cooler and the case we used as an example , put the 240 mm liquid CPU cooler at the front of the case as an intake fan and screw it in place using the # 2 Phillips screwdriver along with the included radiator .
This acts as two intake fans at the same time , so using the 2nd included fan as a second exhaust will balance the airflow ( 2 intake fans / 2 exhaust ) .
More of this in the 7 .
Fan Installation section .
Also , you may need to plug in a second 4 - pin cable dedicated to the AIO cooler for the pump or even a Molex connector if you ’re going to use the CPU cooler ( Cooler Master MasterLiquid Lite 240 Liquid Cooler ) on our example for the RGB lighting setup and whatnot .
If you ’re unsure or confused , always refer to your CPU cooler manual .
When done , it ’s time to install the motherboard inside the case .

6. Motherboard ( MOBO ) Installation
Installing the motherboard is kind of tricky .
In fact , you will need to have patience with this step .
The standoff screws and I/O shield can be notoriously annoying .
Both tasks represent a balance act between power and dexterity .
Still , it ’s nothing too complex , just annoying .
Step 1 : Grab the I/O shield and install it by pushing it into the rectangular slot found in the back of the case .
Push on the edges– not in the middle– otherwise , it could break .
You need to do this first , because you ca n’t put it in place once the motherboard is installed .
Step 2 : Check for pre-installed motherboard standoffs and see if it ’s in line with the holes found on your selected motherboard .
Note : Some motherboards , like the Phanteks Eclipse P400s , have pre-installed motherboard standoffs for ATX sized boards while some do n’t .
Make sure you double check .
Step 3 : Lay the case down and carefully lay your motherboard on top of the standoff screws as you line it up with the ports and respective holes in the I/O shield .
Step 4 : Use the # 2 Phillips screwdriver to tighten the screws that came with the case to secure the motherboard in .
Do n’t tighten them too much at a time , though , as you can crack your motherboard .
It ’s very important to refer to your case ’s and your motherboard ’s manual to identify which screw to use– or if you ’re simply confused .

7. Fan Installation
The Phanteks P400S ATX Mid Tower Case comes pre-installed with 2 x 120 mm case fans ( 1 intake and 1 exhaust ) .
But since we included a Cooler Master MasterLiquid Lite 240 mm Liquid Cooler in this example , we want to balance things out for maximum airflow .
Step 1 : Unscrew the included 120 mm intake fan from the front panel using the # 2 Phillips screwdriver .
Step 2 : Move it to the top ( further to the rear side ) as a second exhaust fan and screw it in place .
As mentioned above , you want to equalize the number of intake / exhaust to achieve quality airflow inside the case .
You should remember that not all cases have included fans .
So , if it only comes with 1 fan , then your best bet is to place it at the rear to act as an exhaust .
Just make sure you get another 120 mm fan as an intake later on .

8. Storage ( SSD or HDD ) Installation
Now , it ’s time to install the hard disk drives ( HDD ) and the solid - state drives ( SSD ) – or even the M.2 SSD if you decided to use this instead .
If we go back to 1 .
Breaking the Case , you should already have an idea where the drives should go in your case .
And if we use the case from our example ( Phanteks P400S ATX Mid Tower Case ) , we can put the Hitachi Ultrastar 7K3000 2TB HDD inside the hard drive bay found at the back of the case ( not the rear ) .
We can also put the ADATA Ultimate SU800 512GB SSD on this side by screwing it in its respective place .
If you have an M.2 SSD , refer to your motherboard manual to see where it should go .
These things go directly into your motherboard and is not designed to be placed in any drive bays .
As always , refer to your case manual if you ’re confused or unsure where to store your storage devices .
And remember that there are computer cases that may restrict access to specific hard drive bays if you use a radiator - type cooling system as an intake .
As such , make sure you do your research prior to making any selection .

9. Graphic Card ( GPU ) Installation
After installing the storage devices , it ’s time to install the graphics card– the heart of every gaming PC .
When you first take it out from the anti-static bag , place it on a safe , non-metal surface and make sure you do the following :
Step 1 : Locate the PCIe slot on your motherboard that is closest to your CPU .
Step 2 : Remove the 2x PCIe slot covers with the help of the # 2 Phillips screwdriver .
Step 3 : Take the graphics card and line it up with the PCIe slot closest to your CPU .
The GPU I/O ports should face out the back of the computer case .
Step 4 : Gently push the graphics card into the PCIe slot until you hear a click sound , indicating it ’s locked in place .
Step 5 : Screw the PCIe slot cover you just unscrewed to secure the rear end of the graphics card .
Do n’t forget to always check the dimensions of the graphics card before purchasing so you can evaluate and see whether or not it ’ll fit just right inside the case .
In particular , some of the high - end GPUs have large , dedicated coolers that can make it hard to squeeze into cases , even the standard ATX Full - tower cases .

10 . Hooking up the Buttons and I / O Ports
Along your motherboard , you will have a lot of different pins and ports and what have you .
You will need to use these to hook up your power , reset , and other I/O buttons and ports .
Honestly , this can be one of the most challenging tasks when building a computer .
You have a lot of small cords with sometimes very similar connectors all going to different places .
In fact , I still have problems with this from time to time .
To make sure you ’re plugging the right cables to the right ports , refer to your motherboard installation manual .
Some cases come with LED lights ( like the Phanteks P400S ATX Mid Tower Case ) , and they have to be oriented correctly with the + and – pins on the board .
11 . Connecting The Cables
Now that everything ’s in place , it ’s time to hook the cables to the motherboard ports .
You probably have a general idea which cables go to which ports by now if you followed the very first step .
So do that if you have n’t already or proceed and check which holes the cables should be routed to .
Step 1 : Connect the 8 - pin EPS from the PSU through the cable routing hole to the EPS connector on the motherboard , usually located at the top portion of the motherboard
Step 2 : Get the 24 - pin cable from the PSU and slide it through the cable management hole to get to the 24 - pin ATX port of the motherboard , usually located at the right side of the motherboard
Step 3 : Take the SATA power cable and SATA data cables and connect it to the hard disk drives .
If needed , route the cables through the cable management holes to get to the SSD storage device .
The SATA data pins are located at the lower right portion of the motherboard just below the 24 - pin port .
Step 4 : Connect the PCIe 6 - pin connector from the PSU to the graphics card through the cable management holes
For now , the cables do n’t have to be orderly .
First , we need to test that the machine is actually running as intended .
12 . Testing it Out and Cleaning up the Mess
At this point , you will need to bring some of your peripherals into the picture , like monitor , keyboard , and mouse .
Connect the power supply to an electrical outlet or an automatic voltage regulator ( AVR ) and turn the computer on .
( Do n’t forget to turn the switch behind the power supply on !
It ’s very common for builders– including me !– to forget about this . )
If it turns on , hit the delete key until the BIOS screen pops up .
Try to check the CPU temperatures and make sure it operates somewhere around 30 - 40 degrees Celsius ( 86 – 104 degrees Fahrenheit ) .
Similarly , check if the drives are registered and whether or not your memory is operating at the right frequencies .
If you get to this part of the building process , you ’re good to go .
But if you did n’t get any of this , check everything from the start and make sure you did n’t miss a thing .
Now that you ’re sure you have a working computer , you can now tidy up the cables at the back and use the Velcro straps and zip ties to secure everything in place .
13 . OS Installation
Now that your computer is working , you can bring it to where it ’ll spend the rest of its life and hook up all of your peripherals for good this time .
Now , we ’ll install the operating system .
Modern PC setups do n’t have optical drives so you ’ll need to download the OS onto a flash drive from another computer .
To do this , download the Windows 10 installer from this link .
Keep in mind you will need a product key if you wish to install a paid version of Windows .
And in case you ca n’t afford Windows 10 right now , you can install a Linux distribution ( Ubuntu or Mint ) .
This obviously lacks many common Windows features and most software native to Windows , so most software , including games , so you will likely want to get Windows 10 eventually .
When you ’re done , make sure the computer is turned off and follow the steps below :
Step 1 : Plug the flash drive that has the OS installed in your computer .
Step 2 : Turn the computer on and constantly hit the delete ( Del ) key to enter BIOS .
Step 3 : Browse around and find the Boot page ( sometimes called Boot Order or Boot Priority ) .
Step 4 : Change the boot order by prioritizing the flash drive that contains the OS .
Step 5 : Save the changes and restart your computer .
Step 6 : Follow the instructions indicated to complete the OS installation .
Remember , this will take a little while .
NOTE : It ’ll take some time to complete the installation process but once installed , you ’re one step closer to finally completing the build .
14 . Installing the Drivers
After you ’ve completed installing the OS , download the right chipset driver for your motherboard and graphics card .
To do this …
Step 1.1 : Head over to the motherboard manufacturer ’s website and download the respective motherboard drivers .
Here are some of the more popular motherboard manufacturer websites :
Step 1.2 : As for GPUs , it is a little more straightforward since there are really only two viable competitors .
Click this link to download NVIDIA graphics card drivers or this link to download AMD graphics card drivers .
Step 2 : Open the setup file and follow the on -screen installation instructions .
NOTE : Your screen may flicker when installing the graphics card drivers so do n’t panic when it does so .
Step 3 : Restart your computer after installation ( or it may automatically do it for you ) and you ’re done !
At this point , you ’re basically done so CONGRATULATIONS !
That was n’t so hard after all , right ?
From here , you ’ll want to install the programs you need .
For instance , if you ’re a gamer , online gaming platforms such as Steam or EPIC Games are probably at the top of your list .

Afghan oil paintings world 's oldest
Artists in Afghanistan were painting using oils as far back as the 7th century , research shows , hundreds of years before oil paint was used in Europe .
The world 's first oil paintings were in caves near two destroyed giant statues of Buddha at Bamiyan .
Samples from paintings , dating from the 7th century , were taken from caves behind two statues of Buddha that were blown up as un-Islamic by Afghanistan 's hardline Taliban in 2001 .
The paintings in 12 of the 50 caves were created using oil paints , possibly from walnut or poppy , according to scientists at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility ( ESRF ) in France .
The murals show scenes of Buddhas in vermilion robes sitting cross-legged amid palm leaves and mythical creatures .
" This is the earliest clear example of oil paintings in the world , although drying oils were already used by ancient Romans and Egyptians , but only as medicines and cosmetics , " says team leader Yoko Taniguchi .
Synchrotron analysis of the paint layers reveals layers of natural resins , proteins , gums and in some cases a resinous , varnish - like layer , as well as the oil paint .
The researchers publish their findings in the Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry .
It was not until the 13th century that oil was added to paints in Europe and oil paint was not widely used in Europe till the early 15th century .
Bamiyan was once a thriving Buddhist centre where monks lived in a series of caves carved into the cliffs by the two statues .
The cave paintings were probably the work of artists travelling along the Silk Road , the ancient trade route between China , across Central Asia to the West , the ESRF says .
Afghanistan 's Taliban government used dozens of explosive charges to bring down the two 6th century giant Buddhas in March 2001 , saying the statues were un -Islamic .
Now work is under way to try to restore the biggest of the two statues , once the tallest standing Buddha in the world .
But the mammoth task could take a decade to complete .
The big money Clinton backers , pissy that their candidate is doing poorly and stands no chance at winning unless the super - delegates overrule the voters , are putting the screws to Pelosi :
Twenty top
Hillary fundraisers and donors have sent a scathing private letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , chastising her for publicly saying that the super - delegates should support the winner of the pledged delegate count and demanding that she say that they should make an “ independent ” choice .
Greg Sargent has the whole letter .
As someone new to the party , I have to say the awesomeness of the Democratic circular firing squad really can not be explained to outsiders .
You can try to explain it , but it just does n’t sink in until you are actually a part of it .
The Bush administration and Republican rule has been an unmitigated disaster for this country , and the Clinton camp seems dead set on making sure we get four more years of it .
Bush ’s poll number are worse than syphillis , and yet the Clinton campaign and their supporters keep making me yearn for the decency and the integrity of the say - anything Romney crowd .
This primary has truly been full of win for me , and a real eye - opener .
While the GOP is turning lemons into lemonade with McCain , the Democrats are showing the world they know how to turn filet mignon into a shit sandwich .
Impressive work .
I think I am going to start drinking again .
Appalling
The conduct of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal is absolutely appalling .
I attended part of the March 25th Warman versus Lemire hearing and would have used a transcript to verify what I wrote about it and to further investigate things I was n't able to cover at the time .
Yet at the end of the hearing they claimed that as a " cost saving " measure no transcript would be produced .
That hearing , being the one that focussed on the processes and investigative methods of the CHRC itself was the only one to date to have no transcript released .
Ezra Levant elaborates on the full , sordid story .
And produces the transcript they did n't want released .
The closer you look at these kangaroo courts the more appalling they are .

' Problematic Mixing of Politics and Religion ' German Politician Compares Dalai Lama to Ayatollah Khomeini
A German Left Party politician has caused controversy with a speech in which she indirectly compared the Dalai Lama to Iran 's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini .
She also claims the Dalai Lama represents the " deification of political power . "
The US last week released its 2007 wiretapping stats , and they show that such surveillance is up a full 20 percent over the year before .
The number of non-secret wiretaps is higher than it has ever been in the last decade , and not a single application was denied in all of 2007 .
If you 're concerned about privacy , though , the report makes clear that you 're statistically unlikely to be targeted unless you use a cell phone to run drugs .
Murder might also earn you a wiretap , but apart from that , the authorities do n't seem to use wiretaps in all but unusual cases .
2,208 wiretaps were requested last year , up from 1,839 the year before , and the vast majority of them were run by state authorities ; only 457 wiretaps were executed by the feds .
No applications for wiretap were denied , but this is hardly uncommon .
Since 1997 , some 15,000 wiretaps have been made , but only four applications were rejected in that entire time .
When we look at the prevalence of wiretaps , two trends stand out .
One is that taps are almost exclusively used on " portable devices , " including digital pagers and portable phones .
In fact , 94 percent of all taps authorized last year were for such devices .
The second trend is that most wiretaps are used in narcotics cases .
81 percent of all taps were for drug - related crime , with murder and assault coming in a distant second ( 6 percent ) .
Wiretaps apparently have something in common with shopping at bulk retailers ; when you buy more items at once , the price goes down .
The cost per intercept has been dropping since 2003 , when it peaked at $ 62,164 .
In 2007 , that number had fallen to $ 48,477 per investigation .
While that still sounds pricey , the report notes that drug intercepts have often been used to make big busts .
One set of 2007 wiretaps in Morris County , New Jersey led to the arrest of 105 people ; another , in New York , scooped up 51 people , 48 of whom were later convicted .
Another 57 - day wiretap in California led to the seizure of 40 pounds of methamphetamine , four kilograms of cocaine , and $ 700,000 in cash .
Of course , those are just regular warrants .
The Justice Department also released information this week on secret warrants issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court .
These numbers are also rising , and have been going up since 2001 ; the increase is a dramatic one .
In 2001 , the Court approved only 1,012 applications , but approved 2,370 last year .
The ACLU said in a statement that " the ever - increasing reach of government surveillance should be disturbing to anyone committed to constitutional values .
Pervasive surveillance , besides eroding the right to privacy , deters innocent people from participating in the political process and from exercising their freedoms of speech , association , and religion .
It has a chilling effect on activity that is absolutely necessary to any democracy . "
And neither of these wiretapping numbers have anything to do with the warrantless surveillance being conducted on phone and Internet traffic by the National Security Administration .
So take back all that I said above about surveillance only being used on drug dealers with cell phones .
The truth is that we simply do n't know how much total government surveillance is being done , who is being looked at , and what sort of information is being examined .
If Congress ends up granting the telecom companies that participated in the program the immunity they crave , we may never know .

San Francisco - The Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) and the law firm of Sheppard Mullin Richter & Hampton Thursday filed a motion to dismiss a lawsuit brought against the operator of the popular online encyclopedia Wikipedia , arguing that federal law immunizes it against suits over statements made by its users .
Literary agent Barbara Bauer filed a complaint in New Jersey Superior Court in January against Wikipedia posters as well as the site itself , claiming in part that the Wikimedia Foundation was liable for statements identifying her as one the " dumbest of the twenty worst " agents and that she had " no documented sales at all . "
In court papers filed Thursday , Wikimedia argues that under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act , operators of " interactive computer services " such as Wikipedia cannot be held liable for users ' comments .
In addition , Wikimedia argues that the statements are protected speech under the First Amendment and New Jersey law .
The ability to utilize the collaborative input of its users without fear of costly lawsuits is essential to Wikipedia 's ongoing success , said Wikimedia Foundation General Counsel Mike Godwin .
" We provide a platform through Wikipedia for smart citizens to give their knowledge back to a larger culture , " Godwin said .
" Our ability to offer citizens that platform is what 's at stake in this case . "
Since it was signed into law over a decade ago , courts across the country have consistently applied the protections of Section 230 broadly , fulfilling Congress ' intent " to preserve the vibrant and competitive free market that presently exists for the Internet and other interactive computer services , unfettered by Federal or State regulation . "
" Congress passed Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in order to protect websites ' operators like Wikipedia from suits like this one , " said James Chadwick of Sheppard Mullin .
" It 's simple but it 's fundamental : Congress has decided that Internet censorship is n't the answer , so websites are n't liable for statements posted by their users . "
Section 230's blanket protection of sites like Wikipedia does not mean that alleged defamation on the Internet cannot be challenged in court .
Instead , the law requires that litigants direct their efforts at the speakers themselves and not the forums where statements were made .
" Wikipedia continues to be a tremendous resource for people around the globe , " added EFF Senior Staff Attorney Matt Zimmerman .
" Without strong liability protection , it would be difficult for Wikipedia to continue to provide a platform for user - created encyclopedia content . "

Remember the Ford dealership that ran a radio ad telling non-Christians to " sit down and shut up ? "
" JW Horne , " who claims he works for the dealership writing the ads posted to his blog , defending his decision , telling " non-believers " and " plain doubters " that we are " in the minority and as loud as you yell and protest , you will always be in the minority . "
But today , Rick Kieffe , owner of Kieffe and Sons Ford in Mojave and Rosamond , publicly apologized for the ad , saying that a ) he does n't actually attend church , and b ) he did n't approve the ad .
" It 's just something that went by us , " said Kieffe , who does not attend church but considers himself " a Christian spirit . "
" We 're obviously sorry that it offends a given segment who identifies themselves as atheist . "

Unfortunately in the past we ’ve had trouble cashing those checks .
It ’s nothing against you personally , but based on past problems we ca n’t accept temporary checks . ”

WASHINGTON ( AP ) — The U.S. Chamber of Commerce parted ways Tuesday with its longtime political strategist , as the organization , once a Republican stalwart , has demonstrated a more bipartisan spending streak in the Donald Trump era .
Scott Reed said he left after “ constant disagreements ” about the business lobbying organization ’s commitment to helping Republicans maintain control of the Senate , “ with money being spent in a silly manner . ”
He added that senior executives “ spent way too much time bashing Trump and the ( White House ) all summer long . ”
A Chamber spokesperson disputed Reed 's account , saying that he was terminated and that an internal review showed he “ repeatedly breached confidentiality , distorted facts for his own benefit , withheld information from Chamber leadership and leaked internal information to the press . "
The Chamber denied that political differences were at the heart of the split , saying it was “ not based on a disagreement over political strategy but rather it is the result of Reed ’s actions . ”
Although its endorsements skew decidedly toward the GOP , the Chamber has still come under fire from Republicans after deciding to endorse 30 Democrats for reelection this cycle .
The Chamber has had an uneasy relationship with Trump , supporting policies like his 2017 tax reform package but breaking with him publicly on immigration and trade policies .
In a statement , the spokesperson said , “ We now return to the important work of ensuring that the Senate continues to advance pro-business priorities , supporting the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett , and helping the nation ’s economy recovery . ”
It added that the organization will announce a new wave of political spending Wednesday .

Veterans For Peace will deliver a petition supporting the impeachment of President Bush to Rep. John Conyers on Wed. , June 11 , and intends to conduct a sit - in in his office until he agrees to meet with them .
" By invading and occupying Iraq , the Bush administration every day violates legally binding international treaties and domestic laws , " VFP Executive Director Michael McPhearson said in a written statement .
" Congressman Conyers and his colleagues must hold them accountable and our Constitution prescribes how : impeachment .
It 's not enough to simply watch the Bush administration retire .
Unless we hold them accountable we and Congress are complicit in their war crimes and put U.S. soldiers at risk of retaliation . "
VFP collected 22,000 names on a petition supporting the impeachment of Bush .
Members said they tried for two months to get a 10 - minute meeting with Conyers , who chairs the House Judiciary Committee .
( Image by Unknown Owner ) Details DMCA
VFP members from New York , North Carolina , New Jersey , Ohio and the District of Columbia will take part in the sit-in .
VFP President Elliott Adams cited numerous impeachable offenses committed by the Bush administration including : violating domestic laws ; binding international treaties and the U.S. Constitution by condoning torture in Iraq ; and violating the Geneva Conventions , U.N. Charter and resolutions , the Nuremberg Principles and the Laws and Customs of War on Land .
Adams , a former Army paratrooper and Viet Nam combat vet , provided Conyers a copy of the VFP " Case for Impeachment " that documents claims of war crimes , crimes against humanity and crimes against peace committed or encouraged by the Bush administration .
He also included a video CD of testimonies selected from the Iraq Veterans Against the War's " Winter Soldier " hearings held in March .

Adams asked Conyers to " not sit on the sidelines or be a keeper of the status quo like those who stood in your way when you demanded action for what is right .
The time for justice is always now . ”
Showcasing cool pictures of rare clouds caught on camera around the World .
Clouds fill the skies above us and are part of our every day lives but often go unnoticed .
However , there are some clouds that are so rare that you will be very lucky to see them in your lifetime .
This is a list of the top 10 most rarest cloud formations ( in no particular order ) that for those lucky enough to see them , were caught on camera .
1. Nacreous Clouds
These rare clouds , sometimes called mother - of - pearl clouds , are 15 – 25 km ( 9 - 16 miles ) high in the stratosphere and well above tropospheric clouds .
They have iridescent colours but are higher and much rarer than ordinary iridescent clouds .
They are seen mostly but not exclusively in polar regions and in winter at high latitudes , Scandinavia , Alaska , Northern Canada .
Lower level iridescent clouds can be seen anywhere .
Nacreous clouds shine brightly in high altitude sunlight up to two hours after ground level sunset or before dawn .
Their unbelievably bright iridescent colours and slow movement relative to any lower clouds make them an unmistakable and unforgettable sight .
2. Mammatus Clouds
Mammatus Clouds are pouch - like cloud structures and a rare example of clouds in sinking air .
Sometimes very ominous in appearance , mammatus clouds are harmless and do not mean that a tornado is about to form – a commonly held misconception .
In fact , mammatus are usually seen after the worst of a thunderstorm has passed .
3. Altocumulus Castelanus
Also known as jellyfish clouds due to their jellyfish - like appearance .
These formed around 17,000 ft due to when the rush of moist air comes from the Gulf Stream and gets trapped between layers of dry air .
The top of the cloud rises into a jellyfish shape and long tentacles known as “ trailing virga ” form from rain drops that have evaporated .
4. Noctilucent Clouds
Noctilucent Clouds or Polar Mesopheric Clouds :
This is supremely rare cloud formation that occurs out on the verge of space between 82 km to 102 km from the earth ’s surface .
Noctilucent clouds appear to be luminous yet they reflect the sunlight from the other side of the earth at night , giving them a glowing appearance .
5. Mushroom Clouds
A mushroom cloud is a distinctive mushroom - shaped cloud of smoke , condensed water vapour , or debris resulting from a very large explosion .
They are most commonly associated with nuclear explosions , but any sufficiently large blast will produce the same sort of effect .
Volcano eruptions and impact events can produce natural mushroom clouds .
Mushroom clouds as a result of the sudden formation of a large mass of hot low - density gases near the ground creating a Rayleigh - Taylor instability .
The mass of gas rises rapidly , resulting in turbulent vortices curling downward around its edges and drawing up a column of additional smoke and debris in the centre to form its “ stem ” .
The mass of gas eventually reaches an altitude where it is no longer less dense than the surrounding air and disperses , the debris drawn upward from the ground scattering and drifting back down .
6. Cirrus Kelvin- Helmholtz
Appearing as a slender , horizontal spiral of cloud , cirrus Kelvin - Helmholtz is one of the most distinctive cloud formations .
However , it tends to dissipate only a minute or two after forming and , as a result , is rarely observed .
Average height is around 16,500 ft .
7. Lenticular Clouds
Lenticular Clouds , technically known as altocumulus standing lenticularis , are stationary lens - shaped clouds that form at high altitudes , normally aligned at right - angles to the wind direction .
Where stable moist air flows over a mountain or a range of mountains , a series of large - scale standing waves may form on the downwind side .
Lenticular clouds sometimes form at the crests of these waves .
Under certain conditions , long strings of lenticular clouds can form , creating a formation known as a wave cloud .
Lenticular clouds are popular with UFO believers because they often look like flying saucers .
The lens - shaped clouds form at high altitude and are usually formed when moist air passes over a mountain range and is heated adiabatically ( that is , without any transference of heat energy ) as it descends .
The cloud pattern depends upon the wind speed and the shape of the mountains .
A constant wind may produce clouds which are stable and remain virtually stationary in the sky for long periods .
These clouds can often be mistaken for UFOs !

Here is another very spooky cloud caught on video :
8. Roll Clouds and Morning Glory Clouds
A roll cloud is a low , horizontal tube - shaped arcus cloud associated with a thunderstorm gust front , or sometimes a cold front .
Roll clouds can also be a sign of possible microburst activity .
Cool air sinking air from a storm cloud ’s downdraft spreads out across the surface with the leading edge called a gust front .
This outflow undercuts warm air being drawn into the storm ’s updraft .
As the cool air lifts the warm moist air water condenses creating cloud , which often rolls with the different winds above and below ( wind shear ) .
Roll clouds are basically shelf clouds without attachment to a thunderstorm .
Here is a video of a Roll Cloud in action
Morning Glory cloud is a rare meteorological phenomenon occasionally observed in different locations around the world .
The southern part of Northern Australia ’s Gulf of Carpentaria is the only known location where it can be predicted and observed on a more or less regular basis due to the configuration of land and sea in the area .
The settlement of Burketown attracts glider pilots intent on riding this phenomenon .
9. Shelf Clouds
A shelf cloud is a low , horizontal wedge - shaped arcus cloud , associated with a thunderstorm gust front ( or occasionally with a cold front , even in the absence of thunderstorms ) .
Unlike a roll cloud , a shelf cloud is attached to the base of the parent cloud above it ( usually a thunderstorm ) .
Rising cloud motion often can be seen in the leading ( outer ) part of the shelf cloud , while the underside often appears turbulent , boiling , and wind - torn .
10 . Undulatus Asperatus Clouds

Women who commit sexual offences are just as likely to have mental problems or drug addictions as other violent female criminals .
This according to the largest study ever conducted of women convicted of sexual offences in Sweden .
Between 1988 and 2000 , 93 women and 8,500 men were convicted of sexual offences in Sweden .
Given that previous research has focused on male perpetrators , knowledge of the factors specific to female sex offenders has been scant .
A group of researchers at the Swedish medical university Karolinska Institutet have now looked into incidences of mental illness and drug abuse in these 93 convicted women , and compared them with over 20,000 randomly selected women in the normal population and with the 13,000 - plus women who were convicted of non-sexual crimes over the same period .
Thirty - seven per cent of the women convicted of sex offences had undergone treatment at a psychiatric clinic during the period , and eight per cent had been diagnosed as having a psychosis .
There was no difference in incidences of mental illness and drug abuse between these women and women who had committed other kinds of violent crime .
" This is interesting as men who commit sexual offences usually have fewer psychiatric problems than men who commit other violent crimes , " says Niklas Långström , Associate Professor at Karolinska Institutet 's Centre for Violence Prevention and one of the authors of the study .
" So it seems as if female sex offenders , more so than male , suffer from mental illness or have drug problems . "
However , the figures differ widely from the control group .
Incidences of psychosis were 16 times higher amongst the sex offenders than the control group , drug abuse 23 times higher .
According to the research team , the results indicate that women suspected or convicted of sexual offences should undergo routine psychiatric examination , something which , at present , is not done .
By sexual offence in this study is meant rape , non-consensual sex , sexual abuse and sexual molestation .
The group has earlier published a similar study on male sexual offenders .

Those who peer at children in public could find themselves on the wrong side of the law in Maine soon .
A bill that passed the House last month aims to strengthen the crime of visual sexual aggression against children , according to state Rep.
Dawn Hill , D - York .
Her involvement started when Ogunquit Police Lt. David Alexander was called to a local beach to deal with a man who appeared to be observing children entering the community bathrooms .
Because the state statute prevents arrests for visual sexual aggression of a child in a public place , Alexander said he and his fellow officer could only ask the man to move along .
" There was no violation of law that we could enforce .
There was nothing we could charge him with , " Alexander said .
He attended a talk with Hill a week later and brought the case to her attention .
Hill pledged to do what she could , Alexander said , and the result was a change through the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee in the House , which made the law applicable in both private and public places .
Alexander said he 's grateful Hill was willing to take up the cause , and is hopeful the measure will clear the Senate .
" I 'll be pleased that we were able to identify this flaw and take steps to rectify it , " he said .
Under the bill , if someone is arrested for viewing children in a public place , it would be a Class D felony if the child is between 12 to 14 years old and a Class C felony if the child is under 12 , according to Alexander .
Hill said she believes the move was necessary to correct what she called a " loophole " in the state 's criminal law statutes .
" I told Lt. Alexander that I would be happy to work with him and sponsor a bill that would correct this in the 2008 session , " Hill said .
" And so we did . "
In arguing for the bill , Alexander said she cited public rest rooms as places where the people using them should have a reasonable expectation of privacy .
She said the committee determined that there would not be any major side effects from expanding the statute to include public places .
The bill recently cleared a fiscal review , done because of the state 's major prison budget crunch , and Hill said it should be heading to the Senate before long .
York Police Chief Doug Bracy said the statute would represent a fairly minor change that would help keep the public safer , especially children .
He noted that York police respond fairly regularly to reports of public peepers on the town 's beaches .
With ever - growing concern over sexual predators , Bracy said the arrests will also allow police to check backgrounds and determine if there is a criminal history involved .
" There is a growing outcry by the public to protect our children , " Bracy said , noting that tourists from all over the country visit York .
James Dobson , the Focus on the Family founder and a leader of the Religious Right , was attacking Barack Obama recently because he says Obama was “ deliberately distorting the Bible ” and has a “ fruitcake interpretation of the Constitution . ”
Dobson was referencing a speech Obama made two years ago .
( He ’s a fast one , that Dobson . )
Why did he do it ?
Perhaps because he knows his leverage among Christians is waning and he was trying to make a power move .
Do n’t believe his support is dwindling ?
A group of pastors headed by ( friend of George W. Bush ) Kirbyjon Caldwell began a website called jamesdobsondoesntspeakforme.com .
Their core statement reads :
James Dobson does n’t speak for me .
He does n’t speak for me when he uses religion as a wedge to divide ;
He does n’t speak for me when he speaks as the final arbiter on the meaning of the Bible ; James Dobson does n’t speak for me when he uses the beliefs of others as a line of attack ;
He does n’t speak for me when he denigrates his neighbor ’s views when they do n’t line up with his ;
He does n’t speak for me when he seeks to confine the values of my faith to two or three issues alone ;
What does speak for me is David ’s psalm celebrating how good and pleasant it is when we come together in unity ; Micah speaks for me in reminding us that the Lord requires us to act justly , to love mercy and to walk humbly with Him ;
The prophet Isaiah speaks for me in his call for all to come and reason together and also to seek justice , encourage the oppressed and to defend the cause of the vulnerable ;
The book of Nehemiah speaks for me in its example to work with our neighbors , not against them , to restore what was broken in our communities ;
The book of Matthew speaks for me in saying to bless those that curse you and pray for those who persecute you ;
The words of the apostle Paul speak for me in saying that words spoken and deeds done without love amount to nothing .
The apostle John speaks for me in reminding us of Jesus ’ command to love one another .
The world will know His disciples by that love .
These words speak for me .
But when James Dobson attacks Barack Obama , James Dobson does n’t speak for me .
If you ’re a Christian who agrees with the statement , you ’re welcome to sign a statement on the site saying so .
Those pastors support Obama in their individual capacities , by the way , not on behalf of their churches .
Jim Wallis , founder and president of Sojourners ( a “ progressive Christian commentary ” ) , also has issues with what Dobson said about Obama .
In fact , Obama ’s comments were made at an event sponsored by Wallis ’ group .
He writes about Dobson ’s remarks :
… In most every case they are themselves clear distortions of what Obama said in that speech .
I was there for the speech ; Dobson was not . … …
The United States is not the Christian theocracy that people like James Dobson seem to think it should be .
Political appeals , even if rooted in religious convictions , must be argued on moral grounds rather than as sectarian religious demands — so that the people ( citizens ) , whether religious or not , may have the capacity to hear and respond .
Religious convictions must be translated into moral arguments , which must win the political debate if they are to be implemented .
Religious people do n’t get to win just because they are religious .
They , like any other citizens , have to convince their fellow citizens that what they propose is best for the common good — for all of us , not just for the religious .
Nice to hear members of the Religious Left turning on the Religious Right .
It ’s about time .
I ’m looking forward to the day when religion wo n’t play such an important role in elections but , right now , that ’s unrealistic .
In the meantime , we need to support those Christian leaders who are not using their faith as a weapon to influence political leaders and who want to see an end to their faith being distorted by the likes of Dobson .

Dr. Ahmed Shafik wears three - piece suits with gold watch fobs and a diamond stickpin in the lapel .
His glasses are the thick , black rectangular style of the Nasser era .
He owns a Cairo hospital and lives in a mansion with marble walls .
He was nominated for a Nobel Prize . *
I do n’t care about any of this .
Shafik won my heart by publishing a paper in European Urology in which he investigated the effects of polyester on sexual activity .
Ahmed Shafik dressed lab rats in polyester pants .
There were 75 rats .
They wore their pants for one year .
Shafik found that over time the ones dressed in polyester or poly - cotton blend had sex significantly less often than the rats whose slacks were cotton or wool .
( Shafik thinks the reason is that polyester sets up troublesome electrostatic fields in and around the genitals .
Having seen an illustration of a rat wearing the pants , I would say there ’s an equal possibility that it ’s simply harder to get a date when you dress funny . )
* Nominations for a Nobel Prize , I found out when I contacted the Nobel Foundation to try to verify Shafik ’s , remain secret for 50 years .
You make the claim , and nobody can prove otherwise until after you ’re dead .
Add one to your resume today !

Last month the Associated Press cast a harsh light on a dark secret of many big public industries –that workers have far too much access to personal data of customers , and misuse and abuse it accordingly
Vast computer databases give curious employees the ability to look up sensitive information on people with the click of a mouse .
The WE Energies database includes credit and banking information , payment histories , Social Security numbers , addresses , phone numbers , and energy usage .
In some cases , it even includes income and medical information .
Experts say some companies do little to stop such abuses even though they could lead to identity theft , stalking and other privacy invasions .
And companies that uncover violations can keep them quiet because in many cases it is not illegal to snoop , only to use the data for crimes .
This ties in with findings from a new report by Chris Hoofnagle , formerly with the Electronic Privacy Information Center ( EPIC ) and senior fellow for the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology .
Hoofnagle analyzed data compiled from the FTC ’s consumer fraud complaint list and found that the world ’s biggest banks and telecom companies are the largest trouble spots for cases of identity theft and fraud :
The report , compiled from 88,000 complaints filed with the FTC over three months in 2006 , shows that major banks and telecommunications companies accounted for a much larger portion of the filed complaints than other industries , and that telecommunications companies lacked a standard of measuring the complaints .
There ’s a deeply sad irony in the fact that telecom companies who have done all they could to enable the Bush regime ’s illegal surveillance agenda on Americans and are fighting with each other over who ’ll get to police the Internet are also the least capable of actually protecting the data they collect with such feverish intensity .
But this is a common truth typical of all of these surveillance and data mining programs–putting all of these vast troves of data together in one place only makes it all the easier for unscrupulous employees or smart thieves to abuse it .
No security system can ever perfectly account for the unpredictability and capriciousness of human experience–witness this awesome Washington City Paper story about a young petty thief who was able to fool workers at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission into thinking she worked there , using her access to make off with goods and cash .
Social engineering and psychological foibles trump data security every time .
And we , as consumers and citizens , are still kept in the dark over how our data is being sold , resold , used , and misused .
When Lexis - Nexis ’ corporate parent Reed Elsevier announced last month that it would buy infamous data broker ChoicePoint , were privacy advocates given a chance to scrutinize the deal ?
Will it be given any more oversight than a rubber stamp of approval from the FTC or the Department of Justice ?
And more importantly , what will this new information broker juggernaut do with the data it collects , besides sell it to the highest bidder ?
Will it train its employees in ethical conduct and ensure that they only have access to the data they need at any given time ?
These are questions that need answering , if we ’re to prevent more cases of these data treasure troves being pilfered and plundered for profit .
Now , officials have begun to play down the scandal , saying there is little evidence of widespread violations of child labor laws .
A two - day government sweep involving more than 3,000 factories around Dongguan , which was conducted after the initial raids , turned up only 6 to 10 children , officials said .
But residents of Liangshan say abject poverty , drug abuse and a lack of jobs have forced many children to head for factories .
Sometimes it is with their parents ’ permission .
Other times , children disappear , on their own or with job recruiters , and then call home from a factory dormitory , hundreds of miles away .
“ When our daughter left , we were quite worried , ” said 42 - year - old Qi Ji Gu Xi , whose 14 - year - old daughter left last February .
“ We did n’t know where to find her .
Then she called us and told us she ’s a migrant worker in Guangdong . ”
Such stories are not unusual .
In more than two dozen interviews this week , children who had returned home from factories told of hardship and abuse .
Parents living in squalor acknowledged that their children had been lured into traveling to factories .
And other residents said conditions in these mountain villages were so appallingly poor that young people felt they had no choice but to leave home .
On Wednesday , more than 10 families interviewed in the span of five hours in Zhaojue County , part of Liangshan , said they had children working in factories , often earning less than $ 90 a month for 12 - hour days , seven days a week .
Even if the children were of working age , the pay , equivalent to about 25 cents an hour , and the working conditions would violate China ’s labor laws .
In the prime manufacturing zones , the official minimum wage is at least 65 cents an hour , and employers are required to pay significantly more for overtime .
Ji Ke Ri Sha said he had spent more than a year working in factories in several provinces , including Shandong and Shanxi .
His family could not survive on farming alone , he said , and so he took a chance on the world outside .
He hopped from factory to factory , holding four jobs before his 15th birthday .
Cleared to start Mass production
The latest update I have from the factory indicates that mass Production ( that means running the SMT line without stopping to check stuff every two seconds ) has been CLEARED TO START .

BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) - Around 100 anti-war protesters were arrested trying to force their way into NATO ’s headquarters in Belgium on Saturday , police said .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Police in riot gear and on horses clashed with over 500 activists from across Europe -- opposed to military action in Iraq and Afghanistan and the use of nuclear weapons -- outside NATO ’s Brussels hub .
Water cannons were used to prevent most of the protesters from gaining entry to the large security compound situated on the outskirts of the Belgian capital and close to Brussels national airport .
At least one protester was taken to hospital with serious injuries after falling on barbed wire , a police spokeswoman said .
“ We have arrested over 100 and they are being taken to court to be dealt with swiftly . ”
A NATO official said the compound had not been breached .
“ Demonstrations are a feature of democracy .
All we hope for with any such protest is that it is done in a peaceful and safe manner , ” the official told Reuters .
NATO is a security and defense alliance of 26 countries from North America and Europe with forces in Iraq , Afghanistan , Kosovo and Darfur .
Organizers of Saturday ’s “ NATO Game Over ” protest say without the military organization , the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan would not be possible .
They also oppose the use of nuclear weapons .
“ Today is close to the fifth anniversary of the war in Iraq and we are protesting against NATO ’s involvement and in particular European countries which are allowing themselves to be used as military hubs , ” anti-war campaigner Hans Lammerant told Reuters .
“ NATO has 350 U.S. nuclear weapons deployed in Germany , Italy , Belgium , the Netherlands , Britain and Turkey .
According to international humanitarian law these weapons are illegal . ”
Bob Dylan faces the ire of ecologists , unions and local residents because of a concert he is due to perform tonight in a park in the Spanish countryside .
Ten thousand fans are expected to descend on the park for the concert , which is being promoted by local authorities in Castilla y León under the title Musicians in Nature - a reference to its backdrop of lush woods and mountains .
But critics claim that the concert - goers could damage the parkland surrounding Mesegosillo de Hoyos del Espino , an estate in the Sierra de Gredos , a mountainous park near Avila to the west of Madrid .
Carlos Bravo , of the ecology association Centaurea , said : " They have taken no measures to preserve the area despite the large infrastructure that they are building . "
He described putting on concerts of this type as an " atrocity " .
" What [ the government ] is doing is supporting projects which put in clear danger the natural heritage and culture of this community . "
Other organisations protesting against the concert include a local branch of a major union , residents ' groups and Ecologists in Action .
Dylan is performing with the Spanish group Amaral as part of the Spanish leg of his European tour .
Eduardo Damerco , the promoter of Dylan 's Spanish tour , said : " I do n't know what the situation is with regards to the area .
This is a matter for those who are organising the concert .
I do n't know what Dylan thinks of this , either . "
José Manuel Jiménez Blázquez , environmental spokeswoman for Castilla y León regional government , said that concert - goers would have to leave their cars outside the park and walk to the venue .
Buses would also ferry in concert workers .
He said € 10 ( £ 7.90 ) from each ticket would be donated to conservation schemes in the park .
Sting faced the wrath of environmental activists when he planned to play in the same parkland in 2006 .
After talks with protesters , the Police singer , a well - known eco-campaigner , asked organisers to change the venue and instead performed outside the Sierra de Gredos .

Facebook LONDON  J.K.
Rowling said she was sad , but relieved , to have completed the final Harry Potter book as she greeted fans at the European premiere of the latest movie in the young wizard saga .
Hundreds of fans — dozens of whom had camped overnight to secure a spot in front of a London cinema — waved flags , placards and scarves as Rowling and the film 's stars arrived at London 's Leicester Square .
Rowling 's Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , the seventh and final volume in the series , will be published July 21 .
" Finishing it was very , very emotional .
It was a combination of relief and sadness really , " she said .
Fans pleaded for clues , seeking to learn the answer to the most hotly anticipated plot twist : Will Harry die ?
Rowling said details are a secret from even her own family .
" I 'll want to know what the people in my house think of it , " she said .
Leicester Square was draped in green and gold for the premiere of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix to imitate the movie 's Ministry of Magic .
Fan Janice Brophy , 20 , said she had camped in the square since early Tuesday to be sure of a spot close to the theater .
" To be here , in the inner sanctum of the Ministry of Magic is amazing , " Brophy said .
" I 'm such a big fan . "
Daniel Radcliffe , Rupert Grint and Emma Watson were among the stars who attended the event .
They have starred in all five Harry Potter movies .
" We 're a big gang , " said Watson .
" We call it the Harry Potter family . "
Radcliffe , who stars as Potter , said the newest film was darker than the previous four , which presented a new acting challenge .
" They 're more challenging but that 's what makes them more exciting for me as an actor , " Radcliffe said .
" That 's a lot more fun to do than just the action side of things . "
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix opens in the U.S. on July 11 and in Britain the following day .

BALTIMORE - Body - scanning machines that show images of people underneath their clothing are being installed in 10 of the nation 's busiest airports in one of the biggest public uses of security devices that reveal intimate body parts .
The Transportation Security Administration recently started using body scans on randomly chosen airline passengers in Los Angeles , Baltimore , Denver , Albuquerque and New York 's Kennedy airport .
Airports in Dallas , Detroit , Las Vegas and Miami will be added this month .
Reagan National Airport near Washington starts using a body scanner today .
A total of 38 machines will be in use within weeks .
" It 's the wave of the future , " said James Schear , the TSA security director at Baltimore - Washington International Airport , where two body scanners are in use at one checkpoint .
Schear said the scanners could eventually replace metal detectors at the nation 's 2,000 airport checkpoints and the pat - downs done on passengers who need extra screening .
" We 're just scratching the surface of what we can do with whole - body imaging , " Schear said .
In Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport , where scanners have been tested since last year as an alternative to pat - downs , 90 percent of passengers choose to be scanned , the TSA says .
" Most passengers do n't think it 's any big deal , " Schear said .
" They think it 's a piece of security they 're willing to do . "
The TSA effort could encourage scanners ' use in rail stations , arenas and office buildings , the American Civil Liberties Union said .
" This may well set a precedent that others will follow , " said Barry Steinhardt , head of the ACLU technology project .
Scanners are used in a few courthouses , jails and U.S. embassies , as well as overseas border crossings , military checkpoints and some foreign airports such as Amsterdam 's Schiphol .
' The ultimate answer '
The scanners bounce harmless " millimeter waves " off passengers who are selected to stand inside a portal with arms raised after clearing the metal detector .
A TSA screener in a nearby room views the black - and - white image and looks for objects on a screen that are shaded differently from the body .
Finding a suspicious object , a screener radios a colleague at the checkpoint to search the passenger .
The TSA says it protects privacy by blurring passengers ' faces and deleting images right after viewing .
Yet the images are detailed , clearly showing a person 's gender .
" You can actually see the sweat on someone 's back , " Schear said .
The scanners aim to strengthen airport security by spotting plastic and ceramic weapons and explosives that evade metal detectors and are the biggest threat to aviation .
Government audits have found that screeners miss a large number of weapons , bombs and bomb parts such as wires and timers that agents sneak through checkpoints .
" I 'm delighted by this development , " said Clark Kent Ervin , the former Homeland Security inspector general whose reports urged the use of body scanners .
" This really is the ultimate answer to increasing screeners ' ability to spot concealed weapons . "
The scanners do a good job seeing under clothing but cannot see through plastic or rubber materials that resemble skin , said Peter Siegel , a senior scientist at the California Institute of Technology .
" You probably could find very common materials that you could wrap around you that would effectively obscure things , " Siegel said .
' You have to go along with it '
Passengers who went through a scanner at the Baltimore airport last week were intrigued , reassured and occasionally wary .
The process took about 30 seconds on average .
Stepping into the 9 - foot - tall glass booth , Eileen Reardon of Baltimore looked startled when an electronic glass door slid around the outside of the machine to create the image of her body .
" Some of this stuff seems a little crazy , " Reardon said , " but in this day and age , you have to go along with it . "
Scott Shafer of Phoenix did n't mind a screener looking at him underneath his shorts and polo shirt from a nearby room .
The door is kept shut and blocked with floor screens .
" I do n't know that person back there .
I 'll never seem them , " Shafer said .
" Everything personal is taken out of the equation . "
Steinhardt of the ACLU said passengers would be alarmed if they saw the image of their body .
" It all seems very clinical and non-threatening - you go through this portal and do n't have any idea what 's at the other end , " he said .
Passengers scanned in Baltimore said they did not know what the scanner did and were not told why they were directed into the booth .
Magazine - sized signs are posted around the checkpoint explaining the scanners , but passengers said they did not notice them .
Darin Scott of Miami was annoyed by the process .
" If you do n't ask questions , they do n't tell you anything , " Scott said .
When he asked a screener technical questions about the scanner , " he could not answer , " Scott said .
TSA spokeswoman Sterling Payne said the agency is studying passenger reaction and could " get more creative " about informing passengers .
" If passengers have questions , " she said , " they need to ask the questions . "
Passengers can decline to go through a scanner , but they will face a pat - down .
Schear , the Baltimore security director , said only 4 percent of passengers decline .

COMICS WITH PROBLEMS # 24 - D- Doh-D-DON'T BRUISE THAT PIG !
( Unsure of date - 1940s or 50s )
man , what an unfortunate and unintended history reference .
W e were preparing issue 23 of comics with problems today ( February 17 - 18 ' 08 ) when news of the largest meat recall in U.S. history came across the wires .
The root cause of the recall ?
Animal abuse , and the blending of bruised animals with otherwise safe meat .
It reminded us immediately of " Easy Does It " , an extremely obscure gutbusting advocacy pamphlet on animal mistreatment that we 've been holding onto for a while now .
So , given the current events we 've decided to bump this comic forward from its cue in line and post two problems today : issue 23 along with this one , issue 24 .
" Easy Does It " is one of the weirdest items ever produced .
Want the joke ?
It is an animal rights pamphlet intended for slaughterhouses .
It 's one of our favorite unknown archive documents , and now seems like as good time a time as any to post it .
Full scans below .
The basic thought behind this very early Swift & Company booklet is to be nice to livestock because harming them bruises the merchandise and affects profits .
Fine enough message .
But it was the attempt to ' cheer it up ' by framing things in a Disney - like comic book message that makes this booklet so damn nuts .
I mean just look down there at the cover with that pig getting slapped on its ass , Smiling , like it 's in on the joke !
We 're dealing with a lot of gruesome brutal harm here , all put to a really strange laugh track .
It 's funny , or it is n't , but here are pages and pages of happy farm animals getting their necks snapped , slapped around by clubs , whips , forks , electric prods , rakes , nails .
They lose limbs , are shoved into walls , trampled , You name it .
But this is n't a PETA brochure , AGAIN , this is a slaughterhouse one !
One truly unique anti-cruelty booklet that completely confuses what is normally a pretty cut and dried two - sided issue .
And it 's likely you will never see anything else like it .
So , Presenting a great pamphlet on animal mistreatment - But for Reasons You Wo n't Expect !
It 's EASY DOES IT
Here you go , beneath the jump , large scans of the whole thing .
Note : Pardon the rough presentation .
I will have this in normal Comics With Problems format in a week or so , in the meantime click on each thumbnail for a larger view - Thanks , Ethan ( main archive index )

In Washington , Mr. Tower began summoning Mr. McCain for a drink at the end of the day .
And when they traveled , Mr. McCain took charge of supplying Mr. Tower ’s hotel rooms with Johnnie Walker Black .
One night at a hotel in Saudi Arabia , one of many Middle Eastern countries where alcohol is banned , Mr. McCain amused his patron by leaving empty bottles for the authorities to find outside the room of a group of Frenchmen  a prank Mr. Tower later delighted at recounting .
The Texan also influenced Mr. McCain ’s approach to politics .
Mr. Tower , who as a graduate student in London had studied the prewar British Conservative Party , saw in President Carter shades of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain ’s appeasement , his former aides recalled .
As the senior Republican on the Armed Services Committee , Mr. Tower hammered Mr. Carter over the hostages in Iran , support for Taiwan , SALT II and the Soviet invasion in Afghanistan  debates Mr. Tower and other hawks saw as skirmishes in a larger battle over whether America would shrink from confrontation or return to the offensive after Vietnam .
“ McCain was a rapt student , ” said Mr. Dawson , the former Tower aide .
“ He followed the debates , and he would take part in them in ways that went way beyond his position as bag - carrier or representative of the Navy . ”
Mr. Tower was so close to his protégé that he sometimes raised eyebrows by including Mr. McCain in committee staff meetings that were closed to other military liaisons , Mr. Kiland said .
His close ties with Mr. Tower , in turn , helped Mr. McCain earn high marks from his Navy bosses , although with some reservations about his grasp for details .
“ Sometimes you had to really explain things to him and put him in a context that he really appreciated , ” said former Adm.
George Kinnear , Captain McCain ’s Pentagon superior .
“ But he was a hard worker once he bought off on an issue . ”
Mr. McCain , with his fame and family , would circumvent the Navy ’s chain of command for senators with issues like fighting a base closure , pushing for a new Navy hospital or helping a local contractor , aides said .
“ McCain had a big Rolodex , we used to say , ” recalled Michael Hastings , a former Cohen aide .
“ He could really deliver for senators on both sides of the aisle . ”
Over time , Captain McCain also became a minor political player in his own right , sometimes working against the Navy ’s official position under the Carter administration .
To agitate for laws boosting military pay , former aides said , Mr. McCain steered senators on a trip to Norfolk , Va. , toward Navy seamen collecting food stamps .
And when the secretary of the Navy declined to replace a giant aircraft carrier , Mr. McCain collected information inside the Navy for lobbyists pushing to build a new one , eventually helping to override a presidential veto .
This Wednesday , about fifteen hundred Belgian students simultaneously inserted Mentos into Diet Coke bottles in Ladeuzeplein Square , instantly breaking what must be one of the world ’s most obscure records , reports Natalie Paris of Britain ’s Telegraph .
And , not that you care , but here ’s a scientific explanation of why this works from The Disgruntled Chemist :
The reason that the soda erupts so violently from the bottle is actually twofold : a decrease of the surface tension of the soda ( due to dissolving Mentos ) , and an increase in nucleation sites ( sites where bubbles of CO 2 can form ) within the bottle ( due to the rough
Mentos surface ) .
Both of these factors make the carbon dioxide in the soda less likely to stay dissolved and more likely to become gaseous .
The fountain effect is from all of the CO 2 going from dissolved to gaseous at once , and at a great rate .
And here ’s a video of the event set , curiously , to what sounds like Jock Jams , the early 90s middle - school favorite .
The previous record holders appear to be these good Dutch folks , who set the record back in September , and also like techno and becoming Mentos marketing minions :

LOS ANGELES ( Hollywood Reporter ) - Hulk smash .
Universal happy .
“ The Incredible Hulk ” returns to theaters on June 13 with tie - in partners including Burger King , 7 - Eleven , Kmart , mall retailers , grocery store brands Pringles and Sargento , Airheads candy and Hasbro toys .
As part of the push , the big green gamma - rayed guy will appear on a tricked - out custom motorcycle to be built during a cable TV show , and on hacker - fighting software in Best Buy and other big - box stores .
Still to be determined is whether audiences will embrace the do -over of 2003 ’s disappointing big - screen “ Hulk . ”
Comic fans are a tough sell and , as Universal and Marvel Studios found , so are promotional partners who remember Ang Lee ’s angsty version .
The $ 150 million movie made a disappointing $ 132 million in North America , and less internationally .
In pitching French director Louis Leterrier ’s current incarnation of the famous superhero , studio executives went to great lengths to tell potential partners how this “ Hulk ” would be different -- and successful .
“ We know the ‘ Hulk ’ from 2003 did n’t satisfy the fans , and we had to acknowledge that , ” said Stephanie Sperber , executive vp of Universal Studios Partnerships .
“ We emphasized the passion that fans still have for this character and that this is the movie people have always wanted . ”
Key points of difference : Hulk ( Edward Norton ) is more clearly defined as a hero , which is both partner and merchandise friendly .
He has a high - profile nemesis in the Abomination ( Tim Roth ) , and he ’s in love ( with Liv Tyler ) .
Even the new name should give partners like 7 - Eleven an outsized hook for themed products .
The Incredible Gulp , anyone ?

Story Highlights • State Department considers Mujahedeen - e- Khalq a terrorist group
• Group 's camp in Iraq protected by coalition forces
• Mujahedeen - e- Khalq provides valuable intelligence on Iran
• Iraqi government demands group leave Iraqi soil
Adjust font size :
BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) --
An Iranian opposition group based in Iraq , labeled a terrorist organization by the United States , gets protection from the U.S. military despite Iraqi pressure to leave the country .
The U.S. considers the Mujahedeen - e - Khalq , or MEK , a source of valuable intelligence on Iran .
The group also is credited with helping expose Iran 's secret nuclear program through spying on Tehran for decades .
Iranian officials tied the MEK to an explosion in February at a girls school in Zahedan , Iran .
( Full story )
The U.S. State Department considers the MEK a terrorist organization -- meaning no American can deal with it ; U.S. banks must freeze its assets ; and any American giving support to its members is committing a crime .
The U.S. military , though , regularly escorts MEK supply runs between Baghdad and its base , Camp Ashraf .
" The trips for procurement of logistical needs also take place under the control and protection of the MPs , " said Mojgan Parsaii , vice president of MEK and leader of Camp Ashraf .
That 's because , according to U.S. documents , coalition forces regard MEK as protected people under the Geneva Conventions .
" The coalition remains deeply committed to the security and rights of the protected people of Ashraf , " U.S. Maj .
Gen. John D. Gardner wrote in March 2006 .
The group also enjoys the protection of the International Committee of the Red Cross .
" The ICRC has made clear that the residents of Camp Ashraf must not be deported , expelled or repatriated , " according to an ICRC letter .
Despite repeated requests , neither Iran 's ambassador in Baghdad nor the U.S. military would comment on MEK , also known as Mojahedin Khalq Organization , or MKO .
The State Department said Friday the Geneva Conventions protections apply only to MEK residents of Camp Ashraf , and the organization as a whole and its members elsewhere are subject to prosecution for terrorist or criminal acts .
" We still regard them as a terrorist organization , " former U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad said .
When the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003 , Green Berets arrived at Camp Ashraf to find gardens and monuments , along with more than 2,000 well - maintained tanks , armored personnel carriers , artillery , anti-aircraft guns and vehicles .
All 3,800 camp residents were questioned by Americans .
No arrests were made , and the camp quickly surrendered under a cease - fire agreement -- an agreement that also guaranteed its safety .
" Everyone 's entry to the camp and his departure are controlled by the U.S. military police force , " Parsaii said .
The MEK denies it is a terrorist group .
Both Iran and the Iraqi government , however , accuse the group of ongoing terrorist attacks , and the Shiite - dominated Iraqi government wants it out .
" We gave this organization a six - month deadline to leave Iraq , and we informed the Red Cross , " said Shirwan al - Wa'eli , Iraq 's national security minister .
" And presumably , our friends the Americans will respect our decision and they will not stay on Iraqi land . "
For now , however , the United States continues to protect MEK .
" There are counter - pressures , too , " Khalilzad said .
" There are people who say , ' No , they should be allowed to stay here . '
And as you know , around the world there are people with different views toward them . "
Ms Rice is herself criticised in the book US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has rejected claims from a former White House press aide that President George W Bush misled the US over the Iraq war .
Ms Rice refused to comment directly on the book by Scott McClellan but said Mr Bush had been " very clear " about the reasons for going to war .
She said the US had not been alone in believing Iraq was a serious threat .
Mr McClellan has accused Mr Bush of a lack of openness and having relied on a " propaganda campaign " to sell the war .
His 341 - page memoir , What Happened : Inside the Bush White House and Washington 's Culture of Deception , is to be published on Monday .
Extracts quoted by US media give an often scathing view of both the president and his highest - ranking aides .
From July 2003 to his resignation in April 2006 , Mr McClellan was a loyal defender of the Bush administration .
He had previously worked for Mr Bush when he was Texas governor .
' Puzzled '
The book has provoked strong reactions from supporters of the Bush administration .
Ms Rice , speaking in Sweden at an international conference on Iraq , told reporters : " I am not going to comment on a book that I have n't read .
If he thinks he 's going to ingratiate himself to his critics , he 's sorely mistaken , and unfortunately , the only friends he had , he just lost
Dan Bartlett
" But what I will say is that the concern about weapons of mass destruction was the fundamental reason [ for going to war ] . "
In the memoir , Mr McClellan depicts Ms Rice as being " more interested in figuring out where the president stood and carrying out his wishes " than helping him understand the consequences of war .
He says she " was somehow able to keep her hands clean " but predicts that " history will likely judge her harshly " .
Mr Bush has yet to comment on the book himself , but White House spokeswoman Dana Perino issued a statement on Wednesday dismissing Mr McClellan as " disgruntled " .
She added : " For those of us who fully supported him , before , during and after he was press secretary , we are puzzled .
It is sad - this is not the Scott we knew . "
Former senior Bush adviser Karl Rove , now a political commentator for Fox News , attacked Mr McClellan for not speaking up sooner if he had concerns about White House policies .
Former White House counsellor Dan Bartlett was also critical of his one - time colleague .
" If he thinks he 's going to ingratiate himself to his critics , he 's sorely mistaken , and unfortunately , the only friends he had , he just lost , " Mr Bartlett said , quoted by Reuters news agency .
Katrina mishandling
In his memoir , Mr McClellan says that Mr Bush was not " open and forthright " on Iraq and accuses him of " rushing to war with inadequate planning and preparation for its aftermath " .
Mr McClellan criticises Mr Bush 's handling of Iraq and Hurricane Katrina Mr McClellan stops short of saying Mr Bush lied about the reasons for going to war in Iraq - a war the former press aide judges " not necessary " and a " serious strategic blunder " .
However , the way the Bush administration managed the Iraq issue " almost guaranteed that the use of force would become the only feasible option " , he says .
Mr McClellan describes
White House staff as spending much of the first week after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 " in a state of denial " .
He also accuses former senior Bush strategist Karl Rove and Lewis " Scooter " Libby , Vice - President Dick Cheney 's former chief of staff , of misleading him about a CIA leak case involving White House staff .

The car of tomorrow will make senior citizens better , safer drivers and let them know when they ought to hang up the keys for good .
It also could tell the DMV .
Researchers at MIT 's AgeLab are building the " Aware Car , " a Volvo XC90 packed with cameras , monitors and sensors that keep tabs on drivers and their behavior to improve safety .
The technology wo n't be ready for another 20 years – but that 's about the time the last of the Baby Boomers will have turned 65 and one in four drivers will be that age or older .
AgeLab studies the quality - of - life issues of an aging population , and the idea behind the Aware Car is n't getting older drivers off the road but allowing them to drive safely as long as possible .
The $ 1.5 - million vehicle also could help automakers design safer cars , and it's one of several ongoing efforts to build the ultimate " nanny car " ( More on that after the jump ) .
" When you 're driving , you 're responsible for yourself and for the safety of those around you , " says AgeLab researcher Bryan Reimer .
" Big Brother is trying to provide you with the information you need to make safe decisions . "
Because Big Brother is providing a lot of the money Reimer and his colleagues are spending , the technology also could give the government the means to evaluate drivers ' competency behind the wheel and determine whether it 's time to yank their licenses .
The guys are AgeLab have outfitted the car with cameras and infrared sensors that observe a driver 's eyes and eyelid movements .
Start nodding off ?
The car will tell you to pull over and get some rest .
Sensors in the center console monitor heart rate , blood pressure and respiration .
Blood - sugar dips ?
The car will tell you to get a bite to eat .
Still more sensors keep tabs on the car 's speed and trajectory .
A hard drive in the trunk collects and analyzes the data .
The idea is to build a car that learns the drivers ' habits , then reacts appropriately when the driver alters them .
" Making technology more responsive to older drivers makes it safer for all generations , " AgeLab director Joseph Coughlin told the Boston Globe .
" The notion is driver well - being , a wellness approach to driving . "
The U.S. Department of Transportation 's New England University
Transportation Center is subsidizing the research to the tune of $ 6.8 million with additional backing by the auto industry .
The payoff is the billions that could be saved in human and capital costs now and when Boomers become seniors .
The Census Bureau predicts the number of people aged 65 and older will more than double , from 35.1 million to 86.7 million , between 2000 and 2050 .
According to a Government Accounting
Office study released last year , drivers 65 to 74 are more likely to be involved in a fatal crash than all but the youngest drivers ( 16 - 24 ) .
Drivers older than 74 are the most likely to have a deadly accident .
The report also notes older drivers increasingly will be exposed to crash risks because Boomer will , in all likelihood , drive more often – and longer distances – than their parents did .
Some of the technology that the Aware Car uses , such as lane - changing sensors and GPS , already is found on production cars , and Volvo is using similar technology to create a crash - proof car by 2020 .
Stanford University researchers are developing a car that collects information such as where and how fast you drive to make motorists better drivers and save them time .
Reimer said AgeLab is still in the initial phase of the research and the more advanced technologies probably wo n't be available on vehicles for at least 25 years .
AgeLab 's research could provide state DOTs with more accurate ways to assess aging drivers ' abilities and yield valuable data on what influences safe and unsafe driving , said the Elinor Ginzler of AARP .
" The more data we have , the better we 're going to be able to address those issues . "
As with research by Stanford 's CarLab , it 's another example of Big
Brother riding shotgun in the future and , in the case of the Aware Car , telling you when it 's time to turn over the keys .

Ever since Robert Rubin began the tradition in the mid-1990s , it has been a significant element of the Treasury Secretary�s job description to continuously state that a strong dollar is in the national interest .
It is widely regarded that such utterances , if repeated often enough , can constitute the sum total of what is still laughingly known as the nation�s �strong dollar policy . �
Over the past two generations , the American government has launched many failed campaigns .
To name just a few , there has been the war on drugs , the war on poverty , and the continued attempts to improve education .
But the strong dollar policy must be seen as the poster child for all failed Federal policies .
However , many in the market took cheer that the policy is now being greatly expanded .
In an unprecedented move , the Fed Chairman is now adding his voice to the chorus and using the same rhetoric previously used by Treasury alone .
That �s two people saying the words �not just one .
A double barrel strong dollar policy !
As the administration is so fond of saying , a nation�s currency reflects the underlying strength of its economy , and in that sense can be seen as a nation�s economic report card .
In truth , a strong currency is in the interest of every nation , just as good grades are in the interest of every student .
Using this basic analogy , a flunking student cannot improve his grades by simply telling his parents , teachers , and fellow students that he has adopted a �straight A policy . �
If his words are not accompanied by a change in actual behavior , whereby he stops cutting class , and starts studying more , his new policy is unlikely to achieve results .
So long as his bad habits persist , the policy will not be any more effective simply because one of his friends chimes in .
In his speech this past Tuesday , Ben Bernanke finally admitted that the weakness in the dollar was contributing to both higher inflation and elevated inflation expectations .
This stands in stark contrast to his recent testimony in front of the House Banking Committee , where in response to a question asked by Congressman Ron Paul , he confidently declared that the weakness of the dollar only effected Americans who travel abroad .
It is amazing how little attention this complete reversal received .
The media of course wasted no time in declaring that Bernanke�s speech heralded the opening of a new front in the campaign against the falling dollar .
For example , CNBC�s Larry Kudlow proclaimed that Bernanke had endorsed � King Dollar� ( someone needs to remind Kudlow that the king has long since abdicated his throne ) and the network ran an entire segment on how to profit from the new dollar rally .
All of this because Bernanke merely mentioned the dollar , acknowledged its effects on inflation , and expressed concern for its plight .
As far as the media and Wall Street are concerned , words without action are enough .
Too bad that �s not the way things work here on the planet Earth .
The real take away from Bernanke�s comment is not that the dollar is about to rally , but that it is now more likely to sink even lower .
I believe the main reason Bernanke has refrained from mentioning the dollar in the past is that he did not want to be put in a position of actually having to do something about its decline .
He is now so fearful of an imminent dollar collapse that he must have felt compelled to throw down the gauntlet despite his fear that someone might actually pick it up .
My guess is that currency traders will ultimately see this as an act of desperation .
When the dollar keeps falling a chorus will swell to demand that the Fed put teeth in its new policy .
If Bernanke does nothing the world will finally see a naked emperor and the dollar�s decline will turn into a rout .
If , on the other hand , the Fed raises rates to defend the dollar , and only a short term bounce results , then all remaining confidence in the Fed�s ability to support the dollar will evaporate as well .
This is probably Bernanke�s greatest fear and is likely the main reason he waited so long before mentioning the dollar .
The fact that he felt compelled to do so now likely means he knows the game is coming to an end .

Technologia Aeroespacial Mexicana ( TAM ) has designed a strap - on helicopter .
Tiny rockets on the tips of the propellers eliminate the need for a tail rotor , making it possible for the device to be worn on a human body .
Credit : TAM .
Ever since the first human saw a bird soaring through the clouds , our species has harbored a great envy for the freedom that flying gives .
Now a company from Mexico is trying to capitalize on this desire with their design for a strap - on helicopter , which is intended to be worn on the back of an individual and lift them into the air .
The idea is not new , but the technology may have some novelty , although details are sparse .
Technologia Aeroespacial Mexicana ( TAM ) , the company behind the Libelula strap - on helicopter , explains on its
Web site how the device is powered by two hydrogen fuel canisters .
Tiny rockets at the tips of the helicopter´s rotor blades take the place of a tail rotor , a component which couldn´t be safely attached to a human body .
According to the company , the Libelula would be the lightest helicopter in the world , so light that it could be strapped to a person´s body with a carbon fiber corset .
" The best [ part ] of this technology is that [ these ] kinds of helicopters don´t need a tail rotor because they don´t have any torque , so with a simple vane they can turn - being the simplest form of an helicopter and the easiest and safer to fly , " the company says on its Web site .
At the moment , the idea is just an idea .
However , the company has a successful history of developing and fabricating a variety of hydrogen peroxide rockets , jet packs , a flying rocket belt , rocket bicycles , and other similar machines .
And on its
Web site , the company claims to have most of the components for the Libelula helicopter - many of which are the same as those on the rocket belt - and suggests that it is only a matter of time before embarking on a test flight .

Here 's a question that 's rarely asked in polite company : Did our government over - react to the September 11 attacks ?
Here 's another :
Was our reaction exactly what Osama bin Laden hoped for ?
According to John Mueller , a professor at Ohio State University , the answer to both questions is " yes . "
He explains why in Overblown : How Politicians and the Terrorism Industry Inflate National Security Threats and We Believe Them .
Mueller is no pacifist -- one would hardly expect the Woody Hayes Chair of National Security Studies to be one -- but rather a hard - nosed pragmatist who adds up the minuses as well as the pluses of going to war .
In the case of September 11 , he found that our response to the attacks cost us more than the attacks themselves .
The costs range from lost productivity due to ( probably ineffective ) airport security measures to the massively wasteful Department of Homeland Security .
Not to mention needless fear ; inattention to even worse threats such as global warming ; and especially the Iraq war , which was partly the result of post - September 11 rage .
The author makes several politically incorrect points about September 11 .
To begin with , we lost .004 percent of our population , a number not remotely likely to topple a country .
( Iran , whose population is a fraction of ours , recently lost 30,000 of its citizens in an earthquake . )
What will bring us down is anti-terrorism measures that unravel our constitutional structure , such as President Bush 's assertion of sweeping war powers .
Mueller also contends that the 11 attacks were a one - off ; everything fell into place for the terrorists , in part because they ran a low - tech operation .
He maintains that a chemical or biological attack is extremely difficult to pull off because of the logistics involved in developing and deploying such weapons .
And staging a nuclear attack is tougher still , since it requires a huge cadre of technically trained people -- assuming they can get their hands on fissile material in the first place .
Even more provocative is the author 's explanation of why the United States has n't been hit since September 11 : there are n't many terrorists inside our borders , and those who are here lack the motivation and talent .
Meanwhile , the FBI makes the incredible claim that its failure to find a bona fide cell proves that terrorists are out there .
Mueller goes even further and argues that we 've over - reacted to security threats going back to Pearl Harbor .
After the Japanese attacked , our government adopted a policy of unconditional surrender , which entailed a long and costly war in the Pacific .
The author believes that a policy of containment , plus limited military action at the borders of the Japanese empire , would have thwarted further attacks and perhaps paid dividends in the form of a more stable postwar Asia .
At home , Mueller points out , we also over - reacted to Pearl Harbor by interning tens of thousands of Japanese Americans , even no spies or saboteurs were found among that population .
In like manner , authorities rounded up thousands of Arabs and Muslims after September 11 but found few who had even tenuous links to terrorist groups .
Why , then , are America 's leaders so quick to use force ?
It was because the Allies under-reacted to Adolf Hitler , one of the few threats which -- as they discovered the hard way -- could n't be contained .
Since then , we 've gone off in the other direction , elevating tinpot dictators such as Panama 's Noriega , Libya 's Qadaffi , and of course , Saddam Hussein , to at least junior - varsity Hitler status .
Mueller 's approach toward terrorism is sensible .
He 'd like policymakers to focus their prevention efforts on WMD attacks and to figure out how to recover from lower - intensity attacks , which are not 100 - percent preventable .
In addition , he'd like both policymakers and the media to put the threat of terrorism in perspective .
Even taking September 11 into account , the average American is no more likely to be killed by terrorists than by lightning .
That , of course , is wishful thinking , and Mueller knows it .
If terrorists strike here again , public opinion will demand Draconian laws at home and military action overseas .
Even without an attack , it will take years for our national temperature to return to normal .
Mueller points out that fear of domestic Communism , provoked by the cases of Alger Hiss and the Rosenbergs , took years to subside -- even after the party virtually withered away in this country .
Furthermore , public opinion is inflamed by what Mueller calls the " terrorism industry " : opportunistic public officials , led by the president himself ; turf - conscious bureaucrats ; security profiteers , a class that includes media that thrive on fear - mongering ; and assorted other Americans with ideological axes to grind .
Also benefitting are the terrorists themselves , who have been elevated to celebrity status thanks to our obsession with them .
It 's unlikely that any politician of either party will endorse Mueller 's restrained approach toward terrorism .
Nevertheless , Overblown is a welcome contribution toward what has been a very one - sided discussion of the issue .
On paper , they look an awful lot like Hillary Rodham Clinton .
They are professional women of a certain age -- politically active Democrats , liberals , unabashed feminists who remember what it was like to be told they could not become firefighters or university department heads , let alone president of the United States of America .
They are women of accomplishment who have bumped up against glass ceilings , sometimes breaking them , while managing marriages , raising children and trying to make the world their version of a better place .
They have waited a long , long time for a plausible female presidential candidate .
You ’d think they ’d be rushing to support Clinton .
But they ca n’t stand her .
“ She leaves me cold , ” said Sidonie Smith , who chairs the University of Michigan English department .
“ I hate to say that .
It ’s a very strange feeling to have . ”

Like her husband , former President Clinton , Hillary Clinton has inspired highly mixed emotions over the years .
For the political right , she has served as a protean symbol of everything wrong with Democrats and feminists .
For upscale women on the left -- historically her toughest crowd -- negative reaction has been more nuanced .
Polls show that blue - collar women see her as a defender of their economic interests .
But their well - educated upper - middle - class sisters , who are n’t as worried about job security , feel free to judge her as they would a peer .
She has recently gained substantial ground with this constituency , but polls continue to show that fully half of college - educated Democratic women do not support her .
The reasons vary .
For many , it ’s visceral .
While they struggled to break through institutional barriers in the workplace , Clinton hitched her star to her man and followed him to the top .
When his philandering imperiled his political career , she not only pulled him out of the fire but helped orchestrate attacks against his accusers .
For others , the anger they feel is purely political .
Some are disappointed by her support of the Iraq war , her reluctance to take stands on some hot - button issues or the fact that she has re-created herself as a centrist .

‘ Sanctimoniousness ’
In an essay in the November issue of the Atlantic Monthly , Caitlin Flanagan wrote that she was put off by Clinton ’s “ sanctimoniousness . ”
She wondered why “ so many of the most liberal and educated women are ambivalent about Hillary ? ” Flanagan ’s answer :
By sticking with a husband who has mistreated vulnerable women -- for the sake of her marriage , her child and her ambition -- she has made herself complicit in his unsavory behavior , and diminished the very best parts of herself .
On the Huffington Post blog , Nora Ephron described “ Hillary resisters ” ( and she is one ) as women who disapprove of her tendency to triangulate , deplore her position on the Iraq war and “ do n’t trust her as far as you can spit . ”
In the spring , University of Michigan communications studies professor Susan J. Douglas wrote an essay for the liberal journal In These Times called “ Why Women Hate Hillary . ”
And in an interview with LA Weekly last May , Jane Fonda called Clinton “ a ventriloquist for the patriarchy with a skirt and a vagina . ”

Some politics experts are baffled by the antipathy .
Perhaps women hold each other to an unrealistic standard , said Ruth B. Mandel , an expert on women and politics who is director of the Eagleton Institute at Rutgers University and counts herself among the baffled .
“ I do feel that people are just grumpy about her , ” Mandel said .
“ It is complex ideologically and psychologically -- ‘ I am mad at her because she did n’t divorce her husband , I am mad at her because she did n’t vote against the war . ’ ”
Seeking the perfect female candidate , concluded Mandel , could be called “ Waiting for the Goddess . ”
And because politics at the highest level requires compromise , a certain centrism and inevitably sullying hands - on experience , she added , “ You could spend a lifetime waiting for the perfect person to come along , and in politics , that ’s not gonna happen . ”
Ann Lewis , Clinton ’s director of women ’s outreach , is upbeat about Clinton ’s progress with this sector of voters and thinks it ’s only a matter of time till they come around .

“ I do believe that what you are describing are women on a different arc , ” Lewis said .
“ They take longer to make up their minds .
They want to make sure you are not going to let them down . ”
‘ A tragic figure ’
But the Hillary resisters -- who say they will vote for her if she becomes the nominee -- already feel that Clinton has let them down .
“ Hillary , in a sense , is a tragic figure , ” said Clara Oleson , a 65 - year - old retired lawyer and union educator in West Branch , Iowa , who supports Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill . ) .
“ She seems to feel she needs to be a social male -- aggressor , commander in chief . ”

Oleson takes umbrage at the assumption expressed by many of her women friends that she should vote for Clinton because she is a woman .
“ That is a phrase I have fought against my entire life ! ” said Oleson , a politically active feminist for decades .
Mary C. Kelley , 63 , chairs the University of Michigan ’s history department and is somewhat wistfully supporting former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina .
“ I strongly believe that it ’s feminism that made Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s presidency plausible .
Therefore , I would like a candidate who is not simply running like another man , and that ’s what I see in her self - presentation again and again and again . ”
To solidify and increase her support among women , Clinton has assiduously courted them .
Last month , she appeared on the female gabfest , ABC ’s morning program “ The View . ”
She told a union audience in Chicago that if they wanted a winner , “ I ’m your girl . ”
And she joked that at her age -- 60 -- she was happy to be receiving so much attention “ from all these men . ”
Her attempts to curry favor began to pay off .
Support for Clinton among college - educated women jumped from 29 % in June to 50 % in October , according to the most recent Los Angeles Times / Bloomberg poll .
Advertisement
Then came what is widely regarded to be her worst debate performance so far , in Philadelphia on Oct. 30 , when she gave conflicting answers to questions about driver ’s licenses for illegal immigrants , tax reform and the release of her White House papers .
Her opponents took her to task .
And she seemed to play the gender card , a risky move .
Her campaign complained about “ piling on ” by her male rivals .
Bill Clinton implied the critiques amounted to a “ Swift boating ” of his wife .
Kate Michelman , a prominent feminist who advises Edwards , accused Clinton of “ disingenuously playing the victim card . ”
Her standing in national polls dipped a bit , but she maintained her position as the national front - runner .
And in a subsequent debate on Nov. 15 , she made a point of saying that she did not feel her opponents attacked her because she is a woman , but because she is in the lead .
( In fact , in Iowa , site of the country ’s first nominating contest , she is in a dead heat with Obama , and Edwards is a close third . )
Wendy Kaminer , 57 , a lawyer and author , divides Hillary - resistant feminists into contemporaries of Clinton ’s , women who entered the post - college world believing they were fully equal to men , and women who are 10 or 20 years older .
Advertisement
Clinton ’s peers , said Kaminer , may take issue with her choices , while older women may take issue with her political style .
“ By putting her political ambitions on hold , or making a decision that the best way to satisfy them is to do it with her husband , well , I do n’t hold it against her , but it makes me less starry - eyed about her , ” Kaminer said .
As for the generation ahead of Clinton , “ What you may be hearing is the commitment to pacifism that some women associate with feminism , ” Kaminer said .
“ It ’s what I think of as the ‘ feminine ’ strain of feminism that sees women as bringing something special to the table because they are not militaristic , work by consensus and do n’t play the boys ’ game .
And Hillary is someone who has played the boys ’ game exceedingly well . ”
Too far to the center ?
Advertisement
Some feminists are deeply conflicted about their choice .
Jean Lloyd - Jones , a 78 - year - old former Iowa legislator courted by Democratic contenders , did n’t want to talk about it .
“ I did n’t call you back because I really did n’t want to have this conversation , ” Lloyd - Jones said .
“ I would be pleased to have a woman in the oval office .
But Hillary Clinton is not my first choice . ”
Lloyd - Jones , who feels that Clinton has moved too far to the center , is beholden to corporate interests and inspires such negative feeling she may have trouble winning a general election , has endorsed Obama .
If Clinton becomes the Democratic nominee , the Hillary holdouts said their objections would melt away .
Keeping a Republican out of the White House will become the paramount concern for Democrats , Hillary - resistant or otherwise .
As 83 - year - old Mori Costantino of Iowa City put it , “ If Hillary is nominated , I will hold my nose as I do with everybody else and support her .
I ’ve been doing that for years . ”

Obama headed for Republicans ' turf Associated Press
Published : Monday June 9 , 2008

Print This Email This By STEVEN R. HURST WASHINGTON -- Democrat Barack Obama on Monday begins a two - week tour of U.S. battleground states , aiming to draw sharp contrasts with Republican opponent John McCain -- especially on the struggling American economy that has been laid low by shrinking growth , bounding unemployment and staggering increases in energy costs .
McCain planned a series of fundraising stops first in Virginia and the country 's capital , looking for donors as the general election campaign begins in earnest now that Hillary Rodham Clinton suspended her bid for the Democratic nomination and robustly threw her support behind Obama over the weekend .
McCain will need all the financial help he can muster as he moves toward the November vote against Obama 's well - oiled fundraising machinery that has rolled up an astounding bankroll , much of it from small donors on the Internet .
Obama has raked in $ 264 million in 16 months .
McCain has raised less than half that much , $ 115 million , in 17 months .
On Monday , Obama also will travel to North Carolina -- a state that has not voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1976 -- to talk economics to an electorate increasingly edgy about its future .
The Illinois senator plans to push into other Republican bastions with his economic message , hoping to reverse history in places like Missouri , which has not voted for a Democrat since 1996 and Virginia , which last voted Democratic in 1964 .
By moving into such historically Republican states , Obama could force the McCain camp to spend precious resources defending traditionally home turf .
For his part , Obama faces the huge challenge of wooing the Clinton base , as the Democrats try to patch things up after what was an extended , exhausting and often bitter campaign .
Time grows short for Obama on that front with the party convention set for late August in Denver .
Through the primary season polls showed Clinton backers -- especially women and working class voters -- increasingly declaring they would vote for McCain rather than Obama .
While Obama feels comfortable with an offensive against McCain on the economy , which has badly faltered in the last months of the Republican Bush administration , the Arizona senator hopes to counter - punch with attacks on his opponent 's perceived lack of experience in the international arena .
But McCain is saddled with the Iraq war , which he supported at its inception and believes must continue to a still undefined U.S. victory .
And even if he can gain renewed traction with his Iraq policy , a war opposed by a majority of Americans , the issue has fallen off front pages as voters turn inward , concerned about their faltering economic prospects .
The national average price of regular grade gasoline crept up to US $ 4 a gallon for the first time over the weekend , passing the once - unthinkable milestone just in time for the peak summer travel season .
Both candidates stayed away from the nation 's media microphones Sunday .
McCain had no public events .
Obama and his family joined neighbors in Chicago for a bicycle ride along the Lake Michigan shoreline .

You have GOT to be kidding me !
You seem , in your infinite wisdom , to forget that the standard for counting ballots that Gore wanted was the one by which he lost .
There was a detailed study of the ballots by several news organizations years ago that concluded exactly the opposite of your story -- under most criteria for counting the ballots , Bush had more votes than Gore.
Period .

Molly -
Apparently you did n't bother to read your own link .
Or my story , apparently , in which I said that " if one bothers to count all of the ballots actually successfully cast ( if not counted ) in the state of Florida , as a media and academic consortium did , as seen at the link above , revealing that by every possible chad- counting standard ( hanging , pregnant , swinging , etc. ) Al Gore received more votes than George W. Bush .
Period . "
That , of course , is also what the story you linked to at WaPo said .
Yes , had Florida been counted only as Gore requested ( several recounts ) he would n't necessarily have won .
Had the entire state of Florida been recounted , as Bush wanted , then Gore would have won .
Either way , Gore received more votes in the state of Florida than did Bush .
Period .
Sorry you 're having trouble with that fact .
But reality hurts , I guess .

We 've never been contacted by the makers of HBO 's upcoming Recount film , which promises to be a theatrical re-telling of the 2000 Presidential Election Debacle in Florida .
Yet , we 'll chalk it up to one helluva / swelluva coincidence ,
They just stuck their noses in every so often to see what you had going on , and really liked the song in this context , as do I .
Good pictures of you looking reliable .
Great hair cut .
Re Molly , SteveIL , Yourkidding , and a couple of others :
I read most of the posts here , and the comments .
I recognize the frequent commentators such as Dredd or Agent99 by their writing style .
I mention that to point out that the writing style of the three mentioned above is flat and pompous .
Three or more people making nonsensical posts with the same writing style and point of view seems unlikely .
I wonder if you ( we ) are n't being spoofed ( I do n't know what else to call it ) by one or two people who put up comments that make no sense , so you spend lots of time explaining .
what a good way to make it so you can't investigate , write or sleep .
I do appreciate those explanations you gave to these folks , because they provide links and references to information that I may have missed or forgotten .
Good luck sorting it out .
Let me say again : Voters rights is not a Red or Blue state issue .
It is at the heart of the democracy .
The right of the citizenry to vote seems to be double teamed with the disenfranchisement of the elderly ( who are n't particularly liberal ) and others by the Repubs , and the whole voting machine scandal that makes hideous sense with people like Tony Krvaric ( R - CA ) calling the shots .
However , FOLLOW THE MONEY !

If it so pleases you , this is the " recent " Molly with a new name .
Once again , Bradley , your shamelessly self - promoting blog ignores that Gore did NOT ask for a complete recount of all the ballots .
The partial recount he requested would have still resulted in his loss .
Moreover , the story I posted illustrates how subjective the standards for " hanging , " " dangling , " and " pregnant " chads can be .
Under most standards ,
Gore would still have lost .
You have to get pretty loose in the rules and count even the slightest of indentations before Gore can be considered the winner .
This was not the standard used by any of Florida 's counties .
Bottom line : you can come up with any scenario you like by which Gore might have won , but none of them were possible , or at least likely , under the rules of the day .
Even Gore himself recognizes this .

Molly from Florida continued to embarrass herself by writing - Bradley , your shamelessly self - promoting blog ignores that Gore did NOT ask for a complete recount of all the ballots .
The partial recount he requested would have still resulted in his loss .
We did not , and have not ignored that at all .
I realize you just arrive here , without even a half a clue in your pocket , but I 've discussed that report many times , and have oft noted the irony that had Bush gotten what he wanted ( a full state count ) , he would have lost .
Had Gore gotten what he asked for ( recount in several counties ) he would have lost .
Irony abounds .
None of that , however , distracts from the point of my article statement in the original post above which said that Gore received more votes in the state of Florida then Bush .
Despite Bush having been awarded the state by the Supreme Court who disallowed the state to count their ballots .
As to the story you linked to , it was , in fact , based on the same report I originally linked to .
And --- if you bother to read the study --- you 'll see that by every conceivable counting standard , as I originally reported above , when all ballots were counted , Gore won .
Period .
That was , no matter if you included pregnant , hanging , swinging chads , etc .
Pick a counting standard , and Gore received more votes in Florida .
Period .
And while you claim to live in Florida , I 'm actually good friends with the fellow put in charge of the recount by the state .
He 'll be happy to confirm all that I 've told you .
Though the report from the a consortium of academics and media outlets ( not the GAO , as 99 inaccurately suggested above ) is quite clear , and no serious person has challenged the group as " partisan " , much less a " left - wing think tank . "
Again , sorry you do n't care for that .
But facts are facts .
Bottom line : you can come up with any scenario you like by which Gore might have won , but none of them were possible , or at least likely , under the rules of the day .
Even Gore himself recognizes this .
Wrong .
Because Bush argued that recounting on a few counties was illegal ( it was n't ) , a full state count could have continued , and --- by any standard used for counting the ballots ---
Gore would have won .
Lucky for you , the Supremes undermined democracy , legislated from the bench , defied all " conservative " jurisprudence which keeps the feds out of state issues , and awarded the " Presidency " to the man who received the fewer votes .

Brad ,
This is the first time that I find myself disagreeing with you .
You say :
We did not , and have not ignored that at all .
I realize you just arrive here , without even a half a clue in your pocket , but I 've discussed that report many times , and have oft noted the irony that had Bush gotten what he wanted ( a full state count ) , he would have lost .
Had Gore gotten what he asked for ( recount in several counties ) he would have lost .
That statement is only partially correct , but it is also very wrong .
This part you got right : Initially , Gore called for a recount in only a few counties ( Broward , Dade , Palm Beach ) .
He felt the pressure of the time constraint to have the recount .
But about one week into the recount , Gore called on Bush to join with him for a FULL STATEWIDE RECOUNT .
Bush refused .
Those are the facts .
There were 175,000 spoiled votes in Florida , of which 65,000 were the famous UNDERVOTES ( chads ) .
The other 110,000 were OVERVOTES , BALLOTS WERE DOUBLE AND TRIPLE - PUNCHED .
Gore 's name was punched on approximately 75,000 ballots , Bush on less than 30,000 .
So Gore was the clear winner of the OVERPUNCHED ballots which were never allowed to enter the recount .
Read about the 2000 election here :
http://www.geocities.com...ectionFraudAnalytics.pdf
UNCOUNTED VOTES ARE A FACT IN EVERY ELECTION .
THERE WERE 5 MILLION UNCOUNTED VOTES IN 2000 .
The Census figure is 110.8 m votes , as compared to the official recorded 105.4 m
In every election , millions of mostly Democratic votes are never counted – and are a significant contribution to the exit poll discrepancies .
According to the 2000 Census , approximately 5 million votes were never counted .
Since they were from heavily democratic minority districts , if Gore won 75 % his true margin was close to 3 million votes - not the 540,000 recorded .
And that does not include the very real possibility that a certain percentage of recorded Gore votes were switched to Bush .
The 2000 election was not even close , although the media would like us to believe it was .
Only the 5 - 4 Supreme Court decision was close .
Consider the Florida 2000 fiasco .
Bush ‘ won ’ by 537 ‘ official ’ votes - before the recount was aborted .
But 185,000 spoiled ( under and over - punched ) ballots were never counted .
Since approximately 65 % of them were intended for Gore , he actually won the state by at least 60,000 votes .

All you ever hear about is how the devious Al Gore only wanted to count the counties he thought would help him win .

In an interview with politico.com , writer Danny Strong says , in essence , that he gave Ron Klain and Jim Baker free reign in reviewing and changing his script .
He says he interviewed a number of other participants but conveniently fails to indicate whether they included Al Gore , Joe Lieberman , Warren Christopher or Bill Daley .
It 's known that he did n't give Christopher a copy of the script and did n't contact either Christopher or Daley until shooting began .

Re: Recount
" What Really Happened " ?
Not .
Danny Strong , late of Buffy the Vampire Slayer , was so anxious to have his first script picked up that he decided to make it up as he went His " research " was focused exclusively on supporting the thesis that Bush won the recount because the Dems -- and , in particular , Warren Christopher -- were wimps .
This is the same Warren Christopher , by the way , who got scores of American hostages out of Iran in the late seventies and who served in the Pacific during the Second World War .
In an NYT story published yesterday , Strong admits to waiting to contact Christopher until the the day the scenes involving his character were shot .
He also admits not giving Christopher a copy of the script , even though he did so for Jim Baker and Ron Klain , who were also allowed to give notes and to veto lines and scenes .
Danny wants us to believe he had the time to find and commission Christopher 's tailor to make a suit for Christopher 's character , but was too busy to talk to the guy whose measurements he was using .
So much for accuracy and / or plain fairness .
Strong should write a docudrama about what " really " happened on the Buffy set and stay away from serious subjects .

It appears you are being deceptive on this issue .
The consortium report said Gore would have won only by diving votes like Carnac the Magnificent from dimpled , hanging , and swinging chads .
The problem is that the counting of such votes were not legal in the state of Florida .
The consortium reported that by any count of legal votes , Bush won Florida .
As a Florida resident and military member , I was one whom Gore attempted to disenfranchise by throwing out military votes in his quest to steal the Florida election .
Seems odd the Democrat mantra of " count every vote " has vanished at present , given they are attempting to disenfranchise two entire states in the primary .
Hillary should take the issue to the courts , since she has a much better case than Gore did in 2000 .

IT IS one of our most troubling national issues : the gap between the health of indigenous and non-indigenous Australians .
Now , after decades of debate on how to fix it , researchers have discovered a confronting reality  the gap is getting wider .
A snapshot of the nation 's health has revealed that while Australians overall now enjoy the second - highest life expectancy rates in the world , Aborigines remain mired in Third World rankings on almost every relevant measure of health .
This indigenous boy , born on Monday , can expect a life significantly worse than a white baby .
Credit : Glenn Campbell
The study by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare found that a baby born in Australian today can expect , on average , to live to 81.4 years  second only to Japan at 82.2 .
But it is a different story for indigenous babies , whose average life expectancy is only about 64 , or 17 years less than their non-indigenous counterparts .
ID Checks are About Control , Not Security
If there was ever any doubt that ID checks at airports are about control and not security , the Transportation Security Administration is clearing that up .
Starting June 21 , it says , “ passengers that willfully refuse to provide identification at security checkpoint [ sic ] will be denied access to the secure area of airports . ”
The claim is that this initiative is “ the latest in a series designed to facilitate travel for legitimate passengers while enhancing the agency ’s risk - based focus – on people , not things . ”
So let ’s take a moment to look at how refusing airport access to the willful enhances security .
. . . OK !
We ’re done !
No terrorist or criminal would draw attention to him or herself by obstinately refusing an ID check .
This is only done by the small coterie of civil libertarians and security experts who ca n’t stand the security pantomime that is airport identification checking .
The rest of the people traveling without ID have lost theirs – and TSA officials at airports have no way of knowing which is which .
This new rule will do nothing to improve airport security , but watch for the incident when a TSA agent “ does n’t believe ” someone who has truly lost his or her driver ’s license and tries to strand a traveler in a faraway city .

“ Not surprisingly , the engineer of the worst foreign policy in our nation ’s history has fired yet another reckless and reprehensible round .
More than seven years into his Presidency and in the sixth year of the directionless Iraq war , President Bush has yet to learn that his brand of divisive partisan rhetoric is precisely what has made America and our allies less secure , ” Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - NV ) said .
Reid called Bush out on the hypocrisy of his words versus his administration ’s actions , “ President Bush ’s own actions demonstrate that he believes negotiations – at the right moment , under the right conditions and with the right leaders – can both show strength and produce results .
He has relied on negotiations with North Korea and Libya , two state sponsors of terror . ”
He continued , “ And by conducting discussions with Russia , China , Libya , North Korea and Iran in recent years , President Bush has demonstrated his belief that negotiations can be a tool to advance America and Israel ’s national security interests .
I call on the President to explain the inconsistency between his Administration ’s actions and his words today . ”
Advertisements
President Bush ’s tough talk non-diplomacy almost led to the largest spread of nuclear weapons and technology since the end of the Cold War .
Talking tough is not the same as having a clue about foreign policy .
President Bush has lost credibility on almost every issue , but none more so , than on foreign policy .
If Bush is against any foreign policy strategy then it is a pretty safe bet that it is the right way to go .
Have n’t we had enough blood spilled by this administration ?
Do we really need to elect a Bush clone ?
The truth is that Barack Obama could n’t possibly do more damage to this nation than Bush has done .
It ’s interesting that George W. Bush has done more to unify the Democratic Party today , than either of the Party ’s two remaining presidential candidates .

Though a noble and nominally a clergyman , Bishop Charles Maurice de Talleyrand sided with the revolutionaries at the start of his long political career .
Better known for his diplomatic success at the Congress of Vienna in 1815 , it was he who proposed the metric system to France 's National Assembly .
Courtesy Chateau de Rochecotte __1790 : __The French National Assembly decides to create a decimal system of measurement .
The metric system is born .
This came after the storming of the Bastille but still before the declaration of a republic and the execution of King Louis XVI .
But revolution was in the air : " National Assembly " was simply the new name the upstart Third Estate had given itself .
The assembly was acting on a motion by Bishop Charles Maurice de Talleyrand .
Under the ancien régime , France measured with an inch , foot and fathom ( pouce , pied and toise ) about 6.6 percent larger than their English counterparts .
The first meter was based on clockmaking : the length of a pendulum with a half - period ( a one - way swing ) of one second .
Responding to a proposal by the French Academy of Sciences , the assembly redefined the meter in 1793 as 1/10,000,00011 of the distance from the Equator to the North Pole .
The system was elegant .
All conversions were based on 10 , with Greek prefixes ( deka- , hecto- , kilo - ) for multiples and Latin ( deci - , centi- , milli - ) for fractions .
The gram unit of weight was defined by the weight of one cubic centimeter ( aka milliliter ) of water .
The new " Republican Measures " became legal throughout France in 1795 and were made compulsory in 1799 when definitive platinum meter bars and kilogram weights were constructed .
But resistance to the new measures lasted for decades .
France also used a quasi-metric Revolutionary Calendar with each month consisting of three décades of 10 days each .
( Revolutionaries even attempted a metric day of 10 hours of 100 minutes each of 100 seconds each . )
But Napoleon returned France to the Gregorian calendar in 1806 .
The current International System of Units – or SI , for Système International – is based on the Treaty of the Meter signed in Paris on May 20 , 1875 .
The United States was a signatory , and the metric system is the legal system in this country , although the legal alternate English system remains more widely used .
( An online conversion engine can make translation easy . )
The meter was formally redefined in 1960 as 1,650,763.73 wavelengths in a vacuum of the orange - red light radiation of the krypton 86 atom ( transition between levels 2p10 and 5d5 ) .
The new standard was 100 times more precise than the old .
The current definition , adopted in 1983 , makes the meter the distance traveled by light in a vacuum during 1/299,792,458 of a second .
That 's 39.37 inches to counter - revolutionaries .

Some say that the government and the media are partners in a vast conspiracy , with a goal of making you so afraid that you 'll submit to their every desire .
And , well - that sounds about right .
Whether it's the threat of a terrorist attack , a shady foreign dictator , or men putting their genitals into other men , the powers that be want to keep you afraid of things you simply should n't be afraid of .
Here are the six most unwarranted sources of fear the Man uses to keep you dumb " ÃÂ ÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ ¦ and Himself in power .
1 AL QAEDA IN IRAQ

The Hype
The various clowns helming the Bush administration have touted the importance of confronting an Iraqi Al Qaeda group since the run-up to the war ( when Al Qaeda had less to do with Iraq than John Goodman does with the Tour de France ) .
The uber - feminine Senator Lindsay Graham ( R - SC ) , for example , claimed in a recent press release that US forces are " making great progress in crushing Al Qaeda in Iraq , " and that " The defeat of Al Qaeda in Iraq should be our No. 1 priority . "
Why You Should Blow It Off
Underground newsletter TIME magazine reports that Al Qaeda in Iraq " comprises no more than five percent of the insurgency , according to US intelligence estimates . "
No wonder things are going so laughably bad - if " Girl Name " Graham is right , our No. 1 priority comprises only five percent of the bad guys .
That 'd be like the A - Team fighting a group of 20 kidnappers ( they always do ) , but they all just beat the shit out of one dude .

For years , Kevin Jensen carried a pistol everywhere he went , tucked in a shoulder holster beneath his clothes .
In hot weather the holster was almost unbearable .
Pressed against Jensen ’s skin , the firearm was heavy and uncomfortable .
Hiding the weapon made him feel like a criminal .
Then one evening he stumbled across a site that urged gun owners to do something revolutionary : Carry your gun openly for the world to see as you go about your business .
In most states there ’s no law against that .
Advertisement
Jensen thought about it and decided to give it a try .
A couple of days later , his gun was visible , hanging from a black holster strapped around his hip as he walked into a Costco .
His heart raced as he ordered a Polish dog at the counter .
No one called the police .
No one stopped him .
Now Jensen carries his Glock 23 openly into his bank , restaurants and shopping centers .
He wore the gun to a Ron Paul rally .
He and his wife , Clachelle , drop off their 5 - year - old daughter at elementary school with pistols hanging from their hip holsters , and have never received a complaint or a wary look .
Jensen said he tries not to flaunt his gun .
“ We do n’t want to show up and say , ‘ Hey , we ’re here , we ’re armed , get used to it , ’ ” he said .
But he and others who publicly display their guns have a common purpose .
Advertisement
The Jensens are part of a fledgling movement to make a firearm as common an accessory as an iPod.
Called “ open carry ” by its supporters , the movement has attracted grandparents , graduate students and lifelong gun enthusiasts like the Jensens .
“ What we ’re trying to say is , ‘ Hey , we ’re normal people who carry guns , ’ ” said Travis Deveraux , 36 , of West Valley , a Salt Lake City suburb .
Deveraux works for a credit card company and sometimes walks around town wearing a cowboy hat and packing a pistol in plain sight .
“ We want the public to understand it ’s not just cops who can carry guns . ”
Police acknowledge the practice is legal , but some say it makes their lives tougher .
Police Chief John Greiner recalled that last year in Ogden , Utah , a man was openly carrying a shotgun on the street .
When officers pulled up to ask him about the gun , he started firing .
Police killed the man .
Advertisement
Greiner tells the story as a lesson for gun owners .
“ We ’ve changed over the last 200 years from the days of the wild , wild West , ” Greiner said .
“ Most people do n’t openly carry .
. . .
If [ people ] truly want to open carry , they ought to expect they ’ll be challenged more until people become comfortable with it . ”
Jensen and others argue that police should n’t judge the gun , but rather the actions of the person carrying it .
Jensen , 28 , is n’t opposed to attention , however .
It ’s part of the reason he brought his gun out in the open .
“ At first , [ open carry ] was a little novelty , ” he said .
“ Then I realized the chances of me educating someone are bigger than ever using it [ the gun ] in self - defense .
If it ’s in my pants or under my shirt I ’m probably not going to do anything with it . ”
As Clachelle pushed the shopping cart holding their two young children during a recent trip to Costco , her husband admired the new holster wrapped around her waist .
“ I like the look of that low - rise gun belt , ” he said .
Advertisement
The Jensens ’ pistols were snapped into holsters attached to black belts that hug their waists .
Guns are a fact of life in their household .
Their 5 - year - old daughter , Sierra , has a child - sized .22 rifle she handles only in her parents ’ presence .
Clachelle is the daughter of a Central California police chief and began shooting when she was about Sierra ’s age .
She would take her parents ’ gun when she went out and hide it in her purse because the firearm made her feel safer .
“ I love ‘em , ” Clachelle said .
“ I would n’t ever be without them . ”
Kevin Jensen ’s first encounter with guns came when he was 11 : His grandfather died and left him a 16 - gauge shotgun .
The gun stayed locked away but fascinated Jensen through his teen years .
He convinced his older brother to take him shooting in the countryside near their home in a small town south of Salt Lake City .
Advertisement
“ I immediately fell in love with it , ” said Jensen , a lean man with close - cropped hair and a precise gait that is a reminder of his five years in the Army Reserve .
“ I like things that go boom . ”
Jensen kept as many as 10 guns in the couple ’s 1930s - style bungalow in Santaquin , 21 miles southwest of Provo .
In January 2005 , he decided to get a permit to carry a concealed weapon , mainly for self - defense .
“ I ’m not going to hide in the corner of a school and mall and wait for the shooting to stop , ” he said .
When Jensen bought a Glock and the dealer threw in an external hip holster , he began researching the idea of carrying the gun in public and came upon OpenCarry.org .
Advertisement
Its website , run by two Virginia gun enthusiasts , claims 4,000 members nationwide .
It summarizes the varying laws in each state that permit or forbid the practice .
People everywhere have the right to prohibit weapons from their property , and firearms are often banned in government buildings such as courthouses .
According to an analysis by Legal Community Against Violence , a gun control group in San Francisco that tracks gun laws , at least eight states largely ban the practice , including Iowa and New Jersey .
Those that allow it have different restrictions :
In California , people can openly carry only unloaded guns .
Utah has no law prohibiting anyone from carrying a gun in public , as long as it is two steps from firing -- for example , the weapon may have a loaded clip but must be uncocked , with no bullets in the chamber .
Those who obtain a concealed - weapons permit in Utah do n’t have that restriction .
Also , youths under 18 can carry a gun openly with parental approval and a supervising adult in close proximity .
Most of the time people do n’t notice Jensen ’s gun .
That ’s not uncommon , said John Pierce , a law student and computer consultant in Virginia who is a co-founder of OpenCarry.org .
Advertisement
“ People are carrying pagers , BlackBerrys , cellphones , ” Pierce said .
“ They see a black lump on your belt and their eyes slide off . ”
Sometimes the reactions are comical .
Bill
White , a 24 - year - old graduate student in ancient languages at the University of Colorado at Boulder , wears his Colt pistol out in the open when he goes to his local Starbucks .
Earlier this month a tourist from California spotted him and snapped a photo on his cellphone .
“ He said it would prove he was in the Wild West , ” White recalled .
But there are times when the response is more severe .
Deveraux has been stopped several times by police , most memorably in December when he was walking around his neighborhood .
Advertisement
An officer pulled up and pointed his gun at Deveraux , warning he would shoot to kill .
In the end , eight officers arrived , cuffed Deveraux and took his gun before Deveraux convinced them they had no legal reason to detain him .
Deveraux saw the incident as not giving ground on his rights .
“ I ’m proud that happened , ” he said .
Cases like this are talked about during regular gatherings of those who favor open carry .
At a Sweet Tomatoes restaurant in the Salt Lake City suburb of Sandy , more than 40 civilians with guns strapped to their hips took over a corner of the restaurant , eating pasta and boisterously sharing stories .
Hassles with law enforcement were a badge of honor for some .

Travis
White , 19 , who has ear and chin piercings , congratulated Brandon Trask , 21 , on carrying openly for the first time that night .
“ Just wait until you get confronted by a cop , ” White said .
“ It ’ll make you feel brave . ”
Having pistols strapped around their waists made Shel Anderson , 67 , and his wife , Kaye , 63 , feel more secure .
Longtime recreational shooters , they began to carry their pistols openly after a spate of home - invasion robberies in their neighborhood .
The firearms can serve as a warning to predators , they said .
“ I decided I want to have as much of an advantage as I can have in this day and age , ” said Kaye Anderson , a retired schoolteacher .
Nearby , Scott Thompson picked over the remains of a salad , his Springfield Armory XD - 35 sitting snugly in his hip holster .
Advertisement
The gangly graphics designer grew up in a home without guns and did n’t think of owning one until he started dating a woman -- now his wife -- who lived in a rough neighborhood .
One night last year , a youth had his head beaten in with a pipe outside her bedroom window .
The next day , Thompson got a concealed - weapons permit .
Thompson found out about open carry last month while reading gun sites .
He ’s become a convert .
He likes the statement it makes .
Glancing around the restaurant , as armed families like the Jensens dined with men in cowboy hats and professionals like himself , Thompson smiled .
“ I love this , ” he said .
“ I want people to be aware that crazy people are not the only ones with guns .
Normal people carry them . ”
Advertisement
The Jensens ’ daughter , Sierra , and newborn son , Tyler , began to get restless , so the couple bundled up the children and pulled the manager of the restaurant aside to thank her for hosting them .
A patron appeared at Jensen ’s side and began to berate him .
“ What you guys are doing here is completely unacceptable , ” he said .
“ There are children here . ”
Jensen said that everyone in the restaurant had a legal right to carry .
The man did n’t back down and the Jensens left .
Days later , Jensen was still thinking about the reaction and the man ’s belief that guns are unsafe .
Advertisement
“ People can feel that way and it does n’t bother me , ” he said .
“ If they have irrational fears , that ’s fine . ”

Stroustrup によるプログラミング初学者向け の 「 Programming -- Principles and Practice Using C++」が 8 月に出版されるようです。
http://www.research.att.com/~bs/programming.html
Preface のドラフトが公開されていますが、じんわりと胸が熱くなるようなとてもいい内容です。
http://www.research.att.com/~bs/programming_pref.pdf
とは言え、この本は読者を選びます。ちょっと長いですが、その下りを引用します。
If your desire is to use the work of others without understanding how things are done and
without adding significantly to the code yourself , this book is not for you .
If so , please
consider if you would be better served by another book and another language .
If that is
approximately your view of programming , please also consider from where you got that
view and whether it in fact is adequate for your needs .
People often underestimate the
complexity of programming and well as its value .
I would hate for you to acquire a
dislike for programming because of a mismatch between what you needed and the part of
the software reality we describe .
There are many parts of the “ Information Technology ”
world that do not require knowledge of programming .
This book is aimed to serve those
who do want to write nontrivial programs .

Well , if you were on your first vacation in years , and an enchanted sword asked you to go find his magikal friends , would n't you take him up on it ?
Especially if there was money involved ?
Aahz takes Ersatz , leader of the Golden Hoard , on a treasure hunt to locate the other members of the group , to save them from being - - collected .
The two of them run into Tananda and her new friend , Calypsa , who are the ones doing the collecting , but it 's all for a good cause .
The trouble is , the treasures of the Hoard do n't really like one another , and that dislike has major magikal consequences .
Aahz has to organize everyone to help save Calypsa 's grandfather , the great dancer Calypso , from the evil wizard Barrik .
To protect humanity , we would have to launch a battle for freedom from science .
Saying that one has purely scientific thinking is tantamount to saying that one is a religious fanatic .
Today , when science is turning into a religion , we would have to skeptical of its claims of building a better world .
We all need to reflect that when debates and discussions were being barred in the name of COVID ; when crores of people were being pushed into hunger , unemployment and misery in the name of expert advice and science ; at that time , what was our duty ?
Did we do our duty ?
There is still time .
Do we intend to fulfil our responsibility ; do we want to discharge our duty ?

Some cities with long - established public transit systems , like New York and Boston , have seen increases in ridership of 5 percent or more so far this year .
But the biggest surges  of 10 to 15 percent or more over last year  are occurring in many metropolitan areas in the South and West where the driving culture is strongest and bus and rail lines are more limited .
Here in Denver , for example , ridership was up 8 percent in the first three months of the year compared with last year , despite a fare increase in January and a slowing economy , which usually means fewer commuters .
Several routes on the system have reached capacity , particularly at rush hour , for the first time .
“ We are at a tipping point , ” said Clarence W. Marsella , chief executive of the Denver Regional Transportation District , referring to gasoline prices .
Transit systems in metropolitan areas like Minneapolis , Seattle , Dallas - Fort Worth and San Francisco reported similar jumps .
In cities like Houston , Nashville , Salt Lake City , and Charlotte , N.C. , commuters in growing numbers are taking advantage of new bus and train lines built or expanded in the last few years .
The American Public Transportation Association reports that localities with fewer than 100,000 people have also experienced large increases in bus ridership .

In New York , the Metropolitan Transportation Authority reports that ridership was up the first three months of the year by more than 5 percent on the Long Island Rail Road and the Metro - North Railroad , while M.T.A. bus ridership was up 2.3 percent .
New York City subway use was up 6.8 percent for January and February .
Ridership on New Jersey Transit trains was up more than 5 percent for the first three months of the year .
A lot of concerned people emailed me to say that we MUST be running out of energy , because so many authoritative - looking people say so on TV .
Here ’s the result of ten minutes of Googling ( it will take longer if you beer - Google ) on " World Energy Reserves " :
Conventional fossil fuels ( from British Petroleum , " reserves available at existing economic and operational conditions , " i.e. not oil shales or other more expensive petroleum ores ) :
Oil : 161.9 billion tonnes ( annual use 3.8 billion tonnes )
Natural Gas : 179.5 trillion cubic meters ( annual use 2.7 trillion cubic meters )
Coal : 909 billion tonnes ( annual use 2.8 billion tonnes )
Nuclear fission ( from DOE estimates ) :
Uranium : ~ 11.5 million tonnes
Thorium : ~34.5 million tonnes
One metric ton ( tonne ) of uranium completely fissioned equals approximately 2 million tonnes of oil .
So our 46 million tonnes of currently available nuclear fuel is roughly equal to 92 trillion tonnes of oil , or 24,000 years of world oil usage .
( Or perhaps “ hydrogen usage ” , or “ beamed - energy usage ” would be more accurate ; while nuclear energy could be used to make gasoline out of coal or oil shale , if we do it for a thousand years we shall find ourselves running low on oxygen ! )
These are just the reserves available with our current technology at our current prices ( actually , with 1970s technology … the US has n’t started construction of any reactors since 1978 ) .
It does assume that we actually recycle the nuclear fuel efficiently , instead of continuing Jimmy Carter ’s policy of forcing the power companies to declare the uranium and plutonium in fuel rods to be " waste . "
Currently , US nuclear power plants are forced to operate at 0.5 % fuel efficiency , and do not breed more fuel out of thorium .
Then the enforced inefficiency ( and potential danger , from piles of unrecycled fuel ) is used to justify the 12 - billion - dollar boondoggle called Yucca Mountain .
It is just possible that nuclear power might get a teensy bit cheaper as time went on if some of the plants were allowed to be 150 % efficient 21st - century fast - neutron breeders instead of 0.5 % efficient 1970s relics .
It is also possible that electric power might be cheaper if it were produced by competing free - market companies instead of government - granted monopolies .
Of course this would lead to the inherent problems of unrestricted capitalism .
For instance , if there had been competing electric companies in New Orleans during Katrina , it would have caused terrible inequalities .
Not everyone ’s power would have gone off and stayed off for months ( in fact no one ’s power would have stayed off for months , because they would have switched companies ) .
The same would be true in wartime or other emergency ; the inefficient duplications of capitalism would mean that not all power would be knocked out in a city at the same time .
Unthinkable , of course ( though in the early days of electric power , there were no monopolies , and users often owned the wires and bought power from competing power plants … ) .
Fusion : ah , now the concerned emails start flowing in earnest .
" We do n’t know how to use fusion , and it ’s impossible for mere humans to invent a way . "
Wrong .
There is already an operational fusion reactor powering the global economy , and it produces 28 trillion times more raw energy than all man-made energy sources combined .
So even if some future " UN NRC " forever bans the helium - 3 + deuterium reactor , we can still expand our energy use by a factor of 28 trillion , and maintain it for the next five billion years or so .
Yes , it would be incredibly inefficient compared to artificial fusion reactors , but using 1960s nuclear rocket technology we could surround the Sun with orbiting solar collectors by the time we run out of uranium on the Earth ( there ’s the small problem of finding enough silicon for the solar cells , but the fusion reactors can make it out of Jupiter ’s hydrogen … oh , right , we ’re pretending that fusion ca n’t be done .
We would have to settle for a few million times the present world energy output if we restrict ourselves to using the asteroid belt and minor planets .
But only if the " Leif Erickson gene " is lost and we never leave this particular natural fusion reactor to visit others … ) .
Even today a few percent of the world ’s electric power comes from the sun ’s fusion energy , at such sites as Three Gorges Dam and European windmill farms .
And much as I love to tease solar cell enthusiasts ( especially at night ) , solar cells get better almost as fast as computers .
They ’ll be ready for prime time by the time we have to use the monoliths to make the silicon out of Jupiter …
There are already thousands of cost - effective , mass - produced man-made fusion reactors as well ; they are fueled by lithium deuteride .
Unfortunately , they are all owned by governments ( or perhaps government - funded " terrorist groups " ) , and they are sitting on top of missiles or in bombers , waiting to slaughter millions of people apiece at the whim of various politicians .
But these fusion reactors ( popularly know as " H - bombs " ) are not intrinsically evil .
While they are not suited to steady production of electric power , they can be used for many valuable , even life - saving industrial purposes .
One of the essential requirements for successful environmental stewardship is to keep the ecology from being blown up by asteroid impacts .
The existing 25 - megaton city - killers would be quite suitable for deflecting extinction asteroids .
They would also be useful for forcing asteroids and comets to hit the CO2 polar caps of Mars and induce Global Warming there .
If all the CO2 polar caps on Mars were sublimated , the little planet would have an atmosphere half as thick as Earth’s .
That ’s plenty good for green plants ( which will quickly convert much of the CO2 to oxygen , of course ) , so you Luddites who do n’t think that anyone can invent a fusion reactor will have somewhere to build your log cabins and plow behind your genetically - altered Mars Mules .
( The Earth will long have been 99 % powered by He - 3 fusion reactors , so you ’ll have to move to maintain your belief system . )
But enough " no-technological - progress - ever " nonsense .
The fact is that the world is full of young engineers , and new energy sources are being constructed all the time .
The Russians are using new fuel designs to beat their nuclear swords into economic plowshares ( and breed fuel out of abundant thorium at the same time ) .
The Chinese , Indians , Koreans , Japanese , etc. etc. are all into improved nuclear power technologies .
Almost the only nations not likely to build new - technology nuclear plants on a large scale are the US foreign - aid dictatorships in Africa , and the US itself .
Even oil - rich Iran is moving into nuclear energy as fast as it can .
The US political class can ( and does ) make energy vastly more expensive for Americans .
They can invade oil - producing nations like Iraq and shut down their oil industry .
They can ( and have ) prevent Americans from building any new oil refineries or nuclear reactors for decades .
But they ca n’t alter the geology of the Earth , or the laws of physics , and they ca n’t stop people in rogue states that really do have WMDs from doing anything they damn well please .
A quick look at the world ’s nuclear research programs shows that there are many nations that have breeder reactor technology in commercial prototypes already … and several of these countries are fresh out of socialist economic nonexistence .
A few more years of even the most tainted capitalism , and they ’ll have nuclear reactors that are at least 60 - 70 % fuel - efficient , compared with our 0.5 % " Jimmy Carter Specials . "
The nations that want energy will get energy , whether the US political class approves or not .
This all assumes , too , that no one ever invents any new energy sources .
This assumes that we know everything about Physics , mining technology , transportation systems , nuclear reactor design , etc .
After all , we ’ve had nuclear power for … less than a human lifetime .
Surely we know everything by now , right ?
The truth is that Googling ca n’t find most " World Energy Reserves . "
Energy reserves are created by human minds out of the raw materials of nature .
Most of these reserves will be the creations of the minds of people that are n’t even born yet .
All we can do on Google is find out the rock - bottom LOWER limit for our energy reserves .
The lower limit is enough to build interstellar civilizations and go on to find the " World Energy Reserves " of the Milky Way .
I wonder where the real upper limit is ?
The Best of Bill Walker
The mind of David Ray Griffin is refreshingly clear and logical .
With his exceptional gift for discerning significant distinctions he has , once again , produced a meticulous critical analysis of documentary evidence that is astute and compelling .
In " 9/11 Contradictions : An Open Letter to Congress and the Press , "
Dr. Griffin presents a sequence of irrefutable facts drawn from documents and testimony that demonstrate twenty five internal contradictions in the official 9/11 story .
As each contradiction is presented , the author juxtaposes documented timelines and official memos , eye - witness testimony , television broadcasts and news articles that are logically inconsistent with the narrative contrived by the 9/11 Commission .
Griffin objectively questions these contradictory narratives , some of them inherent within individual alibis , and observes that the Commission avoided confronting these inconsistencies by eliminating all mention of them in its report .
Facts that could not be logically refuted were strategically omitted , thereby erasing from the historical record all evidence of possible perjury and complicity .
Each chapter is devoted to one category of contradictions and ends with the request that Congress and the press investigate this inconsistency .
One of the most fascinating contradictions involves the whereabouts of principals on the morning of 9/11 during the critical hours between 9:00 - 10:00 am .
Public and internal records suggest that the timeline of events was adjusted by the Commission to place the principals at their command posts too late to protect the nation , too late to orchestrate a military response , too late to give stand - down orders , too late to give shootdown orders or to be otherwise guilty of collusion .
The conflicting testimony of eye - witnesses such as Richard Clarke , Norman Mineta and FAA officials , who placed the principals and military liaisons at their command posts well before the Commission 's timeline did , was simply omitted from the 9/11 Commission Report .
The Commission 's systematic timeline alteration and omission of incriminating evidence thereby suggest that its mission was damage control , a deliberate cover - up of government complicity in the crime .
Griffin , however , does not make this charge ; he simply presents the contradictions .
The Commission claimed that Vice President Cheney did not arrive in the Presidential Emergency Operations Center until 9:58 .
That claim was contradicted by the testimony of Norman Mineta , Secretary of Transportation , who arrived at the PEOC around 9:20 where shortly thereafter he witnessed Cheney confirm an order that is most logically interpreted as an order not to shoot down an incoming object shortly before the Pentagon was struck .
Richard Clarke 's account in his book , " Against All Enemies , " corroborates Mineta 's timeline , which was evidently so threatening to the official story that Mineta 's testimony was deleted from the 9/11 Commission video archives .
General Richard Myers contradicted his own story in several incarnations of his alibi as did Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , both of whom claimed to be unaware of unfolding events when , according to Richard Clarke , they were both participating in a live video teleconference initiated by Clarke at about 9:10 .
Griffin skillfully analyzes these contradictory versions of events .
The Commission 's claim that the FAA did not notify the military early enough to scramble jets was contradicted by the FAA 's assertion that not only was a military liaison present throughout its nationwide alert but " within minutes after the first aircraft hit the World Trade Center it immediately established several phone bridges that included .
DOD , the Secret Service , and other government agencies . "
NORAD 's original ( September 18 , 2001 ) timeline corroborated FAA statements as did military officers , such as the National Military Command Center 's Brigadier General Montague Winfield and NORAD 's Captain Michael Jellinek .
One also learns from Richard Clarke that the " Secret Service had a system that allowed them to see what FAA 's radar was seeing . "
The 9/11 Commission 's claim , therefore , would be laughable had the consequences of this lie not been so tragic .
Griffin presents extensive eye - witness accounts by firefighters , police officers , journalists and building workers who gave vivid reports of hearing and seeing powerful sequential explosions within all three of the World Trade Center skyscrapers prior to their collapse .
Building 7 , which was not hit by a plane , also collapsed symmetrically into its own footprint around 5:20 pm - an event that was anticipated and communicated to firefighters by Mayor Giuliani 's Office of Emergency Management around noon .
Griffin poses the question to NIST , the agency tasked by the Commission with explaining the destruction of the Twin Towers and WTC7 , how OEM could have known so many hours in advance that the building would collapse .
Further evidence of controlled demolition is suggested by three professors at Worcester Polytechnic Institute who noted the peculiar characteristics of oxidation and sulfidation on salvaged WTC steel beams .
NIST admitted that the temperature of the fires was insufficient ( by at least 1000 °F ) to melt steel .
However , if thermate cutter charges ( thermite plus sulfur ) were used to slice the steel framework , that would explain the molten steel .
How did NIST and the 9/11 Commission explain the eyewitness testimony that steel had melted ?
By not mentioning it .
Several chapters are devoted to exposing contradictions concerning the alleged hijackers .
The assertion that Hani Hanjour could have flown American Airlines Flight 77 into the Pentagon after making a spectacular 330° turn over prohibited airspace is demonstrably preposterous given his record of total incompetence as a pilot .
The profile of Mohamed Atta as a devout Muslim on a sacred suicide mission is contradicted by numerous eye - witnesses who described his unholy lifestyle in vivid detail .
The FBI 's assertion that Atta 's personal belongings provided a treasure trove of incriminating evidence ( a Koran , his Will and a list of the 19 hijackers ) is dubious , given the FBI 's inconsistent versions of where this miraculous proof was found .
It was first reportedly found in a white Mitsubishi at Logan airport in Boston .
That story was changed when a subsequent tale proved to be false .
After the FBI claimed that two hijackers named Bukhari had driven a blue Nissan to Portland , Maine , and then taken a commuter flight back to Boston on the morning of 9/11 , it was discovered that one Bukhari had died the previous year and the other was still alive .
The FBI clumsily merged these stories by claiming that Atta drove the blue Nissan to Portland and then took the commuter flight back .
In this new story , the incriminating evidence was " found " in his luggage , which failed to get transferred to Flight 11 .
The public belief that Middle Eastern men hijacked the planes was based heavily on media reports of over 15 cell phone calls from passengers to relatives , although high - altitude cell phone calls were not possible in 2001 .
One source of the hijacker tale came from the Justice Department 's Solicitor General , Ted Olson , who told CNN that his wife ( Barbara ) had called him twice from American Flight 77 .
That claim was contradicted at the Zacarias Moussaoui trial in 2006 when the FBI reported that only two cell phone calls were made from all four planes , and that both calls originated from United Flight 93 ( after it had descended to 5,000 feet ) .
How did the Commission reconcile FBI records with reports from family members who recognized Caller IDs made from cell phones ?
It omitted the FBI records .
Why do these contradictions matter ?
The story of al - Qaeda , Osama bin Laden and nineteen Muslim hijackers is based entirely on unverified claims .
Despite promises of forthcoming evidence , the US government has yet to deliver any hard evidence .
To this day , the FBI 's web page concerning Osama bin Laden does not accuse him of involvement with the 9/11 attacks .
Why not ?
An FBI official has admitted , " The FBI has no hard evidence connecting Bin Laden to 9/11 . "
What , then , is the justification for attacking two sovereign nations and killing over one million civilians ?
Although Griffin refrains from making direct accusations , he methodically presents objective evidence that leads the reader to an inevitable conclusion ~ that the purpose of the 9/11 Commission was to assign guilt where it did not exist and to cover up guilt where it did , thereby obstructing criminal indictments for treason , mass murder , war crimes , crimes against humanity and crimes against the earth .
Griffin's impeccable research should inspire public demand for an independent investigation of 9/11 .
The enormous public service Griffin has provided in preparing this meticulous archive cannot be over - stated .
Any investigative journalist worthy of that title would need only to validate this archive of facts .
With the precision and skill of a seasoned District Attorney , David Ray Griffin presents a case that is so well organized it could be used intact by any prosecutor devoted to uncovering the truth .
Let the trials begin .
Indictments are long overdue .
WHEN Roland Fryer was about 15 , a friend asked him what he would be doing when he was 30 .
He said he would probably be dead .
It was a reasonable prediction .
At the time , he was hanging out with a gang and selling drugs on the side .
Young black men in that line of work seldom live long .
But Mr Fryer survived .
At 30 , he won tenure as an economics professor at Harvard .
That was four months ago .
Mr Fryer 's parents split up when he was very young .
His father was a maths teacher who went off the rails : young Roland once had to borrow money to bail him out of jail .
His great - aunt and great - uncle ran a crack business : young Roland would watch them cook cocaine powder into rocks of crack in a frying pan in the kitchen .
Several of his relatives went to prison .
But Mr Fryer backed away from a life of crime and won a sports scholarship to the University of Texas .
He found he enjoyed studying , and was rather good at it .
By the time he was 25 , the president of Harvard was hectoring him to join the faculty .
Mr Fryer now applies his supple mind to the touchy , tangled issue of racial inequality .
Why are African - Americans so much less prosperous than whites ?
Why do so many black children flounder in school ?
Why do so many young black men languish behind bars ?
Why are stories like Mr Fryer 's considered so surprising ?
Black and white Americans tend to produce different answers to these questions , and there is also heated disagreement within both groups .
Some blacks think their glass is three - quarters full ; others think it three - quarters empty .
Optimists can point to obvious improvements .
Little more than four decades ago , blacks in the South could not vote .
This year , a black man may be elected president .
Under segregation , southern blacks were barred from white schools , neighbourhoods and opportunities .
Now , racial discrimination is both illegal and taboo .
Blacks have pierced nearly every glass ceiling .
The secretary of state , the boss of American Express and the country 's most popular entertainer ( Oprah Winfrey ) are all black .
Life for the average African - American has also improved remarkably .
The median black household income has risen from $ 22,300 ( in 2006 dollars ) in 1967 to $ 32,100 in 2006 .
Black life expectancy has soared from 34 in 1900 to 73 today .
Most blacks today are middle class .
Yes , say the pessimists , but the gap between what blacks and whites earn and what they learn , which narrowed steadily between the 1940s and the late 1980s , has more or less frozen since then .
Blacks ' median household income is still only 63 % of whites ' .
Academically , black children at 17 perform no better than a white 13 - year - old .
Blacks die , on average , five years earlier than whites .
And though the black middle class has grown immensely , many blacks are still stuck in crime - scorched , nearly jobless ghettos .
What ails black America ?
Public debate falls between two poles .
Some academics and most civil - rights activists stress the role played by racial discrimination .
It may no longer be overt , they argue , but it is still widespread and severe .
Julian Bond of the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People reckons that racism is still “ epidemic ” in America .
Black conservatives , while never denying that racism persists , think it much less severe than before and no longer the main obstacle to black advancement .
Bill Cosby , a veteran comedian , tours the country urging blacks to concentrate on improving themselves : to study hard , to work hard and — especially — to shun the culture of despair that grips the ghetto .
The debate is often bitter .
Michael Eric Dyson , a leftish academic , argues that the black middle class has “ lost its mind ” if it believes Mr Cosby 's argument downplaying the importance of race .
Larry Elder , a conservative pundit , wrote a book about blacks who blame racism for nearly everything called : “ Stupid Black Men ” .
Mr Fryer eschews histrionics in favour of hard data .
He is obsessed with education , which he calls “ the civil - rights battleground of the 21st century ” .
Why do blacks lag behind whites in school ?
Mr Fryer is prepared to test even the most taboo proposition .
Are blacks genetically predisposed to be less intelligent than whites ?
With a collaborator from the University of Chicago , Mr Fryer debunked this idea .
Granted , blacks score worse than whites on intelligence tests .
But Mr Fryer looked at data from new tests on very young children .
At eight months to a year , he found almost no racial gap , and that gap disappeared entirely when he added controls for such things as low birth weight .
If the gap is absent in babies , this suggests it is caused by environmental factors , which can presumably be fixed .
But first they must be identified .
Do black children need better nutrition ?
More stimulation in the home ?
Better schools ?
Probably all these things matter , but how much ?
“ I do n't know , ” says Mr Fryer .
It is a phrase that , to his credit , he uses often .
Cool to be dumb
His most striking contribution to the debate so far has been to show that black students who study hard are accused of “ acting white ” and are ostracised by their peers .
Teachers have known this for years , at least anecdotally .
Mr Fryer found a way to measure it .
He looked at a large sample of public - school children who were asked to name their friends .
To correct for kids exaggerating their own popularity , he counted a friendship as real only if both parties named each other .
He found that for white pupils , the higher their grades , the more popular they were .
But blacks with good grades had fewer black friends than their mediocre peers .
In other words , studiousness is stigmatised among black schoolchildren .
It would be hard to imagine a more crippling cultural norm .
Mr Fryer has some novel ideas about fixing this state of affairs .
New York 's school system is letting him test a couple of them on its children .
One is to give pupils cash incentives .
If a nine - year - old completes an exam , he gets $ 5 .
For getting the answers right , he gets more money , up to about $ 250 a year .
The notion of bribing children to study makes many parents queasy .
Mr Fryer 's response is : let 's see if it works and drop it if it does n't .
Another idea , being tested on a different group of children , is to hand out free mobile telephones .
The phones do not work during school hours , and children can recharge them with call - minutes only by studying .
( The phone companies were happy to help with this . )
The phones give the children an incentive to study , and Mr Fryer a means to communicate with them .
He talks of “ re- branding ” academic achievement to make it cool .
He knows it will not be easy .
He recalls hearing drug- pushers in the 1980s joking “ Just say no ! ” as they handed over the goods , mocking Nancy Reagan 's anti-drug slogan .
Blacks who do well in school are hungrily recruited by universities , which often admit them with lower test scores than are required of whites or Asians .
The bar was first lowered for blacks out of a sense that America owes them a debt for past discrimination .
Now universities are more likely to argue that racial diversity is valuable for its own sake .
But racial preferences are unpopular among whites , and the most blatant ones are , increasingly , illegal .
The University of Michigan used to give applicants more points for being black than for getting a perfect score on the entrance exam .
The Supreme Court deemed this unconstitutional in 2003 , but ruled that less explicit preferences might be allowable .
When voters are asked if they want to ban racial preferences in the public sphere , they generally say yes .
Since the 1990s , three states have passed referendums barring racial preferences , and four more may do so in November .
Opponents of racial preferences argue that they are bad for blacks , too .
A study by Richard Sander of the University of California , Los Angeles , found that when the bar is lowered for black applicants to law school , they are admitted to institutions where they cannot cope .
Many who drop out of top - tier colleges might have thrived at slightly less competitive ones .
Mr Sander calculated that the net effect of pro-black preferences was actually to reduce the number of blacks who passed the bar exam .
That is , racial preferences for black law students result in fewer black lawyers .
John McWhorter , the author of “ Winning the Race : Beyond the Crisis in Black America ” , argues that lowering the bar for blacks also reduces their incentive to excel at school .
“ As long as black students have to do only so well , they will do only so well , ” he says .
For every dollar that a white man earns , a black man makes only 70 cents .
Such figures are sometimes bandied around to imply that nearly all of this gap is caused by discrimination .
That is bunk .
If a firm could really get the same work done 30 % more cheaply simply by hiring blacks , someone would have noticed and made a fortune doing just that .
That said , blacks certainly face barriers in the job market .
Two economists , Marianne Bertrand and Sendhil Mullainathan , sent out 5,000 replies to job advertisements in Boston and Chicago .
Each fictitious applicant was randomly assigned either a black - sounding name , such as Jamal or Lakisha , or a white one , such as Emily or Greg .
For every ten jobs the “ whites ” applied for , they were offered one interview .
The “ blacks ” had to post 15 letters to elicit the same response .
Clearly , some managers are racist .
But many are not .
And many firms are desperate to hire and promote blacks , if only to avoid lawsuits .
The short straw
Looked at more closely , the statistics are murky .
White men are more likely to work than black men .
The proportion of black men participating in the labour force fell from 74 % in 1972 to 67 % last year .
Whites start more businesses , too .
Only 5 % of firms are black - owned , though blacks account for 13 % of America 's population .
A black woman with a degree earns as much as a white woman with a degree .
But with a professional degree , the black woman earns 30 % more ( see chart 2 ) .
That does not prove that law firms discriminate in favour of black women — though they may .
Another explanation is that a skilled white woman is more likely to have a rich husband ( or indeed any husband ) , and so may have less incentive to maximise her earnings .
Even when blacks earn as much as whites , the whites are typically far wealthier .
In 2000 the average white household in the bottom fifth of income - earners had net assets of $ 24,000 .
The figure for blacks was a piffling $ 57 .
Whites in the middle fifth were five times wealthier than their black counterparts .
Partly this is because whites inherit more .
But it is also because of different approaches to investment .
Blacks are more likely to put their money in the bank , notes Mr Fryer .
Whites are more likely to invest in shares , which generate higher returns .
Compound this over a couple of generations and the effect is colossal .
Another crucial factor is the collapse of the black family .
The proportion of black babies born out of wedlock has nearly doubled since 1970 , to 69 % .
And 70 % of these births are to mothers who are truly alone , not cohabiting .
Stable two - parent families accumulate wealth more easily than single - parent homes .
Two salaries stretch further , two pairs of hands mean less need for paid child care .
Two - parent families also find it easier to raise well - adjusted , studious children , who go on to start stable families of their own .
Broken families , if middle class , find it harder to stay that way .
And if they start in the ghetto , they find it harder to break out .
“ Black life is not valued ! ” booms Michael Walrond , a popular pastor in Harlem .
He is referring to the news that three police officers were acquitted of all charges after shooting dead an unarmed black man , Sean Bell , a few hours before his wedding .
The cops fired 50 bullets , but the pastor says he is outraged by the figure of 31 .
Members of his mostly black flock know immediately what he means .
Two of the officers were black and all of them thought Mr Bell had a gun .
But it was the white officer who reloaded and fired 31 rounds .
Mr Walrond 's angry sermon draws cheers .
Afterwards , in his office , he agrees that it is not only whites who devalue black lives : black criminals do too .
Mr Walrond , like many inner-city clerics , works hard to reform those who stray .
But like Barack Obama 's former pastor , Jeremiah Wright , he tends to assume the worst about his country .
He finds Mr Wright 's theory that the government concocted the AIDS virus to kill blacks “ credible ” .
He refers to the Tuskegee experiment between 1932 and 1972 when some doctors in Alabama deliberately neglected to treat black syphilis patients in order to study the disease 's progression .
That was an abomination .
But it is hardly evidence that the government is bent on genocide .
From alienation to despair
Is the state racist ?
Those who think so often point to the criminal - justice system .
A startling 11 % of black males aged 20 - 34 are behind bars .
Overall , black men are seven times more likely to be incarcerated than white men .
Until recently , sentences for crack offenders ( who are mostly black ) were much harsher than those for powder - cocaine offenders ( mostly white ) .
Ex-convicts in several states are barred from voting , a penalty that deters no crime but signals to wrongdoers that they can never be full citizens again .
“ We are becoming a nation of jailers , and racist jailers at that , ” reckons Glenn Loury , an economist .
Not so , says Heather Mac Donald of the Manhattan Institute , a conservative think - tank .
Blacks are more likely to be jailed because they commit more crimes , she argues .
In 2005 the black murder rate was seven times higher than that for whites and Latinos combined .
Harsh crack laws account only for a smidgeon of the disparity in incarceration rates .
In 2006 blacks were 37.5 % of state prisoners ; exclude drug offenders and that figure drops to 37 % .
And since black criminals ' victims are mostly black , some argue that locking more of them up has saved many black lives .
In other ways , it is far from clear that the government is trying to keep blacks down .
Affirmative - action policies mean that it provides jobs for a disproportionate number of them .
It also allows blacks who own small businesses to charge 10 % more than whites and still win federal contracts .
“ Small ” is generously defined .
A firm with 1,500 employees can qualify .
Its black owner can be worth $ 750,000 — excluding his home and business — and still be deemed “ economically disadvantaged ” .
Yet many blacks feel alienated in a way that is “ vastly disproportionate to real - life stimulus , ” frets Mr McWhorter .
When New Orleans flooded , some speculated that the government had blown up the levees .
Even cooler heads believed that the botched response stemmed from George Bush 's indifference to black suffering .
Alienation has consequences .
Amid the revolutionary fervour of the 1960s , says Mr McWhorter , many blacks learned that “ America 's racism rendered it unworthy of any self - regarding black person 's embrace and that therefore blacks were exempt from mainstream standards of conduct . ”
The conventional wisdom about ghettos — best expressed in William Julius Wilson 's book “ When Work Disappears ” — is that inner cities decayed because factories moved away .
But the jobs often moved only a couple of bus rides away .
Noting that millions of blacks moved halfway across the country to find work during the “ great migration ” in the early 20th century , Mr McWhorter wonders why so many of their descendants failed to follow suit .
He offers two explanations .
First , a huge expansion of open - ended welfare in the 1960s enabled mothers to subsist without work .
Until the mid-1990s , welfare often paid better than an entry - level job .
Second , the counter - culture taught young blacks that working for “ chump change ” was beneath their dignity .
Bill Clinton fixed welfare and pushed millions of jobless women into work .
Violent crime has also fallen sharply since the 1990s , despite the best efforts of gangster rappers to glorify it .
Previously dysfunctional cities , such as New York and Washington , DC , are now soberly governed and better places to live in .
Yet many African - Americans are intensely gloomy .
In a poll last year , only 44 % said they expected life for blacks to get better , down from 57 % in 1986 .
The subprime mortgage crisis , which will cost many black families their homes this year , will surely deepen the gloom .
Some blacks contend that racism has simply gone underground .
Ellis Cose , a journalist , once wrote that even middle - class blacks suffer constant subtle racial slights , and that these are so distressing that they “ are in the end most of what life is ” .
Other blacks think he exaggerates .
Sometimes , says Mr McWhorter , the assistant trailing you in a store is just trying to sell you something .
If Barack Obama can only ...
Taking the longer view , there is much to cheer .
In every way that can be measured ( a big caveat ) , racism has diminished in the past two generations .
Inter - racial marriages are up sevenfold since 1970 .
Young Americans are far less likely to express racial animosity than their elders , suggesting that as old bigots die , they will not be replaced .
And if Mr Obama becomes president , it would “ raise the ceiling for everyone , ” says Robert Franklin , the president of Morehouse , a black college in Atlanta .
“ For me , racism is not going to be an obstacle , ” says DeWayne Powell , a student at Morehouse .
He recalls an incident when , en route to drop off his college application , he stopped to ask for directions .
A white receptionist asked sneeringly whether he could read .
“ I laughed , ” he says .
“ I thought : I 'm on my way to fulfil my destiny , and you 're stuck behind that glass . ”
The oil giant ExxonMobil has admitted that its support for lobby groups that question the science of climate change may have hindered action to tackle global warming .
In its corporate citizenship report , released last week , ExxonMobil says it intends to cut funds to several groups that " divert attention " from the need to find new sources of clean energy .
The move comes ahead of the firm 's annual meeting today in Dallas , at which prominent shareholders including the Rockefeller family will urge ExxonMobil to take the problem of climate change more seriously .
Green campaigners accuse the company of funding a " climate denial industry " over the last decade , with $ 23 m ( £ 11.5 m ) handed over to groups that play down the risks of burning fossil fuels .
The ExxonMobil report says : " In 2008 we will discontinue contributions to several public policy research groups whose position on climate change could divert attention from the important discussion on how the world will secure the energy required for economic growth in an environmentally responsible manner . "
Nine groups have reportedly lost the company 's support , including the George C Marshall Institute , the Washington DC - based think tank that asserts there is no scientific consensus on climate change , and that changes in the sun , not greenhouse gases , could be responsible for rising temperatures .
A survey carried out by the UK's Royal Society found that in 2005 ExxonMobil distributed $ 2.9 m to 39 groups that the society said " misrepresented the science of climate change by outright denial of the evidence " .
In 2006 the society wrote to the company to ask them to stop funding such groups .
Kert Davies of Greenpeace said : " The organisations eliminated in this latest rounds of cuts could be called the engine room of the climate sceptic industry , but if Rex Tillerson [ head of ExxonMobil ] is serious about his company shaking off this shameful legacy , he needs to make a wider sweep . "
Greenpeace says ExxonMobil continues to fund over " two dozen other organisations who question the science of global warming or attack policies to solve the crisis . "
Parents spending any part of the night with their infants report poor sleep
Parental adaptation to infant sleep was poorer when infants spent any part of the night with their parents , even when parents endorsed bedsharing , according to a research abstract that will be presented on Monday at SLEEP 2008 , the 22nd Annual Meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies ( APSS ) .
The study , authored by Molly Countermine , of Penn State University , focused on 45 families with infants between one and 24 months .
Parents completed measures of parental cognitions about infant sleep and attitudes and practices regarding sleep arrangements .
A measure of adaptation to infant sleep was derived from five items that inquired about parents ’ satisfaction with infants ’ sleep location , and bedtime and nighttime behavior .
The results showed that the adaptation scores of both fathers and mothers were highly correlated .
Parents whose infants spent any time with them at night had poorer adaptation scores that did parents who slept separately from their infants .
Parents with more lenient attitudes toward bedsharing spent more time with their infants at night than did parents with less lenient attitudes .
Interestingly , however , more lenient attitudes toward bedsharing were associated with poorer adaptation in both mothers and fathers .
“ In a culture that is typically not accustomed to co-sleeping , parents who choose to co-sleep for their child ’s well - being may be doing so at their own expense , ” said Countermine .
It is recommended that adults get seven to eight hours of nightly sleep , infants 14 - 15 hours and toddlers 12 - 14 hours .
The American Academy of Sleep Medicine ( AASM ) offers the following tips on how to get a good night ’s sleep :
Follow a consistent bedtime routine .
Establish a relaxing setting at bedtime .
Get a full night ’s sleep every night .
Avoid foods or drinks that contain caffeine , as well as any medicine that has a stimulant , prior to bedtime .
Do not bring your worries to bed with you .
Do not go to bed hungry , but do n’t eat a big meal before bedtime either .
Avoid any rigorous exercise within six hours of your bedtime .
Make your bedroom quiet , dark and a little bit cool .
Get up at the same time every morning .
Those who suspect that they might be suffering from a sleep disorder are encouraged to consult with their primary care physician or a sleep specialist .

Bandwidth caps are coming to Japan , but not in the way to which North Americans are accustomed .
OCN , operated by NTT Communications , has decided to impose a daily upload limit beginning on August 1 .
The limit ?
30 GB per day .
Upstream .
According to the company , the limit is being implemented to address a " small number " of users who apparently upload far more than that on a day - to - day basis by running servers for file - sharing .
Customers will get a warning upon first violation , NTT spokesperson Tei Gordon told IDG News Service today , but could be disconnected for repeat offenses .
Of course , NTT 's 100 M bps fiber - optic connections make it easy to use and abuse the service .
And — let 's be realistic — a 30 GB - per-day upload limit is plenty for even heavy P2P use .
That 's almost a terabyte per month of data , and those concerned over download caps should n't worry , though , as those will remain unlimited .
Download all the terabytes upon terabytes of data you want !
This kind of extremely generous usage cap is made possible because of Japan 's fiber - centric broadband infrastructure .
Here in the US , fiber installations are few and far between , leaving most of us with subpar speeds and service .
It 's a large reason why users who use even moderate levels of bandwidth will face very low usage caps .
For example , Time Warner recently announced that it would begin capping customers ' downloads in Beaumont , Texas at 40 GB per month for $ 55 .
Users will be billed $ 1 for each additional gigabyte downloaded .
At first glance , such usage caps might seem reasonable , but they 're not so attractive after you consider the growing number of important services we use that soak up lots of bandwidth .
The Internet is now used to distribute software , digital high - definition video , and music .
It also facilitates online gaming , video conferencing , real - time collaboration , interactive remote desktop access , file backups , and many other bandwidth - intensive activities .
Other companies are tossing around slightly more generous caps , like Comcast 's possible 250 GB per month limit .
As we noted in his analysis of Time Warner 's decision , however , ISPs who have ample bandwidth will be happy to take in customers who are n't interested in being metered .
And there are some intriguing wireless broadband options on the horizon that could draw customers away from bandwidth - constrained cable companies .
Chicago plans to join more than 20 other cities and shut off exterior lights on public buildings for an hour in an effort to raise environmental awareness .
The voluntary hour of energy conservation is to occur worldwide on March 29 from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. as part of Earth Hour 2008 , sponsored by the World Wildlife Fund , the Chicago Tribune reported Saturday .
It 's " a symbolic gesture to remind us that we all share the responsibility of global warming , " Chicago Mayor Richard Daley said Friday .
Exterior lights also will turn off for the hour on Chicago landmarks such as the Merchandise Mart , Sears Tower and the John Hancock Center , said a World Wildlife Fund statement .
Other participating cities include Toronto , Manila , Bangkok , Copenhagen , Melbourne and Tel Aviv .

Error code 0x800c0005 occurs in Windows after a native or third - party activity has failed after having trouble downloading files .
In most cases , this problem is related to an error with multiple Dynamic Link Library ( .DDL ) files .
However , the same error code is also reported on Xbox One .

Deactivate the Proxy via the Registry Editor
Open the registry editor and go to : HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software \Policies \Microsoft\Windows \CurrentVersion \Internet Settings
Create a new DWORD named EnableAutoproxyResultCache and set the data value to 0 to disable the automatic proxy caching .
Restart the PC .
Check your NAT Settings on Xbox One
The following error code appears when you try to play a song or video on the Xbox One console or the Xbox app :
0x800c0005
This may mean that the Internet connection between the console or Xbox device and the other service is failing .
This is often the result of incompatible NAT ( Network Address Translation ) types .
To solve this problem , we first check the current NAT type .
In order to do this :
Press the Xbox button to open the guide .
Select Profile and System > Settings > General > Network Settings .
In the current network status , the NAT type field shows your current NAT type .
The NAT type must be open to solve this problem .
You also want to make sure that no errors such as Double NAT or UPnP failed are detected .
Disable a Third - party Firewall
According to some interested users , this problem can also occur due to an overprotective AV suite that blocks the connection to the external server and generates the error code 0x8004005 .
If you are using a third - party suite , you should uninstall it before trying the currently flawed procedure and checking if that solves the problem .
Note that disabling real - time protection is probably not enough as the same security rules will remain in effect even if the primary AV service is disabled .

Scientists discover a new mathematical formula ... for the perfect cheese sandwich
Most of us are happy to slap two pieces of bread together with a few slices of cheddar and , if we 're lucky , a squirt of salad cream to make a good cheese sarnie .
But it seems the process may have just become a bit more complicated than that .
Not content with their usual figures and algebra , scientists have discovered a mathematical formula for creating the perfect cheese sandwich .
The volume of mayonnaise or pickle to calculate the ideal cheese thickness to go with the relish is essential , according to scientists
Sensory analysts at Bristol University have devised an equation into which diners follow factors such as how much mayonnaise or pickle to put in the sandwich and the ideal cheese thickness to go with the relish .
The formula , which includes nine algebraic variables , has been used to create an online calculator , which can be seen at www.cheddarometer.com.
The formula ( detailed below ) is the result of a study by senior research fellow Geoff Nute and his team at the university 's Sensory & Consumer Group in the Division of Farm Animal Science .
Using human assessors and complex measuring devices , the group claims to have ' mapped ' the flavour profile of hundreds of samples of Cheddar to determine the tastiest thickness for each type of filling .
West Country Farrmhouse Cheesemakers have come up with what they say is the mathematical formula for the perfect cheese sandwich
Mr Nute said : ' We used specially trained human taste testers to sample a range of Cheddar cheeses in a carefully controlled environment and combined results from these tests with instrumental data obtained using colorometers and pressure sensors to obtain precise measurements of variants such as yellowness , crumbliness , creaminess and tanginess .
' The results of our research have been extrapolated to produce a formula which takes into account modifying characteristics of individual cheeses and the ratio of popular fillings and achieves a mathematical balance of flavours in order to gauge the correct thickness of the Cheddar . '
The formula , which includes nine algebraic variables , has been used to create an online calculator
Philip Crawford , chairman of the West Country Farmhouse Cheesemakers group , said : ' We are very proud of our authentic farmhouse Cheddar which we make by hand on our farms using only milk from our own cows .
' This means each variety has a unique character and we were fascinated to know which combinations of sandwich fillings work best with each cheese .
' Collaborating with Mr Nute and his team we have managed to create the Cheddarometer and reveal the blueprint to everyone 's perfect cheese sandwich . '
Last year the collective turned a traditional round of Cheddar into an unlikely internet hit , when 1.8 million visitors looked at a webcam showing the cheese maturing in real time .
The formula :
W [ 1 + ( ( bd ) /6.5 ) ) - s + ( ( m - 2 c ) /2 ) + (( v+p )/7t ) ] ( 100 + l/100 )
W = the thickness of Cheddar in millimetres
B = The thickness of the bread
D = The dough flavour modifier
S = The thickness of margarine or butter
M = The thickness of mayonnaise
C = The creaminess modifier
V = The thickness of tomato
P = The depth of pickle
T = The tanginess modifier
I = The thickness of the lettuce layer

Remarkable images of the world 's rarest rhino species , the Javan rhino , have been caught on film .
A mother and her calf could be seen grazing in Ujung Kulon National Park in Java , Indonesia .
But when she spotted the hidden camera , she charged and sent it flying .
An entrepreneur , a doctor , and a team of researchers at MIT are trying to make surgery a less bloody proposition .
They say surgeons spend about half their time in the operating room trying to manage bleeding , using sponges , clamps , sutures , glues , and substances that promote clotting .
When those means fail , it 's usually curtains for the patient .
But getting the technology from the research lab into the operating room wo n't be a cinch for Arch Therapeutics Inc. , a Cambridge company formed two years ago to try to commercialize what seems like a breakthrough in blocking bleeding .
In April , Arch Therapeutics signed a deal to license the technology from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , and it is hoping to test it in larger animals later this year ( so far , it has only been tested on rodents ) .
The company has n't yet raised outside venture capital funding - though its founders say that 's all part of the plan .
An MIT researcher , Rutledge Ellis - Behnke , had a eureka moment in 2001 .
He was trying to develop a substance that would help foster the regeneration of damaged nerve tissue , using protein fragments known as peptides .
But during one surgical procedure , Ellis - Behnke noticed that the animal stopped bleeding after he applied the substance .
He and his colleagues assumed the animal died ; they were wrong .
They soon realized that the transparent peptide gel had an interesting side effect :
It seemed to halt bleeding within a few seconds , and then break down safely once an incision had healed .
When the peptides come into contact with blood , they appear to assemble into fibers , forming a na noscale barrier that stanches bleeding .
Terrence Norchi , a Natick doctor who serves as Arch Therapeutics ' chief executive , compares it to " a liquid Saran Wrap or Tyvek . "
Another benefit is that the gel does n't seem to spark an immune system response .
It also may be possible to apply the gel to an area before surgery , and cut through the gel - controlling the bleeding before it has a chance to get out of hand .
Steve Kelly , a onetime tech entrepreneur , spotted the research as a volunteer reviewing grant applications for MIT 's Deshpande Center for Technological Innovation , which aims to shepherd new ideas out of the lab and into widespread use .
After building and selling several big networking companies to buyers like Siemens AG and IBM Corp. , Kelly decided to shift into medical entrepreneurship .
" It felt like incremental innovations in networking just were n't going to have a big impact , " he says .
Instead , he found himself gravitating toward business concepts with more " social benefit " ; his first venture in that vein was Myomo Inc. , a Boston company that sells a device to help patients recovering from a stroke regain the use of their arms .
I live better than a king .
Sure , there are modern day kings who live better than me but they ’re mostly kings in title only .
When I say that I live better than a king I ’m referring to Medieval European kings .
While it ’s true that I do n’t make much money , have almost no power and do n’t come from a connected family I ’m still doing better than the most powerful men of 500 years ago .
Below I ’ve listed 5 reasons to supported my claim that I , Zervas , live better than the head honchos of yesteryear .
Life Expectancy :
People just did n’t live very long back in the day , even kings .
The average life expectancy of an English king was 46 years , from Offa in 774 to William the 3rd in 1702 the men who ruled England did n’t do so for very long .
The average life expectancy for U.S. males is about 75 years , that ’s nearly 30 years longer than the mean average for English kings .
Of course I ’m not average .
I ’m short and college educated which suggests that I ’ll live longer than the average American male .
Only one English King ( in the time period I ’m speaking of ) , Richard Cromwell , lived past 75 .
Where ’s your castle to save you now ?
Food :
I eat well , real well .
I eat off a plate , with a fork .
Kings ate off smashed bread , with their fingers .
Like a king , I eat mostly locally grown , organic , hormone - free food .
Unlike a king , if a type of fruit is n’t grown locally I just buy fruit that ’s flown in from the other side of the world .
All the power in the world could n’t get fresh non-local fruit to a king before it rotted .
I ’m sure Henry the Eighth would have liked some french fries or red sauce but the fact is he spent his whole life without tasting potatoes or tomatoes .
That ’s just sad .
Germs :
I ’m fairly cootie free .
I shower ever day and I use soap , that ’s right Richard the 1st ; soap .
In this day and age I have ready access to antiseptics and antibiotics .
It ’s amazing what a little penicillin will clear up .
It is true that I ca n’t order anyone to be beheaded but I can walk around without smelling like an outhouse .
Fair trade .
Climate control :
It ’s pretty well known that castles are drafty , not my house .
I have double insulated windows and central heating .
Not only do I get to be warm whenever I want but I am able to choose my warmth to within one degree Fahrenheit .
No smoke , no soot , just awesomeness .
If it gets too warm , Bam ! air conditioning .
I ’m sure a king gets some kind of ego trip by having servant girls fan him but I ’m not in it for the ego , I ’m in it for the cool .
The fact is accelerating warm air against sweaty skin just does n’t get one as cool as some wicked freon powered A/C .
Travel :
It was a pain in the ass to travel back in the day .
Kings had to travel by horse or by boat and it took effing forever to get anywhere .
I can fly across the country on a whim or travel to the grocers at 65 mph .
It ’s true I ’ve done little exploring outside the American Union but this is because I have n’t gotten around to it yet , not due to any actual limitations of travel .
If I wanted to I could be in Asia by the weekend , I just do n’t feel like it .
Despite what the story books say it sucked to live in medieval times , even if you were ruling said times .
The only thing a king has on me is power , which is something I do n’t crave .
From entertainment to education to standard of living I have it pretty good .
Sometimes I just need to take a step back to see that .
Just missed : toilet paper , electricity , dentists , mass media , hot chicks and TiVo .

Shortly after Konnie Huq finished her brief leg of London 's farcical Olympic torch relay on Sunday , she called a friend on her mobile phone .
" Did you see those blokes in the blue tracksuits ? " the former Blue Peter presenter whispered down the line .
" They were bloody aggressive , were n't they ? "
Huq had just been involved in a tussle with a protester , so it was surprising that what appeared to concern her most was the praetorian guard of Chinese officials who formed a wall around her during the short dash , rather than the demonstrator intent on wrestling the Olympic torch from her grasp .
But for any of the athletes , protesters , journalists and even police who found themselves guided , barged or fighting with this particularly committed group of Chinese minders , the identity and function of the " boys in blue tracksuits " was of paramount importance .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Little is known about the mysterious guards accompanying the flame on its " harmonious journey " , apart from the fact that they are well - trained security officers under the remit of the Beijing Games co-ordinators , who have sweeping political powers in China .
Officially the minders are " flame attendants " employed by the Beijing Olympic Organising Committee ( Bocog ) , which has organised the global relay .
Their role , in theory , is to be constantly on hand to ensure the flame never goes out .
At night and during airline flights , when the torch is kept in specially - made closed lanterns , three attendants guard it at all times .
Should the flame be extinguished during a relay , they are responsible for relighting it .
So far , so good .
But , although Commander Bob Broadhurst , the Metropolitan Police officer in charge of the route , insisted that flame attendants had no executive powers in Britain , their behaviour on Sunday indicated otherwise – or at least hinted that they were being allowed to overstep the mark .
Barging people out of the way , and even scuffling with some of the 1,000 police officers called in to provide extra security , the tracksuited guards made their presence felt across the capital .
Their behaviour has prompted many to ask whether Scotland Yard deliberately turned a blind eye to their tactics .
" Britain seems to have caved in to demands from Beijing that Chinese security agents police the streets of London , " said Matt Whitticase , of Free Tibet UK .
" It certainly fits in with the supine approach Britain has taken towards China over the years , compared with other nations . "
Shami Chakrabati , director of the human rights group Liberty , added : " Everyone appreciates the difficult duty of our police to hold the line between the Olympic ceremony and critics and supporters of the Chinese regime .
But who were the ominous figures running in formation in light blue uniforms ?
Where was their lawful authority to scuffle with policemen and protesters ? "
Yesterday in Paris , the flame attendants were forced to spend most of the relay on a bus .
But their dubious security techniques could well be back on display tomorrow when the torch arrives in San Francisco – depending , of course , on how they are viewed by American law enforcement agencies .

With its rows of needle - sharp teeth , the pike is a feared predator in the water world .
But this one had n't a hope when a hungry cormorant decided it was supper time .
The bird pounced on the foot - long pike with its hooked bill and pulled it to the surface of a lake .
The two antagonists grappled for a few seconds before , in one swift movement , the magnificent bird extended and twisted its neck in preparation for supper .
Scroll down for more ...
Its highly elastic throat allowed the cormorant to gobble the pike down whole within seconds .
These shots of nature in the raw were captured by amateur photographer Stewart Canham , 61 , as he sat quietly in a lakeside hide .
He lifted his camera after spotting the cormorant out of the corner of his eye .
The amazing scene , at Langford Lakes in Steeple Langford , near Salisbury , Wilts , was all over within 10 seconds .
At the end , Mr Canham snapped the bird with just the fishtail poking out of its beak .
Mr Canham , from Gillingham , Dorset , said : " I had been in a hide for about an hour when I saw a cormorant going for a pike out of the corner of my eye .
" It kept diving under the water and then I saw the white belly of the pike on the surface so I quickly jumped into action with my camera .
Scroll down for more ...
" The cormorant was desperately trying to get the pike into its mouth but it was struggling .
" Then the bird suddenly stretched out its neck and twisted it before swallowing the pike down in one .
Mr Canham was delighted with his luck .
" Quite often I manage to get pictures of birds after they have swallowed their dinner but never a sequence of the event as good as this , " he said .
" It was an amazing sight that was all over in the blink of an eye . "
Sophie Atherton , from the RSPB , said cormorants can swallow creatures up to two - and - a - half feet long .
She said : " Cormorants have been recorded to eat 86 different species of fish from tiny fry to two - and - a - half - foot - long conger eels .
" They have an elasticated throat and a special hinged beak that enables them to eat large creatures .
" Basically they pull their distended neck out of shape to get the giant fish down . "
She added : " Records have shown that a cormorant was once found to have an 11 - and - a - half - inch kitten in its stomach .
" Obviously , an incident like this is extremely rare but it shows how big they can stretch out their throats . "
The cormorants are such good hunters that in China fishermen use them to catch their fish .
Throat rings are placed around the necks of the birds to prevent them from swallowing their catch .

Release date May 26 , 2008
Summary
The document , dated May 15 , 2008 , and disowned by the McCain campaign team , presents a memorandum by ' S. Schmidt ' , likely Steven Schmidt , McCain 's senior campaign advisor .
It outlines a strategy designed to increase rivalry between followers of the Democratic Party candidates Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama .
Several specific techniques are described including organizing Clinton " meet-ups " ( http://hrclinton.meetup.com/).
The memo appears to have been sent to a wider McCain campaign team group which focussed on internet based campaigning .
According to the memo , conflict between Clinton and Obama has created the possibility , on the event of an Obama nomination , to ' depress the turnout of key Democratic demographics in November ' .
To reach voters consisting mainly of ' white , female voters over the age of 40 ' , a strategy has been worked out , based on newly tested ' lines of attack through independent pro-Clinton communities on the Internet ' , ' local " meet - ups " ' , and similar means .
The document identifies three messages believed to ' resonate well ' with the demographic and which it hopes will weaken Obama 's growth following Clinton 's loss of the nomination .
Sen . Obama ’s connection to Rev. Wright
His inexperience
His links to the corrupt Chicago political machine
The memo calls for a ' greater commitment on the part of McCain ’s fundraisers and our various media partners ' to help in the alienation effort , as an example ' Clinton 's campaign narrative about the unfair treatment that some networks , specifically MSNBC , have given her camp ' .
Is the memo fabricated ?
On May 27 ( prior to publication ) Wikileaks gave the McCain campaign team a copy of document .
After some delay spokesman Jeff Sadosky claimed that the document was not authentic but would not go into further detail .
An interesting possible linguistic clue as to the source of this document is the phrase " planning to unroll a new campaign " .
It is far more common to use the phrase " planning to roll out a new campaign " .
Searching Google for the phrase " planning to unroll " turns up a single page with 14 results .
A search for the more normal " planning to roll out " phrasing turns up more than 100,000 hits .
Additionally , a search for the phrase " planning to roll our " ( a result of a typo ) returns eight results , more than half as many hits as for the " unroll " search returns .
Where is this phrasing from ?
What does it indicate as to the source of the document ?
Is there any evidence that Steven Schmidt uses this phrasing ?
No :
Election campaigns have a history of producing many more true leaks than fabricated ones .
Campaign committees have a history of denying true leaked memos .
The memo is highly critical of Obama , but only Obama 's campaign stands to benefit from a fabrication .
Election campaigns are long , fast moving and stressful .
There is a history of injudicious memos having been written during election campaigns .
Informal language is frequently used within a campaign group .
Campaign groups tend to become very close , united by their common purpose .
If engaging in a fabrication a politically stronger fabrication could have been produced .
Despite Wikileaks sitting on the document for several days while waiting for comment from the McCain team the memo has not appeared elsewhere on the internet or in the press .
Nor did the McCain spokesperson mention that they had seen it before .
The source , in their submission said they were unhappy about the " astroturfing " issue and that there was " no urgency " in releasing the document .
Genuine sources want protection , but campaign fabricators want maximal dissemination , so why has n't the document been disseminated elsewhere ?
Yes :
Unequivocal denial from McCain spokesperson Jeff Sadosky .
Election campaigns have a history of producing some fabricated leaks .
Motive is present .
The memo 's dissemination would benefit Obama at the expense of Clinton and McCain .
Would the McCain team be so injudicious as to write , in passing , ' We have organized dozens of “ meet - ups ” across the country for Clinton supporters '? ( " meet - ups " are organized on - line so , this is not quite as strong as it might initially imply )
'? ( " meet - ups " are organized on - line so , this is not quite as strong as it might initially imply ) Relatively informal language .
If the document is fabricated , then the people and methods behind the frame - up are of substantial interest .
If the document is legitimate then it reveals wilful duplicity on the behalf of McCain .
Regardless , two far more interesting questions arise -- to what extent is McCain following the strategy , if not the method , depicted -- depressing the turnout of Clinton women , by enhancing their sense of victimhood and to what extent is Clinton turning a blind eye to assistance from such unusual quarters ?

When one sees a modern city from the air , especially at night , it is a truly awe - inspiring spectacle .
What always strikes me is the immensity of the project , a testimony to the power and creativity of human beings .
However , on the ground and actually living and working in this wonder , things are quite different and the social and ecological problems crowd in and fill one ’s view .
The truth is that our cities have always been dominated by the rich and powerful and built and operated to serve their needs — not those of the mass of working people who live and toil in them .

Problems of urban life
And today the destructive effect on the quality of urban life of the capitalist pursuit of profits before anything else is growing alarmingly .
Here is a short and far from complete list :
Modern capitalist cities are absolutely dominated by cars and the trucks .
This leads to massive , life - threatening pollution and a vast network of roads and car parks which scars the urban landscape .
People live on islands surrounded by seas of asphalt and concrete — 40 % or more of the city surface is asphalt and concrete .
The city creates its own , warmer climate .
Motor vehicles also directly kill and maim large numbers of people each year ; still greater numbers die from the pollution .
Vehicle emissions are also a major contributor to greenhouse gases and the climate change which threatens the human race with utter catastrophe .
The corollary of this is that public transport systems are weak and take second place to the motor car .
Similarly , the great bulk of freight is carried by trucks not rail .
Developers aided by governments have created the appalling urban sprawl with all its ecological and social consequences ( erosion of farmland , huge distances between home and work , etc. , etc. ) .
The word “ developers ” , of course , is an appalling euphemism — capitalist sharks would be a more accurate description .
And now , in the name of urban consolidation , these same developers are being encouraged to build their often crappy blocks of units anywhere and everywhere .
In Melbourne this has led to a great deal of angst in the suburbs .
And one result is no better than the other .
Then let ’s look at what the developers actually construct .
Modern houses and buildings are generally not only hard to maintain but ecologically wasteful and often extremely unhealthy ( emissions from building materials , plastics and cleaning agents ) .
They could be designed differently — we could easily have ecologically sensible houses instead of the current extremely wasteful “ McMansions ” favoured by the building industry .
In the cities , public land — modest though it is — is constantly being alienated by greedy developers in league with councils and city and state governments .
Not only are house prices soaring beyond the reach of most workers , but homelessness is growing sharply ( estimated to be over 100,000 nationally ) as governments refuse to build public housing and rely on the market to solve everything ( preferring to give subsidies to people to rent from private landlords ) .
Shopping centres ( malls and supermarkets ) dominate much of city life .
They kill most of the neighbourhood shops and force people to rely on cars to do their shopping .
But these juggernauts are purely the result of the capitalist thirst for profit — they appear before us as facts of life ; people never get to discuss what is really needed .
Moreover , the ubiquitous shopping mall represents a serious privatisation of social space — we all have to use them and they thus fulfil a social function but access and control is wholly in the hands of the private owners .
And as the supermarkets and malls kill off many of the neighbourhood shops , their place is taken by chain outlets ( 7 - 11 , Coles Express , petrol station shops ) all offering emergency supplies — at much higher prices .
Within the city we have the hypertrophy — a monstrous swelling — of the city centre ( full of truly ugly buildings all jostling for position ) and the bleak wasteland of the sprawling suburbs .
In the sixties , “ decentralisation ” was a buzzword .
Governments encouraged a modest movement of services and industry to regional centres .
But today country towns and villages are dying as governments cut services and jobs and banks close branches .
This has a multiplier effect .
People move to the city ( or at least to the big regional centres ) and the rural crisis intensifies .
There is a movement back to some regional centres but — under the wonderful capitalist system we have — it becomes ghastly caricature of what is really needed .
The rich and middle classes build holiday homes in coastal towns forcing up prices and making life impossible for ordinary people ( working - class pensioners and renters ) who have to move elsewhere .
Peak oil and climate change
On top of the all the above , as the concept of peak oil and the eventual end of this finite resource laid down over millions of years gains currency , the fragility of the modern city is suddenly laid bare .
The movie The End of Suburbia demonstrates very well how the American suburbs have been built on the automobile .
If the motor vehicle as we know it goes — i.e. , can no longer serve as mode of mass transport — then the urban sprawl becomes even more untenable and an alternative way of living becomes desperately urgent .
Similarly , climate change has put a big question mark over the modern city .
Effecting a drastic and rapid reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is a life - and - death question .
In Australia , perhaps the most dramatic manifestation of climate change for the cities is the question mark over water supplies .
Achieving water security and sustainability is a burning issue .
To date , the main response of state and federal governments has been to go for big - budget projects ( in Victoria , a desalination plant and a diversion pipeline to take scarce water from the equally drought - affected Murray - Goulburn irrigation area in the north ) .
Arguably , such responses do not address the real problem and will actually make it worse .
( For instance , Victoria ’s projected desalination plant will be a major emitter of greenhouse gases . )
All in all , climate change calls into question so many aspects of our current urban existence .
The motor vehicle culture which big business has foisted on us is no longer viable ( if it ever was ) .
If declining fuel supplies and ever - more - expensive petrol costs do n’t kill it off , surely climate change will .
Public transport systems will have to be developed to replace it .
The urban sprawl especially characteristic of Australian capital cities — which compels people to travel vast distances to get to work — will have to give way to some form of consolidation .
The hypertrophy of the city centre and the bleakness of much of the suburbs needs to be overcome .
A much better spread of jobs would mean that people did n’t have to travel vast differences to work .
In my opinion , over time the fetish of the ¼ - acre block — the equivalent of every family owning its own car — would start to ease and eventually disappear as people realised that denser living with radically improved public amenities ( parks , transport , services ) had a lot to offer ( c.f. some European cities ) .
As currently constructed , our houses and buildings embody huge amounts of water and energy and considerable greenhouse gas emissions .
Moreover , their actual operation is characterised by a high and unsustainable energy and water consumption .
Climate change will put our food supply under extreme pressure .
What foods we eat , how they are transported and distributed will become burning questions .
As well as finding ways to guarantee our food security , reducing the water and energy consumed in the whole process will be vitally important .
We need a much more uniform distribution of the population over the countryside .
At the very least , the cities must get smaller and the country towns grow .
But , unlike what is happening today , this needs to be done in such a way that jobs and services move out also , transport access is maintained and actual living communities are created .
In time , the traditional isolation of the countryside would disappear along with the swollen capital city with its bloated centre .
In this regard socialists reject the current developer - driven model whereby greenfields housing estates gobble up precious farmland and create McMansions - style ghettos on the fringes of the city , isolated and with few amenities , a trap for housewives and the elderly and a terrific burden for those who have travel vast distances to work .
We can surely work out something much better .
Abandon affluence ?
As an aside , Ted Trainer , in his 1985 book Abandon Affluence , had a lot to say on the modern city .
But his non-Marxist , radical green framework marred a lot of the useful points he made .
He saw “ overconsumption ” by the West as the source of the global ecological crisis .
In his book he bases everything on reducing consumption .
Marxists , of course , see the fundamental problem not as “ overconsumption ” but the capitalist drive for profits ahead of all else ; achieving a relative material abundance is essential if humanity is to leave class conflict behind and achieve full communism .
With modern technology , it would be quite possible to achieve relative material abundance and — by improving production processes and eliminating the wastefulness of capitalist production and society — at the same time actually reduce our ecological footprint massively .
One can say generally that the West consumes too many resources but this obscures the reality that these are class - divided societies and a large proportion of the population does n’t consume very much at all .
For example , in the United States there is a huge internal Third World which radically underconsumes the necessities of life .
They are not responsible in any way for the profligacy of the US — that should be sheeted home squarely to the ruling capitalist plutocracy .

While we oppose the wasteful use of resources and while we too are opposed to capitalist consumerism , posing the problem in terms of reducing consumption as such is wrong and would be political suicide for the socialist movement .
For instance , supermarkets , for all their capitalistic form , are actually a tremendous labour - and time - saving convenience .
The liberation of women and the whole working class has many aspects ; a key one is reducing drudgery to the minimum .
We want to go forwards from capitalism , not backwards .
Ted Trainer ’s city of the future has a very definite reactionary , feudal , labor - intensive feel to it , but even allowing for this rather basic weakness , he does paint a thought - provoking picture of the new city , with the old freeways and roads dug up , with vegetable gardens where the factories once stood , etc .
Monstrous beast in the room
Making our cities livable and grappling with peak oil , climate change and sustainability are really one and the same thing .
Ideally , we would have a big discussion , develop a rational plan and then organise ourselves to implement it .
If we were , say , a small community living in ancient times before the development of class society , that is exactly what we would have done .
But today , the problem is not that the population has grown but that the economy on which we all depend — the productive apparatus and everything associated with it — is not owned collectively by society but by a tiny handful of capitalists .
Working people ’s labour operates the means of production — in that sense it is social — but a few per cent of the population privately own it .
This is the monstrous , slavering beast in the room .
At every turn of the wheel it has to fed .
Its ravenous appetite must be satisfied ahead of any human need .
What it wants — profits and ever more profits — is not what the rest of us want — i.e. , meaningful action on climate change and other social problems .
For example , look at what is happening in Victoria right now .
The big - business - oriented Brumby ALP government is moving at high speed in the opposite direction to what is needed to confront peak oil and climate change :
Rather than a massive program of fitting all dwellings with water tanks and recycling systems , imposing conservation targets on industry and agribusiness , and establishing the infrastructure for large - scale stormwater capture , it has signed off on the desalination plant and the northern pipeline — bonanzas for big business but a disaster for the rest of us .
Water bills for ordinary households are projected to double within five years .
Rather than a program to phase out our disastrous dependence on brown coal and make the switch to renewable energy , the ALP government is intent on pursuing the mirage of “ clean coal ” technology .
( As someone said , this will turn the Earth into a giant soda fountain . )
Power prices are also set to double for ordinary users over the next few years .
It refuses to put the necessary resources into public transport which exists in absolutely infuriating and permanent crisis ; instead its program is roads , more roads and still more roads .
Now it is inching towards a truly insane monster road tunnel under Melbourne ’s general cemetery .
Not even the dead are to be left to rest in peace !
It is going ahead with a radical dredging of Melbourne 's Port Phillip Bay which , among other things , threatens to lead to the flooding of low - lying suburbs at high tide .
And all this is so that bigger ships — laden with yet more consumerist crap — can transit the bay .
It has given the go - ahead to GM canola .
Brumby ’s utterly ludicrous comment was that this was giving the consumer “ choice ” !
The consumers do n’t want this sort of fake “ choice ” — they want safe foods .
GM was given the green light to give a profit bonanza to Monsanto and a few big exporters ; the rest of us will pay the price ( an increase in allergies and who knows what other long - term health damage ) .
Public ownership and planning
In order to grapple with the crisis of climate change we need a total mobilisation of society and a drastic and rapid reorientation of our entire economy .
But to imagine that anything can compel a horde of profit - crazed corporations to be “ responsible ” is utterly fanciful .
The commanding heights of the economy must be in public hands .
Socialists call for the nationalisation of the entire energy sector ( coal , oil , gas , the power stations and distribution systems , wind farms , etc. ) .
This vital infrastructure must belong to the community — whether it is in federal , state or municipal hands .
The charter of this sector must be to phase out the fossil fuel power plants and make the “ big switch ” to renewable energy as quickly as possible .
The public transport and freight systems must also be in public hands .
The aim must be to achieve a drastic and rapid reduction in the use of motor vehicles .
The roads should be kept safe ; apart from that , massive investments must be poured into rail , trams and feeder bus systems .
The automobile industry should likewise be nationalised .
The car plants should be retooled to produce public transport stock and renewable power equipment .
As the crisis of climate change bites deeper , food security will become a big issue for society .
We ca n’t leave the bulk of the distribution system in the hands of profit - gouging supermarket chains like Coles and Woolworths , that exploit small suppliers and consumers alike .
They too should be brought under public ownership .
The banks , which underpin the capitalist economy , should be nationalised and a single state bank created .
This would guarantee bank workers jobs , provide services and generate funds for the reconstruction of the economy .
Economic planning based on public ownership of the means of production has tremendous power .
Here is just one example .
In 1967 Isaac Deutscher , the renowned biographer of Trotsky , published The Unfinished Revolution , his well - known study of the Soviet Union .
He pointed out that if you allowed for all the years the USSR took to simply get back to pre-war levels of production ( following the World War I and the Civil War and then World War II ) , then in the equivalent of a mere 25 peaceful years — from a very low base — it had created the second most powerful industrial economy in the world .
Put aside Stalinist bureaucratism and repression , the deliberate neglect of consumer needs in favour of heavy industry , and the damage to the environment — this example nevertheless shows the enormous power of collective labour , once it is freed from the shackles of capitalism and allocated according to a conscious plan .
Fight for the future
Of course , the capitalist class has immense power and wealth and will not give it up without a tremendous struggle .
Only the growth of a vast popular movement , solidly based on the great working - class majority , can succeed here .
The development of a movement to fight for meaningful action on climate change will at the same time prepare the political conditions for a workers government which will finally bring the economy under collective ownership and control .
This — and only this — will enable us to begin to construct a society based on the fulfilment of human needs and living sustainably in harmony with nature .

In Tintin 's last - but - one - adventure , Flight 714 , our intrepid boy reporter and his friends find themselves on a small and deserted Indonesian island .
The first intimation that things may not quite be as they seem comes when a rather bemused - looking but undeniably giant lizard ambles out of the bushes .
" What on earth 's that ? " exclaims Captain Haddock .
" A monitor , " replies Tintin .
" What 's it doing here , pestilential pachyderm ? " demands Haddock , displaying his usual grasp of alliteration ( and absence of scientific knowledge ) .
" It looks like it 's escaped from the ice age ! "
The alert reader will have spotted several errors here .
This reptile was plainly not a pachyderm , any more than it had escaped from the ice age .
Nor , except occasionally in scientific literature , is it called a monitor .
It was , in fact , a Komodo dragon , the largest and , as this Tintin episode usefully demonstrates , probably the most widely misunderstood lizard known to man .
Komodo dragons certainly sound scary .
They grow to lengths of between 2 metres and 3 metres ( 7 ft - 10 ft ) , weigh up to 68kg ( 150lbs ) , and live for up to 50 years .
For short bursts , they can run at up to 24 kmh ( 15 mph ) .
When young , before they get too big , they climb trees and dive 4.5 m underwater .
Their scales contain small pieces of bone , making them effectively armour - plated .
They are capable of virgin births .
They are carnivorous , feasting mainly on carrion but also going for live birds , mammals and , occasionally , people .
They have a long forked tongue , big claws and 60 razor - sharp , inch - long teeth .
They eat 80 % of their body weight at one sitting .
And their saliva is deadly poisonous ; if you 're bitten and get away , you 'll probably die of blood poisoning anyway .
Nor has the Komodo 's reputation been much enhanced by the events of recent days .
" It was big ...
It tried to have a go at my feet , " was how Helena Nevalainen , a Swedish member of the scuba diving group rescued this weekend from the Indonesian island of Rinca , described to the world 's media her chilling encounter with the one she had to fight off three times using her lead - weighted diving belt .
" I threw my belt .
He came back and bit it , and then he let go .
After that he came back one more time .
I am just happy I 'm here , alive . "
But how dangerous are they really ?
" They 're arguably one of the most intelligent reptiles on the planet , " insists Ian Stephen , assistant curator of the herpetology department at London Zoo , which has two Komodos .
" They demonstrate a real capacity to play , they recognise their keepers , they can distinguish between different people 's voices .
I 'd liken them to a big dog like a doberman , say : they are very powerful and they have the potential to be very dangerous .
But like most of these things , the actual risk is wildly exaggerated . "
Outside captivity , the Komodo dragon , or Varanus komodoensis , is confined to the islands of Komodo , Rinca , Flores , Gili Motang and Gili Dasami in central Indonesia , which certainly helps as far as reducing risk is concerned .
The species was discovered by Europeans only in 1910 , when a Lieutenant Steyn van Hensbroek of the Dutch colonial administration heard rumours of a huge and terrifying " land crocodile " .
These days there are probably fewer than 6,000 of them left in the wild , and they are protected by a raft of national and international laws .
The reptiles have a highly developed sense of smell , and can detect a dead animal from as far as five miles away .
Komodos are ambush predators , lying in wait for prey that may include smaller dragons , birds , rats , monkeys , wild pigs , goats , deer and even horses and water buffaloes .
Once the victim is close enough the reptile will pounce , going for the soft underbelly or throat of its victim and using its powerful , loosely articulated jaws to tear off big chunks of meat .
Smaller prey , up to goat size , is consumed whole ; Komodos have been seen charging trees with the dead in their mouths to ram it further down their throats .
" The one danger that 's not exaggerated , though , is their saliva , " says Stephen .
" Any prey that is bitten but escapes will probably die of septicemia within three days . "
Even a bite from a captive Komodo , whose saliva will contain many fewer than the 70 - 80 deadly bacteria typically found in the mouth of a wild specimen , will necessitate an intensive course of powerful antibiotics , he warns .
( It is in captivity , incidentally , that Komodos have shown themselves capable of what is known as parthenogenesis : in 2005 and 2006 , two females at London and Chester zoos , Sungai and Flora , both laid clutches of viable eggs despite having had no contact with male dragons . )
But despite all the scare stories , attacks on humans are very rare .
Komodo islanders are used to living around the reptiles : their houses are built on stilts , they keep a close watch on their children , take care when venturing into the undergrowth , and if they do encounter a dragon intent on doing them harm , use sticks and stones to drive it off .
In fact , the first recorded fatal attack in 33 years occurred last year , when a dragon attacked an eight - year - old boy who , Stephen says , " wandered into the bushes for a pee and was unlucky enough to come across a dragon in ambush " .
Komodos are , however , no respecters of reputations .
In another incident , the executive editor of the San Francisco Chronicle , Phil Bronstein - married at the time to Sharon Stone - was badly bitten on the foot by a Komodo at Los Angeles zoo in 2001 .
Bronstein had to undergo surgery to reattach several severed tendons after a keeper told him to remove his white trainers so the dragon did n't mistake them for the white rats it was usually fed for its meals .
( " Whose idea was it , " one of the paper 's readers later commented , " to remove the white shoes from the white feet of a white man in the hopes of not confusing a near - sighted , simple - minded , ravenously hungry lizard accustomed to a diet of white rats ? " )
Incredibly powerful , then ; potentially dangerous ; but on the whole , a bit of a bad rap .
Unless you 're very unlucky .
In which case , best beware of pestilential pachyderms .
While doing research for an earlier post I ran across a document called a “ Leader ’s Guide ” on one of the official Expelled web - sites .
This little bit of propaganda which was created “ to assist you with promoting the issues surrounding the film Expelled “ .
It is filled to the brim with rhetoric , misinformation , out of context quotations , and half - truths that have been staples in antievolutionist literature , since long before the latest version , “ intelligent design ” evolved from its parent species “ creation science ” in the late 1980’s .
To demonstrate the evolutionary link between these ideologies I will often follow quotes from the Guide ( in blue for clarity ) with quotes from pre-ID movement , “ creation science ” sources making identical , or nearly identical , statements .
The “ creation science ” material I am referencing is mostly from well known young Earth creationists dated prior to 1991 , the year Phillip Johnson published Darwin On Trial , which is often said to have launched the ID movement .
The use of pre-1991 material ensures that there was no chance of backwards contamination from ID creationists back to “ creation science ” advocates .
Something common in later YEC literature .
The document is divided up into six sections .
Introduction Cosmology Molecular Biology Paleontology
Where does the science lead ?
Why Does It Matter ?
I will primarily address the material in sections 1 , 3 , and 4 which are areas I am more familiar with .
This is in no way intended to be a complete refutation of the material found in the “ Leader ’s Guide ” , rather I am just going to hit a few highlights that I felt were particularly telling or egregious .
The Introduction
The introduction begins with a logical fallacy known as an “ argumentum ad populum “ .
The idea that if a lot of people believe something then there must be something to it or that at least it should be seriously considered merely because it is popular .
Attached to this fallacy is essentially a conspiracy theory interwoven with an appeal to let the masses decide .
L.G. Despite the fact that most Americans believe that God created life , the only “ origin of life ” theory taught in the majority of American schools is Neo- Darwinism …
Despite the compelling modern science in support of intelligent design , and despite the fact that most Americans want the evidence for and against Darwin ’s theory taught in schools , any questioning of Darwinism is systematically suppressed in nearly all academic and scientific communities .
The suppression of new scientific ideas – particularly those that pertain to the origins of life – presents today ’s students with a one - sided argument in the court of public opinion .
It ’s as if they ’re a jury being shown evidence for only ONE SIDE of the case .
All evidence from the opposing side is being thrown out of court , not by the jury or even the judge , but by the side presenting the contrary argument !
It ’s suppression at its worst , where the implications reach far beyond the classroom .
Expelled : No Intelligence Allowed seeks to expose this suppression and give today ’s students a glimpse into the amazing discoveries that modern science is revealing .
In the pages of this Expelled Discussion Guide , you ’ll be given the facts being hidden from most students today .
( p.2 )
Setting aside the argumentum ad populum and the conspiracy theory , we have here a clear echo of the “ equal time for creation science ” and appeal to fairness that was common in the literature of the ancestor of ID creationism .
To restrict the teaching concerning origins to a single theory , that of organic evolution , and to teach it as an established scientific fact , constitutes indoctrination in a humanistic religious philosophy .
Such a procedure violates the Constitutional prohibition against the teaching of sectarian religious views just as clearly as if the teaching concerning origins were restricted to the Book of Genesis .
In the spirit of fairness and of academic freedom we plead for a balanced presentation of all the evidence .
( Duane Gish 1973 , emphasis mine )
In view of the fact that evolution and creation are the only two possible concepts of origins , that evolution requires at least as much of a “ religious ” faith as does creation , and that creation fits all the “ scientific ” data at least as well as does evolution , it is clear that both should be taught in the schools and other public institutions of our country , and that this should be done on an equal - time , equal - emphasis basis , in so far as possible .
This is obviously the only equitable and fair approach to take , the only one consistent with traditional American principles of religious freedom , civil rights , freedom of information , scientific objectivity , academic freedom , and constitutionality .
( Henry Morris 1975 , emphasis mine )
The present practice of programming young minds in public schools to a single religious ( and anti-theistic ) point of view is unconscionable .
Nevertheless , the anti-creationist , the humanist and the liberal theologian continue to demand this new religion , and they are succeeding only because they control curricula in our schools .
Scientific integrity !
It does n’t appear that students can expect to find it among the anti-creationists .
On the other hand , creationist scientists are pleading , on behalf of students around the world , for good science , good education , and the highest standards of integrity in science education .
These students deserve to hear all the scientific data in an honest context .
They deserve to be educated so they can be their own decision makers .
This is the essence of “ scientific integrity . ” ( Richard Bliss 1985 , emphasis mine )
Of course the viability of scientific theories is not determined by the “ court of public opinion ” , i.e. the general public ( the majority of the jurors in that “ court ” being scientifically illiterate ) , rather it is decided by the consensus view of the relevant portion of the scientific community ; in this case primarily biologists and paleontologists .
Of course the court of science reached its verdict in the case of creation v. evolution nearly 150 years ago , and the facts of nature being what they are , it did n’t go the creationist ’s way .
No jury of ill informed lay persons , tainted as they are by creationist propaganda like that found in this Guide , can change the facts of nature .
A theme that runs throughout this document is another creationist staple ; that being a not so subtle attempt to characterize evolution as a “ random ” , “ accidental ” process , here are the to most blatant examples :
L.G. … Neo - Darwinism , which at its core holds that a random undirected process has led from non-life to all of the marvellous [ sic ] complexity we see in the living world .
( p.2 , emphasis mine )
L.G.Darwinian evolution argues that life arose from a primordial sea on a lifeless planet through a chance collision of chemicals , and that over billions of years , this biological accident gave rise to all of life , including humans .
In other words : NOTHING + TIME AND CHANCE = EVERYTHING ( p.6 , emphasis mine )
L.G. What is Darwinism ?
Unguided process produces new forms of life through random mutations
Nothing +
Time / Chance = Everything ( outline p. 3 , emphasis mine )
Natural selection is mentioned repeatedly ( usually in conjunction with random mutation ) , but its relationship to random mutation in neo -Darwinian theory is never adequately explained .
Nor is it made clear that while natural selection may be a “ blind ” , “ unguided ” process it is absolutely non-random .
Of course , like much in the Guide this mischaracterization of Darwinian evolution as being merely a chance process has its roots in earlier forms of creationism :
At the heart of the evolutionary viewpoint is the assumption that the universe , including its psychological life forms , is the result of a strictly materialistic process involving vast amounts of time and random changes .
If one assumes the validity of this “ time plus chance ” explanation , it becomes very difficult to believe that present natural phenomena are as complex as they might superficially appear .
( Paul D. Ackerman 1977 , emphasis mine )
Evolutionists ultimately believe , to use an example from commercial television , that frogs turn into princes .
But if the mechanism turned out to be the kiss of a princess rather than time , chance , and the properties of matter , then the evolutionary explanation for change would be wrong and the theory falsified in this instance .
Whether it ’s the changing of frogs into princes , fish into philosophers , or molecules into men , calling evolution a fact without at least broadly specifying a mechanism is both non-science and non-sense – unless evolutionists are willing to consider the kiss of a princess a potentially valid evolutionary hypothesis !
Creationists do n’t believe that frogs turn into princes at all , of course , but rather that frogs and people were separately created from the same kinds of molecular “ building blocks . ”
Remember the tumbled pebble and the arrowhead ( Fig. 1 ) ?
Both were shaped from the same substance , one by the means or mechanism of time and chance acting on the inherent properties of matter ; the other by the means of [ sic ] mechanism of design and creation , producing irreducible properties of organization .
Mechanisms – the explanation of how – is , therefore , the heart of the creation / evolution issue .
Substance , adaptation , and change are the “ givens ” or “ facts ” shared by those on both sides .
The central question is : how – by what means or mechanism – did these patterns of order come into being : by time and chance like the tumbled pebble ; or , like the arrowhead , by design and creation ?
( Morris & Parker 1987 , pp. 110-111 , emphasis mine )
Their real objection is that evolutionary theory seems to conflict with their theological beliefs in an interventionalist deity :
L.G.
At its core , Darwinism explicitly excludes purpose or intelligent guidance from the history of the development of life . ( p.3 )
However , what they really mean is that it excludes supernatural intelligent guidance .
This makes evolutionary theory no different than any other scientific theory .
Strangely though we do n’t hear about how horrible germ theory is given that it excludes supernatural intelligent guidance ( except maybe from the followers of Christian Science ) , or how atomic theory is just a cover for atheism because it excludes supernatural intelligent guidance as an explainatory mechanism .
The difference here is not that evolutionary theory is somehow more “ materialistic ” or “ atheistic ” than any other scientific theory ; it is that evolutionary theory conflicts with their theology whereas germ and atomic theory do not .
L.G. Despite what we continue to read in the popular press and textbooks , modern science is increasingly raising serious questions about Darwinism along with other key elements of the “ materialistic ” worldview . ( p.3 )
There are no “ serious questions ” about the overall validity of evolutionary theory in the scientific community ; though disputes about the details continue , as they do around all well established scientific theories .
The only people pushing this business about there being a “ controversy ” or “ serious questions ” about evolution , are antievolutionists motivated largely by the fact that evolutionary theory ( and often other scientific theories ) conflicts with their personal theological beliefs .
Cosmology
L.G. The “ Anthropic Principle ” states that if the physical structure of the universe were even slightly different , life would not exist . ( p.5 )
I wo n’t linger here as cosmology is outside my main area of knowledge ( evolutionary biology , paleontology , and creationist claims about them ) .
The whole section seems to be little more than a reiteration of the anthropic principle which always struck me as something akin to being surprised that our legs are long enough to reach the ground .
That life like ours exists in a universe suitable to supporting our form of life is n’t terribly shocking .
It would be much more puzzling if life like ours existed in a universe that was n’t suitable to support our form of life .
Molecular Biology section
L.G. When Charles Darwin first proposed his theory , the world within the cell was unknown .
Darwin and his contemporaries built their early theories believing the cell was very simple .
They could not have been more wrong .
The inner workings of the cell are a fantastic assembly of intricately intertwined biological machinery which is vastly more complicated than anything humans have engineered .
( p.6 )
It is true that in the mid-19th century , science had not yet learned of how complex the inner workings of the cell are .
But at the time , and for that matter even today , living things outside their cells are more complex than anything engineered by humans .
The average adult human has something like one trillion cells making up their bodies with different cell types making up our various organs and tissues .
Cell theory was well accepted by the time Darwin published the Origin of Species ( 1859 ) , so even though he and his contemporaries were not aware of the further complexity of the interior of cells , they did understand that they were dealing with incredibly complex systems .
And they faced basically the same argument from creationists of their day , only then the focus was on “ organs of extreme perfection ” such as the eye , rather than bacterial flagella .
In fact Darwin titled a section of the sixth chapter of the Origin of Species “ Organs of extreme Perfection and Complication ” .
Ironically , the Leader ’s Guide prominently quotes the very first paragraph from this section in a sidebar ( p.9 ) to the molecular biology section of the document entitled “ Darwin in his own words ” .
L.G. “ To suppose that the eye , with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances , for admitting different amounts of light , and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration , could have been formed by natural selection , seems , I freely confess , absurd in the highest degree . ” ( p.9 )
This quote will be recognizable to just about anyone who follows the machinations of the antievolutionist movement , as it is probably the archetypal creationist out - of - context quotation ( something they never tire of using ) .
Darwin himself was acutely aware of this evidence of creation and the problem it posed for his theory .
In a chapter of Origin of Species called “ Difficulties With the Theory , ” he included traits that depend on separately meaningless parts .
Consider the human eye with the different features required to focus at different distances , to accommodate different amounts of light , and to correct for the “ rainbow effect . ”
Regarding the origin of the eye Darwin wrote these words :
To suppose the eye , [ with so many parts all working together ] … could have been formed by natural selection , seems , I freely confess , absurd in the highest degree .
“ Absurd in the highest degree . ”
That ’s Darwin ’s own opinion of using natural selection to explain the origin of traits that depend on many parts working together .
( Morris & Parker 1987 , pp. 86 - 88 , emphasis mine )
Charles Darwin acknowledged the utter inadequacy of the evolutionary theory when attempting to account for a structure such as the eye : “ To suppose that the eye , with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances , for admitting different amounts of light , and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration , could have been formed by natural selection , seems , I freely confess , absurd in the highest degree …
The belief that an organ as perfect as the eye could have formed by natural selection is more than enough to stagger anyone ”
An incomprehensible constellation of favorable , integrated , and synchronized mutations would have to occur to produce an organ such as the eye .
( Huse 1983 , p. 73 , emphasis mine )
Consider the eye , for example , “ with all its inimitable contrivances , ” as Darwin called them , which can admit different amounts of light , focus at different distances , and correct spherical and chromatic aberration .
Consider also the splitting of pigment molecules that must be coupled to nerve impulse initiation , and consider that none of these impulses has any meaning apart from millions of neurons integrated into interpretive centers in the brain .
Each of these features of optic structure and function is a complex trait itself , and none of these separate components would have any meaning or “ survival value , ” until nearly all were put together in a functioning whole of compounded complexities .
No wonder Darwin wrote : “ To suppose that the eye , … could have been formed by natural selection , seems , I freely confess , absurd in the highest degree . ” ( Gary Parker 1980 , emphasis mine )
And just to show you how far back this goes with creationists , here is a 19th century example :
The believer in the teleological argument , that the Supreme Creator worked by design , when He pronounced all things “ very good , ” naturally thinks of such an object as “ the eye , ” in contradiction of this speculative theory ; but Darwin has anticipated him by candidly owning the weakness of his own argument .
“ To suppose that the eye , with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances , for admitting different amounts of light , and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration , could have been formed by natural selection , seems , I freely confess , absurd in the highest degree . ”
I suppose most persons possessed with the average amount of common sense will agree with him .
Nevertheless there are infidels bold enough to declare that this complicated and wonderful organ , the eye , which gives evidence of an Almighty designer more than any thing else in creation , so far from this , proves to be a very poor specimen of workmanship in their estimation .
( Savile 1885 , pp. 52 - 53 , emphasis mine )
Here is the quote back in context :
To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances , for admitting different amounts of light , and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration , could have been formed by natural selection , seems , I freely confess , absurd in the highest degree .
When it was first said that the sun stood still and the world turned round , the common sense of mankind declared the doctrine false ; but the old saying of Vox populi , vox Dei , as every philosopher knows , cannot be trusted in science .
Reason tells me , that if numerous gradations from a simple and imperfect eye to one complex and perfect can be shown to exist , each grade being useful to its possessor , as is certainly the case ; if further , the eye ever varies and the variations be inherited , as is likewise certainly the case and if such variations should be useful to any animal under changing conditions of life , then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection , though insuperable by our imagination , should not be considered as subversive of the theory .
How a nerve comes to be sensitive to light , hardly concerns us more than how life itself originated ; but I may remark that , as some of the lowest organisms , in which nerves cannot be detected , are capable of perceiving light , it does not seem impossible that certain sensitive elements in their sarcode should become aggregated and developed into nerves , endowed with this special sensibility .
In searching for the gradations through which an organ in any species has been perfected , we ought to look exclusively to its lineal progenitors ; but this is scarcely ever possible , and we are forced to look to other species and genera of the same group , that is to the collateral descendants from the same parent - form , in order to see what gradations are possible , and for the chance of some gradations having been transmitted in an unaltered or little altered condition .
But the state of the same organ in distinct classes may incidentally throw light on the steps by which it has been perfected .
( Darwin 1872 , emphasis mine )
Darwin then continues on for several more paragraphs giving examples .
In the same sidebar we find this quotation which is from the same chapter of the Origin of Species :
L.G.
“ If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not possibly have been formed by numerous , successive , slight modifications , my theory would absolutely break down . ” ( p.9 )
This is another favorite creationist out - of - context target .
Once again here is the quote back in context :
If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed , which could not possibly have been formed by numerous , successive , slight modifications , my theory would absolutely break down .
But I can find out no such case .
No doubt many organs exist of which we do not know the transitional grades , more especially if we look to much - isolated species , round which , according to the theory , there has been much extinction .
Or again , if we take an organ common to all the members of a class , for in this latter case the organ must have been originally formed at a remote period , since which all the many members of the class have been developed ; and in order to discover the early transitional grades through which the organ has passed , we should have to look to very ancient ancestral forms , long since become extinct .
We should be extremely cautious in concluding that an organ could not have been formed by transitional gradations of some kind .
Numerous cases could be given amongst the lower animals of the same organ performing at the same time wholly distinct functions ; thus in the larva of the dragon - fly and in the fish Cobitis the alimentary canal respires , digests , and excretes .
In the Hydra , the animal may be turned inside out , and the exterior surface will then digest and the stomach respire .
In such cases natural selection might specialise , if any advantage were thus gained , the whole or part of an organ , which had previously performed two functions , for one function alone , and thus by insensible steps greatly change its nature .
( Darwin 1872 , emphasis mine )
Interestingly in the context of this quote Darwin presages the idea of exaptation or “ preadaptation “ , that structures or organs originally used for one function can , if they are no longer used for their primary purpose , be co-opted for other uses .
This principle in both morphological and genetic contexts explains many ( if not all ) of the “ irreducibly complex ” features found in living things that creationists claim are unexplainable by evolutionary means .
Next we have the claim that the only source of new “ information ” is an “ intelligent source ” :
L.G. What is the source of that information encoded in the DNA ?
Dr. Stephen Meyer points out that “ Everything we know from our uniform and repeated experience is that information always comes from an intelligent source .
So when we find information in the cell in the form of the digital code in DNA , the most likely explanation is that DNA also had an intelligent source . ” ( p.6 )
And this claim by Meyer also traces back to its “ creation science ” forbearer :
Creationists maintain that highly ordered systems could not arise by chance , since random processes generate disorder rather than order , simplicity rather than complexity and confusion instead of “ information . ”
… This means that , whenever one sees any kind of real ordered complexity in nature , particularly as found in living systems , he can be sure this complexity was designed .
( Henry Morris 1979 , emphasis mine )
Meyer ’s is doing a double bait and switch here .
First , ‘ information ’ , we as natural intelligent beings generate ( written language , computer programs etc. ) comes , in our experience , from natural intelligent sources .
If we started receiving alien sitcom reruns coming from the vicinity of Tau Ceti we would assume that the source of the signal was a natural intelligence , something like ourselves , using some technology comparable to what we use to broadcast TV and radio signals .
However , ID creationism advocates are not just calling upon their intelligent designer to create new information in the DNA of living things .
They argue that the designer set up the conditions of the entire universe .
Or as comedian Jon Stewart quipped when describing ID proponents : “ they ’re not saying its God , just someone with the basic skill set to create an entire working universe . ”
In other words they ’re not arguing for another natural intelligence like ours at all , but a supernatural intelligence of a sort that is not part of “ our uniform and repeated experience . ”
Secondly we have no experience whatsoever of biological information being generated by anything other than natural processes ( mutation and selection ) .
L.G. Dr. Michael Behe ( Professor of Biochemistry , Lehigh University ) says , “ Molecular evolution is not based on scientific authority .
There is no publication in the scientific literature — in prestigious journals , specialty journals , or books — that describes how molecular evolution of any real , complex , biochemical system either did occur or even might have occurred . ” ( p.7 )
Putting this quote in context , it was said during his direct testimony , at the Dover Pennsylvania intelligent design trial ( Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District ) .
During the trial Behe was confronted with the scientific literature on one of the complex biochemical systems that he talked about in his book Darwin ’s Black Box ( 1996 ) , the immune system .
The journal Nature published a commentary on what happened when he was cross- examined by one of the plaintiff ’s attorneys ’ on this subject :
During cross-examination by the plaintiffs ’ lead counsel Eric Rothschild , Behe reiterated his claim about the scientific literature on the evolution of the immune system , testifying that “ the scientific literature has no detailed testable answers on how the immune system could have arisen by random mutation and natural selection . ”
Rothschild then presented Behe with a thick file of publications on immune system evolution , dating from 1971 to 2006 , plus several books and textbook chapters .
Asked for his response , Behe admitted he had not read many of the publications presented ( a small fraction of all the literature on evolutionary immunology of the past 35 years ) , but summarily rejected them as unsatisfactory and dismissed the idea of doing research on the topic as “ unfruitful . ”
This exchange clearly made an impression on Judge Jones , who specifically described it in his opinion :
In fact , on cross-examination , Professor Behe was questioned concerning his 1996 claim that science would never find an evolutionary explanation for the immune system .
He was presented with fifty - eight peer - reviewed publications , nine books , and several immunology textbook chapters about the evolution of the immune system ; however , he simply insisted that this was still not sufficient evidence of evolution , and that it was not ‘ good enough . ’
We find that such evidence demonstrates that the ID argument is dependent upon setting a scientifically unreasonable burden of proof for the theory of evolution .
Other important scientific points stood out during trial relating to other purported irreducibly complex systems such as the flagellum and the clotting cascade , the nature of science itself and the lack of experimental tests and supporting peer - reviewed publications for ID .
But the stark contrast between the lively and productive field of evolutionary immunology and the stubborn refusal by ID advocates such as Behe to even consider the evidence was undoubtedly crucial in convincing the judge that the ID movement has little to do with science .
As Rothschild remarked in his closing argument , Thankfully , there are scientists who do search for answers to the question of the origin of the immune system .
It ’s the immune system .
It ’s our defense against debilitating and fatal diseases .
The scientists who wrote those books and articles toil in obscurity , without book royalties or speaking engagements .
Their efforts help us combat and cure serious medical conditions .
By contrast , Professor Behe and the entire intelligent design movement are doing nothing to advance scientific or medical knowledge and are telling future generations of scientists , do n’t bother .
( Bottaro et al. 2006 , p. )
So contrary to Behe ’s claim there has been work published in the scientific literature on the evolution of complex biochemical systems , it is just that Dr. Behe does n’t like what they have to say , or perhaps he does n’t even care .
L.G. Breeding essentially mixes and matches among all the genes in an existing gene pool , much like you would shuffle and deal a deck of cards .
But breeding cannot create new genes , any more than shuffling a deck can create new cards . ( p.7 )
Darwin did n’t even know about genetic mutations or DNA , he only spoke of variations .
And while it is true that breeding ( artificial selection ) does n’t create new genes , no one from Darwin onward ever claimed otherwise :
Man can hardly select , or only with much difficulty , any deviation of structure excepting such as is externally visible ; and indeed he rarely cares for what is internal .
He can never act by selection , excepting on variations which are first given to him in some slight degree by nature .
No man would ever try to make a fantail till he saw a pigeon with a tail developed in some slight degree in an unusual manner , or a pouter till he saw a pigeon with a crop of somewhat unusual size ; and the more abnormal or unusual any character was when it first appeared , the more likely it would be to catch his attention .
( Darwin 1872 , emphasis mine )
We now understand that mutations create new genes ( new variations ) randomly with respect to the needs of the organisms .
Natural and artificial selection , which are both non-random processes , act on these mutations to produce adaptive ( in the case of natural selection ) changes in populations over time .
L.G. Plus , selective breeding of plants and animals is a process guided by intelligence , not mere chance and survival of the fittest — unlike Darwinian evolution .
Yet Darwinists from Charles Darwin to Francis Crick to Richard Dawkins have continued to cite selective breeding as if it were a powerful example of unguided “ evolution ” ! ( p.7 )
Darwin cited artificial selection merely to show the power of selective processes to bring about morphological changes in living things and to argue that an analogous process ( natural selection ) could do likewise .
In the case of artificial selection it is the breeder who selects for some particular shape or color etc. in a plant or animal from the available variations they find in a captive population of organisms .
Those they select are bred again , the rest are weeded out .
With natural selection it is the differential reproductive success of organisms in their particular environments which “ guides ” adaptive changes .
L.G.
What about the power of mutations to promote evolution by introducing dramatic changes in an organism — like adding an extra pair of wings to a fruit - fly ? ( p.7 )
As is typical with antievolutionists they focus on large scale mutations ( macromutations ) .
While these are obvious and dramatic , they are not thought by most evolutionary biologists to play a major role in evolution compared to the smaller less obvious mutations , which all living things have in varying amounts .
L.G. Scientists are still struggling to understand the full impact of mutations on living things , but what they do know is that the vast majority of mutations are damaging to an organism or neutral .
Far less than one percent might actually be beneficial . ( p.7 )
Also from another side bar :
L.G. Mutations are almost always harmful or neutral , and those that are beneficial cannot create genuinely new genetic information . ( p.8 )
This is yet more warmed over creationist rhetoric that they have been spouting for decades :
Creationists maintain that it is extremely doubtful if a truly beneficial mutation ever occurs .
A random change in a highly complex and intricately coordinated machine could produce only disorder and loss of function .
Even if a beneficial mutation could occur , a mutation could only bring about a change in an existing characteristic and thus could not create any new trait or generate increasing complexity .
( Duane Gish 1975 ) , emphasis mine )
Something that should always be remembered is that what is deleterious and what is beneficial are not necessarily absolutes .
What might be a deleterious mutation in one environment may be beneficial in another .
Nor do mutations that might be beneficial overall necessarily come without a downside .
For example a single copy of the sickle cell gene is beneficial for people in malaria ridden areas granting them resistance to the disease and therefore allowing them to survive at much higher rates than those with out the gene .
The downside is persons born with two copies of the gene suffer from sickle cell anemia .
So the distinction between deleterious and beneficial is not always clear cut .
L.G.
So how can incomprehensibly complex organisms be the result of mutations that are rarely if ever beneficial ? ( p.7 )
This can be so because natural selection acts as ratcheting filter , weeding out the large number of mutations that are deleterious , ignoring neutral mutations that may become deleterious or beneficial in an ever changing environment , and preserving the few beneficial ( under present conditions ) mutations that do occur .
L.G. As biologist Lynn Margulis at the University of Massachusetts , Amherst , has concluded : “ New mutations do n’t create new species ; they create offspring that are impaired . ” ( p.7 )
Setting aside this particular quote from Dr. Margulis ( which comes from a newspaper article rather than a peer reviewed source ) , it is interesting nonetheless to note that they are quoting her at all .
This is because she is a good counter example to their claims that anyone who questions the “ Darwinian orthodoxy ” is subject to censure and expulsion .
You see , despite the fact that Margulis is respected for her work on endosymbiotic theory – the now widely accepted explanation for the origin of eukaryotic cells ( cells with a nucleus and organelles like chloroplastsmitochondria ) – she has significantly parted ways with the majority of biologists in her fervor to promote symbiosis as a major explanatory factor in evolution .
and
However , despite the fact that she is promoting a “ non-Darwinian ” mechanism for evolutionary change and often says unflattering things about neo -Darwinian theory , she has not been censured or expelled .
Not only is she not shunned by biologists with more traditional views but they sometimes even go out of there way to encourage the airing of her ideas in spite of their disagreement .
For example one of Margulis ’ more recent books ( coauthored with her son Dorion Sagan ) Acquiring Genomes : A theory of the origin of species ( 2002 ) , argues that random mutation is of “ marginal importance ” in evolution and that a more significant source of new genes comes via what she calls “ symbiotic merger ” .
But despite this blatant departure from standard neo-Darwinian theory the foreword of the book was written by the late Ernst Mayr ( one of the founders of the modern evolutionary synthesis ) .
Mayr makes it clear in his foreword that he disagrees strongly with many of the ideas set forth in the book but nevertheless thinks that she and her coauthor have interesting and important things to say .
This seems greatly at odds with the idea that the “ Darwinian establishment ” squelches dissent .
Perhaps it is because her ideas , though they may not be accepted by other biologists , are still natural testable hypotheses , not patently religious beliefs masquerading as science .

Members of one of Brazil 's uncontacted indigenous tribes have been photographed in a protected area of the Amazon jungle near Peru .
All pictures : Brazil National Indian Foundation ( Funai ) Funai officials said the aircraft passed over the site a number of times , and photographed " strong and healthy " warriors , women and children , six huts and a large planted area .
The first flight had an obvious impact on the tribe .
By the time the plane returned , most of the women and children had fled and those who remained had painted their bodies .
These images are all from a later pass by the plane .
The men , painted red , brandished weapons and fired off some arrows at the aircraft .
The person in black may be a woman .
The government said the images would prove those who doubted the tribe 's existence wrong .
The tribe , which has not yet been identified , is one of four different isolated groups in the region .
Funai says it does not make contact with the tribes and prevents invasions of their land , to ensure their total autonomy .
More than half the world 's 100 uncontacted tribes live in Brazil or Peru and campaigners say many face threats to their land from illegal logging .

What are these ?
Do n't miss the appearance by Florida at the end of the video ...
Ocean and sea forts are few and far between and with good reason : only in fairly extreme circumstances is their expense deemed justifiable .
Since being decommissioned , many of these have gained strange second lives as everything from luxury resorts and private retreats to micronations and pirate radio stations .
It sounds extreme , but be honest : would n’t you want a sea fort of your very own ?
Guy Maunsell is responsible for an amazing series of WWII army and navy sea forts , many of which still stand today .
One of the most infamous of his navy sea forts has since been converted into a micronation named Sealand .
Four navy forts ( shown above ) were pre-constructed and then arrayed off the coast of Britain to expand radar coverage and provide anti-aircraft fire with huge mounted guns .
So how did they put them in place ?
The base pillars were carried out by barge and then the whole structure is sunk and filled with water .
Maunsell ’s army sea forts were more specifically designed to repel smaller aircraft flying in to attack rather than to lay mines at site .
Each fort consists of a cluster of smaller units arrayed in a group .
Each group had one spotlight tower and the rest of the units had guns mounted all around to give maximum range .
Each fort was connected by bridges to the others in the cluster but was also structurally autonomous – presumably in case one were to be successfully targeted and destroyed .
Since being decommissioned , a number of these forts have been used for pirate radio broadcasting stations .
Horse Sands , Spitbank , St. Helens and No Man ’s Land Forts were created in the mid-1800s as defensive sea forts around Portsmouth .
Some are now abandoned or under private ownership but No Man ’s Land Fort has actually been converted into a luxury resort and Spitbank has been transformed into a museum , hotel and events space .
St. Helen ’s fort can actually be reached on foot during low tides at certain times of year .
At one point , a failed businessman barricaded himself in No Man ’s Land Fort to escape his creditors .
The Nab Tower , now a lighthouse , was created in 1918 near Southampton in order to protect merchant vessels from attacks by German submarines .
At 40 feet wide , 90 feet tall and a cost of over a million dollars a piece eight such towers were to be created and linked with steel nets to keep out U - boats .
In the end , only this tower was constructed and installed – one other was scrapped after being partly built .
The tower was built on a concrete based towed out to sea then filled with water so it would sink to the bottom .
However , in the sinking process the structure tilted slightly and remains at a 3 degree angle .
In 1999 , the commercial ( Dole ) ship shown above collided with the tower causing damage to both ship and structure .
New vegetarian food with several benefits
A new vegetarian food that boosts the uptake of iron and offers a good set of proteins .
This could be the result of a doctoral dissertation by Charlotte Eklund - Jonsson at the Department of Food Science , Chalmers University of Technology , in Sweden .
The food , called tempe , is moreover a whole - grain product with high folate content .
It is generally accepted in medicine that whole - grains reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases , and it is also believed that it protects against age - related diabetes and certain forms of cancer .
The B vitamin folate is the natural form of folic acid and , among other things , is necessary for normal fetal development .
“ Tempe is designed for vegetarians , but also for people who want to eat less meat for environmental reasons , for example , ” says Charlotte Eklund - Jonsson .
“ We also had the environment in mind when we chose to base it on barley and oats , which are suitable to cultivate in Sweden and therefore do not require long transports . ”
Tempe is produced through fermentation with the aid of the micro fungus Rhizopus oligosporus .
Tempe fermentation originates from Indonesia , but soybeans are used as the raw material there .
In her work , Charlotte Eklund - Jonsson developed methods to preserve the high fiber content of the cereal grains and at the same time to enhance their content of easily accessible iron .
Normally these two considerations work against each other .
The findings show that the uptake of iron doubled after a meal of barley tempe compared with unfermented barley .
In other studies both oat and barley tempe moreover produced low blood sugar responses and insulin responses , which is typical of whole - grain products .
The dissertation is titled “ Nutritional properties of tempe fermented whole - grain barley and oats ­- Influence of processing conditions on the retention and availability of iron , starch and folates ” .
俺も考えてみよう。総当たりとか近似値とかはすでにやっていらっしゃるようなので、確率方面?から。
1桁の数字は 10 個 ( 0を含めて考えてる ) あって、3の倍数は 3個。3がつく数字は、1個。重複があるので、3個。
3の倍数は、全体の 1/3 3がつく数字は… 。10の位も 1の位も 3じゃない場合を引けばいいから、1 - ( 8/9 * 9/10 ) = 1/5 → 全体の 1/5 1/3 と 1/5 で重複分があるから、1/3 + 1/5 - ( 1/3 * 1/5 ) = 7/15 全部で 100-90個の数字があるので、90 * 7/15 = 42 個。
10000〜99999 の、90000 個の数字がある。 3で割り切れる数字は、1/3個。
3がつく数字は、3がつかない数字から考えると、1 - 8/9 * ( 9/10 ) ^4 = 1 - ( 9^3 ) /( 10^4 ) 重複分があるから
、1/3 + ( 1 - ( ( 9^3 ) / ( 10^4 ) ) ) - 1/3 * ( 1 - ( ( 9^3 ) / ( 10^4 ) ) ) 。 なので、900000 * ( 1/3 + ( 1 - ( ( 9^3 ) / ( 10^4 ) ) ) - 1/3 * ( 1 - ( ( 9^3 ) / ( 10^4 ) ) ) )
3がつく数字は、3がつかない数字から考えると、1 - 8/9 * ( 9/10 ) ^4 = 1 - 8*( 9^3 ) /( 10^4 ) 重複分があるから

計算式の解説 。
yoggy さんは数に注目して計算されていますが、私はどちらかというと統計的に？確率的に？考えました。
この方式の利点は、総当たりなどをしないために
CPU パワーなどほとんど関係なく、時間もかからないこと。桁数の多い計算機があればパソコンなくてもきっと大丈夫。プログラミング言語も知らなくて
OK 。
では、計算内容です 。
(^ は、べき乗です。 )
A : 桁数です 。
B : A の桁数での、数の数 。2桁なら 、10〜99 の 90 個で、これは 10^2 - 10^1。n桁の場合は 10^n - 10 ^( n - 1 ) 。
C : 3の倍数の割合。誤差は出るがおしなべて 1/3。
D : 3がつく数の割合。たぶんここがこの方式のミソ。まず、3がつかない数を割合を求める。 n桁の場合、頭の桁は 0 はあり得なくて、3 でない数、つまり 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9 でないとダメだから、9通りのうちの 8通りがあり得る。 頭の桁以外は、3でない数、つまり
0,1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9 でないとダメだから、10通りのうち 9通り。 n桁だから、8/9 * ( 9/10 ) * ( 9/10 ) * ... * ( 9/10 ) = 8/9 * ( 9/10 ) ^( n - 1 ) が、3がつかない数の割合。 3がつく数の割合は、1- ( 8/9 * ( 9/10 ) ^( n - 1 ) ) になります 。
E : C と D の合計。ただし重複分を除く。C + D - ( C * D )
F : アホになる数の数は、総数 * 割合 = B * E。
で、ここまでは桁数ごとに計算していたので、G , H でここまでの合計を計算し 、I で割合を求めています 。
1桁の場合はハナっから誤差が出るので手計算し、2桁以上はすべて上の計算式で求めてみました。
What is dehumanization , and how does it facilitate a host of atrocities ?
How is it now influencing the debate over waterboarding ?
What is the relationship of Christianity to dehumanization , and should this ancient religion be a source of concern in our dialogue on torture ?
These are difficult questions for which I do not pretend to have all the answers , however , this post will attempt to find a starting point in a long - overdue discussion .
Dehumanization is a psychological process in which a defined enemy is perceived as less human and thus less deserving of the moral consideration one typically applies to one 's fellow human .
Classic examples include African slaves in the eyes of White Americans and Jews in the eyes of Nazis .
Contemporary examples include illegal immigrants in the eyes of socially conservative Republicans and " Islamofascists " in the eyes of fundamentalist Christians .
In most cases , dehumanization unfolds gradually , often requiring considerable time .
Hitler did not wake up one morning and decide , " Hey , let 's blame everything on the Jews . "
Antisemitism had a long history in Germany before Hitler , as it was a lingering relic of medieval Christianity .
However , it is also possible to accelerate this process when a mass tragedy can be blamed on a particular group .
Persons of Arabic descent living in America experienced this in the aftermath of 9/11 .
The impact of dehumanization is that the normal barriers to mistreatment begin to fall until few remain .
Atrocities which would be unimaginable if they were committed against one 's own group slowly become acceptable when used against the dehumanized outgroup .
Even acts which have widely been considered criminal when perpetrated against one 's own people may become permissible against the outgroup .
After all , they are monsters , bent on our destruction .
Extreme measures are now justified to deal with them .
As the psychological distance between us and them grows , our restraints fall .
Most humans agree that torture ranks up there with genocide at the top of the list of the worst things of which we are capable .
We afford humans at least some basic rights and recognize that torture violates these rights .
We examine the Golden Rule and conclude that we should not torture , as we would not want to be tortured or to see our loved ones tortured .
And yet , it is fairly easy to overcome this moral sense through dehumanization .
This is not a typical enemy .
They are determined to do us harm , and our very lives are at stake in this conflict .
They are motivated by things we cannot comprehend .
In short , they are evil .
As evil beings , they engage in behaviors which no moral human could justify .
We must do whatever is necessary to protect ourselves and our way of life .
Eventually , we may come to view longstanding prohibitions on torture as quaint or inapplicable .
The worst atrocities we can imagine become not just permissible but even morally required to win the great conflict .
By dehumanizing the enemy , we legitimize violence and remove barrier after barrier to extreme methods .
We can justify torture or even genocide .
Most important , we can eventually reach the point where no justification seems necessary .
The world becomes divided between good and evil .
That which is evil must be opposed by any means necessary .
Progressive Christians want to emphasize the " love your neighbor " and " turn the other cheek " aspects of their religion , while fundamentalists stress " an eye for an eye " and images of Jesus bringing the sword .
But both groups are share the belief that Christian morality is superior to all other forms .
The fundamentalists may be more up front with this belief , but it can be found among the progressives too ( see this post for more information ) .
When those who embrace Jesus are perceived as being better people than those who do not , we have an entryway to dehumanization .
The Christian bible teaches that god has a chosen people who are favored above all others .
This jealous god routinely kills those who disobey his commands and leads his followers in the destruction of multiple outgroups .
When god is on one 's side , one can do now wrong and one is has a certain moral superiority over all others .
The bible teaches Christians that non-Christians are evil , admonishing them to kill nonbelievers and persons who worship other gods .
In contemporary America , the military is infused with fundamentalist Christianity .
This is no accident .
Soldiers who are convinced that they are defending Christian values against the threat of Islam will have fewer restraints on the battlefield .
After all , the enemy refuses to acknowledge the " truth " of Christianity , so how moral can they be ?
The propaganda aimed at the American people consistently blends " Islam " with " terrorism , " " extremism , " or " fascism . "
We are told repeatedly that our values and entire way of life are under attack .
When observers complain that the American Christians hurling these insults are themselves extremists and fascists , we should be reminded that psychologists have long known that dehumanization typically involves some projection ( i.e. , one 's own faults are projected onto the enemy ) .
Dehumanization is a necessary prerequisite of atrocities such as torture and genocide .
To engage in such crimes against humanity , one must come to regard one 's victims as somewhat less human .
Christianity , despite the many good things some Christians do , facilitates dehumanization through the doctrine that Christians are morally superior to non-Christians .
By viewing nonbelievers or persons of other religious traditions and lost , immoral , or even hell bound , Christianity opens the door to the dehumanization of non-Christians .
The current American leadership , neo-cons bent on American imperialism , is well aware of this and has forged alliances with Christian extremists with this in mind .
Here are the accounts of three scientists who have lost their asterisks .
Dr. Peter Libby , chief of cardiovascular medicine at Harvard ’s Brigham and Women ’s Hospital , said that when he first began receiving offers from drug companies , in the early 1980s , they seemed like a natural reflection of his burgeoning reputation .
“ When you start emerging as an opinion leader or as a researcher who has knowledge and expertise , the pharmaceutical industry takes an interest in either having you consult to help them with their research or to speak , ” he said .
Dr. Libby wanted to assist .
Like many scientists , he feels that it is important for researchers to consult with drug companies to help develop therapies and set up studies .
He never owned stock in companies that he consulted for .
He always disclosed the fact that he consulted and spoke for companies .
And , he added , he thought that he was protected from accusations of favoring any particular company ’s products because he consulted for so many .
“ I lived safely in that comfort zone for many years , ” Dr. Libby said .
Then he was hit with a moment of truth .
He had spent four years working without pay to help create a public television series , “ The Mysterious Human Heart . ”
The project was , he thought , a worthy effort to educate the public about what heart disease was and how to prevent it .
He was proud and pleased when the series was broadcast in October .
But to his dismay , bloggers immediately attacked him and the other medical experts who appeared on the programs for having consulted for manufacturers of pharmaceuticals and medical devices , Dr. Libby said , adding : “ They said we were biased .
What I thought was four years of public service was impugned .
“ That was a wake - up call for me .
I was singed in the blogosphere . ”
This year , he made his decision .
He would continue speaking at forums sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry and would continue consulting for companies .
But he would no longer accept payment .

Since then , Dr. Libby said , company executives and lawyers have asked whether they offended him .
Does he have some secret agenda ?

WHAT if someone invented a better mousetrap and the world yawned ?
Until now , that has been the fate of Jay Harman , an Australian naturalist who believes that he ’s found a way to use fundamental properties of physics and biology to improve the design of everything from simple fans and pumps to hydroelectric dams and aircraft .
Almost every piece of machinery in the physical world has efficiency limits related to the flow of liquids and gases : pumps consume energy to move liquids ; the amount of fuel used by airplanes and cars is based on their aerodynamic efficiency ; and fans and wind turbines both consume and generate energy based on the efficiency of the shape of their rotating blades .
As a young boy , Mr. Harman saw that objects in nature seemed to abhor traveling in a straight line .
Fluids and gases flow in languid spirals , and although he was not trained as a scientist , it struck him as obvious that there was a profound lesson in that motion .
Ultimately , he turned the source of his childhood fascination into something he believed would be practical .
He surmised that he could exploit his observations about fluids to change the shape of propellers , fans and virtually anything that needs to move in a fluid or gas environment .
Cyanothece is a unicellular bacterium that can capture energy from light and also fix atmospheric nitrogen .
As part of a daily diurnal cycle , Cyanothece stores the products of photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation so that they can be used at the proper time .
This ability makes Cyanothece an ideal system to understand how a unicellular organism balances and regulates complex processes in the same cell .

Researchers at Washington University in St. Louis have gained the first detailed insight into the way circadian rhythms govern global gene expression in Cyanothece , a type of cyanobacterium ( blue - green algae ) known to cycle between photosynthesis during the day and nitrogen fixation at night .
In general , this study shows that during the day , Cyanothece increases expression of genes governing photosynthesis and sugar production , as expected .
At night , however , Cyanothece ramps up the expression of genes governing a surprising number of vital processes , including energy metabolism , nitrogen fixation , respiration , the translation of messenger RNA ( mRNA ) to proteins and the folding of these proteins into proper configurations .
The findings have implications for energy production and storage of clean , alternative biofuels .
The study was published in the April online issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science .
The research was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy in the context of a Biology Grand Challenge project administered by the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory .
Bacterial biological clock
" One of the mysteries in cellular physiology is this business of rhythm , " said Himadri Pakrasi , Ph.D. , the George William and Irene Koechig Freiberg Professor in Arts & Sciences and lead investigator of this project .
" Circadian rhythm controls many physiological processes in higher organisms , including plants and people .
Cyanothece are of great interest because , even though one cell lives less than a day , dividing every 10 to 14 hours , together they have a biological clock telling them when to do what over a 24 - hour period .
In fact , cyanobacteria are the only bacteria known to have a circadian behavior . "
Why does such a short - lived , single - celled organism care what time it is ?
The answer , according to this study , is that the day - night cycle has a tremendous impact on the cell 's physiology , cycling on and off many vital metabolic processes , not just the obvious ones .
Among the obvious cycling processes are photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation .
It is difficult for one cell to perform these two functions because the processes are at odds with one another .
Fixing nitrogen requires nitrogenase , a catalyst that helps the chemical reaction move forward .
Unhelpfully , the oxygen produced by photosynthesis degrades nitrogenase , making nitrogen fixation difficult or impossible in photosynthetic organisms .
Other filamentous cyanobacteria perform photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation in different , separate cells .
As a single - celled bacterium , however , Cyanothece cannot separate these antagonistic processes in space .
But it can separate them in time .
Agreeing with previous studies , this study found that Cyanothece genes for photosynthesis turn on during the day and genes for nitrogen fixation turn on at night .
The surprise is the tremendous impact the day - night cycle has on the overall physiology of the cell .
" It goes far beyond just the aspects of nitrogen fixation and photosynthesis , " said Pakrasi , who also directs Washington University 's International Center for Advanced Renewable Energy and Sustainability ( I - CARES ) to encourage and coordinate university - wide and external collaborative research in the areas of renewable energy and sustainability — including biofuels , carbon dioxide mitigation and coal - related issues .
The university will invest more than $ 55 million in the initiative .
Cyanothece 's ' Dark Period '
To see the effect of day - night cycles on the overall physiology of Cyanothece , lead author Jana Stöckel , Ph.D. , Washington University post - doctoral researcher , and other members of this research team examined the expression of 5,000 genes , measuring the amount of messenger RNA for each gene in alternating dark and light periods over 48 hours .
At a given time , the mRNA levels indicated what the cells were doing .
For example , when the researchers identified high levels of many mRNAs encoding various protein components of the nitrogenase enzyme , they knew that the cells were fixing nitrogen at that time , in this case , during the dark periods .
Of the 5,000 genes studied , nearly 30 percent cycled on and off with changing light and dark periods .
These particular genes , the study found , also govern major metabolic processes .
Therefore , the cycling of mRNA transcription , Pakrasi said , " provides deep insight into the physiological behavior of the organism — day and night . "
During the day , Cyanothece busies itself with photosynthesis .
Using energy from sunlight , carbon dioxide from the atmosphere , and water , Cyanothece produces glucose , a sugar it stores in glycogen granules , filling its chemical gas tank .
At night , the Cyanothece ramps up production of nitrogenase to fix nitrogen , as expected .
Since nitrogen fixation requires a lot of energy , Cyanothece uses the glycogen stored through a process called respiration .
Because respiration requires oxygen , the cells conveniently use up this by - product of photosynthesis , likely helping to protect nitrogenase from degradation .
Through this cyclic expression of genes , Cyanothece is essentially a living battery , storing energy from the sun for later use .
This feat continues to elude scientists searching for ways to harness sunlight and produce energy on a large scale .
With this in mind , a new project for the Pakrasi team seeks to use the machinery of Cyanothece — its energy storage strategy , its anaerobic conditions that protect important enzymes — as a biofactory to produce hydrogen from sunlight , the ultimate clean energy source .

The dolphins that died after becoming beached in Cornwall had ingested debris and mud , leading one of the scientists who examined some of the corpses to compare their deaths to a " mass suicide " .
Vic Simpson , who has been involved in the postmortem examinations of some of the 26 dolphins that died , said yesterday : " On the face of it , it looks like some sort of mass suicide - but the question is why ?
" The dolphins had swallowed and inhaled big chunks of mud from the estuary .
Their lungs and stomachs were full of it .
That is very bizarre indeed . "
Simpson , who founded the Wildlife Veterinary Investigation Centre in Truro and is examining the dolphins on behalf of the Zoological Society of London , added : " We have seen strandings on beaches , sometimes with five to seven dolphins , but never on a scale like this . "
Dozens of common dolphins were found at four sites at the river Percuil in south Cornwall on Monday .
Rescuers were able to usher some back out to sea , but 26 could not be saved .
There are several theories , one of which is that the dolphins may have been upset by some sort of underwater disturbance .
The Royal Navy was operating nearby at the time of the beachings .
There had been live firing and a submarine had been in the area .
The Ministry of Defence also said one of its vessels had been using short - range sonar to scan the seabed .
But a spokesman said the trial was 12 miles off Falmouth and added : " It is considered extremely unlikely that this operation could have affected the mammals in any way .
" We take our environmental responsibilities very seriously and always carry out an environmental impact assessment before putting energy in the water . "
Other theories suggest the dolphins may have been frightened by a killer whale or that they had suffered some sort of infection .
It is not thought they became trapped after chasing fish into shallow water , because the stomachs examined were not full of fish .
The idea of dolphins committing suicide is a controversial one .
In Iran last year 152 dolphins washed up on the coast , leading people there to claim they killed themselves .
But most scientists believe this is an example of anthropomorphism .
Liz Evans - Jones , a zoologist at the Natural History Museum , said : " Whales and dolphins strand themselves for a number of reasons and we 're not sure yet what happened with these dolphins .
" There has not been a mass stranding in Cornwall since November 2001 , when 16 common dolphins were spotted floating dead out to sea just off Looe . "
Well , it was hard to see this one coming .
A new L.A. Times / Bloomberg poll just released on the website found that 24 % of likely Pennsylvania voters thought more highly of Barack Obama after his handling of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright controversy , while 15 % said they thought less of him .
The vast majority -- 58 % -- said it made no difference .
The poll was conducted in the next three states to hold primaries -- Pennsylvania on April 22 , and North Carolina and Indiana on May 6 .
In Indiana , reaction to Obama 's handling of the controversy were slightly reversed , with 23 % saying they thought less of him and 20 % saying they thought more highly .
But 56 % said it had no effect .
In North Carolina , 27 % said they thought more highly , 20 % said they thought less of Obama and 51 % said it did n't matter .
And in what can only be seen as a message to the superdelegates who will likely decide who gets the Democratic nomination , majorities in all three states said they believe the superdelegates should back whichever candidate won the popular vote in the superdelegate 's state .
So much for the " vote your heart " argument .
There 's some other interesting morsels in there too -- such as Obama closing to within five points of Clinton in Pennsylvania , though the poll was conducted April 10 - 14 while the " bitter " controversy was playing out .
Obama also had a five - point lead in Indiana , a Rust Belt state that should be playing to Clinton 's strength among working - class voters , and a 13 - point lead in North Carolina .
The leads in Pennsylvania and Indiana were within the poll 's margin of error .
Another surprise :
The number of undecideds .
In Pennsylvania , 12 % said they still did n't know for whom they were voting , a category that jumped to 19 % in Indiana and 17 % in North Carolina .
That means in each state the undecideds exceeded the gap between the two contenders .

ALBANY , New York ( CNN ) --
At the age of 21 , Christopher Jenkins appeared to have everything going for him .
The University of Minnesota senior was good - looking , had a near perfect grade - point average and had a future in business .
Christopher Jenkins , 21 , vanished on Halloween 2002 .
Four years later , police ruled his death a homicide .
Then , suddenly , he vanished .
He was last seen celebrating Halloween at a bar in downtown Minneapolis , Minnesota , in 2002 .
Jenkins ' friends said he left about midnight .
Four months later , his body was found in the Mississippi River , still wearing his Halloween costume .
Minneapolis police classified the drowning as accidental .
Jenkins ' blood - alcohol level was well above the legal limit , and police told his parents that he'd probably had too much to drink after bar - hopping with friends .
They thought he 'd fallen into the river .
Despite a lack of evidence , his parents , Steve and Jan Jenkins , insisted that there had been foul play .
" He was loaded into a vehicle , a van , driven around and eventually murdered , " Jan Jenkins told CNN .
" He was murdered and thrown away like a piece of trash . "
Hundreds of miles away , Kevin Gannon , a retired detective with the New York Police Department , was investigating the mysterious deaths of several college men from New York state .
Each of the deaths had been ruled an accidental drowning .
Watch how clusters of drowning deaths raise suspicion »
In 2006 , nearly four years after Jenkins died , there was a break in the case .
A tip from a man in jail , described by Minneapolis police as a witness or suspect , caused police to change Jenkins ' cause of death from " unexplained drowning " to homicide .
It was a lucky break for Gannon .
He had promised the parents of Patrick McNeill that he would n't quit until he'd found out how the Fordham University student died .
McNeill 's body washed up in the East River two months after he left a bar in New York .
Gannon enlisted the help of another former NYPD officer , Anthony Duarte , when Christopher Jenkins ' death became a homicide .
In 2003 , the two traveled to Minneapolis to investigate Jenkins ' death .
They learned about a string of student drowning deaths , many of them involving young men who attended colleges along the Interstate 94 corridor in the Midwest -- in Minnesota , Wisconsin and Iowa .
Nine of the deceased attended the University of LaCrosse , in Wisconsin .
Three attended colleges in New York state .
In all , the investigators say they 've connected the bizarre drowning deaths of at least 40 college - age men across the country .
The two detectives believe that in each case , and in others they investigated , the men were drugged and then their bodies were slipped or tossed into the water to make it appear as if they 'd drowned .
Do n't Miss AC 360 Blog : Investigating ' the Smiley Face killer '
Why would the killer or killers put the bodies in the water ?
The effect of water on evidence makes for an almost perfect crime , Duarte said .
Not only does it make it appear like an accidental drowning instead of a murder , but the water frequently washes away key pieces of evidence such as fingerprints and fibers , so the killer can't be identified .
Together , the two detectives began mapping out the drowning deaths and working the case backward .
Instead of focusing on where the bodies had been found , they used GPS devices and tracked river flow patterns and water levels to figure out where the bodies entered the water .
As Gannon and Duarte investigated the deaths , they began to see a trend .
The cases spanned 25 cities in 11 states , and at least some of them were connected by a creepy symbol left near the water 's edge : a smiley face painted on trees and other surfaces .
The detectives believe that the smiley faces were left by the killer or killers .
They varied in size , with each face more haunting than the next .
The most sinister was found in Iowa .
It was drawn in red with a devil 's horns .
Next to the smiley face was a note that read , " Evil Happy Smiley Face Man . "
Asked whether he believed there was a hidden message in the smiley faces , Duarte told CNN , " The message is , they 're taunting the police . "
Duarte and Gannon said they found 12 other matching symbols similar to gang graffiti .
But , to protect their investigation , they would n't describe them in detail .
The detectives say the string of deaths could be the work of more than one killer because some of them took place on the same day in different states .
" It 's so widespread .
We have so many different victims in so many different areas , " Duarte said .
" It would , in my view , be impossible to be one person . "
The detectives also believe the victims were targeted .
All of the young men were popular , athletic and good students .
Who would commit this type of crime ?
" The type of person that would be the opposite , not smart , someone not good in school , maybe does n't have a job , not popular , " Duarte said .
Gannon and Duarte believe that the young men were drugged to weaken them and given a substance that could n't be detected by an autopsy .
" I believe these young men are being abducted by individuals in the bars , taken out , at some point held for a period of time before they 're entered into the water , " Gannon said .
He also believes the victims were abused mentally and sometimes physically before they were killed .
" This is a chance for them to have power and control over somebody else and manipulate .
The fear of death is just as important as the act of death itself , " Gannon said .
Minneapolis police are not convinced that Jenkins ' death was the work of a serial killer .
" Although we have collaborated with investigators from the FBI and communicated with other jurisdictions in which similar drowning deaths have occurred , we can neither confirm nor endorse the ' smiley face murders ' theory currently being publicized , " the department said .
The FBI also has its doubts .
" To date , we have not developed any evidence to support links between these tragic deaths or any evidence substantiating the theory that these deaths are the work of a serial killer or killers .
The vast majority of these instances appear to be alcohol - related drowning , " the bureau said in a statement .
Still , Gannon and Duarte are concerned that the killing could continue .
They say whoever killed Jenkins might already be stalking other college students .
" Unless you 've been out there to the scenes to evaluate [ them ] yourself , if you have n't done that , you 're basically Monday - morning quarterbacking , " Gannon argued .
Duarte thinks local police forces did not investigate the cases adequately and that the FBI could have done more , too .
" I do n't think any of them went out to the field and beat the bushes , " he said .

Obama allies hit Penn
Change to Win , the labor federation that includes SEIU , just sent out a statement demanding Penn 's head :
The statement , from executive director Greg Tarpinian :
It 's time for Sen. Hillary Clinton to send her vaunted ' chief strategist ' Mark Penn packing — back to his job consulting for union busting corporations and anti-labor governments for good .
Continued after the jump .
" We have questioned Penn 's role in the Clinton campaign in the past for his representation of union busting employers like Cintas .
At that time , Penn said there was a wall between him and his firm 's representation of union busters .
The latest revelation that Penn -- whose firm represents the Colombian government in its effort to secure passage of a so - called free trade agreement -- is actively involved in securing its passage in the middle of Senator Clinton 's presidential campaign is outrageous .
It also suggests that he has been playing a double role - advising the Senator on what to say to curry Democratic voters and advising the Colombian government on what to say to curry a majority of votes in Congress .
" The vast majority of Americans do not believe that we should be granting preferential trade status to a government that coddles death squads that target union organizers .
Colombia remains the most dangerous country in the world for union members , where more than 2,200 workers have been murdered since the 1980s by Colombian death squads for trying to form unions while the government has done nothing to effectively stop the murders .
It is time for Penn to go . "
BANGKOK  Myanmar ’s military junta promised on Friday to allow into the country “ all aid workers ” of any nationality , after three weeks of blocking most assistance to cyclone victims , the United Nations secretary general , Ban Ki-moon , announced .
Mr. Ban ’s statement was met with surprise and wariness by relief officials here and American officials in Washington , not least because the pledge was delivered on the eve of an international donors ’ conference in Myanmar this weekend .
While the junta has largely ignored international criticism of its response to the May 3 storm , which left some 134,000 people dead or missing , it is asking for $ 11.7 billion in reconstruction money .
That is nearly Myanmar ’s annual gross domestic product .
Mr. Ban did not release details of his discussions with the junta or say whether it was now promising a free flow of volunteers and what aid officials say is desperately needed relief .
Israeli minister confesses to genocidal intentions in Gaza .
31 Gazans massacred in 2 days to prove it , including babies and children .
I am sickened by the upsurge in Israeli murders of Palestinians and denounce it with the strongest possible feelings of my heart .
31 souls at least have been killed by the IDF since Wednesday , 2 days ago .
Since Wednesday , 31 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli missile strikes , including 14 civilians , among them eight children , according to Palestinian officials .
The youngest was a 6 - month - old boy , Mohammed al - Borai , whose funeral was held Thursday .
http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jD4YSkDPlclqd9dHvg2f0Ij18zEgD8V3I9KG0
Those killed include a 13 month old girl :

and a 6 month old boy as seen in this heart - wrenching story :
http://electronicintifada.net/v2/article9345.shtml
with several other children being killed as well , including 4 boys playing soccer and another onlooker :
Twelve people , including four children under 12 , were killed in new Israeli air raids on the Gaza Strip last Thursday .
The four boys were playing in a refugee camp .
Israel ’s all too familiar spin claimed that they were among the “ militants ” .
http://www.arabnews.com/?page=7§ion=0&article=107359&d=1&m=3&y=2008
This horrible violence is taking place while the world stands by , barely whimpering in protest .
At the same time Israel grows bolder and bolder .
We see this as Matan Vilnai , deputy defence minister in Israel let slip what Israel is truly trying to do to Gaza .
He said , “ The more qassam fire intensifies and the rockets reach a longer range , they ( the Palestinians ) will bring upon themselves a bigger shoah ( holocaust ) because we will use all our might to defend ourselves . ”
http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/02/29/wholo129.xml
Is n’t that refreshing .
It sheds light on the true relationship between Israel ( the new Nazis ) and Palestine ( the new Jews ) as one involving genocide .
Thanks Vilnai , now we know Israel ’s intentions at least .
This in spite of a recent poll in the Haaretz showing that 64 % of Israelis want their government to talk with Hamas to negotiate peace .
Sixty - four percent of Israelis say the government must hold direct talks with the Hamas government in Gaza toward a cease - fire and the release of captive soldier Gilad Shalit .
Less than one - third ( 28 percent ) still opposes such talks .
http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/958473.html
Meanwhile , the USA continues to confound the world with its support of Israel in their murders :
In Tokyo , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice met briefly with Olmert .
She said the Hamas rocket attacks “ need to stop , ” but also expressed concern for the humanitarian situation in Gaza and urged calm on all sides .
“ We have to remember that the Hamas activities there are responsible for what has happened in Gaza – the illegal coup that they led against the legitimate institutions of the Palestinian Authority , ” she Rice told reporters after the meeting .
“ It is very clear where this started . ”
http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/7345092
Of course , this is a bold - faced lie .
Hamas was the elected authority and it was Fatah that illegally voted for a new government against the principles and guidlines of the Palestinian Constitution .
It is nice of her to express concern for the humanitarian situation in Gaza , but her words mean nothing .
Noone ’s words mean nothing unless they condemn the brutal Israeli murders in the strongest terms possible .
There has been some fear among the Democratic Jewish voting block that Barack Obama will not pimp well enough for Israel of late .
He has sought to allay their fears and seeks to build their confidence in him with this interview statement :
I know how much Israelis crave peace .
I know that Prime Minister Olmert was elected with a mandate to pursue it .
I pledge to make every effort to help Israel achieve that peace , although I will not try to dictate its terms .
The principles that will guide me are 1 ) that Israel ’s security must be guaranteed ; 2 ) that the status quo is unsustainable over time , and the best long - term guarantee of Israel ’s security is a negotiated two - state solution with the Palestinians , if it can be achieved ; and 3 ) that Israel has to remain a Jewish state and the Palestinian state must be viable .
But success is not guaranteed .
Israel must have confidence that the Palestinian leadership is both committed to peace and is able to follow through on its commitments .
So the approach we have to take with respect to negotiations is that you sit down and talk , but you have to suspend trust until you can see that the Palestinian side can follow through .
That is a position I have consistently taken and will take with me to the White House .

Can you feel the hypocrisy oozing from his lips as he sells his soul to the devil ?
This is the man who once sat at the same table as Edward Said !
He says Israel must be recognized as a Jewish State !!!
I suppose he was censored then when he said that the minority Arab population within Israel ’s borders can just go to hell then as second class citizens who do not hold the rights of the Jewish majority .
Why does a secure Israel matter so much more than a secure Palestine ?
Who has less security now ?
Should n’t we even out the playing field and grant more security to Palestine ?
Barack Obama will be a failure as a President in the middle - east .
Ralph Nader is the only one who is currently speaking good sense on this issue .
I ’ll end here today with these insightful words from Tariq Al - maeena
While in Jerusalem recently , the US leader outlined his two - state vision that , critically translated , means the recognition of Israeli West Bank colonization , the preservation of Israel ’s right to discriminate against non-Jews , and the creation of more sealed - off , “ autonomous ” Palestinian homelands .
This is in sharp contrast to the recent impatience demonstrated by the Americans and the EU to amputate a portion of a UN member state and accede to the demands of the Kosovar Albanians , who after having enjoyed almost nine years of UN administration and NATO protection , could n’t be expected to wait any longer for their freedom , while the Palestinians , under a brutal occupation for over 40 years , are told that “ any Palestinian independence , to be recognized and legally effective , must still be directly negotiated , on a wildly unequal bilateral basis , between the occupying power and the occupied people — and must be agreed to by the occupying power . ”
This clearly demonstrates that for the US and the EU , the rights and wishes of a long - suffering and brutalized people , as well as international law , are irrelevant and these governments have shown unlimited and remarkable patience when it comes to condoning the occupation of Gaza and the West Bank .
Virtually every legal resident of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip seeks freedom from occupation — and has for over 40 years .
For doing so , they are punished , sanctioned , besieged , humiliated and , day after endless day , killed by those who claim to occupy the moral high ground .

In my experience , there is a shortcut to most things in life .
Exams can be crammed for , interviews bluffed and deadlines renegotiated .
I even blagged my driving licence on my third attempt , by convincing the instructor he would rather watch me perform a three - point turn than a parallel park .
Can the same be said about marathon running ?
Might there be an easy way to haul oneself through 26.2 miles without enduring the months of hardship – blisters , sore muscles , early morning runs and exhaustion ?
The short answer is : not quite .
Preparing for an endurance event such as the London Marathon , which I am running on Sunday , does take a certain level of dedication and determination , the two key elements I felt I was lacking .
Oh , and fitness .
But after a little frantic digging I discovered some corners could be cut : conventional marathon training advice generally advocates 16 to 22 weeks of heavy mileage , running five or six times a week , and loading up on carbohydrates to pump your muscles full of extra energy to expend during the race itself .
I have boldly flaunted this method , repeatedly tried - and - tested by millions of marathon runners .
Instead , I have been focusing on short , high - intensity workouts to build core and upper - body strength , combined with a long run each weekend .

Marathons are bad for you
I want to shirk the running through general laziness , but the fitness expert I find to back this plan has a more sensible reason for cutting back .
" Running for an hour every day puts your body under so much stress that it begins to break down , " says Mike Weeks .
He should know : though his interest in fitness was kicked off by a passion for rock - climbing , in 2006 he and his partner , Bean Sopwith , undertook the challenge of dragging Jack Osbourne around the Marathon des Sables , a seven - day , seven - marathon race across the Sahara .
Weeks ran three marathons a week in training and saw his connective tissue and muscle density drop away .
" You 'd have to put a gun to my head to make me run for more than a couple of hours , " he says .
" So many people think running the marathon will make them healthy , and it 's quite the opposite .
Many people leave it to the last minute and then think : ' Shit .
I 've got to start cramming in . '
Their body is just annihilated in the training . "
Weeks has a good track record in rehabilitating worn out Ironmen .
" They want us to train them harder but we get most of them to stop doing any exercise apart from strength training for 10 or 12 weeks .
Usually most of them are so weak it 's unbelievable to think they are athletes in their prime . "
The training plan
I first hit upon the idea of running the marathon in mid-January .
I head out for a 12 - mile run , out of shape and wearing old trainers , and come back with my first running injury .
A large swollen pillow of fluid has ballooned under my left knee , and I can barely straighten my leg , never mind continue with the running programme I had found on the internet , which would have me running six days a week .
Weeks takes one look at me and decides I should spend my first weekend of training lying in bed eating jelly – the secret weapon of all injury - free athletes , apparently .
Over the next two weeks I get started on some light exercise – a few three - mile jogs , some interspersed with a few minutes of running at an increased tempo ( known in the business as fartleks ) , and some gruelling sessions with Weeks of lunges , sit-ups and press-ups ( girl press- ups , with my knees on the floor ) , some weight - lifting and lots of bobbing around on a Swiss ball .
After two weeks I am ready to start running slightly longer distances , and kick off with seven miles .
Before the run , I do a session of circuits , the idea being to cram some high - intensity training into 20 minutes or half an hour , thus avoiding too many long and dull runs .
A further two weeks and countless bowls of jelly later , I start training proper : three days on , followed by a rest day .
The sessions are between 30 and 50 minutes each , and involve such joys as going for walks with a 5 lb dumb - bell in each hand , doing lifts and raises as I go and getting lots of amused looks from passers - by .
I also get to play with the TRX suspension kit , innocent - looking nylon straps that we attach to a tree in the park .
Doing push - and pull - and sit - up - style exercises while gripping the straps forces muscles you do n't know you have to spring into action to maintain your balance .
Still a weakling , I pull something in my side , and even eating hurts a bit for the following week .
Diet and equipment
Finding it painful to eat throws up new challenges , as Weeks has decreed I eat every two hours , following a strict diet of 40 per cent protein , 30 per cent fat and 30 per cent carbohydrate , determined by a lengthy questionnaire .
His suggested snacks include a rye cracker smeared with a thick layer of butter followed by an even thicker layer of pâté .
If I want to drink wine , I should eat some cheese beforehand .
Smoothies ( health drinks , surely ? ) he labels as : " Junk .
Very well - marketed bottles of insulin and cortisol - raising sugar . "
Apparently my hormonal system is in tatters and my adrenals fatigued , which means that where most people rely on adrenaline once they begin to tire ( ie , after running 10 miles or so ) , I have few extra resources to fall back on .
So he directs me to a company called Solgar , and demands I take a cocktail of their herbal supplements and vitamins .
I have never taken a vitamin before and am cynical when it comes to loading up on capsules and pills instead of just eating well , but three or four weeks after taking an omega - 3 fatty acids supplement , my hips , knees and neck have stopped clicking every time I move .
Equipment - wise , Weeks directs me to Profeet , where I spend a pretty tedious hour running and watching videos of myself running , and looking at high - tech graphics of my " bilateral anterior distal knee pain " .
Profeet makes a special pair of insoles moulded to my feet to even out the pressure .
The traditional approach
I turn to Andy Dixon , editor of the marathon geek 's bible Runner 's World magazine to compare notes .
Dixon , 35 , joined the magazine last year , and like me is running his first marathon on Sunday .
He says there is no failsafe way to train .
" Listen to your body , " he advises .
" If you 've got feet like lead , there 's no point trying to force it . "
He does advise taking on a lot of carbohydrates in the three or four days leading up to the marathon .
" The lifestyle changes of training for the marathon , " he says , " will counteract any damage you do during the race itself . "
The final furlong
Ten weeks after signing up to Weeks ' training schedule , certain benefits are quite startling .
I sleep so soundly that even if I only get four or five hours , I wake feeling refreshed .
Eating regularly and keeping my blood sugar steady has done wonders for my concentration and work efficiency .
Previous training for half marathons has given me tired and sore legs ; this time they have n't felt worn out at all .
The one sticking point , which I challenge him on repeatedly , is Weeks ' insistence I pump iron and pig out on protein : I fear I will end up looking like a champion shot - putter .
Whingeing gets me nowhere , though , as his only concern is getting me marathon - fit in the least painful way possible .
To be honest , being able to do chin-ups is kind of cool .
Two weeks before the event I do my final long training session : 35 minutes of hard circuits and an 18 - mile run .
Weeks estimates , in my opinion somewhat generously , that the circuits are the equivalent of an 8 - mile run – at his pace , maybe .
I do not think I can move one more inch after the 18 miles and collapse on my doorstep for a good 10 minutes .
Still , I ran it in two hours and 45 minutes .
The London Marathon 's director , David Bedford , laughs when I explain my training plan to him .
" I assume you do n't think you 're going to be able to run the whole way ? " he says , rather uncharitably .
He revises this opinion when he hears I have run 18 miles .
" In truth , [ weight training ] is better than doing nothing , but if you 'd spent that time running you would be in better shape than you are . "
I disagree .
This Sunday , we 'll find out who 's right .
Sophie Morris is running the marathon for VSO .

Marathon training the easy way
Mike Weeks is not against running , provided you are in good shape and keep it to 30 - or 40 - minute runs , a few times a week .
Here are his top training tips :
1. Check that your body is ready to undertake some serious training .
Is your breathing OK ?
Are you drinking enough water ?
Are you sleeping well ?
Make sure your diet suits you .
2 . Sign yourself up for circuits a couple of times a week .
If you lack motivation , see if your gym offers circuit classes .
3. Kettle bell workouts .
These funny - looking weights are one of the secrets of Eastern Bloc strongmen .
Studies show regular lifting can improve the performance of running , sprinting and pull - ups .
4 . Find a friend and do some full - body , functional sports , such as martial arts or climbing .
5 . Work up a sweat doing 25 - minute fartlek runs .
6. Yoga .
Fringe benefits include adding years to your life and feeling happy all day .
7 . Buy yourself a bike and go mountain biking , or for a gentler countryside outing .
8 . If you live in a city , escape it with a long hike .

Getting ready for race day
David Bedford , 58 , is the race director of the London Marathon and a former 10,000 m world record holder and Olympiad .
He ran in the first London Marathon in 1981 after a heavy night of drinking , a curry in the early hours and just an hour of sleep .
He does n't recommend this approach , saying " the second half of the marathon was probably the worst experience of my life " .
Here are his tips for beginners .
" It is too late now to do any additions to your training .
It is very much more about managing what happens on the day .
Keep your alcohol content low and try to get extra sleep , because on Saturday night you will be nervous and excited and will have difficulty sleeping .
" The key is not to start too fast .
Be realistic about what time you think you can do for the full marathon and go through to halfway at a slower pace , to make sure you get there feeling good about the experience .
Then you can speed up if you 've got it .
If not , you 've got more chance of maintaining your speed and getting to the finish line . "
HRSC High - level Data Products Available
6 February 2008
The High - Resolution Stereo Camera ( HRSC ) on Mars Express comprises nine channels that together in a single pass collect multicolour images of the Martian surface and at multiple angles , allowing stereo colour images to be produced from single orbit observations .
The new DTMs and ortho-images are Level - 4 data products of the HRSC and the work for deriving them from the lower level HRSC data is split between DLR and FU Berlin .
The newly released DTMs are based on HRSC data from the first six months of the Mars Express mission and together cover about 12 % of the Martian surface .
The ortho-images have been made using the information from the DTMs .
They are corrected for viewing angle and show the surface as viewed from directly overhead for each point in the image ( a map projected ortho - rectified nadir image ) .
The ortho-images are therefore only available for those regions covered by the DTMs .
Access to the HRSC data products
The Level - 4 HRSC data products are publicly available and can be accessed at three different sites ( see also the related links in the right - hand navigation ) :
ESA Planetary Science Archive ( PSA )
http://www.rssd.esa.int/index.php?project=PSA
HRSCview - joint site by FU Berlin/ DLR
http://hrscview.fu-berlin.de/
NASA Planetary Data Science ( PDS )
http://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/missions/mars_express/
As of 5 february the ESA PSA contains the Level - 4 data products of the first six months of the Mars Express mission .
The HRSCview archive contains also more recent DTMs from later orbits which will be integrated later in batches in the ESA and NASA planetary archives .

There was no immediate claim of responsibility , but Indian government officials -- including Minister of State for Home Affairs Shriprakash Jaiswal -- were quick to label it a terrorist attack .
The eight explosions started at about 7:30 p.m. ( 1400 GMT ) and detonated within 12 minutes of each other , police said .
The bombs exploded within about 500 meters ( 0.3 mile ) of each other in Jaipur 's old city , which is frequented by tourists .
See the aftermath of the explosions . »
An ninth bomb was defused , according to H.G. Raghavendra , a Jaipur city official .
He described all the bombs as " medium intensity . "
" There is no reason to panic , " he told CNN - IBN .
" Everything is under control . "
One blast struck near Hanuman Temple , which was crowded with Hindus worshipping Hanuman , the religion 's monkey god .
Another struck near a market area inside Jaipur 's walled city where tourists and locals frequent restaurants and shops .
Jaipur , known as the " pink city , " is about 260 kilometers ( 160 miles ) southwest of India 's capital , New Delhi .
Many of the casualties were taken to SMS Hospital , the largest government hospital in Jaipur .
People gathered outside the hospital to hear news about friends and relatives ; the hospital issued an urgent appeal for blood donations .
The state of Rajasthan , where Jaipur is located , was placed on alert , local officials said .
Delhi police officials said they too were on high alert after the blasts and were receiving regular updates from Jaipur on developments in the investigation .
The Deputy Chief Minister for the state of Maharashtra , R.R. Patil , said the entire state was also on high alert .
Mumbai is in the state of Maharashtra .
The attack was immediately condemned by the United States .
U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said the attacks were " quite clearly an act intended to take innocent lives . "
He told reporters at his daily briefing that Washington was still collecting information , and could not " offer insight into who may be responsible . "
According to the U.S. State Department , India ranks among the countries where terrorism is most common .
" The conflict in Jammu and Kashmir , attacks by extreme leftist Naxalites and Maoists in eastern and central India , assaults by ethno- linguistic nationalists in the northeastern states , and terrorist strikes nationwide by Islamic extremists took more than 2,300 lives this year , " the agency said .
It said India 's counterterrorism efforts " are hampered by outdated and overburdened law enforcement and legal systems , " and described the country 's court system as " slow , laborious , and prone to corruption . "

" The welfare of humanity is always the alibi of tyrants . " ~ Albert Camus
The dessert in a jar thing came at me in a few different ways .
First was the mention of cakes baked in a jar over at Angry Chicken , and then with pretty frosting at Super Eggplant .
What a brilliant present , an already baked cake all sealed up and ready to eat .
Later I came across these pies baked in jars at LloydAndLauren .
Little pies , which you construct in jars and freeze to bake later so you have individual freshly baked pies basically on demand .
This is genius .
I was overcome with the need to make my own immediately .
Above , just out of the freezer .
Below , just out of the oven .
First I bought a box of 4 ounce jars from a Fred Meyer store .
I do n’t recall what I was originally thinking when I bought 4 ounce jars instead of the more reasonably sized 8 ounce jars that Lauren used , but I think it went something like this : “ ooh , cupcake sized pies ” .
I used Kerr brand , quilted jelly jars .
Please note the importance of using jars with straight sides that do n’t narrow at the opening , ok , thank you .
I dug out the recipe for Cook ’s Illustrated Foolproof All - butter Pie Pastry ( listed in the second post there ) .
Next I ’ll try the Foolproof Pie Dough that uses vodka , thanks to Smitten Kitchen for typing out the recipe .
The all - butter recipe ?
Yum .
I bought some cherry pie filling in a can because , I will not lie , I am lazy .
Here are a few things I learned :
When putting in the bottom crust allow it to stick up over the edge to give you something to turn under and crimp later .
I do n’t have nearly enough crust in the picture above to do the job right .
My second batch , which I did n’t take pictures of , had properly tucked crust and did n’t leak nearly as much .
When you do leave enough crust they look more like this ( one from my second try ) :
photograph by Maggi , thanks Maggi !
Put filling in to about 3/4ths of an inch below the top .
This way you ’ll have enough room to put the top layer of crust on and press the edges together .
There is no really good way to get a small disk of pie dough into the jar and press it into place .
I sort of made a cone to lower the dough and just smooshed everything into place , trimming a bit off where needed .
I used aspic cutters to make tiny shapes in the crust , I did this with the small pies made in muffin tins as well .
Fold over and crimp the edges as best you can , it ’s pretty difficult in such a small jar .
Better yet , use a larger jar .
Bake somewhere between 350 and 400 degrees until the bottom of the crust is browning , an advantage of baking in a glass container .
The top might pop off or puff up adorably .
Putting a Silpat on your baking sheet keeps the little jars from sliding around when you remove them from the oven , they are otherwise frighteningly slidy and hot .
Do n’t forget to take the lid off before you put them into the oven !
If you only put one hole in the crust they might erupt like a volcano .
Removal from the jar is a little messy .
Just go with it .
Cherry held up better than apple as a filling with enough flavor to stand out in such a small amount .
I did n’t get a chance to try blueberry .
Yet .
Depleted uranium should , perhaps , be the ammunition of choice for duck hunters .
That 's the conclusion of a study called Response of American Black Ducks to Dietary Uranium : A Proposed Substitute for Lead Shot .
The recommendation , published in 1983 in the Journal of Wildlife Management , has not been much disputed .
The study 's authors , biologists Susan Haseltine and Louis Sileo , were based at the Patuxent Wildlife Research Centre in Laurel , Maryland .
Lead shot is dangerous for ducks , especially if it hits them .
When it does n't hit a duck ( or another hunter , as sometimes happens ) , the shot falls into the wetlands .
The lead leaches into the muck , slowly poisoning any ducks that have managed to avoid being shot .
In many hunting areas , lead shot is verboten .
At the time of the study , steel was being touted as the best alternative to lead .
But Haseltine and Sileo pointed out its drawbacks .
" Steel shot shells are more expensive than lead shot shells when purchased in a retail outlet , " they wrote .
" They can not be used in all guns and have not been well received by some hunters , who question their performance on ducks and geese . "
Haseltine and Sileo credit the idea of substituting uranium for steel to the metallurgist Dr Carl A Zapffe of Baltimore , Maryland .
Zapffe was no slouch about steel : witness his 1948 study Evaluation of Pickling Inhibitors from the Standpoint of Hydrogen Embrittlement : Acid Pickling of Stainless Steel .
Zapffe also wrote a book disputing Einstein 's theory of special relativity , but that is a separate matter .
Haseltine and Sileo listed what they call the " attractive characteristics " of depleted uranium as a raw material for making birdshot .
" In its pure form , " they wrote , " it is denser than lead and , in alloys , might be made to produce shot patterns and velocities attractive to hunters and within the effective range for waterfowl .
Depleted uranium can be alloyed with many other metals and its softness and corrosiveness can be altered over a wide range . "
But nothing is perfect .
" Negative aspects for potential uranium shot include pyrophoricity [ proneness to spontaneously burst into flames ] problems with pure depleted uranium , which can be altered by alloying , and the expense of separating depleted uranium from other nuclear waste products . "
Their main argument was that uranium may not be very poisonous even to a duck that , of its own accord , swallows some in pellet form .
That is what Haseltine and Sileo sought to verify .
They fed 40 ducks a diet of commercial duck mash salted with powdered depleted uranium .
None of the ducks died of it , or got sick , or even lost weight .
Moreover , the researchers reported , the ducks " were in fair to excellent flesh " when slaughtered .
And so they enthused that " further examination of this metal as a substitute for lead in shot is justified " .
However , no one has yet followed up on this in a big way for hunting anything other than people .

One of the things I sometimes fiddle with in the back of my head is how to fix school curricula to better serve students and society .
One of the stronger ideas I have is that economics ( and ideally , game theory ) should be taught , replacing a lot of really dumb mathematical holdovers like trigonometric identities for a semester or two .
And over the last few weeks , I 've been really wishing that we'd been teaching economics for the past fifty years instead of other silly things , because the blinding stupidity on exhibit in the recent oil debates is really starting to get to me .
Economics is a complicated and rich subject , but you can get a lot of mileage out of just understanding the basics , which can be condensed down to :
Money is real - it may be a consensual societal hallucination but it is also real .
Money buys real energy , buys real goods , buys real time and human labor ; it is therefore something real and not entirely subject to the vagaries of human desire .
The cost of a good is an effect of the difficulty of making it , not a cause .
All else being held equal ...
Increases in supply will result in lower prices .
in will result in .
Decreases in supply will result in higher prices .
in will result in .
Increases in demand will result in higher prices .
in will result in .
Decreases in demand will result in lower prices .
All else not being equal , the market will tend to find an equilibrium point naturally .
Fiddling with the natural market equilibrium by ... artificially raising prices , or equivalently , artificially reducing supplier costs will cause an artificial surplus , as suppliers are encouraged to produce beyond demand .
, or equivalently , will cause an artificial , as suppliers are encouraged to produce beyond demand .
artificially lowering prices , or equivalently , artificially raising supplier 's costs will cause an artificial shortage , as suppliers can't provide the same amount of goods economically and will turn their attention elsewhere .
It 's worth saying this again : Money is real .
That 's why these are the " laws " of economics .
These laws represent real people , real value , and real transactions .
Attempts to break the laws of economics can be easily translated to showing that you are trying to get something for nothing , or believing that you can come out ahead by expending more resources that you are bringing in .
No exceptions .
That 's it , that 's economics in a nutshell .
Learning about all the other fun stuff can be useful and even important , but this simple set of statements can take you a long way .
So , tell me :
Why are do many of the solutions to high gas prices being proposed in Congress involve reducing supply ?
Why ?
Why ?!?
Thinking that reducing supply will reduce prices is objectively stupid .
And similarly , why is raising supply considered anathema ?
Why do Democrats basically accuse it of being political razzle - dazzle ?
The political razzle - dazzle is being performed by those who are convincing people that raising supply wo n't affect prices !
Taxing gas companies for their " excessive profits " is artificially raising their cost for extracting oil .
This will reduce supply and raise prices .
Any other attempts to penalize the oil companies will have the same effect .
The only solutions are to directly reduce demand , which is n't possible , or raise supply .
You can indirectly end up with demand reduced in a new equilibrium involving higher prices , but that 's not the same thing .
Raising supply is the only way to go .
Please note I 'm deliberately ignoring the complicated issue of whether we should reduce gas prices .
That 's a separate issue from the question of how we would go about getting lower prices if that 's what we decide we want .
I 'm just talking about the blinding incompetence being demonstrated with regard to the question of how one reduces prices .
The rocketing price of a barrel of oil has prompted American Airlines to make swingeing cuts to its aircraft fleet , workforce and timetable in a sign of the severity of the cost storm gathering over the global aviation industry .
The world 's largest airline intends to scrap 75 planes and will reduce the number of seats available on domestic routes by between 11 % and 12 % this year .
An unspecified number of jobs will be lost from AA 's 85,000 - strong payroll as the airline closes and merges facilities .
The downsizing is AA 's sharpest since the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11 2001 .
On Wall Street , the company 's shares plunged by 16 % to a three - year low of $ 6.93 .
Speaking at AA 's annual meeting in Texas , chief executive Gerard Arpey said : " The airline industry as it is constituted today was not built to withstand oil prices at $ 125 a barrel , and certainly not when record fuel expenses are coupled with a weak US economy . "
Airlines around the world are struggling to cope with oil prices which have pushed the cost of aviation fuel to record levels .
Each increase of $ 10 in a barrel of oil means a cost of $ 800 m ( £ 406 m ) for AA - which means that the commodity 's surge since the start of the year has raised the airline 's annual costs by $ 3bn .
" Our company and industry simply cannot afford to sit by hoping for industry and market conditions to improve , " said Arpey .
Experts believe that AA 's downsizing will be merely one of many belt - tightening moves by air carriers .
British Airways ' board has examined a scenario in which the £ 883 m pre-tax profit falls to zero this year .
Japan Airlines has raised fuel surcharges on its tickets by 40 % citing an " unprecedented increase " in the price of fuel .
Ryanair 's boss , Michael O'Leary , today admitted that oil was " really hurting " and that his low - cost carrier " certainly wo n't make a lot of money " if the price of a barrel stays over $ 125 .
Chris Tarry , an aviation industry analyst , said : " Here you have an industry that has the potential , if nothing changes to current oil prices , to lose $ 40 bn this year . "
He said the impact was " several magnitudes greater " than the downturn in international travel which forced several US airlines into bankruptcy after terrorists struck the World Trade Centre : " Airlines have not been particularly successful in recouping the price of fuel . "
Fierce competition has made it difficult for carriers to raise headline fares .
Many are trying to claw back revenue through supplementary fees - AA announced that it was imposing a $ 15 charge for checking in bags , although this will not be levied on international passengers .
The aircraft to be retired by AA are largely regional jets which burn more fuel per passenger than larger planes .
Transatlantic services , which are relatively profitable , are unlikely to be significantly trimmed - AA said its international capacity will fall , at most , by 0.5 % .
Roger King , an analyst at CreditSights in New York , told Bloomberg News that the carrier 's cuts may not be drastic enough : " When oil is this high and they 're bleeding this much cash , you have to shrink to a core market that is profitable . "
As they scramble to reduce costs , other airlines are reducing flying speeds andcutting the weight of aircraft - measures have even included removing magazine racks and altering drinks trolleys to make them lighter .
The US airline industry recently called on the Bush administration to tap the nation 's reserve supplies of home heating oil in order to bring down the price of fuel .
Top carriers are exploring mergers to cut costs - Delta Airlines is planning a combination with Northwest Airlines , while United Airlines has held talks with US Airways .
Fuel costs have contributed to several airlines going bust .
Recent casualties include the all - business transatlantic carriers MaxJet and Eos , together with Hawaii's Aloha Airlines and the US carrier ATA .
In Europe , Alitalia is relying on financial support from the Italian government to keep flying .
Kevin Crissey , an airlines analyst at UBS , said in a research note : " The industry needs to shrink in a huge hurry to be able to raise fares and reduce fuel burn and other expenses . "
Oil is becoming an increasingly contentious political issue .
Executives from leading oil companies including BP , Shell and ExxonMobil were accused of taking advantage of consumers ' pain during a hearing by the senate judiciary committee in Washington today .
" The president once boasted that with his pals in the oil industry , he would be able to keep prices low , " said senator Patrick Leahy , a Democrat from Vermont .
" Instead , it is his pals in the oil industry who have benefited . "
I was walking earlier today thinking to myself , " you know , say what you will about John McCain , but he 'll almost certainly be a better President than George W. Bush so we have something to look forward to no matter what happens in America . "
Then I thought to myself that to write that up , you 'd need to include the all - important to - be - sure sentence .
Specifically , something like " if , that is , he manages to avoid any catastrophic new wars that lead to massive bloodshed . "
Then you read something about how Michael Goldfarb is leaving The Weekly Standard 's blog to go join the McCain campaign , and you recall that that 's a giant to - be-sure .
Some folks take comfort in the fact that up until 1998 - 99 or so McCain had reasonably reasonable views about foreign policy , but he 's been way out in crazy - land for years now and all indications are that his administration will be staffed by neocons too fanatical or dim-witted to have served in the Bush administration and been discredited .

Bibliography and Index
Important Note !
The title of this book , which seems to cast aspersions on the competence of professors , is misleading .
The author submitted a dozen or so more appropriate titles but the publisher was intransigent .
Obviously he wished to trade on the name of his earlier publication WHY JOHNNY CAN'T ADD , which had wide recognition .
As the author 's wife and sometime secretary , I can testify that Morris Kline was keenly unhappy with the publisher 's choice .
This book is not an attack on professors but is rather a wide - ranging critique of undergraduate education .
Indeed an appropriate , less jazzy title would have been A CRITIQUE OF UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION .

Some people hear colors , see flavors and are generally prone to a mixing - and - matching of typically disparate perceptual domains .
Those people are called synesthetes , and were the topic of a World Science Festival talk delivered last night by neuroscientist extraordinaire V.S. Ramachandran .
Where does synesthesia come from ?
Maybe synesthetes are just lying .
Perhaps they 're under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs – many research subjects are college kids , after all – or happened as children to play with colored alphabet blocks .
Or maybe they 're simply good with metaphors .
To Ramachandran , the latter answer gets at the truth – but he stressed that what appears as metaphor is a literal sensory experience for synesthetes .
That may explain , he said , why synesthesia is eight times more common among poets , artists and novelists than the general population .
The essence of art is , arguably , metaphor , and its practitioners are especially prolific – and metaphor is just a convenient shorthand for the connection of unlinked cognitive phenomena .
That 's exactly what appears to happen in the minds of synesthetes .
Far - flung parts of their brain have unusually high levels of cross-wiring .
For people of a poetic bent , this is quite useful :
You get to tell your date that her eyes glow like the moon , hair ripples like the ocean and skin is smoother than a friendly corporate takeover .
( Fine , I 'm not a poet . )
But life was n't always so romantic .
The arts are a latter - day human characteristic , one that requires a certain amount of security and stability to flourish .
So how did it develop ?
To help our ancestors climb trees , said
Ramachandran .
Doing so requires a vision - informed mental map of the branches before us , as well as a touch - informed mental map of our limbs ' positions .
Somehow these have to correlate .
Which is quite a trick , when you think about it .
Once early primates pulled off that feat of abstraction , it was n't long
\– evolutionarily speaking – before we were drawing on cave walls and whispering sweet nothings and holding Shakespeare revivals .
But just because you do n't have the urge to eat the color purple does n't mean you 're not a synesthete .
" We are all synesthetes , to some extent , " Ramachandran said , then administered this handy test to the audience : Look at the shapes in this picture .
Imagine that one is named " kiki " and the other " booba " .
Which is which ?
If the shape at right strikes you as kiki and booba's at left , then you 've got some synesthesia going on , said Ramachandran .
To most of us , the jaggedness of the shape on the right corresponds to the abruptness of the phonemes in kiki , while the shape on the left resonates with the rolling vowels of booba .
But wait – does the sharper shape look like a booba to you ?
Well , that does n't necessarily mean you 're incapable of metaphor .
But just to be on the safe side , you might want to avoid strenuous tree - climbing .

Mungkin anda sendiri adalah serong yang baru dalam dunia judi bola onlin dan masih awam dalam pertaruhan sepak bola online , namun yang pasti adalah orang yang bertaruh pada judi bola online jelas pastinya juga menyukai olahraga bola sepak .
Dan karena sebuah keamanan anda tentang taruhan sepak bola online maka ada baiknya anda untuk mempelajari dan memperdalam pengetahuan anda tentang sepak bola .
Anda juga bisa mempelajari beberapa langkah - langkah ampuh yang nantinya bisa anda gunakan untuk dapat memprediksi sepak bola .
Secara umum , untuk panduan memasang bet , mengenali beberapa jenis taruhan , dan cara permainannya pastinya anda sudah mengetahui .
Untuk itu , dalam artikel ini akan dipelajari beberapa teknik dalam memprediksi bola secara akurat .
Langkah - langkah untuk dapat memprediksi taruhan bola sebagai berikut :
ADALAH NILAI PUR / VOOR BAIK DAN BENAR
Biasanya , jika berada tim raksasa yang pada saat itu melawan sebuah tim kecil di dalam sebuah pertandingan uji coba maupun dalam pertandingan babak penyisihan grup , maka untuk minimal voor yang diberikan adalah 2.5 poin untuk bola .
Namun terkadang juga ada tim bola papan atas yang memberikan sebuah nilai kurang dari itu .
Jika bisa anda cermati secara seksama , sebenarnya nilai pur tersebut sangatlah janggal .
Kejanggalan tersebut terletak pada nilai pur yang nilainya lebih besar , padahal kita semua tahu pertandingan bola sendiri merupakan hal dengan berjuta kemungkinan .
Jika nantinya anda menemukan nilai pur yang menurut pemikiran adam adalah suatu hal yang janggal , maka untuk itu silahkan tunda untuk memasang taruhannya lebih dahulu .
biasa saja taruhan tersebut nantinya malah akan merugikan anda dan bisa saja hal tersebut mengandung factor yang jauh membuat anda rugi dan bisa saja juga terjadi match fixing .
Mencermati sebuah nilai pur sangatlah penting adanya , dan nantinya hal ini akan membuat anda lebih unggul ketika memiliki sebuah pengetahuan mengenai kemampuan masing - masing tim yang nantinya akan bertanding .
Bagi anda sendiri yang belum tahu apa itu pur , pur / voor atau pur-puran sendiri adalah sebuah nilai yang diberikan oleh bandar pada jenis taruhan HDP dan juga O/U , dimana pur sendiri berfungsi sebagai salah satu poin untuk menyeimbangkan taruhan .
Yakni membuat tim yang biasanya merupakan tim besar yang dianggap lebih unggul dan akan memberikan hasil dan poin yang cukup besar atau dapat memberikan poin lebih dulu sebelum pertandingan dimulai kepada sebuah tim yang dianggap lebih berpeluang untuk mengalami sebuah kekalahan .
POSISI HOME / AWAY
Nah , anda harus tahu tim mana yang biasanya jago kandang dalam bermain .
Mengapa dalam membuat sebuah prediksi hal ini juga menjadi salah satu faktor penting yang kedua , atmosfer di lapangan sendiri itu mampu menambah daya tempur bagi sebuah tim tanpa sadar .
Semakin semangat ketika seseorang bermain , maka nantinya tenaga dan juga performanya akan jauh lebih meningkat .
Jadi , ketika nantinya anda memperhitungkan sebuah pertandingan sepak bola , langkah awal dan juga factor awal yang bisa anda ambil sebagai penilaian adalah posisi tandang dan atau kandang .
Hal ini bisa sangat pengaruh besar saat anda sendiri menginginkan sebuah kemenangan dalam bertaruh judi bola .
Jadi , pastikan saja sendiri untuk keuntungan yang mungkin saja terjadi , hal tersebut bisa jadi pilihan bagus untuk membuat anda dapat memilih dengan tepat .
RESULT / HIGHLIGHT PERTANDINGAN MASING -MASING
TIM
Pengecekan yang lainnya yang juga tidak kalah penting yang dapat anda coba sebagai penentu anda menang kalah adalah hasil pertandingan pekan sebelumnya sebuah tim yang nada pasang .
Masing - masing tim pasti juga memiliki sebuah jadwal pertandingan sebelumnya , dari situs yang anda cari bisa dilihat beberapa poin penting sebagai penilaian .
Yaitu mulai dari performa pada masing - masing pemain , kemampuan bagaimana seorang striker , dan yang penting adalah solidnya atau kerjasama antar pemain .
Dengan mencermati hal - hal seperti berikut , anda diharapkan bisa mendapatkan banyak sekali kesempatan untuk dapat memastikan kembali pilihan yang anda pilih .
Jadi jangan selalu untuk memperhitungkan berdasarkan dengan rumor , isu dan juga hal yang biasanya hanya bersifat entertainment .
Tetapi anda juga harus melihat sebuah fakta di lapangan dan jila and menjadikan beberapa hal di atas sebagai salah satu referensi anda kemungkinan untuk memilih taruhan yang luar biasa dapat anda menangkan .
DATA STATISTIC TERBARU H2H
Satu lagi dalam sebuah analisa yang juga tidak boleh ketinggalan yang harus anda lakukan , dan penting sekali untuk membuat sebuah keputusan berjudi semakin tajam dan juga akurat .
Ini adalah salah satu yang juga sangat penting sekali , yaitu pentingnya statistic , dimana statistic sendiri adalah sebuah referensi terbaik yang dapat anda gunakan .
Sebuah data lengkap yang biasanya berisikan jumlah gol , posisi bola , dan juga jumlah sanksi kartu , jumlah gol setiap tim , waktu , dan juga performa setiap tim .
Data statistic tersebut sangat penting sehingga nantinya juga perlu dipadukan dengan h2d atau head to head .
H2h sendiri adalah sebuah riwayat dari pertemuan kedua belah tim yang sudah berkali - kali terjadi .
Dan juga hal ini mencakup riwayat dari hasil seluruh pertandingan ketika kedua tim tersebut berlaga , dan dengan head to head sendiri nantinya anda bisa dapat menarik sebuah kesimpulan .
Bahkan mitos yang telah beredar sendiri di dalam pertandingan sepak bola maupun juga liga sepak bola selalu bersumber dari sebuah head to head .
LEVEL CLUB , LEVEL PEMAIN & SIKAP
Level sebuah klub sepak bola sendiri menjadi sebuah penentu untuk kemungkinan menang , apalagi level dari pemain juga tiap kali menjadi sebuah nilai plus sendiri dalam permainan .
Hal tersebut juga dapat menjadi kemungkinan kalah atau menang .
Namun karena bola sendiri itu bundar tidak menentu sebuah kemungkinan kalah dan menang dapat ditentukan oleh keberuntungan sebuah tim .
Tetapi level saja juga tidak menjadi sebuah pengaruh makanya dimasukkan ke dalam faktor yang menentukan prediksi .
Demikian pembahasan tentang faktor yang dapat menentukan anda untuk dapat memprediksi sebuah skor dalam taruhan bola online .
Sebenarnya jika anda bisa menerapkan beberapa hal tersebut sebelum anda mulai bermain judi bola online pastinya anda juga akan memperoleh sebuah kemenangan .
Selamat mencoba !
Thank you for interesting in Who Owns Teachable !
I have been working on a detailed video to explain you the latest information about this …
So until that video comes …
I recommend you to watch this video that is related to the topic .
In my opinion , its strength is with video - driven content .
And , Teachable also shines when it involves simple tools that help to support selling courses – like , for instance , it ’s customizable sales , checkout , and many thanks pages .
It ’s also worth noting that Teachable is one among the most important , if not the most important player in its class of platforms .
this is often a crucial point given the massive number of companies that have rushed in to undertake to sell online course platforms .
tons of them are going to be gone within a few of years .
I do n’t think Teachable will .
As far as pricing goes , Teachable still offers a free plan at the time i’m posting this review .
Under this plan there are not any limits on courses or students , but you are doing pay $ 1 plus a tenth transaction fee whenever you sell a course .
Paid plans currently start at $ 39 per month ( $ 29 if paid annually ) .
With rock bottom level paid plan you continue to pay a 5 % transaction fees on all sales .
Transaction fees disappear once you jump up to subsequent level .
Since pricing and related features can change pretty frequently , I encourage you to go to the Teachable site to match the varied plans that are available .
Now , let ’s start taking a glance at the Teachable experience intimately .
Creating Online Courses with Teachable
An important a part of an honest Teachable review – or the other online course platform review – may be a check out how easy it ’s to make online courses within the platform .
In Teachable , fixing a course is pretty straightforward .
One of the primary things that struck me within the Courses area of the executive panel is that Teachable is clearly geared toward selling courses .
As a part of the set - up process for a course you specify basic items the name of the course and therefore the instructor , but you ’ll also specify an enquiry engine optimized ( SEO ) URL , page title and meta - description for every course you create .
You can also easily upload a thumbnail image which will be displayed within the catalog and on the course interface also as a promotion video which will be displayed on the sales page for the course .
Of course , before you begin selling , you ’ve got to possess something to sell .
Teachable ’s approach to course creation is fairly basic , in my opinion , and definitely favors on - demand , video - based courses .
Still , this is often likely to be sufficient for many online course creators .
Course are organized as Sections crammed with Lectures .
Who Owns Teachable , you name the sections as you set them up ( e.g. , Introduction , First Module ) and , if you would like , you ’ll use the Custom Text feature discussed above to exchange the word “ lecture ” with something more to your liking .
Lectures can contains multimedia files ( video , audio , PDF , etc ) , text that you simply type directly into Teachable , quizzes , or any combination of those .
There is also an “ Add Code ” option for Lectures that you simply can use to embed live video streams or webinars directly into a lecture .
this is often a pleasant option , though likely too advanced for many course entrepreneurs – it might be nice to ascertain a more user - friendly option for streaming video and Webinars .
Finally , there ’s a “ Drip ” option that permits you to publish lectures over a period of your time supported the amount of days after your students enroll .
( Requires Basic plan or above ) Aside from the “ Add Code ” feature , i feel most online course creators will find it pretty easy to line up a course in Teachable , and therefore the final product looks attractive and professional .
Keep in mind that one among the key features of Teachable is that you simply can create Authors who then have the rights to try to to most of what I describe above – also as earn a revenue share from sales of the courses they create .
So , if you would like to line up a Teachable site then have multiple people create some or all of the content , Teachable makes that pretty easy to manage .
Before wrapping up this section , i would like to hide some areas that Learning Revolution readers often inquire from me about . : quizzes , certificates , and therefore the ability to import course made in course authoring software like Articulate or Captivate .

Sure , Philippe Starck may not care for the Kindle , but an open letter posted on Amazon 's front page suggests he's in the minority .
We already knew that the company was having a difficult time filling orders , but we had no idea the wait for buyers would warrant what amounts to a public apology from Jeff Bezos .
Apparently , the online superstore is drawing heat for six - week delays on delivery for some customers , and is scrambling to get itself into an " order today , ship today " scheme .
The original release of the device sold out in just 5 1/ 2 hours says the letter , which might explain why no one is hacking it -- no one has it .
[ Thanks , Michael ]
It 's not enough for everyone on earth to have a single mobile phone — Real Networks CEO Rob Glaser thinks that everyone will eventually have at least two .
Glaser spoke at this week 's Mobile World Congress Conference in Barcelona , insisting that it was n't possible for a " do everything , no compromise " device to exist and serve people 's every mobile need .
Glaser explained that his belief was fueled by differences in input methods , size , and functionality between devices .
No single phone can do everything easily , he said , which is why the public will be driven to carry multiple devices .
" Mobile penetration wo n't stop at 100 percent , " he told the crowd .
" It will go to 200 percent because the notion of a single device that does it all is n't the way ( the market is ) going to go . "
Do most people really need two phones ?
Yes , the mobile landscape is n't perfect , even with the continued introduction of increasingly capable devices .
And it 's true that there are some people who do already carry around more than one mobile device because they need different functionalities from each one , but those people are still a minority .
The general public ( at least in the US ) is still just getting up to speed with the concept of a smartphone that can do more than just make and receive phone calls — give your average Joe an iPhone or a BlackBerry Pearl and he 'll be beyond satisfied for a long time to come .
Arguably , mobile customers ' willingness to embrace devices that can't quite do everything they want leads them go purchase multiple devices in the first place .
Manufacturers ( and the carriers who love them ) are still falling short on the user experience front , as evidenced by another panel held at Mobile World Congress .
Called " It 's the User Experience , Stupid , " the panel cited recent survey results that showed exceptional user satisfaction with the newly - launched iPhone , and pointed out that the industry could benefit from emulating that experience elsewhere .
Panelists agreed that user experience with other devices has not been very good — data prices , content , and ease - of - use are major hurdles that need to be overcome .
No one wants to carry around more stuff than they need to ; instead we do it out of necessity because the situation is still so unsatisfactory .
( For example , Jon Stokes proudly declared last September that he carried around three separate mobile devices .
He has since become an iPhone user even though he still has plenty of room in his manpurse . )
If the mobile industry does a better job of creating capable devices , easy - to - use software , and understandable ( and affordable ) data plans , Glaser 's prediction is unlikely to come to fruition .

The little girl was waist - high , so small that the lawyers , clerks and judges hurrying through the courthouse almost missed her .
As lunchtime arrived and the crowds of noisy men and women cleared away , a curious judge asked her what she was doing sitting alone on a bench .
“ I came to get a divorce , ” 10 - year - old Nujood Ali told the jurist .
Her impoverished parents had married her off to a man more than three times her age , who beat her and forced her to have sex , she explained .
When she told her father and mother that she wanted out of the marriage , they refused to help .
So an aunt provided her with bus money to travel to court and seek a divorce .

Within days of that April 2 encounter , Nujood ’s tale and the plight of child brides in Yemen made international headlines .
And thanks to the efforts of human rights lawyer Shada Nasser , who took up her cause , the girl at the center of the story has begun to overcome her trauma and dream of a better life .
Yemeni law sets the age of consent at 15 .
But tribal customs and interpretations of Islam often trump the law in this country of 23 million .
A 2006 study conducted by Sana University reported that 52 % of girls were married by 18 .
Publicity surrounding Nujood ’s case prompted calls to raise the legal age for marriage to 18 for both men and women .
Yemen ’s conservative lawmakers refused to take up the issue .
But the case sparked public discussion and newspaper headlines .
Several more child brides came forward , including a girl who sought a divorce last week in the southern city of Ibb .
“ This case opened the door , ” Nasser says .
Advertisement
Nujood says that at first , she felt ashamed about what had happened to her .
“ But I passed through that , ” she says , eyes narrowing beneath her black head scarf .
“ All I want now is to finish my education , ” she adds , her mouth curling into a smile .
“ I want to be a lawyer . ”
The girl is being identified in this story because her name already has been widely publicized in Yemen , and neither her parents nor her lawyer objected .
Nujood ’s unemployed father , Ali Mohammed Ahdal , has two wives and 16 children .
He is among the many tribal Yemenis who have migrated to the capital looking for work .
Instead , he found misery .
Advertisement
He arranged to have Nujood married in February to Faez Ali Thamer , a thirtysomething motorcycle deliveryman from his native province , Hajja .
Nujood ’s parents say they were trying to do what was best for their daughter and did n’t even receive a dowry , a claim many Yemenis do n’t believe .
The parents say the groom had promised he would n’t have sex with her until she reached puberty .
“ We asked him to raise her , ” said Shuaieh , the girl ’s mother .
The groom has disputed that claim .
Advertisement
Ahdal , in his mid-40s , says he wanted Nujood to avoid the fate of two of his older sisters .
One was kidnapped by a rival clan and another wound up in jail for trying to defend her , an example of the murky intertribal disputes that bedevil Yemen .
“ I was trying to protect her , ” Ahdal says during an interview in his family ’s decrepit two - room flat on the capital ’s outskirts .
Nujood looked forward to getting married , not understanding what it really meant .
Aside from being a pre-adolescent bride , she is a fairly typical little girl .
She likes playing hide - and - seek and tug - of - war with her friends and siblings .
Her favorite colors are red and yellow , she says , and her favorite flavors are chocolate and coconut .
She loves dogs and cats and dreams of being a turtle so she could swim in the sea .
“ I ’ve never seen the sea , ” she says .

About 40 people attended the wedding in the village of Wadi Laa , where the groom lived .
As a wedding gift , she received three new dresses and a $ 20 wedding ring .
She was to live with him and his family .
The trouble started on the first night , when he demanded that they share a mattress .
She resisted , walking out of the room , only to have him follow .
Sometimes he beat her into submission .
For weeks , she cried all day and dreaded the nights , when he would enter the room , blow out the oil lamp and demand sex .
“ I asked him not to sleep next to me , ” she recalls .
“ He told me , ‘ No , we sleep together in the same room .
Your father agreed to accept me as a husband . ’ ”
On a visit weeks later to her parents ’ house in the capital , she wept , saying that her husband was doing unmentionable things to her .
Advertisement
Her father said there was nothing he could do .
“ My cousins would have killed me if I dishonored the family by asking for a divorce , ” he said .
But her mother ’s sister discreetly advised her to go to court .
The bewildered judge who found Nujood on the bench decided to bring her to his house for the weekend .
His daughters had a swing and toys she ’d never seen .
They had satellite television , and for three days she feasted on cartoons .
Advertisement
Once the workweek began , the judge dispatched soldiers to arrest Nujood ’s father and husband .
He placed Nujood in the care of an uncle , her mother ’s brother .
Still , the lawyers and judges had no idea how to handle her case .
Nujood and her uncle languished in the courthouse for days until a middle - aged woman , the only one in the courthouse without an Islamic headdress covering her face , approached them .
“ Are you Nujood ? ” asked Nasser , the lawyer , among Yemen ’s leading women ’s rights activists .
“ Are you the one asking for divorce ? ”
She was , Nujood replied .
Advertisement
“ I could n’t believe my eyes , ” Nasser says .
The girl reminded her of her own daughter , Lamia , 8 .
Nasser went to the cell where Thamer , the husband , was being held , and was shocked by the age difference between the two .
“ Why did you sleep with her ? ” she demanded .
“ She ’s a little girl . ”
He did n’t deny it , Nasser recalls .
Instead he complained that Nujood ’s father had said she was much taller and better looking than she really was .
Nasser vowed to Nujood that she would take her case without pay and that she would take care of her .
She took her to her upscale home and offered to let her stay there .
Advertisement
Outraged , Nasser also called her contacts at the Yemen Times , the country ’s English - language newspaper .
The story of the brave little girl who went to court on her own to stand up for her rights captivated the country .
News agencies picked up the story and sent it around the world .
When a sympathetic judge agreed to hear her case several weeks later , reporters packed the courtroom .
Verbally , Judge Mohammed Ghadi was merciless to the husband .
“ You could not find another woman to marry in all of Yemen ? ” he demanded .
Advertisement
But legally , there was little he could do .
No provision in Yemeni law provides for prosecution on sexual abuse charges within a marriage .
Not only did the husband and father go free , but Thamer demanded $ 250 , the equivalent of four months ’ salary for a poor Yemeni , to agree to a divorce .
A sympathetic lawyer donated the cash .
Nujood was elated .
“ She was smiling , ” Nasser recalls .
“ She said , ‘ I want chocolate .
I want pears , cake and toys . ’ ”
Nasser bought her some new clothes .
Donations began pouring in , with several wealthy Europeans offering to pay for her education .
One newspaper held a big party for her .
A Yemeni journalist gave her a cellphone .
Advertisement
When the controversy died down , Nujood insisted on going back to live with her parents , most likely because she is very close to her sister Haifa , 8 .
Her father promised that he would not marry off Nujood or any of her sisters .
The girl has refused to see a psychologist or a gynecologist .
She says she does n’t like doctors .
And besides , she says , the experience has made her stronger and wiser .
She says she ’s had enough of marriage and domestic life , and looks forward to beginning third grade and pursuing dreams she never knew she had .
“ I want to defend oppressed people , ” she says .
“ I want to be like Shada .
I want to be an example for all the other girls . ”

Far and away our biggest vote - getter , we 're not even going to try to describe what the Bible is and what it means .
Thank goodness Wikipedia describes the Bible for us thusly :
The Bible is the collection of religious writings of Judaism and of Christianity .
The exact composition of the Bible is dependent on the religious traditions of specific denominations .
Modern Rabbinic Judaism generally recognizes a single set of canonical books that comprise the Tanakh , the Jewish version of the Bible .
The Christian Bible includes the same books as the Tanakh ( referred to in this context as the Old Testament ) , but usually in a different order , together with specifically Christian books collectively called the New Testament .
Among some Christian traditions , the Bible includes additional Jewish books that were not accepted into the Tanakh .

Several authors had multiple works mentioned by our readers , but none had such a strong showing as Ayn Rand .
Most influential was The Fountainhead , followed by Atlas Shrugged and Anthem .
From Wikipedia's
The Fountainhead page :
Advertisement
The Fountainhead is set in the world of Architecture and examines Howard Roark , a young architect who chooses to struggle in obscurity rather than compromise his artistic and personal vision .
He refuses to pander to the prevailing ' architect by committee ' taste in building design .
Roark is a singular force that takes a stand against the establishment , and in his own unique way , prevails .
The manuscript was rejected by twelve publishers before a young editor , Archibald Ogden , at the Bobbs - Merrill Company publishing house wired to the head office , " If this is not the book for you , then I am not the editor for you . "

From Wikipedia's Atlas Shrugged page :
The theme of Atlas Shrugged is the role of the mind in man 's existence and , consequently , presentation of the morality of rational self - interest .
The main conflicts of the book surround the decision of the " individuals of the mind " to go on strike , refusing to contribute their inventions , art , business leadership , scientific research , or new ideas of any kind to the rest of the world .
Society , they believe , hampers them by interfering with their work and underpays them by confiscating the profits and dignity they have rightfully earned .
The peaceful cohesiveness of the world disintegrates , lacking those individuals whose productive work comes from mental effort .
The strikers believe that they are crucial to a society that exploits them , denying them freedom or failing to acknowledge their right to self - interest , and the gradual collapse of civilization is triggered by their strike .

From Wikipedia 's
Anthem page :
Anthem is a dystopian , science - fiction novella by philosopher Ayn Rand , first published in 1938 .
It takes place at some unspecified future date when mankind has entered another dark age as a result of the evils of irrationality and collectivism and the weaknesses of socialistic thinking and economics .
Technological advancement is now carefully planned ( when it is allowed to occur at all ) and the concept of individuality has been eliminated ( for example , the word " I " has disappeared from the language ) .
As is common in her work , Rand draws a clear distinction between the " socialist / communal " values of equality and brotherhood and the " productive / capitalist " values of achievement and individuality .

by Albert Camus
From Amazon.com :
The Stranger is not merely one of the most widely read novels of the 20th century , but one of the books likely to outlive it .
Written in 1946 , Camus 's compelling and troubling tale of a disaffected , apparently amoral young man has earned a durable popularity ( and remains a staple of U.S. high school literature courses ) in part because it reveals so vividly the anxieties of its time .
Alienation , the fear of anonymity , spiritual doubt — all could have been given a purely modern inflection in the hands of a lesser talent than Camus , who won the Nobel Prize in 1957 and was noted for his existentialist aesthetic .
The remarkable trick of The Stranger , however , is that it 's not mired in period philosophy .

Another early 20th century author who received reader acclaim for more than a single book , George Orwell appears on the list both for 1984 and Animal Farm .
From Amazon.com :
[ 1984 was ] published in 1949 as a warning about the menaces of totalitarianism .
The novel is set in an imaginary future world that is dominated by three perpetually warring totalitarian police states .
The book 's hero , Winston Smith , is a minor party functionary in one of these states .
His longing for truth and decency leads him to secretly rebel against the government .
Smith has a love affair with a like - minded woman , but they are both arrested by the Thought Police .
The ensuing imprisonment , torture , and reeducation of Smith are intended not merely to break him physically or make him submit but to root out his independent mental existence and his spiritual dignity .
Orwell 's warning of the dangers of totalitarianism made a deep impression on his contemporaries and upon subsequent readers , and the book 's title and many of its coinages , such as NEWSPEAK , became bywords for modern political abuses .

Anti-utopian satire by George Orwell , published in 1945 .
One of Orwell 's finest works , it is a political fable based on the events of Russia 's Bolshevik revolution and the betrayal of the cause by Joseph Stalin .
The book concerns a group of barnyard animals who overthrow and chase off their exploitative human masters and set up an egalitarian society of their own .
Eventually the animals ' intelligent and power - loving leaders , the pigs , subvert the revolution and form a dictatorship even more oppressive and heartless than that of their former human masters .

Dawkins is the most contemporary non-fiction author on the list to be voted in with multiple books .
Readers were most influenced by The Selfish Gene , followed closely by The God Delusion .
From Amazon.com :
Richard Dawkins ' brilliant reformulation of the theory of natural selection has the rare distinction of having provoked as much excitement and interest outside the scientific community as within it .
His theories have helped change the whole nature of the study of social biology , and have forced thousands of readers to rethink their beliefs about life .
In his internationally bestselling , now classic volume , The Selfish Gene , Dawkins explains how the selfish gene can also be a subtle gene .
The world of the selfish gene revolves around savage competition , ruthless exploitation , and deceit , and yet , Dawkins argues , acts of apparent altruism do exist in nature .
Bees , for example , will commit suicide when they sting to protect the hive , and birds will risk their lives to warn the flock of an approaching hawk .
... [ The Selfish Gene ] is a celebration of a remarkable exposition of evolutionary thought , a work that has been widely hailed for its stylistic brilliance and deep scientific insights , and that continues to stimulate whole new areas of research today .
Advertisement
In his sensational international bestseller , the preeminent scientist and outspoken atheist Richard Dawkins delivers a hard - hitting , impassioned , but humorous rebuttal of religious belief .
With rigor and wit , Dawkins eviscerates the arguments for religion and demonstrates the supreme improbability of the existence of a supreme being .
He makes a compelling case that faith is not just irrational , but potentially deadly ...
This brilliantly argued , provocative book challenges all of us to test our beliefs , no matter what beliefs we hold .

by Frank Herbert
From Amazon.com :
This Hugo and Nebula Award winner tells the sweeping tale of a desert planet called Arrakis , the focus of an intricate power struggle in a byzantine interstellar empire .
Arrakis is the sole source of Melange , the " spice of spices . "
Melange is necessary for interstellar travel and grants psychic powers and longevity , so whoever controls it wields great influence .
The troubles begin when stewardship of Arrakis is transferred by the Emperor from the Harkonnen Noble House to House Atreides .
The Harkonnens do n't want to give up their privilege , though , and through sabotage and treachery they cast young Duke Paul Atreides out into the planet 's harsh environment to die .
There he falls in with the Fremen , a tribe of desert dwellers who become the basis of the army with which he will reclaim what 's rightfully his .
Paul Atreides , though , is far more than just a usurped duke .
He might be the end product of a very long - term genetic experiment designed to breed a super human ; he might be a messiah .
His struggle is at the center of a nexus of powerful people and events , and the repercussions will be felt throughout the Imperium .
Dune is one of the most famous science fiction novels ever written , and deservedly so .
The setting is elaborate and ornate , the plot labyrinthine , the adventures exciting .
Five sequels follow .

Thanks to all the commenters for sharing their life - changing reads with us .
Three months ago — jeebers , has it really been that long ?
— I posed the following homework assignment :
Do a stack trace of the human cognitive algorithms that produce debates about “ free will . ”
Note that this task is strongly distinguished from arguing that free will does or does not exist .
Now , as expected , people are asking , “ If the future is determined , how can our choices control it ? ”
The wise reader can guess that it all adds up to normality ; but this leaves the question of how .
People hear : “ The universe runs like clockwork ; physics is deterministic ; the future is fixed . ”
And their minds form a causal network that looks like this :
Here we see the causes “ Me ” and “ Physics , ” competing to determine the state of the “ Future ” effect .
If the “ Future ” is fully determined by “ Physics , ” then obviously there is no room for it to be affected by “ Me . ”
This causal network is not an explicit philosophical belief .
It ’s implicit — a background representation of the brain , controlling which philosophical arguments seem “ reasonable . ”
It just seems like the way things are .
Every now and then , another neuroscience press release appears , claiming that , because researchers used an fMRI to spot the brain doing something - or - other during a decision process , it ’s not you who chooses , it ’s your brain .
Likewise that old chestnut , “ Reductionism undermines rationality itself .
Because then , every time you said something , it would n’t be the result of reasoning about the evidence — it would be merely quarks bopping around . ”
Of course the actual diagram should be :
Or better yet :
Why is this not obvious ?
Because there are many levels of organization that separate our models of our thoughts — our emotions , our beliefs , our agonizing indecisions , and our final choices — from our models of electrons and quarks .
We can intuitively visualize that a hand is made of fingers ( and thumb and palm ) .
To ask whether it ’s really our hand that picks something up , or merely our fingers , thumb , and palm , is transparently a wrong question .
But the gap between physics and cognition cannot be crossed by direct visualization .
No one can visualize atoms making up a person , the way they can see fingers making up a hand .
And so it requires constant vigilance to maintain your perception of yourself as an entity within physics .
This vigilance is one of the great keys to philosophy , like the Mind Projection Fallacy .
You will recall that it is this point which I nominated as having tripped up the quantum physicists who failed to imagine macroscopic decoherence ; they did not think to apply the laws to themselves .
Beliefs , desires , emotions , morals , goals , imaginations , anticipations , sensory perceptions , fleeting wishes , ideals , temptations …
You might call this the “ surface layer ” of the mind , the parts - of - self that people can see even without science .
If I say , “ It is not you who determines the future , it is your desires , plans , and actions that determine the future , ” you can readily see the part - whole relations .
It is immediately visible , like fingers making up a hand .
There are other part - whole relations all the way down to physics , but they are not immediately visible .
“ Compatibilism ” is the philosophical position that “ free will ” can be intuitively and satisfyingly defined in such a way as to be compatible with deterministic physics .
“ Incompatibilism ” is the position that free will and determinism are incompatible .
My position might perhaps be called “ Requiredism . ”
When agency , choice , control , and moral responsibility are cashed out in a sensible way , they require determinism — at least some patches of determinism within the universe .
If you choose , and plan , and act , and bring some future into being , in accordance with your desire , then all this requires a lawful sort of reality ; you can not do it amid utter chaos .
There must be order over at least those parts of reality that are being controlled by you .
You are within physics , and so you / physics have determined the future .
If it were not determined by physics , it could not be determined by you .
Or perhaps I should say , “ If the future were not determined by reality , it could not be determined by you , ” or “ If the future were not determined by something , it could not be determined by you . ”
You do n’t need neuroscience or physics to push naive definitions of free will into incoherence .
If the mind were not embodied in the brain , it would be embodied in something else ; there would be some real thing that was a mind .
If the future were not determined by physics , it would be determined by something , some law , some order , some grand reality that included you within it .
But if the laws of physics control us , then how can we be said to control ourselves ?
Turn it around :
If the laws of physics did not control us , how could we possibly control ourselves ?
How could thoughts judge other thoughts , how could emotions conflict with each other , how could one course of action appear best , how could we pass from uncertainty to certainty about our own plans , in the midst of utter chaos ?
If we were not in reality , where could we be ?
The future is determined by physics .
What kind of physics ?
The kind of physics that includes the actions of human beings .
People ’s choices are determined by physics .
What kind of physics ?
The kind of physics that includes weighing decisions , considering possible outcomes , judging them , being tempted , following morals , rationalizing transgressions , trying to do better …
There is no point where a quark swoops in from Pluto and overrides all this .
The thoughts of your decision process are all real , they are all something .
But a thought is too big and complicated to be an atom .
So thoughts are made of smaller things , and our name for the stuff that stuff is made of is “ physics . ”
Physics underlies our decisions and includes our decisions .
It does not explain them away .
Remember , physics adds up to normality ; it ’s your cognitive algorithms that generate confusion
SEOUL , South Korea  South Korea ’s entire cabinet offered to resign on Tuesday as President Lee Myung - bak struggled to find a breakthrough in the biggest political crisis to face his young government , one set off by fears that an agreement to reopen markets to American beef could expose the public to mad cow disease .
Prime Minister Han Seung - soo and other cabinet members submitted their resignations to Mr. Lee hours before tens of thousands of South Koreans were scheduled to rally in downtown Seoul in what organizers said would be the largest demonstration to be held against the president and his 107 - day - old government .
For the past 40 days , downtown Seoul has been rocked daily by demonstrations .
What had started as a rally by hundreds of teenage students holding candles to protest the importing of American beef has evolved into a broad demonstration against government policies , with students , homemakers and workers chanting “ Out with Lee Myung - bak ! ”
On Tuesday Cho Hang-nam , a spokesman for Mr. Han , said , “ The prime minister offered the resignations on behalf of cabinet members when he met President Lee this morning . ”
Lawsuit Loans can help make ends meet for plaintiffs who are unable to work or behind on their bills after a car accident or some other type of injury .
American Pride Legal Funding provides advances for plaintiffs who were injured through no fault of their own .
Lawsuit loans might be referred to as settlement loans and pre settlement funding , however receiving an advance on your case is not actually a loan .
Receiving an advance is non recourse funding because you only repay the advance if you win your case .

La Audiencia de Bizkaia condenó al acusado a 11 años de cárcel , pero ahora el Supremo estima que no hay pruebas suficientes para dos de los cinco abusos .
Por eso baja la condena de 11 a 2 años .
It has been somewhat discouraging to watch how Sony has handled the availability of classic PSOne games on the PlayStation Network .
It 's great that you can download these reasonably priced games on your PS3 and also play them on your PSP , but it does n't really matter when they 're games like Jet Moto .
Sorry , Jet Moto fans .
The only ones I 've felt were worth downloading so far were Castlevania : Symphony of the Night and Wild Arms .
Square Enix has us covered now .
Hopefully .
They 've passed word on to GamesIndustry .
biz that 12 PSOne classics are coming to the PlayStation Network .
There 's no word on specific titles , but you can probably guess a few .
I know there have to be some nerdy delights among the planned releases
The Japanese PSN already has six Squeenix titles available , including Einhänder , Raystorm , and a personal favorite , Xenogears .
Hopefully we 'll see these titles make it here .
Have you used the PSOne download feature on the PS3 or PSP ?
What other Square Enix titles would you like to see released ?
[ Thanks , coonskin05 ]
Matita ( that means pencil in italian ) is an experimental , interactive theorem prover under development at the Computer Science Department of the University of Bologna .
An interactive prover is a software tool aiding the development of formal proofs by man-machine collaboration .
It provides a formal language where mathematical definitions , executable algorithms and theorems cohexist , and an interactive environment keeping the current status of the proof , and updating it according to commands ( usually called tactics ) issued by the user .
Matita is based on a Dependent Type System known as the Calculus of Inductive Constructions .
It embeds key computational constructs of functional programming languages : functions can be defined by ( well - founded ) recursion , and are live entities that can be tested and executed .
At the same time , proofs are an integrated part of the formalism , allowing , via the Curry Howard isomorphism , a smooth interplay between specification , implementation and verification : proofs are objects of the language , and can be treated as normal data , naturally leading to a programming style akin to proof - carrying - code , where chunks of software come equipped with proofs of ( some of ) their properties .
Matita is currently adopted in the European Union " Certified Complexity " Project CerCo for the formal verification of a complexity - preserving compiler from a large subset of C to a microcontroller assembly of the kind traditionally used in embedded systems .
Images of sexy women tend to whet men ’s sexual appetite .
But stimulating new research in the Journal of Consumer Research says there ’s more than meets the eye .
A recent study shows that men who watched sexy videos or handled lingerie sought immediate gratification — even when they were making decisions about money , soda , and candy .
Authors Bram Van den Bergh , Siegfried DeWitte , and Luk Warlop ( KULeuven , Belgium ) found that the desire for immediate rewards increased in men who touched bras , looked at pictures of beautiful women , or watched video clips of young women in bikinis running through a park .
“ It seems that sexual appetite causes a greater urgency to consume anything rewarding , ” the authors suggest .
Thus , the activation of sexual desire appears to spill over into other brain systems involved in reward - seeking behaviors , even the cognitive desire for money .
“ After they touched a bra , men are more likely to be content with a smaller immediate monetary reward , ” writes Bram Van den Bergh , one of the study ’s authors .
“ Prior exposure to sexy stimuli may influence the choice between chocolate cake or fruit for dessert . ”
The authors believe the stimuli bring men ’s minds to the present as opposed to the future .
“ The study demonstrates that bikinis cause a shift in time preference : Men live in the here and now when they glance at pictures featuring women in lingerie .
That is , men will choose the immediately available rewards and seek immediate gratification after sex cue exposure . ”
Do all straight men respond the same ?
Actually , no .
Some men are highly responsive to rewards while others are not so sensitive , and the more reward - sensitive men are the impatient ones .
In fact , doing a task designed to inspire financial satisfaction reduced the bikini - inspired impatience , just as feeling full reduces food cravings .
Men may want to be aware of bikinis ’ effects on their bank accounts and waistlines .
KARACHI , Pakistan  Praying in Pakistan has not been easy for Mesut Kacmaz , a Muslim teacher from Turkey .
He tried the mosque near his house , but it had Israeli and Danish flags painted on the floor for people to step on .
The mosque near where he works warned him never to return wearing a tie .
Pakistanis everywhere assume he is not Muslim because he has no beard .
“ Kill , fight , shoot , ” Mr. Kacmaz said .
“ This is a misinterpretation of Islam . ”
But that view is common in Pakistan , a frontier land for the future of Islam , where schools , nourished by Saudi and American money dating back to the 1980s , have spread Islamic radicalism through the poorest parts of society .
With a literacy rate of just 50 percent and a public school system near collapse , the country is particularly vulnerable .
Mr. Kacmaz ( pronounced KATCH - maz ) is part of a group of Turkish educators who have come to this battleground with an entirely different vision of Islam .
Theirs is moderate and flexible , comfortably coexisting with the West while remaining distinct from it .
Like Muslim Peace Corps volunteers , they promote this approach in schools , which are now established in more than 80 countries , Muslim and Christian .
So , maybe I ’m a little late to this party , but I wanted to comment on a recent XCKD ( yes , Isabel blogged it first , though I added it to our del.icio.us before she blogged it ) .
This arranged several scientific fields , by order of purity .
Of course , the mathematician is standing at the far end of the scale ( saying “ Oh hey , I did n’t see you guys all the way over there ” ) .
The same point has circulated in saying form as
“ Biologists defer to chemists .
Chemists defer to physicists .
Physicists defer to mathematicians .
Mathematicians defer only to God ”
( does anyone have an attribution for this quote ?
My Google - fu was insufficient ) .
Now , I think it ’s clear that I love XKCD ( one of these days , I ’ll get my shit together and drive out to the Boston meet - up .
Who knows , maybe next Saturday ) , but I ca n’t help but disagree a bit with the premise of this comic .
I think it misses something pretty important about mathematics .
I spend a reasonable amount of time thinking about what mathematics is , and how to explain this other people .
You see , unlike ( I believe ) all my other co-bloggers , I ’m single , which leads to me periodically dating , and thus having to explain to women who are not mathematicians , but rather , say , journalists or librarians or public - health types what mathematics is and why it is an endeavor a reasonable person would undertake .
( One might suggest that even romantically - attached mathematicians have non-mathematical friends that they need to explain this stuff to .
I would reply that there ’s a bit less , ahem , biological imperative involved there ) .
And I think one of the key points here is this : mathematics is not science .
Mathematics is often lumped in with science , and is often used by scientists .
Mathematicians often know more science than normal people , and certainly scientists know more mathematics .
But mathematics and science are fundamentally different activities , as different as making a gun and fighting in a battle .
I mean , no one would claim there are no links between those occupations , or that gun-makers do n’t pay a lot of attention to how guns are used , but not even a child would mistake one for the other .
Putting mathematics on a continuum of purity with sciences is like putting it on a continuum with disciplines of art ordered by “ highbrow - ness ” ( actually , I would argue that the latter captures the nature of mathematics better ) .
Consider the inane saying I quote above ; anyone mathematician who ’s met a physicist does n’t really believe that .
Physicists do n’t defer to mathematicians , they defer to data .
As do chemists , biologists , psychologists and sociologists , irrespective of their social relations with each other .
Mathematicians , on the other hand , have escaped the tyranny of data .
We are often guided in what we do by examples from other fields , but mathematics by definition is universal , rather than science , which is constrained by actual observations of the world .
Now , of course , scientists would argue that the actual important questions about this universe , the one we live in , the world around us , we need data , and of course , they are right .
You will never here me putting down science .
But that ’s not what I do , and personally I find that liberating .
Not everybody agrees , and that ’s fine , they can spend years hunched over a lab bench , or anxiously awaiting the results of terrifying expensive experiments at CERN .
I ’ll be happy staring at my chalkboard , scratching my head .

Hiding $ 81,000 in cash under the floorboard of a car and driving toward Mexico is not enough to prove the driver was guilty of money laundering , the Supreme Court ruled Monday .
Instead , the court said , prosecutors must also prove the driver was traveling to Mexico for the purpose of hiding the true source of the funds .
This was one of a pair of decisions handed down Monday that could make it harder for prosecutors to win convictions for money laundering .
This law has been one of the government ’s most powerful weapons in the war on drugs .
In the second ruling , the court said the law against laundering money applies only to profits of an illegal operation , not all of the cash it generates .
Although there are other laws that can be used to prosecute the smuggling of cash , Congress hoped to interrupt the drug trade when it made it a separate crime in 1986 to transport cash into or out of the country so as to carry on “ unlawful activity ” or to “ conceal or disguise ” the source of the money .
This sometimes allowed prosecutors to win convictions and long prison terms by catching defendants who could not explain why they had large quantities of cash .

Defense lawyers complained the law was used to press defendants to plead guilty to other crimes , such as drug dealing .
A Washington lawyer who represents white - collar defendants said the justices were concerned about the law being used too broadly .
“ The decisions today significantly raise the bar for prosecutors to prove money laundering charges , ” said Jeffrey Green , who filed a friend - of - the - court brief for the National Assn. of Criminal Defense Lawyers .
Most people who carry large amounts of cash are inclined to hide it for security , he said , so this alone should not be enough to prove the crime .
On July 14 , 2004 , Humberto Cuellar of Acuna , Mexico , was driving very slowly in southern Texas toward the Mexican border .
He ran off the road , and a patrol officer saw that his Volkswagen Beetle did not have a license plate .

Officers found $ 81,000 in cash in a secret compartment under the floorboard .
Cuellar changed his story several times and could not explain where he was going or where he got the money .
He was convicted of money laundering and sentenced to 6 1/2 years in prison .
The Supreme Court reversed his conviction in a 9 - 0 vote .
“ We agree with [ Cuellar ] that merely hiding funds during transportation is not sufficient to violate the [ money laundering ] statute , even if substantial efforts have been expended to conceal the money , ” Justice Clarence Thomas said .
In the second ruling , the court voted 5 to 4 to reverse an Indiana man ’s conviction for money laundering that was based on cash from an illegal lottery .
Efrain Santos got five years in prison for his gambling operation and nearly 18 years more for money laundering .
But Justice Antonin Scalia said the law referred to the “ proceeds of some form of unlawful activity . ”
Congress did not define that word ; Scalia said the court should give the benefit of the doubt to the defendant .

Chief Justice John G. Roberts and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy , Steven G. Breyer and Samuel A. Alito Jr. dissented .

They 're violent , they 're ruthless , they have caused misery to many , but you can't fault their business sense : mafia bosses know how to make a profit .
Its practices may be largely illegal , but Cosa Nostra is not as retrograde , or conservative , as it has often been portrayed .
Its raison d'etre is profit .
Like any business , it is pragmatic and constantly changing to exploit new opportunities .
Big business has learned how to sell itself to the public , with television shows such as The Apprentice and Dragons '
Den granting us a view of harsh but compellingly competitive environments .
Businessmen such as Sir Alan Sugar , Duncan Bannatyne and Peter Jones have become unlikely media personalities .
But the mafia has been using these methods for years .
When Bernardo Provenzano took over the organisation in the mid-90s , he inherited a depleted and demoralised workforce , who had scuppered their own access to politics and industry .
The bombs that killed anti-mafia judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino had created a PR disaster and a law enforcement backlash .
Hundreds of mafiosi were in prison , and many of them were so disillusioned with the organisation that they were telling the authorities everything they knew .
Magistrates and mafiosi agree : Provenzano was the charismatic force who revived the fortunes of Cosa Nostra .
It has been said of Provenzano , as of so many mafia entrepreneurs , that had he turned his talents and resources to legitimate business , he would have been extremely successful .
Fortunately , the mafia 's particular modus operandi - the use or threat of violence to create monopolies and price - fixing cartels - is not part of general business practice .
But his " System " turned around a failing organisation with far - sighted tactics worthy of any business impresario .
The fact that he wrote his reforms by letter means that we have what amounts to seven rules for running a successful business .
Rule 1 : Submersion
When a company is failing , the first step is to take it below the radar .
You want to lose that cursed epithet " troubled " as quickly as possible , even if it means disappearing from the business pages .
"
It 's the sensible thing to do - you bury your mistakes and get on with it , " says Peter Wallis ( known as Peter York in his other guise , as a social commentator ) , management consultant at SRU Ltd .
You also want to buy shareholders ' patience and convince them to hold their nerve and trust you .
" Our aim was to make Cosa Nostra invisible , giving us time to regroup , " recalled Provenzano 's lieutenant , Nino Giuffrè , who collaborated shortly after his arrest in 2002 .
After a series of power struggles that had left many dead , businessmen were understandably reluctant to return calls .
Mafiosi were instructed to avoid any activity that would attract publicity .
If a factory owner refused to pay protection , no one was to set fire to the machinery or blow up the trucks .
Peaceful persuasion was the only way .
By contrast with the old - style system of shoot first and ask questions later , any hostile action would have to be thoroughly assessed for potential PR damage .
" It was essential to weigh up whether a person could do more damage dead or alive , " revealed Giuffrè .
Announcing his system , Provenzano warned that recovery would take time : members might have to wait between five and seven years before they were making profits again .
Rebuilding links with business and politicians could only be done out of the glare of publicity .
In relative obscurity , Cosa Nostra would be repositioned to shake off its parasitic image and become part of the industrial and political institutions .
Rule 2 : Mediation
" Be calm , clear , correct and consistent , turn any negative experiences to account , do n't dismiss everything people tell you , or believe everything you 're told .
Always try to discover the truth before you speak , and remember that , to make your judgment , it 's never enough to have just one source of information . "
This letter has been described as " a manifesto of Cosa Nostra under Bernardo Provenzano " .
After a decade of unspeakable violence under the previous leader , Totò Riina , Provenzano changed the culture of Cosa Nostra by instructing his men in the art of negotiation and the importance of dialogue .
Provenzano was decisive , and on occasion demanded swift and direct answers to his questions , but he could be a ditherer when it suited him .
Playing for time , he encouraged his men to negotiate agreements between them .
If that failed , Provenzano was at his typewriter night and day , offering his wisdom and experience ( and just occasionally , a little double - dealing ) to resolve disputes .
Like any company director , who carefully crafts his or her media persona , Provenzano did n't want to come across as a tyrant , he wanted to be a " kindly dictator " .
He coordinated the activities of different and competing groups , without imposing his will .
He was the uncontested boss , but he gave the impression that his decisions were reached after long consultation .
Rule 3 : Consensus
Provenzano answered letters from every level of society about job vacancies , exam results , local health and hospital administration .
Like the charity work carried out by major corporations today , Provenzano was clear : the mafia must present itself as a positive element of society .
The boss had to appear as a beneficent figure , an uncle whose advice and consent was sought on all matters - business and personal .
He understood that persuading the people they need you is a far more effective way of promoting your business than imposition and violence .
" Let me know whatever [ the people ] need , " he wrote to his adviser , " they must expect nothing but good from us . "
One key step in the organisation 's recovery was recapturing the popular consensus .
The mafia has always relied on the obedience ( goodwill might be putting it too strongly ) of the community .
In the business of selling protection , social control is essential : if your " clients " unite and rebel , you 're in trouble .
Rule 4 : Keep God on your side
Part of Provenzano's bid to reclaim the people 's trust and rehabilitate Cosa Nostra with its traditional followers was to assume a mantle of piety .
He presented himself in pastoral role - trustworthy and authoritative .
His letters read like the parish priest 's homily , and he would send his men tracts copied from the Bible .
Investigators tried hard to discover a hidden code beneath all the underlined passages in his Bible .
In fact , it seems , he found them genuinely useful as leadership tools .
Provenzano's choice of tracts revealed , according to investigators , " a certain attention to rules , to punishments , guilt and vengeance , as though he were searching for some inspiration and authority to support him in his responsibilities and the decisions that were a necessary part of being the head of an organisation " .
In an approach adopted by politicians including Tony Blair , Provenzano 's letters contain the strong implication that God is exercising his will through him ( " May the Lord bless you and keep you ... know that where I can be of use to you , with the will of God , I am completely at your disposal ... " ) .
The status as homespun churchgoer also worked for George Bush in his pursuit of popular consensus .
" Bush 's religion is very variable , " comments Wallis .
" He courts rightwing evangelicals but he does n't buy the whole package ; he merely wants to relate to them . "
Rule 5 : Be politically flexible
Businessmen from all walks of life and political persuasion usually find themselves co-opted on to a government advisory board eventually .
The East End boy made good is not your traditional Labour supporter , but Sir Alan Sugar has reportedly been advising Gordon Brown on enterprise .
" This government 's not Labour , it 's old - fashioned Tory , " he says .
" I prefer Gordon to Tony .
Blair was refreshing but Brown is more like me .
He has a strong work ethic . "
Provenzano took this further , changing his political allegiance whenever it suited him .
He looked for politicians who were prepared to pursue his self - serving demands for lighter sentences against convicted mafiosi , as well as the end of protection for collaborators .
" Links were to be forged behind the scenes with politicians who had no trace of connection to scandal or sleaze , " recalled Giuffrè .
" If a politician was seen to be supported by men of honour of a certain rank , within 24 hours he'd be destroyed by the opposition . "
Rule 6 : Reinvention
In case of a political scandal , or a business failure , it is vital for the new boss to be able to distance himself from the whole affair .
Indeed , he may find it useful to take on a new persona altogether .
When Stuart Rose returned to Arcadia after three years to rescue it , he said : " What is interesting is that people here think I have n't changed , but I have been gone three years .
I am not the same Stuart Rose , I have changed a lot . "
With Provenzano's new directives , not only did the negative headlines cease , but he managed to dissociate himself from the scandals that had gone before .
Like everyone else , he had emerged from Cosa Nostra 's most violent decade with his reputation in tatters ; his advisers helped him to " get his virginity back " , in Giuffrè 's interesting phrase .
With the help of his PR - savvy advisers , he made sure no one associated him with the violent years , and created his image as the peacemaker .
" When I got out of prison , " Giuffrè recalled , " I found Provenzano a changed man ; from the hitman he once was , now he showed signs of saintliness . "
Rule 7 : Modesty
During his career , Provenzano transformed himself from a hired thug , to business investor , political mastermind and , ultimately , strategist and leader .
Part of his mystique was that no one really knew whether he was a genius or an illiterate chancer .
To emphasise his humble character and present himself as a simple man of the people he would write letters full of spelling and grammatical mistakes , and always signed off with the same humble apology : " I beg your forgiveness for the errors in my writing ... "
Every letter ends with the same saintly and affectionate benediction and an apology for grammatical errors .
The bad spelling and schoolboy mistakes detracted nothing from the authority of its writer .
For a man who moved easily in the worlds of business and politics , it was apparently part of a carefully constructed image .
Investigators maintain his semi-literacy was a deliberate ruse .
It 's a strategy that political and business leaders have used to good effect .
" George Bush 's family is as upper - class as you 're going to get in the United States , " says Wallis .
" He is not a real Texan .
To what extent he talks like that out of incompetence , to what extent it is crowd - pleasing , we do n't know - but we know it works . "
Similarly , Justin King , multimillionaire saviour of Sainsbury 's , says : " I 'm not a book reader ... I 'm just a normal bloke . "
Sugar has never disavowed his East End roots , his upbringing in a Hackney council house .
He does n't give himself airs , but the point is still made : he grew up with no privileges , but he is the one with the power .
Provenzano took false modesty a step further , suggesting ( almost entirely untruthfully ) that he would rather have someone else in charge .
" They want me to tell them what to do , " he wrote , " but who am I to tell them how to conduct themselves ?
I can't give orders to anyone , indeed I look for someone who can give orders to me . "
Unfortunately for him , since his arrest in 2006 , his wishes have been fulfilled .

LOGAN , Utah - NASA is marchingforward on its Moon , Mars and beyond planning , a multi-step action agendaenunciated by President George W. Bush as the vision for space exploration inJanuary 2004 .
One goal of that plan is returning humans to the Moon as early as2015 and no later than 2020 .
NASA 'stop official , Mike Griffin , has his multi-tasking hands full in shaping andimplementing the vision strategy -- from the ground up : new launch vehicles forcrew and cargo , a six - person Crew Exploration Vehicle , as well as looking atthe future of international cooperation in putting verve to the vision .
Griffin spoke to SPACE .comduring the 20th Annual Conference on Small Satellites held hereearlier this month at Utah State University .
CEV : stressing requirements
NASAis set to announce on August 31 the prime contractor to design , develop , and build the Crew Exploration Vehicle ( CEV ) -- now dubbed Orion - - a replacement of the government ' sspace shuttle .
As a system , the CEV will accomplish in many areas what theshuttle offers , Griffin said , but also must fly back and forth between the Earth and the Moon .
" Inlater decades , the CEV will be one piece of the Mars architecture .
It 's howpeople will come home from Mars through the atmosphere .
So the CEV has somepretty stressing requirements on it , " Griffin explained .
Butthe ultimate goal of the CEV program is not the creation of new technologies , Griffin warned .
" TheCEV is primarily a tool for getting humans up through the atmosphere and backdown through the atmosphere .
And my goal is to do it as simply and safely aspossible . "
Whatneeds to be shaken off is the idea that the U.S. civilian space program is allabout flying from Earth 's surface to low Earth orbit , Griffin added .
" Theexcitement is what we 're going to do at the Moon ; when we 're going to go toMars and what we 're going to do there , " he said .
" It 's not about the first andlast hundred miles . "
Giventhe vision 's long - term strategy , harmonized with tight budgets , is the questmore a mission impossible ?
" Certainlynot , " Griffin responded .
" I just keep putting one foot in front of the otherand moving forward .
And I think that 's the strategy that is going to help usnow . "
Griffin said the spaceagency has enough money to do the core things that it wants to do forexploration and science .
" Science is well funded , " he said , however " we don ' thave enough money to do ... things as rapidly as all of us would like . "
Enlisting international partners
Griffin outlined histhoughts on the role of international cooperation within the vision .
" Wehope to enlist international partners , to bring some of the elements that we won' tbe able to afford to build , " Griffin said .
" We do n't have big habitats , laboratories , power stations , things like that for a lunar base .
We do n't havethem in our budget .
We have got transportation ' to and from ' in our budget . "
Thearrangement that NASA 's hoping for is much like that of the International SpaceStation ( ISS ) , Griffin said .
But that 's also a pact that has been roundlycriticized by non-U.S. ISS partners in the past .
Image 1 of 2 Image 2 of 2
" Thecriticism that -- to put slightly more detail on it -- is that America dictated everyone 's role , " he said .
" I 'm not for exploration dictating anyone ' srole except America's .
I 'm saying this is what the United States will do . "
Thereare a myriad of other things that international partners or commercial entitiescould bring to the vision table , Griffin suggested , such as launching roboticcargo landers on Europe 's Ariane 5 to deliver scientific instruments and telescopesto the Moon .
" Wewill be very receptive to that .
But I 'm not prescribing any of them .
And I 'vebeen very clear about that , " Griffin added .
" The role of internationalcooperation is not to help figure out what the United States will spend itsmoney on . "
Three days from home
Griffin was blunt aboutNASA 's need to rekindle its engineering might to return humans to the Moon - - arepeat feat done in 1969 through 1972 .
" Peopleseem to have an attitude that because people two generations ago went to the Moonthat we have all that experience , that we have the equipment just waiting inreserve .
We do n't .
We do n't have the equipment .
We do n't have the tooling .
Insome cases , we do n't even have the basic technology any more .
And we certainly don't have the experience base in the people for spaceflight beyond low Earthorbit , " Griffin observed .
BeforeNASA can send an expedition to Mars , the space agency needs to recreate thatfull infrastructure , Griffin said .
" And the place to apply it is at the Moonwhen you 're three days from home . "
Inlooking outward beyond the Moon , Griffin said he envisions Mars as a humandestination for the United States in the mid-2020 's or beyond .
" Ido n't think anybody thinks that 2025 or beyond is unrealistic .
You could go toMars sooner if we did n't have a policy that says we 're doing other things .
Butour nation 's space policy says that we will finish the space station ( and ) thatwe will return to the Moon .
So if you 're going to do those things then Mars isgoing to have to wait a bit .
It 's a fiscal matter more than it is a technicalmatter , " Griffin concluded .
In California , marijuana is supposed to be prescribed only to people suffering from life - threatening conditions but David Willis finds the reality is quite different .
About 250,000 Californians carry prescriptions for marijuana A Google search revealed plenty of options .
I had typed in medicinal marijuana +
Los Angeles and within seconds there was practically smoke coming out of the back of my computer .
Among the seemingly endless stream of entries was a place advertised as a " medicinal clinic " where " qualified patients " could obtain a doctor 's recommendation allowing them the legal use of marijuana .
They offered a $ 25 discount for new patients .
I called and made an appointment for the next day .
The clinic was in a stucco - fronted brick building opposite a roast beef sandwich shop in a sweaty suburb of Los Angeles known as the San Fernando Valley .
Panic attacks
One of the walls was taken up with a Salvador Dali poster showing swans merged with elephants : perfect for those who needed a hallucinogenic fix before they got their prescription .
A man behind the counter took my money ( $ 100 for a consultation ) and handed me a questionnaire .
One section dealt with my medical condition .
According to the rules you have to be virtually at death 's door , suffering from cancer , Aids or multiple sclerosis or in chronic pain in order to qualify .
The best I could come up with was anxiety .
I am the anxious type after all .
Protests were held after the owners of six medicinal marijuana dispensaries were arrested in May Soon , the doctor appeared - a softly - spoken Vietnamese man .
He wore a white lab coat and scrubs and led me into a spartan room where he proceeded to take my pulse and blood pressure before asking precisely how long I had been anxious .
" Several years , " I told him .
" Do you suffer panic attacks ? " " Not really . "
The doctor wrote panic attacks in his notebook .
We spent a few minutes shooting the breeze about Asian cuisine and he signed a prescription for medicinal marijuana , valid for a year .
And that was it .
Done and dusted in less than 10 minutes .
Aladdin's Cave My friend
Will was waiting for me when I got outside .
A concert oboist who once performed with Pavarotti , he had developed a deep affection for the herb during his time on the road , yet managed to conceal it from his fellow musicians even after once losing concentration in the middle of the Messiah and playing all the notes in the wrong order .
There was another episode - during a performance of Stravinsky - in which he became convinced he was Petrushka but that incident he blames on rogue hash brownies .
" You see , I told you , " Will beamed .
" This place is like Amsterdam . "
Will was keen to show me where he goes to buy his cannabis .
It was a short drive from the doctor 's office and recently voted dispensary of the year by one of the pot smokers ' magazines ( the most famous of which is , incidentally , called High Times ) .
With more than 200 dispensaries now operating legitimately the street dealers are all but obsolete and the state is happy because it collects the taxes
It was a nondescript building next to a Thai restaurant which contained cosy couches and a big picture of the Mona Lisa on the wall with that inscrutable grin and a fat joint in her right hand .
Who said pot smokers do not have a sense of humour ?
Will and I were buzzed through a metal gate by an attendant , who himself looked slightly buzzed , and ushered into a small room which could pass as an Aladdin 's Cave of narcotics .
Beneath a glass - topped counter were dozens of different varieties of weed laid out in plastic pots , and alongside them an arsenal of drug - taking paraphernalia including pipes and infusion implements , all in iridescent colours .
The different varieties of dope were listed on a white board .
They bore exotic names such as Maui Mist , Blue Dream and my personal favourite , Super Train Wreck .
Vending machines
My prescription did not place a limit on the amount of marijuana I could buy a day and I asked the man with the trippy smile behind the counter what he recommended for anxiety .
He pointed me in the direction of one called Purple Kush .
" How much should I take ? "
The naivety of the question seemed to catch my moon - faced pot sommelier off guard .
" I guess start with two or three puffs and see how you go ... "
Medicinal marijuana is outlawed by the US federal government
The benefits of medicinal marijuana to the seriously ill have been widely chronicled .
People with conditions such as cancer , arthritis and Aids say the drug helps make their symptoms bearable .
With more than 200 dispensaries now operating legitimately , the street dealers are all but obsolete and the state is happy because it collects the taxes .
Yet with some dispensaries installing vending machines in order to deal with out - of - hours customers you have to wonder if the situation is in danger of becoming a farce .
Getting on for 250,000 Californians are said to carry prescriptions for medicinal marijuana , and who knows how many of them - like me - suffer from little more than the occasional bout of self - doubt .
I did not buy any weed and I am thinking that one day I will frame my prescription and put it on the wall .
In the meantime - to paraphrase Bill Clinton - if I smoke , I certainly wo n't inhale .

What are these ?
Queensland Brain Institute ( QBI ) neuroscientists at UQ have discovered a new way to reduce neuronal loss in the brain of a person with Alzheimer 's disease .
Memory loss in people with Alzheimer 's disease can be attributed to several factors .
These include a build - up of the neuro - toxin Amyloid beta – the major component of amyloid plaques found in patients with Alzheimer 's – and corresponding degeneration of a specific population of nerve cells in the basal forebrain .
QBI neuroscientist Dr Elizabeth Coulson 's research was recently published in the Journal of Neuroscience .
She said the research had established that the molecule known as p75 neurotrophin receptor was necessary for the Amyloid beta to cause nerve cell degeneration in the basal forebrain .
During her research , Dr Coulson 's team found – both in cultured cells and in an animal model of Alzheimer 's disease – that it was possible to completely prevent Amyloid beta toxicity by removing the p75 cell death receptor .
" Discovering how Amyloid beta triggers neuronal degeneration has been a question bugging neuroscientists for decades , and we have identified an important piece of the puzzle , " Dr Coulson said .
These results provide a novel mechanism to explain the early and characteristic loss of brain cells that occurs in Alzheimer 's disease – which are known to be important for memory formation .
Dr Coulson already has patented molecules that can block p75 and is ready to begin testing them in animal models of Alzheimer 's disease .
" If such therapy is successful , it probably would n't cure this multifaceted disease , " Dr Coulson said .
" But it would be a significant improvement on what is currently available for Alzheimer 's disease patients . "
The World Health Organisation predicts that by 2040 , neurodegenerative conditions will become the world 's leading cause of death , overtaking cancer .
Alzheimer 's disease is the most common dementia affecting 10 per cent of people over 65 and 40 per cent over 80 years of age .
Significant advances in determining the molecular regulation of nerve cell function and survival have major impact on our understanding of more complex areas such as behaviour , cognition , aging and neurological diseases .

Europeans , rejoice !
With the Tesla Roadster finally rolling off an assembly line in Britain and the dollar tanking against the Euro , you 'll soon have a chance to buy a gorgeous all - electric sports car all your own .
With the dollar steadily falling against the Euro during the past year , the Tesla Roadster has grown more expensive to build because some components are sourced abroad and a lot of the construction is being done in Hethel , England .
Selling the car in Europe would provide the company a better balance between income and cost currencies , according to Innovation Beat .
Darryl Siry , VP of marketing , sales and service at Tesla , told the publication :
" We have always wanted to distribute in Europe , but with the low dollar we are going to move quicker .
The introduction date for the Roadster in Europe will be announced in a couple of months . "
Tesla has n't decided which countries might get it first , but InnovationBeat notes that Norway and Sweden are logical candidates because they offer tax incentives on low - emission vehicles , which effectively makes them cheaper .
With all of the 2008 models spoken for , it 's a safe bet Europe wo n't see the car until next year .
Although the company started full - scale production this week , do n't expect to see the cars flying off the assembly line .
Tesla 's building just one a week and wo n't pick up the pace for a month or two .
Siry told us Tesla is moving slowly so it can double - and triple - check absolutely everything and ensure there are n't any problems on the line or in the cars .
" We 're doing intensive quality control along the way , " he told us .
" We 'll ramp it up to two a week , then five a week .
That 's normal .
You only ramp up one you 're satisfied everything is up to quality . "
That 's a wise policy , particularly when your cars go for $ 98,000 .
At that price , customers will demand perfection .
The one - a - week pace at a Lotus factory will continue " for a couple of weeks " before slowly increasing to 30 .
" Thirty a week is the goal , " Siry said .
" The production plan we have gets us there toward the end of this year . "
The first car off the line goes to Martin Eberhard , the company 's deposed co-founder .
His Roadster has a custom matte gray paint job – Siry likened it to the aviator gray Audi used on the first generation TT – with an orange racing stripe .
" It 's really cool , " Siry said .
The factory turns out " gliders , " or rolling chassis without drivetrains .
The cars will be shipped – Siry said he imagines Eberhard 's car will be flown – to San Francisco for final assembly .
Every Roadster will have its battery pack , transmission and motor installed in San Carlos .
" The whole process before they 're passed to sales takes a couple of weeks , " Siry said , and Eberhard will probably get his car in April .
The first couple dozen cars will have modified one - speed transmissions that will be replaced once Tesla 's perfected what it calls Drivetrain 1.5 .
As we reported in " Tesla : The Cars Are Coming in March .
No - Really " , the early transmissions proved unreliable , so Tesla turned to a temporary fix so it could begin production .
Drivetrain 1.5 – which abandons the complex two - speed box originally planned for the car in favor of a one - speed transmission and improved power electronics module - is undergoing testing and certification .
Once it 's ready , Tesla will retrofit it into any cars that got the Band - Aid .
Siry said Tesla 's first week of production has gone smoothly , but then , it should have because " you spend an awful lot of time preparing for production .
We 've built 27 prototypes .
The first time you turn the assembly line on , you should n't have any surprises . "
The challenge now , he said , is making sure the supply chain keeps up with production as things ramp up .
" That 's where a lot of our attention is going right now . "
The first run of Roadsters is sold out – more than 900 people have placed deposits for the car – and the company is taking reservations for ' 09 models .
Tesla plans to sell about 1,800 cars next year and hopes to launch a four - door sedan in 2010 .
Development of that vehicle is well underway , and as we noted in " Tesla Gets $ 40 M , Says We'll See Sedan This Year " , could have a prototype by year 's end .
Siry says Tesla will give people a peek inside the factory next week when it posts pictures of the assembly process .

Thermodynamics of the corn-ethanol biofuel cycle , Tad W. Patzek , Critical Reviews in Plant Sciences 23 ( 6 ) , 519 - 567 , 2004 and The Real Biofuel Cycles
Transcript
Disclaimer :
This conversation was transcribed by a third party and may not be 100 % accurate .
Ben : Tad Patzek joins me over Skype to talk about the very important issue of the ethanol energy balance .
Tad is a professor in the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department at the University of California , Berkeley and he is well known in the bio-fuels industry because he offers the viewpoints that ethanol and in particular ethanol from corn requires more fossil fuel energy to make than the energy that ethanol offers us in return by burning it and using it to fuel our cars .
So , one pretty big consequence of this is that ethanol made from corn produces more CO2 than gasoline does .
So Tad , thanks so much for taking the time to come on the show and talk to me today .
Tad Patzek :
Thank you for having me .
Ben :
The first thing that I want to do is direct everybody or all the listeners to your website so that they can read your reports , titled Thermodynamics of the Corn Ethanol Biofuel Cycle , because that goes into some pretty good detail about what is included in energy balances and what your reasoning was to include or exclude some things from the energy balance .
So everybody listening , please I put up a link from thewattpodcast.com website so that you can read through Tad ’s documents and I especially like the idea of having a document like that , which is continuously refined .
Are those refinements based on reader comments , Tad ?
Tad Patzek : Yes .
I got a feedback from several people and I accounted for them but also some of them reflect my changing in thinking , for example , switching from the low heating value to the high heating value of fuels reflects the point of view that if you want to look at sustainability of an energy scheme , you want to account for the most you can get out of this regardless of how much you get in a given implementation , so that is just one example .
The second example that was a big discussion about how much energy goes into steel making process , so I have added [ 02:19 unintelligible ] on that and so it goes on , but I stopped updating this document .
I think the version that is on the web was stopped in February .
I wrote now a simpler and shorter document which is called The Real Biofuel Cycles , which is also on the web on my website and it does not go into the second law of thermodynamics which probably is sort of discouraging for some of the readers , although it makes most sense to use it .
So , in the second document I just used the first law of thermodynamics , the energy balance and the mass balance to show the overall energy efficiency of the corn ethanol cycle .
Ben : Okay .
Can you explain why the overall energy balance of ethanol is so important and what would be the impact to our society if we somehow manage to replace the 380 million gallons of gasoline that the US uses everyday with the biofuel like corn ethanol ?
Tad Patzek : Okay .
I think that we need to step back a little bit here .
Ben : Okay .
Tad Patzek :
We need to talk about a somewhat different issue .
You and I , as human beings continuously develop the power , that is , work over unit time of 100 watts .
So you and I continuously are about equivalent to 1 , 100 watt bulb switched on continuously .
That is what we need .
During the night we need less during the day we need more but on average it is about 100 watts .
Okay ?
So , that is us as human beings .
That is how are body is designed .
If you are Lance Armstrong a super , a strong human being , you in fact can develop the power of 300 or a little bit more watts for some time and it bursts of 600 watts and that makes him the best cyclist ever , but we are not as strong so 100 watts is a good number and in fact in order for us to develop this power , we need to eat about 2025 kilocalories per day and so that is our diet .
Of course we eat more in the United States , so that is why we become flabby and fat .
Ben : Yeah .
Tad Patzek :
So , if you look at this a consumption for 300 million people living in the United States over one year , all of us consume about 1 exajoule of energy , that is what we eat .
That is 1 followed by 18 zeros , okay ?
Now , as a country , as a society , we form a super organism of all of us together and then we become different beings and we use 105 exajoules per year of energy .
In other words , we use 105 times more energy as a society than we need to live .
So , if you compare a human heart as an individual you have to imagine let us say a V - Tec Honda engine , a 6 cylinder engine , as a member of our society so we are two different beings , one a biological human being and another one an industrialized member of a very large society that consumes a lot of energy at a very high rate .
Okay ?
That is the most fundamental point that I would really like people to think of that you use 100 watts as a human being , but you use 11,000 watts continuously as an American .
Ben : Even Americans per capita use them most energy in the world .
Well …
Tad Patzek :
That is right .
Ben : Yeah .
Well , actually Canadians use more energy than Americans .
Tad Patzek : Right , right , but it is very comparable .
We are at the top there .
The Canadians use a little bit more , but there is very few of them and they have huge landmass so they are not as dangerous to the earth as we are .
Ben : Yeah .
One of the reasons why we do that is because we drive so much .
Tad Patzek : Right .
Ben :
That is why we have to consume 380 million gallons of gasoline , so I guess that is why everybody is concerned right now about switching from gasoline or trying to find an alternative of gasoline .
Tad Patzek : Yes , right .
I know I need to focus on that , but let me just add one more comment .
So , in order for us to live the lifestyles we do , we need immense amounts of energy .
This includes also the energy as you said correctly required for us to drive .
So , now let us go back to nature .
The energy we use comes from reservoirs from stock of ancient solar energy , crude oil , natural gas , coal which have been accumulated over the last 300 million years or so .
They are accumulated at an incredibly low rate over an incredibly unimaginably long time .
We are using them now at the rate we need to be users of 11,000 watts per person per year continuously , but now we are running out of some of them , well not so soon , but we are , okay .
There is no doubt about it .
So , become scared because we have gotten used to our lifestyles and now we are saying , “ Okay , well if this resource is gone we ’re going to replace them with biofuels . ”
That is the big issue of our times right now in the United States and also worldwide .
The problem with this is that Mother Nature is absolutely unable to produce the fuels at the rate we want to use them .
There is a fundamental incompatibility between us as biological beings using 100 watts and us as mechanized beings using 11 kilowatts .
So , the whole question of replacing fossil fuels with biofuels is in fact ill - posed .
You can not do that .
You can not absolutely do that .
That is the first lesson here .
Ben : Without some amount of conservation .
Tad Patzek : No .
That is right .
Ben : Yeah .
Tad Patzek : Some is actually understatement , so let me just immediately jump to Brazil .
Ben : Okay .
Tad Patzek : Brazil is given as an example to us of a country that is successfully using bio fuels , right ?
Ben : Uh-huh .
Tad Patzek :
In fact , we are told that if we just behave like the Brazilians we will be okay , we will be supplying more than half of our fuel from biofuels .
Well , there is a problem with this argument .
There are 182 million Brazilians or so , there are 300 million Americans .
The Brazilians use 6 ½ billion gallons of gasoline per year and the Americans use 140 billion gallons of gasoline per year .
You do the ratios of the populations and the fuel used and it turns out that if you and I drive only once in two weeks , once in 14 days , so one day we drive , 13 days we walk or bike , then we become equivalent to the Brazilians .
So , I just want listeners to understand that in order for us to talk about biofuels playing an important role we would have to very , very dramatically change our lifestyles and that is actually not something that any of the listeners I presume is ready to do .
Ben :
We might be forced to do it one day .
Tad Patzek : Oh , yes .
In fact , that forcing is coming and much of it actually can be achieved with relatively little pain if we just pay a little bit of attention .
Let me give you another example .
We now use 21 million barrels of oil per day , 21 million barrels of oil per day .
Ben :
In the US , yes .
Tad Patzek : In the US .
The transportation uses about 2/3 of it .
Our cars , trucks , trains and planes use about 2/3 of it .
So , if we were to double the efficiency of our transportation system , that is , double the mileage of the cars , put more trains and fewer trucks , drive fewer things around , and increase the efficiency of our planes , we would be saving 7 million barrels of oil per day .
That is 7 million barrels of oil per day .
Now , without introducing anything radically novel or ravaging the environment with these huge monocultures that we now use to fool ourselves into believing that biofuels will solve our problems , but that requires discipline and that also requires political leadership from our government , which simply does not exist .
Ben :
Also just to bring you back to I guess ethanol in some fashion , ethanol is only 2/3 the energy density of gasoline .
Tad Patzek : Correct .
Ben :
And so you are actually going to be reducing your fuel efficiency if you move to ethanol .
Tad Patzek :
Well , right .
I mean you will have to essentially burn more of it to achieve the same distance .
That is correct , but again the main point I would like to sort of pass on to the listeners is this .
The volume of fuel regardless of its calorific content , for ethanol it is less , that is being supplied from biofuels stands in no proportion to the volume we need to sustain our lifestyles .
Okay ?
Ben : Yeah .
Tad Patzek :
That is sort of the crucial argument here , which we simply lost over because it is very difficult for us to understand the scale of the problem .
Ben :
Well , that is why some people are looking at ethanol because I know that there has been some disagreement as to whether or not ethanol does in fact use more fossil fuel energy than what it does in return .
Tad Patzek : Right .
Yes .
Well , we are stuck on this little argument and it basically boils down to throwing numbers across fences that is how I call it .
The listeners have to realize that in fact there is a little simplistic model of reality , which is called this net energy balance , which is not a balance at all , by the way .
It is a manipulation of certain inputs and outputs to the corn ethanol cycle from which there comes a number called the net energy ratio .
If you do sort of a more thorough job of balancing things and you could read this in this real biofuel cycles paper that is on the web on my website , you will find out that in fact it is not only the fossil fuels , but it is also the environment that we consume while we are producing these biofuels .
Let us start from the agriculture because that is the first link here .
The agriculture in Midwest is basically a desert paved with monocultures of greedy plants , which we bred to be standing in great crowds , very close to each other , and which need to survive .
They need lots of fertilizer and lots of human intervention .
Then these plants produce a lot of an industrial commodity , which is the # 2 yellow corns while using the soil and polluting one - half of the area of the United States and the coastal waters and the rivers and what have you , okay ?
So , the whole notion of that agriculture is in fact completely unsustainable .
That is a completely unsustainable transient state of agriculture supported by fossil fuels .
Ben :
It is completely unsustainable because of the fact that you are actually removing the nutrients from the soil without replacing them right ?
Is that how …
Tad Patzek : Right .
Well , in fact you have to replace them with fundamentally fossil fuels .
Ben : Yeah .
Yeah .
Tad Patzek :
The soil nitrogen , for example , cannot sustain these plants so you have to put a lot of fertilizers , let us say 200 kg of nitrogen per hectare of a cornfield .
This nitrogen is actually methane pure and simple with added energy .
You do that and you obtain your corn grain .
Then that corn grain has inside starch .
Starch is nowhere close to the desired product , which is ethanol , which chemically means you need to put a lot of energy to get from one to the other .
If you look again what you can do to that starch , you can liquefy it with enzymes , then you can ferment it with yeast , and then you distill the beer that you obtain to obtain 96 % spirit containing 96 % of ethanol and then you exclude the last 4 % with molecular sieves and then you add gasoline to it as a denaturant and that is your final product .
Ben : Yeah .
Tad Patzek :
The problem with this is that if you as you go through this process you in fact use on average seven times more energy per unit input energy , which is your corn grain , than you would in a normal petroleum refinery and the reason actually is very simple , corn is not ethanol .
Crude oil is very close to gasoline and diesel fuel .
It takes in fact much less energy to transform crude oil into gasoline and diesel than corn into ethanol .
Ben :
In converting corn into ethanol what is the most energy intensive step ?
I know that from reading your reports that the actually industrial process is more energy intensive than actually growing the corn , the agricultural step .
Is that true ?
Tad Patzek : Correct .
Yes , correct .
The single largest fossil fuel expenditure is in the distilleries , in the bio refineries .
Ben :
And would that be natural gas required to …
Tad Patzek : Now , you are asking an interesting question , right ?
So , almost all of these bio refineries have been designed to work on natural gas and they use huge quantities of natural gas .
In fact , they should be designed next to a major trunk not just a little pipeline , but a major pipeline , a gas pipeline .
Natural gas , as we all know , kind of increase in price a couple of times .
Three or four folds depending on where you started counting .
It becomes increasingly difficult to run these factories on natural gas ; therefore , they will be switching to coal and in fact they are .
Ben : Yeah .
That has already started .
Tad Patzek : Yes .
Now , think about this .
All of these plants have designed to burn clean natural gas .
They have no facilities to scrub and to flue gases from coal to dispose of coal ash and in fact they are also ill - designed to transport into them 300 - 400 tons of coal per day to each one of them .
Remember because the corn raw material is low density , these factories in fact are relatively small and dispersed , right ?
Ben : Yeah .
Tad Patzek :
There is some 30 of them in Iowa and they are dispersed on a grid sort of circles of 30 mile radius so they collect corn from a circle around them , which is around 30 miles in radius , which means that if you want to deliver coal to them you are going to have some logistical problems .
Ben : I know that they are struggling right now just to produce 2 % ethanol and gasoline so that they can be replaced with MTBE .
I know that they are going to have be building a lot more ethanol refineries .
Are those new ethanol refineries going to be easier on the environment ?
I mean …
Tad Patzek : No .
Ben :
They are not going to be any better .
Tad Patzek : No .
In fact , you remember that there is yet another bit of the story , which is not being told widely , the water used by these plants .
A 40 million gallon per year plant uses about 750,000 gallons of water per day .
That is so astronomical that I would like to encourage the users to compare this to their daily , I mean the listeners , to compare it to their daily water use .
Some of this water is recycled , but a significant portion of it is evaporated and also they need very fresh and soft water for the boilers , so you have to redo chemical treatment of the water and you need to take fresh water .
We are running out of water and especially in the western part of Midwest , there is a tremendous water shortage .
In fact these plants will have to move out from Midwest .
There is not enough environment for them to exist there anymore .
So they will have to go to the coasts , to the east and the west coast , and that is the plan , right ?
People are trying to build these plants in Pennsylvania , New Jersey , Colorado , Oregon , Washington State , etc .
So now , we are going to be faced with the problem of transporting gigantic quantities of corn from Midwest to the coast .
Ben : Yes .
Tad Patzek :
Also the west of course does not have too much water as well , as we all know , and in particular in California , building ethanol plants in the Central Valley , let us say in Fresno , it is sort of an idea of adding another major source of pollution and water use to the already most polluted environment in the United States .
That is kind of cute , but not for the people who live there .
Ben :
Are there any technological improvements that can make a significant improvement to the production of ethanol ?
Tad Patzek :
Well , okay , again I would like to warn you , yes there are , but no they are not going to resolve our major problem of incompatibility of the energy flux from the system and the energy flux that we need in order to sustain our lifestyles .
That can not be removed .
That is a law of nature .
We can actually tweak sort of at the edges of the system and we have , make no mistake about it .
The dry grind plant today to produce ethanol is much more efficient than the one that was in operation let us say 10 years ago .
People have done several things .
First of all , they try to buy to upgrade corn in a sense that they try to buy corn with the highest starch content .
Ben : Okay .
Tad Patzek : Still they use about 15 % of the corn that is produced in the United States .
They can upgrade the corn that they buy for the refineries vis -à - vis the starch content .
The second thing they do , they try to in fact digest a higher percentage of the starch that is available there , not all starch is fermentable , so they try to increase that percentage .
The next thing they want to do and they do it successfully is they increase the percent of ethanol in the beer .
It used to be 8 % now it is 10 - 12 % and people say you can go as high as 14 % , although I have my doubts because at that stage , fermentation really slows down and bacteria catching up and producing other byproduct , by the way which are incorporated into ethanol .
So when you buy ethanol in fact it will also contain the butyl alcohol and isopropyl alcohol and probably some other substances that you do not know about , it is no longer pure ethanol .
That is okay , you can burn butanol and isopropyl alcohol , your engine will not know .
Your engine will know about other substances that may find their way .
Improvements have been made , but again it does not change that the premise of the whole energy production system , an incredibly low - density , low - efficiency and low - yield energy supply scheme and this can not be changed .
This is how Mother Nature has designed it .
Ben :
So , we have identified that the largest energy input is the actual industrial process .
People are moving away from natural gas to coal power now because the price of natural gas is too volatile .
What if we started burning biomass instead of coal because biomass , some types of biomass such as pelletized switchgrass for instance has a fairly good energy balance , does it not , when you burn it .
Tad Patzek : Right .
So here we are running into another problem .
The thing about agricultural production is that it requires a substrate .
Plants need soil to grow on and that soil needs to be protected from the elements , wind and rain being the most important ones .
So a prairie system with switchgrass let us say protects the soil very well because the soil is covered with plants all the time .
Prairie in fact is a very good example of a system , which is enormously efficient and whose net productivity , that is , net mass production is zero .
That is , everything that the prairie produces is recycled in it .
The bison , the buffalo eat the grass .
The coyotes and the lions , mountain lions , eat the buffalo , and the wolves and everybody dies on the prairie and their bodies are recycled and so it goes on , the nutrients , and in fact the prairie gets flooded every now and then from the rivers , which bring other nutrients and so it goes on , the nutrients are resupplited .
Now we come , we the humans come into that system and we say , “ Okay , grass , we are going to cut you every year , year after year .
Remove everything that we cut and burn it elsewhere . ”
Unfortunately , when you do so not only do you remove carbon , but you remove nutrients with the grass and these nutrients are gradually depleted from the soil and of course the whole system stops producing .
There is a fundamental problem with removing all biomass from an ecosystem because that ecosystem stops functioning and in order for you to make it function , you have to resupply it back with the nutrients and that of course takes an enormous amount of fossil fuels .
So we are back to square one .
Ben : Okay .
I am so interested in the overall energy balance though .
Why is there so much confusion over the energy balance ?
Is there not some type of standards organization that says this is how you do an energy balance and this is how it should be done ?
Tad Patzek : Yes .
That is actually a very interesting question .
Yes , there are standards and in fact these standards were arrived at a long time ago in 1975 and in 1976 .
There was then a great interest in energy prices caused by the first problems that we had and there was the International Federation of Institutes for Advanced Study , which in fact gathered twice in Sweden , in Stockholm , and that organization provided guidelines for how energy balance should be done .
Of course these recommendations have all been forgotten by now .
In fact , there are some simple things that can be done .
Define your system clearly .
Corn ethanol system is an open system in which mass can flow through the boundaries and it does flow , which takes inputs from the environment and excretes output into the environment and so it is kind of difficult to do the balance .
First , we define the system and you can define the cornfields , the bio refineries and the machines that burn the ethanol , this can be done .
You can then define the system boundaries to go as deeply into the society as you please and there are guidelines as to how to do it .
This has not been followed by the studies , by most of the studies .
Now , the second thing you do is once you have defined the system boundaries now you can define the fluxes , the flows that go across these boundaries .
So , now you can balance mass which is # 1 requirement in science and then once you have balanced the mass you can balance energy , that is # 2 requirement .
None of these requirements were fulfilled in this net energy balance , that is , this net energy balance do not close mass or energy balances .
They violate both .
Depending on how you violated the mass or energy balance of your system , you can come up with different numbers and that is fundamentally what has been happening here .
Ben :
Is this also being done for gasoline as well because presumably it would be a good idea to compare the overall energy balance of corn ethanol for instance with gasoline ?
Tad Patzek :
Well , it has been done sort of , well sort of I would say more than sort of , there was a big study out of NREL , National Renewable Energy Lab , several years ago in 1997 , which attempted to do such a study for the crude oil diesel system and gasoline and diesel are in fact within a couple of percent the same thing in terms of energy consumption .
If you do this for the mixture of crude oil that comes here from the Middle East and as well on local supplies and you look at the mixture of refineries and the pipelines and what have you , you use on average 17 % of the energy in the crude oil to get from the crude oil under the ground in the reservoir to gasoline in your pump , that is 17 % .
So 83 % is left as the gasoline product on average .
Ben : Presumably that is dropping I mean in Canada .
Tad Patzek : Oh , yes .
Ben :
In Canada we are big on the Alberta in tar sands and that requires a lot of natural gas right now .
Tad Patzek : Yes .
In fact this is a very , very good point .
As we go on depleting this very rich and energy dense oil reservoirs in the Middle East and elsewhere , we are now turning towards more and more difficult oil , which takes more and more energy to not only recover it but also to convert it into a usable product , gasoline or something else , and that oil is increasingly more difficult on the environment .
Your Canadian example is a very good one .
That tar sands will require in the end all the natural gas that Canada has and it will also require all the water that Alberta has .
In the meantime , we are going to generate a lot of [ 32:42 unintelligible ] to upgrading that oil .
So the oil energy supply system becomes less and less environmentally friendly .
Of course , it never was friendly .
It was more and more unfriendly towards the environment .
However , as we are on this sort of efficiency , so the overall efficiency going from crude oil in the ground to gasoline , let us say , is 83 % , okay ?
Ben : Okay .
Tad Patzek :
If you want to go all the way from a corn seed to ethanol , the efficiency of that process , overall efficiency , is 20 % .
Ben : Okay .
Tad Patzek :
Well , plus-minus , that is 20 or 23 depending on how you do the calculation .
Now the big increase in the efficiency of that process comes from accounting for the coproduct , okay ?
Ben : Yes .
Tad Patzek :
If you do the following reasoning , because from corn grain we not only produce ethanol , but we also produce what is called DDGS or Dried Distillers Grain and Soluble , that is basically a mash of everything that is left from the corn grain other than starch .
Ben :
That is mostly used for feed , right , for the cattle feed ?
Tad Patzek : Right .
That is right .
Then you can play games as to how you apportion fossil energy you have used in the refinery to that portion of the corn grain .
This is kind of again a paper accounting because the fossil energy you expend on distillation is the energy you have expended , it is gone .
You have burned the coal ; you have burned the natural gas .
In fact , if you look at the refinery , the stage at which you separate starch from the rest of the corn grain does not require much energy at all .
You basically grind the corn grain and then you steep it in water and you put enzymes , Barley and alpha - amylase enzyme , to hydrolyze , to liquefy the starch .
You could separate the rest of the corn grain at that stage and expend almost no energy on it .
Ben : Okay .
Tad Patzek :
But you choose to in fact keep the two parts together and run them through the entire refinery , in the end you have to separate the solids from the distillation columns and you also have to dry them up and that takes an enormous amount of energy and then you say because I get a product out of this , I will apportion 30 % to 50 % of the fossil energy spent in the refinery to the coproduct and therefore my process looks better .
Ben : Yeah .
I also have to wonder if this co-product is made at any larger scale ?
Can we actually use it ?
Tad Patzek : No .
That is another problem .
Ben : Yeah .
Tad Patzek : Now , we are going back to a larger societal problem ; that is , because our farms produce so much of this industrial commodity , the # 2 yellow corn , as I said , we can not simply use it up .
We have decided to do three things with it , right ?
The first thing is to feed , not this , but white corn to the people as cornflakes , cereals and what - not , but that takes care of only 2 % of the corn .
The second thing that we decided to do is to basically run the corn through wet milling process and split it into the simple chemicals .
So , we get the snow white starch and we get dextrose , which is basically your cellulose and we can convert it into other sugars and we then produce the famous high fructose corn syrup and other chemicals , which show up on labels of almost any processed food product in the United States , that is the second use , but that takes care of about let us say 20 % of the corn , okay ?
But then we are left with the remainder and so we feed the remainder to the animals that are not eaten by people and in fact every animal in the United States eats corn these days including salmon , but then we are left with yet another overflow of corn in the fields , right ?
So we burn it , we feed our cars .
So now we have managed to feed people , animals and cars with corn .
That is a huge victory for the corn .
Nevertheless , some of the animals do not take kindly to that corn especially cows because cows have been designed to eat grass , cellulose , and in fact ferment the cellulose using bacteria in the rumen .
When they eat starch , they become sick .
Starch acidifies their stomachs .
It makes them fat .
It also destroys their livers .
In order to avoid being killed too early in the process , they have to be fed antibiotics .
Ben : Okay , so that is even more energy intensive .
Tad Patzek : Right , but not only that , it is just that there are limits to how much corn you can sort of pass through all the societal systems without destroying some of it .
Ben : Okay , so that is corn ethanol .
So , in summary , even if the overall energy balance looked okay , in summary , corn is an unsustainable crop because it depletes soil from all the nutrients .
Is that right ?
Tad Patzek : Right , but the overall energy balance does not look okay .
It is 20 %
Ben : Yeah .
True .
Tad Patzek : Yes .
Ben : Okay .
Now let us now move on to sugarcane for instance because sugarcane is sugar , sugar juices so it must be easier to produce ethanol from sugarcane than it is from corn grain .
Tad Patzek : Yes .
In fact , both corn and sugarcane are grasses , are seafloor plants .
Sugarcane is designed or by nature to live in moist and warm climate , which Brazil provides in large quantities .
Sugarcane grows around the year so all year long and it is being harvested twice a year in different parts of Brazil , in fact , much of it is still harvested by hand employing about one million people .
Now that is going away because these plantations are being mechanized right now .
Ben :
So they are becoming less organic farming ?
Is that what you are saying ?
Tad Patzek : Sugarcane has another feature that differentiates it from corn .
It actually coexists with a bacterium , Rhizobium bacterium , to some extent , which sequestered nitrogen .
So sugarcane needs less nitrogen fertilizer than corn .
Also , it grows year around not 100 days per year as corn does in the United States .
There are differences in the yield .
Also , sugarcane in the past centuries was grown organically with no fertilizers and basically what was taken out of the plantation in the end was the sugar juice , the carbon , in terms of sugar , but the rest of it and some fiber from the bagasse , but the rest of it would be returned back to the plantation as malt and as fertilizer and that would actually allow these plantations to go on for three centuries in some places .
Ben : Okay .
Tad Patzek : In Asia and in South America , so very good so far .
Now , we are now doing it slightly differently .
Now , in order for us to drive the process with sugarcane only , we need to use the entire plant , that is , the bagasse , the leaves and everything else and essentially bury them in the ethanol plants .
So now we are removing all biomass from the fields .
Of course , that puts us in the quandary that no we will have to be replacing the nutrients just as we do with corn .
In Brazil , this is not being done to the same extent yet .
So they are essentially depleting the soil and unfortunately they will have to do more and more fertilization as they go on with the system .
Ben : Okay .
Tad Patzek : Sugarcane has two things going for it , higher yield than corn and of course what is inside the sugarcane , the stem , is essentially juice that contains the sugar so you avoid a couple of steps and then you burn the bagasse , the rest of the plant , as fossil fuel and you get your ethanol relatively cheaply .
However , again , you are depleting the environment and the whole system , in the long run it has to be unsustainable .
Ben :
But it is a much longer run for Brazil .
Tad Patzek :
It is a longer run .
Yes .
Ben : Okay .
Now the last type of ethanol that I want to discuss just quickly is cellulose ethanol .
Hilary Clinton and all the politicians seem to want to produce cellulose ethanol instead of corn ethanol .
Why do they want to do that ?
Should they be focusing on cellulose ethanol at all ?
Tad Patzek :
Well , it is sort of like the next best thing in the horizon , right ?
Ben : Yeah .
Tad Patzek : Remember you still forgot about the algae .
Ben : Algae , yes .
Tad Patzek :
We will come back to it later on in some other program .
So cellulose in ethanol is the next best thing .
Now what I would like the listeners to understand is that all of these systems no matter what they are , sugarcane , corn , algae , and cellulose in ethanol , have about the same overall efficiency .
In fact , one I might argue that cellulose in ethanol would have a lower efficiency if we have the technology to produce it .
Let me sort of discuss this a little bit more .
The problem with cellulose is that cellulose is about the most sturdy and chemically inert compound that nature has produced over the last 2 billion years or so to protect plants from the attacks by animals , by elements , by fungi , bacteria , and what - not .
It is basically the substance that makes the plants last together with lignin , which provides it mechanical strength .
So by the very nature of it , cellulose is very difficult to decompose chemically and we can do that , of course , and we have been doing it very efficiently for many years , it is called the paper craft process right ?
Ben : Actually , there is a company in Canada just pretty close to me , Iogen , and they use a steam explosion method .
Tad Patzek : Right .
Ben : Sounds pretty energy intensive to me , steam explosion .
Tad Patzek : Yes .
That is right .
You put your finger right where it should be .
In order for us to get to cellulose , we need two things , we need lots of energy and thermal energy and mechanical energy , and we need time .
If we are very impatient then we need to put a lot of energy so what we do basically , we explode the plants by immersing them in steam or blowing steam through them .
Ben :
But you can create that steam using the lignin , right ?
Tad Patzek : Correct .
That is what you do .
Ben : Yes .
Tad Patzek :
But that is not the end of it .
So , now basically you have achieved a sort of smaller particles by exploding the cells , right ?
Now you need to digest these particles and you can this , for example , by attacking them with strong acid like sulfuric acid or strong hydroxide like sodium hydroxide , but then again takes a lot of energy and in fact the overall process would take more energy than you get out of it as ethanol or you can be more patient and at that stage you can in fact try to use enzymes , but enzymes have a very difficult task at hand , they have to attack this inert particles , which are now more exposed by exploding them , but they are still very inert , so it takes time .
When you spend enough time digesting cellulose , unfortunately the bacteria that exist on the biomass , you cannot disinfect the biomass altogether .
Start recovering and start competing for the biomass .
In the end you would produce methane and if you have access to air acids , but not sugar and ethanol .
The problem with all of these schemes is the are very low efficiency , that is , the yield of ethanol per ton of biomass is in fact quite low and very high energy requirement so if you care to ask Iogen what is their yield efficiency , I have asked them by E- mail and I have also forwarded my E-mail to their Shell sponsors and I got no answer to that .
That is one of the deeply held secrets as to how many tons of biomass do I need to put in to get the ethanol that I get out of such a plant ?
Ben : I was always led to believe that cellulose ethanol has a quite good energy balance .
Tad Patzek :
Well , again , it depends on how you do the balance , right ?
Ben : Yes .
Tad Patzek : Again , one has to be very careful to define the system boundaries .
The way it is done right now is that basically you get your biomass for free , you call it trash , which is okay , but then remember that the trash also has nutrients , which will remove from the parent ecosystem and at some point you will start to have to put them back into the ecosystem .
That is one .
The second one that people do is sort of this naïve scaling , that is , if I have a small plot of switch grass and I cut it once or twice and I get 10 tons per year , I will from that conclude that therefore I will obtain 10 tons of biomass from each hectare of switchgrass anywhere for any number of years and that is of course not true .
As you go on , your yield in fact can decline from 10 to 2 tons or the switchgrass can die as they do very often in a couple of years .
The question of yield is # 1 , the question of putting the nutrients back is # 2 , and the question of having a technology that would actually yield the ethanol from the biomass at certain efficiency without using too much energy is # 3 , and I do not think we have answered any of these questions with cellulose in ethanol .
Ben : Okay .
Yeah , this is running a bit long now so you must be getting tired , but how can we make the world more sustainable ?
Of course , conservation is important , but what is the solution , then ?
Tad Patzek :
Well , there are not any solutions .
Let me be very blunt about this .
There are two fundamental solutions , one is to limit the human population , there is just too many of us .
Again , many people will raise their eyes , but again talking about energy solutions without talking about the population problems is just like mopping the floor with the faucets running on .
So that is # 1 problem .
The second problem is that we will have to start using much less energy per capita , but that will bring us way towards the societies from which we have differentiated ourselves , that is , to rule out Indian - ruled China , let us say , and that is not a very pleasant perspective .
However , having said that , the earth is finite and the same rule of populations in China and India look at us , watch our TV , and want to live like us .
The problem is that there is not enough of the world for all of us .
Somehow we will either have to adjust to it or something really bad will happen to all of us .
Ben :
But I know that you are a proponent of photovoltaic , right ?
Tad Patzek : Yes .
Ben : Because they can capture much more of the sunlight .
Tad Patzek :
That is right .
Ben : Okay .
Tad Patzek :
That is right .
Photovoltaic , again , do not get me wrong , within the confines of using less energy and modifying our lifestyles , there are things that we can do better , one of them would be to use photovoltaic to a much larger extent that we do now and a photocell is 200 times more efficient in terms of producing work than biomass .
So , you have [ 50:28 unintelligible ] of magnitude of advantage .
We are not producing these solar cells in large enough quantities that is because of manufacturing problems , but that is a separate story .
We need to go a lot more toward solar cells , but again if we do we will have to sleep at night , work during the day , take time off when it is cloudy , and just live different lifestyles .
Ben : Okay .
Well , thank you so much , Tad , for coming on the show .
Tad Patzek : Alrighty .
Ben :
Thanks a lot .
Tad Patzek : Bye - bye .
Ben : Bye .
" Can that man sitting on the steps please move , " the invisible voice booms .
Then louder .
" That man on the steps who is blocking the way .
Please move . "
Then , infuriated : " You , that man in the brown overcoat , there 's no reason to block the steps .
You are holding up people who want to use the stairs . "
Finally , the tired commuter who has been held up to us all as the cause of our mutual subterranean unhappiness , realises he has been made the scapegoat .
The woes of Town Hall station are all his fault .
He slinks off to join the other miserable but upright commuters .
It does not stop there .
" The all - stations train to Bankstown is now at Circular Quay … the train should be here in about two minutes .
So just be patient , " the voice booms .
We know that .
It says so on the board .
" Can passengers please stay behind the yellow line while the train approaches . "
I would gladly do so if a three - person deep crowd was not exploding behind me .
" Those people crowding the train doors - you are a danger to yourselves as well as to others . "
No , the real danger here is that nothing has been done to upgrade this station to cater for today 's crowds .
But on it goes .
The voice is relentless , monotonous and narky .
" We all want to get home , and pushing and shoving wo n't make things happen more quickly . "
We do n't know what 's good for us , is the message , and CityRail is going to make sure we understand .
If there was any real concern about overcrowding at Town Hall station , designed in 1916 , then new exits would be created .
It can take an eternity in peak hour just to get on the escalator from the bowels of the station .
A fire down there would be … well , it 's not worth thinking about .
If there was any concern about the risk of commuters falling from platforms the station would be redesigned so those waiting were not forced on top of one another .
And if there was any thought at all about commuter comfort there would be more than just token seating ( I , too , have had to sit on the stairs - when eight months ' pregnant ) and a real attempt to fix the stifling conditions .
In 2005 , when RailCorp announced a multi-million - dollar plan to upgrade Town Hall , the tender package warned that the station was a serious danger to the public .
Last month the Herald revealed that a report by Parsons Brinckerhoff found the station " cannot currently be fully evacuated in the morning and evening peaks within times stipulated by [ the fire safety standard ] " .
RailCorp said a widening of the main concourse and ticket barrier expansion had improved access , but the projected commuter growth remained unaccounted for .
Within eight years 168,000 people would pass through the station each day , up from about 140,000 now .
By 2021 there will be 178,000 .
For more than 10 years I have used the station to get to work , but it is only this year that have had to do so in peak hour .
In that time I have had trouble breathing in sauna - like conditions ; had to tiptoe around pools of blood and been caught on overcrowded trains where people were forced to travel to the next stop while jammed helplessly against the doors .
Many times I have thought how easy it would be to fall off the narrow platforms , or to be accidentally pushed off .
Just one person losing their footing would do it or - perhaps more likely - just one person losing their mind .

North Korea has handed over a long - awaited account of its nuclear programme to China .
The declaration , which is six months overdue , is expected to detail North Korea 's plutonium production efforts .
But analysts believe it will not go into detail about the country 's nuclear arsenal or its alleged uranium enrichment programme .
US President George W Bush cautiously welcomed the move but said the US still had " serious concerns " about Pyongyang .
He said he was notifying Congress of his intent to take the communist state off a US list of state terrorism sponsors in 45 days - if the declaration was complete .
Symbolic act " The United States has no illusions about the regime in Pyongyang , " Mr Bush told a White House press conference .
" We remain deeply concerned about North Korea 's human rights abuses , uranium enrichment activities , nuclear testing and proliferation , ballistic missile programmes and the threat it continues to pose to South Korea and its neighbours . "
North Korea remains one of the most sanctioned regimes
Stephen Hadley
US National Security Adviser
The handover is part of six - party efforts offering North Korea diplomatic and economic incentives to disarm .
Mr Bush announced the lifting of sanctions under the Trading with the Enemy Act , but confirmed that other measures against the Pyongyang regime would remain in place .
" It will remain one of the most heavily - sanctioned nations in the world , " Mr Bush said .
The US Treasury said sanctions on weapons proliferation , illicit financing activities and money laundering were unaffected by Mr Bush 's announcement .
And officials said Washington could re-impose sanctions if Pyongyang failed to live up to its expectations .
The US state department said Pyongyang 's declaration would be subjected to an " iterative process of verification " aimed at resolving discrepancies and achieving a " complete and correct " declaration .
This process will include : Reviewing 19,000 pages of documentation relating to North Korea 's nuclear activities dating back to 1986 , which was handed over last month
Being given short - notice access to declared or suspect sites related to the North Korean nuclear programme
Being given access to additional required documentation and nuclear materials for sampling
Interviewing personnel in North Korea Thorny negotiations South Korean Foreign Minister Yu Myung - hwan said it would be " regrettable " if North Korea 's declaration lacked details of Pyongyang 's nuclear stockpile .
NORTH KOREA NUCLEAR DEAL 2002 : N Korea pulls out of previous deal after US accuses it of having secret uranium programme October 2006 : North Korea carries out its first test of a nuclear weapon February 2007 : N Korea agrees to end nuclear activities in return for aid July 2007 : North Korea closes its Yongbyon nuclear reactor and allows IAEA inspectors in December 2007 : N Korea misses a deadline to hand over a declaration of its nuclear work June 2008 : N Korea hands over nuclear programme details ; US cautiously welcomes the move
Why N Korea handed data over George Bush statement in full News of the handover came from the Chinese and South Korean foreign ministries .
In North Korea itself , a senior US diplomat and media have been invited to witness the destruction of a nuclear cooling tower at its Yongbyon reactor on Friday , in an apparent show of commitment to the deal .
Since agreeing to end its nuclear activities in February 2007 , North Korea has shut down the reactor .
But reaching agreement with North Korea on the next stage of the disarmament deal - the declaration - has proved a tough task .
Analysts say the most thorny part of the negotiations will focus on what happens to any nuclear bombs and weapons - grade material .
Another expected gap in Thursday 's declaration is any disclosure on how the North allegedly helped Syria build what the Americans say was a nearly - completed nuclear reactor .
BBC diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus says the Syrian facility - destroyed by Israeli warplanes in September 2007 - was strikingly similar to the Yongbyon reactor .
He also says that with opinion on Capitol Hill running strongly against Pyongyang , Congress may seek to block any White House move to remove North Korea from its terror blacklist .
Japan , meanwhile , is concerned de-listing North Korea as a terror sponsor could marginalise its efforts to trace Japanese nationals abducted by Pyongyang 20 years ago .

The investment banker Robert Wolf first met Barack Obama one afternoon in December in a midtown conference room .
Obama was in town to deliver a speech at a charity dinner for children in poverty at the Mandarin Oriental — but also to pursue another , less high - minded , but more momentous , objective : to begin the process of attempting to pick Hillary Clinton ’s pocket .
The conference room belonged to George Soros , the billionaire bête noire of the right .
After talking to Soros for an hour about his prospective bid for the White House , Obama walked down the hall and found assembled a dozen of the city ’s heaviest - hitting Democratic fund - raisers : investment banker Hassan Nemazee , Wall Street power Blair Effron , private - equity hotshot Mark Gallogly , hedge - fund manager Orin Kramer .
Most had been big - time John Kerry backers in 2004 .
Most had a connection to the Clintons .
All were officially uncommitted for 2008 .
Comparatively speaking , Wolf , now the CEO of UBS Americas , was a buck - raking neophyte .
But his prodigious recent efforts ( first for Kerry , then for House and Senate Democrats in 2006 ) had established him as a rising star in the fund - raising firmament .
Until a few weeks earlier , the presidential horse he ’d planned to ride in 2008 was former Virginia governor Mark Warner .
But with Warner ’s decision to forgo the race , Wolf was up for grabs — and in the sights of every Democrat in the field .
What Wolf , 45 , was looking for was a candidate who could change the tenor of our politics .
“ I ’d like my children to soon see a president give a State of the Union address and have both parties applaud , ” he tells me .
But Wolf was looking , too , for a campaign where his presence would be “ impactful , ” for a candidate who would take his calls , listen to his ideas .
He wanted to feel the love .
And while Wolf refuses to speak ill of Clinton , it ’s clear he doubted that , no matter how much dough he raised , he ’d ever be feeling it from her .
Wolf was wowed by Obama that afternoon : his straightforwardness , his “ bold and impressive ” early stance against the Iraq war .
He handed Obama his card and said , “ I ’d like to get to know you more . ”
Obama phoned the next day .
“ When we hung up , he said , ‘ I ’ll call you after the holidays , ’ and I ’m thinking , Yeah , right , he ’s gonna call me , ” Wolf says .
But call Obama did .
The next week , they had dinner in Washington , just the two of them , on the night that George W. Bush gave his speech announcing the surge of additional troops into Iraq .
“ I felt so honored to be sitting down with him for two hours on an occasion like that , ” Wolf recalls , “ knowing that he was going off to be interviewed on television later . ”
Within ten days , Obama had announced his intention to run and Clinton was officially in .
A story in the Times reported that Obama had nailed two A - list New York donors : Soros and Wolf .
But though Soros ’s backing was a symbolic coup , it ’s Wolf who has emerged as Obama ’s most copious cash collector in the city so far — hosting two high - dollar cocktail parties , making countless calls , harvesting more than $ 500,000 .
As Wolf tells me about the soirées he ’s hosted , he reaches into a meticulously organized scrapbook , takes out a photograph of him and Obama grinning madly , and tells me that I can keep it .
“ The way Barack has taken this nation with his rock - star status , ” he says , “ it ’s very exciting ! ”
The courtship of Robert Wolf is , of course , part of a larger story : How Obama , from a standing start three months ago , built a fund - raising apparatus as powerful as Clinton ’s .
How Obama ’s people , tapping a national hunger for something new and fresh , along with the unease of many Democrats about Clinton , ginned up more money for use in the primaries than she did .
How they kicked her ass on the Internet and tapped twice as many donors overall .
How they even held their own against the Clinton machine in New York .
How Obama , that is , won the money primary — or , at least , its first installment — and arguably turned himself into the race ’s co-front - runner .
New Yorkers have long understood the money primary and its importance in signaling a candidate ’s plausibility .
In a deep - blue city where the Democratic primary has traditionally taken place too late to matter , the battle for cash is the one contest in which New Yorkers ( a certain class of New Yorkers ) have been able tangibly to influence the selection of the party ’s nominee .
As Julius Genachowski , a high - tech player and law - school friend of Obama ’s , puts it , “ Other states vote ; New York invests . ”
Yet the context in which the money primary is taking place this year is radically different from before .
With some two dozen states , including ours , now planning to hold primaries on February 5 , the ability to raise vast quantities of early cash is seen by many operatives as essential — not just to create a perception of strength but to build a viable organization .
“ I say this all the time :
It ’s over on February 5 , ” argues Terry McAuliffe , Clinton ’s campaign chairman .
“ To raise money to compete in Texas , California , Florida , New York , Illinois , New Jersey , and Michigan , all on one day — extraordinary ! ”

Thus the lunatic pace and scale of the campaign now unfolding : a race that seems hopped up on steroids and speed simultaneously .
With all three top - tier Democratic candidates having rejected federal spending limits for the primaries , experts reckon the race overall may consume over $ 1 billion , in excess of the GDP of more than a few small countries .
On the Republican side , Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are on the air with advertising ( nine months before the first ballots are cast , for heaven ’s sake ) .
And Democrats are turning out in thousands - strong crowds for Obama , Clinton , and John Edwards — portending a campaign of mind - boggling ferocity and unpredictability .
This sooner - bigger - faster dynamic was supposed to be Clinton ’s friend .
With her purportedly unmatchable capacity to raise stratospheric sums , she seemed to be on an inexorable march to the nomination .
But with Obama ’s show of fund - raising strength — and Edwards ’s , too — that scenario has flown out the window .
“ The air of inevitability is gone , ” says a mega - fund - raiser for Clinton in New York .
“ Not everyone in the campaign believed this before , but we ’ve got a race on our hands . ”
The putative Clinton juggernaut was launched on February 6 , with a dinner at her house in Washington .
In attendance were 70 of Clinton ’s top - shelf fund - raisers from around the country , including New York financiers Alan Patricof and Steve Rattner .
The following day , more than a hundred so - called Hillraisers — donors pledged to pulling in at least $ 25,000 each — filed into the Hyatt Regency for briefings by Clinton ’s senior strategists , who offered presentations designed to reinforce her status as the unequivocal , eminently electable , Democratic front - runner .
For weeks already , the Clinton finance team had been working to lock up as many premier bundlers — people proficient at accumulating piles of other people ’s checks — as possible .
Nowhere was the effort more avid than in New York , especially when it came to bundlers flirting with Obama .
In short order , the campaign landed Nemazee and Effron , along with PR executive Robert Zimmerman , who ’d raised money for Bill Clinton and Al Gore but was keeping his mind open about 2008 .
“ The Obama outreach was sophisticated , cleverly orchestrated ; I met with him and was impressed , ” says Zimmerman .
“ But it was n’t a hard call .
Hillary has the experience and knows how to beat the Republicans , and I ca n’t stress enough how important that is . ”
Other Clinton fund - raisers , however , rendered their decision more on the basis of personal cost - benefit analyses .
“ I ’ll probably be a chicken and go with Hillary , ” one confided months ago .
“ Everybody thinks I ’m going to .
It ’s easy to explain .
I have a long relationship with her , I do like and respect her , I ’d be happy if she won .
So I can support her , frankly , without pissing off Barack or anyone else .
But if I support Barack , I ’d piss off a bunch of other folks — and who needs that ? ”
The Clinton rollout amounted to a show of overwhelming force , the fund - raising equivalent of shock and awe .
The list of boldface names behind her was endless : Roger Altman , Fred Hochberg , Stanley Shuman , Carl Spielvogel .
Though Clinton proclaimed that she hoped to raise $ 15 million in the first quarter and $ 75 million by the end of the year , both record - breaking goals , the consensus in political circles was that these were plainly lowball numbers .
Reports in the press stated that the campaign was calling on its upper - echelon bundlers to reap at least $ 250,000 and as much as $ 1 million each .
One such bundler , New York supermarket magnate John Catsimatidis , boasted to the Web magazine the Politico , “ She ’s going to raise more money than all the other candidates put together . ”
To a great degree , presidential fund - raising is an expectations game :
Set them low , then blow them away .
But , curiously , the Clinton campaign seemed to be lifting the bar rather than depressing it .
“ There are a lot of people who give to who they think is going to win ; they want to be on the winning team so they can be an ambassador or who the hell knows what , ” observes a Clinton bundler .
“ Adopting a we ’re - gonna - crush - everyone approach was a way to attract as many of those people as possible . ”
Yet alongside the aura of invincibility , the Clinton team projected something else : a tacit message that it was time for big - dollar Democrats to choose between Obama and Hillary .
On the bus or off the bus .
No hedging allowed .
And apostates would pay a price .
For some in the party , the tactic struck a nerve .
“ It ’s almost like a shakedown — you ’re with us or you ’re not , ” Jim Neal , a North Carolina investment banker who was on an early conference call with McAuliffe , told the Times .
“ I find the squeeze , this early , to be quite vulgar …
It ’s a bullying tactic . ”

McAuliffe reacts with outsize outrage to suggestions of strong - arming .
“ Give me one example !
One example of one individual who works for this campaign who has ever threatened anyone !
It has n’t happened , ” he tells me .
“ People rumor about the Hillary Clinton campaign all the time .
But I ’ve probably spoken to 15,000 or 20,000 people in this campaign so far , and I have n’t had one complaint from one person I ’ve spoken to . ”
Patricof says the same .
“ I did n’t have to drag anyone kicking and screaming into this , ” he tells me .
“ And I would never say , ‘ You ’re either with us or against us ’— it ’s not in my vocabulary . ”
Some Obama backers acknowledge that the widespread accusations of Clintonian heavy - handedness are overblown .
“ [ Clinton finance director ] Jonathan Mantz does n’t do that , ” says an Obama bundler .
“ In this game , you have a thousand agents out there — who knows what they ’re saying ? ”
He goes on , “ The pressure they exerted comes from trying to create this steamroller effect :
‘ We have the most resources , the most talent , the most endorsements , so we ’re going to win . ’
The dynamic is n’t , ‘ You ’re with us or against us . ’
It ’s , ‘ You ’re with us or you ’re a moron . ’ ”
Even loyal denizens of Clintonworld do n’t bother to dispute that .
They also note the Clintons have elephant memories and value loyalty above all .
The result is a realm where threats are unnecessary , because they are implicit : the threat of ostracism , in particular , of being banished from the charmed circle .
“ There are some people the Clintons consider Clinton people who have gotten behind Barack , ” a longtime friend of Bill and Hillary ’s explains to me .
“ And there will be total retribution if the opportunity presents itself . ”
Total retribution ?
You ’re joking , right ?
“ I ’m not joking .
They ’re not going to audit somebody ’s tax return or anything .
But once you ’ve been in the Clinton camp , once they think you ’re part of the team , once you ’ve helped them and they ’ve helped you and you then go somewhere else — I just think it ’s very hard to crawl back into their good graces .
I ’m not saying it wo n’t happen .
But they wo n’t forget .
They may take you back eventually , but they wo n’t forget . ”
Two weeks after his dinner in Washington with Obama , Robert Wolf found himself supping there with the senator again , in a private room at the Ruth ’s Chris Steakhouse near Dupont Circle .
But this time , their meal was by no means à deux .
Around the table sat the members of Obama ’s embryonic New York finance committee : fund manager Jim Torrey ( whose daughter is on the staff of this magazine ) ; Provident Group partner Brian Mathis ; Citibank executive Michael Froman ; private - equity manager Jamie Rubin ; and Orin Kramer .
Kramer had yet to sign on to support Obama ; he was doing due diligence .
But everyone understood what a score bringing him onboard would be .
At 61 , Kramer was a Clinton stalwart who ’d piled up mountainous stacks of cash for Gore and Kerry .
“ Orin sort of owns New Jersey when it comes to raising money , ” says Torrey .
When the dinner was over , Kramer and the others raced to catch the last shuttle back to New York .
At the airport , Froman and Mathis kept prodding him to pull the trigger .
“ All right , enough already ! ” Kramer said , pulling out his cell phone and calling Mantz to break the news that he was defecting .
Kramer had been mulling the decision , tortured by conflicting feelings , for weeks .
“ I ran up against my pain threshold , ” he said at the time .
“ I have unalloyed respect for Senator Clinton … But despite being a dinosaur , I ’m drawn to a different kind of political experience . ”
Moreover , Kramer had concluded , contrary to the conventional wisdom then , that Obama had a chance to win .
“ The market has mispriced him , ” Kramer told friends .
“ The street thinks he ’s a 5 - to - 1 underdog , but I think he ’s undervalued . ”
Kramer was by no means the only migrant from Clintonworld to Obamaland .
“ The first part of the calculus was about the civic good , ” one former administration official tells me .
“ Who would be a better president ?
It ’s a toss - up — maybe Hillary on the margin .
But the likelihood is that whoever you support is going to lose , that ’s just the odds , so it should matter who’d be the better candidate — I mean , better for the country .
And I thought Obama , simply by being a candidate and by virtue of the policies and values he ’d espouse as a candidate , had a chance to change the country .
The second part is the personal : The Clintons are basically disloyal people .
They have a huge track record of jettisoning people far closer to them than I am on the slightest political pretext .
Loyalty has to be a two - way street .
I do n’t think they ’ve earned the right to play the loyalty card . ”

Other Obama bundlers simply found the prospect of plumping for Clinton too depressing to bear .
“ Hillary has the same problem that Gore and Kerry had , ” says one .
“ There are people who believe passionately in her , but a lot have reservations about her electability .
I can raise a lot of money for Barack because people are enthusiastic about him .
But if I go out and raise money for Hillary , it ’s like I ’m taxing my friends . ”
One unsurprising aspect of Obama ’s New York fund - raising network was its ebony hue : the presence of high - profile black bundlers , such as publisher Earl Graves and music executive Andre Harrell .
But the most striking element of its composition was n’t racial but generational : Unlike the Clinton side , which was dominated by folks in their fifties , the Obamans were mostly in their forties .
“ One thing we recognized early on , ” says David Axelrod , the campaign ’s chief strategist , “ was that there is a substrata of people who in past campaigns were n’t allowed to sit at the adult table but who all of a sudden were quite formidable . ”
Many of Obama ’s baby bundlers cut their teeth in Bill Clinton ’s administration .
Mathis and Froman both worked in the Treasury Department , while Rubin , son of Bob , had been a staffer at the Federal Communications Commission .
There was also Josh Steiner , another Treasury hand and now a partner of Steve Rattner ’s at the Quadrangle Group .
And others had no Clintonian association , but were emerging fund - raising powerhouses , such as former Goldman Sachs golden boy Eric Mindich .
At the heart of the next - gen cadre were Froman and Mathis , both law - school classmates of Obama’s .
Together , they recognized that , whereas the Clinton fund - raising corps represented the financial elite tossed up by the LBO and M&A booms of the eighties , they were in a position to mine the vein of freshly minted money spawned by the hedge - fund and private - equity eruptions of the new millennium .
The players behind those booms had no loyalties , and owed no debts , to the Clinton dynasty .
They were looking for a candidate to call their own .
“ In Barack ’s speech in Selma [ earlier this year ] , ” a baby bundler says , “ he talked about the Moses generation and the Joshua generation in the civil - rights movement .
It ’s sorta the same story here . ”
He continues , “ If we all lined up for Hillary , we would n’t have even gotten into the anteroom , let alone had seats at the table — there ’s no more room .
It would ’ve been , ‘ You have an idea ?
Send us an e-mail and we ’ll have someone get back to you .
Oh , and do n’t forget to send those checks . ’
But that ’s not how it is with Barack .
We ’re already at the table . ”
Then there was Julius Genachowski , who for years was Barry Diller ’s go - to guy at InterActiveCorp .
Genachowski connected Obama to another pool of money : technology and media .
Co-hosting fund - raisers in New York and Washington ( with former FCC chairs Reed Hundt and Bill Kennard ) , he helped raise more than $ 600,000 .
And he focused on Obama ’s Internet operations , persuading the campaign to hire both a private - sector tech wizard and one from the political world .
Today , Obama ’s
Web presence is best in show — a crucial asset in the dollar derby .
By early March , when Obama hit New York on a fund - raising swing , the sense of momentum was palpable .
On a Monday night , Obama crammed in a quartet of parties : two hosted by Wolf , one by Edgar Bronfman Jr. , one at the Park Avenue home of music impresario Antonio “ LA ” Reid .
“ We had Beyoncé and Patricia Duff , Jay - Z and Jamie Rubin , Jermaine Dupri and Jonathan Soros , ” Mathis says about the Reid affair .
“ We raised north of $ 350,000 in two hours .
And that ’s when it became crystal clear to all of us :
We can raise this money . ”
For all the campaigns , March ended in a flurry .
A story in the Daily News provoked spasms of fear and trembling for the Obama and Edwards people : Hillary Clinton had apparently raised $ 10 million in one week .
But there were reasons to wonder if the Clinton people were getting twitchy , too :
In the last six weeks of the quarter , the campaign had dispatched Bill Clinton to a startling sixteen fund - raisers .
Inside the campaign , there were no worries about their final number — it would be gargantuan .
But Team Clinton was hearing “ rumbles , ” McAuliffe told me later , about an Obama surge .
“ I probably made 1,500 calls this quarter , ” McAuliffe noted .
“ And there ’s not a donor I called that Obama did n’t call three , four , five times .
So I knew he was working hard .
I knew he was doing well on the Internet .
And I knew someone was going to capture this antiwar stuff like Howard Dean did . ”
The antiwar stuff was also fueling Edwards ’s fund - raising efforts .
The former North Carolina senator was expected by no one to come close to matching his rivals ’ tallies — especially in New York , where his populism made him less palatable to many Wall Street donors .
Still , on the last day of the quarter , when I visited Brian Mixer , Edwards ’s New York finance director , in his office near Union Square , Mixer was serene .
“ We ’re going to more than double what we did in primary money in New York in the first quarter of 2003 , ” Mixer said with evident satisfaction .
“ We raised a million then — and we ’ll do $ 2.5 million this time . ”
Leo Hindrey , the former CEO of the YES Network and one of Edwards ’s prime bundlers , told me , “ The Clinton people think they own New York — but what they ’re finding out is that it ’s true for the Senate but not for the presidency . ”
Mixer added , “ What we ’ve heard is that they tell people , ‘ If you give money to us , you ca n’t give to anyone else . ’
We say , ‘ We understand she ’s your senator , but why not help us out , too ? ” Mixer pauses .
“ Hey , we ’re doing fine — there ’s a lot of money in New York . ”
Precisely how much would not become clear for another two weeks , the deadline for the campaigns to file detailed reports with the Federal Election Commission .
But 24 hours later , Clinton ’s first - quarter total became public — via the Drudge Report , no less .
The number was indeed staggering : $ 36 million .
But not as staggering as it appeared .
For one thing , it included $ 10 million left over from her Senate race last year .
And of the remaining $ 26 million , some ( though the campaign did n’t disclose the figure ) had been raised for the general election .
By leaking the $ 36 million figure , the Clinton team was hoping to garner one news cycle in which their results would be seen in the most flattering light .
And by not revealing their primary number , they would deny the press the ability to do an immediate comparison with Obama ’s — which they suspected might be larger than hers .
They were right about that , but they would have to wait awhile to discover just how right .
Displaying their own media savvy , Obama ’s people let anticipation mount for three days before unveiling their numbers .
Speculation flooded the political ether : $ 20 million ?
$ 21 million ? $ 23 million ?!
More , in fact : $ 25 million , an astonishing figure for a start - up campaign , all the more so because $ 23.5 million was for the primaries — more than Clinton ’s total .
( By law , the maximum individual donation to presidential candidates is $ 2,300 for the primaries and the same for the general election , and whereas Obama ’s fund - raisers , as a rule , collected only primary cash , the Clintonites held many $ 4,600 events . )
And what of New York ?
Not surprisingly , the Clinton number was gigantic : more than $ 8 million .
But Obama ’s was nothing to sneeze at : more than $ 4 million .
Consider , for a start , that Clinton raised next to nothing in Chicago ( this in spite of its being her actual hometown ) .
And consider the likelihood that Clinton has tapped out her high - dollar donor base in the city , while Obama ’s new - money brigade is expanding as contributors are transformed into bundlers .
Ten minutes after the Obama press release hit my in - box , I phoned one of Clinton ’s most potent fund - raisers in the city .
So : $ 25 million total , $ 23.5 million for the primary , 100,000 donors , I said .
“ Wow . ”
Surprised ?
“ I think everybody will be surprised .
Her number was what they always told us it was going to be .
But the idea that he would get as far as he got , I do n’t think anyone thought it was possible . ”
Seems as though her people let expectations get away from them a bit .
“ The last couple weeks , they ’ve been trying to play down our number to spin you guys back to where they wanted you .
But it ’s pretty hard to spin this . ”
Not that McAuliffe is n’t prepared to give it the old college try .
It ’s the Friday after the numbers hit the streets , April 6 , and Clinton ’s chairman and I are sitting in Mantz ’s tenth - floor office in the campaign ’s K Street headquarters .
The couch is red , the carpet is blue , and McAuliffe ’s face is alabaster - white .
McAuliffe , 50 , is justifiably called the greatest fund - raiser in Democratic history ( though critics of the corrupting influence of corporate money in politics hardly consider that an honorific ) .
Also the most maniacal : Famously , he once wrestled a 260 - pound alligator to win a $ 15,000 donation to the Florida Democratic Party .
Today , McAuliffe reminds me that , as a kid growing up , he was a boxer .
“ We ’re now in a fight , ” he says .
“ This is great .
I ’m actually excited . ”
I start by asking about the campaign ’s efforts to foster around Hillary a sheen of invulnerability — efforts that now seem to have backfired .
( On top of Obama ’s haul , the Edwards campaign pulled in $ 14 million , double its take in the same period four years ago . )
I tell McAuliffe that I ’d spoken to a Clinton White House veteran , who observed , “ It ’s like they thought they were running the Mondale campaign ; they were just going to smother the other guy with money and endorsements . ”
“ Let ’s just stop right there , ” McAuliffe says , his voice quickly rising .
“ So we just finished up the biggest quarter in the history of American politics .
She ’s ahead in the polls .
We ’re taking nothing for granted … I ’ve said this from day one , I ’ve said this to Hillary : You ’ve got to earn it .
She knows it , her husband knows it , and it ’s gonna be a long , hard fight . ”
I mention that I ’d been in Chicago the previous day to visit Obama headquarters and that his people had been fairly gloating over a particular statistic : that the database of Clinton donors from her last Senate race contains 250,000 names , yet the campaign had received just 50,000 contributions this quarter — a pretty meager conversion rate .
“ First of all , that ’s direct mail , ” McAuliffe says .
“ We did only three mailings this quarter , and the response we got back from people is that it ’s too early .
It ’s just timing .
They ’ll all be there by the end of ’ 07 — those 250,000 donors will be back . ”
McAuliffe ’s confidence ( overconfidence ? ) strikes me as a less extreme version of some of the wild - eyed claims made by the campaign ’s bundlers two months earlier .
I ask Mantz , who ’s behind his desk , what he thought when he heard one of his fund - raisers say that Clinton would raise as much as the others put together .
“ I love that guy , ” Mantz deadpans .
“ Seriously , what I thought was , How you think this is helpful , I ’m not quite sure . ”
There ’ve been mild complaints by some Clinton bundlers that Hillary personally did n’t do enough events or make enough phone calls in the first quarter ; that she relied too heavily on her surrogates ; that , in short , she was complacent .
McAuliffe and Mantz allow that Clinton was n’t as active as Obama .
But they argue she was busy attending to her duties in the Senate , wangling endorsements — important work .
“ And yet she raised more money this quarter than any candidate in history ; I ’m almost embarrassed to be having this conversation with you ! ” McAuliffe says .
“ We were able to do what we wanted to based on the time she gave us .
And in the second quarter , she ’s probably got double the events coming up , a lot more small - donor ones across the country . ”
Even in New York , Patricof tells me later , Clinton still has plenty of upside potential .
“ New York ’s not tapped out for us at all .
There ’s a natural inclination at the beginning to go to your first tier .
Now there ’s going to be greater outreach to new constituencies , new communities , ethnic groups .
There are people on my list I still have n’t called yet .
And I plan to get on the phone with them very , very soon . ”
That Clinton will knock the cover off the ball in the second quarter is a lead - pipe certainty .
For all the ambivalence about her in some quarters , in others there ’s adulation — and Clinton is disciplined and relentless enough to track down every fan .
And McAuliffe and Mantz are right to say that her first - quarter showing was stellar .
Mismanaged expectations aside , the real story of the money primary so far is n’t that Hillary underperformed .
She did not .
The real story is about how Obama killed — and what it means for his candidacy and the race ahead .
David Axelrod has an answer at the ready , which is n’t surprising , since being on - message comes as naturally for him as breathing .
At 52 , Axelrod is among the best and most storied consultants in the business ; his résumé lists stints with four of the Democratic presidential candidates this year ( Obama , Clinton , Edwards , Chris Dodd ) as well as Chicago mayor Richard Daley and Illinois congressman Rahm Emanuel .
With a caterpillar mustache and a comb-over , he ’s unfashionable to a fault ; today , in his offices in Chicago , he ’s wearing a red shirt and green corduroys , looking altogether too Christmassy for the first week of April .
“ The most gratifying thing about our fund - raising success is n’t the bottom line , ” Axelrod says , “ but the number of people who have contributed and the number who are small contributors .
The people we ’re targeting are new to this ; they ’re not constrained by old loyalties .
There ’s a lot of energy in that world , and it gives us enormous potential to grow . ”
When I ask if he ’s implying a contrast to Clintonworld , Axelrod offers up a pointed aperçu : “ There ’s a difference between grabbing low - hanging fruit and planting trees . ”
Obama ’s finance people know that historically the second and third quarters have seen a falloff in contributions .
But whatever happens next on the money front , the political implications of Obama ’s first quarter are already set in stone .
The central question about Obama is whether , for all his charisma and star power , he may simply be a flash in the pan .
And that question remains largely unanswered .
He has yet to demonstrate anything approaching depth on any area of policy .
He has yet to articulate a compelling vision of America ’s place in the world at a time of clear and present peril .
For many people , even those inclined to favor him , he remains something of a cipher .
And he has yet to be tested under fire or to prove that he has the fortitude required to withstand the rigors of a presidential campaign — which Clinton has been and does in spades .
But Obama ’s performance in the money primary does demonstrate that he can build an organization , in a breathtakingly short time , that can go toe - to - toe with hers .
And that is no small thing .
“ As someone new to the presidential process , there was a question of , ‘ Can he hack it ? ’ ” says Axelrod .
“ That question has been answered . ”
The unanswered question in all of this , of course , is how much , in the end , the money primary actually matters .
The history here is singularly unhelpful .
In 1995 , GOP senator Phil Gramm declared , inspiringly , “ I have the most reliable friend you can have in American politics , and that ’s ready money . ”
Gramm set what was then a presidential fund - raising record — then failed to get past the Iowa caucus .
In 2003 , Edwards raised the most in the first quarter and Dean the most for the year — then both were trounced by Kerry .
On the other hand , Gore set a Democratic record for first - quarter fund - raising in 1999 and went on to win .
And Bush blew away his rivals that year , with the same result .
The reason why money is stipulated to matter more than ever this time — and the reason so much more is said to be required — is the accelerated primary schedule .
As things now stand , there will be four small - state contests in January : the Iowa and Nevada caucuses , the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries .
Then , on February 5 , as many as 24 states , including some of the biggest , will vote in one fell swoop .
“ We are moving headlong into a quasi-national primary , ” Axelrod explains .
“ You ’ve got to build a quasi-national organization from day one .
So your operations are more expensive .
And the only thing inflating in cost faster than media is health care . ”
There is , however , an alternative theory , espoused by the Edwards campaign , that the accelerated calendar actually makes money less important .
“ You have to hit a certain threshold , ” says Edwards deputy campaign manager Jonathan Prince .
“ You need enough money to saturate the first four states ” — maybe $ 40 million .
“ After that , it ’s all going to be about momentum .
If you do n’t have it , all the money in the world wo n’t be enough to help you .
It ’s not just that no campaign can possibly raise enough to saturate the airwaves on February 5 .
It ’s that , even if you could , it would n’t be nearly enough to counteract the screaming headlines in every local paper and the five - minute pieces every night at the top of the evening news that the candidate with momentum will get . ”
The Edwards argument is self - serving , to be sure , but far from implausible or lacking in precedent .
“ In 2000 , Gore had momentum , Bradley had more money — which people forget — and Gore won , ” says Nick Baldick , who ran Edwards ’s campaign in 2004 and is now focused exclusively on the four early states .
“ In 2004 , we had a favorable calendar , Dean had the money , but Kerry had momentum and that was everything . ”
Can Edwards be the candidate to seize the early momentum ?
Quite possibly .
While he ’s clearly the underdog among the big three , his campaign has not only been the most substantive of the lot ( see his proposal for universal health care ) but also the most strategic and focused .
Edwards is virtually living in Iowa , where his organization is deeply rooted .
He ’s tight with organized labor , which will be key in Nevada ( because of the large unionized labor force in Las Vegas ) .
And he stands a good chance in South Carolina , which he won in 2004 .
I ask Axelrod what he thinks of the Edwards theory about the limited power of money .
“ It ’s a theory , ” he replies .
“ My theory is , I do n’t know if they ’re right , but I ’d rather be prepared for either exigency . ”
Yet Axelrod does n’t disagree that the outcome of the early states will be pivotal .
“ If someone rolls up a bunch of states before February 5 , they ’ll go into that day with a huge amount of momentum .
And that ’s our goal .
To go into February 5 and deliver a knockout blow . ”
That someone will deliver a knockout blow that day is the assumption of all three campaigns .
But what if they are wrong ?
The possibility is tantalizing , and has led at least one Democratic savant to put forward a titillating scenario .
“ I may be the first idiot foolish enough to say it out loud , but we could be looking at something unheard of in the modern era—someone going into convention with only 30 percent , 40 percent of delegates , ” Dean ’s campaign guru , Joe Trippi , said recently .
“ Edwards , Hillary , and Obama may have enough cash before Iowa even happens to go all the way .
The polls are basically all dead heats …
What could happen is that we ’re headed for a brokered convention . ”
The brokered - convention scenario is the political equivalent of the fantasy of a Beatles reunion ( back when they were all still alive , that is ) :
“ The obsession of nostalgia buffs , ” as Axelrod puts it .
Or maybe not .
“ I think Trippi is right that it ’s more likely with this calendar , ” says Baldick .
“ I do n’t think it ’ll happen , but if there ’s split victories in the first four states and no one emerges with clear momentum , maybe . ”
How could it happen ?
Edwards , who by common consensus needs to win Iowa to survive , does n’t — Obama does .
Hillary wins Nevada and New Hampshire .
Obama wins South Carolina , where the black vote is potentially huge and Hillary is unloved .
Now it ’s a jump ball on February 5 — and Obama and Hillary split the big states between them .
Ah , the lure of fantasy .
Which is probably exactly what it is .
But more of a fantasy than Obama ’s beating Clinton in the money primary ?
We are in uncharted waters here .
Things could get very weird .
Four - dollar - a - gallon gasoline may be a cause for outrage .
But it pales next to the righteous fury provoked by five - dollar - a - pint beer .
Beer prices at bars and restaurants have risen over the past few months , as prices of hops and barley have skyrocketed and retail business has slowed alongside the economy .
Some restaurants have replaced 16 - ounce ...

MCARTHUR , Ohio —
A southern Ohio man has dodged what could have been another nine months in jail for sharing a Little Debbie snack cake with a fellow inmate .
The case involves 21 - year - old Timothy Caudill , who last year was held in a residential community corrections program in Nelsonville for breaking into a bar .
While there , prosecutors say he bought an oatmeal cream pie from a vending machine and shared it with a fellow inmate who was n’t allowed to eat the snack .
Prosecutors in Vinton County asked Common Pleas Judge Jeffrey Simmons to revoke Caudill ’s probation and put him in prison for nine months .
Instead , Simmons says Caudill will spend 30 days behind bars and pay $ 1,500 for the jail stay .

Scuffling in the Dark
Through myriad techniques and observations , cosmologists have recently arrived , after decades of strife , at a robust but dark consensus regarding a cosmos in which stars and galaxies , as well as the humans who gawk at them , amount to barely more than a disputatious froth .
It was born 13.7 billion years ago in the Big Bang .
By weight it is 4 percent atoms and 22 percent so - called dark matter of unknown identity  perhaps elementary particles that will be discovered at the Large Hadron Collider starting up outside Geneva this year .
That leaves 74 percent for the weight of whatever began causing the cosmos to accelerate about five billion years ago .
As far as astronomers can tell , there is no relation between dark matter , the particles , and dark energy other than the name , but you never know .
Some physicists are even willing to burn down their old sainted Einstein and revise his theory of gravity , general relativity , to make the cosmic discrepancies go away .
There is in fact a simple explanation for the dark energy , Dr. Witten pointed out , one whose tangled history goes all the way back to Einstein , but it is also the most troubling .
“ Dark energy has the somewhat unusual property that it was embarrassing before it was discovered , ” he said .
In 1917 , Einstein invented a fudge factor known as the cosmological constant , a sort of cosmic repulsion to balance gravity and keep the universe in balance .
He abandoned his constant when the universe was discovered to be expanding , but quantum physics resurrected it by showing that empty space should be foaming with energy that had the properties of Einstein ’s constant .
Alas , all attempts to calculate the amount of this energy come up with an unrealistically huge number , enough energy to blow away the contents of the cosmos like leaves in a storm before stars or galaxies could form .
Nothing could live there .
Dr. Witten and other physicists used to think this conundrum “ would somehow go away . ”
Something was missing in physicists ’ understanding of physics , the logic went .
The constant was really zero for deep reasons that , when revealed , would lead physicists closer to an understanding of what they call “ the vacuum , ” that is to say , the structure of reality .
“ It seems now that the answer is not really zero , ” Dr. Witten said .
Requiem for a Dream
Einstein ’s constant is the most economical explanation for dark energy , Dr. Witten said .
The others , involving new force fields or tinkering with Einstein ’s gravity , are hard to make work and raise more questions than they answer .
But if dark energy is the cosmological constant , it is smaller than predicted by a shocking factor of 1060 .
No fundamental principles can explain why Einstein ’s constant , or any physical parameter , could be so small without being zero , Dr. Witten said .
Zero can be a fundamental number , he said , but not a 1 with 59 zeroes between it and the decimal point .
The British soldiers at Hamburger Hill , a tiny base in the badlands of southern Helmand , sit on two frontlines of the Afghan war .
One is vigorously contested ; the other entirely abandoned .
The base - a 100 ft ( 30 metres ) high mound of sandy soil , machine guns and Scottish soldiers - is located across the river from a Taliban - controlled village .
The latest fighting erupted at lunchtime yesterday when the insurgents opened fire on a British helicopter .
It ended moments later when a bomb dropped from a Harrier jet slammed into their position , killing at least four insurgents , officers said .
But the other frontline is even closer to Hamburger Hill .
A sea of poppy fields surrounds the hilltop base , starting at the barbed - wire perimeter fence .
" As you can see , we are surrounded 360 degrees by poppy , " said Sergeant Brian Russell of 5 Scots A Company , standing behind a Javelin rocket launcher .
From his hilltop bunker , Sgt Russell enjoys an intimate view of the Afghan poppy trade .
He pointed to a group of turbaned men in a nearby field , hunched over pink - flowered poppy plants .
Armed with sharp blades , they were gently extracting an oily black substance from the opium - laden bulbs .
" They start after dawn and do n't finish till last light , " he said .
Thousands of seasonal workers have come from Lashkar Gah , the provincial capital 33 miles to the north .
They come for the daily wage of £ 10 - a princely sum in these parts .
The opium gum they coax from the poppy bulbs is collected in glass jars , then handed to a man on a motorcycle .
The soldiers sometimes speak to the poppy workers .
" Yesterday we gave some sweets to the kids .
Through the interpreter the adults said : ' We are pleased you are here , thanks for your help ' , " said Sgt Russell .
Sometimes they even help them .
When one poppy worker arrived at the camp gate suffering from heat exhaustion recently , he was referred to the main base in Garmser town , less than a mile away .
He was treated by a military doctor .
" We 're not much interested in what they are doing with the poppy , " said Sgt Russell .
" We know it 's going on but we 're soldiers , not politicians .
And we 're here to do a good job . "
The difficult job of fighting Afghanistan 's drug war continues .
After last year 's record harvest , another good year for the drug lords is predicted .
Western officials forecast only a small fall on last year 's harvest of 193,000 hectares ( 480,000 acres ) , which supplied 93 % of the world 's opiates .
" Last year saw a decrease in cultivation in the north and an increase in the south .
This year that trend will be strengthened , " said Christina Oguz of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime in Kabul .
There is some good news .
A bitterly cold winter will lower crop yields significantly .
The number of drug - free provinces , which rose from six to 13 in 2007 , is expected to rise again , some say to as many as 21 of Afghanistan 's 28 provinces .
The most dramatic triumph occurred in south - eastern Nangarhar , last year 's No 2 poppy - growing province .
This year the Nangarhar crop has collapsed to virtually nothing thanks to a muscular campaign led by the strongman governor , Gul Agha Sherzai .
The coup is connected to national politics - Sherzai has ambitions of contesting next year 's presidential elections .
But in Helmand , where thousands of British soldiers are fighting the Taliban , little has changed .
Last year , the vast southern province accounted for about half the total crop ; this year will probably yield a similar proportion .
The opium glut is creating addicts locally as well as abroad .
A five - year - old boy was recently admitted to a clinic in Laskhar Gah , one British official said .
The police force is also riddled with addicts .
US - funded efforts to destroy the crops with tractors and sticks have produced meagre results .
This year 's campaign left several eradication workers dead , dozens more injured and destroyed just 4,000 hectares of poppy - a sliver of the total .
But officials are pleased that some major drug cultivators were hit .
About a fifth of the crop of Abdul Rahman Jan - until two years ago the provincial police chief - was destroyed .
Garmser is a major hub of the Helmand trade .
From here smugglers head across the " desert of death " , as it is locally known , to the Pakistani border 120 miles away .
But Garmser is also a major centre of cultivation , fed , ironically , by American - funded irrigation canals built in the 1960s .
From their base in the deserted town , British officers know this only too well .
A surveillance camera hanging from a white balloon floating over the camp offers a bird 's eye view of the local drug lord 's house and his flourishing crops .
As elsewhere , the trade is closely linked to the insurgency .
Fighting has lulled recently as the Taliban allows the harvest to take place .
Recently the insurgents called a shura ( " consultation " ) in Amir Agha , five miles to the south , and ordered villagers to grow poppies .
" The Taliban are getting money from the drug dealers and distributing it among their soldiers , " said a local intelligence chief .
But for the British , interference with the poppy crop is out of the question .
" We have to be pragmatic , " said Major Neil Den-McKay , officer commanding of 5 Scots A Company .
" Right now we cannot set the conditions where counter - narcotics operations would be beneficial to British forces in Garmser .
And let 's face it , if we cannot provide an alternative livelihood to people , we must just accept it . "
The British officer said he was " sometimes sympathetic " to the predicament of poor Afghan farmers .
Britain has a responsibility to tackle the problem at home , he said .
" Before we start banging a drum about what is right and wrong , we should reduce the demand in the UK . "
As dusk drew over Hamburger Hill on Sunday , workers streamed out of the fields and back towards their lodgings .
A British convoy heading back to Garmser base passed them in a £ 1 m
Mastiff vehicle , equipped with the latest battle armour and surveillance cameras .
From the top of the Mastiff , the British could see into the labour compounds , where people were setting fires and laying out rugs for an evening meal .
In the dusty street outside , some children waved at the passing soldiers .
The work - weary adults were less impressed .
Some flung a handful of pebbles at the passing vehicle .
But most just ignored the foreign soldiers , and turned into the houses for their evening meal .
MIAMI BEACH , Fla. , May 24 ( UPI ) --
A former employee of Florida 's Mount Sinai Medical Center faces criminal charges after admitting to performing oral sex on a patient , police said .
Hialeah , Fla. , resident Pedro J. Gonzalez , 27 , was charged with sexual battery , Miami Beach police said .

The hospital fired Gonzalez after the April 30 incident , The Miami Herald reported Thursday .
Gonzalez 's hospital duties included wheeling patients through the building .
'' Even an isolated incident is unacceptable .
We worked very closely with the Miami Beach police on this matter , and will continue to assist the authorities until a proper resolution is achieved , '' said hospital spokeswoman Pamela Gadinsky .
The 31 - year - old surgery patient said he was waking up from anesthesia when he shoved Gonzalez away after he " began to perform oral sex ' ' on him .
Because Mr. Burkle ’s Yucaipa funds are private , and the Clintons have refused to release their tax returns , details of Yucaipa ’s investments and Mr. Clinton ’s potential to profit from them are not publicly available .
Last year , after Mr. Clinton published a book on philanthropy that extols the virtues of investing in renewable energy and contains a reference to Cilion , a spokesman for the former president told New York magazine that he consulted for Yucaipa on renewable energy investments but was not involved in Cilion .
On Wednesday , a spokesman for Yucaipa declined to say how much it had invested in Cilion , but said it amounted to less than 5 percent of the company ’s equity  small by Yucaipa standards , but enough for it to be represented on Cilion ’s board .
He said Mr. Clinton did not stand to profit from Yucaipa ’s investment in Cilion .
Under an agreement with Mr. Burkle in 2002 , Mr. Clinton was to provide advice and find investment opportunities for several domestic and foreign funds in Yucaipa ’s portfolio , and would receive a share of the profits from those funds .
On a financial disclosure report that Mrs. Clinton filed as a presidential candidate last year , Mr. Clinton listed several direct investments through Yucaipa , including one in a Brazilian sugar - cane ethanol company founded by Mr. Khosla , but Cilion was not among them .
Mrs. Clinton is far from alone in proposing increased federal incentives for renewable energy  her opponent , Senator Barack Obama of Illinois , backs even greater spending on biofuels  and not all of her actions on ethanol would benefit the interests of Mr. Clinton and his associates .
She has voted to preserve a tariff on Brazilian ethanol imports , which helps domestic ethanol producers but works against investors in Brazilian facilities .
In fact , Mrs. Clinton had long opposed ethanol subsidies , but in May 2006 , she switched gears and introduced a bill to create a $ 50 billion “ strategic energy fund ” to expand the use of ethanol and other alternative fuels .
The bill , which was reintroduced last year , would direct billions of dollars to develop cellulosic ethanol , an experimental fuel made from organic materials other than corn .

In addition to the legislation , Mrs. Clinton has spent an increasing amount of time in upstate New York , promoting the region as fertile territory for renewable energy projects .
In Lockport in July 2006 , she said she was working with the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry  which has offered technical assistance to Cilion and other companies in the region  to support locally produced ethanol , rather than “ just relying on corn in the Midwest . ”
India and Africa have historic ties India PM Manmohan Singh says the country will invest heavily in development projects in Africa to bolster economies ties .
He was speaking in the Indian capital , Delhi , at the first summit aimed at strengthening trade and diplomatic ties between India and Africa .
India would provide more than $ 500 m for projects in Africa , Mr Singh said .
Correspondents say India is increasingly interested in Africa , as it looks for new sources of energy .
India is also said to be trying to counter the influence of China , which is building ties with African countries that are traditionally close to India .
Mr Singh also said India would give easier access for exports from the world 's poorest countries , many of which are in Africa .
' Historic ties ' " No one understands better than India and Africa the imperative need for global institutions to reflect current realities and to build a more equitable global economy and polity , " Mr Singh said .
The two - day summit is being attended by 14 African leaders .
They include Thabo Mbeki of South Africa , Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and Ethiopia 's Meles Zenawi .
President Mbeki told the summit that India and Africa had many challenges in common .
" Our enemy is common .
We both have poverty and underdevelopment , " he said .
The BBC's Sanjoy Majumder in Delhi says India will pitch to gain access to Africa 's natural resources - particularly energy - in return for increased aid and low - cost solutions to battle poverty .
India has traded with Africa for centuries .
It has strongly supported independence movements in several African nations and Mahatma Gandhi 's famous civil disobedience movement against British colonial rule began in South Africa .
Now it wants to cash in on the goodwill .
Although trade between India and Africa has increased to $ 30bn a year , it is still almost half that of China's .
Recently , Delhi has lost a number of lucrative oil exploration contracts in Africa to Beijing .
The BBC 's world affairs correspondent Nick Childs says in holding the summit India appears to be following China - two years ago , Beijing hosted a ground - breaking Africa summit , a signal of its growing interest in the continent .
India 's energy needs are rising fast
So over the next couple of days India is expected to announce a massive aid package as well as a number of projects in areas such as information and technology , agriculture and education .
Many here believe that India holds an edge because of its expertise in providing low - cost technology - it is already a major supplier of cheap generic drugs .
In return it wants oil and gas , minerals and diamonds and also a market for its own manufactured goods .
A new report by the London - based think - tank Chatham House says that India is worried about China 's encroachment on the African rim of the Indian ocean , which Delhi has long seen as its strategic backyard .
So the Indians , according to the report , are responding with deepening security as well as commercial ties with countries like the Seychelles , Mauritius , and Mozambique .

What are these ?
Below I noted MSNBC ’s story tonight about how fmr .
Sen. Phil Gramm ( McCain ’s economics advisor ) was advising him on his subprime mortgage bailout policy while Gramm was also a registered lobbyist for the Swiss bank UBS .
Now , it ’s clear from the report that UBS had some exposure on the subprime front .
But I was n’t aware of the true extent of it .
TPM Reader KB sends in articles Businessweek and Forbes that show just how big a player UBS was .
Forbes says that UBS is among the banks worst hit by the global credit crisis , particularly in their direct exposure to the US subprime market .
According to Forbes , UBS has some $ 37 billion in write - downs on assets tied to bad US mortgages .
In other words , the bank ’s very life appears to be on the line in how the US government chooses to handle the matter .
As MSNBC reported , UBS deregistered Gramm as a lobbyist for the company on April 18th , though he continues to serve as a vice chairman of the bank .
But that was fully a month after McCain ’s speech outlining his own approach to the crisis .
Many of the lobbying connections the press has dug up on McCain have been embarassing .
But I ’m not sure any have really had teeth until this one .
After all , how much does the average voter care that Charlie Black represented a lot of foreign dictators ?
A stench , yes ?
But finding out that McCain had a major subprime lender bank lobbyist whispering in his ear when McCain told the public that it was basically tough luck if they lost their houses ?
( ed.note : Let me clarify one point .
UBS was not a bank lending people money for home loans .
Their very high level of exposure came from buying paper instruments backed by iffy mortgages .
The way this works is that lender company X lends a bunch of people money to buy homes .
Then company X packages all that together and sells it to a company like UBS — which bought quite a lot .
There are many more levels of complexity , as I ’m sure our banking industry readers will point out .
But this is the basic point — they are heavily exposed to the fallout from the subprime crisis without having been a first order lender themselves . )
j Query style chaining with the Django ORM
Django ’s ORM is , in my opinion , the unsung gem of the framework .
For the subset of SQL that ’s used in most web applications it ’s very hard to beat .
It ’s a beautiful piece of API design , and I tip my hat to the people who designed and built it .
Lazy evaluation
If you have n’t spent much time with the ORM , two key features are lazy evaluation and chaining .
Consider the following statement :
entries = Entry.objects.all ( )
Assuming you have created an Entry model of some sort , the above statement will create a Django QuerySet object representing all of the entries in the database .
It will not result in the execution of any SQL — QuerySets are lazily evaluated , and are only executed at the last possible moment .
The most common situation in which SQL will be executed is when the object is used for iteration :
for entry in entries : print entry .
title
This usually happens in a template :
< ul > { % for entry in entries %} < li >{ { entry.
title }}</li > { % endfor %} </ul >
Lazy evaluation works nicely with template fragment caching — even if you pass a QuerySet to a template it wo n’t be executed if the fragment it is used in can be served from the cache .
You can modify QuerySets as many times as you like before they are executed :
entries = Entry.objects.all ( ) today = datetime.date.today ( ) entries_this_year = entries.filter ( posted__year = today .
year ) entries_last_year = entries.filter ( posted__year = today .
year - 1 )
Again , no SQL has been executed , but we now have two QuerySets which , when iterated , will produce the desired result .
Chaining
Chaining comes in when you want to apply multiple modifications to a QuerySet .
Here are blog entries from 2006 that were n’t posted in January :
Entry.objects.filter ( posted__year = 2006 ) .exclude( posted__month = 1 )
And here ’s entries from that year posted to the category named “ Personal ” , ordered by title :
Entry.objects.filter ( posted__year = 2006 ) . filter ( category__name = " Personal " ) .order_by ( ' title ' )
The above can also be expressed like this :
Entry.objects.filter ( posted__year = 2006 , category__name = " Personal " ) .order_by ( ' title ' )
Chaining in jQuery
The parallels to jQuery are pretty clear .
The jQuery API is built around chaining , and the jQuery animation library even uses a form of lazy evaluation to automatically queue up effects to run in sequence :
jQuery ( ' div#message ').addClass ( ' borderfade ' ) .animate ( { ' borderWidth ' : '+ 10 px ' } , 1000 ) .fadeOut ( ) ;
One of the neatest things about jQuery is the plugin model , which takes advantage of JavaScript ’s prototype inheritance and makes it trivially easy to add new chainable methods .
If we wanted to package the above dumb effect up as a plugin , we could do so like this :
jQuery.fn.dumbBorderFade = function ( ) { return this .addClass ( ' borderfade ' ) .animate ( { ' borderWidth ' : '+ 10 px ' } , 1000 ) .fadeOut ( ) ; } ;
Now we can apply it to an element like so :
jQuery ( ' div#message ').dumbBorderFade ( ) ;
Custom QuerySet methods in Django
Django supports adding custom methods for accessing the ORM through the ability to implement a custom Manager .
In the above examples , Entry.objects is the Manager .
The downside of this approach is that methods added to a manager can only be used at the beginning of the chain .
Luckily , Managers also provide a hook for returning a custom QuerySet .
This means we can create our own QuerySet subclass and add new methods to it , in a way that ’s reminiscent of jQuery :
from django.db import models from django.db.models.query import QuerySet import datetime class EntryQuerySet ( QuerySet ) : def on_date ( self , date ) : next = date + datetime.timedelta( days = 1 ) return self .
filter ( posted__gt = date , posted__lt = next ) class EntryManager ( models .
Manager ) : def get_query_set ( self ) : return EntryQuerySet(self.model ) class Entry ( models .
Model ) : ... objects = EntryManager ( )
The above gives us a new method on the QuerySets returned by Entry.objects called on_date ( ) , which lets us filter entries down to those posted on a specific date .
Now we can run queries like the following :
Entry.objects.filter ( category__name = ' Personal ' ).on_date( datetime.date ( 2008 , 5 , 1 ) )
Reducing the boilerplate
This method works fine , but it requires quite a bit of boilerplate code — a QuerySet subclass and a Manager subclass plus the wiring to pull them all together .
Would n’t it be neat if you could declare the extra QuerySet methods inside the model definition itself ?
It turns out you can , and it ’s surprisingly easy .
Here ’s the syntax I came up with :
from django.db.models.query import QuerySet class Entry ( models .
Model ) : ... objects = QuerySetManager ( ) ... class QuerySet ( QuerySet ) : def on_date ( self , date ) : return self.
filter ( ... )
Here I ’ve made the custom QuerySet class an inner class of the model definition .
I ’ve also replaced the default manager with a QuerySetManager .
All this class does is return the QuerySet inner class for the current model from get_query_set .
The implementation looks like this :
class QuerySetManager( models .
Manager ) : def get_query_set ( self ) : return self.model.QuerySet(self.model )
I ’m pretty happy with this ; it makes it trivial to add custom QuerySet methods and does so without any monkeypatching or deep reliance on Django ORM internals .
I think the ease with which this can be achieved is a testament to the quality of the ORM API .
But to some reporters , those attempts at making nice have come late .
“ Part of it is her campaign ’s fault , ” Andrea Mitchell , the longtime NBC political correspondent , said backstage at the MSNBC debate in Cleveland in Tuesday .
“ They started with this notion of inevitability .
And they were very arrogant . ”

It would be difficult to analyze systematically whether the mountain of articles , blog postings and video segments tilts toward one candidate or the other .
But the Project for Excellence in Journalism , a research institute that compiles a weekly index of campaign coverage by 48 news outlets , said that by one measure Mr. Obama had outpaced Mrs. Clinton beginning in mid-February  prominent mentions in that coverage .
Some Clinton aides and even reporters pointed this week to articles that could , at least anecdotally and in isolation , be construed as favorable to Mr. Obama .
Among those cited were a front - page article in The Times last June that focused on Mr. Obama ’s pickup basketball prowess , and another Tuesday on the front of The Washington Post that extolled his oratorical virtues .
Others marshaled clippings indicating that Mr. Obama had been subject to more serious scrutiny than the Clintons would acknowledge .
These include articles from Ms. Sweet of The Sun -Times examining Mr. Obama ’s flights on corporate jets early in his Senate career and the literary license he took on his first memoir .
They also noted articles in the Chicago papers ( as well as in The Times , and others ) about Mr. Obama ’s relationship with Antoin Rezko , a former fund - raiser soon to be tried on federal charges of fraud and influence peddling .
Which is not to say that there is not much more scouring to be done .
“ The number of questions that we do n’t know the answers to about the relationship between Mr. Rezko and Mr. Obama is staggering , ” Howard Wolfson , a top aide to Mrs. Clinton , said on a conference call with reporters on Friday .
Still , others have noted that with the exception of a mention by Mr. Russert in Tuesday ’s debate , Mrs. Clinton has largely escaped serious journalistic vetting over matters like when or whether her campaign will release her tax returns or her calendar from her years as first lady , or detail the origins of the $ 5 million she has contributed to her own campaign .
Jonathan Alter , the veteran Newsweek columnist who traveled with the Obama campaign to Dallas on Wednesday , said that the attempt by the Clinton camp to weigh various stories represented a kind of “ silly , even - Steven - itis . ”

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- A retired U.S. Army colonel pleaded guilty Tuesday to awarding contracts in Iraq to a Kuwait - based firm in exchange for gifts .
Levonda Selph of Virginia admitted accepting $ 4,000 in cash and a $ 5,000 vacation to Thailand from the unidentified contractor , which was awarded $ 12 million in contracts to operate Defense Department warehouses in Iraq .
She pleaded guilty to charges of bribery and conspiracy .
She was secretly indicted on those charges in October ; the charges were n't disclosed until her court appearance Tuesday .
Under terms of a plea agreement , Selph could receive up to 33 months in jail .
She promised to repay the government $ 9,000 and to cooperate in an ongoing investigation .
Prosecutors said Selph was a lieutenant colonel at Camp Victory in Iraq in 2004 and 2005 when she led a committee that awarded the warehouse contracts .
The Justice Department said she will be free until her sentencing October 14 but will not be allowed to leave the country .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Supporters of Barack Obama backed away on Sunday from calls for Hillary Clinton to drop out of the presidential race as Democrats faced a long summer of bitter fighting to win the party ’s White House nomination .

In an interview published in The Washington Post , Clinton said she would fight all the way to the late August nominating convention , where a candidate will be chosen to face presumptive Republican nominee John McCain in the November election .
“ I think the race should continue , ” said New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson , a former Democratic presidential candidate who supports Obama .
“ She has every right to stay in the race .
She ’s run a very good campaign . ”
Some Obama backers have called on New York Sen.
Clinton to give up , citing the Illinois senator ’s leads in the popular vote , states won and delegates to the convention to choose the nominee .
But Clinton has used those calls to rally her supporters , saying Washington insiders are trying to force her out before all Democrats have voted .
She also stressed the need for new votes in Florida and Michigan , whose earlier primary votes were rejected because they violated party rules .
“ I have no intention of stopping until we finish what we started and until we see what happens in the next 10 contests and until we resolve Florida and Michigan , ” Clinton said in the Post interview .
“ And if we do n’t resolve it , we ’ll resolve it at the convention . ”
CAMPUS RALLY
With the next big contest coming in Pennsylvania on April 22 , Clinton and McCain took much of the day off , but Obama campaigned at Pennsylvania State University .
Some 22,000 people came to listen to him speak at an open air rally , which aides said was one of the biggest events of the Democratic campaign .
“ I believe that the Democrats will be unified as soon as this nomination is settled .
We will be unified because we understand that we do not want to be clinging to the policies of the past .
We are the party of the future , ” Obama said .
College students have been some of Obama ’s most active supporters and in Pennsylvania he must score big among them if he is to do well against Clinton .
“ You will have a president who has taught the constitution and believes in the constitution and will obey the constitution of the United States of America , ” Obama told the crowd , making a comparison between himself and President George W. Bush .
Obama supporters hit the Sunday morning television talk shows to play down talk that Clinton should quit -- at least before the final nomination contests on June 3 .
But after that , with neither Democratic contender likely to have captured the 2,024 delegates needed to face McCain , they wanted a quick resolution so the fight does not last all summer .
The outcome will probably lie with several hundred “ superdelegates ” -- party leaders and elected officials free to vote for either candidate .
Slideshow ( 4 images )
“ After June 3 , it ’s important that Democrats come together and not be so divided as we have been , ” Richardson said on CBS ’ “ Face the Nation . ” “ But I think it ’s important that , at the end of the June 3 date , we look at who has the most delegates , who has the most popular vote , who has the most states . ”
That would most likely favor Obama .
But Clinton backers did not see the need to hurry .
“ Neither Sen. Clinton nor Sen .
Obama , based on what people say the math is , can get the required number of delegates .
And so you have to play it out until the end , ” Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter , a Clinton backer , said on the CBS show .
Tennessee ’s Democratic Gov. Phil Bredesen has proposed the superdelegates get together to make their choices after June 3 so the party can heal its wounds and go after the Republicans .
“ You have to bring it to a closure sometime long before the end of August so that you can start that healing process and , you know , whoever wins can say their mea culpas about what they said , and bring the party back together , ” he said on “ Fox News Sunday . ”
Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry , an Obama supporter who was the party ’s losing presidential nominee in 2004 , said the superdelegates needed to make up their minds early so Democrats can organize to beat McCain .
“ As a former nominee , I will tell you , this time right now is critical to us , ” he said on ABC ’s “ This Week .
“ I think every day does give John McCain an ability to organize nationally . ”

June 5 , 2008
LAST MONTH , Ted Kennedy was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor .
All the major news outlets provided daily updates on Kennedy 's medical treatment and prognosis .
The media failed to point out an important fact : Unlike average Americans , the senator from Massachusetts did n't have to worry for one minute that he would n't get the care he needed for his life - threatening cancer .
The president , vice president and members of Congress all enjoy government - financed health care , with few restrictions or prohibitive out - of - pocket co-pays .
They are never turned away for pre-existing conditions or denied care for what insurance companies label " experimental treatments " ( like the brain surgery Kennedy just underwent ) .
No , from the moment he had a seizure at his home on Cape Cod and was flown to Boston ( an ambulance would have taken too long ) , until his surgery early this week , he got what the California Nurses Association ( CNA ) has dubbed " CheneyCare " -- named in honor of the vice president with a chronic heart condition , for whom no health care expense is too great .
After suffering a seizure , Ted Kennedy was flown by helicopter to a Boston hospital
Kennedy and his family did n't have to spend hours on the phone fighting to get pre-authorization to see a neurosurgeon , and he did n't wait months for an appointment .
Within a week , he had a meeting with a group of top - flight neurosurgeons from the country 's leading medical institutions to discuss all his options and select a surgeon .
Kennedy did n't have to argue with his insurer to get all those second opinions .
And he was n't told by an insurance company bureaucrat that the surgery was n't " medically necessary " on the basis that the prognosis for a man his age with a malignant glioma in the parietal lobe is bleak at best .
Kennedy elected to have surgery at the Brain Tumor Center at Duke University Medical Center in North Carolina .
He lives in Massachusetts , of course , but it was n't a problem that the surgery took place in another state -- apparently the doctors and hospital are n't " out of network . "
He wo n't be sent a bill for the surgery and hospitalization .
And , of course , Kennedy will never have to declare bankruptcy due to medical debt .
THE SENATOR from Massachusetts has staked his legislative career on reforming the health care system .
By any measure , he and all the other politicians in Washington have failed abysmally .
Two statistics speak volumes about the scale of the health care crisis in the U.S. today : 50 million people in the United States have no health insurance , and at least 18,000 die every year due to lack of access to health care .
In 1971 , Kennedy was actually in favor of a national , single - payer health care system .
In opposition to President Richard Nixon 's support for a mandate requiring employers to purchase private insurance for employees , Kennedy , along with Rep. Martha Griffiths ( D - Mich . ) , proposed the Health Security Act .
The legislation aimed to eliminate the role of commercial insurers and provide everyone with comprehensive medical benefits , financing the program out of a payroll tax and the government 's general revenues .
Kennedy railed against Nixon 's mandates , saying this would provide the insurance industry with " a windfall of billions of dollars annually . "
How ironic then that Kennedy 's home state of Massachusetts was the first to pass a mandate model for extending health care coverage -- with Kennedy a chief supporter of then Gov. Mitt Romney 's program .
The mandates are a failure .
There are still over 600,000 uninsured in Massachusetts .
All Massachusetts residents are required to have insurance , and for many not covered by their employer or under programs for the poor , that means buying policies .
The lowest - cost plan offered to a couple in their 50s is $ 8,200 annually , with a $ 2,000 per person deductible .
The insurance industry loves the Massachusetts mandate .
In the words that Kennedy uttered decades ago , it 's " a windfall of billions of dollars annually . "
Back in the 1970s , Kennedy abandoned the Health Security Act , saying it was n't " politically feasible . "
In reality , he was n't willing to take on the medical - industrial complex .
Kennedy became known as the master of the " across - the - aisle compromise . "
But these compromises , while maintaining the power and profits of the private insurance industry , did n't lower the cost of health care or increase the percentage of people with insurance .
In 1974 , he proposed the Mills - Kennedy Bill , a capitulation to the private insurance industry that preserved their role and the link between employment and health insurance .
The Committee for National Health Insurance , founded by the United Auto Workers union , broke with Kennedy over this betrayal , charging him with " selling out on the health issue . "
In 1978 , Kennedy sold out again by advocating an employer mandate that continued to allow commercial insurers a central role , but with greater federal regulation .
Kennedy is chairman of the Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pensions committee .
Not surprisingly , he is one of the top recipients of health - care industry political contributions .
During his 40 years in Congress , he has accepted millions from insurance and pharmaceutical political action committees , according to OpenSecrets.org .
Perhaps this explains why he has refused to co-sponsor Rep. John Conyers HR 676 , legislation that would create a single - payer , government - financed health care system .
For politicians like Kennedy , there will never be a time when single - payer , government - financed health care is politically feasible , viable or attainable .
Instead , they will echo the words of Barack Obama - - another former supporter of single payer and current recipient of big bucks from the health sector .
Obama argues that if he was starting from scratch , he would be in favor of single - payer , but now , we have to build on the broken system we have .
A government - financed health care system for everyone just wo n't work -- except for them .
John McCain slithered down to the lower 9th Ward in New Orleans last week just to walk a few blocks and tell the American public how appalled he is by the Bush administration 's response to Hurricane Katrina .
To the area hardest hit by Katrina , he vowed , " never again will a disaster of this nature be handled in the terrible and disgraceful way it was handled . "
This is classic political posturing to help McCain look like somebody who might actually have an ounce of empathy for the downtrodden .
John McCain was an active member of the Senate throughout the entire Katrina ordeal .
To suggest that he was surprised about the Bush administration 's botched response to Hurricane Katrina is hypocrisy at its best .
In fact , he helped to shape that response by voting down several measures that would have helped the Katrina victims .
McCain voted against the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill of 2006 , which would have provided , among other funding , $ 28 billion for hurricane relief .
He also voted against a measure to provide emergency health care and other types of much - needed relief to Katrina survivors , such as access to Medicaid , $ 800 million in compensation to those providing care to Katrina evacuees , and access to the TANF ( Temporary Aid to Needy Families ) Contingency Fund for the states affected by Katrina and those taking in Katrina evacuees .
If John McCain truly cares about ensuring a more appropriate response to the next natural disaster , then why did he vote – not once but twice – against establishing a commission to provide a " post mortem " review of the response to Katrina ?
The final insult came in 2005 when McCain voted against extending up to 52 weeks of unemployment benefits to those affected by Hurricane Katrina .
These are not the votes of a compassionate conservative .
The ultimate indignity for the people of New Orleans is John McCain using their city as a political prop , painting himself as the ' kinder , gentler ' GOP candidate and vowing that such a disgraceful response will not happen if he 's elected .
That 's great John , but the people of New Orleans are probably wondering just exactly what you 're going to do to help them out of the mess they are in right now .
When asked about rebuilding the lower 9th Ward , he fumbled around for an answer that ended up being clear in the end :
He did n't know if he would rebuild it or tear it down if he is elected president .
I 'm sure it 's a comfort to those who live there that McCain can authorize a $ 12 billion - a - month war but he cannot commit to providing affordable housing in an area devastated by natural disaster .
There 's something wrong about that .
The unkindest ' cuts ' of all
McCain's PR handlers and the mainstream media can spin him any way they want , but his actions are at direct odds with what they want us to believe .
In 2001 , after being defeated by Bush , he voted against the administration 's tax cuts .
From the Senate floor he stated that he could not " in good conscience support a tax cut in which so many of the benefits go to the most fortunate among us , at the expense of the middle class Americans who most need tax relief . "
That was six years ago when he had lost his bid for the presidency and was , by several accounts , disgusted with the way the Bush campaign was waged .
It 's 2008 and John McCain is fighting for his political life .
Do not ever misjudge his drive to become president .
Bush 's tax cuts will expire in 2010 and now Mr. McCain is in favor of making the majority of those cuts permanent ( the one exception being the inheritance tax ) .
Nothing has changed about them .
The cuts are still weighted to the wealthiest people in America .
What has changed is McCain 's situation and whom he must assuage to reach what he no doubt feels is his destiny .
It gets even more ugly when McCain is left to think for himself .
He also has his own plan to eliminate the alternative minimum tax ( originally created to prevent the wealthy from exploiting tax loopholes ) and reduce the tax rate on corporate profits .
The middle class may not be the only victim of McCain 's tax plan .
Some experts are concerned about the nation 's solvency should this plan go into effect .
One other connection here that is rarely made by the mainstream media is the fact that John McCain 's net worth is in the $ 40 million dollar range .
His wife is the chairwoman of the third - largest Anheuser - Busch beer distributorship in the nation .
They also have impressive real estate holdings .
It is said that McCain and his wife own eight homes .
Seems that the McCain family is in a perfect position to reap the benefits of those tax breaks .
The media attention McCain receives for his position of wealth is minimal compared to the scrutiny given to John Kerry and John Edwards .
McCain 's supporters , of course , point out that it 's really not his wealth .
It 's his wife 's .
So was John Kerry's , but that did n't stop the media from having a field day with it .
Throwing the public a bone
McCain 's extraordinary compassion has inspired him to suggest rescinding the 18 - cent gas tax through the summer .
It saves the public about sixty cents a day ( or $ 4.20 per week ; just about where gas will be per gallon this summer ) .
McCain went on to place his foot in his mouth by acknowledging it's not much money , but it will provide the American people with a " little psychological boost . "
This is absolutely useless to the people suffering sticker shock at the food stores and getting gouged for profits at the gas pumps .
By the way , the money for this idea would be taken from funds used to build and maintain our roads and bridges .
This money actually does create jobs and stimulate the economy .

Banned From Playing Basketball With the Boys Teammates ' parents did n't complain until 6 - foot girl blocked boys ' shots .
May 24 , 2008 --
An Oregon basketball player is being kicked out of her basketball league -- all because she 's a girl .
Jaime Nared may be only 12 years old , but she 's called a basketball powerhouse by teammates and already stands over 6 feet tall .
Jaime is such a good basketball player her coach and parents decided she should play in the boys ' league .
" I think I do a little bit better when I play with the boys , " said Jaime , " because I push myself even harder playing with them . "
Her coach said the other players ' parents were fine when Jaime joining the team until she outshone their sons on the court .
" They were great ... until she blocked the first shot .
Then they were like , ' Hey , we do n't want this big kid coming out and making us look bad , ' " said Michael Abraham , Jaime 's coach .
After parents complained , The Hoop , a private league that organizes the games , told Jaime she could no longer play with the boys , citing a rule that bars mixed - gender teams .
That decision has frustrated many .
" Why would you have an issue with a kid wanting to be a kid ? " said Jaime 's dad , Greg Nared .
Having a girl on their team has n't been an issue , said Jaime 's teammates .
" Her greatness ... sprinkles off and goes onto us , " said fellow teammate Joey Alfieri . " [ It ] makes us better as a player too . "
Her teammates even wrote letters to The Hoop saying they did n't think the decision was fair , according to Jaime .
Jaime has played with the team for more than a year but now she can only practice with her teammates .
During games , she has to play with an all - girls team .
" I do n't understand why they would n't want me to play with them , just because I am a girl , " she said .
Sports play a big role for the entire Nared family .
Her father managed golfer Michel Wie and used to work for Tiger Woods .
And Jaime 's sister is on a basketball scholarship at the University of Maryland .
And though she is n't even in high school , Jaime already has been offered a scholarship to Oregon State , according to her coach , Michael Abraham .
Still , despite all the support for Jaime , The Hoop wo n't reverse their decision .
In a statement to ABC News , The Hoop said : " It stands by its decision to not change the rules of their spring league while in process . "
But being banned from playing with the boys wo n't squash Jaime 's dream of playing with the pros some day .
Jaime said she wants to be the first female player in the NBA .
The odd behavior of a molecule in an experimental silicon computer chip has led to a discovery that opens the door to quantum computing in semiconductors .
In a Nature Physics journal paper currently online , the researchers describe how they have created a new , hybrid molecule in which its quantum state can be intentionally manipulated - a required step in the building of quantum computers .
" Up to now large - scale quantum computing has been a dream , " says Gerhard Klimeck , professor of electrical and computer engineering at Purdue University and associate director for technology for the national Network for Computational Nanotechnology .
" This development may not bring us a quantum computer 10 years faster , but our dreams about these machines are now more realistic . "
The workings of traditional computers have n't changed since they were room - sized behemoths 50 years ago ; they still use bits of information , 1s and 0s , to store and process information .
Quantum computers would harness the strange behaviors found in quantum physics to create computers that would carry information using quantum bits , or qubits .
Computers would be able to process exponentially more information .
If a traditional computer were given the task of looking up a person 's phone number in a telephone book , it would look at each name in order until it found the right number .
Computers can do this much faster than people , but it is still a sequential task .
A quantum computer , however , could look at all of the names in the telephone book simultaneously .

Quantum computers also could take advantage of the bizarre behaviors of quantum mechanics - some of which are counterintuitive even to physicists - in ways that are hard to fathom .
For example , two quantum computers could , in concept , communicate instantaneously across any distance imaginable , even across solar systems .
Albert Einstein , in a letter to Erwin Schrödinger in the 1930s , wrote that in a quantum state a keg of gunpowder would have both exploded and unexploded molecules within it ( a notion that led Schrödinger to create his famous cat - in - a - box thought experiment ) .
This " neither here nor there " quantum state is what can be controlled in this new molecule simply by altering the voltage of the transistor .
Until now , the challenge had been to create a computer semiconductor in which the quantum state could be controlled , creating a qubit .
" If you want to build a quantum computer you have to be able to control the occupancy of the quantum states , " Klimeck says .
" We can control the location of the electron in this artificial atom and , therefore , control the quantum state with an externally applied electrical field . "
The discovery began when Sven Rogge and his colleagues at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands were experimenting with nano - scale transistors that show the effects of unintentional impurities , or dopants .
The researchers found properties in the current - voltage characteristics of the transistor that indicated electrons were being transported by a single atom , but it was unclear what impurity was causing this effect .

Physicist Lloyd Hollenberg and colleagues at the University of Melbourne in Australia were able to construct a theoretical silicon - based quantum computer chip based on the concept of using an individual impurity .
" The team found that the measurements only made sense if the molecule was considered to be made of two parts , " Hollenberg says .
" One end comprised the arsenic atom embedded in the silicon , while the ' artificial ' end of the molecule forms near the silicon surface of the transistor .
A single electron was spread across both ends .
" What is strange about the ' surface ' end of the molecule is that it occurs as an artifact when we apply electrical current across the transistor and hence can be considered ' manmade . '
We have no equivalent form existing naturally in the world around us . "
Klimeck , along with graduate student Rajib Rahman , developed an updated version of the nano - electronics modeling program NEMO 3 - D to simulate the material at the size of 3 million atoms .
" We needed to model such a large number of atoms to see the new , extended quantum characteristics , " Klimeck says .
The simulation showed that the new molecule is a hybrid , with the naturally occurring arsenic at one end in a normal spherical shape and a new , artificial atom at the other end in a flattened , 2 - D shape .
By controlling the voltage , the researchers found that they could make an electron go to either end of the molecule or exist in an intermediate , quantum , state .
This model was then made into an image by David Ebert , a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Purdue , and graduate student Insoo Woo .
Delft 's Rogge says the discovery also highlights the current capabilities of designing electronic machines .
" Our experiment made us realize that industrial electronic devices have now reached the level where we can study and manipulate the state of a single atom , " Rogge says .
" This is the ultimate limit , you can not get smaller than that . "
Listen : on this chilly afternoon at the end of March , Blean Woods are reverberating with birdsong .
Several robins are uttering the twittering warbles that proclaim their territory , a chiffchaff is slipping out its metronomic , two - note call , and every couple of minutes a green woodpecker fires off its yaffle – its staccato burst of notes carries through the trees .
Over it all a song thrush is singing from the top of a still - leafless chestnut , silhouetted against the sky ; it is enormously loud for such a squib of a thing , each phrase repeated with such cold sweet clarity that it triggers in the mind Philip Larkin 's memorable catching of just such a bird , singing in a garden at just this time of year : " its fresh - peeled voice / astonishing the brickwork " .
Good place for birds , then , Blean .
The woods stretch for miles over the rolling hilly ground to the north - west of Canterbury , one of the largest continuous blocks of ancient broadleaved woodland in southern England ; in fact they 're second only to the New Forest in their extent .
For more than a thousand years they were owned by various ecclesiastical establishments in Canterbury ; now the part where I am standing constitutes Blean Woods National Nature Reserve , owned and managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds ( RSPB ) , in partnership with Natural England , the Woodland Trust , and three local councils .
I am talking to Michael Walter , who has been the RSPB warden , continuously , since his society took over the woodland in 1982 , and as might be expected , we are talking birds .
You can see a lot in Blean : the woods hold all three native British woodpeckers , nuthatches and tree creepers , several warbler species , good numbers of nightingales and solid populations of the commoner birds such as wrens , robins , tits and thrushes .
But we are n't talking about what 's here .
We 're talking about what 's not here any more .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
In the quarter - century since Michael Walter came to look after Blean Woods , they have suffered a remarkable series of declines in their breeding bird species .
Eight have become extinct altogether , birds that were nesting in the woods when he arrived , and have now vanished .
He enumerates them : cuckoo , redstart , wood warbler , golden oriole , hawfinch , willow tit , yellowhammer and starling .
Seven more species have suffered severe declines : turtle dove , tree pipit , spotted flycatcher , whitethroat , marsh tit , nuthatch and jackdaw ( some of them barely clinging on ) .
This has happened despite the fact that the warden is an expert on actively managing woods for birds , and has spent 25 years striving to make Blean as ideal an avian habitat as it could possibly be .
But Michael Walter 's experience is not unique .
It is a reflection of a disquieting development taking place over much of Britain : the decline of our woodland birds .
In recent years ornithologists have recognised that a dozen or so largely woodland species are plunging in numbers , to the point where the graphs of their decline slope down sharply towards extinction .
We are already aware of catastrophic declines in one section of our avifauna : the birds of farmland .
Starting somewhere about 1960 , familiar species that once enlivened every country walk , such as the grey partridge , the skylark , the lapwing and the yellowhammer , began to fall in numbers and then disappear , to the point where nowadays there are whole regions where they can no longer be encountered .
They made a desert , and they called it farming .
In 30 years , the corn bunting – a fat finch with a song like a jangled bunch of keys – declined by 87 per cent .
Our native grey partridge went down by 86 per cent ( the partridge you will see in most of Britain now is its cousin , the red- legged or French version ) .
The starling – common as muck , used to be everywhere – declined by 80 per cent .
The turtle dove declined by 77 per cent , the linnet by 68 per cent , the skylark by 60 per cent , and so it went on .
This unpardonable impoverishment of our natural world has become a major concern ; reversing these declines is now an official Government objective .
Yet there is one consolation : there is a single cause , which is known .
Agricultural intensification .
When modern farming methods replaced the age - old ways of doing things , they impacted direly on birds that were dependent upon the practice of agriculture .
As new techniques were brought in – the planting of winter as well as summer crops with consequent loss of autumn stubble fields , the replacement of hay with silage , the switch from old meadows to modern grasslands , the drenching of fields in pesticides and let 's not forget the manic , mass tearing - out of hedges in the absurd years of overproduction under the European Union 's Common Agricultural Policy – the niches , the living spaces where farmland birds were able to feed and breed , disappeared .
Yet at least the reason was apparent , so remedial action could be taken ( in the form of stewardship schemes under which farmers are paid to recreate the older wildlife habitats ) .
With woodland birds , it is different .
There is no one obvious explanation for the disappearances .
Instead there are several factors that seem to have come into play at the same time , and so affected a wide range of species .
Furthermore , the woodland declines were less obvious , for you know when you do n't hear skylarks any more on your walk across the fields , but when hawfinches vanish from the leafy canopy of your wood , you may not have known that these handsome but secretive songbirds were there in the first place .
Yet about the time of the Millennium they began to be picked up , and the British Trust for Ornithology ( BTO ) , the UK 's leading scientific bird research organisation , decided to examine them in detail .
Its study reported in 2003 with surprising results .
Over the previous 35 years , there appeared to have been declines of greater than 50 per cent in 10 woodland bird species , which in order of magnitude were : spotted flycatcher , lesser spotted woodpecker , lesser whitethroat , lesser redpoll , tree pipit , willow tit , marsh tit , woodcock , dunnock and willow warbler .
Other sources of information suggested there had been significant losses in a further group of species , including hawfinch , wood warbler , and nightingale .
The BTO then decided to have an even closer look at what was happening , and joined forces with the RSPB for a large - scale investigation : the Repeat Woodland Bird Survey ( RWBS ) .
This looked again at 406 woods that between them the two bodies had surveyed 20 years earlier , and in 2006 came up with its own picture , confirming much of the first study , but adjusting its findings in what was probably a more accurate way .
The top 10 declines the RWBS registered , in its own order of magnitude , were : tree pipit , hawfinch , willow tit , willow warbler , lesser spotted woodpecker , lesser redpoll , wood warbler , redstart , garden warbler and spotted flycatcher .
Some of these are among the most appealing creatures on God 's earth .
Take the two that are labelled spotted , the spotted flycatcher and the lesser spotted woodpecker .
( Neither is all that spotted . )
The first is about as sober in its colour scheme as it is possible to be , plain grey - brown above and pale below , but there is a harmony in its shape , a restrained elegance in its upright pose , that is quite captivating .
The second is a woodpecker in miniature , with all a woodpecker 's charismatic liveliness and colour – black , white and scarlet like its great spotted cousin , increasingly familiar on garden bird tables – yet this thing is the size of a mobile phone , and so elusive that just catching sight of one feels like a triumph .
All these birds , in fact , have their own charm : the willow warbler 's descending fall of song is one of the emblematic sounds of spring ( seep - seep sip - sip sep- sep sop - sop sup - sip ) ; its cousin the wood warbler , green and lemon - yellow , shivers its whole body when it sings ; the hawfinch , hunky , bull - necked and pinkish - brown , would be the nearest thing we have in Britain to a parrot if we did n't now have the ring - necked parakeet ; and the redstart , with its plumage of orange , slate - blue , black and white , is the most exotic decoration you 're likely to see on a British fir tree short of Christmas .
And we 're losing them .
Why ?
To take the most direct possibility : is it predation ?
Might other creatures be killing them off ?
The answer is , perhaps – in some cases .
Grey squirrels are the likeliest candidates ; their populations in Britain continue to soar , and in their native American homeland they are major predators of birds ' nests .
The trouble is , there is little direct evidence , although the nest of a hawfinch on a branch in a wood canopy is in exactly the sort of place where a grey squirrel would encounter it .
More outlandish candidates are great spotted woodpeckers , which have shot up in numbers enormously ; they are known to predate upon their lesser spotted cousins , killing and eating the chicks in the nest .
Conventional predators , such as sparrowhawks , crows and magpies , are all doing well , but again , there is simply no evidence that they are affecting whole populations .
A subtler thought is this .
Has something gone wrong with the woods themselves ?
The answer is , more likely .
Successful living space for several bird species in British woods has long depended on a traditional type of woodland management , many hundreds , if not thousands of years , old : coppicing .
This means cutting trees down to ground level , and then letting new shoots grow back up from the resultant stumps , or stools .
Coppicing provides a steady supply of long straight wood poles , traditionally used in fence making and for firewood , but for birds , it also provides , in its early stages , a dense shrubby layer , similar to the garrigue , the aromatic bushy landscape of Mediterranean countries , which is perfect for species such as nightingales and warblers to nest in .
From about the middle of the 20th century , however , coppicing began to be abandoned .
When that happens , the shrub layer disappears ; but not only that .
When the trees grow up , eventually the canopy closes , shutting out the light ; and the rest of the undergrowth , the brambles and bushes and plants that form the layer of ground flora , where other bird species love to forage and breed , dies off .
Undoubtedly the abandoning of coppicing has played a part in woodland bird decline .
And unfortunately , its negative effects are being strongly reinforced by another factor : deer .
Virtually all species of deer in Britain are steadily increasing in numbers , led by the muntjac , a pint - sized Bambi introduced from China , whose speciality is breeding all year round .
In many of Britain 's woods , the browsing of deer is now so extensive that it is causing large - scale structural changes to the vegetation : in effect , Bambi and his pals are eating the undergrowth to bits .
This is definitely affecting bird populations .
But why are deer booming ?
One reason : there is more food in the landscape , because crops are now in the fields all the year round .
Another reason is probably climate change : winters are substantially warmer than 30 years ago , and many more young deer are surviving .
Climate change = warmer winters = more deer = less undergrowth = fewer birds .
It 's a fairly long chain , although it looks a likely one .
But climate change may also be acting directly on some woodland bird species .
One candidate is the willow tit , a chunky , darker relative of the more familiar blue tits and great tits , which has suffered one of the worst declines .
Over much of southern Britain , it has gone , or is going , extinct .
It may be suffering from competition with blue and great tits which stock up on our garden feeders then go back into the woods to breed .
But there is another possibility to do with the fact that the willow tit is the only tit which excavates its own nest hole .
To do this it seems to need damp woods , but with rising temperatures , some woods which were once damp are now drying out .
Climate change may also be acting in a subtler way : creating a mismatch between the moment when abundant bird food appears in spring – in particular , lots of small caterpillars on oaks and other trees – and the moment when migratory birds wintering in Africa , arrive back in Britain to breed .
The two used to occur together , but warmer springs mean oak leaves are sprouting earlier , and the caterpillars are emerging earlier with them ; yet birds in Africa cannot see this happening , and come back at the same time as before , and so may be missing out on the abundance , and breeding less successfully .
Research in the Netherlands indicates this is happening with pied flycatchers ; it may well happen with other migrants .
Migrants , yes .
There , perhaps is the most suggestive thought of all .
If we look at all three lists of declining woodland birds mentioned above , in each case about half are long - distance migrant species that spend every winter in Africa south of the Sahara , and come back here to nest in the summer .
There are seven of them in total : spotted flycatcher , wood warbler , tree pipit , redstart , willow warbler , garden warbler and golden oriole .
All these woodland migrants are declining rapidly .
Picture them , tiny things , featherballs weighing a few grammes , which twice a year make journeys of thousands of miles across Europe , the Mediterranean , North Africa and then the world 's harshest desert , facing hunger , thirst , heat , exhaustion , storms , predators and the seemingly impossible conundrum of navigation – often at night .
In between , they wander the great continent for six months , seeking a living , seeking survival , and we know very little about where they go or what they do .
It seems incredible that they can succeed in coming back , year after year , to woodlands in Norfolk and Dorset , in Wales and Scotland – so would it be so strange if , one day , they were to fail ?
The decline in our woodland birds is thus alerting ornithologists to perhaps an even bigger problem – that the system of bird migration between Europe and Africa , millions of years old , may be running into trouble .
Perhaps this too is climate change ; perhaps it 's habitat loss ; nobody knows .
A major research effort is just beginning , and the more scientists look , the more it seems that migrants are encountering difficulties , either on their epic journeys to and fro , or on their African wintering grounds .
What this means for somebody like Michael Walter at Blean Woods in Kent is that however hard he tries , there are some bird declines that he can do nothing about .
And he has certainly tried hard .
Over the past 25 years – he's 59 now – he has managed the coppicing of the woods so well that he still has good numbers of nightingales , willow warblers and garden warblers , all migrants that are plunging in numbers over much of England .
But his wood warblers have gone , his golden orioles have gone , and his redstarts have gone ; his turtle doves have collapsed in numbers , as have his spotted flycatchers , his tree pipits are hanging on by their clawtips ( a single pair bred last year ) and in 2007 , for the first time in his quarter century as their custodian , Michael Walter did not record a single cuckoo in Blean Woods .
" The fact that I was coppicing intensively would have led me to believe that some of these species would at least have held their own , but instead , the declines here are just mirroring what 's happening on a national scale , and that is certainly frustrating , " he said .
" What 's the point in slugging our guts out doing the coppicing if we 're not going to benefit all these species ?
What 's the point of having a reserve , if all these lovely birds are going to disappear ? "
He agrees that the causes are complex , but the phenomenon is real .
" It would be an enormous coincidence for so many species to disappear or go down at the same time , so there is something at work , or a range of somethings .
But we 're still at the stage of proposing causes , and trying to establish whether they are related or not . "
He certainly feels it , personally .
Especially with the disappearing cuckoo .
" A bird like a cuckoo is emblematic , a symbol of spring .
When you stop hearing them , you really do feel that something 's gone desperately wrong . "

Threatened American jobs and higher gas prices were the points of attack that deep - sixed the latest effort to put a price on U.S. greenhouse gas emissions — a cap - and - trade bill that died in the Senate on Friday .
This defensive posture , seeking to preserve energy - intensive transportation and industries , is short - sighted in light of the transition to alternative forms of energy underway worldwide .
China gets it .
Not only is it racing to implement renewable energy ( ie setting a nationwide renewable portfolio standard for utilities , installing enough wind power in just the last two years to edge out wind - energy pioneer Denmark for fifth place in the Global Wind Energy Council ’s annual capacity rankings , and building a photovoltaics export business essentially overnight ) .
China designs these initiatives to favor the development of domestic industries .
In a recent article for Spectrum magazine I show how China ’s dramatic installation of wind power parks is occuring despite rock - bottom pricing — a situation that analysts say favors local players .
See China Doubles Wind Watts in Spectrum ’s May 2008 issue .
Note that while John McCain and Barack Obama both claim to get it on both green jobs and climate change , neither bothered to show up for Friday ’s vote .

It ’s a really difficult choice .
That ’s why we ’ve put together this brief guide to give you the 5 simple tips which can help you to create a domain name which magnetizes customers to your website .
Let ’s go !
1. Keep It Short and Simple
The best domain names are short and simple .
You need to allow your customers to be able to type your domain name without any confusions .
You should avoid the use of slang and colloquialisms , such as “ u ” instead of you and “ 2 ” instead of “ to . ”
Also , do n’t use words with could be spelled numerous ways correctly .
For example , “ advisor ” or “ adviser . ”
It ’s also best to keep your domain name as short as possible .
You do n’t your audience typing an essay to find your website .
This way you make it easy for your audience to find your website .
You can learn more about your domain name on this website .
2. Include Keywords
Always include keywords related to your industry or sector .
Your domain name should refer to your services .
For example , if your company name is “ Red Paint ” and you ’re a painter and decorator .
Your domain name could be : redpaintdectorator.com
This helps your audience identify your services .
But it ’s also good for your search engine optimization ( SEO ) strategy .
3. Include Your Location
You can also consider including your location in your domain name .
This can be your state , region or city .
For example , take the example of “ Red Paint . ”
If the company was based in New York , it could be called : redpaintnewyork.com .
If your customer base is located in a specific location , then this can boost your visibility among this group .
4. Avoid Hyphens and Numbers
You should also know that hyphens and numbers should be avoided .
People do n’t know whether your company name includes the number or the word .
For example , if your domain name was redpaintone.com , people may think you ’re called redpaint1.com .
It ’s also common for people to mistake a dash for a hyphen .
It ’s best just to avoid these altogether .
5. Hurry !
It ’s good to carry out research and consider carefully what your domain name is going to be .
Once you choose one , you ca n’t go back !
But , do n’t take too long to decide .
As the internet continues to expand , domain names are being bought up all the time .
You need to hurry to get the domain name which works for your company .
The good news is that you can still find affordable domain names for sale .
The bad news is that they ’re selling out fast .

The study was prepared by
LMI Government Consulting
for the Department of Defense .
The aim , LMI says , is to develop an approach to establishing a DoD energy strategy .
( see my comments on the study :
Much Ado for Nothing : Transforming the Way DoD Looks at Energy .
)

Did USCENTCOM give the LMI and Max Boot such a data ?
Or somehow the figure is based on
my estimates in June 2006
?
Or we all are using a mutant statistics ?
[ 3 ]
For the period of 1964 to 1970 .
In May 2007 I posted here an article entitled US Military Energy Consumption - Facts and Figures .
In FACT 13 , I claimed that American GI is the most energy - consuming soldier ever seen on the field of war .
I see that statistics on fuel consumption per US soldier is getting much attention and attraction .
The last news report citing that issue was Military Feels Fuel - Cost Gouge in Iraq in April 2008 .
In this post I try give an overview of all the reported statistics on per US soldier oil consumption ( abroad ) .
Well , good luck if you see any consistent and meaningful figure .
In March 2006 , Carlton Meyer , a former Marine officer who runs G2mil Quarterly , a Web site on military issues , was quoted saying " The U.S. Army burned 12 times more fuel per soldier in Iraq than it did in France in 1944 -- nine gallons of fuel per soldier per day in 2004 .
" How much fuel was then consumed per US Army soldier in France in 1944 ?
Well , basic arithmetic applied to Carlton Meyer ’s claim indicates 0.75 gallon / soldier / day .
In May 2005 issue of The Atlantic Monthly , Robert Bryce stated that “ The Third Army ( of General Patton ) had about 400,000 men and used about 400,000 gallons of gasoline a day . ”
This makes one gallon per day per soldier .
O.K. you can round up 0.75 to 1 gallon / soldier / day .
But remember that it is Patton ’s soldiers in France in 1944 , and not per US soldier in World War II .
A presentation accompanying the Defense Science Board report called DoD Energy Strategy " More Fight - Less Fuel " ( released on February 12 , 2008 ) shows that 1.8 million gallons of fuel per day was consumed by 1,075,681 soldiers in 1944 .
This makes 1.67 gallons / soldier / day .
I do not know what that figure refers to in 1944 ( deployed soldiers ? ) but surely it does not refer to Patton ’s Third Army .
What had stuck me most in a LMI study ( “ Transforming the Way DoD Looks at Energy : An Approach to Establishing an Energy Strategy ” released on May 8 , 2007 ) [ 1 ] was its US military oil consumption estimates in Afghanistan and Iraq .
LMI study quotes an article of Max Boot in LA times in July 2006 saying about 2.4 million gallons ( 57,000 barrels ) of fuel is consumed every day in Iraq and Afghanistan . [ 2 ]
Based on the data , apparently provided by the U.S. Central Command , LMI study says , “ DoD is using approximately 57,000 barrels a day , at a cost of about $ 3 million per day .
This equates to about 16 gallons per soldier per day [ in 2006 ] .
This is significantly more than the 2005 consumption rate of 9 gallons per soldier .
These numbers make it clear that energy consumption for military operations has increased dramatically in the last 15 years .
In Desert Storm , consumption was 4 gallons per soldier per soldier , and in World War II , consumption was only 1 gallon per day per soldier .
” DSB study presentation shows that 4.1 million gallons of fuel was consumed by 150,000 soldiers in Iraq in 2004 .
This equates to 27.3 gallons / soldier / day .
I questioned the reliability of those figures several times .
Here is my conclusion :
It is not possible to come up with such a fuel consumption of 16 or 9 gallons per SOLDIER per day , simply because of the inexact nature of number of soldiers used as denominator .
The US military oil consumption statistics especially in terms of per soldier per day is very confusing .
It is better to use military oil consumption per day .
According to my estimates US military oil consumption abroad was 42.8 kbd ( 1000 barrels per day ) in World War II .
It jumped to 74.1 kbd in Vietnam War [ 3 ] and to 152 kbd in Gulf War ( Operation Desert Shield / Storm ) .
And IF you believe the DoD figures , the US military consumes less than 50 kbd in Iraq .

There has been a recent spate of reports about the illegal harassment of innocent photographers , train and plane spotters , and of peaceful demonstrators exercising their rights of peaceful , lawful protest etc. by officious , jobsworth , ignorant or poorly trained private security guards , Police Community Service Officers or by genuine Police Constables ,
There are also ongoing " Climate of Fear " propaganda campaigns , which seek to make innocent public photographers or mobile phone users into terrorist suspects .
These all deserve public apologies and disciplinary or criminal investigations into those responsible for them ,
See Photography does NOT equal Terrorism "
It is worth remembering , however , that there are actually some places where photography is illegal .
Written answers Monday 16 Jun 2008 : Column 667W
Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Government Communication Headquarters : Photography Mark Harper ( Shadow Minister , Work & Pensions ; Forest of Dean , Conservative )
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs for what reasons and on what authority photography at the Government Communications Headquarters has been prohibited David Miliband ( Secretary of State , Foreign & Commonwealth Office ; South Shields , Labour ) holding answer 13 June 2008 Section 1 of the Official Secrets
Act 1911 makes it an offence for any person for any purpose prejudicial to the safety or interests of the state to approach , inspect or be in the neighbourhood of a ' prohibited place ' or to make or otherwise obtain a sketch ( a term which encompasses a photograph ) which might be directly or indirectly useful to a potential enemy .
All Government Communications
Headquarters sites are prohibited places for the purposes of the Act .
This Labour Government abuses the supposed Parliamentary legislative safeguard , of having a Secretary of State personally scrutinising and signing an Order , or having to be Notified of a Request , to suspend normal laws , in a narrowly defined geographical area , on a temporary basis only , which they , as our supposedly democratically elected representatives have the power to Authorise , Amend or Refuse or Revoke .
They have demonstrated this abusive preference for general repression through Kafkaesque secret laws , which the general public cannot know whether they are being applied in a particular place , at a particular time or not , by their refusal to list when and where Terrorism Act 200 Section 44 stop and search without reasonable suspicion powers are or have been in force - see Home Office Terrorism Act 2000 s44 authorisations FOIA request correspondence archive .
We wonder if the Government will , in its usual secretive manner , also attempt to keep secret , what is already known to our enemies and allies through aerial and satellite reconnaissance i.e. the locations of such " Prohibited Places " .
Perhaps it is time for another Freedom of Information Act request .
[ UPDATE July 3rd 2008 - " The Home Office does not hold the information that you have requested . " see this Spy Blog UK FOIA requests blog article - The War on Tourism and Photographers - where are the Prohibited Places under the Official Secrets Act 1911 ?]
These " Prohibited Places " are defined in the Official Secrets Act 1911 section 3 Definition of prohibited place :
Amazon ( TGW ) – Cleaner air due to fewer coal fired power plants could destroy the Amazon by the end of this century , according to researchers .
Reduced sulphur dioxide emissions by power plants causes increased sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic , which boosts drought risk in the Amazon .
" Generally pollution is a bad thing but in this case improving the air may have ironically led to a drying of the Amazon , " said Peter Cox , a researcher at the University of Exeter in Britain , who led the study .
The researchers used a climate - carbon model to simulate the impacts of future climate change on the Amazon and compared it to data from a 2005 drought that devastated a large chunk of the rainforest .
They estimated that by 2025 a drought on the same scale could happen every other year and by 2060 such a crisis could hit nine out of every ten years -- enough to turn the rainforest into savannah grassland , Cox said .
The Amazon holds one tenth of the world ’s carbon dioxide .

Jon sez ,
This video is of a man filming a cop who parked illegally in front of a fire hydrant .
He follows her , asking questions , and she mostly ignores him .

August 13 , 2007 — Portland , Oregon
Portland to Host Terrorism Drill “ NOBLE RESOLVE 07 - 2 ” Aug. 20 to 24
Citizens Warn of Established Pattern for Such Drills to go “ live ”

This is an urgent advisory notice from concerned citizens of Oregon and Washington about an upcoming U.S. Joint Forces Command emergency management exercise known as NOBLE RESOLVE 07 - 2 that will simulate terrorism or disaster scenarios in the Lower Columbia River Basin between Aug. 20th and Aug 24th , 2007 .
NOBLE RESOLVE 07 - 2 was designed and will be directed by U.S. Joint Forces Command ( USJFCOM ) and the Department of Homeland Security .
We are aware of no public notice concerning this exercise , but preliminary investigation has revealed that Oregon National Guard officials and federal officials will conduct the drill .
Details from official sources are minimal .
This advisory is to document our concerns , raise public awareness and urge citizen action based on the following facts :
1. NOBLE RESOLVE is a computer - based simulation of a large - scale emergency situation ( e.g. earthquake , hurricane , tsunami , or terrorist attack with nuclear weapon ) in order to train for managing all aspects of the emergency response through comprehensive software .
2. Military exercises such as NOBLE RESOLVE 07 - 2 have a recent history of coinciding with lethal “ live ” events .
This occurred both at the start of Desert Storm in 1990 and on 9/11/01 when five or more major military or security exercises were in progress on the very day of the actual attacks .
The same phenomenon occurred with the London Bombings of 7/7/05 during which a drill concerning multiple bomb attacks was being staged on that day .
4. The May 2007 Presidential Directive NSPD 51 ( HSPD 20 ) addressing “ continuity of government ” in the event of a massive emergency , includes secret " annexes " which are pertinent additional documents .
Some US Congressional Committee on Homeland Security members such as Rep. Peter DeFazio have written to formally request permission to review these secret " annexes " and have twice been denied access by the White House .
5 . This particular exercise , NOBLE RESOLVE 07 - 2 , includes one scenario involving an unaccounted for , " loose , " ten kiloton nuclear weapon , exactly as Vice President Cheney hinted in recent interviews .
Department of Homeland Security chief Michael Chertoff claims he fears the same .
6 . The plummeting support for the GOP has triggered comments from its members and analyses of its current political strategy that point to a new 9/11 attack as a contributing factor to GOP political salvation .
Moreover , it appears that legends or back stories are being disseminated to support just such an event .
Transparency concerning NOBLE RESOLVE 07 - 2 is vital for the public safety of everyone in the Lower Columbia River Basin .
We call on the planners , directors and participants in NOBLE RESOLVE 07 - 2 to be vigilant and to maintain transparency with respect to these military exercises .
We also urge citizens and our elected officials to monitor the activities of participants connected with the exercises and alert authorities to any suspicious behavior .
These exercises have an established pattern of becoming “ live ” events .
( Please read references below . )
We recommend that officials of the Ports of Astoria , Longview , Vancouver and Portland on the Lower Columbia River take extra care in their monitoring and examination of all shipping on the Lower Columbia River while NOBLE RESOLVE 07 - 2 is in progress .
Finally , we urge all concerned to voice that concern in letters and calls to elected officials and civil servants requesting full transparency and citizen oversight .

There are many available tools to help make web development projects quicker and more productive .
Aside from a handy text editor or WYSIWYG editor like Dreamweaver , you can find plenty of tools and utilities that can greatly increase development speed , reduce debugging and testing time , and improve quality of the output .
The tools described below are a variety of utilities , optimizers , testing , and debugging tools aimed towards helping developers create websites more efficiently .
1. CSS Grid Builder
CSS Grid Builder is an online GUI for customizing the YUI Grids CSS – a lightweight CSS framework developed by Yahoo ! that comes with over 1000 page layout combinations .
The CSS Grid Builder allows you to rapidly generate a CSS - based , web - standards compliant page layout in a matter of minutes ( or even seconds ) .
Once you ’ve got the page layout the way you want it , all you have to do is press “ Show Code ” and it generates the HTML for you .
You do n’t even have to host the CSS file on your web server ( saving you some bandwidth and maintenance hassles ) , the generated code links to the appropriate stylesheet found on Yahoo ! ’s Developer Network API .
Using CSS sprites is an excellent way to improve web page performance by reducing the number of HTTP requests needed for rendering images , but it can take a lot of planning , measuring , and coding if done manually .
CSS Sprite Generator allows you to upload all of your images ( you have to place them in a .zip file first ) and it will combine the uploaded images into a single sprite and also generate the CSS for you .
Blueprint reduces the amount of CSS code you have to write by including common styles that developers typically use such CSS reset and page layouts .
A demonstration of a web page that uses Blueprint can be found here .
CSSTidy is an open source application that parses , fixes , and optimizes CSS code to reduce file size and also to standardize CSS code formatting automatically .
It also finds and removes redundant styles and properties .
You can adjust CSSTidy ’s settings to your preferred compression level but even the default setting can often give you 30 % compression according to the creators of CSSTidy .
Check out the “ before and after ” examples to get a feel for how CSSTidy works .
logicss is a collection of CSS files and PHP utilities aimed at reducing web development time .
It allows developers to create customizable fixed , elastic , or fluid ( liquid ) layout grids .
Check out the preview of their CSS code generation tool .
6. ___layouts
___layouts is a very simple CSS framework that can be used to create web - standards compliant page layouts .
___layouts was inspired by Yahoo ! ’s Grids CSS and offers 5 preset widths that supports fluid - width or fixed - width layouts .
Much like Yahoo ! ’s Grid.css , ___layouts also has a web - based Layout Builder that was developed for the Firefox browser .
Caution : the Layout Builder is still in its early stages of development , so things may be buggy at times .
Clean AJAX speeds up Ajax development by cutting down the amount of code you have to write ( and rewrite ) , giving you access to common and proven design patterns used in Ajax applications .
Clean AJAX can be used with any server - side technology such as PHP , RoR , and .NET because it ’s JavaScript - based .
Check out the demo page so you can see Clean AJAX in action .
8. Sajax
Sajax ( which stands for “ Simple Ajax Toolkit ” ) is an open source framework developed to speed up the creation of Ajax applications .
It supports major sever - side technologies such as ASP , Cold Fusion , PHP , Perl , Python , and Ruby .
Sajax has a fairly large community of over 39,000 registered users on their forums – so if you run into any troubles while developing a Sajax - based application or if you want to showcase your work , you ’ll be sure to have an audience .
DOMTool was created to cut down the time it takes to code DOM structures .
Creating DOM statements is as simple as copying your HTML code into the DOMTool and then clicking a button .
It ’s not meant to be used as a simple copy - and - paste solution and you should verify and optimize the output , but it gives you a great starting point .
10 . JavaScript Code Improver
JavaScript Code Improver is a simple , no - frills application that allows you to quickly tidy up and format your JavaScript .
It ’s a great way for a team of developers to standardize JavaScript code format for easier readability and collaboration .
11 . JSUnit
JSUnit is a unit testing framework for JavaScript .
Testing JavaScript manually is time - consuming and prone to errors , but JSUnit provides the developer a simpler , automated way of doing unit tests to ensure thorough testing at a fraction of the time it would take to test manually .
JSUnit allows for the execution of automated tests for multiple browsers and operating systems .
12 . Test plugin for JavaScriptMVC
The Test plugin for JavaScriptMVC is another excellent JavaScript testing framework to help make development speedier .
It was created with the concept of “ JavaScript testing sucks … so we want to make it easier ” in mind .
The Test plugin is a comprehensive set of utilities allowing you to do unit tests as well as simulate user interaction that can occur in a web page .
Venkman is a JavaScript debugging environment for Firefox 2 , Netscape , and Seamonkey .
It gives you a GUI for stepping through JavaScript code and setting break points .
It also comes with a command - line interface built in .
Venkman is an extension that you can easily install and download through the Firefox Add- ons section of Mozilla.org .
14 . Firebug
Firebug is a Mozilla Firefox extension that gives you plenty of web development tools and features .
Firebug has a built - in JavaScript debugger that lets you step through your script as well as allowing you to perform benchmarks to see why your script is slow / sluggish .
You can quickly hunt down CSS , HTML , JavaScript , and XML errors through Firebug , and it even allows you to filter and search for specific errors .
Another handy feature is the DOM inspector pane which outlines a web page ’s structure ; very handy if you ’re working on a big website or an open - source application that you ’ve recently gotten involved with .
It ’s an awesome tool though I find that disabling Firebug when I ’m not using it is helpful in speeding up normal browsing ( such accessing Gmail , for example ) .
Web Developer extension is a very handy and time - saving extension for Firefox .
I ’ve written and recommended it plenty of times and is an extension that I use daily .
You can rapidly validate your XHTML , find JavaScript / CSS errors , visualize a web page ’s structure , quickly fill out web forms for testing purposes , clear your cache with a shortcut key , change XHTML on - the - fly ( great for working remotely on a web design ) , inspect HTTP headers information , and much more .
16 . Internet Explorer Developer Toolbar
Even if you prefer Firefox ( or Safari ) to develop and test your web pages , you have to test your stuff in the Internet Explorer browser for cross-compatibility .
Whenever I test in IE , there are plenty of times when I wish certain features in Firebug and the Web Developer extension are accessible through IE , such as the DOM inspector option or the CSS Information option .
IE Developer Toolbar is the IE add - on that provides me the features I like in my Firefox extensions .
17 . Yahoo !
Design Pattern Library
The Yahoo !
Design Pattern Library is a large collection of proven optimal web design patterns to save you time in creating highly - sophisticated design solutions .
Some things that you can find in the Design Pattern Library are : breadcrumb navigation , auto - complete for web forms , and drag - and - drop solutions .

Perhaps the biggest revelation from Scott McClellan ’s bombshell book about his time at the White House is that President Bush directly authorized the leak of Valerie Plame ’s identity :
During the interview , Scottie revealed the two things that really pissed him off with the Bush Administration .
First , being set up to lie by Karl Rove and Scooter Libby .
And second , learning that Bush had –himself –authorized the selective leaking of the NIE .
Scottie McC :
But the other defining moment was in early April 2006 , when I learned that the President had secretly declassified the National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq for the Vice President and Scooter Libby to anonymously disclose to reporters .
And we had been out there talking about how seriously the President took the selective leaking of classified information .
And here we were , learning that the President had authorized the very same thing we had criticized .

Obama and Clinton are expected back in Washington today for a vote to change civil rights law to make it easier for workers to sue for pay discrimination long after the initial act of alleged discrimination .
Harry Reid is convening the Senate this evening to accomodate the candidates ' schedules .
A McCain aide , Brian Rogers , says the Republican is n't coming back for the vote .
Two nineteen - year - old girls hold up their T - shirts to show off the matching tattoos on their lower backs .
The tats are the logo for Primos , the kerosene - and - tire shop where they 've hung out , sometimes for hours at a time , every day since they started high school .
" I just showed up for a barbecue one year and never left , " Bethany says .
" I 've never had a big family .
It 's been nice having this instead . "
Bethany and Lindsey are juggalettes , and that means Primos is home .
A couple dozen juggalos and juggalettes — many dressed in red , one in a hooded cape and black lipstick — are hanging out in the Primos parking lot on a Saturday afternoon .
Hot dogs sizzle on the grill , and while a few of the guys have 40 - ounce beers in brown paper bags , most hold tight to bottles of Faygo .
" It 's like a living , breathing MySpace for juggalos around here , " says Wayne , who 's just bought his pop in Primos ' tiny store .
Wayne stops here at least twice a week to see what 's going on .
But he'd have to be a pretty reclusive juggalo not to know the agenda for this weekend — when Insane Clown Posse and the entire Psychopathic Records label descend on Denver for shows at the Gothic and Red Rocks .
The owners of Primos will be there , too , handing out free bottles of Faygo from their tricked - out Primos van .

" I 've been a juggalette since the day I was born , " says seven - year - old Sierra , proudly pointing to her juggalette T - shirt and her bike , emblazoned with Primos and Denver City Killaz stickers .
DCK 's frontman , Franky , is a lanky nineteen - year - old who discovered ICP when he was eleven .
He gives Sierra props for the sticker , then hobbles over to a cluster of rappers who 've been growing a horror - rap scene that caters to Denver 's massive juggalo community , the largest in the country .
Franky busted his ankle two nights before , and his right foot is twice the size of his left — but he 's got drugs to numb the pain until he feels like going to the emergency room .
For now , he 's trying to unload some chronic .
He starts , unsuccessfully , with Scum — the biggest and darkest act in the growing underground horror - core / gore - hop scene , who rhymes about dismemberment and cannibalism .
" We do n't go out killing people , " Bethany says .
" We just use the music as a release . "
" And the message behind it is completely different , " says 21 - year - old Jerrica , who first came to Primos looking for Faygo but soon began using the shop as a refuge when she did n't have food or money , or could n't take the kids at school anymore .
" They throw all that in to attract the kids who are having a fucked - up time . "
When Denver School of the Arts student JD Gonzales entered the national My City Now contest a few years ago , he had to create a video about what made his city a great place to live .
His answer : a little tire shop near Alameda and Sheridan called Primos , " A Juggalo Home in Denver 's Zone . "
While the camera pans across a dozen kids sitting on the ground outside the shop , outfitted in baggy red and black clothes , tattoos , piercings and long dreads , the voice of Kiki Rodriguez , a Primos owner , explains ICP 's draw : " All these kids do n't have shit .
They would n't have nothing , dude .
But because they 're a juggalo , that 's a big part of their life .
It gives them something to fucking do , something to be proud of . "
Childish , a member of the rap group Brutally Vicious Killaz , tells the camera that Primos is a place where juggalos get together like family .
There 's no other place like it in Denver ; he doubts there 's another place like it anywhere .
" Denver juggalos are the lifeline of Denver , " Kiki continues .
" Everybody thinks , how can that be ?
How can all these scruffy kids have anything important to do with our Mile High City ?
Juggalos , we 're the backbone , yo ....
We 're all one family .
We 're united .
We 're from everywhere .
Jocks are juggalos .
Rich kids are juggalos .
Poor kids are juggalos .
Everybody 's a ninja .
Your grandma could be a juggalo — you just do n't know it . "
Gonzales 's video earned him third place in the contest , and the same question over and over again : " What the hell is a juggalo ? "
" There are millions of different definitions , but I 'll give you the one I use most often , " he says .
" To a non-juggalo , a juggalo is just a fan of ICP or Psychopathic .
To a juggalo , it 's people who are accepting and supportive , people who look out for each other . "
That 's certainly how Primos got started .
Back in 1992 , eighteen - year - old Ernie Jones started working at a Texaco gas station on Alameda just off Sheridan .
His cousin Kiki Rodriguez , who lived out in Elbert County near Parker , was just eleven then , but he'd come into Denver to hang with Ernie and Ernie 's best friend , Flavio " Flava " Arellano — and steal candy from the 7 - Eleven next door .
" They were gangsters , and I was just kind of running wild with them guys , running around Denver when Larimer was crappy , spray - painting and acting the fool , " Kiki remembers .
" We were just a bunch of hood kids running around . "
Flava and Ernie were fans of a couple little - known rap artists in Detroit .
Instead of rhyming about women and money , Esham rapped about murder , suicide , drugs and mental illness .
The Inner City Posse made music that was equally dark — and had plenty of material for their album Dog Beats , since its members had also started an ill - fated gang of the same name that was no match for the established gangs of inner-city Detroit .
But Joe Bruce , better known as Violent J , and Joey Utsler , aka Shaggy 2 Dope , soon decided they wanted to try something more original .
And out of a dream about a dark carnival , the Insane Clown Posse was born .
In 1992 , the duo of insane clowns who painted their faces and rapped about killing the corrupt released their first album , Carnival of Carnage , on their own label , Psychopathic Records .
The company 's logo was the Hatchetman , a Mohawked character running with a hatchet that Shaggy 2 Dope had scribbled on a napkin .
The band 's followers — not that there were many outside of Detroit in the beginning — started calling themselves " juggalos . "
As Violent J explains it , he was at a show rapping " The Juggla " — a song about an actual carnival juggler — when he changed the word to " juggalo . "
The fans loved it , so he went with it .
By 1995 , when ICP 's third album , Riddle Box , came out , Flava was a full - fledged juggalo .
" It went from just being music to like a lifestyle kind of thing , " he remembers .
Being a juggalo was all - consuming .
ICP was not only what he listened to , it was all he listened to .
It influenced how he dressed , where he hung out , who he hung out with , what he drank .
Faygo — a cheap Detroit soda pop — became synonymous with ICP .
Juggalos made a mess with it at shows , spraying it everywhere .
It was the only non-alcoholic drink juggalos wanted .
As for alcoholic drinks , Flava and a few buddies found a nearby bar — Hollywood Legends , on Sixth Avenue — that was willing to play a couple of ICP songs on Wednesday and Friday nights .
Juggalos were soon coming out of the woodwork to hang out there .
In just a few weeks , it went from Flavio and three friends to thirty people showing up .
Kiki was the only juggalo at his Elbert high school .
In 1999 , after he graduated , he moved to Denver and got a little apartment with his girlfriend and his best friend , Ken Abrahamson .
Just after he turned eighteen , Kiki got caught selling drugs .
He was in jail when he found out his girlfriend was pregnant .
" I realized I needed to pull my shit together and man up , " he says .
By then , Ernie owned the Texaco franchise , and when Kiki got out of jail , he started working there part - time .
In 2001 , Shell bought Texaco , and Ernie got the chance to buy his gas station outright and turn it independent .
He and Kiki became partners and named their new business Primos — " cousins " in Spanish — and brought in Flava and Ken , their best friends from childhood .
Kiki soon had an idea for how to expand the business .
They 'd started ordering Faygo for the store , since it was hard to find in Denver and the juggalo partners liked to drink it themselves , but within a matter of weeks , juggalos from all over Denver , people they 'd never met , were showing up at Primos for Faygo .
" We got maybe fifty cases and started selling it , and it spiraled into , Jesus , we need like pallets of the stuff , " Kiki recalls .
Kiki knew enough about selling drugs to know he could move some Faygo .
" I called it liquid crack , " he says .
" If I can get it on the streets , get the kids doing it , I can make some money . "
But he needed money to make money .
He got it after 9/11 , when Ken took off to join the Army and started sending money back home — money for his mom , and for the business .
Kiki used it to buy a truckload of Faygo .
He started hustling his liquid crack to other stores .
At first no one wanted it ; they 'd never heard of Faygo .
But those willing to give it a try saw juggalo kids flooding their stores , buying twenty two - liters at a time .
" The store owners would call me up , like , ' These kids are crazy , ' and if they ran out of pop , they were like , ' These kids are breaking out my windows , they 're tearing up the store , they 're stealing , you gotta bring us some more pop , ' so luckily we had that on our side , " Kiki remembers .
" The kids would strong - arm them to bring more soda . "
His distribution system eventually grew to about forty pallets a month stocking 200 stores .
Meanwhile , Primos was becoming a juggalo hangout .
Kiki — always the businessman — realized that all these juggalos would buy merchandise .
But Psychopathic Records , ICP 's label that now represented a number of horror acts , sold its Hatchet Gear only at shows .
The Primos partners started harassing the label , juggalo style , to get permission to stock its products .
They 'd chase down artists and tour managers when they came through town for autograph signings , and at shows they'd hand out cards that said " We need Hatchet Gear " and have kids litter the stage with them .
When Anybody Killa , a rapper on the Psychopathic label , hit Denver for an autograph signing , they noticed that the tires on the merchandise trailer were hammered .
Flava and Ken , who was back from the Army , convinced the tour manager they needed new tires , and arranged for ABK to come to Primos after the signing .
They stayed at the shop , even slept there , waiting , but no one showed .
When they woke up , Ken and Flava decided to take the tires to Wyoming , where the ABK tour was headed .
They found the hotel and changed the trailer 's tires by hand .
For their efforts , Primos got a bunch of free , autographed merchandise — and a business card with the label 's fax number .
" They blew us off , took the tires and ran , and we still had no contract , " Kiki says .
So he started sending faxes — twenty pages three or four times a week — with pictures of Denver juggalos and lines like this : " This kid wants your clothes .
These kids are so sad they can't get your clothing . "
" I know they were pissed at us , " Kiki says .
When the partners heard that a store in Utah — the now - defunct Juggalo Homies — was selling Hatchet Gear , they took matters into their own hands .
Flava had to head that way for a funeral , so he took a couple thousand dollars and brought back as much merchandise as he could .
Primos was so small that they had to buy a plastic Tuff Shed to hold all the stuff .
" Dude , how ghetto was that ? "
Kiki laughs .
" But we sold it . "
And they worked out a deal with the Utah store to buy merchandise at a discount while they continued to pester Psychopathic .
But as it turned out , Psychopathic was n't hating on Primos .
It was just a small operation that had n't figured out how to wholesale its wares .
Nathan Extra , the label 's spokesman , remembers Kiki 's faxes .
" Obviously , we appreciate the love and persistence , but when we do n't have the answers ... it got pretty annoying , " he says .
And ICP was getting a lot of love from Denver .
According to Extra , Colorado is home to at least as many , if not more , juggalos than Michigan , and the Mile High is one of a very few cities where horror rap can fill a venue the size of Red Rocks .
That 's why on Saturday , the Hatchet Attacks !
show — featuring the entire Psychopathic Records label — is coming to Denver , and Denver alone .
And on Friday , Dark Lotus — a supergroup composed of the most popular Psychopathic acts , like ICP and Twiztid — will kick off a tour at a sold - out Gothic show .
Scum , whose latest album , Dinner 's Served , has a cover image of human intestines on a plate , is opening .
" It seems like the Dark Carnival is strong in Denver , " Extra says .
" Maybe it 's some sort of convergence point of the Dark Carnival 's energies .
Denver 's such a vast place , almost remote .
This is a place where you had something like Columbine happen .
It just proves there 's something underneath the surface going on .
Columbine is an example of how it can go bad .
Wicked shit is an example of how it can go good . "
ABK , the beneficiary of the tire change , has no doubt that Denver has the most juggalos of any city .
" It 's like the juggalo boys ' and girls ' club , " he says of Primos .
In 2004 , Primos finally got Psychopathic 's approval to buy its merchandise wholesale .
" We were first in Colorado , and like the second in the nation , which was a big deal in the juggalo world , " Kiki says .
Big enough that Primos quit selling gasoline and turned the store 's counter into a little display case .
To save money while they grew their business , Kiki and his wife and daughter were living with Ernie and his wife and kids .
Flava and Ken moved in , too .
In exchange for Faygo and cigarettes and a place to sleep , they worked at the store six days a week .
" What more does a person need ? " Flava asks .
" Any more than that 's greedy . "
Ernie was managing a run-down trailer park on East Colfax in Aurora .
The property had a faux Dutch windmill that seemed like the perfect spot for a second Primos , and they planned to have an autograph signing with some artists to celebrate the official opening once they got their permits .
" It was like that game , telephone , " Kiki remembers .
" By the time it got to the police department , we were going to have ICP there for a free concert and there was going to be a riot . "
The police came over , told the Primos partners that they would be responsible for any damage to the city — and that they needed to close their store " because out there juggalos are a gang , and someone with a known gang affiliation can't operate a business , " Kiki continues .
Although by now they had the required Aurora permits , the partners closed the second location a day after it opened and took its contents to the original Primos , where business was booming .
The Aurora Police Department has no record of that encounter , or of any other incidents with Primos — except for the time Flava and Ernie witnessed a burglary in one of the trailers and acted as witnesses .
According to Agent Bob Friel , his department does n't name gangs , and so wo n't comment on whether it considers juggalos a gang .
Other local jurisdictions , such as Arvada , Lakewood and Jefferson County , do not classify juggalos as an organized gang , though some crime — graffiti , in particular — has been connected to the group ( see story below ) .
" Nationally , this question is an ongoing issue in that there is kind of a continuum of involvement for persons who consider themselves to be juggalos , " explains Regina Huerter , executive director of the Denver Crime Prevention and Control Commission , who leads the Metro Denver Gang Coalition .
" At the extreme end is where you see violence and destruction , but there 's also many kids who consider themselves to be juggalos and are not involved in that .
They 're involved in the music and consider it a family . "
By the mid-2000s , Denver was home to a thriving underground horror - rap scene .
Brutally Vicious Killaz , or BVK , was born when Roy Lopez and Josh Barela met at Lincoln High School and found out they were both using the same rap name , X - plicit .
They came up with new names — V and Childish — and started rapping together .
Over the next few years , the two big , tough - looking guys hooked up with baby - faced Ben Casas , or Benzo , and the sweet - sounding Andrew Perez , Mister Twist .
They called their music " killa shit . "
It had a gangsta - rap style , with lyrics heavy on murder and horror themes , but much of it was meant to be light and funny , too .
They had their first show in Benzo 's back yard , on a stage they 'd built with a couple of crates and some plywood .
They invited the Primos partners , whom they considered friends from all the time they 'd spent hanging out at the shop , and the partners brought a few dozen juggalos .
" It was dumping rain ; it was horrible , " Kiki remembers .
But BVK kept at it , and Primos was soon hosting barbecues in the parking lot , where BVK would come to rap .
For the first one , in 2004 , they called up everybody on the " Ninja List " that kids could sign when they stopped in the store .
" Of course , they wrote , like , ' Serial Killer Scott ' or whatever , " Kiki says .
" So we'd be calling and talking to their moms , like , ' Is Serial Killer Scott there ? '
And she 's like , ' Who ? Scotty ? ' "
Two hundred kids showed up for the first barbecue , and the events just grew from there .
Bolstered by the turnout , when Kiki spotted an ad for a battle of the bands competition at Cervantes ' , he signed up BVK .
Bands were supposed to sell their own tickets , and because Primos sold the most for BVK — a hundred — the act got to headline .
" Of course , everybody else was playing instruments , " Kiki says .
" It was a rock thing .
BVK comes in , and they 're not small guys .
They 're huge , ginormous guys rapping on stage with no instruments .
It was such a bad combination .
They were so mad at us , but we had most of the crowd . "
The winner was supposed to be selected by acclamation , and BVK came in first — with cheers from their half of the fans and boos from the other half .
But after the emcee pointed out that boos would only help BVK generate more sound on the applause meter , the band fell out of first .
After the show , Kiki went to Jay Bianchi and told him he wanted to bring rap shows to Cervantes ' , since he'd shown that rap could pull a crowd .
Bianchi was a little leery , but ultimately agreed .
" I think they get a bad reputation because they 're all painted and all that stuff , " Bianchi says , " but basically they 're good kids , expressing themselves in their own little way . "
The Mile High Massacre in March 2005 was the first show Primos promoted at Cervantes ' , and the first gig for a new group Primos had been helping : Denver City Killaz .
Brothers Rob and Vince Smith and cousin Franky Sanchez — aka Rizz , V Espa and Graffix — had been part of the juggalo scene , hanging out at Primos since they were barely teens .
" I was raised by Primos and my mom — sadly , mainly Primos , " Franky says .
They were known as little gangsters who sold drugs and robbed fast - food restaurants under the name Suicidal Killaz , or the Red Army , and their reputations did n't hurt when they started making music .
For a Primos barbecue , Rob printed a sampler CD they 'd recorded in their grandparents ' basement to play over the shop 's P.A. system .
He 'd burned about sixty CDs and figured he might give away a couple .
But everyone wanted one , and the CDs were soon gone .
A few months later , Primos asked the Killaz to play the Mile High Massacre .
Rob remembers being backstage , nervous as hell , on his way to give the sound guy the CD .
" And we hear this big-ass ' DCK ! DCK !' all through the halls and shit , " he says .
The juggalos were a ready - and - waiting fan base , hungry for fresh blood , and they got all they could stomach from DCK and a creepy dude named Scum .
Scum , whose actual name is Ivan Ovchinnikov , came to Denver from Moscow when he was sixteen .
His mom had already moved to Colorado to work as a university scientist ; Ivan had the choice of staying in Moscow with his dad and being drafted into the military , or coming to America .
The already anti-establishment teen was n't about to risk his life for his country , so he left .
But adjusting to life here was n't easy .
" It sucked , it sucked horribly , " he says .
" I think a lot of negativity was built up over that time period while trying to learn English . "
While he was still in high school — bouncing from Manual to East to Overland when he'd get in trouble — he recorded songs with a group called Down Syndrome .
He used the word " fuck " excessively , not just because he liked it , but because he had a small vocabulary .
" What 's going to piss off the person that 's parked next to you in traffic when your windows are down and you 're playing it ?
Let 's talk about that , " he says .
" I love pissing people off .
I love getting dirty looks . "
At seventeen , Scum was living on his own when a kid named Sevill came knocking on his apartment door , looking for a joint .
He thought the kid with long hair who blasted death metal probably smoked .
" It turned out we were the same age , listened to the same type of stuff , " Scum says , citing the horror rap of Esham and ICP .
" He did n't really have no family , and I had very limited family ... no blood relatives in this country aside from my mother .
We were two troubled teens with no families and big dreams . "
They decided to form a rap duo .
" He made some crappy beats , I made some crappy raps , but we had fun , " says Scum , who quit going by Ivan about that time .
When no label showed much interest in their music — the content was a problem , but so was the fact that the music was n't that good , Scum admits — they started their own label , Lyrikal Snuff Productions , in 2001 .
Getting the CDs pressed was still a challenge , though , because no company wanted to print artwork like that of Enter the Asylum , a CD that has shots of Scum stabbing and slitting the throat of a naked woman .
Scum did n't cross paths with Primos until 2005 , when a friend gave Flava a copy of one of Scum 's CDs .
The Primos partners liked it , and invited Scum to sell his CDs and merchandise in their store .
But that was n't all :
They wanted to work with Scum , and not just because his dark music fit their genre .
He was clearly someone who knew that it took hard work to promote shows and was willing to do the work .
Scum had been building his fan base for years , playing mostly 21 - and - over shows at bars like Cricket on the Hill that would draw fifty people at most and piss off a lot of the venues ' regulars .
When Primos invited him to be part of the Mile High Massacre , it was Scum 's first all - ages show , and he quickly realized that he'd been missing a huge market .
The kids loved him .
Together , Scum and Primos took BVK and DCK on a six - state tour .
Most of the acts ' members had never been outside of Colorado , and it was like their first family vacation , even though they were sleeping in tents and showering at rest stops .
In 2006 , the scene got a big boost when a Denver act that Primos had been promoting , Axe Murder Boyz , won a Psychopathic contest and got a one - year contract .
( AMB is now back in Denver doing its own thing , because Primos and other local groups felt the rappers had abandoned them during their fifteen minutes . )
And they 've hosted three consecutive GoreFests at the Aztlan Theatre that attract horror - core ( or gore - hop , as Scum likes to call it ) artists and fans from around the country .
But they 've had setbacks , too .
Last summer , Sevill — Scum 's best friend and longtime business partner — died unexpectedly .
He 'd been working behind the scenes and backing the label financially from Indiana , where he'd moved .
His death was a huge blow to Scum , who went from putting on shows every few weeks to doing nothing for months .
When he finally got back to work , he and Primos organized a big November show at Cervantes ' , bringing in Anybody Killa as a headliner .
Cervantes ' was one of the few venues willing to book their kind of music , but it was an uneasy relationship .
Juggalos wear red , which makes them an obvious target for the Crips who hang out in Five Points , and some of them do n't shy away from starting a fight .
The Suicidal Killaz are the closest thing to an official juggalo gang .
Back in 2004 , when Franky was fifteen , two juggalo groups joined forces to become SK .
" Next thing you know , " he remembers , " we 're sixty soldiers deep , every one of us pushing drugs .
My specialty was robbing stores .
I gave the plans , told them what stores to hit . "
After Franky got caught and put on house arrest , he got into rapping .
" It was like we were forced out of all the shit we were doing , thank God , and we were kind of pushed more towards the music , " he says .
But as DCK was building a following , fans started saying they were SK — which also became the name of DCK 's label .
" People in my crew were running up on fans , like ' You ai n't Suicidal , ' " says Franky , who calls himself the leader of SK .
He had to get it in their heads that they were n't that kind of gang anymore .
Franky now refers to SK as an " organization . "
Kiki calls it a gang , while Flava — who used to be in a real west - side gang — says it 's not .
But Flava and Kiki agree that the SK fans can start trouble .
" When they get together , it 's a goddamn nightmare , just total mayhem , " Kiki says .
" They go psychotic .
It 's hard to control them . "
Especially outside Cervantes ' when a couple of Crips roll up .
" Juggalos are crazy , " Kiki says .
" One of them wo n't do much to you , but forty of them , they get the mob mentality .
There 's been many a show where there 's like four Crips and forty kids just beating the fuck out of these guys .
The owner of the club , he called us the Warriors .
It 's a 1970s movie about gangs , and there 's a group in there that paint their faces and run around with baseball bats .
That 's how we are , I guess . "
At the November show , a fight started between an SK kid who was out front smoking a cigarette and a couple of Crips .
When word of the fight trickled inside , Kiki , Flava , Ken and Scum ran out to try to stop it .
" We went out there to make peace , " Kiki says .
" We were saying , ' We understand it 's your neighborhood .
We do n't want any drama . '
They were n't having it .
They pulled their pistols out , like ' Fuck , no , you guys are leaving now . ' "
Ken got hit with a gun so hard his teeth went through his lip , and his eye is still black .
Flava had part of his ear torn off .
Shots were fired , and Scum landed on Kiki .
" I thought he did get shot , " Kiki says .
" He fell on top of me .
I dragged him into the club . "
Inside , people started screaming that Scum was shot , that he was dead .
Anybody Killa was still performing on stage when Cervantes ' owner turned the sound off and the lights on and told everybody they had to clear out .
Scum had been knocked out with a pistol , and he came to amid all the girls screaming and crying .
He was flattered , and also relieved that it was him and not a kid who'd gotten hurt .
Primos and Scum have n't put on a show there since .
" I 'd feel so bad if one of our fans was killed coming to watch our show over a color , " Kiki says .
" We 're out of that .
We 're not doing the gang thing .
We grew up .
It sucks we have to be forced to stop doing what we love because of that .
Cervantes ' was like our home . "
But they have a couple of other places they can still book .
Late last year , a show they put on at the Gothic brought in 600 people for a bill with Scum and local hip - hop group 5280 .
And on April 26 , the third GoreFest arrived at the Aztlan .
Aside from BVK , DCK and the out - of - staters , just about everybody who stepped onto the stage that day had been a fan of Scum 's , someone he'd helped get a start .
" That guy does nothing but work , work , work , " says fan - turned - hype- man Kyle " McFly " Swearengen .
" He stresses out to make sure everybody gets a chance . "
Scum talks in a deep , exaggerated voice with a faint trace of a Russian accent .
He always dresses in red and black , usually his own merchandise .
At shows , he and many of his fans wear theatrical contact lenses that they pick up at costume shops and flea markets , which make their eyes look gray and pupil - less , like zombies ' .
But despite his appearance and his lyrics , colleagues say Scum is one of the most polite , professional figures on the scene .
At the show , Scum kept a minute - by - minute schedule , introducing each twenty - minute set himself and rapping with half of them .
Minutes before DCK 's set was supposed to start , frontman Franky was sitting outside with the smokers .
A small circle of fans and friends had gathered around him , waiting to hear what he was going to say next .
Lanky and pale , he had a red contact in one eye and a blue one in the other , which made him look a little more bloodshot and crazy than he already does .
" I missed your last show , man , " one kid said .
" I never miss you , but I was in jail . "
" Yeah , I just got out , too , " said another fan .
" Man , I have n't been in jail since , " Franky paused to think .
" Not since the day after GoreFest last year . "
A tall security guard named Jamal asked Franky for a cigarette , and Franky made a proposition .
He wanted Jamal to kick everyone who was n't standing up by the stage or in the mosh pit out of their chairs , forcing them to the floor for his set .
" I want to fucking crowd - surf , " Franky explained .
Jamal said he could n't do it .
" I 'll give you forty bucks . "
Jamal smiled , nodded , and headed back inside .
Next to Franky , a kid named Iggy was examining his hand and groaning .
Someone had stepped on it when he fell in the mosh pit .
" I know you got pills , " Iggy said .
" Hook me up with some Vicodin . "
" Nah , " Franky replied .
" All I got is Oxy . "
" How much ? "
" Fifteen . "
Iggy did n't have enough cash , but the guys who just got out of jail were game .
" Hey , " Iggy said to Franky , like he was remembering something .
" Did you steal $ 100 from some kid last night ? "
" No , I robbed a guy for $ 1,200 , " Franky said , then told the story of how some dude he'd never met before had hit him up for two ounces of coke .
Franky took his money , gave him a fake phone as collateral , and calmly walked off with the cash , never to return .
" Yeah , well , this guy I know says you stole $ 100 from him .
Asked if I knew you .
Said he was going to kill you .
I told him good luck . "
Franky smiled and shrugged .
" DCK ! " he yelled .
" DCK ! " the smokers yelled back .
" SK ! "
" SK ! "
Inside , the audience was chanting " DCK ! DCK ! " as Jamal walked through the aisles , a flashlight in one hand , tapping people on the shoulder with the other : " You ca n't sit here right now .
You 've got to move . "
DCK attracted the biggest crowd of the night , and the fans chanted the musicians ' lyrics right back at Franky and Rob and Vince .
" Still on the street , " they rapped .
" Still selling drugs . "
Rob and Vince now live at their grandparents ' house in Centennial .
Their grandparents are supportive of what the boys are trying to do with their music , despite its content , and pass out Denver City Killaz products .
" We 're like ghetto - ass punks , ghetto - ass white kids , " Rob says .
" Just because we live where we live right now does n't mean we have n't seen some shit in our lives before .
Like right now , I got a case pending , I might do a year or two years in jail ....
It 's felony menacing , unlawful discharge of a firearm .
The shit that we rap about , it 's true .
It 's what 's going on . "
" I think that 's why people dig it so much , " Vince says .
" It 's from the heart .
We 're not putting on a front or putting on a show .
We do try to do it to the best of our abilities when we 're performing , but sometimes we 're a little too drunk or have taken a bit too many painkillers that night .
But they love it either way , man .
It 's a good feeling to know that people like our shit . "
" It definitely keeps us out of trouble , too , " Vince says .
" For the most part . "
" We 're not like gang members , " Rob says .
" I mean , we used to do some dumb shit back in the day , and then the music came and we 're like , no more . "
But while Franky likes to say that he 's given up the " gang shit " for a more " positive direction " — and his adult record is clean — he still deals drugs .
He tried to quit after his son was born six months ago , even got a full - time job , but he could n't pay the bills on $ 10 an hour and soon was back to dealing on the side .
Then he gave up the job so that he would n't miss out on big deals during the work week .
" I do handle most of the dirty business , " he says .
" I 'm not afraid to admit it , either .
This is America .
Do you really expect me to pay bills off a minimum - wage job ?
You 're living in a fucking fairy tale .
I got kids .
Fuck that .
I need fucking money .
" We were n't given that great a start and a whole lot of opportunity , but we know what we know , and we 're doing quite well for a bunch of kids with seventh - grade educations , " he continues .
" I want to take the people that I feel deserve something better and I want to fucking put them there .
I 'm trying to make something better .
I 'm going to do it either way , whether it 's legitimate or illegitimate . "
Kiki thinks that attitude is pretty emblematic of fans in the scene , especially the SK kids who look up to DCK .
" They all want to be legit , " he says .
" They want to do something , make their life better .
But it 's easy money compared to working every day .
They 'll call us up , be all proud , ' Hey , Primos , I got a job . '
A week later , ' That 's too much work .
They wanted me to work like eight hours , dude .
They would n't even let me smoke weed . '
" We try to give them somebody to look up to , like you can be who you are and still run a legitimate business .
Take all your energy you put into selling weed or selling dope or whatever , and do the same thing with selling your music , selling your T - shirts . "
As funny as it seems to them , the Primos partners have become role models .
With the store and the barbecues and the shows , they 're giving the juggalos something to do , something to keep them out of trouble .
The partners are a popular choice for shadowing on career days , and they give out free Faygo for good report cards , as well as for birthdays and for getting out of jail .
" I like to help these kids , keep them from making some of the mistakes I made when I was a kid , " Flava says .
" I sleep better at night knowing I 'm trying to help them , because they look up to us .
When we do deliveries , I can be stocking coolers and a juggalo will just come up and hug me from behind , tell me thanks for everything we do .
Joining the gang was a waste of time .
I found the respect and love and camaraderie ... there 's no words to describe how the juggalos make you feel when they just run up on you while you 're working and tell you how great you are . "
Flava and Kiki were sitting at a Denny 's recently when a guy they 'd never met walked by and shouted a little " woop woop " — the juggalo greeting call .
Shit like that happens all the time .
Kiki 's cell phone keeps beeping as he gets random texts from kids that say things like " Much clown love . "
Qrem Dela Qrem used to be Mike , one of the kids hanging around Primos .
He 'd drive down from Greeley to give Kiki some demos or stickers of the stuff he was working on as Qrem .
Kiki told Scum about him , and Scum let him on the first GoreFest bill .
Qrem looked like a jester , with his wild red hair and painted face , and the crowd took to him quickly , so Scum offered to let him record on the LSP label .
Mike 's a garbage man by day , with a fiancée and a daughter , but he feels like a celebrity .
He 's met fans with Q tattoos , sees his stickers everywhere , gets asked for autographs and has opened up for people he used to just listen to on his stereo .
It 's huge for a guy whose mentor and gym teacher told him he was lucky he did n't turn out to be a serial killer , given his history .
Mike 's father kidnapped him when he was five , and it took the cops six years to track him down .
When the police finally took him back to his mom , Mike hardly remembered her .
His father had started giving him alcohol and weed at seven , and he kept drinking and doing drugs and getting into trouble until his mom could n't handle it anymore .
He left home at sixteen .
After a series of arrests for DUI , theft , burglary and criminal mischief , Mike landed in a halfway house in Greeley .
" I seen dudes who were like fifty seeing their grandkids in there , " he remembers .
" I 'm like , I 'm glad I 'm nineteen now so I can get this shit over with .
After that was when I straightened up . "
Today he shares his story as a cautionary tale .
Occasionally , he 'll go buy a stack of Domino 's pizzas and put a bulletin on his MySpace page inviting kids to come over to his garage .
He calls them his friends , but they 're his fans .
" I can relate to a lot of these kids .
I got a friend , his mom was a meth addict and stuff when he was growing up and had him and his sister taken away , " Mike says .
" He 's been on his own since he got out of the foster home at seventeen .
And he 's like , ' Dude , it 's so hard . '
I 'm like , ' Yeah , that 's life . '
They do n't have anybody to tell them it 's going to be okay .
I was a bad kid , a real bad kid , so I know it 's not the way to go if you want to accomplish your shit .
If you want to come up , you got to get your shit straight .
I tell this to a lot of these kids . "
So does Scum .
" A lot of people in the scene are angry people , and they have two options , " he says .
" They can either go out and shoot people or pick up the mike and shoot people in their songs .
When I get frustrated and want to walk into my job and start unloading on them , I go to the studio , record a couple of tracks about going to my job and unloading on them , and I feel better .
It 's a release .
Same with the mosh pit .
We do n't have a very happy crowd .
We have a great crowd , they 're die - hard .
But they do n't come from happy homes .
We do n't have many rich kids in our scene .
A lot of them are broke .
A lot of them are homeless .
A lot of them are hungry .
A lot of them are facing jail time .
On probation .
They 're going through hard times , and they need angry music to relieve the stress . "
And they need family .
" They say you can't pick your family , but I think you can , " Flava says .
" Everything we do is about loyalty and family .
People can downplay everything we do and say we 're never going to make it big , and we might not ... "
" We already have , in our own way , " Kiki says .
In the past year , the Primos partners have gone from promoting rap groups to becoming their own rap group .
They build elaborate stage sets , like cemeteries and hangman 's nooses , have friends dress up like zombies on stage , and bring in lights and fog .
BVK helps with the beats , and kids already know the words to their songs .
Flava stays away from the microphone , but he gets to star in another Primos venture : Primos Hardcore Wrestling .
The partners did n't set out to create their own version of Juggalo Championship Wrestling ; they just wanted to organize matches with already established wrestling clubs in Denver .
But fans of those clubs did n't take to the juggalo heckling , profanity and gimmicks .
So they started booking matches in the back room of the Buffalo Rose in Golden .
At juggalo wrestling , the heroes — including Flava , who goes by the name that Franky gave him , Big Stress — are face - painted clowns , a killer in a Jason mask , and a massive ogre of a man playing the bogeyman .
The villains are skinny rednecks in jean shorts and cowboy hats , like " Brokeback Billy . "
Props include everything from Twinkies to a toilet seat .
And little kids who 've come to watch with their families scream things like " You can do it , bogey !
Kick his ass !
You stupid hillbilly ! " while the ICP song " Chicken Huntin ' , " which is about killing rednecks , plays overhead .
And in the end , when the juggalos are inevitably victorious , the chanting is instantaneous .
" Fam — il — y ! "
" Fam — il — y ! "
Near the end of the ten - hour GoreFest , Scum finally took the stage for his own set .
" You motherfuckers ready for some sick shit ? " he yelled .
Some captured alive , and though none will survive , I strive for my meats to stay juicy .
So slice after slice I dissect them like mice , their wounds stuffed with tampons like pussy .
Alive they 'll remain , going insane from the pain , that 's why some would call me sadistic .
Do n't fuck them ' cause it 's rude , to be puttin ' a dick up in your food , my urges are straight cannibalistic .
Increased murder rate , when I come to your state , that must be the fate
You deserved
Do n't cry , it 's too late , when your guts on a plate are about to get ate .
Dinner 's served !
Bloody body on a meat hook , bloody body in the fridge , bloody body in the river , floating underneath the bridge .
' Cause that body got to rotting , reeking like a roadkill skunk , those that decompose disposed of , no one likes dead body funk .
Got to eat them freshly murdered , got to eat them while they fresh , love the taste of bloody tender , gooey , chewy , human flesh .
After all the rhymes about dead bodies , crushed bones and cannibalism , Scum said he wanted to dedicate the show to his fallen brother , Sevill .
As he rapped " The Good Die Young , " which he wrote for him , kids stopped moshing and pulled out their lighters .
They stood still , with flames raised , through the entire song .
Then Scum introduced his " personal mentor , " Insane Poetry , a group out of L.A .
Although this was the night 's headliner , a lot of the kids started clearing out ; they 'd come to see Scum .
So Scum jumped to the floor and restarted the mosh pit to keep the crowd .
When Scum finally returned to the stage , Insane Poetry 's Cyco said he had a surprise .
It was Scum 's birthday , and his friends were going to say a few words .
Qrem came up and said that Scum was his mentor , his engineer , that he owes it all to him .
McFly said that he started out as a fan and Scum took him in as a brother .
Flava — who has tattoos across his neck that read " SK , I miss your mommy , " for Franky 's mom , and " LSP , I miss your brother , " for Sevill — said they 'd been through a lot together , made a lot of mistakes together , but had come through as family .
A blushing Scum thanked them all .
" All of you who stayed the whole fucking night , you 're the ones that keep the scene alive , " he said .
" If we keep up , we 're going to take over Colorado . "
This is a kind of political non-endorsement .
And we 're publishing it for all four of our readers in Oklahoma .
Or maybe there 's more .
It 's hard to tell some days .
Rep . Dan Boren is a Democrat ( yes , there are a few in that state ) .
In fact , he 's the lone and loneliest Democrat in the state 's congressional delegation .
He represents a heavily rural district in eastern Oklahoma .
So today the Democratic House member announced that he will not be endorsing Sen. Barack Obama for president .
He did say he would vote for Obama at the Democratic National Convention and he would vote for him on Nov. 4 .
But he 's not publicly for him by endorsing him , you understand .
How 's that for splitting political hairs for the sake of your own third term ?
Boren is one of those questionable Oklahomans who actually went to Texas for his college education ( Texas Christian ) , but he did salvage his reputation by returning to his father 's university for his MBA .
Boren 's grandfather , Lyle , represented southeastern Oklahoma in the House for 10 years back in the FDR era .
Calling himself a centrist and Obama " the most liberal senator , " Dan Boren told the Associated Press today he 's bound to represent the wishes of his district 's voters , who went 2 - to - 1 for Sen .
Hillary Clinton in the state 's February primary .
He said that while Obama claimed to work in a bipartisan fashion , he does n't really .
Rep .
Boren 's father , David , is the former Oklahoma governor , senator and presently president of the University of Oklahoma , who has endorsed Obama .
Which one do you think will get asked to those White House dinners ?

LONDON , April 18 , 2008  -- Commuters in London and its neighboring towns and villages in southern England woke up to an unusual smell Friday morning : a stink that led many to wonder if the city 's sewers had overflowed .
Not even the queen was spared , as newspapers reported that Windsor Castle also suffered from the effects of the putrid smell .
The U.K. Meteorological Office ( Met Office ) was quick to assure callers that there was no reason to panic .
The foul smell was not English , Sarah Holland , a forecaster for the Met Office told the BBC .
" The origins of the smell come from Europe , " she said .
Blame
It on the French ?
Nice Try
British tabloid , The Daily Mail was quick to attack the French for " le stink , " reporting that " freak weather " had caused the " French stench " to come to England .
But , according to Helen Chivers , a forecaster at the Met Office , the smell actually came across " from Northern Europe . "
" The weather situation recently has meant that the air over Germany , Belgium and Holland has n't moved for a while , " Chivers explained in an interview with ABC News .
" One does n't know whether the origins of the smell are industrial or agricultural , but we think it 's built up over time , since it was trapped in the atmosphere for a while .
That 's why it 's so intense , " she said .
But she insisted there was no reason to panic .
" This sort of thing happens from time to time .
It 's not so uncommon .
There is no health hazard to worry about , " she said .
Despite the pungency of the smell , a London Fire Brigade spokesman confirmed to ABC News Friday that the brigade had " not received any calls about it today . "
For the time being , Chivers said that " the weather situation will likely stay the same over the weekend . "
Londoners need not worry too much :
The one thing that might help dissipate the smell is rainfall , hardly a rarity in London .
" The smell will probably ease up somewhat because of the expected rainfall over the weekend , " Chivers said .
And if for some reason Londoners have a sunny , rainfree weekend , trans - Atlantic winds next week will help shift the foul fumes out of southern England , according to Chivers .
" The Atlantic air should clear it out by the middle of next week , " she said .
PORTLAND , Oregon ( Reuters ) - Washington and Oregon can start killing sea lions that feed on migrating salmon to help preserve dwindling U.S. Pacific Northwest salmon populations , a federal agency said on Tuesday .

The National Marine Fisheries Service granted permission to the states to target as many as 85 sea lions a year near the Bonneville Dam on the Columbia River .
Oregon ’s Department of Fish and Wildlife said removal will start after April 1 .
Salmon - gobbling pinnipeds have been a problem in West Coast waters for over a decade and at Bonneville Dam for about five years .
About 100 California sea lions make the 150 - mile ( 240 - km ) trip upriver to feast on spawning salmon channeling into the dam ’s fish ladders , according to Oregon .
Authorities have tried to deter the sea lions by installing physical barriers and driving them off with rubber bullets , firecrackers and other noise - makers with little success .
Only sea lions seen gobbling salmon during between January 1 and May 31 can be killed , according to the order .
Before sea lions are killed , they must be trapped and held for 48 hours while fisheries managers try to find them a home at a zoo or aquarium .
There is a provision , however , that allows sea lions to be shot in the water if the animals are not easily captured .
The decision raised the ire of one animal protection group .
“ This is a waste of money , time and lives and diverts attention from the real problems the fish face , ” Sharon Young , marine issues field director for The Humane Society of the United States said .
The HSUS supports “ non-lethal harassment ” of sea lions at Bonneville Dam .
The decision comes just in time for the peak of the spring salmon run in April and May .
Washington , Oregon and Idaho were required to ask permission because the sea lions are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act .
A male sea lion , which can reach 1,000 pounds ( 454 kg ) , consumes about 30 pounds ( 13.6 kg ) or five to seven fish a day .
The National Marine Fisheries Service estimates that the sea lions ate nearly 4,000 salmon last year , which accounted for about 5 percent of the spring salmon run .
About one - third of the salmon eaten are endangered , according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .
State and federal governments have spent billions trying to protect the once abundant fish and fishery managers have also proposed a virtual shutdown of salmon fishing this year in California and Oregon coastal waters .

PHOENIX -- Democrats already are regularly attacking John McCain for offering what they characterize as a third George W. Bush term .
But a new Theodore Roosevelt presidency might be closer to the mark .
McCain , the four - term Republican senator from Arizona and presumptive GOP presidential nominee , is promising an administration that reflects " conservative principles , values and vision . "
He also says his administration would have a powerful environmental bent , in the Roosevelt tradition .
At this early stage , the names and faces that would flesh out a McCain White House remain pure speculation .
After all , McCain insists he has n't started seriously thinking about a running mate yet .
And there 's still a general election to win against a yet - to - be- determined Democratic opponent .
But political experts and analysts already are contemplating what a McCain Cabinet might look like .
Some common guesses include well - known McCain allies and even past rivals in key positions :
• Sen. Joe Lieberman , I - Conn. , in a prominent job , possibly even secretary of state .
• Former Sen. Fred Thompson , R - Tenn. , as attorney general .
• Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani as homeland security secretary .
• Former Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas as treasury secretary .
• Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee as health and human services secretary .
For his part , McCain last week said he'd be looking for Cabinet members who " just share my conservative philosophy and views : less government , less regulation , lower taxes . "
But he also volunteered that conservationism would be a priority , saying he would hope " to preserve the great natural treasures of the West and our state and do whatever we can to protect our environment . "
" I return to kind of the Teddy Roosevelt outlook toward things , " McCain said .
McCain has long identified Roosevelt , president from 1901 to 1909 , as a political idol .
Roosevelt made national parks and nature preserves a priority , and McCain has drawn fire from conservative Republicans for opposing oil exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and for sponsoring legislation to address climate change .
McCain would tap business titans
McCain has dropped other hints about his Cabinet along the campaign trail .
Over the past year , he often has talked about approaching U.S. business leaders to serve their country by taking on federal - government responsibilities .
He specifically has mentioned Fred Smith of FedEx , John Chambers of Cisco Systems , Steve Ballmer of Microsoft and billionaire investor Warren Buffett as possible Cabinet members .
Bureaucracies such as the hapless Federal Emergency Management Agency , whose limitations were exposed in 2005 by Hurricane Katrina , could use a dose of private - sector ingenuity and know - how , McCain has said .
" I would go out to the smartest and best people in America , no matter what their party affiliation , " McCain said last year at a town - hall meeting in Gilford , N.H .
" There are some very successful people in this country who have done a great deal and become very rich while doing it .
And I 'm going to those people — the John Chambers and the Steve Ballmers and the Warren Buffetts and all those people — and say , ' Look ... you 've done very well in this country .
Now give back something to your country . ' "
Like Roosevelt , McCain shares reformer tendencies and aims to sic his best and brightest appointees on , among other things , the Defense Department , where he sees rampant waste and inefficiency in its acquisition process .
A Pentagon focus
Some observers said they could possibly see McCain keeping on Defense Secretary Robert Gates , who has been in the job for only a little more than a year .
McCain and Gates generally are in alignment on the Iraq war , a major emphasis of McCain's .
But McCain , a former Navy pilot with years of national security experience , is expected to exude heavy influence on the Pentagon regardless of who holds the post .
" Like ( former President Dwight ) Eisenhower , McCain would probably be his own secretary of defense , " said John J. " Jack " Pitney Jr. , who teaches politics and government at Claremont McKenna College in California .
McCain also has vowed to immediately shutter the Guantanamo Bay detention camp and has clashed with the Bush White House over the treatment of suspected terrorists .
That means any Justice Department and Defense Department officials who justified the use of what McCain considers torture are sure to be dispatched in his administration .
" I would n't see a big shakeup at the Pentagon , but I would expect that most of the political appointees would be gone as a matter of course , but especially if they 'd been involved in the decisions about torture , " said James Pfiffner , a presidency scholar and professor of public policy at George Mason University in northern Virginia .
Bush staffers would leave
In general , few observers expect McCain to keep many , if any , Bush administration figures .
Even if Bush did n't continue to poll poorly , new presidents traditionally clean house .
" He 's going to want his own people in there , " Pitney said of McCain .
" During the campaign , he 'll probably want to emphasize that his administration would be a new beginning .
I think he realizes that a lot of Bush holdovers would get him off to a bad start in public opinion . "
Sen. Jon Kyl , R - Ariz. , a McCain supporter , predicted wholesale turnover regardless of McCain 's feelings about the current Cabinet .
" Very few people in a political position expect to stay into the next administration — virtually none , " Kyl said .
" If John McCain comes in and says , ' Gee , I 'd like to have you stay , ' maybe somebody would be willing to stay , but the expectation is that the job ends at the end of this year . "
IRAQ WAR COSTS CENSORED
Pentagon removes $ 3 trillion price tag for war from web site after exposure By Ralph Forbes
The cost of direct U.S. military operations in Iraq — not including long - term costs such as taking care of wounded veterans — already exceeds the cost of the 12 - year war in Vietnam and is more than double the cost of the Korean War .
These costs are projected to be almost 10 times the cost of the first Gulf War , almost a third more than the cost of the Vietnam War , and twice that of World War I .
The only war in U.S. history that cost more was the World War II , when 16.3 million U.S. troops fought in a campaign lasting four years , at a total cost ( in 2007 dollars , after adjusting for inflation ) of about $ 5 trillion .
With virtually the entire armed forces committed to fighting the Germans and Japanese , the cost per GI ( in today ’s dollars ) was less than $ 100,000 .
By contrast , the Iraq war is costing upward of $ 400,000 per soldier .
America is spending $ 16 billion a month on running costs alone .
Running expenses for 2008 are projected to exceed $ 12.5 billion a month for Iraq alone , up from $ 4.4 billion in 2003 .
A contractor working as a security guard gets about $ 400,000 a year , more than 10 times what the government spends on a soldier .
To save money , if a soldier is injured , he is forced to repay his sign - up bonus .
One soldier was sued for $ 12,000 for loss of his helmet and equipment even though he had suffered massive brain damage in an attack .
The Pentagon keeps two sets of books .
The first is the official casualty list posted on the DoD website .
The second , hard - to - find set of data is available only on a different website and can be obtained under the Freedom of Information Act .
This data shows that the total number of soldiers who have been wounded , injured , or suffered from disease is double the number wounded in combat .
New research by the Stiglitz / Bilmes team shows that the majority of these injuries and illnesses can be tied directly to service in the war .
After Linda Bilmes published a paper on the cost to veterans , the then - assistant secretary for Health at the Pentagon phoned her and her dean and demanded , “ Where did you get these numbers ? ”
Bilmes said , “ I got them from your website , which we now have access to . ”
He said , “ Oh , that ca n’t be . ”
Bilmes said , “ Well , look at your website . ”
He said , “ Well , fax me my own website . ”
So she faxed him his website .
Then they took down those websites .
Then they directed the Department of Veterans Affairs to change the Veterans ’ websites .
This trickery is seen in the president ’s proposal for the FY09 budget for veterans .
Ostensibly the budget is being increased by $ 5 billion , But if you look at the fine print , they ’re hoping to recoup over $ 3 billion by increasing the co-pays and all the fees on the veterans who need to use the services .
While shafting the soldiers , the administration insists on “ sole - source bidding , ” awarding vast , multi- year contracts to Halliburton , et al. , instead of putting them out for bids .
“ An academic might say , ‘ How can you be a free market , yet demand single source contracting ? ’ ” asks Joseph E. Stiglitz , co-author of The Trillion Dollar War : The True Cost of the Iraq Conflict .*

Nano - whatever is all the rage .
They 're a big deal because they can make a blacker version of black and lots of other things but what does that even mean ?
Richard Compton and his team at Oxford University are here to help make carbon nanotubes understandable to everyone - namely , by making it relevant to food .
They have developed a sensitivity technique to measure the levels of capsaicinoids , the substances that make chilis hot , in samples of hot sauce .
They report their findings in The Analyst .
The current industry procedure is to use a panel of taste - testers , which is highly subjective .
Compton ’s new method unambiguously determines the precise amount of capsaicinoids and is not only quicker and cheaper than taste - testers but more reliable for purposes of food standards ; tests could be rapidly carried out on the production line .
Our friends at LiveScience sent over these promotional hot sauces .
Now we can use carbon nanotubes to test that Space.com one .
They tested a range of chili sauces , from the mild “ Tabasco Green Pepper ” sauce to “ Mad Dog ’s Revenge ” , which sports an extensive health warning and liability disclaimer .
The well - established Scoville method – currently the industry standard – involves diluting a sample until five trained taste testers cannot detect any heat from the chilli .
The number of dilutions is called the Scoville rating ; the relatively mild Jalapeño ranges from around 2500 - 8000 , whereas the hottest chilli in the world , the “ Naga Jolokia ” , has a rating of 1000000 .
High performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) can also be used , but this requires bulky , expensive equipment and detailed analysis of the capsaicinoids .
In Compton ’s method , the capsaicinoids are adsorbed onto multi-walled carbon nanotube ( MWCNT ) electrodes .
The team measures the current change as the capsaicinoids are oxidised by an electrochemical reaction , and this reading can be translated into Scoville units .
The technique is called adsorptive stripping voltammetry ( ASV ) , and is a relatively simple electrochemical method .
Compton says , “ ASV is a fantastic detection technique for capsaicinoids because it ’s so simple - it integrates over all of the heat creating constituents because all of the capsaicinoids have essentially the same electrochemical response . ”
Compton has applied for a patent on the technology , and Oxford University ’s technology transfer subsidiary ISIS Innovation is actively seeking backers to commercialise the technique .

Stick an asparagus plant in a pot full of Martian soil , and the asparagus might grow happily , scientists announced Thursday .
An experiment on the Phoenix Mars lander showed the dirt on the planet ’s northern arctic plains to be alkaline , though not strongly alkaline , and full of the mineral nutrients that a plant would need .
“ We basically have found what appears to be the requirements , the nutrients , to support life whether past , present or future , ” said Samuel P. Kounaves of Tufts University , who is leading the chemical analysis , during a telephone news conference on Thursday .
“ The sort of soil you have there is the type of soil you ’d probably have in your backyard . ”
Mars today is cold and dry , and the surface is bombarded by ultraviolet radiation , making life unlikely , but conditions could have made the planet more habitable in the past .
Plants that like alkaline soil  like asparagus  might readily grow in the Martian soil , provided that other components of an Earth - like environment including air and water were also present .

GRANTHAM , Pennsylvania ( Reuters ) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton defended her support for abortion rights at a faith forum on Sunday , saying the decision to have an abortion was not just about the “ potential life ” of a child , but the lives of others involved , including the parents .

Clinton and her rival for the Democratic presidential nomination , Barack Obama , attended the event sponsored by Faith in Public Life , a nonpartisan resource center .
The Democratic candidates were courting religious activists from across the political spectrum -- a group with clout in U.S. politics .
Abortion is one of the most divisive issues in American politics and many of the evangelical Christian leaders and others in the audience were opposed to abortion rights for religious reasons .
Clinton was pointedly asked during the nationally broadcast forum if she believed life “ begins at conception . ”
“ I believe that the potential for life begins at conception ... but for me , it is not only about the potential life , but the other lives involved , ” Clinton said , noting her Methodist faith and the denomination ’s own struggle with the issue .
She also reiterated her belief that while abortion should remain legal , it should also be safe and rare .
“ Individuals must be entrusted to make this profound decision because the alternative would be such an intrusion of government authority that it would be very difficult to sustain in our open society , ” she said at the forum held on the campus of Messiah College near Harrisburg , Pennsylvania .
Obama , whose time on the show followed Clinton ’s , said “ adoption is an option , ” but stressed that he remained committed to the support of abortion rights .
Also asked if he thought life began at conception , Obama said : “ This is something that I have not , I think , come to a firm resolution on .
... I do n’t presume to know the answer to that question . ”
The candidates were also asked questions about issues including poverty , human rights and climate change -- issues which have been embraced by the powerful U.S. evangelical movement as it broadens its agenda beyond hot button social issues such as opposition to abortion rights and gay marriage .
“ We are going to put in place a cap - and - trade system that controls the amount of greenhouse gases that are going into the atmosphere .
... I think religion can actually bolster our desire to make those sacrifices now , ” Obama said .
Clinton evoked Christ to explain her concern for the poor .
” ...
The incredible demands ... that Christ called us to respond to on behalf of the poor are unavoidable , ” she said .

The forum was held about a week before Pennsylvania ’s Democratic primary election , which the Obama camp hopes will clinch the hard - fought contest to pick the party ’s candidate to run in November ’s presidential election .
Presumptive Republican presidential nominee John McCain declined an invitation to the forum , raising eyebrows in the evangelical community .
McCain ’s Republican Party has been much more closely associated with the “ faith vote , ” especially evangelicals .
In the 2004 election President George W. Bush got close to 80 percent of the support from white evangelical Protestants who cast ballots in that year ’s White House election .
But McCain has been uncomfortable talking about his faith -- in marked contrast to Clinton and Obama -- and many conservative Christians have not warmed to him because of his support for stem cell research and other political heresays .
“ It ’s a missed opportunity for him ( McCain ) .
You do n’t get opportunities like this very often and anywhere from 25 to 40 percent of the evangelical vote is up for grabs this year , ” said Richard Cizik , vice president for governmental affair at the National Association of Evangelicals .
“ This vote is up for grabs for a number of reasons , including the broadening of the evangelical agenda , ” he told Reuters on Sunday ahead of the forum .
Planning a trip to China ?
Then your holiday has just become even more expensive .
The Chinese Embassy in the UK this week effectively more than doubled the cost of a tourist visa - a move that will hit Brits planning to head out there for the Beijing Olympics in August , as well as thousands of other holidaymakers and gap - year travellers .
The new higher fees have also coincided with a tightening of the rules which make applying for a visa " much more complicated , " according to one holiday expert .
As a result , it is likely that more people will make use of their tour operator 's paid - for visa application service .
In all , a family of four now faces shelling out as much as £ 400 .
The cost of a standard " single entry " visa remains unchanged at £ 30 per person .
But now there is an " application service fee " to pay , too .
This is £ 35.25 per person - or £ 47 if you want an " express service " .
Meanwhile , travel companies typically charge around £ 25 - £ 50 per person for holding people 's hands through the process ( providing advice , checking people 's applications etc ) .
The new fees have come about because the Chinese Embassy has decided to outsource some of the administrative work associated with issuing visas .
On Thursday , a " Chinese Visa Application Service Centre " ( CVASC ) opened for business near London 's Chancery Lane .
Ordinary visa applications will have to be submitted to the CVASC .
There will be a transition period during which time the embassy will allow people to pre-book appointments via the internet , though the early word on this system was that getting an appointment was proving easier said than done .
The higher costs came as a shock to Siobhan Hawthorne who is planning a visit to China to see friends .
Hawthorne , who lives in Walthamstow , east London , says that as a family of four , they are likely to pay around £ 380 in total .
" It just adds enormously to the cost - it will eat into our budget .
And it seems like it has become a more complicated process , " she says , adding that as a result , they will be making use of their tour operator 's service in an attempt to make sure it all goes as smoothly as possible .
You used to be able to turn up at the Chinese Embassy in London 's Portland Place and queue up to get a visa .
But as demand has grown , so have the long lines of people .
Last year the embassy processed 180,000 applications .
" This is a huge amount , " says an embassy spokesman .
" All those applying have to stand in a long queue .
That is the agonising fact for many applicants . "
As a result , many people were not satisfied with the service , and it was getting too crowded in the visa office , he adds .
However , the holiday expert Guardian Money spoke to says the change might also have something to do with the well - heeled residents of the Portland Place area being less than happy about the hordes on their doorstep .
As to who is behind the CVASC , the expert says : " They say they are nothing to do with the embassy . "
What also seems clear is that the rules on visas have been tightened .
When applying , you have to provide details of your outward and return flights .
If staying in a hotel , you must provide details of the booking - including , it is claimed , the dates you will be there , the address and the phone and fax number .
If you are staying with friends or relatives , you must provide an " invitation letter " from them , including their address , and a copy of their ID card if they are a Chinese citizen , or a work permit if they are foreign .
The holiday expert said that the increased costs and bureaucracy will probably make some would - be holidaymakers think twice about visiting China .
A report in the New York Times earlier this week claimed that while analysts had forecast the Games would bring 500,000 foreign visitors , and billions of dollars of extra revenue to Beijing this summer , some economists were beginning to doubt that the city would get the kind of economic windfall it was hoping for .
" Many hotels in Beijing are struggling to find guests , some large travel agencies have temporarily closed branches , and people scheduled to travel here for seminars and conferences are cancelling , " it stated .
But when it comes to the higher fees , perhaps us Brits are simply getting a taste of our own medicine .
The embassy spokesman says his understanding is that any Chinese applying for a UK visa has to deal with a visa centre affiliated to the British Embassy in Beijing .
" The new system in place in London now is more or less the same format , " he adds .
He also indicates that the new fees compare favourably with the charges imposed on Chinese people coming to Britain .
He 's right : a quick bit of number - crunching on the web reveals that a standard visa to the UK costs the equivalent of about £ 70 .

Webgrind : A Web Frontend for Xdebug
28th April , 2008
My about page has mentioned a web based frontend for Xdebug for some time .
The project has a name now :
The idea for Webgrind , a spin on Valgrind , came from lack of profiling tools for PHP , particularly on OSX .
Though it is possible to install kcachegrind on osx it seems overkill for many uses and is definitely not as easy as unzipping a folder to the webroot .
After sitting on the idea for some time , I spoke with Jacob Oettinger about it and he promptly started on the foundation .
What we have done up to this point is far from the power of kcachegrind , but it does allow for simple profiling in the browser to locate methods and functions most in need of optimization .
Plus it installs in seconds .
I have since learned that the PHP group has a suggestion for a Google Summer of Code project that replicates the features of KCacheGrind as a web frontend .
It seems Chung - Yang Lee has signed up for the challenge and it will be interesting to follow his progress .
We are currently making the last changes before releasing the first version on our Google code page for Webgrind .
Please let us know what you think of this and of any ideas for future features .
A downloadable package will be ready on Wednesday .

Ralph Nader made some controversial comments regarding Barack Obama to the Rocky Mountain News .
Nader alleged that only Obama ’s race makes him different from any of the recent Democratic presidential candidates .
He also said that Obama is talking white to appear to be a less threatening African - American politician , but is it possible that there is some truth in Nader ’s comments ?
“ There ’s only one thing different about Barack Obama when it comes to being a Democratic presidential candidate .
He ’s half African - American .
Whether that will make any difference , I do n’t know .
I have n’t heard him have a strong crackdown on economic exploitation in the ghettos .
Payday loans , predatory lending , asbestos , lead .
What ’s keeping him from doing that ?
Is it because he wants to talk white ?
He does n’t want to appear like Jesse Jackson ?
We ’ll see all that play out in the next few months and if he gets elected afterwards , ” Nader said .
There is a degree of truth in Nader ’s observation .
The Obama campaign knows that the one thing that could cost him the election is if he appears to be the “ radical black candidate . ”
Notice how as the primary campaign went along , less was made of Obama the community organizer , also notice how Obama does very few public appearances with black political leaders .
The campaign does n’t want Obama lumped in with the perceived more extreme Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton .

The out of touch part of Nader ’s comments come with his reasoning for why Obama is “ talking white , ” “ He wants to show that he is not a threatening , a political threatening , another politically - threatening African - American politician .
He wants to appeal to white guilt .
You appeal to white guilt not by coming on as a black is beautiful , black is powerful .
Basically he ’s coming on as someone who is not going to threaten the white power structure , whether it ’s corporate or whether it ’s simply oligarchic .
And they love it .
Whites just eat it up . ”
The reality is that the political parties are controlled by white people , but I do n’t think Obama is talking white to try to appease white fears about him .
I think the leadership in both parties only care about picking a candidate that can win .
They do n’t care about race .
People who like Nader who remember the civil rights struggles of the 1950s and 1960s tend to view race relations within that prism .
We saw similar comments from the Clintons during the primary campaign .
I think Nader ’s talking white comment demonstrates how out of touch his view of the issue of race is .
There has been progress on the issue over the past 40 years .
Most importantly most Americans do n’t view race the same way that they did back then .
Nader ’s comments represent an outdated view of race in this country .
Racism still exists in the United States , but the Obama campaign should be viewed in the context of 2008 , not 1958 .

You say the experience of traveling by air just keeps getting worse and worse ?
You 're not alone .
A new report being released this morning confirms what most of you business travelers already know :
The airlines are losing their battle against deteriorating service ... losing badly .
From Associated Press :
The industry posted declines last year in every area of the Airline Quality Rating , amid rising fuel prices , safety problems and bankruptcy filings that shut down three carriers last week alone .
The biggest change was in the rate of consumer complaints , up 60 percent overall .
The rate more than doubled at US Airways and Comair , and rose for 15 of the 16 airlines included in the study .
The exception was Mesa Airlines .
On - time arrivals dropped for the fifth straight year , with more than one - quarter of all flights late , according to the survey .
The rates of passengers bumped from overbooked flights and bags lost , stolen or damaged also jumped in 2007 .
At least some of the airlines are showing remarkable consistentcy : Frontier , Northwest , SkyWest , Southwest , United and US Airways all logged declines in every survey category .
More details are to be released at press conference later this morning .
The business model appears irrevocably broken , government has shown itself powerless to help -- or worse -- and , technology can only do so much .
So here 's a question if you 're headed off somewhere this morning :
Have you considered the train ?
Nothing , however , compares to the horror and humiliation of appearing in a videogame .
Beauty is destroyed in a vomit of sprites and mutated textures .
Talent is lost in the wasteland of two dimensions or the soulless , robotic modeling of three .
Everything fans love and recognize is warped , stretched , melted , bloated ... and then paraded on the screen for dozens of hours at a time .
Luckily , what 's rarely flattering for the stars is always hilarious for us .

Oh wait ... that 's supposed to be Jessica Alba too ?

We knew Bruce Willis was old and bald , but we had no idea he was also an extreme burn victim whose liquefied face threatened to drip off his skull at any moment .
Can someone please get the poor guy a bucket before he accidentally forms an expression ?
To be fair , this screen grab was taken from a PS1 game .
On the other hand , the PS1 game in question - Apocalypse - built most of its marketing campaign around the claim that Bruce Willis had been flawlessly recreated as its digital protagonist .
We pray , for the actor 's sake , they failed .

Editor ’s note : Frank von Hippel has written a response to this column in the comments below .
Click here to read his rebuttal .
I am a former U.N. weapons inspector .
I started my work with the United Nations in September 1991 , and between that date and my resignation in August 1998 , I participated in over 30 inspections , 14 as chief inspector .
The United Nations Special Commission , or UNSCOM , was the organization mandated by the Security Council with the implementation of its resolutions requiring Iraq to be disarmed of its weapons - of - mass - destruction capabilities .
While UNSCOM oversaw the areas of chemical and biological weapons , and ballistic missiles , it shared the nuclear file with the International Atomic Energy Agency , or IAEA .
As such , UNSCOM , through a small cell of nuclear experts on loan from the various national weapons laboratories , would coordinate with the nuclear safeguards inspectors from the IAEA , organized into an “ Action Team ” dedicated to the Iraq nuclear disarmament problem .
UNSCOM maintained political control of the process , insofar as its executive chairman was the only one authorized to approve a given inspection mission .
At first , the IAEA and UNSCOM shared the technical oversight of the inspection process , but soon this was transferred completely to the IAEA ’s Action Team , and UNSCOM ’s nuclear staff assumed more of an advisory and liaison function .
In August 1992 I began cooperating closely with IAEA ’s Action Team , traveling to Vienna , where the IAEA maintained its headquarters .
The IAEA had in its possession a huge cache of documents seized from Iraq during a series of inspections in the summer of 1991 and , together with other U.N. inspectors , I was able to gain access to these documents for the purpose of extracting any information which might relate to UNSCOM ’s non-nuclear mission .
These documents proved to be very valuable in that regard , and a strong working relationship was developed .
Over the coming years I frequently traveled to Vienna , where I came to know the members of the IAEA Action Team as friends and dedicated professionals .
Whether poring over documents , examining bits and pieces of equipment ( the IAEA kept a sample of an Iraqi nuclear centrifuge in its office ) or ruminating about the difficult political situation that was Iraq over wine and cheese on a Friday afternoon , I became familiar with the core team of experts who composed the IAEA Action Team .
I bring up this history because during the entire time of my intense , somewhat intimate cooperation with the IAEA Action Team , one name that never entered into the mix was David Albright .
Albright is the president of the Institute for Science and International Security ( ISIS , an institute which he himself founded ) , and has for some time now dominated the news as the “ go - to ” guy for the U.S. mainstream media when they need “ expert opinion ” on news pertaining to nuclear issues .
Most recently , Albright could be seen commenting on a report he authored , released by ISIS on June 16 , in which he discusses the alleged existence of a computer owned by Swiss - based businessmen who were involved in the A.Q.
Khan nuclear black market ring .
According to Albright , this computer contained sensitive design drawings of a small , sophisticated nuclear warhead which , he speculates , could fit on a missile delivery system such as that possessed by Iran .
I have no objection to an academically based think tank capable of producing sound analysis about the myriad nuclear - based threats the world faces today .
But David Albright has a track record of making half - baked analyses derived from questionable sources seem mainstream .
He breathes false legitimacy into these factually challenged stories by cloaking himself in a résumé which is disingenuous in the extreme .
Eventually , one must begin to question the motives of Albright and ISIS .
No self - respecting think tank would allow itself to be used in such an egregious manner .
The fact that ISIS is a creation of Albright himself , and as such operates as a mirror image of its founder and president , only underscores the concerns raised when an individual lacking in any demonstrable foundation of expertise has installed himself into the mainstream media in a manner that corrupts the public discourse and debate by propagating factually incorrect , illogical and misleading information .
In his résumé Albright prominently advertises himself as a “ former U.N. weapons inspector . ”
Indeed , this is the first thing that is mentioned when he describes himself to the public .
Witness an Op - Ed piece in The Washington Post which he jointly authored with Jacqueline Shire in January 2008 , wherein he is described as such : “ David Albright , a former U.N. weapons inspector , is president of the Institute for Science and International Security . ”
His erstwhile U.N. credentials appear before his actual job title .
Now , this is not uncommon .
I do the same thing when describing myself , noting that I was a former U.N. weapons inspector in Iraq from 1991 to 1998 .
I feel comfortable doing this , because it ’s true and because my résumé is relevant to my writing .
In his official ISIS biography , Albright details his “ U.N. inspector ” experience as such : “ Albright cooperated actively with the IAEA Action Team from 1992 until 1997 , focusing on analyses of Iraqi documents and past procurement activities .
In June 1996 , he was the first non-governmental inspector of the Iraqi nuclear program .
On this inspection mission , Albright questioned members of Iraq ’s former uranium enrichment programs about their statements in Iraq ’s draft Full , Final , and Complete Declaration . ”
Now , as I have explained previously , I cooperated actively between 1992 and 1998 with the IAEA Action team , covering the same ground that David Albright claims to have .
I do not doubt his assertion that he was in contact with the IAEA during the period claimed ; I just doubt the use of the word actively to describe this cooperation .
Maybe Albright was part of a top - secret “ shadow ” inspection activity that I was unaware of .
I strongly doubt this .
In 1992 , when Albright states he began his “ active cooperation ” with the IAEA , he was serving as a “ Senior Staff Scientist ” with the Federation of American Scientists .
That same year Albright , in collaboration with Frans Berkhout of Sussex University and William Walker of the University of St. Andrews , published “ World Inventory of Plutonium and Highly Enriched Uranium , ” 1992 ( SIPRI and Oxford University Press ) .
From March 1991 until July 1992 , Albright , together with Mark Hibbs , wrote a series of seven articles on the Iraqi nuclear weapons programs for the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists .
The final three articles of this series , entitled “ Iraq ’s Bomb : Blueprints and Artifacts , ” “ Iraq : It ’s all over at Al Atheer ” and “ Iraq ’s shop - till - you - drop nuclear program , ” were in part based upon information provided to Albright and Hibbs by the IAEA in response to questions posed by the two authors .
So far as I can tell , this is the true nature of David Albright ’s “ active cooperation . ”
Far from being a subject - matter expert brought in by the IAEA to review Iraqi documents , Albright was simply an outsider with questions .
In the November / December 1995 issue of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists , Albright wrote an article , co-authored with Robert Kelley , titled “ Has Iraq come clean at last ? ” I know Bob Kelley .
In August 1992 , it was Kelley , then deputy to Action Team leader Maurizio Zifferero , who helped me and other UNSCOM inspectors gain access to the Iraqi documents under IAEA control .
Kelley was , and is , a great safeguards inspector , and among his many accomplishments is his leading role in directing the IAEA ’s investigation into South Africa ’s unilaterally dismantled nuclear weapons program in the mid-1990s .
Bob Kelley had served as David Albright ’s “ in ” at the IAEA since 1992 , when he started providing Albright with access to some of the IAEA ’s information on Iraq ’s nuclear program .
The decision to jointly author an article on Iraq was a big step toward legitimizing what had been , up until that time , an informal relationship .
The joint article with Kelley gave Albright a legitimacy within the IAEA , to the extent that there were no objections when Kelley recommended inviting Albright to participate in a surge of inspections .
It was during the aftermath of the defection of Saddam Hussein ’s son- in - law , Hussein Kamal , in August 1995 , and the subsequent turning over of a massive quantity of previously hidden documents , including those pertaining to nuclear issues .
These activities served as the framework around which Albright and Kelley wrote their article .
The June 1996 inspection Albright participated in was his one and only foray into Iraq as a weapons inspector .
He was not a chief inspector , nor a deputy chief inspector , nor an operations officer .
He was a minor member of the team , Bob Kelley ’s bag boy , who for the most part was there to observe .
In a round - table discussion with Iraqi nuclear scientists , attended by all of the inspectors , Albright was able to ask a few questions , not from the standpoint of an IAEA expert , but more as an informed tourist .
I was in Iraq at the time , spearheading the very controversial UNSCOM 150 inspection , which found our team barred from entering several sensitive sites in and around Baghdad .
On the few occasions when I was able to spend some down time at the U.N. headquarters on Canal Street , I would catch up with the status of the other inspections taking place in Iraq at the same time , including the one Albright was attached to .
From all accounts , his lone stint as an inspector was at best unremarkable .
He was a dilettante in every sense of the word , a Walter Mitty - like character in a world of genuine U.N. inspectors .
There was recognition among most involved that bringing an outsider such as David Albright into the inspection process was a mistake .
Not only did he lack any experience in the nuclear weapons field ( being an outsider with only secondhand insight into limited aspects of the Iraqi program ) , he had no credibility with the Iraqi nuclear scientists , and his questions , void of any connectivity with the considerable record of interaction between the IAEA and Iraq , were not taken seriously by either side .
Albright left Iraq in June 1996 , and was never again invited back .
This is the reality of the relationship between Albright and the IAEA , and the singular event in his life which he uses as the justification for prominently promoting himself as a “ former U.N. inspector . ”
While not outright fraud , Albright ’s self - promoted relationship with the IAEA , and his status as a “ former U.N. inspector , ” is at best disingenuous , all the more so since he exploits this misleading biographical data in his ongoing effort to insert himself into the public eye as a nuclear weapons expert , a title not supported by anything in his life experience .
I ca n’t say for certain when Albright became “ Doctor ” Albright .
A self - described “ physicist , ” he allows the term to linger , as he does the title “ former U.N. inspector , ” in order to create the impression that he possesses a certain gravitas .
David Albright holds a master of science degree in physics from Indiana University and a master of science in mathematics from Wright State University .
I imagine that this résumé permits him to assign himself the title physicist , but not in the Robert Oppenheimer / Edward Teller sense of the word .
Whatever physics work Albright may or may not have done in his life , one thing is certain :
He has never worked as a nuclear physicist on any program dedicated to the design and / or manufacture of nuclear weapons .
He has never designed nuclear weapons and never conducted mathematical calculations in support of testing nuclear weapons , nor has he ever worked in a facility or with an organization dedicated to either .
At best , Albright is an observer of things nuclear .
But to associate his sub -par physics pedigree with genuine nuclear weapons - related work is , like his self - promotion as a “ former U.N. weapons inspector , ” disingenuous in the extreme .
His lack of any advanced educational training as a nuclear physicist , combined with his dearth of practical experience with things nuclear , is further exacerbated by his astounding assumption of the title Doctor .
In 2007 Albright received an honorary doctorate of humane letters from Wright State University .
This honorary award is a recognition that should never be belittled , but it in no way elevates Albright to the status of one who has undergone the formal educational training and has actually earned a doctorate , especially in the demanding field of nuclear physics .
While I cannot find any evidence of Albright promoting his honorary title in a manner that indicates direct fraud on his part ( i.e. , falsely claiming to be a Ph.D. in physics ) , there are far too many instances where he is referred to by those who interview him as being both “ Dr. Albright ” and a “ physicist ” that the uninformed reader might be misled into believing that the two were somehow connected .
Albright has spent the past decade building a solid reputation as an analyst of nuclear issues .
One only need look at the impressive work he and ISIS have done on the issue of North Korea to understand the potential he brings to the table as an outside observer on nuclear matters .
Informed interest , combined with sustained access to critical personalities on both sides of an issue , makes for insights and opinions that contribute in a positive manner to the overall public discourse .
No one who is interested in facilitating informed debate , discussion and dialogue about issues such as those facing us in North Korea , Iran and elsewhere can deny the value Albright brings to the table .
That his insight into these matters should be shared with members of the media is likewise something that should be encouraged .
But an analyst must be viewed in the proper perspective , and this begins by correctly defining who and what one is .
David Albright is not a former U.N. weapons inspector , but rather an accidental tourist .
To call oneself a weapons inspector suggests that one participated in the totality of the inspection process , and as such can converse readily , based on firsthand experience , about the total spectrum of issues that entails .
Albright , based on his flimsy résumé in this regard , is not capable of such , and therefore should stop referring to himself in this manner , and encourage the media to do the same .
Likewise , all reference to Albright as “ Dr. Albright ” should be eliminated , as should any reference which places the words physicist and nuclear in proximity .
Let his work be judged on its own merit , and not camouflaged behind misleading perceptions created through false advertising .
In that he never has designed or worked in a nuclear reactor , never has designed or worked on nuclear weapons , in fact never has done anything of a practical , hands - on nature in the nuclear field , to call Albright an expert is a disservice to the term and , again , misleading in the extreme .
It is not a sin to merely be informed , or to possess a specialty .
But informed specialists are a dime a dozen .
There is a reason mainstream media do not turn to bloggers when seeking out expert opinion .
And yet , when they turn to “ Dr. Albright , former U.N. weapons inspector , ” they are getting little more than a well - funded , well - connected blogger .
If one takes a closer look at the ISIS Report published by Albright on June 16 and widely quoted in the press since then , one will realize that there simply is n’t any substance to the allegations .
Albright ’s sole source seems to be a single , unnamed IAEA official , bringing to mind Bob Kelley and his role in facilitating Albright ’s “ access ” to the IAEA in the 1990s .
The remainder of the report comprises information already available to the general public , or sheer speculation .
This is , of course , the problem when someone who is not an expert on a given subject attempts to portray himself as just that .
Lacking in the foundation of knowledge and experience which generally is expected of a genuine expert , the false “ expert ” commits error after error , not only of the factual sort but also in judgment .
Had Albright in fact been a true nuclear expert , especially one fortified with firsthand experience as a former U.N. weapons inspector , he would not have had any association with Khidir Hamza , the disgraced Iraqi defector who claimed to have firsthand knowledge of Saddam Hussein ’s nuclear program .
A true nuclear expert would have recognized the technical impossibilities and inconsistencies in Hamza ’s fabrications .
And a genuine former U.N. weapons inspector would have known that Hamza had been fingered as a fraud by the IAEA and UNSCOM .
David Albright instead employed Hamza as an analyst with ISIS from 1997 until 1999 .
Albright likewise facilitated the story of former Iraqi nuclear scientist Mahdi Obeidi being told to the world .
As a “ former U.N. weapons inspector , ” Albright had a passing knowledge of Obeidi ; the Iraqi was among the scientists that the IAEA team Albright served on questioned in June 1996 ( Albright himself claims to have personally questioned Obeidi ) .
Albright helped sell Obeidi ’s story about buried uranium centrifuge parts to the media , even though a true nuclear expert would have known that what Obeidi claims to have hidden possessed absolutely no value in the field of nuclear enrichment , and any former U.N. weapons inspector worth his or her salt would have recognized the inconsistencies and improbabilities in the Obeidi story .
David Albright has a history of being used by those who seek to gain media attention for their respective claims .
In addition to the Hamza and Obeidi fiascos , Albright and his organization , ISIS , have served as the conduit for other agencies gaining publicity about the alleged Iranian nuclear weapons program , the alleged Syrian nuclear reactor , and most recently the alleged Swiss computer containing sensitive nuclear design information .
On each occasion , Albright is fed sensitive information from a third party , and then packages it in a manner that is consumable by the media .
The media , engrossed with Albright ’s misleading résumé ( “ former U.N. weapons inspector , ” “ Doctor , ” “ physicist ” and “ nuclear expert ” ) , give Albright a full hearing , during which time the particulars the third - party source wanted made public are broadcast or printed for all the world to see .
More often than not , it turns out that the core of the story pushed by Albright is , in fact , wrong .
While Iran did indeed possess uranium enrichment capability at Natanz and a heavy water plant ( under construction ) at Arak ( as reported by Albright thanks to information provided by the Iranian opposition group MEK , most probably with the help of Israeli intelligence ) , Albright ’s wild speculation about weapons - grade plutonium and highly enriched uranium proved to be wrong .
There was indeed a building in Syria that was bombed by Israel .
But Albright ’s expert opinion , derived from his interpretation of photographs , consists of nothing more than simplistic observation ( “ The tall building in the image may house a reactor under construction and the pump station along the river may have been intended to supply cooling water to the reactor ” ) combined with unfocused questions that assumed much , but were in fact based on little ( “ How far along was the reactor construction project when it was bombed ?
What was the extent of nuclear assistance from North Korea ?
Which reactor components did Syria obtain from North Korea or elsewhere , and where are they now ? ” ) .
And , most recently , we have Albright commenting about the contents of a computer he has n’t even laid eyes on , though he feels confident enough to raise the specter of global nuclear catastrophe ( “ How will authorities learn if Iran , North Korea , or even terrorists bought these designs ? ”
Albright asks when referring to the contents of the Swiss computer ) .
Nowhere in his résumé does Albright cite any formal training as a photographic interpreter ; in any case , one would have to have an intimate knowledge of nuclear facilities in order to know what one was looking at when examining an aerial image .
A genuine nuclear weapons expert would have been able to discern the technical faults in the logic of the stories being peddled by Albright .
And a genuine former U.N. weapons inspector , well versed in preparing airtight investigations based upon verified intelligence information , would have balked at the shabby nature of the evidence provided .
Again , because Albright is neither , he and ISIS play the role of patsy , the middleman peddling misinformation to a media too lazy to conduct their own due diligence before running with a story .
Albright , operating under the guise of his creation , ISIS , has a track record of inserting hype and speculation about matters of great sensitivity in a manner which skews the debate toward the worst - case scenario .
Over time Albright often moderates his position , but the original sensationalism still remains , serving the purpose of imprinting a negative image in the psyche of public opinion .
This must stop .
It is high time the mainstream media began dealing with David Albright for what he is ( a third - rate reporter and analyst ) , and what he is n’t ( a former U.N. weapons inspector , doctor , nuclear physicist or nuclear expert ) .
It is time for David Albright , the accidental inspector , to exit stage right .
Issues pertaining to nuclear weapons and their potential proliferation are simply too serious to be handled by amateurs and dilettantes .
Scott Ritter was a U.N. weapons inspector in Iraq from 1991 to 1998 .
The Transportation Security Administration is trying to speed up airport screening by asking passengers to choose a line based on their familiarity with checkpoint procedures .
But human nature being what it is , this approach may hit its own snags : people typically opt for the shortest line , and all think they are experts .
“ In theory , it ’s a good idea .
It lets people say , ‘ This is my comfort level , ’ ” said Steven Frischling , a photographer from Connecticut who encountered the new system in Salt Lake City and Boston .
“ The problem is , when people show up , everyone thinks they know how to get through security . ”
The agency is using a ski slope metaphor for its three new “ self - select ” security lines .
The system , which has been introduced at 21 airports and is coming soon to New York , has a black diamond line for expert travelers , defined as those who fly more than twice a month and are skilled at security procedures , always ready with items removed ; a blue square for casual travelers , who are familiar with the screening process ; and a green circle for families and those needing assistance or more time .
The idea is that passengers will select appropriate lines for their situations .
The reality has been mixed , according to travelers who have used the lines , which were introduced in February in Salt Lake City and Denver .
This photo by Kevin Carter won the “ Pulitzer Prize ” in 1994 and became a symbol of the Sudan famine at the time .
The picture depicts stricken girl crawling towards an United Nations camp , located a kilometer away .
The vulture is waiting for the child to die so that it can eat her .
This picture shocked the whole world .
No one - including the photographer - knows what happened to the child .
Here is the story behind the picture :
In 1993 Carter headed north of the border with [ his colleague ] Silva to photograph the rebel movement in famine - stricken Sudan .
To make the trip , Carter had taken a leave from the Weekly Mail and borrowed money for the air fare .
Immediately after their plane ) touched down in the village of Ayod , Carter began snapping photos of famine victims .
Seeking relief from the sight of masses of people starving to death , he wandered into the open bush .
He heard a soft , high - pitched whimpering and saw a tiny girl trying to make her way to the feeding center .
As he crouched to photograph her , a vulture landed in view .
Careful not to disturb the bird , he positioned himself for the best possible image .
He would later say he waited about 20 minutes , hoping the vulture would spread its wings .
It did not , and after he took his photographs , he chased the bird away and watched as the little girl resumed her struggle .
Afterward he sat under a tree , lit a cigarette , talked to God and cried .
" He was depressed afterward , " Silva recalls .
" He kept saying he wanted to hug his daughter . "

Three months later Kevin Carter committed suicide .
This was Sudan in 1994 .
We are now 2008 .
Five years into Sudan 's Darfur conflict .
The humanitarian situation is just as desperate .
Maybe with less famine , but with just as much despair , as I wrote in several posts about Darfur over the past year .
Many , including celebrities like George Clooney ( watch his video diary ) , Mia Farrow ( Pictures and video ) , Angelina Jolie ( Articles ) , Steven Spielberg ( Article ) and others have done efforts to raise the awareness over the problems in Darfur .
There are groupings like the " Save Darfur Coalition " , an alliance of over 180 advocacy and humanitarian organizations representing 130 million people , and the Darfur Genocide movement .
Amesty International created Eyes on Darfur .
Numerous fundraising websites ( like The Darfur Wall ) , campaigning , video advocacy and education , awareness sites and Online Info Centers were created .
Musicians made songs like Living Darfur .
And there is even a game ( Darfur is Dying ) created to advocate the Darfur issues .
Public pressure was raised against the countries in alliance with the Sudan government , focusing lately on China and its hosting of the Olympics .
Athletes , normal citizens , students , food lovers and bloggers on a global and a local level united to raise awareness and increase pressure on the Sudanese government .
You can buy items online through Yahoo ! to show your support and you can even see how each US legislator scores on his or her support for Darfur .
Many governments responded with pressure on Sudan and several UN resolutions condemned the Darfur genocide ( Overview ) .
The African Union sent troops , and UN Peacekeepers were deployed , eventually merging into one , called UNAMID .
And still , despite all of this , peace talks have failed to get off the ground , the United Nations - African Union peacekeeping mission will not be fully deployed for months to come , and two - thirds of Darfur 's population is dependent on the world 's largest aid operation .
" The situation is not better than it was five years ago , " says Auriol Miller , head of Oxfam in Sudan .
" We would still say the situation is getting worse .
Humanitarian workers are being targeted and attacked ( see this post ) in a way that has got increasingly worse over the last few years . "
A BBC reporter recently wrote :
" When I last visited the remote , arid region in November , destitute refugees lined up at the Abu Shouk camp , desperate to tell their stories so the world could find out what had happened to them .
They spoke of toddlers being burnt alive in villages as men on horseback razed their houses to the ground ; of women being raped as they fled their homes looking for safety in the early stages of the conflict .
At night , people said they still found it hard to sleep - terrified of being killed while in their beds .

SOUTH HADLEY - A 17 - year - old Dartmouth Street teen - ager whose basement chemistry laboratory was raided in February has been indicted by a Hampshire County Grand Jury .
Northwestern District Attorney Elizabeth D. Scheibel announced the indictment of John E. Robison Jr. , of 23 Dartmouth St. , today .
The indictment charges Robison with three counts of malicious explosion and one count of willful placing of explosives near property .
Robison is expected to be summoned to Hampshire Superior Court for arraignment later this month , according to Scheibel .
Robison , whose mother Mary L. Robison has said her son had been trying to develop a bio-fuel , had his home laboratory raided starting Feb. 15 by state and federal authorities .
" My son does n't have a malicious bone in his body , " Robison said today .
" He wants to be a chemist .
He wants to be a scientist .
He was experimenting inappropriately , but it was an experiment . "
Robison is the nephew of Augusten Burroughs , who wrote the best - selling book " Running with Scissors , " which was released as a movie last year .
His father , author John Elder Robison , recently published " Look Me in the Eye , " a book about growing up with Asperger 's syndrome .
Officials from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives , the Massachusetts Fire and Explosion Investigation Unit , and the state hazardous materials response team removed chemicals from the laboratory and exploded them at the town landfill .
A portion of Dartmouth Street was closed for three days as officials entered and exited the home .
South Hadley police , fire and ambulance personnel from Fire District 1 were on standby during officials ' work with the explosive chemicals
Meanwhile , Fire District 1 Fire Chief William J. Judd hopes to recover the $ 17,619 his department spent on the incident .
Labor alone has been placed at $ 8,844 , he said .
Judd has sent an itemized list of expenses to the Scheibel 's office .
" I 'm still waiting for direction from the district attorney 's office , " Judd said .
" I 'm looking to recover something to the taxpayers of the town . "
Judd said he had seen footage on the Internet site YouTube of the local teen - ager detonating explosives near high - tension wires , but the video was later pulled from the Web site .
Police Chief David J. LaBrie has said a resident concerned about deliveries of chemicals to the house called local police , who then notified the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms , which triggered the emergency response .
Officials for both Scheibel 's office and the state Department of Fire Services have declined to release a list of chemicals confiscated from the home , citing an ongoing investigation .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - A “ silent tsunami ” unleashed by costlier food threatens 100 million people , the United Nations said on Tuesday , and aid groups said producers would make things worse if they curbed exports .

Prime Minister Gordon Brown said Britain would seek changes to EU biofuels targets if it was shown that planting crops for fuel was driving up food prices -- a day after the bloc stood by its plans to boost biofuel use .
The World Food Programme ( WFP ) , whose head Josette Sheeran took part in a meeting of experts Brown called on Tuesday to discuss the crisis , said a “ silent tsunami ” threatened to plunge more than 100 million people on every continent into hunger .
“ This is the new face of hunger -- the millions of people who were not in the urgent hunger category six months ago but now are , ” she said ahead of the meeting .
Riots in poor Asian and African countries have followed steep rises in food prices caused by many factors -- dearer fuel , bad weather , rising disposable incomes boosting demand and the conversion of land to grow crops for biofuel .
Rice from
Thailand , the world ’s top exporter , has more than doubled in price this year .
Major food exporters including Indonesia , Kazakhstan , Egypt and Cambodia have imposed curbs on food exports to secure supplies .
Sheeran said artificially created shortages aggravated the problem : “ The world has been consuming more than it has been producing for the past three years , so stocks have been drawn down . ”
Rising prices meant the WFP was running short of money to buy food for its programs and had already curtailed school feeding plans in Tajikistan , Kenya and Cambodia .
Sheeran said the WFP , which last year estimated it would need $ 2.9 billion in 2008 to cover its needs , now calculated it would have to raise that figure by a quarter because of the surge in prices of staples like wheat , maize and rice .
END OF AN ERA
Britain pledged $ 900 million to help the WFP alleviate immediate problems and Brown raised further doubts about the wisdom of using crops to help produce fuel .
“ If our UK review shows that we need to change our approach , we will also push for change in EU biofuels targets , ” he said a day after the EU stood by its target of getting a tenth of road transport fuel from crops and agricultural waste by 2020 .
Japanese Agriculture Minister Masatoshi Wakabayashi said Tokyo would propose the World Trade Organisation set clear rules for food export restrictions imposed by producer countries .
Tokyo wanted a WTO mechanism for food importers such as Japan to be able to give an opinion when notified about restrictions by an exporting country , Wakabayashi said , according to the text of a news conference published on the ministry ’s website .
Rajat Nag , managing director general of the Asian Development Bank , said the era of cheap food was over and urged Asian governments not to distort markets with export curbs but use fiscal measures to help the poor .
U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon has said dearer food risked wiping out progress on cutting poverty .
His predecessor Kofi Annan said climate change was aggravating the global food crisis and many poor countries could be facing the start of “ major hunger disasters ” .
“ The poor are bearing the brunt and they contributed the least to climate change .
The polluter must pay , ” he said .
“ Climate change is an all - encompassing threat -- a threat to our health , security , political stability and social cohesion . ”
Drinking water in Arlington , Texas , tested positive for trace concentrations of the anti-anxiety medication meprobamate , city officials revealed Monday in response to a series of public records requests .
In a February interview with The Associated Press , Mayor Robert Cluck said trace concentrations of one pharmaceutical had been found in treated drinking water , but he declined to name it .
He said revealing the name in the post - 9/11 world could cause a terrorist to intentionally release more of the drug , causing harm to residents .
" I do n't want to take that chance , " Cluck said .
" There is no public hazard , and I do n't want to create one . "
Monday 's identification of meprobamate came after the Texas attorney general said those concerns were not well founded .
In water samples taken in October 2006 , concentrations of the drug measured around 1 part per trillion , far below the levels of a medical dose .
Water department officials say their drinking water meets the highest standard of quality .
The AP reported in March that trace concentrations of pharmaceuticals have been detected in drinking water systems for 24 major U.S. metropolitan areas , affecting 41 million Americans .
As part of that series , the AP contacted Arlington officials and learned water there had been tested , but the city near Dallas was the only place in the United States included in the AP PharmaWater series that refused to release its drinking water test results .
Cluck , a medical doctor , had directed local officials in 2006 to conduct tests after hearing that traces of Prozac had been found in water elsewhere in Texas .
The tests are not required under federal or state regulations .
After the AP 's story was distributed , Arlington officials provided a few more details : trace concentrations of five pharmaceuticals — one antibiotic , two anti-seizure medications , one pain reliever and one minor tranquilizer — had been detected in the city 's untreated source water .
The city also named the five : sulfamethoxazole , dilantin , carbamazepine , naproxen and meprobamate .
But it declined at that time to identify which one also had been detected in treated drinking water .
Nine different individuals in and near Arlington including reporters , attorneys and citizens submitted legal public records requests to the city demanding the release of the specific test results .
" I was driving to work one morning when I heard the mayor on the radio say he was not going to tell the public what this substance was because he was worried about terrorism , " said Frank Hill , an attorney in Arlington who requested the records .
" That struck me as so disingenuous and typical of the city of Arlington that I just could n't let it rest .
This is our water , and our money paid for those tests . "
In an editorial in March , the Fort Worth Star - Telegram said that while Cluck " deserves kudos for anticipating the problem " he should let people know what the tests found .
The city refused , prompting the attorney general to weigh in .
In May the attorney general 's office responded that there was no proof that telling residents what has been found in their drinking water would help terrorists contaminate their supplies .
Arlington had until Monday at 5 p.m. to release the results or sue the attorney general .
Mayor Cluck said Monday he did n't think it was safe to reveal any information about what compounds can and can't make it through Arlington 's drinking water treatment plant .
" I do not feel comfortable releasing the names of what 's in our water supply and gets past our water treatment plant , even if it 's in parts per trillion .
I do n't like the concept of releasing this information because there are people who want to do us harm .
But once the attorney general said go for it , we did . "
Meanwhile , Arlington Water Utilities has posted a notice on its website that describes how pharmaceutical compounds and personal care products are being found at low levels in many of the nation 's lakes , rivers and streams .
The agency says the mayor " is leading us to do more comprehensive testing and further research of our treatment processes as more scientific research is conducted . "

Ground crews prepare B - 1 bombers in a file photo .
REUTERS / Ian Hodgson
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A U.S. B - 1 bomber caught fire after landing at an air base in Qatar on Friday but the crew escaped without injury , the Air Force said .
Fire erupted as the plane taxied after landing at al Udeid Air Base around 1:10 p.m. EDT after what the Air Force described as “ a ground incident . ”
“ The crew evacuated the aircraft and is safe .
The fire was contained , ” the Air Force said in a statement .
A board of inquiry has been appointed to investigate .
Earlier , a U.S. defense official said the B - 1 had crashed and that the cause was unknown .
The official was responding to report on Qatar - based Al Jazeera television that said the plane was a B - 52 .
The B - 1 is a long - range bomber aircraft capable of flying intercontinental missions without refueling and is able to penetrate sophisticated defensive networks .
U.S. defense officials gave few details about the incident , saying they did not know how many people were on board or what mission the bomber was conducting .
One train leaves Station A at 6 p.m. traveling at 40 miles per hour toward Station B. A second train leaves Station B at 7 p.m. traveling on parallel tracks at 50 m.p.h. toward Station A . The stations are 400 miles apart .
When do the trains pass each other ?
Entranced , perhaps , by those infamous hypothetical trains , many educators in recent years have incorporated more and more examples from the real world to teach abstract concepts .
The idea is that making math more relevant makes it easier to learn .
That idea may be wrong , if researchers at Ohio State University are correct .
An experiment by the researchers suggests that it might be better to let the apples , oranges and locomotives stay in the real world and , in the classroom , to focus on abstract equations , in this case 40 ( t + 1 ) = 400 - 50t , where t is the travel time in hours of the second train .
( The answer is below . )
“ The motivation behind this research was to examine a very widespread belief about the teaching of mathematics , namely that teaching students multiple concrete examples will benefit learning , ” said Jennifer A. Kaminski , a research scientist at the Center for Cognitive Science at Ohio State .
“ It was really just that , a belief . ”

Unbeknownst to you , an F5 tornado -- the kind that can obliterate a house in a heartbeat -- is barreling directly toward yours :
Would you prefer 60 seconds warning or 20 minutes ?
Silly question , you say ?
Yet research by a pair of Texas economists suggests that your choice may not matter in survival terms ( that you 'd have 19 minutes more to worry with option two is indisputable ) .
In fact , the study raises the question of whether that extra time might actually do more harm than good .
But they 're economists .
More surprisingly , the chief technology officer for the country 's most extensive severe weather warning network says he would " bet there is some truth to their study " -- up to a point , and with funnel cloud - sized caveats that we 'll get to in a moment .
The discussion began last week with this headline -- Early Tornado Warnings Not Always Helpful -- that appeared on the Web site LiveScience .
The researchers analyzed data from more than 18,000 tornadoes in the United States between 1986 and 2002 .
Overall , they found that early warning is very helpful :
On average it reduced expected injuries by about 32 percent .
But when the researchers examined data from the most severe cases - the 300 out of 18,000 tornadoes in which people died - the effects of advanced warning were less clear .
Overall , when people were notified of a tornado up to about 15 minutes ahead of time , deaths decreased .
However , lead times greater than 15 minutes seemed to increase fatalities compared with no warning .
What could possibly account for such a counter - intuitive outcome ?
The researchers acknowledge that their data is insufficient for firm conclusions , but here 's what they suspect :
" The concern is that longer lead times would encourage dangerous behavior , " said Kevin Simmons , an economist at Austin College in Texas .
" There is anecdotal evidence that came out of the tornadoes in Oklahoma and Missouri last week .
Out of the 23 fatalities , eight were people in cars .
I do n't know if those people were trying to outrun the storm , or if they just happened to be in their cars . "
Being from Massachusetts , where tornadoes are rare , I can claim little first - hand knowledge of such situations ( aside from that vacation scare in Minnesota where the family watched on TV as a tornado skittered by about a half - town away from our rental . )
But I know a guy who knows : Chris Sloop , CTO at Weatherbug , which operates a network of more than 8,000 tracking stations and 1,000 cameras in schools , public safety buildings and TV stations .
I made Sloop 's acquaintance in 2005 when he accused me of callous disregard for the health and well being of my fellow man after I wrote what struck me then as a rather sympathetic column about his company being at Interop .
Since that dustup , we 've become e-mail buddies .
Here 's some of what Sloop had to say about the economists ' research :
I bet there is some truth to their study .
When people do n't know what to do in a dangerous situation , many times they do the wrong thing .
I am surprised the authors did n't take that approach .
It is almost like they are saying that advance warning is a bad thing , when in reality it is a GREAT thing ; it 's just that people are not well educated enough to know how to respond .
Of course , in cases like the most severe tornados , there may not be much you can even do that will save your life .
Another factor to consider here is that technology has changed dramatically since the era of the data sample used by the economists : 1986 to 2002 .
People have a cell phone with them now wherever they go .
The alerts that people get now are very localized and direct .
So , there is much less worry about the crying wolf syndrome where people just ignore warnings ... and with our system , people can be alerted to just knowing that severe weather conditions are heading their way .
...
The key though , is education and preparation .
You need to know exactly what you are going to do when faced with a dangerous situation .
Work and recreational habits have changed as well , he notes .
The final thing I would like to point out is that all of these articles always talk about NOAA Weather Radio and television / radio like they are the only ways to get weather warnings .
Who watches TV any more ?
People are on computers more than TV ; I know I am and that is why products such as WeatherBug Desktop or WeatherBug Alert are very important .
Not to mention all the cell phone / SMS capabilities .
Coincidentally , as I started to write this post , I received an alert about potentially damaging thunderstorms with marble - sized hail moving through my area .
No , it was n't from TV , radio or Weatherbug , rather it came via old - fashioned e-mail from a friend who for years has provided the service as a hobby .
It works ... but like I said earlier , we do n't get the killer storms in these parts very often .
In the event our luck does run out , please put me down for as much warning as possible .

( CNN ) --
Life for the millions of people in Darfur 's aid camps is a living hell .
Women are often raped while out collecting firewood and security is so bad aid trucks can't get through , resulting in food handouts being halved .
A refugee from the western Sudanese region of Darfur stands in front of a makeshift hut .
So far this year 66 trucks belonging to the U.N. 's World Food Programme have been hijacked , three drivers killed in attacks and thirty more drivers are still missing .
A United Nations peacekeeping force with the power to shoot back if attacked has been deployed in Darfur in recent months , but despite being the largest ever sanctioned by the U.N. it is undermanned and under -equipped .
The troops say there is no peace to keep and their troops are being attacked .
Recently 60 militiamen on horseback raided a peacekeeping patrol , stealing soldiers ' weapons , ammunition , money and even their cell phones .
The crisis in Darfur first began when rebels who are mostly ethnic African farmers attacked government outposts in 2002 because they wanted power .
The Sudanese government repressed the insurgency , bombing villages and arming nomadic Arab herdsmen , Janjaweed , who have a history of land disputes with the farmers .
In five years of war the U.N. says more than four million people have been affected : Two - and - a - half million people forced from their homes and more than 300,000 killed .
Sudanese officials dispute those numbers claiming only 10,000 have died -- a number they say is normal for five years of war .
Watch officials deny Darfur crimes »
U.S. President George W. Bush calls the killings genocide and has put sanctions on Sudan .
The U.N. says Sudan 's government is guilty of crimes against humanity and of violating international human rights laws every bit as heinous and serious they say as genocide .
In February 2008 , a fresh wave of killing forced 58,000 people to flee their homes as government troops and Janjaweed militiamen retaliated against rebels .
A U.N. report said Sudan broke international law as 115 innocent civilians were killed using tactics similar to those employed in 2003 , 2004 , the worst years of the war .
At first glance , the most recent advertisement for Turin Bicycles Ltd. ( viewable by clicking here ) is thoroughly non-controverial : images of bikes , highways , traffic and various portions of the store ’s 700 Lincoln Street headquarters accompanied by a voiceover that touts pedaling as an environmentally conscious commuting choice .
Look closely , though , and you ’ll see a quick flash , literally – a shot of a woman astride a two - wheeler wearing nothing but a pair of red pumps .
This special extra was the brainstorm of Scott Redmond , a former KHOW talk - show host who now runs his own advertising agency , Clear Static Media , and it was included with the full knowledge and amused consent of Turin ’s owner , Alan Fine .
Moreover , Redmond and Fine say that the the commercial ran for two weeks in May on a variety of prominent cable channels – USA , TNT , ESPN , Discovery , Spike , even CNN and the History Channel – before the folks at Comcast pulled the plug , allegedly over viewer complaints .
Not that Redmond is apologizing for the stunt .
“ It ’s so hard to break through the clutter , ” he says .
“ Anything I can do to cause somebody to think , ‘ Did I just see that ? , ’ I ’m going to do . ”
Redmond ’s emergence as an image maker comes after decades spent in a non-visual medium .
As noted in this January 2003 Message column , the New Orleans native got into radio in 1974 , and over the next seventeen years , he deejayed on a series of rock and contemporary - hit stations in his hometown and markets such as San Diego .
He also branched out into television , hosting a mid-‘80s dance show called Airwaves and serving as chief yakker for Talk TV , a program that prefigured a new direction on radio for him .
He gabbed in settings such as Philadelphia , Miami , Seattle and Portland , Oregon before being hired by Clear Channel in 2002 to helm the KHOW afternoon - drive slot previously overseen by ex-Broncos player Reggie Rivers .
But Redmond failed to set the outlet ’s ratings ablaze , and as noted in the second item of this September 2004 Message , he was ultimately given the heave - ho in favor of Dan Caplis and Craig Silverman , who continue to man the microphones during this time period .
Redmond was blindsided by the move , which still gets his blood boiling nearly four years later .
“ I told Clear Channel that I was moving my girlfriend here , ” he recalls .
“ I spent $ 4,000 to move her after two and a half years of waiting , because she was afraid that what happened in Portland would happen here .
But they told me , ‘ No , go ahead and have her move here . ’
And three and a half weeks later , everything happened . ”
A yearlong period of financial pain followed , which Redmond spent in part “ trying to figure out what I wanted to do , ” he says .
Finally , he landed a position as creative director at Lakewood ’s CP&I Marketing and fell in love with the world of advertising – so much so that when Clear Channel offered him a show in post - Katrina New Orleans in 2006 , he passed .
( Of course , his history with the company played a part as well .
“ I was still really bitter , ” he concedes . )
Then , later that year , he formed Clear Static , and since then , he ’s assembled commercials for a growing list of clients , including Beau Jo ’s Pizza , The Broker Restaurant , Kaufman ’s Tall & Big Shop , Fatburger and Wingman Wings .
Most of the spots have run in the Denver area , but a few have also screened in Portland and New Orleans , where he still has contacts .
“ I ’ll bet in two years I ’ve done seventy commercials , ” he estimates .
Which brings us to the Turin ad .
Fine liked a commercial Clear Static had assembled for the firm last year , so he asked Redmond to come up with something new for 2008 – and man , did he .
“ He ’s a really creative guy , ” Fine allows , “ and he said , ‘ Let ’s put in a little subliminal thing .
People wo n’t really see it – but even if you do n’t recognize what it is , it ’ll draw your attention . ’”
That was fine by Fine , so Redmond asked Sydney Fox , a photographer with whom he works , if she knew some models who’d be game to participate and was surprised when she personally volunteered for the gig .
Redmond jokes that the cameraman on the shoot “ asked for a few extra takes . ”
Still , he emphasizes that “ it ’s shot from the side , so you ca n’t see her boobs or anything really private .
And you see it so briefly ” – although not as briefly as originally envisioned .
In his first cut , Redmond included just ten frames of Fox , but at Fine ’s suggestion , he bumped it up to sixteen before sending it to Comcast .
The pair half - expected the spot to be rejected in advance , but no .
It was approved for broadcast and began running on a slew of Comcast ’s cable channels “ with pretty good frequency , ” Fine maintains .
“ It could have run a couple of hundred times . ”
During that span , he heard from at least one regular customer who ’d seen
Fox and thought her cameo was hilarious , while several others made mention of having caught the commercial but either did n’t register the nudity or were n’t bothered by it .
Someone was , however .
After about two weeks , a representative at CP&I , which handled the ad buy , received a call from a Comcast staffer , who said the ad would be yanked as a result of subscriber gripes and would n't reappear until the Fox segment wound up on the cutting - room floor .
This verdict does n’t bother Fine .
Although he thinks the images are tame compared to a lot of material that Comcast broadcasts on a routine basis , “ I do n’t consider it to be a violation of my free - speech rights or anything like that . ”
In regard to the impact of Fox ’s appearance , “ maybe there was nothing at all , ” he concedes .
“ Maybe it was just a lark and it had no impact .
But it was fun . ”
That ’s the way Redmond feels , too – and he ’s ready to try it again .
“ I ’ve got plans to put other nude people in ads , ” he says .
A special note to Tivo owners :
You might want to take a break from skipping all those commercials .

What does it take to bring Joe 's Goals down ?
So some of you may have noticed that Joe 's Goals went down today ( August 16th at around 5 : AM Pacific Time ) .
While your first thought may have been that I rolled out some untested code , I wanted to assure you that the problem was much bigger than that .
It appears some good folks doing work outside the datacenter where Web 2.0 is hosted cut the fiber line and all hell hit the fan .
The pictures were so cool I just had to put them up somewhere .
While the Verizon techs initially tried to fix it ( are they out of their minds ?!
Look at that cut !
Brain surgery would be easier than that , and quicker ! ) they gave up after four hours and decided to run a brand new line to the datacenter .
They got it installed and service was restored around 5:15 PM Pacific Time .
Thanks for your patience !
Joe
