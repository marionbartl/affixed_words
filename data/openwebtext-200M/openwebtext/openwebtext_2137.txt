Ah the lengths people will go to for a great location and even greater views .
“ Separation Creek House ” by Jackson Clements Burrows ( JCB ) Architects takes cliff building to knew heights .
Built on a forty - five degree incline , the property presented unparalleled challenges .
‘ Most of the one hectare site was too steep to build on .
Only a few hundred square metres offered space for a building , ’ says architect Graham Burrows , one of three directors of the practice .
‘ We wanted to create a dynamic sculptural object .
But we also wanted to take advantage of the views , ’ says Burrows .
Perched on a base footprint of barely seven by nine metres , this tranquil looking house seems to blossom out of the hillside like a squared mushroom .

PBS did an excellent report on the explosive NY Times story which says : the Pentagon may influence the analysis of some retired military personnel who appear on television news programs .
Oh , really ?
Wow , I never would have guessed .
I 've covered this scandal at length already , but since Network News refuses to comment on this report , I 'll keep pushing it .
And I thank PBS for also not sticking their heads in the sand .

Woodruff : And for the record , we invited Fox News , CNN , MSNBC , CBS , ABC and NBC to participate , but they declined our offer or did not respond .
We 've been talking to the Pentagon since Monday about participating in this segment .
But when we finally scheduled it today , they were unable to supply a guest on short notice .
Bob Zelnick admirably plays the media 's chief apologist for this segment .
It 's not surprising that someone that works in the media defends them to the end .
The Pentagon and the Networks thank you .
JUDY WOODRUFF : How surprised were you to see this report ?
BOB ZELNICK : I was n't surprised at all .
In fact , when I covered the Pentagon , I often sought information from retired generals and admirals and colonels because I knew they were well - informed .
I knew they kept in touch .
I knew they had drinks at the Army - Navy Club .
I know they went to Army - Navy football games on special trains together .
I knew that many of them were serving as what we called Beltway bandits or consultants .
So I was n't surprised at all , except by the amount of space devoted to this piece by the New York Times .
JUDY WOODRUFF : Since the months leading up to the start of the Iraq war in March 2003 , dozens of retired military officers served as analysts on cable and network television .
JUDY WOODRUFF :
These former generals and colonels have been a mainstay of commentary and analysis .
And the networks paid them for their appearances .
Now , a lengthy New York Times investigation , published on Sunday , revealed the Pentagon targeted many of these analysts as part of an information apparatus to generate favorable news coverage of the administration 's wartime performance .

The News Hour :
Pentagon officials organized hundreds of private meetings with senior military leaders and the military analysts .
They included talks with Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld .
Uptick in native Unicode webpages
Just last December there was an interesting milestone on the web .
For the first time , we found that Unicode was the most frequent encoding found on web pages , overtaking both ASCII and Western European encodings — and by coincidence , within 10 days of one another .
What 's more impressive than simply overtaking them is the speed with which this happened ; take a look at the blue line in this graph .
You can see a long - term decline in pages encoded in ASCII ( unaccented letters A through Z ) .
More recently , there 's been a significant drop in the use of encodings covering only Western European letters ( ASCII and a few accented letters like Ä , Ç , and Ø ) .
We 're seeing similar declines in other language - specific encodings .
Unicode , on the other hand , is showing a sharp increase in usage .
This is based on our indexing of web pages , and thus may vary somewhat from what other search engines find .
However , the trends are pretty clear , and the continued rise in use of Unicode makes it even easier to do the processing for the many languages that we cover .
HNN Poll : 61 % of Historians Rate the Bush Presidency Worst

Paying the price for eight years of Bush Nate Silver : History May -- or May Not -- Judge Bush More Kindly
“ As far as history goes and all of these quotes about people trying to guess what the history of the Bush administration is going to be , you know , I take great comfort in knowing that they do n’t know what they are talking about , because history takes a long time for us to reach . ” —
George W. Bush , Fox News Sunday , Feb10 , 2008 A Pew Research Center poll released last week found that the share of the American public that approves of President George W. Bush has dropped to a new low of 28 percent .
An unscientific poll of professional historians completed the same week produced results far worse for a president clinging to the hope that history will someday take a kinder view of his presidency than does contemporary public opinion .
In an informal survey of 109 professional historians conducted over a three - week period through the History News Network , 98.2 percent assessed the presidency of Mr. Bush to be a failure while 1.8 percent classified it as a success .
Asked to rank the presidency of George W. Bush in comparison to those of the other 41 American presidents , more than 61 percent of the historians concluded that the current presidency is the worst in the nation ’s history .
Another 35 percent of the historians surveyed rated the Bush presidency in the 31st to 41st category , while only four of the 109 respondents ranked the current presidency as even among the top two - thirds of American administrations .
At least two of those who ranked the current president in the 31 - 41 ranking made it clear that they placed him next - to - last , with only James Buchanan , in their view , being worse .
“ He is easily one of the 10 - worst of all time and — if the magnitude of the challenges and opportunities matter — then probably in the bottom five , alongside Buchanan , Johnson , Fillmore , and Pierce , ” wrote another historian .
The reason for the hesitancy some historians had in categorizing the Bush presidency as the worst ever , which led them to place it instead in the “ nearly the worst ” group , was well expressed by another historian who said , “ It is a bit too early to judge whether Bush 's presidency is the worst ever , though it certainly has a shot to take the title .
Without a doubt , it is among the worst . ”
In a similar survey of historians I conducted for HNN four years ago , Mr. Bush had fared somewhat better , with 19 percent rating his presidency a success and 81 percent classifying it as a failure .
More striking is the dramatic increase in the percentage of historians who rate the Bush presidency the worst ever .
In 2004 , only 11.6 percent of the respondents rated Bush ’s presidency last .
That conclusion is now reached by nearly six times as large a fraction of historians .
There are at least two obvious criticisms of such a survey .
It is in no sense a scientific sample of historians .
The participants are self - selected , although participation was open to all historians .
Among those who responded are several of the nation ’s most respected historians , including Pulitzer and Bancroft Prize winners .
The second criticism that is often raised of historians making such assessments of a current president is that it is far too early .
We do not yet know how the things that Mr. Bush has done will work out in the future .
As the only respondent who classified the current presidency among the ten best noted , “ Any judgment of his ‘ success ’ or lack thereof is premature in that the ultimate effects of his policies are not yet known . ”
True enough .
But this historian went on to make his current evaluation , giving Bush “ high marks for courage in his willingness to attack intractable problems in the Near East and to touch the Social Security ‘ Third Rail . ’ ”
Historians are in a better position than others to make judgments about how a current president ’s policies and actions compare with those of his predecessors .
Those judgments are always subject to change in light of future developments .
But that is no reason not to make them now .
The comments that many of the respondents included with their evaluations provide a clear sense of the reasons behind the overwhelming consensus that George W. Bush ’s presidency is among the worst in American history .
“ No individual president can compare to the second Bush , ” wrote one .
“ Glib , contemptuous , ignorant , incurious , a dupe of anyone who humors his deluded belief in his heroic self , he has bankrupted the country with his disastrous war and his tax breaks for the rich , trampled on the Bill of Rights , appointed foxes in every henhouse , compounded the terrorist threat , turned a blind eye to torture and corruption and a looming ecological disaster , and squandered the rest of the world ’s goodwill .
In short , no other president ’s faults have had so deleterious an effect on not only the country but the world at large . ”
“ With his unprovoked and disastrous war of aggression in Iraq and his monstrous deficits , Bush has set this country on a course that will take decades to correct , ” said another historian .
“ When future historians look back to identify the moment at which the United States began to lose its position of world leadership , they will point — rightly — to the Bush presidency .
Thanks to his policies , it is now easy to see America losing out to its competitors in any number of area : China is rapidly becoming the manufacturing powerhouse of the next century , India the high tech and services leader , and Europe the region with the best quality of life . ”
One historian indicated that his reason for rating Bush as worst is that the current president combines traits of some of his failed predecessors : “ the paranoia of Nixon , the ethics of Harding and the good sense of Herbert Hoover .
. . . .
God willing , this will go down as the nadir of American politics . ”
Another classified Bush as “ an ideologue who got the nation into a totally unnecessary war , and has broken the Constitution more often than even Nixon .
He is not a conservative , nor a Christian , just an immoral man . . . . ”
Still another remarked that Bush ’s “ denial of any personal responsibility can only be described as silly . ”
“ It would be difficult to identify a President who , facing major international and domestic crises , has failed in both as clearly as President Bush , ” concluded one respondent .
“ His domestic policies , ” another noted , “ have had the cumulative effect of shoring up a semi- permanent aristocracy of capital that dwarfs the aristocracy of land against which the founding fathers rebelled ; of encouraging a mindless retreat from science and rationalism ; and of crippling the nation ’s economic base . ”
“ George Bush has combined mediocrity with malevolent policies and has thus seriously damaged the welfare and standing of the United States , ” wrote one of the historians , echoing the assessments of many of his professional colleagues .
“ Bush does only two things well , ” said one of the most distinguished historians .
“ He knows how to make the very rich very much richer , and he has an amazing talent for f**king up everything else he even approaches .
His administration has been the most reckless , dangerous , irresponsible , mendacious , arrogant , self - righteous , incompetent , and deeply corrupt one in all of American history . ”
Four years ago I rated George W. Bush ’s presidency as the second worst , a bit above that of James Buchanan .
Now , however , like so many other professional historians , I see the administration of the second Bush as clearly the worst in our history .
My reasons are similar to those cited by other historians :
In the wake of the terrorist attacks on September 11 , 2001 , the United States enjoyed enormous support around the world .
President Bush squandered that goodwill by taking the country into an unnecessary war of choice and misleading the American people to gain support for that war .
And he failed utterly to have a plan to deal with Iraq after the invasion .
He further undermined the international reputation of the United States by justifying torture .
Mr. Bush inherited a sizable budget surplus and a thriving economy .
By pushing through huge tax cuts for the rich while increasing federal spending at a rapid rate , Bush transformed the surplus into a massive deficit .
The tax cuts and other policies accelerated the concentration of wealth and income among the very richest Americans .
These policies combined with unwavering opposition to necessary government regulations have produced the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression .
Then there is the incredible shrinking dollar , the appointment of incompetent cronies , the totally inexcusable failure to react properly to the disaster of Hurricane Katrina , the blatant disregard for the Constitution — and on and on .
Like a majority of other historians who participated in this poll , my conclusion is that the preponderance of the evidence now indicates that , while this nation has had at least its share of failed presidencies , no previous presidency was as large a failure in so many areas as the current one .

Actually , the one TRUE measure of accuracy in history is who , behind the curtain , is paying the historian doing the " research " .
Example ;
Zionist / neocon " spin " calls Reagan a great president .
He was a traitor as is " Ollie " North .
One whom , I heard with my own ears , Reagan called a " true American Hero " .
Now , if running interference for a treasonous president can be construed as " heroic " I guess he was then ?

Robert Eoin Downey - 12/28/2008 Mr. Ullman , I take issue with most of your comments .
Not all , but most .
There seems debate as to when historians should be allowed to take aim at events and declare their opinion .
I 'm not a historian , just an observer of events .
I served a very successful term as mayor of my Town and contributed with leadership to bring my people back from a previous time of confusion and terrible division .
My administration was during a period embedded in the Bush years .
The strategies I used to make it happen were totally opposite to what I 've seen from the Bush admistration .
It has been painful to watch this example of the ' Peter Principle ' take this nation in directions I never thought possible .
Without reservation , I believe right now is time to look at the years of GWB .
Historians need to serve in the effort of determing how we got here so current leaders will have a base point from which to work forward to clean up a terrible mess .
To me , an event becomes history the moment after the occurence .
If I burn my hand on a hot stove , the pain I feel is the undeniable result of an event that has just occured .
I do n't need to wait to analyze the effect .
I 'll begin to live with that result immediately .
I do n't need to wait for someone else to tell me my hand hurts !
The 109 ' historians ' in the poll were not stated to represent a scientific selection , nor were their opinions expected to be the final call on the eight years of President Bush .
Learned is that 109 educated people in April 2008 , weighed in with their ' current view ' .
These views will undoubtedly be tempered in the future as the domestic misery subsides and if Iraq become a success .
I agree there were plenty of events that were not ' caused ' by George Bush but how he reacted is fair game for historians , right now .
You cite several and I 'm not going to debate each now , case by case .
If you like the way these past eight years have evolved and see GWB as an innocent player in a world of unpreventable events you have company .
About 20 % of our population will agee with you

It does not take a collection of emminent scholars to deduce the fact that George W. Bush 's presidency is an abject , complete failure .
He single - handedly amassed the greatest debt in our entire history , is responsible for the deaths and disfigurement of countless Afghani , Iraqi and American peoples , failed to defend and protect the Constitution ( by torturing and indefinitely detaining foreign nationals , denying legal rights to suspects , abrogating the Constitutional rights of Americans , etc , etc ) waged an unjust war on false pretenses , failed to protect Americans from imminent danger from Al Qaeda , failed to help Americans affected by Katrina , and is currently overseeing the continued implosion of our economy .
Were Mr. Bush and his many agents not the most immoral and delusional and incompetent group of public servents I do believe that the American people never would have considered -- let alone elected -- the first colored American to be our next President .
Thank you , thank you , thank you W .
Michael Wade - 11/30/2008
Let 's see : runaway debt , a disastrously unnecessary war , the calculated erosion of the Bill of Rights , failure to deal with illegal immigration , and the collapse of the country 's financial system .
Amazing that someone could consider serious concerns over these follies , and others , merely evidence of bias by historians , people who generally deal in reasoned judgments based on evidence .
There 's a problem with judgment alright , but not in the survey .

I doubt if historians would consider their anger toward Bush and his supporters .
I can understand how this anger exists since many of Bush 's supporters remain firmly in the Reagan Camp .
Reagan had a great deal of success against academics who managed in their desire for freedom to help boost him into office .
This was just like Coolidge who was glad the policemen went on strike and decided against their better judgment to stay out
Similar actions by supporters have doomed presidents .
Imagine FDR without the Bonus Army , Hoover , and MacArthur .
Imagine Tricky Dick Nixon running on a platform called " Closing the Credibility Gap . "
However , Bush condemned his party by sending not one , but two old white men to the Supreme Court confirmation hearings .
Single handedly this destroyed any chance for the Republicans to reach out to Hispanics and Women .
Like LBJ , Nixon , Hoover , Buchanan , Van Buren , Wilson , who left their party in shambles , Bush will go down as a failure .
The numbers do not lie .
He managed to help torpedo the House Republicans and went a long way toward wiping out a plausible majority in the Senate .
Above all he ignored a reasonable reform of the medical system and the present insurance industry which has lived off offshore accounts , and feeble non-profit accounting principles .
If 75 % of the people want these reforms , what good does it do to oppose the numbers ?

Is n't it a bit too early for historians to be rating Bush ?
Should n't we wait about 50 or so years to see how all the policies he enacted play out ?
joseph ullman - 9/6/2008 had to look up a few things to continue my response to McElvaine .
At the time RMN ( that 's Richard Milhous Nixon ) was resigning , I suspect there would n't be many people who would have rated his administration (s ) highly .
A detested crook , a brooding personality , alleged AntiSemite ( always amazed at these anti semites who hire guys like Henry Kissinger ) , who resigned in shame .
So let 's look at his legacy , and compare it , say , to GWB or Jimmy Carter , or Bill Clinton .
What did RMN accomplish ?
The EPA was started during his administration .
He ended the Vietnam war , inherited from the Eisenhower / Kennedy / Johnson administrations .
( BTW , how many kids were killed in Vietnam , compared , to say , Iraq ?
How many kids were killed in Iraq to date compared to the daily death toll WORLDWIDE in WWI ?
Answers below , historians ) .
Let 's see , oh yes .
He opened the way to China for international relations .
Let 's see , oh yes .
He actually outlined the strategy to defeat the USSR - ( not sure if that is a good thing or a bad thing in the eyes of the 109 historians here .... ) in his book The Real War , which was subsequently credited to Ronald Reagan .
He - oh yes , during his administration 18 year olds got the vote .
Now the demographics of that one - millions of kids who can't find Iraq on a map - voting for Obama - that is sure to warm the hearts of the Bush haters .
So , 5 major accomplishments - huge accomplishments - for the most hated president in my lifetime .
And carter or clintons ' legacy ?
45,000 dead during Vietnam ; what - 3500 so far in Iraq ?
Some quagmire .
3500 in Iraq .
6000 - 9000 people a DAY died worldwide from WWI .
A day .
Consider the source , ladies and gentlemen .
These 109 historians hate GWB .
They are guilty of letting their opinions masquerade as history .
Shame on all of them .
joseph ullman - 9/6/2008 this is amazing .
This qualifies as a headline , as history ?
First of all , this is an informal " poll " of 109 people ?
Who are they ?
What are their qualifications ?
OK , Mr. McElvaine is from Milsaps college .
Now , to paraphrase a liberal blogger commenting on Sarah Palin , is Milsaps a , uh , third tier college ?
So just for an introduction , Mr. McElvaine categorizes all GWB 's failings , which is nice , because when I hear assholes like James Carville proclaim that GWB is the worst president of all time , nobody can actually tell me why .
But any historian without bias and with intelligence certainly knows that the ramifications of a presidency take decades to play out , and likewise the successes and failures are often not immediately visible .
Likewise , the successes can be on the coattails of prior administration 's , and finally there are many things a President has nothing to do with , like economic cycles .
But as i was reading these screeds , which basically amount to stock liberal complaints - violation of the Constitution , a meaningless war , fall of the dollar , etc. one stood out .
That is the line " And he failed utterly to have a plan to deal with Iraq after the invasion " .
Well , what do you know .
Just this morning , oh , about 8 AM , I read this line in Ken Timmerman 's book Shadow Warriors .
" The detailed blueprint for the post war period became known as OPLAN Iraqi Reconstruction .
Nearly 300 pages long , it was activated at the end of April 2003 by USCENTCOM OPORD 10 - 03 .
Postwar reconstruction was split up into seven broad areas ..... the elite media continued to blast out their preagreed message .
BUsh had launced the wrong war in the wrong place , with NO PLAN for after the shooting stopped .
No one seemed to care that those accusations were untrue . "
There are many other leaps of opinion in Mr. McElvaine 's editorial .
The usual clamor about making the rich richer , the acceleration of wealth among the richest Americans , incompetent cronies ( name them .
Compared to what ?
Clinton ?
Carter ? you must be kidding . )
Greatest economic crisis ?
Where are the breadlines , the strikes , the starvation , the 21 % interest rates ?
Where 's Ray Nagin and the idiocy of the populace in NOLA during Katrina , Mr. McElvaine ?
I was sitting in Maine watching the Weather Channel and I KNEW the storm was coming .
Do n't lay it all on Mr. Bush .
And you should know you cannot judge a war 's success during its campaigns .
And it is downright silly to point to Bush as responsible for the loss of American dominance .
That is a complex series of events that has developed over decades with the advent of the microchip , cross fertilization ( and theft ) of intellectual property by the Chinese , cost of doing business being cheaper in India , and American reconstruction of Europe after the second world war .
Mr. McElvaine , you should n't be allowed to teach , because you just are n't credible and have n't documented your points .

It seems that the comments by George Shirey and Jonathan Maskevich best sum up this biased attack on Bush by a barrage of leftist liberals .
I am no Bush fan anymore , I did vote for him , but rating him the worst of all time is not only wrong but also premature .
I learned early on that you cannot truly judge a president that is currently in office .
Far too many repercussions occur years or even a decade later and top secret information cannot be released until a comfortable amount of time transpires in order to preserve nation security .
However , my assessment was that we cannot fully judge Bush here and now , but his ratings and actions have indeed fallen short in many avenues .
His ineptitude regarding border control is just one of those many deficits and condoning the economic domination by China and India are crucial problems that we must tackle .
However , as others here noted , Bush did have to confront a new foe that is nothing like what the military is accustomed to .
Radical Islamic zealots that become suicide bombers are nothing like a legitimate nation that can be easily targeted and reproved .
Furthermore , those that overlook the concessions and ineptitude of Jimmy Carter , which caused tremendous repercussions for America , as the Soviets spread communism across the globe under his reign more than any other president , plus he gave away the Panama Canal , and the Iranians held American hostages until the day Reagan took office , must be placed along side Bush to realize that others might steal the dishonor of " Worst President " along with Buchanan .
On a final note , and as others here keenly noted , Saddam was indeed a brutal mass murderer , yet these pious historians on this Democratic panel clearly overlook that huge and heinous issue .
Perhaps if they lived in Iraq under his bloody regime their opinions would be different .
Never mind perhaps ... MOST ASSUREDLY !

I know another poster mentioned it earlier already but it is worth noting again ; the amount of information we have access to now , and the speed with which we are able to access it as compared to Truman 's time .
A history teacher of mine in High School once said that it usually takes about 20 years before something can officially deemed ' history ' .
That being said , I think its fair to pass judgment on Bush now based on the things we know , while simultaneously recognizing that the later historical record may contradict our current findings .
Cole Greenman - 8/9/2008 Sorry
I 'm late to the party on this , I just signed up for this site but I find the articles and commentary interesting .
Reagan the best of the 20th century ?
So if the Iran - Contra scandal and the support of ' freedom fighters ' ( aka right wing paramilitary groups across South America trained to torture and murder peasants indiscriminately , the taliban and other islamofascist organizations ) who would later be dubbed ' terrorists ' earns him the moniker of best of the 20th century , surely you can't think Bush is that bad ?
I agree with you on Bush and immigration however , I am generally probably considered ' liberal ' on most issues but as soon as 9/11 happened my first thought was not Iraq , Afghanistan or anywhere in the middle east , but rather our very own borders .
It still baffles me how even the most hardcore of conservatives can't see this issue right in front of their eyes , Bush giving amnesty to millions of illegals , presumably to keep the flow of cheap labor coming for his buddies running transnational corporations .
If national security and the safety of Americans at home were really his administrations concern , at least a quarter if not more of that money spent in Iraq should have been used on beefing up border security ( not just Mexico , coast guard and northern borders as well ) .
As far as global warming is concerned , enough scientists from the international community without any particular political agenda have backed up the science that is there enough for me to be convinced .
I know its oversimplifying things but if you put some people in a confined space filled with trees and start pumping it full of co2 and cutting down the trees faster than they can recirculate the oxygen , eventually there will be consequences as a result of this .
I know you did n't make this particular point but I just wanted to mention that I find the argument about " there has n't been an attack in six years since 9/11 so he should be praised for that " to be nonsense .
There was n't an attack on our soil for the 6 years prior to 9/11 , so who should get the credit for that ?
Even though you are clearly much more conservative than I , it seems we could probably both agree that Ron Paul would have been the best candidate to serve the interests of the American people .
I was beginning to believe there was n't a conservative left on the internet that I could find common ground with , good to know you 're not all as stubborn and arrogant as the Bush admin .
Robert M. Cerello - 8/6/2008
Instead of boring you with a lengthy disquisition on how very much I claim to know about constitutional marketplaces of citizens -- constitutional theory of societal associations of categorically equal citizens -- let me instead approach Mr. Bush 's record in three brief ways not covered by the author here nor by the other commenters .
( I. ) Unlike all other U.S. presidents before him , Mr. Bush admitted that he was NOT trying to be a president ; that he would use Kantian false headlines , deceptively labeled acts and " proposed laws " and falsified science , data , facts and testimony to sway disinformed public opinion ; and by floating a wildly radical hypothesis of secret imperial presidential powers -- extending to all those who ever whispered in the caesarean ear even when he was not listening to their advice -- Mr. Bush made it abundantly clear that :
1 . He was not going to be president of the U.S. but rather benevolent tyrannos -- sole " decider " .
2 . He was not willing to abide by constitutional regulations , permissions , duties and limitations placed upon the holder of the former office of elected " president " .
3 . His decisions were going to be made by means of mystical " religio " -- whispered instructions given to him from white - bearded deities , these mystical insights handed him from another universe -- and not as Abraham Lincoln put the case by means of decisions made " as God gives me to see ' the right " ...
( II . ) Mr. Bush and his cronies talk a lot about empowerment ; but for eight years they continued the disempowerment -- enslavement -- of individual rights - holding citizens , who now have no rights at all in the 3 main marketplaces of the empire .
1 . In the marketplace of goods and services Mr. Bush believes " he governs best who governs least " ; so he has dismantled all regulatory defining , regulation applying and oversight agencies ; his preference if carried out logically would exclude all regulations -- that being the " best " regulations by his irrational standard .
2 . In the marketplace of hiring and attainment of idea level leadership in jobs , Mr. Bush 's court has recently refused to hear " sole petitioner complaints " meaning the individual citizen , s unless he belongs to an approved collective no longer has the rights to life , liberty and the prioritized pursuit of personally satisfying non-criminal individual aims .
3 . In the marketplace of elective and appointive officer positions , he has refused to charter , reform or recognize a federal elections commission ; perhaps his reluctance to do so stems from his having been handed two elections via irregularities and neo - fascist tactics against politically - opposed voters in Florida , Ohio and several other states .
( III . )
Mr. Bush has nominated the public - interest lawmaking he pursues in the U.S. as " a nation of laws " , one not bound by liberal ethics :
" Concern with the rights and freedoms of the individual as opposed to any collective " ( dictionary definition ) .
By means of this extraordinary assertion , Mr. Bush has placed " law " as he defines it -- a presidential signing statement or enacted legislation , regulation etc .
into the category of " dictates : " orders announced by an infallible pseudo - religious annunciator as to what each man must say he believes or does n't believe , must do or refrain from doing , must agree to pay or agree to receive in order to avoid punishment by authorities who act against criminals . "
This un-American attitude -- the Declaration of Independence categorically states that " " governments are instituted among men , deriving their just power from the consent of the governed ; and that when any government becomes destructive of these ends ( securing individual liberty , selfish rights and pursuit of non-criminal happiness under regulated conduct " it shall be the right of the people ( governed ) to alter or abolish this constitution " .
Clearly , Mr. Bush has precisely violated the American purpose of the Constitution , substituting " final decider totalitarian inerrability " in his presidency for " securing rights to individual citizens by legal use of executive branch powers " .
For these reasons alone , along with pseudo -- religious pretensions , moral pretensions , ethical pretensions , the failure of every statue , program and activity ever deliberately undertaken by his administration 's officers , Mr. Bush stands accused of total failure , lying about his every intention , politicizing every department and function of government , seeking totalitarian powers for the presidency , blaming " government " for what was manifestly his and his illegal party 's deliberate betrayal of and refusal to work within the existing system of constitutional government .
When one adds Mr. Bush 's party 's use of swiftboating , the use of slander , false terminology , deliberate lies , character attacks , refusal to accept attested facts , refusal to deal through standards - based agreed - upon evaluations and a comprehensive war against category - level science , scientifically - gathered data and assembled facts , the reason for their failure as governors , moralists , ethicists and thinkers becomes self - evident : unrealism .
Postmodernism refers , I claim , to the substitution of whims , god-playing lies , fantasies , preferred versions -- anything and everything -- for the prioritized definition of real space - time , its workings , nature and conditions .
This is the unrealism Mr. \ Bush has perpetrated on his victims , the former citizens of a destroyed republic .
And it is for these activities that he should be considered in a micro-controlling dictator class formerly only imagined by Presidents Pierce , Buchanan and Polk in a technologically simpler
era .
And by these actions that he must be judged not merely " much the worst of all U.S. presidents " but indeed as " no president at all " - - a radical , pseudo - theocratic postmodernist benevolent dictator only pretending to be president in order to seize more totalitarian power for himself and the office that he has so profoundly ;y brought into question , denigrated and defiled .
His reinvasion of Iraq -- the onl ;y dictatorship in the NearEast whose enemies to us lacked power to attack to us -- was the worst and most chacarteristic blunder of his making .
But he used the false identification of " terrorism " with out p.r. contest in that dangerous region against pseudo - religious mass - murdering extremists as a target for military operations -- which it could never be , even though Iraq was the last place on planet we belonged at that time .
So we must add a-strategic stupidity of an unpralleled historic level to every area Mr. Bush has addressed during his shocking and immensely destructive regime of anti-thisworldly farce leading to inevitanle tragedy .
R.R. Hamilton - 7/24/2008
I have to admit that while I predicted from the beginning that Obama would throw his pastor under the bus to get elected , I did n't expect him to throw the DailyKosers and other nutroots under the bus quite so pre-emptively .
Plus he 's push Michelle to the back of the bus -- like leaving her at home while he goes globe - trotting .
As Obama punks his nutroot supporters and moves nearly to the Right of McCain on many of the issues ( admittedly easy to do ) , I think Obama 's prospects improve .
My old friend Bill Burton is doing quite a job .

Clyde Kenneth Clark - 7/15/2008
Too early ?
For what ?
How about all those lies George told us in order to justify the invasion of Iraq - a move that was condemned by the United Nations as being immoral and criminal !
Bush and LBJ are both from my state -
Texas and what that Dixie Chick said about Bush is nothing compared to what I have heard many Texans say about both Bush and LBJ for needlessly getting our country into no -win wars which kill millions .
What we need is an intelligent president who has no ego - fixations ( LBJ 's main problem ) or personal agendas ( Bush 's problem in re Iraq - Hussein ) .
Clyde Kenneth Clark - 7/15/2008
I thought Ronald Reagan was stupid but
George Bush has given stupidity a worse name than it previously had .
He
made the pre-emptive attack on Iraq ( fronted by that phoney Coalition that
he and his fellow conspirators cooked up ) in retaliation for Saddam Hussein ordering the murder of George 's daddy - Skip .
George 's lack of intelligence is equalled only by his absence of good character .
Jordan Galdo - 7/10/2008 A 9 trillion dollar debt , the failing American dollar ( in the gas costs relatively the same in GOLD ) , such low popularity that McCain is attempting to distance himself from Bush 's presidency in emphasizing his " Maverick " status , and of course Bush 's low popularity polls nation wide is all attributed to political bias ?
This is only the most obvious of the examples too , there is SO much one can pin on Bush that it 's hard to not accidentally trip over it .
If you want to see a TRUE conservative look at Ron Paul .
In Bush 's presidency the government has GROWN :
The patriot act is a good example of this .
I do not see how anyone that is not blinded by his " Republican " title could call him conservative in regards to government policies based off of his actual actions .
America should have followed George Washington 's advice and AVOIDED the travesty that is political parties , or at least followed the example of the majority of the world 's democracies in proportional representation to weaken over - strong political parties .
I swear that people are so blinded by partisanship that they would vote for a monkey if it were the Democratic / Republican nominee .

Diane de Reynier - 6/12/2008
Everyone is entiteld to an opinion , even historians .
Judging a car , every man has an opinion , though few really know how it works , but engeneers with university degrees .
Historians have that knowledge about what has happened in former times , and that gives a better base for understanding what is happening now .
They can better compare and have experience in that field .
Next to that common sense is a good idea for judging the results of 8 years of politics .
I am no historian , no American , retired .
Before Bush : we had problems with terrorists all over the world Ceylon , Germany , etc. Osama bin Laden was unknown .
Since Bush , with have WAR , WAR WAR on every thing , ( poverty , terrorism , Iraq , ....) and thanks to Bush , Osama bin Laden became so famous that he could increase greatly his influence .
And terrorists , no longer beeing treated as criminals , are now in the news all the time , getting a huge american publicity , that increases their power .
They are so lucky to have Bush .
After a terrorist attack , the British emphasize " business as usual " " we are not afraid " , but look at all the legislation to protect the Americans .
They must be so terribly afraid , could they be such cowards ?
Ready to give up all their democratic rights ...
Such people are no leader of the world .
And when you see day after day women and children killed by or because of the Americans , without proper water , kids without schooling , they will have no option and become terrorists .....
Then Bush was reelected though the Americans knew he lied and will lie to them .
So how about moral values ?
I judge politics by the results I see after 8 years : Americans after Bush look coward , stupid , immoral .
Before Bush they looked like friendly helpful successful people , fit to have a say in the world affairs .
It is such a waste and a pity .
But do stop saying it is " Bush " , in a democracy , all that happens in the name of every one American .
And so does the world judge .
China as the next leader will not be better , but at least intelliget .

ronald j gaudier - 6/8/2008 Good points .
However , I 'm not a historian .
Based soley on my own life experiences I can say without any doubt that GWB is the worst president of my lifetime .
And there have been some real losers the last 48 years .
Before Bush , I considered Carter to be the worst .
As bad as Carter was , at least he did not do as much damage as Bush .
LBJ was also pretty horrible , but at he had the honor to realize this and did not run a second term .
Bush on the other hand , believes that he has done nothing wrong .
This shows what a twisted personality he is .
Hopefully the people will learn a lesson from this .
Kevin R Kosar - 6/6/2008 #1
A methodological question :
How can historians , or anyone for that matter , come to an authoritative judgment of the competence of the sitting president ?
Sure , one might point to his actions or inactions on hot button policies and issues ( the Middle East , the environment , etc. ) that one reads about in the newspapers , but what of less well - known activities , like recent reforms of the federal rule - making process , or improvements in government procurement , or increased appropriations for arts education programs ?
The modern president heads the executive branch , a huge collection of agencies that pursues many , many policies on a bewildering range of issues .
Assessing him on a few but not the many others seems like cherry - picking .
yes , some issues , like war and peace , might be weighed more heavily than others .
But , some attention must be given to the very broad range of policies pursued if oen is going to try to form a judgment .
# 2 Related to this problem of comprehending and assessing the performance of a president , there is this challenge : How many historians have expertise in governance ?
How many are familiar with government management laws , the operations of OMB , the regulatory process , etc . ?
Probably few , in which case , who are they to assess the competence of a president ?
# 3 It is a fallacy to think that because one knows lots about one presidency ( FDR's , Chester A. Arthur's , etc. ) or American history generally that it makes one sufficiently expert to pass categorical pro/con judgments on the performance of other presidents , especially those who lived in very different times .
( Obviously , the presidency and the entire American political and governance context has evolved rapidly and dramatically .
Would George Washignton , a star in his time , have been a good President in the 1990s ?
It 's difficult to say . )
In short , to those who sit in their tenured chairs and toss off quick and categorical judgments , I suggest this : do your profession honor and please display some humility .
Cheers ,
Kevin R. Kosar

ronald j gaudier - 6/6/2008 " The President who made controversial decisions and stuck by them despite savage criticism "
And therein lies the problem .
The " Hubris " of George W Bush who no doubt believes that he receives divine guidance with his decisions .
I have never been more scared in my life !
Ricardo Luis Rodriguez - 6/4/2008
So much for detached scholarship .
The worst sin of modern academia is the delusion that " being engaged " is compatible with being objective .
ronald j gaudier - 6/2/2008
Do n't assume that all people who dislike George W Bush are " left wing member of the progressive blog sphere . "
I consider myself a Right leaning Libertarian ( former right wing Republican ) .
I believe that we would n't be facing the situation we are in politically ( Democrat control of house and likely the exectutive branch soon ) had not Bush been an unbelievably inept leader .
As I stated in my previous post , his positions on a number of issues including illegal immigration reform , are a major reason for my dislike of the man and a major reason why I consider him more like a Democrat than what the Republicans are supposed to be .
Daniel Ortner - 6/2/2008
While I dislike President Bush and his policies as much as the next left wing member of the progressive blog sphere , I think that this type of polling is a disgrace to the profession of history .
Polling on a sitting president reveals how swayed by popular sentiment historians truly are .
Indeed , I wonder how Truman would have ranked had this question been asked during the high point of the cold war .
It takes years and the light of retrospect to more accurately gauge a presidents impact .
ronald j gaudier - 6/1/2008
Let me preface this post by first stating that I had been ( until recently ) a life - long republican .
I still believe that Ronald Reagan was the best president of the 20th century ( not ever , that honor goes to George Washington ) .
I had misgivings about George W. Bush when he began his campaign for the Repuclican nomination .
When he described himself as a " compassionate conservative " that threw up a bunch of red flags .
Unforutunately , as has been the case for every predidential candidate I have voted for since Reagan , I felt compelled to choose the lesser of two evils ( or so I thought ) in George Bush .
Clearly , there is plenty of evidence supporting the assertion that GWB is the worst president ever .
And I agree with most of it ... with the exception of the climate change theory as I belive there is not anything humans can do to stop it .
However , there is one major ommission from what is being said here , and that is Bush 's position on ILLEGAL immigration .
While it was no surprise that he took the pro amnesty position , it was still a major disappointment and was basically the final straw for me as far as he was concerned .
I now no longer consider myself a Republican , but a conservative leaning Libertarian , and have become a card - carrying member of the Libertarian party .
I have found that many other conservatives feel the same way .
All but a few die - hard stubborn types that figure it is their patriotic duty to stand by their president no matter what .
While I cannot say with certainty that George W Bush is the worst president in history , I can say that he is without a doubt the worst in my lifetime .
Jonathan Maskevich - 5/22/2008
The first thing I was taught , in the first class I took in college was that there will always be bias in history , that we have to take particular care when examining primary documents , or other sources .
I do not see how this can be considered anything other than a political survey of people , who nearly all sit on the left , who happen to be historians .
This is n't History , and I am embarrassed to se it treated that way .
We are the most biased on this topic right now , we have zero objectivity , whether we are on the left , or on the right .
The historical study will come later .
This is nothing but Politics .
Mark Dixon - 5/22/2008
Well , hey !
The Man Made Global Warming " scientists " have been getting away with putting politics before science so , why not a handful of historians as well ?
Why worry about one 's credibility when there 's a Democrat to elect ?
It is true that history will judge George W. Bush .
But , it is also true that these " professional historians " will be judged as well .
We 'll see who comes out better in the end :
The President who made controversial decisions and stuck by them despite savage criticism ( both political and personal ) or the " professional historians " who allowed their personal politics to lead them to condemn a President even though that particular period of history was not yet over , in direct contradiction of their profession 's mandate of objectivity ?
Time will tell , wo n't it ?
Jonathan Reuel Seaver - 5/18/2008
You wo n't read it in reports from Associated Press or the national news media , but the impeachment of Bush and Cheney gained some momentum yesterday .
On a late afternoon vote of 110 - 88 , the N.H. Democratic Party convention supported a resolution to demand Congress impeach George W. Bush and Dick Cheney .
House Bill 24 will come off the table next Wednesday for a N.H. House of Representatives vote .
It is not too late for impeachment .
Congress could conduct a House impeachment investigation in November , conduct the U.S. Senate trial in December , and remove Bush and Cheney on the day before a new president and vice president are sworn into office .
George Shirey - 5/17/2008
If Bush is remembered as the worst president in history - it will only be because " historians " such as many of these posters have an incredibly biased view of what is good for America .
LBJ is admired and held on a pedestal by many " liberal historians " - but what are the results of his actions ?
Strong arguments can be made that though his intentions were good , the results of the " Great Society " have caused irrevocable damage to the American family .
The true legacy that Bush will be saddled with can not be known .
What we do know - he used all the American military might in a plan to create a forward battlefield in a war against an enemy that America has never faced before .
Whether that was a good move or bad will be judged by time , not by a bunch of " historians " who are caught in the current political mindset .

I always thought no one could dislodge Andrew Jackson from my number - one worst president ranking , but Bush has done it .
He beat out a president who ordered a genocide on American people .

Peter Gregory Wolfsehr - 5/9/2008
Just finished reading the HNN Poll : 61 % of Historians Rate the Bush Presidency Worst .
The piece provides some excellent assessments of the G W Bush performance .
My opinion ; Dubya is beyond merely rigidly ideological to the point of gross stupidity and profound incompetence .
It is as if he was hand picked by Osama to do as much damage to the US as possible , a veritable stooge of the man who hit us on 9/11 .
Think for a moment .
Has n't George done just about everything Osama would want him to do ?
Put our military through a pointless meat grinder , ruin the nation 's finances , destroy our reputation in the world , and on and on ?
My question ; why is n't the fraudulent use of the US military to perform a nation building / culture makeover experiment ( rather than for the traditional purpose of national defense ) an act of treason ?

joel menkes - 4/24/2008 Bad point .
In the case of judging a president you are gauging a unilateral program .
When rating congress you are gauging a bilaterally based negotiating body .
Rob Zenden - 4/20/2008
We do n’t know exactly yet how we will look to the Bush administration in the future .
But we can give already a good indication .
On international issues Bush will certainly be criticized for the way he treated terrorism and the war in Iraq .
Although we do n’t know how the future in Iraq will be , we now know already know that the war in Iraq is a complete failure .
It cost billions of dollars , thousands of American soldiers lives and a hundred thousand of civilian lives through ethnic violence .
When a war does n’t goes as planned historians will go back to the cause of the war .
Then they will see that the reasons to go to war were in the best sense incorrect or in the worst sense even real lies .
Then there is also the global warming issue .
From a president of world ’s must powerful nation a leading role may be expected .
But in fact this president did almost nothing .
The global warming challenge was ( alongside terrorism ) the largest challenge of the time of his presidency .
This president failed completely for the challenge of his time .
In other foreign affairs he ruined the image of the United States .
The way the world looks to the US has probably never been so bad as it is today .
On domestic affairs Bush will in the first place be judged on the economy .
What we do know is that Bush made a gigantic financial deficit and this lead to a dramatic decrease of the value of the US dollar .
We do n’t know how bad the current US economy is going to be .
In case the economic crisis is going to be really bad then he has failed both internationally and domestically completely .
Another important point is how low approval ratings among US population he receives .
Bush is certainly becoming one of the must unpopular presidents in history .
I think that Bush will certainly be considered as one of the worst presidents in US history .
He potentially could become THE worst of all .
Especially if the economic crisis is going to be a really bad one .
Rob Zenden - 4/20/2008
I think that George W. Bush will be remembered as one of the worst –if not the worst - US president in history .
What matters on the long term are especially crucial decisions about foreign policies and economic issues that matter .
To start with his decision to go to war in Iraq .
He went already to Iraq before having finished the job in Afghanistan .
He went into a war with the idea to make Iraq an example for the entire region .
This targets were completely unrealistic .
Secondly the costs of the war in terms of tax dollars as well as human lives were much higher then was useful .
And when a war goes not as planned , historians more then ever are going back to the question “ why did we go to war ? ” .
And the answer is that he went into a war without UN authoritization and based on arguments that later were proven simply false : weapons of mass destruction were never found and the direct link between Saddam Hussein and 9/11 also remains unproven .
Also very important for history is the fact if a president ( especially the president of world ’s must powerful nation ) meets the quests of his time .
A major quest of his time was to stop global warming .
From world ’s must powerful nation a leading role would be expected .
This president did almost nothing .
He did n’t even try .
So he simply failed for the quest of his time .
And then the economic issue .
Under his presidency the state deficit rise and rise , weakening the dollar further and further .
He ca n’t alone be blamed for the low value of the dollar , but he can be blamed for a great part because he allowed the state deficit to grow and grow .
On the short period a low dollar may be good for export , but on the long run it ’s very bad .
No foreign investors are going to invest in the US if they lose already 10 % a year on there exchange rates … .
And then the current economic crisis .
A lot of economists have warned already for years that both the state as well as civilians or companies were borrowing to much money .
Well , we have to wait how worse this crisis will be .
But some financial analysts ( including top economists ) have already argued that this might become the largest economic depression since the 1930’s .
In that case he as a president has also as a president completely failed on economic issues , probably even worse then any other president in history ( perhaps except Hoover ) .
Also the global warming issue and the Iraq war were both very bad for the image of the United States in the world .
Making diplomatic efforts much more difficult in the coming years .
The US is around the world not any more seen as the example of how a nation should be .
Foreign nations will become much more critical while negotiating with the US , while making it much more difficult for US in diplomatic efforts to reach it ’s goals .
My conclusion is that the next US president will not be able to start his own policy within the next years .
It will take years to repair what the previous president did .
The next president must repair the economy , the budget deficit , the crisis in Iraq , the global warming issue and the image of United States around the globe .
It will become a very difficult 4 years for the next president ….
R.R. Hamilton - 4/20/2008 Interesting contention .
How did you deduce this ?
( I 'm not disagreeing or agreeing -- just asking . )
Sara Marie Johnson - 4/19/2008
Clinton lied under oath about sexual harassment ; a major political accomplishment of the far left in making heterosexual sex illegal .
Bush , did not lie about Iraq .
You will find when you can actually study the real intellegence of the current events that Iraq shipped it 's weapons program to Syria .
Israel resently bombed the area where Sadam 's weapons were stored in Syria .
Being stupid of the facts does not constitute a historian 's judgement and you wo n't know the facts until they are declassified .
Therefore , you are no more than a propagandist pretending to be a historian .
Far Left political slogans are not history .
Embarassing for you if you are really a historian .
Sara Marie Johnson - 4/17/2008
Hopefully , the unprofessional and rude comments above have not come from real historians rather politicial operatives pretending to be historians .
Fred Merts - 4/17/2008
I 'm continually amazed that there are even a handful of supporters of George Bush .
Apart from attacking the wrong country , running up massive debt ( $ 3 trillion on his watch alone ) , outing a CIA agent ( then pardoning a dork named Scooter after saying the person responsible would be brought to justice ) .... doing massive harm to the environment .... Harriet Miers for the Supreme Court ??.... Rumsfeld .... torture ... alienation of our allies ....... New Orleans is still in shambles almost three years later ...... Holy Cow , I 've just scratched the surface !!!
Oh , another grand idea : Massive tax cuts for the rich and Big Oil -- then start a war and put it on the credit card for the kids to pay for , with massive , massive interest .
Nice job , Redneck .
And Redneckublicans will vote for four more years of this by voting John McSame -- more war , lower taxes for the rich .... and the dude is a fossil .
Will Senator
Hothead start a nuclear war , or just have a series of " senior moments " that impede his ability to make sound decisions .
So , we dig our country out of George 's mess .... with a reallllly old version of the current brainless one ?
God help us if it comes to pass .
All you Bush supporters that are part of the redneck agenda :
If you can not at least answer to any of the above , here 's an easy one for you :
How can this yokel / buffoon even be taken seriously , let alone respected , if he does n't even have command of the English language ?
Y'all must cringe every time George butchers the English language .
Perhaps you do not notice , which would explain a lot .
This guy has been a failure at every turn of his life , and even Daddy Bush has been said to be privately distraught and embarrassed with what his mentally - challenged son has done to the once - great USA ( the family wanted the smarter one , Jeb , to ascend to the presidency ) .
The only people dumber than George are the people who voted him in .
R.R. Hamilton - 4/16/2008 Germany , France , and Italy are , with Britain , the the biggest countries in Western Europe .
That the voters there would rise up and oust the anti-Bush cabals shows as a lie the contention that " Bush has made America hated around the world " .
The only people in Europe who hate America in 2008 are the same ones ( or their political descendants ) who hated us in 1978 , 1988 , and 1998 .
Paul Mocker - 4/16/2008 3 countries in Europe out of how many ?
25 or so ?
scott ryley - 4/16/2008
There is greater unity in Europe .
There is still much more progress needed in the global war on terrorism .
The United Nations has done little in its capacity to address world issues of terrorism , poverty and genocide .
The U.S.A has filled the role of this world body .
Security is a price to be paid by all , not some !
As a country , we should re-examine all of our relationships and make necessary changes
Old Sarg - 4/15/2008
What I find so outrageous about you " unscientific " polling is the one sided flavor .
It seems more of a Cuban polling than a polling in a free country .
Has the Government also taken away your right to be objective ?
John C O'Connor - 4/15/2008 Pawl442 ,
" But worst of all are the 1 MILLION PLUS INNOCENT DEAD IRAQI'S .
Does the number have to be 6 million before its called what it is , genocide , and to be compaired to Hitler ? "
Where do you get your numbers ?
Iraqi's not Americans are doing the vast majority of the killing in Iraq .
You casually throw around the term genocide to simply sate your political bias just like " torture " was applied to the pictures of prisoners wearing underwear on their heads .
What you 're doing through your ignorance is cheapening the meaning and insulting those true victims of torture and genocide .
John C O'Connor - 4/15/2008 Ditto
Well done Maarja !
John C O'Connor - 4/15/2008
Me too , right after the French war crimes in Algeria , Russia 's countless war crimes , China 's Tibetan war crimes , Spains civil war crimes , etc ...
Grow up !!!
John C O'Connor - 4/15/2008
Do you sell those crystal balls on eBay ?
John C O'Connor - 4/15/2008
Peter perhaps you should take your own advice .
The only reason the Iraqi people were injured by the sanctions was because Saddam " the rightful ruler of Iraq " was hording the " oil for cash " dollars and doling out projects to the Germans , French , Russians & Chinese .
Who by the way were preparing to help lift the sanctions and support " the rightful ruler of Iraq " in his self admitted pursuit of WMD's .
Take off your Hate Bush blinders and get the facts before you criticize !!
Evgueni Khanine - 4/15/2008
" There is no question in my mind , from years and years of this banter , that people are much more likely to be on the left who lose their temper and sputter personal insults than on the right . "
Hmm , let 's see .
Rush Limbaugh , Michael Savage , Bill O'Reilly have never lost their temper , have never insulted anyone , have never yelled at anybody ?
Or are they at " the tavern level " ?
Sara Marie Johnson - 4/15/2008
I am not so sure Bush " picked " the wrong country to attack .
He needed to collect intellegence on the Islamic terrorist network and Sadam was a great target for the US , strategically .
Sadam gassed his own people , was playing games with the UN arms inspectors and tried to kill the President 's mom and dad in Kuwiat .
Iraq is a good staging area to take on Iran in case the nuts carry through on their threat to nuke the US and Isreal .
In addition I would like to remind everyone that the " historians " are , in the majority , left wing political activists .
Remember when they went to bat for Clinton claiming it is not unusual for Presidents in history to be sexual active outside their marriages ; made a flase claim that George Washington fathered the children of slaves while totally ignoring the little fact that Clinton 's impeachment was brought on by him committing perjury , not getting blow jobs from his intern .
History is supposed to be based on facts , not political spin , but we know differently after the " historian 's " Clinton fiasco .
Most American historians are nothing more than airburshers of history blessing one another 's artistic talents .
I am a fortune teller !
I can see in the future that the next Republican president will be pronounced the worst president ever by America 's " historians . "
If O'Bama or Hillary are elected , they will be pronounced the very best of the best Presidents in US hisory !
R.R. Hamilton - 4/15/2008
I forgot to mention :
My 15 - year - old did not , as I mistakenly reported earlier , get 2 /3rds correct ; she got only about 3/5 ths correct .
Still , under my suggested standard ( minimum 1/2 correct ) , that would be enough for her to vote -- until we implement my property - owning requirements . :)
I think if a 15 - year - old kid can pass , the standard is n't too tough .
Nevertheless , I will be agreeable to lowering the bar to 1/3 correct :
That 's right , you have to get 20 of 60 correct answers on what amounts to being a " good citizenship test " .
Is that too much to ask ?
R.R. Hamilton - 4/15/2008
For many years I 've said that I would support any voting restrictions -- based on some reasonable combination of scholastic and economic accomplishments -- that would disenfranchise me .
Unfortunately , at this stage of my life that 's probably impossible -- such restrictions now would leave only five - or ten - thousand people eligible to vote .
Even I agree with William F. Buckley 's sentiment that we would be better off governed by the first 200 names in the Boston phonebook than by the faculty of Harvard .
( His remark echoes every time I visit the eggheads here at HNN.us )
As far as " political participation is an inalienable right " , I think you go too far .
On a purely practically level , I think most Americans would agree with me .
If we asked them , Which would you rather have : the right to vote or the right to drive ?
I think 98 % would choose the right to drive .
On a theoretical level , I find it strange that people who have no problem acknowledging necessary restrictions on capitalism or on property development -- and even on democracy ( so that it does n't become a tyranny of the majority ) -- have this sentimental attachment , which Obama might even call " clinging " , to the notion of unfettered universal franchise .
Did you know that on Election Day , operatives from both parties will be combing the lunatic asylums of America fishing for votes ?
Those provisions in your state constitution or statutes barring voting by " insane persons " have been held to apply only to persons actually adjudicated as insane -- something that applies to only a tiny fraction of the asylum inmates .
Are you comfortable knowing that your vote will be cancelled out by the half - nod of a guy in a strait - jacket ?
I 'm not .
If I could , I would also revive the " King 's Shilling " rule , which would prevent voting by government employees and contractors -- and wards .
That 's common sense , like the rule in most company lotteries and contests that bars participation by company employees .
I think voting is too important and -- especially given the scope of government today -- too potentially dangerous to be unprotected from the incompetent and the vested insiders .
R.R. Hamilton - 4/15/2008
This article has been highlighted by U.S. News and World Report : http://www.usnews.com/articles/news/politics/2008/04/11/the-first-draft-of-history-looks-a-bit-rough-on-bush.html
Read the comments to see how bad it is viewed .
On a lighter note , the article says that , " Among the reasons given for his low ratings : invading Iraq , ' tax breaks for the rich , ' and alienating many nations around the world . "
Notice that Berlusconi was re-elected ?
Is n't that a clean sweep for Bush ?
France , Germany , Italy -- every anti-Bush candidate has been swept from office .
So much for " alienating " anyone in foreign countries except the effete elites .
Jonathan Dresner - 4/15/2008
We do n't even have literacy requirements for elected officials : it would be rather hypocritical to require higher qualifications for voters .
Seriously , though , political participation is an inalienable right : like speech , association , religion , etc. , it should only be abridged for good cause .
It 's not earned , but is part and parcel of citizenship .
( p.s. I missed three , for a 95 % score , all in the " market " category .
One of the answers is debateable ; one is technical , and one , while legitimate , requires more detail than basic civic literacy .
If I was unsure , I just picked the answer most likely to make a hard - core conservative happy ....
There 's some decent questions there , and some deeply flawed ones . )
scott ryley - 4/15/2008
The reinvestment act of 1977 was the groundwork for further reform in 1989 .
Your point has merit seeing oversight was deficient in leading up to this housing market crisis .
It gives credence to the saying we do n't need new laws just enforcement of the ones we have .
Note on the EIC is that both the President and Congress signed and approved these increases .
Paul Mocker - 4/15/2008 Has
Bush been responsible for increased benefits of the EIC for the working poor ?
Also , is he also responsible for audit rates of the working poor - EIC recipients being higher than audit rates for the rich ?
R.R. Hamilton - 4/14/2008
My point was n't that approval polls are particularly helpful in gauging effectiveness ; it was quite the opposite .
R.R. Hamilton - 4/14/2008
Point taken : a handful ( 3 or 4 , IIRC , out of 8 or 9 fired U.S. attorneys ) of U.S. attorneys were fired last year at least in part for failing to pursue , vigorously enough for the administration and its friends in Congress , allegations of voter fraud .
As far as allegations of Republican or " voting machine companies ( presumptively GOP ! ) " voter fraud , if you have strong circumstantial evidence of it , then you should forward it to the Democratic leaders in Congress so they can demand investigations .
Do n't be too disappointed if they take no action ; Democrats do n't have a history of being particularly wary of voter fraud .
( There is an interesting give - and - take on this matter at http://balkin.blogspot.com/2007/05/us-attorney-scandal-in-nutshell-upshot.html)
Btw , for the record , I prefer paper ballots , not punchcards , touch - screens or any similar system .
And just as important is making sure the ballots remain undisturbed during their transfer from the polling stations , where they are marked , to the county clerk 's offices , where they are counted .
A lot of elections can be decided during the trip to the courthouse with the help of an icepick and a handful of punchcards .
Now , what did you think about my idea to return literacy requirements for voters ?
How about we use this test from the Intercollegiate Studies Institute : http://www.americancivicliteracy.org/
I think if one can't get at least half of the questions there correct , one has no business be honored with a voter 's registration card ( think of it like a driving test for a driver 's license ) .
My 15 - year - old got 2/3rds correct .
Jonathan Dresner - 4/14/2008
Vigorous attempts by the Bush administration to prosecute Democrats for voter fraud generally failed , resulting in -- you may remember this -- the dismissal of otherwise competent and loyal Republican US Attorneys .
Voter fraud by Republican elected officials and voting machine companies has yet to be properly investigated , but there is strong circumstantial evidence .
Jonathan Dresner - 4/14/2008
There 's a well - documented , though admittedly odd , tendency for people to rate institutions like Congress poorly in the abstract and collective , but to view their own representatives as exceptional and exceptions .
Opinion polls of Congress as a collective are fundamentally meaningless , in terms of gauging political realities .
R.R. Hamilton - 4/14/2008
You say , " It actually seems quite likely that the 2000 and 2004 elections featured unprecedented levels of vote - rigging and fraud " .
This is probably true , but irrelevant as Bush won despite Democratic vote - rigging and fraud .
If you want " well - informed , competent , [ and ] interested in merit " , bring back the literacy requirement for voting .
But that would rob the Democratic Party of its strongest voting bloc .
R.R. Hamilton - 4/14/2008
Then with Congress ' " lower than Bush " approval ratings , it 's past time for mainstream historians to pronounce Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid " Worst Ever Congressional Leaders " .
R.R. Hamilton - 4/14/2008 ... for providing the exact figures on the House vote on the Iraq War Resolution .
I was trying to avoid the appearance of pedantry .
Will Riley - 4/14/2008
It seems as though there is a bias against all bias , but bias is not always bad .
Bias indicates a preference for one thing versus another .
Bias indicates a value .
Many historians are for example are biased for citing their sources .
Many people are biased against murder .
We need to careful to distinguish between liberal bias and bias against certain kinds of political action .
We need to be careful to not throw out the baby with the bath water .
Many of the historians are biased against many of the actions taken by the Bush administration .
They are ranking the presidents based on the combination of all of their biases .
The question is not whether they have liberal bias , but whether their liberal bias is compatible with many our most fundamental and shared biases .
I think that many of these discussions devolve into a back - and - forth about how one side is basically correct , and the other is basically wrong .
Usually , both sides are basically wrong , often on different points .
I think that bias , in general , is not the problem .
Without bias , we would have no basis for dispute .
What we must do to win an argument , is appeal to our most basic biases , those that every side of the issue is clearly committed to .
I often feel that liberal bias is present in academia .
My reaction is not to immediately discount the bias , but to press it to account for its bias .
There may be justification for that bias .
I would like to introduce one final thought :
Is it possible that both Clinton and Bush are terrible presidents , but in different ways ?
Yes .
Is it possible that while both are terrible presidents , Bush is substantially worse than Clinton .
Yes , that is possible .
Why is n't this possibility vigorously discussed ?
Why are there only two opposing sides to this complex issue ?
There must be more perspectives out there .
Will Riley - 4/14/2008
As an American citizen , I too would like to see George W. Bush , Donald Rumsfeld , Condi Rice , and Dick Cheney stand before an international war crimes tribunal .
R.R. Hamilton - 4/14/2008
Only if by " the Iraqi people " you mean only " Saddam and his family " .
I read in last week 's TIME magazine ( not exactly a bastion of conservatism ) that Iraqis are praying for a McCain victory .
mary ann wator - 4/14/2008 " Bush 's reasons for invading Iraq were grounded in flimsy and fraudulent intelligence .... links to Al Quaeda , and so forth ) .
This is beyond debate . "
Apparently you , like the media , have not read the additonal transcribed Iraqi documents ..... yes , proving again that the president WAS RIGHT !
mary ann wator - 4/14/2008 Exact
House vote count - 296 yea ; 133 Nay .
Republicans : 215 yea ; 6 nay .
Democrats : 81 yea ; 126 nay .
mary ann wator - 4/14/2008 " Now Republicans do n't want to vote for someone who might be smarter than them " ?
It was the media that created the perception of Obama , an inexperienced nobody , a junior attorney , pulled from the backroom record room , with ONE appearance only defending a case in front of a judge , part - time college lecturer .... why did a supposedly " so smart " high achiever in law school , settle for the unknown but simply a friend 's law firm ?
SIMPLE !
His short life as an " organizer " ( glorified Democrat vote getter ) before law school , introduced him to his best buddy , indicted Tony Reszko , Allyson Davis ( Obama 's law firm boss ) , William Ayers , former terrorists , Rev. Wright , of the God D** America fame , and the Daley Machine ... all taught him where the easy money is and always will be , who and how to get elected and fit into the guaranteed easy life of corrupt Democrat Chicago politics .
Get a law decree and leave the rest to us and the Chicago media !
Do what we say and he did ...99 % liberal voting record , constant paybacks to all friends !
It is the same media who now excuses Obama 's questionable friends , miscues , lies , experience and lack of judgment and never questions Obama 's fairy tale books of " poor " and victimization .
This is the same liberal media and elite educated close - minded snobs who created the Bush image from before he was elected ...." stupid " , " moron " , etc .
All are simply biased liberals , of " one mind " " group thinking " only ( anti-conservatism ) .... never ever even considering an alternate view ?
An education without common sense , without love of America , without leadership ability , without experience , does not make for presidential qualifications !
By the way , I lived through many generations of presidents ... Johnson , foul - mouthed cowboy Texan and the Vietnam war ... Truman , a simple man without oratory skills who atom - bombed the hell out of Japan ... JFK , a great speaker , but if he lived now , would be a Republican , and then Reagan , described by the liberal media as " stupid " , " ignorant " , " just another cowboy " ...... " education " never a question .
The supposed " historians " at the time these presidents left office , declared all failures ???
Who 's " delusional " ?
mary ann wator -
4/13/2008 800,000 Rwandan 's massacred in a short 6 months while the Democrat administration sat back debating " is it genocide or not " ???
The lack of a strong response from the Democrat administration after the attack on WTC in ' 92 and the numerous attacks on Americans throughout the 90s , only strengthened the al Queda 's resolve to attack America on 9/11 .???
With the huge Gorelick wall imposed on the various intelligent agencies resulting in an inability to talk to each other ... all involved agree it would have been impossible to stop any attack , as far as time , date , etc .
WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE ????
Prior to America 's attempt to liberate Iraq , there were decades of proven genocide in Iraq while America sat back and ignored it , but especially CNN who was in Iraq witnessing it but because of an agreement with Hussein did not report it ...???
All international intelligent agencies agreed there were WMDs in Iraq and ongoing programs ....
American soldiers were NEVER targeting civilians ... the majority of Iraqi deaths were caused intentionally by al Queda and terrorists who used women and children as shields , schools , hospitals and mosques as bases , and till this day encourage their young to be suicide bombers while strapping the mentally challenged with bombs .
You 're so concerned with Iraqi and American " numbers " now ... where were you when 4000 Americans were killed in ONE battle during WWII or a final total of 400,000 , or 54,000 Americans lost in the Vietnam war ???
Freedom never comes cheap and victory and Democracies do not occur overnight .
Peace comes only through strength , but this generation of liberal historians ( glorified overpaid professors ) teach the exact opposite .
Obviously , they 'll also judge one of the most courageous and strong president " their " way ... as you did with your simplistic liberal talking points that have been repeated for five years .
R.R. Hamilton - 4/13/2008
But since you say " the housing crisis is market related " , the only thing I would ask you to consider is the impact of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 on it .
R.R. Hamilton - 4/13/2008
You say , " You want to gripe about what a school newspaper ad says about strippers and drinking .
I interpreted the ad's message correctly , but that 's neither here nor there . "
First , I have already established , indisputibly , for the record that the ad said nothing about " strippers and drinking " .
Why do you keep raising this bullshit ?
Second , if you have an interpretation of the ad that makes if seem more benign than it seems to the rest of mankind , you should 've informed Duke 's lawyers before they sprayed tens of millions of dollars ( my estimate ) at the indicted players .
It is clear that Duke would rather spend almost any amount of money rather than see the authors of the Ad up on the witness stand , under oath , in public , trying to defend their ... creation .
Now as for the " historians " who have already pronounced Bush " the worst ever " :
Have these " historians " never heard of Buchanan ?
Or Hoover ?
Apparently not -- or maybe they consider the failure to prevent an American Civil War or a Great Depression pretty small potatoes compared with whatever Bush has done .
I could probably name 10 - 20 other Presidents who are at least debateably worst than Bush ; but for Buchanan and Hoover , how can there be a debate ?
Ipso facto , Bush can not be the " worst president ever " for anyone who can be seriously called a historian .
R.R. Hamilton - 4/13/2008
You say , " A majority of Democrats in Congress shared his views and voted to authorize the invasion of Iraq , both in the House and Senate . "
I believe this is incorrect with respect to the House .
I think the House Democrats voted roughly 3:2 AGAINST the Iraq War Resolution .
In the Senate , the vote ( of Dems ) was 29 - 21 in favor .
What I find most interesting is that of the Dem Senators up for re-election that year , the vote was 16 - 1 .
scott ryley - 4/12/2008
It is to soon to properly evaluate the outcome of various policies over the past 8 years .
It can be said that Europe has changed its position regarding the fight against terrorism .
Europe is beginning to realize the global stategy requires all free nations have this great responsibilty , not just the U.S.A .
Forign policy issues are very complex .
Homeland security has its faults but has provided a greater security to the country since 9 - 11 .
Issues with the middle east , Russia , Europe and China have led to a greater polarization on very sensitive issues .
This chapter still remains unwritten .
Domestic policies and there results are still inconclusive .
There is improvement in the education standards of many schools , taxes for ALL brackets have been reduced ; including increases in Earned Income Credit for the poor .
The housing crises is market related and will correct itself both by the governments prodding of lenders to reach out to more troubled borrowers and tax incentives to lessen the real estate inventory .
It must be said that the government has done a good job in guiding the markets through this difficult period .
Inflation and failure of the U.S.A. to develope a comprehensive energy policy over the past 40 years will be a problem for years to come .
There has been a failure to control spending and therefore have added to the dollars global deprciation .
The Iraq war is draining the budget much has the Vietnam war did 40 years ago .
In conclusion , we are many years away from writing the final summary of the Bush presidency .
John Williams - 4/12/2008 on this subject wherein he regurgitates liberal political talking points , I think it more fitting to consider him a political operative than a historian .
His observations offer little in the way of objective analysis of actual policies ( as do the observations of his " poll respondents " ) .
I see this as little more than a political hit job on President Bush with little to no historical value whatsoever ( aside from the irrational , pathological hatred Bush has generated among liberals in academia ) .
William J. Stepp - 4/12/2008
Far from ending the Cold War , Truman actually began it with the Truman Doctrine , national security institutions , containment , and economic and military aid to Greece and Turkey .
He was n't the worst president in history , just the fourth or fifth worst .
R.R. Hamilton - 4/12/2008
If " Americans have become so complacent and inept when it comes to US history " , what does that say about American historians ?
I ask this as someone who got a perfect score on a American history test linked from HNN a couple of months ago .
Alan Henessy - 4/12/2008 Mark
Twain said :
There are liars , there are damned liars , then there are statisticians .
You spin those numbers in such a way that an amateur may actually buy into you cooky theory about Harry Truman winning th Cold War .
By that acount I 'd say that Taft won the World War II .
Your basic concern is about the distribution of income - which I grant , is important .
However , your characterization of Bush presidency as a mini - dark age is nonsense .
Were the last 8 years worse than LBJ or Carter presidency , or certain periods of Reagan and Bush Sr ?
The answer is patently " no " .
Thanks to Bush policies , the economy recovered from Sept 11 , 2001 slide .
The Dow went from 6,000 to 12,000 .
Come on , be a little fair to the facts .
Tim M Kane - 4/12/2008
As it is , Bush 's reputation , for what it is , is being held up by the power of his office and the ability to cower journalist .
Once that power is gone , his reputation will collapse .
Then as more information comes out , like the recent admission concerning torture , Bush 's reputation will get worse and worse .
Then there is the prospect of Bush 's term in office being bookended by Clinton 's spectacular tenure , and perhaps and even more monumental Obama or Hillary presidency .
His could easily be seen as the crater presidency or ' mini dark - age ' presidency .
Stephen Lang - 4/12/2008
Seriously , Bush is awful , but what kind of context are we talking about when Americans have become so complacent and inept when it comes to US history ?
Rating his the worst of the modern US presidents might be more appropriate .
Carl A Willis -
4/12/2008 > Many intellectuals do have poor judgment
All I was pointing out was that this provincial " Ad of 88 " that you 're fixated upon does n't support a sweeping conclusion about historians or academics , their collective bad judgment , their " alternative universe " or whatever , and ( more apropos to this thread ) their supposed fallacy in ranking Bush 's presidency poorly .
Look at the elements of your case :
You need to show ( A ) that this Duke ad does in fact demonstrate bad judgment or a disconnect from reality on the part of its faculty authors ; ( B ) that those particular 88 faculty are somehow representative of professional historians generally ; and ( C ) that , given an instance of bad judgement in ( A ) , ANY position taken by a group of historians will also be bad judgment .
You want to gripe about what a school newspaper ad says about strippers and drinking .
I interpreted the ad's message correctly , but that 's neither here nor there .
I 'd like you to try to make your case by arguing ( A ) , ( B ) , and ( C ) above .
That would be entertaining for me , because it 's a patently ludicrous trajectory of logic .
Most folks would n't come up with that unless they 'd imbibed a great deal of bongwater .

Tim M Kane - 4/12/2008
Bush 's economic performance is hardly laudable .
The economy grew , but only the top 10 % got any benefit out of that growth .
Median family income has consistently declined over every year he has been in office .
And that growth would not have happened without Bush borrowing over a trillion dollars from China .
I 'm not sure borrowing money can truly be called growth .
Second , Bush will be the only president to have two recessions .
Third , under Clinton the economies growth , in % and in absolute terms , is unprecedented for eight years - 50 % !
You can't view Bush outside that .
The cold war was won by Harry Truman - he created the strategy and the institutions .
Even Eisenhower , in 1954 predicted that the Soviet empire would fall apart in 4 or 5 decades .
So give Eisenhower the credit for giving Truman the credit .
Reagan merely sped things up by a decade .
Perhaps his most notable acheivement was the PATCO strike .
This effectively undermined labor .
This contributed to disproportionate distribution of wealth - the very condition that caused the collapse of : Ancient Egypts New Kingdom , Western Roman Empire , Pre-Islamic Mecca ( Islam in fact is a reaction to wealth concentration there ) , Eastern Roman Empire , medieval Japan ( causing a multi- centuried dark age ) , Hapsburg Spain , Bourbon France , Romanov Russia , Coolidge - Hoover America ( contributing to the collapse of Wiemar Germany , the rise of Hitler , WWII , the Holocaust ) .
The distribution of wealth has been a problem with this country eversince the creation of the limited liability corporation during the Civil War years .
Collective bargaining was one solution .
Reagan should go down in history for undermining those institutional arrangements , without replacing anything new .
As a result , the economy has doubled its productivity since 1980 , but median family income is roughly the same .
Arguably , then , if and when America collapses , as a result of concentrated wealth , as all great societies have in the past , it will be largely because of Reagan on the one hand and Bush II on the other .
History is still out on this .
We may find a new organizational arrangement to replace unions ( as Japan has , giving them the broadest economic distribution among any large economy ) .
Iraq , a nation whose GNP in 2002 was only $ 52 billion has cost us over $ 1 trillion , and if we began packing up today , Stiglitz suggest the total bill will come to $ 2 trillion .
If we had dumped a half trillion of reasonably well managed aid into Afghanistan , we would be in much better shape and Bin Laden would be behind bars .
Bush 's place in history will get worse if the country never recovers or if a Democrat comes along and restores a reasonable , rational distribution of wealth , causing demand to return and the economy sky rocket .
Stuck between Clinton and Clinton , or Clinton and Obama , the Bush years will be known as ' the crater ' presidency or perhaps , the ' mini - dark age ' : given its looting , war and torture practices .
I can't think of any likely scenario that would make Bush look good .
It 's not even a questionable call .
Really .
Tax cuts and wars are oxymorons that only a moron would pursue .
This is n't rocket science , or ideology .
It 's just common sense and remedial level of civics .
In fact , only ideology makes you blind to the facts .
Tim M Kane - 4/12/2008
Another point in the Buchanon v Bush as the worst president is the context of what they inherited .
The slavery and succession issue was a problem bigger than any one presidency , that he had inhereted .
In fact , the problem had been kicked down the road into his administration , where it came to a head .
Perhaps a better man might have handled the situation better than Buchanan did , but the problems he faced would have baffled most pedestrian presidents .
Regardless , Buchanan did not create the situation , he merely did not handle it well .
Also , succession was only one issue .
In a sense , the climate issue is similar to Bush 's situation .
He inherited that , but his policies have ignored science .
This is hard to believe .
Bush , also inherited a country at its peak .
Not just any peak either , but history 's peak , for any country , anywhere and any time .
Second , he did n't have to be brilliant .
Clinton warned him that Terrorism should be his top priori

WARREN , Mich ( Reuters ) - Three former chairmen of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama on Wednesday , bolstering the Illinois senator ’s economic credentials and bipartisan appeal as he closes in on his party ’s nomination .

Former SEC head William Donaldson , who was appointed by Republican President George W. Bush , joined Arthur Levitt and David Ruder in backing Obama , who leads rival Hillary Clinton in the number of delegates necessary to become the Democratic White House nominee .
Levitt was appointed by former President Bill Clinton , a Democrat , while Ruder was appointed by former President Ronald Reagan , a Republican .
All three commended Obama for his approach to regulation .
“ Each of us has been committed to prudent economic policy and effective financial regulation for many years , ” they said in a joint statement along with former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker , also an Obama supporter .
“ We believe Senator Obama can provide the positive leadership and judgment needed to take us to a stronger and more secure economic future . ”
In the statement they praised Obama ’s “ reasoned approach ” in analyzing “ the current financial crisis and the need for balanced regulatory reform . ”
“ We believe that such a constructive approach can be extended broadly in the economic area as well as elsewhere , ” they said .
REGULATION
Obama has distinguished his economic policies from Clinton , a New York senator , and Republican candidate John McCain , an Arizona senator , in recent weeks by opposing a reprieve on a gasoline tax over the upcoming summer months .
On Tuesday , he compared conditions during the Great Depression to the current U.S. housing crisis , blaming both in part on poor financial regulation .
He has promised better regulation of mortgage lenders and other financial institutions .
Donaldson , who led the SEC for about 18 months during Bush ’s administration , repeatedly aligned himself with two Democratic commissioners to adopt new rules regulating hedge funds and mutual funds .
Investors welcomed his activism when the Enron and WorldCom scandals were unfolding , but the business community opposed his initiatives .
Donaldson , the founder of Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette and former chief executive of Aetna Inc , also helped get the new Sarbanes - Oxley corporate reform law underway and steered an agency crackdown on companies that broke securities rules .
Obama said he would work with his new backers to fight the nation ’s economic ills .
“ I am honored to have the support of such a distinguished group of financial leaders , ” he said in a statement .
“ They understand the depth of our current economic problems and that we need to rise above the old politics if we are to build a stronger , more secure economic future .
I look forward to working with them to achieve that goal . ”

WASHINGTON  As President Bush welcomed the Federal Reserve ’s sweeping intervention in the financial markets , his administration faced accusations Monday that it supported the bailout of a prestigious investment bank while doing little to address the hardships faced by Americans facing foreclosures on their homes .
After conferring with his economic aides at the White House in the morning in the first of two meetings on the turmoil , Mr. Bush again sought to project optimism at a time of financial turbulence following the Fed ’s brokering of the takeover of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase .
He singled out Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. for praise , saying that he had shown “ the country and the world that the United States is on top of the situation . ”
“ I want to thank you , Mr. Secretary , for working over the weekend , ” Mr. Bush said .
The president ’s remarks and his schedule underscored the growing political concern about the economy on a day that would otherwise have been devoted to traditional St. Patrick ’s Day meetings and events .

The United Nations has suspended food aid to 650,000 Palestinian refugees in the Gaza Strip after it ran out of fuel for its delivery vehicles .
At the request of the UN Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) , distributors sent an emergency tanker to the Nahal Oz terminal through which Israel transfers petrol and diesel , but it was turned back by 1,500 farmers protesting that they needed fuel just as urgently .
The driver was held for three hours , and then forced to return empty .
Palestinian distributors have been on strike for the past four weeks , demanding that Israel step up supplies and guarantee a steady flow .
Both sides agree that storage tanks on the Gaza side of the terminal are full , with stocks of up to 1 million litres of fuel .
But Mahmoud Khozendar , the distributors ' vice - chairman , said that was only enough to meet three or four hours ' demand .
They needed at least 10 times as much as Israel was prepared to deliver .
" If we bring the fuel it would be very dangerous for us , " he claimed .
" People would fight over who should get it first .
Filling stations would be destroyed . "
Last night Hamas proposed a six - month cease - fire with Israel , saying the Gaza Palestinian group would stop firing rockets into the Jewish state if Israel lifts its blockade of the coastal strip at the same time , Egypt 's state run Mena news agency reported .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The report came after a day of closed - door meetings between Egypt 's powerful intelligence chief Omar Suleiman , who has been mediating between Hamas and Israel , and Hamas ' strongman , Mahmoud Zahar .
Under the international boycott imposed after Hamas seized Gaza by force last June , Israel 's declared policy has been to allow in enough fuel , food and medical supplies to keep people alive , but not enough for them to live well .
Local journalists report that bakeries and snack bars are closing for want of fuel .
The roads are almost empty .
Motorists who converted their cars to drive on cooking gas are running out of that too .
John Ging , director of the UNRWA in Gaza , said : " People are desperate .
Everybody needs fuel .
If the farmers can't get fuel , they can't pump water to irrigate their crops .
About 70,000 people are without water in their homes ; 25 per cent are getting water once every four days because of electricity cuts .
All the hospitals are below the critical mark in their fuel resources .
" The laundry service in Gaza 's biggest hospital has been reduced by 50 per cent , with all the unhygienic consequences .
Teachers have no fuel to drive to their schools .
It 's not the distributors ' responsibility to decide between hospitals and municipalities , or whether a doctor should get fuel . "
Israel responded by accusing Gaza 's de facto Hamas government of " fabricating " a crisis for political purposes .
Aryeh Mekel , the Foreign Ministry spokesman , alleged that Hamas had sent the protesting farmers to block UNRWA 's shipment .
" Three weeks ago we sent in one million litres of fuel , " he said .
" Hamas refuses to take it in order to create an artificial so - called humanitarian crisis .
They are trying to break the so - called blockade .
They have enough fuel to meet all the humanitarian needs . "
The spokesman insisted that Israel wanted to send more , but could n't because the tanks were already full .
He blamed earlier disruptions on security concerns .
On 9 April , Palestinian mortar shells killed two Israeli civilian workers at the Nahal Oz terminal .
Last Saturday , Hamas suicide bombers wounded 13 Israeli soldiers at the Kerem Shalom humanitarian aid terminal .
Robert Serry , the UN special coordinator for the Middle East peace process , accused Israel on Wednesday of collective punishment , but also urged Hamas to end all attacks against the crossings .
" These attacks endanger both international and Israeli civilians , and cannot possibly contribute to Palestinian efforts to ease the blockade of Gaza , " he said .
Hamas leaders have called for Gazans to march on the two passenger terminals out of Gaza , the Erez crossing into Israel and the Rafah crossing to Egypt , after Friday prayers today to protest at the continuing siege .
They stopped short of ordering them to break down the barriers as they did at Rafah in January .
At the UN in New York , the United States , Britain and France walked out of a closed meeting of the Security Council after Libya compared the situation in Gaza to Nazi concentration camps .
The council 's South African president , Dumisani Kumalo , closed the meeting .

Hillary Rodham Clinton vowed Wednesday to continue her quest for the Democratic nomination , arguing she would be the stronger nominee because she appeals to a wider coalition of voters — including whites who have not supported Barack Obama in recent contests .
“ I have a much broader base to build a winning coalition on , ” she said in an interview with USA TODAY .
As evidence , Clinton cited an Associated Press article “ that found how Sen .
Obama ’s support among working , hard - working Americans , white Americans , is weakening again , and how whites in both states who had not completed college were supporting me . ” ( Emphasis mine ) “ There ’s a pattern emerging here , ” she said .
Wow , just imagine the feeding frenzy if Barack Obama had said something like that about black people .

Design Inspiration : the Anatomy of a Great Blog Ad
I just posted at the Blog Herald about how to design a great ad .
I ’d like to follow that up here with some further comments and examples for inspiration as we consider how to maximize the relatively small number of pixels and small share of a reader ’s attention many blog ads receive .
I ’d like to focus on the 125 px ad , since I find that size the most difficult to design given the shape and size , and the fact that these ads are very popular with bloggers right now .
Make them want to click
When designing any advertisement , one should remember standard advertising principles .
One of the main things is to give your readers a reason to click or a “ call to action ” .
For most sites just the name of the site with a picture will not be compelling enough .
Neat illustration , but no compelling reason for me to click .
If was into drums … maybe , but I ’d be disappointed , because the site is actually about blogging :
This one gives me a reason to click .
I ’m curious , I want to find out how I can save that kind of money on hosting :
Stand out from the crowd
So many of these ads look so similar .
Same colors , same look , same shape …. boring .
If you ’re considering buying ad space on a site , check out the competition .
Choose some unusual color or shape .
This ad looks just like every other ad you always see .
It ’s blue and black and boring :
Here are some ads that play with shape to stand out .
The Cold Fusion ad uses color nicely as well - really pops out at you :
Be judicious with the use of animation
Some animation can be effective , but too much or too long is bad news .
You ’ll either annoy the reader or they ’ll miss half your message .
You only get like a nanosecond of a blog reader ’s attention .
Building in too many steps to your ad is a waste , and an ad that is too blinky is just annoying .
This ad uses one too many frames and the timing is off .
I was curious until I had to wait 5 seconds to see what the next frame was .
( The use of a sketched look is great though ! ) :
Amazon does it right .
Just enough animation to draw the eye , along with a simple message and a call to action :
Do n’t get too wordy
I ’ll never read more than a couple of lines on an ad , and especially if it ’s a 125 px ad , there ’s just not room for that much text before it gets too small to be quickly legible .
Do n’t forget about using whitespace - even in a small ad .
Just terrible .
Too much text and impossible to read in a glance :
The ad for PMetrics is just right : easy to read in one short glance :
If you want to see lots of ugly , blinky ads , you can check out the Banner Report site .
There are some gems among all the bad ones though .
What do you think ?
Do you even see ads on blogs anymore ?
What causes you to click on an ad ?
We often see a women complaining about a men , to that man or to other women .
We less often see the gender - reversed scenario .
At least that is what I see , in friends , family , movies , and music .
Yes , men roll their eyes , and perhaps in general women talk more about people .
But women complain more , even taking these into account .
Why ?
The politically correct theory is that women ’s lives are worse , so they have more to complain about .
After all , men often ignore , disrespect , and abandon , even beat and rape , women .
But slaves were n’t know for being complainers , and they had the most to complain about .
Women also ignore , disrespect , abandon , and beat men .
Women rarely rape men , but they do cuckold them .
Men suffer more health and violence problems , and the standard evolutionary story is that men suffer a higher outcome variance , and so have more disappointments .
The opposite theory is that women complain because their lives are better ; complaints could be weak version of tantrums , which can be seen as status symbols .
But even relatively low status women seem to complain a lot .
Clearly part of the story is that when women complain , others tend to sympathize and take their side , but when men complain , others tend to snicker and think less of them .
But why are their complaints treated so differently ?
One factor is that we value toughness more in men than women .
Another factor is that men seem to signal their devotion to women more than vice versa .
But I ’m not sure why these happen , or if they are sufficient explanations .
Whatever the true story , the politically correct theory , that women complain more due to worse lives , seems both wrong and biased .
Surely most people know enough men and women to see that their quality of life is not that different , at least compared to their complaint rates .

HBO 's Retelling of the 2000 Florida Election Debacle on Sunday Raises Interesting Questions about 2008 Certain to be Ignored as Quickly as Possible by the American Corporate Mainstream Media ...
Brad Friedman Byon 5/23/2008 , 6:35 am PT
" The recount never really happened , " notes Kevin Spacey , correctly , about the 2000 Florida election debacle in his interview Wednesday night on Countdown , in advance of Recount , HBO 's theatrical retelling of the nightmare .
The film premieres this Sunday .
Some weeks ago , we ran an item which included the theatrical trailer for the film and noted that we 've neither seen it , nor been contacted by anybody from the production ( they did n't purchase an ad here either , boo hoo ) but that they did manage to use our " Stuck in the Middle With You " theme song for the film , curiously enough , as you 'll see in the trailer .
We 'll take it as a compliment , as if we have a choice .
We also noted , with evidence , that Al Gore received more votes than George W. Bush in the state of Florida in 2000 , and that seven whistleblowers from the company , Sequoia Voting Systems , who produced the paper ballots for Florida , have come forward to reveal that they were forced by someone to use bad paper on those ballots ( only in Florida ) against their objections , and to misalign the chads on them ( only in Palm Beach County ) .
To this day , other than Dan Rather at HDNet , who originally ran the report , nobody in the corporate media has found that story worthy of following up , or even merely reporting .
But for the third in our countdown of productions with the word " count " in its title , we turn to our friend Mary Mancini , who smartly blogs at the website of the documentary film Uncounted ( We 're in it , so see FULL DISCLOSURE at end of this article ) .
Mancini notes that Olbermann , during his interview with Spacey ( at left , including clip from film ) , joined so many other journalists who have taken the opportunity of the premiere of HBO 's film to miss more than a few good journalistic opportunities ...
With all the publicity surrounding this movie , now would be the perfect time for journalists to take the national conversation to the next level and ask the most logical follow up questions :
1 ) Why was n’t our electoral process equipped , as Kevin Spacey says in the interview , “ to handle margins of victory so small and margins of error so big ” in 2000 ?
2 ) Are we equipped to do so now ?
...
Another great opportunity was lost last night when during the interview Spacey explains the punch - card recount process :
That when you have a margin of victory so small , you have to go to what is called an automatic machine recount and yet , 18 counties , over 1,500,00 votes , did n’t bother to put their ballots back through the machine .
They just re-tabulated the memory card , and you always get a different count when you do a machine recount .
So , when you kind of realize that , well , that ’s ’ cause people just could n’t bother to do it , um , it ’s pretty stunning that …that …so .. when Baker and Bush kept coming out and saying , “ The votes have been counted , and they ’ve been counted again , and Gore wants to count them a third time , ” they were actually never counted .
No , they were n't .
And the Supreme Court demanded that they remain uncounted , so Bush could be named " President . "
Only the media and academic consortium who actually did bother to count all of those ballots [ PDF ] afterwards in Florida would know that Gore received more votes than Bush .
Period .
Even if they 've done a superb job of keeping that little fact to themselves ever since .
Whether HBO 's Recount tells that truth , we 'll have to wait until Sunday to find out .
Following below , for your convenience , are both the HBO trailer for Recount and , once again , the breathtaking Dan Rather report on the gaming of the paper ballots in Florida 's 2000 election ...

A former soldier who shot dead four members of his family before walking into a police station with a bag of weapons and a homemade bomb was detained on Wednesday for a minimum of 15 years , police said .
David Bradley , 41 , will serve his sentence in a secure hospital after admitting manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility at Newcastle Crown Court .
He shot his uncle , aunt and two cousins through the head at their three - bed semi- detached home in Newcastle , England , in July 2006 .
Other bloggers complain of weight loss or gain , sleep disorders , exhaustion and other maladies born of the nonstop strain of producing for a news and information cycle that is as always - on as the Internet .
To be sure , there is no official diagnosis of death by blogging , and the premature demise of two people obviously does not qualify as an epidemic .
There is also no certainty that the stress of the work contributed to their deaths .
But friends and family of the deceased , and fellow information workers , say those deaths have them thinking about the dangers of their work style .
The pressure even gets to those who work for themselves  and are being well - compensated for it .
“ I have n’t died yet , ” said Michael Arrington , the founder and co-editor of TechCrunch , a popular technology blog .
The site has brought in millions in advertising revenue , but there has been a hefty cost .
Mr. Arrington says he has gained 30 pounds in the last three years , developed a severe sleeping disorder and turned his home into an office for him and four employees .
“ At some point , I ’ll have a nervous breakdown and be admitted to the hospital , or something else will happen . ”
“ This is not sustainable , ” he said .
It is unclear how many people blog for pay , but there are surely several thousand and maybe even tens of thousands .
The emergence of this class of information worker has paralleled the development of the online economy .
Publishing has expanded to the Internet , and advertising has followed .
Lilly Ledbetter , pictured here with Hillary Clinton yesterday , got totally screwed by the Supreme Court .
And now she 's being screwed by the Senate .
You see , Lilly was a supervisor for an Alabama Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company .
She was being paid less than every single one of the male supervisors : 15 % less than the lowest paid male supervisors and 40 % less than the highest paid .
Lilly had no idea that she was being stiffed by her bosses , because in her contract she had agreed not to discuss her salary with anyone outside of her family .
An anonymous coworker slipped her a note , telling her she was being cheated , and so Lilly decided to sue Goodyear for the discrimination .
A lower court awarded Ledbetter $ 3.8 million , but the Supreme Court overturned the decision — because she did n't file the claim within 180 days of her first unfair paycheck ( though there was absolutely no way she could have known she was making less at that point ) .

As a result of that patent unfairness , the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was put before the Senate yesterday .
And it was voted down , 56 - 42 .
By a Republican filibuster .
And John McCain did n't even bother to show up to vote .
The Ledbetter Act would have allowed people more than 180 days to file claims against their employers , and , according to U.S. News and World Report , " It would have each discriminatory paycheck trigger a new claim - filing period , that is , another 180 - day window in which to file a case with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission . "
McCain , however , is against it because , according to the Daily Kos , McCain is " all in favor of pay equity for women , but this kind of legislation , as is typical of what 's being proposed by my friends on the other side of the aisle , opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems ... This is government playing a much , much greater role in the business of a private enterprise system . "

As Kos points out , " Pay discrimination is already illegal .
This legislation would have fixed a bad [ Supreme Court ] decision that severely limited the ability of workers to hold their employers accountable for breaking the law . "
Both Obama and Clinton voted in favor of the Ledbetter Act .
The fact that this Act was voted down in the first place makes me want to vomit , but it 's especially depressing if you read Ruth Bader Ginsberg 's dissenting opinion in the Supreme Court case .
Ginsberg , of course , was one of four judges who voted in favor of Ledbetter , and she wrote , " The jury also heard testimony that another supervisor — who evaluated Ledbetter in 1997 and whose evaluation led to her most recent raise denial — was openly biased against women ...
And two women who had previously worked as managers at the plant told the jury they had been subject to pervasive discrimination and were paid less than their male counterparts .
One was paid less than the men she supervised ... Ledbetter herself testified about the discriminatory animus conveyed to her by plant officials .
Toward the end of her career , for instance , the plant manager told Ledbetter that the ' plant did not need women , that [ women ] did n't help it , [ and ] caused problems . ' "

What the fuck .
On a micro level , Lilly Ledbetter got completely fucked over .
On a macro one , Republicans do n't give a shit about anyone but CEOs .
I 'm just as baffled about this as Nevada Senator Harry Reid , who said , " I do n't know how anyone would oppose something like this .
It just makes sense that people should be treated fairly . "

Equal Pay Is n't A Partisan Issue .
Is it ? [ Time ]
The government 's own scientific advisers last night warned the home secretary , Jacqui Smith , that her decision to upgrade the legal status of cannabis would not work in curbing its widespread abuse .
Professor Sir Michael Rawlins , chairman of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs ( ACMD ) , said moving cannabis from class C to class B " is neither warranted , nor will it achieve its desired effect " .
Smith told the House of Commons yesterday that she had to take into consideration public perceptions and the pressures on policing as well as the advice of the advisory council .
" There is a compelling case to act now rather than risk the future health of young people , " she said .
" Where there is a clear and serious problem , but doubt about the harm that will be caused , we must err on the side of caution and protect the public .
I make no apology for that I am not prepared to ' wait and see ' . "
The ACMD , the government 's own expert body on drugs , decided by 20 votes to three to recommend that cannabis remain a class C drug .
Its nine - month review concluded that while more potent , homegrown strains of herbal cannabis , such as skunk , now dominate the British market , the evidence of a substantial link with mental illness remains weak .
Rawlins said that the government had the right to consider other factors but warned that reclassification would make little difference to the levels of consumption : " We know that for people who smoke cannabis , it makes no difference to them whether it is class A , B or C .
What is important is a really vigorous public health response . "
The home secretary told MPs she had accepted the 20 other recommendations made by the ACMD , including a tougher enforcement campaign against cannabis farms , a crackdown on " head shops " which sell cannabis paraphernalia , including seeds , and a renewed public health campaign .
Smith confirmed that the police approach to those under 18 found in possession of small amounts would remain unchanged .
The police will continue to have the discretion to issue warnings to most adults found with small amounts of dope .
But the home secretary made it clear that she has asked the police to propose a tougher enforcement policy with escalating penalties for repeat offenders including fixed penalty fines and in cases involving aggravating factors , such as those which happen in a psychiatric hospital , a prison or a school .
Supplying the drug to children , students , psychiatric patients or prisoners will also attract harsher sentences .
DrugScope , the leading drugs information charity , said in a statement that it was disappointed the government had ignored the ACMD 's advice : " Unfortunately , the message given by this decision is that drugs policy can be driven as much by political considerations , media headlines and scare stories as by the evidence . "
Professor Colin Blakemore , the former head of the Medical Research Council , said that cannabis use had fallen since 2004 and restoring the drug to class B status would be unlikely to protect those people who were most vulnerable , but would increase their chance of getting a criminal record .
" The confusion over cannabis highlights the need for a proper overhaul of the present classification system , which the public neither understands or respects , " Blakemore said .
The shadow home secretary , David Davis , welcomed the reclassification decision , but asked why it had taken so long .
" The government 's lax approach to drugs is the hallmark of our broken society under Labour , " he told MPs .
" The UK has the worst level of overall drug abuse in Europe .
Drug crimes have increased by almost a half under this government . "
Cannabis was downgraded from class B under Tony Blair , but Gordon Brown announced a review of its status soon after becoming prime minister .
The Liberal Democrats ' home affairs spokesman , Chris Huhne , said it was " crazy " to ignore the government 's scientific advisers by raising the maximum prison sentence for cannabis possession to five years .
" Cannabis use is falling , as is the incidence of psychosis , " he said .
" We need public education , not public flagellation . "
how exactly does one signal “ I ’m being held at gunpoint ” ?

I ’m reading about the latest contender for “ Child Left Behind of the Year ”
From the Associated Press : CLEVELAND —
A carjacking suspect stopped during the crime to ask a television news crew for directions , police said .
… WOIO - TV newswoman Shannon O’Brien and photographer Eric Walls were doing a sidewalk report Monday on bank problems when the passenger in a car asked for directions to a bank .
The driver signaled that he was being held at gunpoint , O’Brien told police .
The news crew called police and followed the car until officers caught up .
Police Lt. Thomas Stacho said the suspect was carrying a loaded handgun .
and I ’m curious about how someone silently signals that they are being held at gunpoint , because it seems like a useful thing to know …

I can think of a few ways …
“ Raise your hand if you ’re being held a gunpoint ”
or you can try passing a note …

Quotabull is a weekly feature of Scholars & Rogues .
During this week 's Google I/O conference of developers , AOL publicly declared their love of OpenSocial as they announced their future support of OpenSocial with AOL services .
The first integration point will be seen during the next " few months " at myAOL.com , where Google 's Gadgets will soon be available .
That is only the beginning , though , as OpenSocial support is planned for " all AOL products and platforms . "
Eric Staats , Principal Software Engineer at AOL , made a post summarizing the move at the Google OpenSocial blog today :
As I discussed in my presentation , adopting Gadgets as our widget format within myAOL is the first step in adopting OpenSocial across AOL products and services .
Gadgets will allow us to offer developers more opportunities to bring their ideas to myAOL , while keeping our users safer .
Additionally , Gadgets will make it easier for application developers to create new tools and widgets for myAOL that will also be available to AOL users across the web at large on any OpenSocial enabled container .
On a topic only tangentially related to this , Jerry Yang and Sue Decker were interviewed by Walt Mossberg today .
The general concensus from the analysts on Yahoo , particularly recently , is that they 're a shiftless company with no clear focus , something that was made quite clear in the interview today when Yang made it quite clear that he knew that Yahoo had a desparate need to focus on something , but could n't quite pin down for Walt what it was they were going to be focusing on .
AOL has suffered similarly , acquiring and developing all sorts of neat utilities over the years , but never bringing much of that technology together in any sort of cohesive strategy .
Certainly they 're starting to do something with their advertising properties , but in the world of video and other forms of multimedia , they 're quite often competing with themselves , instead of trying to bring their properties into some sort of harmony with one another .
That 's why it 's encouraging to hear that some sort of unifying development environment is going to be implemented .
There are a lot of cool things under the umbrella over at AOL , and seeing how they 're going to make them social and mashable is definitely going to be interesting , and ultimately positive for the company .

Could Wind help Save Water ?
May 18th , 2008 by Michelle Bennett
Big news for the wind industry , big implications for water .
First , the Department of Energy released a report that confirmed what the wind industry has already claimed : wind could power 20 % of the United State ’s energy needs by 2030 .
Even with growing energy demands , our ample wind resources could meet one - fifth of our needs with continued growth and innovation .
Other nations , especially Denmark , are already deriving significant fractions of their energy from wind , sometimes with impressive results .
The truth is , wind energy is booming even as the specter of the expiring Production Tax Credit moves to the House of Representatives for a vote .
Another large announcement this week came from ex-oilman T. Boone Pickens , who proved ( once again ) that every thing ’s bigger in Texas .
He just ordered $ 2 billion worth of wind turbines from GE to build the world ’s largest wind farm .
Texas has already shown that wind is n’t just good for the environment , it ’s also good for rural jobs .
There ’s even a town in Missouri that derives almost all of its energy from wind power , and sells excess energy to other towns .
These examples and more disprove many of the wind myths that are still floating around .
Wind energy is not a perfect technology , but it holds powerful potential to diversify power generation around the world .
One of the statistics that struck me is that wind power could :
“ reduce water consumption associated with electricity generation by 4 trillion gallons by 2030 . ”
( Source )
With drought affecting many places around the world , including Australia and several American regions , any technology that conserves water carries important implications .
Even areas with abundant water resources ( and recent flooding ) are concerned about over - exploitation of their water .
One part of the water issue is that nuclear and coal - fired power plants require a lot of water , billions of gallons per day across the nation .
Some of that water is ultimately returned to its source , but some is also lost or polluted .
In areas with scarce or dwindling water resources , a host of hydra - headed problems appear simultaneously : agriculture and food , energy , population , health and sanitation , development , industry , environment .
Our lives , economy , and society are intimately linked to water , and scarcity is often a source of instability .
Judging from various efforts around the globe , it ’s safe to say that conserving water is cheaper than alternatives .
Australia and Barcelona are potent examples of the cost of water shortages ; both are spending a lot of money to secure their water supplies .
In Los Angeles , recycling sewage is cheaper than piping it in .
If things get worse , Boone Pickens ’ investment will look like a steal .
By investing in water - friendly energy production , you strike two birds with one stone .
You add a buffer for communities in case of future water shortages by removing resource conflicts before they occur .
Wind power could also help us prepare for the effects of climate change and shifting weather patterns , which are already evident around the globe .
There is also the possibility of harvesting potable water from the ocean , but desalination plants are expensive and use large amounts of energy .
Another proven method may be to encourage natural water storage via wetlands .
A town in the state of Georgia , outside of drought - stricken Atlanta , has not felt the effects of the southeast ’s severe drought due to smart water planning .
But even these methods fundamentally react to a water shortage instead of preventing it .
Wind is certainly no placebo for water supply problems , but it could be part of the solution .
For me , this is another example of how renewable energy is a sound investment in the long - term , and how we can reap unexpected benefits from clean technology .

At its best , America 's infrastructure has powered our economic prosperity , created well - paying jobs , and served the public interest .
Today , however , it has fallen into a dangerous state of disrepair .
The Minnesota bridge collapse last summer brought home the urgency of repairing and modernizing our nation 's system of highways , bridges , tunnels , power plants , transmission lines , and airports .
But doing so will be prohibitively expensive .
Current plans seek to exploit the nation 's need for private profit .
But there 's a better source of capital at hand : public pension funds .
The American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that $ 1.6 trillion is needed in the next five years alone just to maintain the adequacy of existing infrastructure .
But even if every bridge was repaired , it still would not be enough – trillions more will be required to build the new systems necessary to keep our economy competitive .
As anyone who commutes every day knows , we need to reduce congestion on our roads and in the air , speed the transportation of people and goods , increase energy efficiency , and do so in ways that are environmentally sustainable .
The thought of coming up with the money necessary for all this , makes people wince – understandably .
This is a time when many states face budget shortfalls and our federal deficit is at an all - time high .
Leaders of both the Republican and Democratic parties know the US cannot raise money from traditional public sources of financing , including municipal bonds , user fees , and taxes .
The financiers on Wall Street already have positioned themselves to take advantage of this national crisis for their own gain .
Where most Americans see crumbling bridges and traffic congestion , the money managers see a treasure trove of fees , profits , and more record bonuses for CEOs .
It 's why some private equity firms and banks on Wall Street are raising massive funds to buy these assets that have typically been owned and managed by the government .
In recent years , new infrastructure funds have been established in North America with capital commitments of $ 40 to $ 45 billion .
These private funds have sprouted up like weeds , structured for short - term profits and sky - high fees – usually up to a 2 percent management fee plus up to 20 percent of the profits .
It would be a monumental mistake to turn the future of America 's infrastructure over to the same crowd that brought us the subprime crisis , an economy loaded down with debt , and recession .
We should know better by now than to create a scenario where bridges and highways are sliced and diced like subprime loans into financially engineered " collateralized infrastructure obligations . "
America needs a large source of stable , long - term capital to build the system of buildings , roads , and power supplies needed to sustain the country .
We need a source of capital that values infrastructure because it provides a reasonable rate of return , strengthens the overall economy , and does n't burden users with excessive fees .
Enter that source of capital :
Public pension funds , which are responsible for the retirement benefits of more than 18 million Americans , have more than $ 3 trillion in assets , and a long - term investment approach consistent with the stable returns that infrastructure assets generate .
Pension funds could buy and build infrastructure , putting the profits to work for the retirement of workers , not for the benefit of Wall Street CEOs .
This is how it works : Pension funds pool their assets and invest directly in projects to build new roads and bridges in multiple states , bypassing the Wall Street firms that want to siphon off profits .
The steadyily increasing streams of revenue that come from tolls and other sources would deliver stable , long - term returns to working Americans , while creating well - paying construction and service jobs connected to each project .
These pooled pension direct investment vehicles would :
• Provide the much needed capital infusion sought by governors and state legislatures to improve their states ' infrastructure ;
• Ensure that billions of dollars stay in our communities instead of going to big financial firms ;
• Create a multiplier effect , generating jobs , economic activity , and new tax revenue for states ;
• Achieve strong investment returns and stable long - term cash flows that meet or exceed actuarially required levels ; and
• Support " green " infrastructure projects that are environmentally sustainable .
Hurdles remain to pension funds ' direct investment in infrastructure .
Pension funds with little history of collaboration will have to work together .
But one important barrier could be lifted by passing federal legislation that would allow pension funds to access tax - exempt debt to finance infrastructure investments .
This is a solution worth supporting .
Public pension funds , governors , state treasurers , comptrollers , and the Service Employees International Union ( SEIU ) , whose members participate in pension funds with more than $ 1 trillion in assets , have begun preliminary discussions about how to create this type of investment vehicle .
This collaboration offers a promising model for a win-win solution to help address the growing infrastructure problem we face across America .
• Kathleen Sebelius is the Democratic governor of Kansas .
Andy Stern is the president of the SEIU and author of " A country that works . "
It had been a rough day , but when Alan Schwartz headed for home on Friday , March 14 , the Bear Stearns Cos. chief executive thought he'd have a month to find a buyer for his teetering firm .
A quickly concocted loan , guaranteed by the government for up to 28 days , allowed the brokerage to open its doors that morning .

The NonGuidebook Version of What to Do ( and Not Do ) in NYC
Its that time of year : New York City is flooded with tourists .
Thanks to the weak American Peso , the place is just thick with 'em .
There are lots of standard guides you might find helpful to use ( i.e. , NYC Guide for Tourists ) , but they are primarily designed for that gullible visitor , the double decker riding , Hawaiian shirt wearing , one born every minute visitor -- the Rube .
That 's not you .
You are much hipper than that .
You want to be in the know , plugged in , well connected .
Well , ya came to the right place .
I 'm going to give you the straight dope , the inside info that the guidebooks do n't tell you about .
This is real insider trading , " Blue Horse Shoe Loves Anacot Steel " type stuff that people go to jail for .
Not you or me , but people .
Some people .
Mostly tourists .
Anyway , instead of relying on a Fodors or Let 's Go NYC , consider these suggestions from a born and bred Nu Yawkah ( I even got dah aksent dat gos wit da place ) .
A Brooklyn born guy who works in finance and has worked in NYC most of his Adult life , this guy knows a thing or two about Gotham .
These suggestions will help make your stay in the city enjoyable and safe .
It well help you get the most out of your visit here .
As an added bonus , I get to keep all of you birkenstocked , rucksack wearing , slow walking , camera snapping touristas out from underfoot of us locals .
Enjoy .

A New Yorker 's Guide for Tourists : 20 Ways to Make Your Stay in New York City More Enjoyable
>
1. DO NOT DRESS ALIKE .
This is for your safety , as well as for the benefit of the typical New Yorker 's highly refined aesthetic sense .
At all costs , avoid wearing identical matching outfits .
Worse than looking like hicks from the sticks , you will look like a group of out - of - towners begging to be mugged .
I do n't mean literally mugged by a criminal element , but rather , robbed by unscrupulous taxi drivers and retail merchants alike .
They will spot you as a rube , and be all too happy take advantage of your apparent naivete to lighten your wallets .
You might as well carry a sign that says " Rob Me ! " -- and they will .
The corollary to this is to avoid festooning every item of clothing you have on with " New York , NYC , or Yankees " logos --
No one is THAT big of a fan -- for the same reason as above .
~~~
2. BATHROOMS : Here 's the thing :
There just are n't many public bathrooms in NYC .
Why ?
Its a long story , which I do n't have time to go into , but there just are n't that many .
Plan accordingly .
Your best bets are as follows :
Department stores
Starbucks
Barnes & Noble / Borders Bookstores
Restaurants
Hotels
The nicest public toilet in the city is Bryant Park at 42nd Street between 5 / 6 .
Sometimes there is a wait .
For those of you who have real , um , reallygottagonow issues , its best that you plan ahead .
Get a copy of Where to Go : A Guide to Manhattan 's Toilets .
Thats right , the NYC toilet situation is so absurd that someone wrote a book about it .
On the plus side , the Rainbow Room and the Grand Havana Club have some of the nicest bathrooms I 've ever been in -- floor to ceiling windows , right next to the urinals !
~~~
3. Tipping :
The city has a service - based economy , and tipping is encouraged / demanded / insisted upon .
Some basic suggestions : 15 % of the bill for " Fair " service , 20 % for " Good " service .
This applies to waiters , waiteresses , bartenders , cab drivers , call girls , etc .
Note that you can easily ballpark 15 % by doubling the tax ( ~16 % ) .
Chamber maids should get $ 5 per day .
Leaving a 5 - 10 % tip is considered a complaint -- but stiffing ( leaving nothing ) is not perceived as a complaint , but as a sign of cheapness / cluelessness .
Note that for large parties ( 6 or more ) some restaurants automatically add the tip to the bill , so double check that bill ( do n't double tip ) .
~~~
4. See a LIVE TV Show :
This requires some advanced planning , usually 6 months to a year ahead of time .
I suggest Late Show with David Letterman , The Daily Show , The Colbert Report , Late Night with Conan O'Brien , and Saturday Night Live ( email SNL TIckets ) .
If you did not plan in advance for this year , no worries : Just diary this for next December or January to order tickets for Summer 2009 .
Imagine where the US Dollar will be then -- we 'll practically be paying you to come here !
~~~
5 . Do a bunch of local New York things :
Hang out in Central Park , Explore Brooklyn , wear black , enjoy the free WiFi in Bryant Park ( use the bathroom there -- nice ) .
Attend a lecture at the 92nd ST Y , go to Chinatown in Queens .
Buy junk at a street fair , and eat street meat ( do n't ask ) .
Have a cigar at the Grand Havana Room ( members only ) .
Catch an author speak at a Barnes & Noble ( use the bathroom while you are there ) .
Spend a weekend at Fire Island or the Hamptons ( make arrangements first ) .
Go to a designer sample sale .
Do the NYT crossword puzzle on mass transit .
Jog around the reservoir in Central Park .
Go to a Woody Allen retrospective .
See the Mets at Shea .
The ultimate New Yorker activity ?
Buy the Sunday NY Times late Saturday night ; skim it , then lounge around early Sunday morning , with the paper -- and a pot of strong coffee -- in bed Sunday morning .
Heavenly !

6. iPod walking guides
Continued -- A New Yorker 's Guide for Tourists : 20 Ways to Make Your Stay in New York City More Enjoyable
>
6. iPod walking guides
There are lots of really cool guides to various Manhattan neighborhoods .
I have n't done all of these , but I 've done a few -- most of these come highly recommended .
Lastly , note that Apple 's iTunes Music Store and Audible.com also offer a wide catalog of audio tours for purchase and many are for no charge .
~~~~
7 . Watch out for DELIVERY and MESSENGER BIKES !
Most people can easily avoid getting run over by buses , trucks , and cabs -- they are large and visible , and frequently go the right way on one way streets .
None of the above applies to bicyclists .
Many are suicidal maniacs seeking to save money on the cost of cyanide , and by ignoring all road rules , they hope to meet their makers that much sooner .
You do n't want to join them .
Be aware :
They run lights , jump up on sidewalks , go the wrong way down one way streets .
Look for them when getting in and out of cabs , or crossing midtown streets , or popping out between parked cars .
They can be bone crushers -- be careful .
~~~
8. DO NOT DO THE FOLLOWING : Walk four abreast holding hands ; Congregate around busy street corners , hang around stairways or active doorways ;
Do not clutter up Grand Central Station during rush - hour ( 8 - 9 and 5 - 6 ) -- its much nicer around 11 am ;
These are just a start -- there are many other DO NOTs I can think of , but rather than list them , let me impress upon you the importance of Situational Awareness .
This is a military and aviation term , but it also refers to any complex environment where errors in the decision making process has significant repercussions .
" Situation awareness has been formally defined as " the perception of elements in the environment within a volume of time and space , the comprehension of their meaning , and the projection of their status in the near future . "
Just please try to stand a little bit out of the way while making such future status projections .
~~~
9. Taxis :
Two things you should remember about cabs :
They work 12 hour shifts that end around 6:00 , so getting a cab between 5 and 6 pm is always a challenge .
Also , as soon as it starts to rain , the available cabs become invisible .
( No one knows why ) .
On Duty : Look at the light on top of the car -- 4 or 5 random letters and numbers , like GR45 .
When it 's lit , the cab is available ;
See the off - duty sign on either side ?
When they are lit , the cab is unavailable .
Easy !
~~~
10 .
Buy the following books :
Also , bookmark the following NY Magazine webpages :
~~~
11 . Go on , ask us something , ANYTHING .
Surprise !
New Yorkers are much nicer people than you have heard .

Get outta the way !
Despite the above , let me remind you that this is a working city .
This is not like Washington , DC , or Las Vegas -- places that are artificially supported by the hard work of fools from other cities .
No , this is an actual working city with real industries : Wall Street and finance , advertising , publishing , film & broadcast television , fashion , theater , media , real estate , dining , and tourism .
Also on the list : bioscience , web design , software development , game design , sex , food - processing and internet services .

Since so many of you have asked :
This started with friends from California who were coming to visit NYC -- they had never been before -- and wanted what they described as the nonGuidebook version of what to do in NYC .
So what began as an email exchange turned into a list of 20 Ways to Make Your Stay in NYC More Enjoyable .
I polished it up , thinking readers from out of town might appreciate this -- it is definitely NOT Fodors material ...

HAVANA ( Reuters ) - New Cuban President Raul Castro announced on Monday that all death sentences had been commuted to prison terms of 30 years to life , with the exception of three people charged with terrorism .

“ The Council of State decided to commute the death penalty imposed on a group of prisoners , ” Raul Castro announced at a Communist party Central Committee meeting , in a speech broadcast by state - run television .
Castro said two Central Americans charged with hotel bombings in the 1990s that took the life of an Italian tourist , and a Cuban American charged with murder during an attempt at armed infiltration of the island , were not included and their cases were still on appeal .
“ This does not mean we have eliminated the death penalty from the penal code , ” Raul Castro said .
He blasted the United States for allowing Cuban Americans to use its soil to launch violent attacks on the country .
“ It would be irresponsible and ingenuous to renounce the dissuasive power that capital punishment has on the real terrorists , the Imperialist mercenaries , ” he said .
Cuba has been under pressure from human rights organizations to eliminate the death penalty , which is carried out by firing squad .
Just three people have been executed since 2000 , all of them involved in a failed 2003 boat hijacking .
“ This decision was not undertaken because of pressure , but as a sovereign act in line with the humanitarian and ethical conduct that has characterized the Cuban revolution from the start , ” he said .
Since taking over from his ailing brother Fidel Castro in February , Raul Castro has lifted a number of restrictions on daily life , from owning cell phones to entering tourist hotels .
Cuba in early March signed two important United Nations human rights agreements long opposed by Fidel Castro .
The elder Castro , 81 , underwent intestinal surgery in July 2006 from which he has never fully recovered , leading him to resign as president this year after almost half a century in power .
Consider , for example , two separate eras in the lifetime of the baby - boom generation .
For every additional dollar earned by the bottom 90 percent of the population between 1950 and 1970 , those in the top 0.01 percent earned an additional $ 162 .
That gap has since skyrocketed .
For every additional dollar earned by the bottom 90 percent between 1990 and 2002 , Mr. Johnston wrote , each taxpayer in that top bracket brought in an extra $ 18,000 .
It 's like chasing a speedboat with a rowboat .
Put the myth of the American Dream aside .
The bottom line is that it 's becoming increasingly difficult for working Americans to move up in class .
The rich are freezing nearly everybody else in place , and sprinting off with the nation 's bounty .
Economic mobility in the United States -- the extent to which individuals and families move from one social class to another -- is no higher than in Britain or France , and lower than in some Scandinavian countries .
Maybe we should be studying the Scandinavian dream .
As far as the Bush administration is concerned , the gap between the rich and the rest of us is not growing fast enough .
An analysis by The Times showed the following :
" Under the Bush tax cuts , the 400 taxpayers with the highest incomes -- a minimum of $ 87 million in 2000 , the last year for which the government will release such data -- now pay income , Medicare and Social Security taxes amounting to virtually the same percentage of their incomes as people making $ 50,000 to $ 75,000 .
Those earning more than $ 10 million a year now pay a lesser share of their income in these taxes than those making $ 100,000 to $ 200,000 . "
The social dislocations resulting from this war that nobody mentions have been under way for some time .
But the Bush economic policies have accelerated the consequences and intensified the pain .
We humbly suggest this When In Doubt , Try Another Hole shirt for your annual " please let me keep my Gizmodo " plea to your IT guy .
But note that while we condone the apparel , we can't necessarily support the advice .
Lest it lead to an awkward night with your spouse , or worse still , their printer / fax .

Abbywinters.com is an example of how sex sites are going the more realistic route .
( Editor 's note : Links in this story that are not safe for work are marked NSFW . )
Fakery – fake scenarios , fake chemistry , fake body parts and fake orgasms – is an integral part of the porn monolith .
But a pair of porn sites that take a decidedly realistic approach to the subject of sex are paving a path to the industry 's future .
At first glance , abbywinters.com ( NSFW ) might look like just another " barely legal " porn site , and Kink.com ( NSFW ) like yet another fetish studio .
Websites in Kink 's network explore themes ranging from dominance and submission ( NSFW ) to sex machines ( NSFW ) , while Australian " amateurs " site abbywinters showcases the first blush of young womanhood in all its natural beauty – no makeup , no boob jobs and no men .
It 's no fluke .
Kink launched in 1997 , abbywinters in 2000 , and both have managed to stay in step with changing consumer desires .
The secret to the sites ' longevity in an industry known for its churn lies in their emphasis on a genuine sexual experience .
These sites wisely avoid the temptation to jump on the porn theme du jour , to cycle quickly through female performers and to use shock as a marketing strategy .
In the early days of the internet , anal sex was risqué , and straight people pretended they 'd never looked at gay porn .
By now , we 've all seen the wall - to - wall , triple - penetration , all - natural , ass - to - mouth MILF scenes .
Hell , by now , we all know what two girls can do with one cup .
Call me radical , call me a prude , but I am certain that the future of commercial pornography lies not in slick studio shoots or dare - you - to - look sexual freak shows but in realistic portrayals of sexual experiences … in partners with real chemistry , in capturing the frisson of a usually dominant person submitting to a top for the first time ( on camera ) , in the nervous energy of a 19 - year - old making her debut by masturbating in front of a model - turned - videographer .
Newfangled producers like Kink and abbywinters are building successful businesses by creating content in which sex unfolds naturally , at its own pace .
They still offer the content in every way possible , from short clips to features to making - of documentaries to live on - set streaming , but at the root of it all is pure , authentic sex .
After all , when everyone 's doing it , just being willing to get naked and get pounded is not enough to make porn hot .
Abbywinters offers the one - on - one feel of a cam site , the production values of a high - definition digital studio and the genuine sexual energy of good amateur video .
While not accepting user - generated content , the team encourages input from site visitors .
Fans can post a suggestion in the forums and find themselves discussing it with a director within hours .
The shoot might even begin the next day .
Staffers develop a scenario for each shoot , but let the sexual energy build organically .
The performers decide what to do and when to do it .
It 's not uncommon for abbywinters girls to go for an hour or two , and for the entire thing – bonked heads , arousal ebbs and flows , hiccups and all – to end up on a DVD .
Similarly , Kink emphasizes transparency , publishing its pay scale and model rights policy , and delivering news and free content at Behind Kink ( NSFW ) .
Just like in real kink sex – because this is real kink sex , captured on camera – Kink 's models can stop a scene at any time by uttering a safe word .
Stopped scenes still appear on the site ; the truncated sessions are just as real as those that followed the initial plan , and knowing that some models end things early just adds to the suspense for the subscriber .
I 've described the modern porn consumer as " savvy " and " sophisticated , " but I could just as accurately have said " jaded " and " unimpressed . "
Kink and abbywinters succeed in this environment because they recognize that they must provide more than pornographic pictures to get our interest , much less keep it .
By treating customers as collaborators , they manage to create an experience and make the fantasy real – and they do that by bringing authentic sex to the virtual realm of porn .
And it 's you , my internet sexplorers , who showed them how to do it .
See you in a fortnight ,

Web 2.0 Leaves Porn Behind
( circa 2006 Twitter maintenance cat )
Along with a whole slew of smart folks , I ’ve been playing the current think game de jour , “ How would you re-architect Twitter ? ” .
Unlike most I ’ve been having this conversation off and on for a couple of years , mostly with Blaine , in my unofficial “ Friend of Twitter ” capacity .
( the same capacity that I wrote the first Twitter bot in , and have on rare occasion logged into their boxes to play “ spot the run away performance issue . ” )
For my money Leonard ’s Brought to You By the 17th Letter of the Alphabet is probably the best proposed architecture I ’ve seen — or at least it matches my own biases when I sat down last month to sketch out how build a Twitter - like thing .
But when Leonard and I were chatting last week about this stuff , I was struck what was missing from the larger Blogosphere ’s conversation : the issues Twitter is actually facing .
Folks both within Twitter and without have framed the conversation as an architectural challenge .
Meanwhile the nattering classes have struck on the fundamental challenge of all social software ( namely the network effects ) and are reporting that they ’ve gotten confirmation from “ an individual who is familiar with the technical probelms at Twitter ” that indeed Twitter is a social software site !
Living and Dying By the Network
All social software has to deal with the network effect .
At scale it ’s hard .
And all large social software has had to solve it .
If you ’re looking for the roots of Twitter ’s special challenges , you ’re going to have to look a bit farther a field .
Though you can hedge your bets with this stuff by making less explicit promises than Twitter does ( everything from my friends in a timely fashion is pretty hard promise to keep ) .
Flickr mitigates some of this impact by making promises about recent contacts , not recent photos ( there are a fewer people than photos ) , meanwhile Facebook can hide a slew of sins behind the fact that their newsfeeds are “ editorialized ” , no claims of completeness anywhere in site .
( there is a figure floating around that at least at one point Facebook was dropping 80 % of their updates on the floor )
So while architectures that strip down Twitter to queues , and logs could be a huge win , and while thinking about new architectures is the sexy , hard problem we all want to fix , Twitter ’s problems are really of a more pedestrian hard , plumbing and ditch digging nature .
Which is less fun , but reality .
Growth
Their first problem is growth .
Honest to god hockey stick growth is so weird , and wild , and hard , thats it ’s hard to imagine and cope with if you have n’t been through it at least once .
To quote Leonard again ( this from a few weeks ago back when TC thought they ’d figured out that Twitter ’s problems were Blaine ) :
“ Even if you ’re architecturally sound , you ’re dealing with development with extremely tight timelines / pressures , so you have to make decisions to pick things that will work but will probably need to eventually be replaced ( e.g. DRb for Twitter ) — usually you wo n’t know when and what component will be the limiting factor since you do n’t know what the uses cases will be to begin with .
Development from prototype on is a series of compromises against the limited resources of man-hours and equipment .
In a perfect world , you ’d have perfect capacity planning and infinite resources , but if you ’ve ever experienced real - world hockey - stick growth on a startup shoestring , you know that ’s not the case .
If you have , you understand that scaling is the brick that hits you when you ’ve gone far beyond your capacity limits and when your machines hit double or triple digit loads .
Architecture does n’t help you one bit there . ”
Growth is hard .
Dealing with growth is rarely sexy .
When your growth goes non-linear you ’re tempted to think you ’ve stumbled into a whole class of new problems that need wild new thinking .
Resist .
New ideas should be applied judiciously .
Because mostly its plumbing .
Tuning your databases , getting your thread buffer sizes right , managing the community , and the abuse .
Intelligence and Monitoring
Growth compounds the other hard problem that Twitter ( and almost every sites I ’ve seen ) has , thery ’re running black boxes .
Social software is hard to heartbeat , socially or technically .
It ’s one of the places where our jobs are actually harder than those real time trading systems , and other five nines style hard computing systems .
And it ’s a problem Twitter is still struggling to solve .
( really you never stop solving it , your next SPOF will always come find you , and then you have something new to monitor )
Twitter came late in life to Ganglia , and have n’t had the time to really burnish it .
And Ganglia does n’t ship by default with a graph for what to do when your site needs its memcache servers hot to run .
And what do you do when Ganglia starts telling you your recent framework upgrade is causing a 10 x increase in data returned from your DBs for the same QPS .
Or that your URL shortening service is starting to slow down sporadically adding an extra 30 ms burn to message handling .
( how do you even graph that ? )
Beyond LAMP Needs Better Intelligence
Monitoring and intelligence get even harder as you start to embrace these new architectures .
Both because the systems are more complex , but largely because we do n’t know what monitoring and resourcing for Web scale queues of data , and distributed hash tables look like .
And we do n’t yet have the scars from living through the failure scenarios .
And we ’re rolling our own solutions as it is early days , without the battle hardened tweaks and flags of an Apache or MySQL .
We all know that Jabber has different performance characteristics than the Web ( that ’s rather the point ) , but we do n’t have the data to quantify what it looks like at network effect impacted scale .
( the big IM installs , particularly LJ and Google have talked a bit in public , but their usage patterns tend to be pretty different than stream style APIs .
Btw I ’ll be talking about this a bit in Portland at OSCON in a few months ! )
Recommendations
So I ’d add to Leonard ’s architecture ( and I know Leonard is thinking about this ) , and the various other cloud architectures emerging that to make it work you need build monitoring and resourcing in from the ground up , or you ’re distributed in the cloud queues are going to fail .
And solve the growth issues , with appropriate solutions for growth , which rarely involves architectural solutions .
The Transition Town initiative has been a fast - growing movement in the United Kingdom for over a year , with more than 50 towns currently signed up .
Now the United States is catching up as Boulder , CO becomes the first official transition town in the country .
The Transition Town movement started in Kinsale , Ireland when permaculture teacher Rob Hopkins started thinking about the possibilities of applying permaculture theories to entire towns , instead of just to individual plots of land .
Hopkins ’ Energy Descent Action Plan provides a blueprint for towns hoping to transition to a more sustainable way of life .
Boulder County Going Local is an ambitious effort to prepare the area for the ramifications of climate change and peak oil .
BCGL was only named an official transition initiative earlier this month , but it ’s getting started with a bang .
The organization has already launched a series of talks and workshops to teach residents how to survive with local resources entitled “ The Great Reskilling ” .
Planned events include “ High Altitude Gardening ” , “ Garden Design and Planting A La Permaculture ” , “ The Bountiful Pantry ” , and “ Solar Greenhouse Design ” .
It is sobering to think about how few survival skills most of us have .
Perhaps if more transition initiatives like Boulder ’s take off , we can relearn the skills that fossil fuel - based industrialization has rendered useless .

WASHINGTON , D.C. --
Five years ago , Congress killed an experimental Pentagon antiterrorism program meant to vacuum up electronic data about people in the U.S. to search for suspicious patterns .
Opponents called it too broad an intrusion on Americans ' privacy , even after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks .
But the data - sifting effort did n't disappear .
The National Security Agency , once confined to foreign surveillance , has been building essentially the same system .
The central role the NSA has come to occupy in domestic intelligence gathering has never been publicly disclosed .
But an inquiry reveals that its efforts have evolved to reach more broadly into data about people 's communications , travel and finances in the U.S. than the domestic surveillance programs brought to light since the 2001 terrorist attacks .
Congress now is hotly debating domestic spying powers under the main law governing U.S. surveillance aimed at foreign threats .
An expansion of those powers expired last month and awaits renewal , which could be voted on in the House of Representatives this week .
The biggest point of contention over the law , the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , is whether telecommunications and other companies should be made immune from liability for assisting government surveillance .
Largely missing from the public discussion is the role of the highly secretive NSA in analyzing that data , collected through little - known arrangements that can blur the lines between domestic and foreign intelligence gathering .
Supporters say the NSA is serving as a key bulwark against foreign terrorists and that it would be reckless to constrain the agency 's mission .
The NSA says it is scrupulously following all applicable laws and that it keeps Congress fully informed of its activities .
Think you are a foosball champion ?
How about stepping your game up to the Table Football XXL ?
There is no information about how long this table actually is , but suffice it to say — you are going to need to bring some friends .
In fact , two full soccer teams ( 22 players ) could go head to head on this thing in what would undoubtedly be an epic foosballing showdown .
Unfortunately , you may never get a chance to try your skill — the Table Football XXL is a one - of - a - kind item built as an advertising stunt for Amstel beer .

Jon Stewart takes on the ' uncensored ' history of the 9/11 Commission Mike Aivaz and Michael Roston
Published : Tuesday February 12 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Jon Stewart hosted the New York Times ' Philip Shenon on Monday night to discuss his new book , The Commission : An Uncensored history of the 9/11 Commission .
The author described White House obstructionism in the course of the officially - mandated Sept. 11 investigation .
" It is remarkable the efforts that the Bush White House went through to try to prevent the 9/11 Commission from getting the information it needed , " Shenon told Stewart .
" The person who was most responsible for that tension was former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales who was then the White House Counsel . "
" Well he 's really matured since then , I do n't know if you 've seen some of his work recently , " Stewart joked in response .
Stewart also asked Shenon about Commission executive director Philip Zelikow and his relationship with Karl Rove .
According to the author , " alarms " went off for the staff when they heard about multiple phone calls Rove had made to Zelikow .
" Then Zelikow calls in his secretary and apparently tells her to stop keeping phone logs of his conversations with the White House , " Shenon explained .
" I 'm sure it 's all innocent stuff , " Stewart quipped .
Reached by the Associated Press , Zelikow provided a 131 - page statement with information he said was provided for the book .
In it , Zelikow acknowledges talking to Rove and Rice during the course of the commission 's work despite a general pledge he made not to .
But he said the conversations never dealt with politics .
A video clip from Monday night 's episode of Comedy Central 's The Daily Show with Jon Stewart is presented below : ( with wire reports )
Federal Communications Commissioner Chair Kevin Martin ascended to the podium at Thursday 's hearing on net neutrality , sounding even more rushed and befuddled than usual .
The FCC " did also invite the carriers to participate in today 's event as well , several weeks ago , " Martin hurriedly explained at Stanford University 's Dinkelspiel Auditorium .
" We did reach out to Comcast , who declined .
We reached out to Time Warner , to Cable Labs , to AT&T . "
In fact , Martin added , the FCC invited Comcast yet again after it announced its " P2P bill of rights and responsibilities " in partnership with Pando Networks — all to no avail .
" So I just want to make sure that everyone understands that we tried to make this as open and as transparent as possible . "
It was just as well .
The absence of the big carriers — especially the aggressive and ever - maneuvering Comcast — allowed a dialogue to take place at Stanford .
A conversation emerged in which the FCC's key players on this complex issue laid out their visions for the agency 's oversight of what ISPs call " network management " and critics call the crude blocking of file sharing applications .
Unlike the agency 's first hearing , held at Harvard Law School on February 25 , this time the Commissioners were up front about what they think the agency should do or not do about the ISP network management problem .
First came Democrat Michael Copps , then Martin 's sometimes Republican ally Robert M. McDowell .
Finally the Chair disclosed his middle - of - the - road map for the Internet 's regulatory future .
Left and Right
Commissioner Michael Copps
Copps followed Martin 's apologia , all fire and brimstone .
" Let 's look at it from an inventor 's perspective , " Copps explained .
Will the broadband pipes for which they develop applications be open to their ideas ?
" Inventors and creators need to know , up front , that they have the right to innovate without going on bended knee to seek permission from a few who have amassed too much control in their own hands , " he said .
The time has come , Copps declared , to beef up the FCC 's 2005 Internet Policy Statement with an " enforceable principle of non-discrimination . "
Something that makes it clear that " we will not tolerate unreasonable discrimination by network operators , " bolstered by enforcement rules " to make sure that anyone with other ideas is n't going to get away with them . "
The FCC 's senior Democrat took a breath .
He conceded that what he advocates wo n't be easy to accomplish .
" These are evolving technologies and sometimes the line between reasonable network management and outright discrimination can be less than crystal clear , " Copps explained .
But that was it for diplomacy .
" I can tell you this , " Copps darkly warned , his right hand slicing the air , " if everyone knew the FCC was on the job , that we had forthrightly staked out our principles , that everyone knew we would deal with any and all complaints that came in , and that those who do discriminate will be punished , word would get out pretty fast that no one should be messing around with the openness of the ' Net . "
Next came Robert M. McDowell , a former telecom lobbyist who advocated for Comcast better than the cable giant ever could for itself .
McDowell defended Comcast 's intentions without any of the bellicosity of Comcast vice president David Cohen , star performer at the FCC's Harvard hearing .
If the ISP truly wanted to interfere with P2P file sharing , would n't it interfere with downloads , not just uploads as Comcast claims ?
McDowell asked .
Would n't it interfere with videos as well ?
The United States is not the only country that suffers from " P2P congestion , " McDowell insisted .
He pointed to Japan , with a far more powerful broadband network than the United States .
" A mere one percent of Japanese users consume more than half of the broadband capacity in that nation , " the Commissioner claimed .
" With widespread 100 M bps service across Japan , the lesson here is that substantially more bandwidth alone in the last mile does not solve the P2P congestion problem .
Something more must be done . "
That something , for McDowell , are the alliances and partnerships emerging as the FCC investigates the problem : the Comcast / BitTorrent agreement and the P4P working group .
" State intrusion into these partnerships will only inhibit future constructive endeavors , " McDowell concluded .
" So to those who argue for more government control , I say be careful what you wish for . "
Martin's center
Then Martin returned with his hints of what might appear in an FCC Order on the issue at hand .
The agency has the authority to deal with the complaints before it about Comcast and other ISPs , Martin insisted .
In the future , the FCC should look towards " several critical factors " in developing an enforcement policy .
First , does the ISP honestly disclose its network management practices ?
" There must be adequate disclosure by the network operators of the particular traffic management tools being used , " Martin said , " not only to consumers , " but " to the designers of various applications and to entrepreneurs . "
Application developers must know " what will and will not work " on the broadband pipes for which they design new devices .
A " second hallmark " of reasonable network management practices " is whether there is arbitrary blocking or degrading of a particular application , " Martin continued .
" As we move into an era in which network operators are taking particular actions against individual applications or content , we need to evaluate those under stricter sets of scrutiny to make sure that whatever actions they 're taking are actually furthering a legitimate purpose , and that their actions are narrowly tailored to serving that legitimate purpose . "
Martin's brief comments fell far short of Copps ' call for an overarching and enforceable net neutrality policy statement .
But they implied a much more critical and regulatory stance than McDowell , who all but urged the agency to walk away from the problem .
Net neutrality , conservative Christian style
With these positions staked out came an eloquent , and , as always , elaborately PowerPointed set of remarks from Stanford 's Lawrence Lessig , followed by two panels of activists , scholars , engineers and entrepreneurs .
But the second half of the hearing was overshadowed by the clarity with which the agency 's Commissioners outlined what they wanted and how far they were willing to go on this issue .
Perhaps the most interesting and unexpected testimony came from Roberta Combs of the Christian Coalition of America , founded by none other than Pat Robertson .
The group 's agenda includes the continued banning of stem cell research , gay marriage , and the extension of President Bush 's tax cuts , scheduled to expire in several years .
" Use of the Internet has allowed the Christian coalition to amplify the voices of millions of hard working , pro-family Americans , in a way that has revolutionized their ability to be heard and to engage in the political process , " Combs told the Commission .
The Internet offers a voice " to even the most modest members of our society to disseminate ideals on a scale traditionally reserved only for the most powerful . "
Then Combs laid into Comcast , recapping the Associated Press ' determination last year that the ISP blocked transmission of a digital version of the King James Bible .
" Unfortunately , in the last six months , we have seen network operators block political speech , block content , and block the most popular applications on the Internet , " she noted .
" If Comcast were to create a Christian Family Channel , would the FCC allow it to block access to a competing product from the Christian Coalition that was distributed by a BitTorrent application ? "
Combs received a big round of applause for her remarks .
Nobody on the Commission answered her question during the panel 's QA period .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Oil jumped more than 3 percent to over $ 116 a barrel on Friday after a report showing the U.S. economy lost fewer jobs than feared in April eased worries about the country ’s economic health .
U.S. crude oil futures for June delivery rose $ 3.80 to settle at $ 116.32 before touching a high of $ 116.49 a barrel in late trade .
London Brent crude gained $ 4.06 to settle at $ 114.56 .
The gains followed three days of losses amid concerns that economic weakness in the United States would continue to blunt world oil demand growth .
World markets cheered a U.S. government report that the economy lost only 20,000 jobs in April , a quarter the number economists had expected .

“ The numbers are still suggesting a mild recession but maybe they ease fears of a deep or prolonged downturn , and to that extent they would be supportive to the oil market , ” said Mike Wittner of Societe Generale .
Earlier , oil prices drew support from renewed clashes between Turkey and Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq .
Turkish air force bombers attacked Kurdish rebel targets overnight , the latest in a series of strikes since Turkish ground troops crossed the Iraqi border in force in February .
Output disruptions in Nigeria and the lingering effects of a strike at Britain ’s Grangemouth refinery that temporarily shut down 700,000 barrels per day of North Sea oil production also lent support to the market .
Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N was restarting 800,000 barrels per day of production in the West African OPEC nation after reaching a deal with workers on Thursday to end the strike .
“ Although the Grangemouth and Nigeria strikes may have been settled , they are only going to further tighten global balances .
The market knows that and it knows it ’s not going to get any more oil out of OPEC , ” said Jim Ritterbusch , president of Ritterbusch and Associates in Galena , Illinois .

( CNN ) --
A pedophile suspect who became the subject of an international manhunt this week after an appeal from Interpol has been detained in the United States .
Wayne Nelson Corliss was arrested at his New Jersey apartment .
Wayne Nelson Corliss , 58 , was arrested at his apartment in Union City , New Jersey , about midnight Wednesday by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents , Interpol said in a written statement .
He is believed to have worked as an actor using the name Casey Wayne and to have worked as a Santa Claus in New York during the holiday season , Interpol said .
Corliss appeared Thursday before a U.S. magistrate in Newark , New Jersey , but did not enter a plea .
During that appearance , prosecutors said he had confessed and acknowledged traveling to Thailand , where on three occasions he abused boys between 6 and 10 years old after using a madam to find them .
Prosecutors said he brought back a pair of boys ' underwear as a souvenir .
It was among items found in his apartment , along with five hard drives containing more than 1,000 images of child pornography , according to prosecutors .
In addition , authorities said Corliss admitted to frequenting online chat rooms that discuss having sex with children .
Interpol announced Tuesday that it was attempting to identify the man , who was featured in 100 photographs sexually abusing at least three boys between the ages of 6 and 10 , it said .
The images came to light in 2006 , when Norwegian authorities discovered them in the possession of a man they arrested .
They were believed to have been taken in Southeast Asia .
Interpol posted six pictures of the suspect on its Web site .
" Two days ago , this man 's nationality , identity and location were totally unknown , " Interpol Secretary General Ronald K. Noble said .
" All we had to go by were a series of graphic photographs in which the suspect was seen sexually abusing young children and our confidence that the public and police worldwide would once again respond to Interpol 's call for assistance .
" That two days later the primary suspect is now in custody is an outstanding achievement and credit to the citizens , media and law enforcement worldwide who responded to Interpol 's call . "
Corliss is charged with producing child pornography , according to prosecutors .
He faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison , with a 10 - year minimum , if convicted in the United States .
Other charges could be sought when the case is presented to a grand jury , said Michael Drewniak , spokesman for the U.S. attorney 's office in New Jersey .
The images found in 2006 were on a computer and stored in a file named " Thai - - Luv , " according to the criminal complaint filed against Corliss , which was released by the Department of Justice .
Data on the images showed that they had been taken in 2000 .
The complaint alleges that the suspect 's face is clearly shown and the background suggests the images were taken in Thailand .
" The images depict an airport luggage tag with the code ' BKK . '
BKK is the luggage tag code for Suvarnabhumi International Airport in Bangkok , Thailand . "
Also shown is a " Chang " water bottle , common in Thailand , the court documents said .
A search of U.S. passport information found an image of Corliss that police compared to the photographs , the complaint said .
" Furthermore , databases maintained by the Department of Homeland Security indicated extensive travel to Asia by defendant Corliss . "
On Wednesday , Interpol said it was sifting through hundreds of tips that had poured in .
The organization , which facilitates global cooperation among police agencies , said Thursday that it received nearly 250,000 visits to its
Web site within the first 24 hours after its appeal was launched -- more than 10 times the daily average .
Such tactics have proved successful for Interpol in the past .
In October , it disseminated pictures of another man whose face -- altered to disguise his identity -- appeared in more than 200 images of sex acts with children , thought to have been taken in Vietnam and Cambodia .
Ten days later , Christopher Paul Neil , a 32 - year - old Canadian who had been working as an English - language teacher in South Korea , was arrested in Thailand and charged with child abuse after police managed to reverse the photo - masking process .
After the success of that operation , Interpol 's general assembly approved a resolution allowing Interpol to seek public help in child sex abuse investigations .
CNN 's Jonathan Wald contributed to this report .
All About Interpol • Sexual Offenses
Mrs Clinton apologised for any offence her remarks may have caused US presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton has apologised for remarks about Robert Kennedy 's 1968 assassination as she defended her continuing nomination bid .
Senator Clinton said she had been attempting to point out that previous campaigns had also continued into June .
Democrat Robert Kennedy was running for his party 's presidential nomination when he was shot dead in June 1968 .
A spokesman for rival Democrat hopeful Barack Obama , whose safety has been an unspoken issue , criticised the remark .
Spokesman Bill Burton called the comments " unfortunate " and said they had " no place in this campaign " .
Moment of trauma Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The comments came in a meeting Mrs Clinton was having with the editorial board of the Sioux Falls Argus - Leader newspaper .
Responding to those who had called on her to withdraw from the Democratic Party 's presidential race , Mrs Clinton said : " My husband did not wrap up the nomination in 1992 until he won the California primary somewhere in the middle of June ...
We all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California .
I do n't understand it . "
Mrs Clinton has made similar comments before , in March , without drawing criticism .
But analysts say the remarks could be damaging given the sensitivities over political assassinations , and fears for the safety of her rival - who began receiving Secret Service protection months before the primary campaign began .
The New York senator later expressed her regret at any offence her comments may have caused .
" I regret that if my referencing that moment of trauma for our entire nation - and in particular the Kennedy family - was in any way offensive .
I certainly had no intention of that whatsoever . "
In the race for the Democratic nomination , Mr Obama has so far won more of the delegates who will choose the party 's candidate at a National Convention in August .
He is now just 56 delegates short of the number needed to clinch the nomination .
The next contest will be a primary in the US territory of Puerto Rico on 1 June , before the final two votes take place in Montana and South Dakota on 3 June .

DNA tests can reveal predisposition to a wide range of diseases The United States Senate has unanimously passed legislation banning discrimination on the basis of people 's genetic details .
The proposal , which passed 95 - 0 , still needs approval from the House of Representatives before it becomes law .
It would allow only patients and their doctors to access data obtained through genetic testing .
Employers , unions and health insurance companies would be forbidden from discrimination via genetic information .
The Democratic Senator Edward Kennedy called it the " the first new civil rights bill of the new century " .
He added : " Discrimination based on a person 's genetic identity is just as unacceptable as discrimination on the basis of race or religion . "
The bill would forbid health insurers from refusing coverage , or raising premiums , for healthy people based on genetic information .
Insurers would also not be allowed to require people to take tests which might show a predisposition to a disease .
And employers would be prohibited from using genetic information in decisions over hiring , firing , promoting or compensating employees .
Genome mapping
The bill is supported by the White House and by health insurers , but opposed by some business interests , including the US Chamber of Commerce .
Scientists hope the legislation will encourage more people to come forward and take genetic tests that might save their lives .
Such tests can lead to therapy for a wide range of diseases with hereditary links , such as cancer , diabetes and heart disease .
With the mapping of the human genome in 2003 , far more information is available about people 's disposition to illnesses .
The Republican sponsor of the bill , Senator Olympia Snowe , said that for the first time steps were being taken " to prevent discrimination before it has taken hold " .
" That 's why this legislation is unique and groundbreaking , " she added .
The genetic tests currently available were " absolutely useless " , she said , if people were not taking them for fear of discrimination .
Employers had previously expressed concern that a bill of this kind would lead to inappropriate claims , but one consolation for insurance companies is that they will still be able to charge higher premiums if someone is already ill when they apply for cover .
The vote in the House of Representatives is expected early next week , after which the bill will go to President George W Bush to be signed into law .

Bear Stearns is one of the best - known US Wall Street firms
Analyst 's reaction JPMorgan Chase is to buy Wall Street 's fifth - largest investment bank , Bear Stearns , for $ 2 a share - a fraction of its previous value .
The news has rattled investors worldwide , who fear that the credit crisis is deepening .
The bank got into trouble over its sub - prime mortgage debts , and other banks had stopped lending to it .
The rescue has been backed by the US Federal Reserve , who will lend $ 30bn and lower its discount rate to 3.25 % .
The discount rate is the rate at which the Fed lends to the banking sector , but the Fed is widely expected to slash interest rates that affect consumers as well - by up to 1 % - when it meets on Tuesday .
Taking inflation into account this would take interest rates into negative territory .
And it has created a new lending facility for big investment banks , who will be able to borrow against the value of their mortgage assets .
Stock markets fell sharply around the world on Monday , with the Hong Kong index down 5 % , the Japanese market nearly 4 % , while London 's FTSE dropped 100 points on its opening .
Credit crunch victim MAIN SUB - PRIME LOSSES SO FAR Citigroup : $ 18bn Merrill Lynch : $ 14.1bn UBS : $ 13.5 bn Morgan Stanley $ 9.4bn HSBC : $ 3.4bn Bear Stearns : $ 3.2bn Deutsche Bank : $ 3.2bn Bank of America : $ 3 bn Barclays : $ 2.6 bn Royal Bank of Scotland : $ 2.6bn Freddie Mac : $ 2bn JP Morgan Chase : $ 3.2 bn Credit Suisse : $ 1bn Wachovia : $ 1.1bn IKB : $ 2.6 bn Paribas : $ 197 m Source : Company reports
Timeline : Sub-prime crisis Q&A : Bear Stearns crisis
The deal values Bear Stearns , which has been at the centre of the US mortgage debt crisis , at just $ 236 m ( £ 116 m ) .
Its shares have lost 98 % of their value since their high of $ 158 in April one year ago , when the bank was worth $ 18 bn .
It means that the former chief executive of the bank , Jimmy Cayne , the richest boss on Wall Street , has seen his fortune plummet from $ 1bn to $ 12 m .
In October , the shares were still worth $ 117 , but by Friday , they had fallen to $ 30 ( £ 15 ) after an emergency rescue package was announced .
Under the deal , which emerged on Sunday , the Federal Reserve will fund up to $ 30bn of Bear Stearns 's less liquid assets .
In turn , JP Morgan will guarantee to meet all the payments due to Bear Stearns clients .
Crisis
The fear was that the collapse of one of the biggest names on Wall Street could have sent shock waves throughout the entire financial system .
Will the Fed 's latest initiatives do the trick ?
That 's very unclear
Robert Peston ,
BBC business editor
Read Robert 's thoughts in full Bear Stearns 's problems stem from the global credit crunch and the worry is that other lenders may also have major funding problems .
Last week , speculation had intensified that the bank was struggling to fund its daily business .
BBC business editor Robert Peston said Bear Stearns was taken to the brink of insolvency last week by a sudden collapse in confidence on the part of its hedge fund clients .
As a result , these clients rushed to withdraw their assets .
' Other banks '
The credit crunch was caused because banks became less willing to lend to each other after they suffered large losses on investments linked to the US housing market , and the sub - prime sector in particular .
But the crisis has now become more general , with other kinds of assets also looking vulnerable .
Sub - prime lenders focus on clients with poor or non-existent credit histories , and a record number of borrowers have defaulted on loans .
The subsequent freezing - up of the credit markets created problems for a number of companies which relied on borrowing money to fund their business .
In the UK , Northern Rock ran into trouble when its line of relatively cheap credit dried up .
At the end of last year , Bear Stearns reported that it had made its first ever quarterly loss after buying investments linked to the US mortgage market .
It was one of the first to admit it had problems linked to sub - prime mortgages , after two of its hedge funds had to be bailed out in July .
Robert Peston said that last week 's move by JPMorgan and the Fed of New York was essentially a central bank bailout , and described the crisis as " America 's Northern Rock " .

Be careful when you start going out on a limb for mercenaries who start wars for " fun " and get paid in " pots of diamonds . "
You 're liable to get your heart handed to you .
Just ask Robert Young Pelton .
In the latest Men's Journal , Pelton chronicles his epic journey to help free his friend and gun -for - hire , Nick du Toit , from an African prison , after he had been convicted of trying to overthrow a bloodthirsty dictator .
The story , " My Friend , the Mercenary From Hell , " is n't online , yet .
But here 's an excerpt , to get your ass out of your chair and over to a newsstand .**
The best way to spring someone from jail , I knew , was to figure out how release would benefit the jailer .
That usually meant offering a bribe or a swap , or making an appeal for clemency .
A jailbreak was a dangerous last resort , but Nick being who he was , his friends kept in touch and were standing by if he needed to be rescued .
I said I would try the diplomatic route first .
Why me ?
One of Nick ’s South African army mates went to EG [ Equatorial Guinea ] just for a visit and the security police , incredulous at his audacity , sent him directly to jail .
In January of 2006 , I contacted President Obiang ’s Paris - based lawyer , Henry Page .
His job had been to convict Nick and arrange for the extradition of his co-conspirator , Simon Mann , who had been the alleged mastermind of the coup attempt .
I was frank about my friendship with Nick and my goal .
From what Nick ’s friends had told me , I suspected that Nick knew more about the coup ’s backers than had come out in the trial , and that he had tried to walk away from the plot in its final days .
If I got Nick to lay out the whole story , exposing the real planners , would the President reduce his sentence or even pardon him ?
After all , they were free men ; that had to rankle , and cause a few sleepless nights , for Obiang .
Page seemed open to the discussion so I flew to Paris to meet with him at his elegant 18th century office .
The product of the best English public schools , he reminded me of a grown - up Harry Potter .
His impeccably polite demeanor disguised his willingness to get his hands dirty — as evidenced by his client list .
After a few days , Page had a response for me :
Yes , the President will meet with you .
A first - class ticket materialized and we flew to Malabo .
On arrival , a dark blue Toyota Land Cruiser with presidential plates whisked us to a large Presidential villa supplied for our use .
A guide named Juan showed Page and me around and I realized how out - of - date the descriptions of the country I ’d read actually were .
The scale of oil - financed new development was staggering .
So was the poverty .
Bentleys splashed through open sewers , while American oil workers in Tony Lama cowboy boots counted the days until the flight home to Houston .
At last , Juan got the call we ’d been waiting for : I ’d been summoned by the President and was flown to the mainland , 45 minutes away .
In the waiting room a slight 30 something Lebanese man answered his cell phone incessantly .
Potbellied ministers in ill - fitting suits clutched their portfolios and tried not to sweat too much .
At last I got the nod to enter the inner sanctum .
The NCAA issued new rules this week that will allow credentialed press to blog live NCAA championship sporting events .
The rules , however , limit the number of times reporters can post live blogs depending on the sport they cover .
A Kentucky newspaper reporter was ejected from an NCAA baseball regional championship game in June for live - blogging the event .
The NCAA contended then that live - blogging violated its policies with regard to " live representation of the game . "
The new NCAA rules ( download PDF ) allow credentialed reporters to live - blog championship events as long as they limit their posts to those outlined in the rules .
For example , a reporter can blog three times per quarter and once at half - time for NCAA football games and five times per half and once at half - time for NCAA basketball games .
Two live posts are allowed per overtime period for basketball .
In baseball , live - blogging is allowed once per inning .
The rules also stipulate that live - bloggers must link their posts to the NCAA 's Blog Central site and include an NCAA sports log on their blog sites .
Mike Masnick , president and CEO of IT research firm Techdirt , argued in a blog that the new rules make no sense and only serve to hurt the sport .
" The people who follow live blogs are the really passionate fans the ones who love the game the most , " he wrote .
" They follow the live blogs not as a substitute for watching the game on TV or attending in person but because they cannot view the games that way and / or they want to feel the camaraderie of discussing the event with other passionate fans .
Cutting off the ability of a reporter to feed info to these fans simply makes no sense .
It 's hurting your most passionate fans for no good reason whatsoever . "

NAIROBI , Kenya , Sept. 8 - Biologists warned Thursday that a virulent new strain of a previously controlled plant disease had emerged in East Africa and could wipe out 10 percent of the world 's wheat production if its spread is not halted .
The disease , wheat rust , caused huge grain losses and even famines in the first half of the 20th century .
The new strain was discovered in Uganda in 1999 and has since spread to Kenya and Ethiopia , damaging wheat crops there .
The fungus that causes wheat rust , Puccinia graminis , produces a rusty color on the stem of wheat and slowly destroys the plant .
It was controlled in the late 1950's and 1960's through the groundbreaking work of Norman Borlaug , an American who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for developing high - yield grains that led to the green revolution .
Dr. Borlaug , now 91 , spoke at a news conference on Thursday in Nairobi and called to draw attention to the new threat .

I swear to you , if you listen to what they say in this little mashup by Heather , that 's exactly what they 're saying , if you belong to the reality - based community , which sadly , leaves out the entire FOXNews viewership .
In discussing the NY Times story on McCain 's relationship with lobbyist (s ) , Billo wants McCain to confront the media 's politics of destruction because he 's disgusted , disgusted , I tell you ! , by how low the media has sunk .
Anyone have a mirror for Mr. O'Reilly ?
Okay , so you say , go after your opponent , rather than the media , which a lot of people do n’t even care about .
Alright , I wanted to get your … you know , ‘ cause I ’m so angry with … and it ’s personal with me , because obviously I ’m in the profession .
You know it would be personal with you too if you see corruption in politics when you were Speaker of the House .
You get … I … I am so disgusted with American journalism right now in this country .
It is so corrupt , it is so massively corrupt and such a violation of the privileges the Founding Fathers have given us in the media .
I ca n’t tell you how sick to my stomach I am .
So I ’m probably … I ’m probably clouded by that .
I agree , Bill .
The violation by the media on FOX has made me nauseated more than once as well .
Contract On With America architect Newt Gingrich is similarly blessed with a complete lack of self - reflection when looking at how McCain could appeal to voters : by rejecting the governing that Newtster implemented with McCain for the last 25 years .
Who said irony was dead ?
O’REILLY : Because the phenomenon is that some Americans feel that they have never been represented by the white guys of privilege , who have been President .
Now I would n’t call President Clinton that , he certainly was n’t a guy of privilege .
And then they see a guy who they believe is going to be more concerned with them than politics as usual .
And that ’s what your book is about .
And I think that ’s why your book a huge bestseller for you because you do say we have to get away from what we ’ve had for the last 30 years in this country , right ?
GINGRICH : Yeah , I think that ’s the biggest challenge for Senator McCain .
I wrote Real Change to outline the scale of change we really need and I think if you look at it , step by step , we have a platform with the American people in there that has absolute support by Democrats , Republicans and Independents and the objective fact is the average American is not happy with where they are , they want a different energy strategy , a different education strategy , a different health strategy and that will require real change .
I do n't know about you , but it sounds to me like Newt does n't think we want McCain ( aka Bush 2.0 ) .
The platform he 's espousing sounds ...oh I do n't know , almost Democratic , does n't it ?
The National Geographic Society and the international polling firm GlobeScan today unveiled a new mechanism for measuring and comparing individual consumer behavior as it relates to the environment .
" Greendex ™ 2008 : Consumer Choice and the Environment -- A Worldwide Tracking Survey " looks at environmentally sustainable consumption and behavior among consumers in 14 countries .
This first - of - its - kind study reveals surprising differences between consumers in developed and developing countries in terms of environmentally friendly actions .
This year 's results are a baseline against which results of future annual surveys will be compared , in order to monitor improvements or declines in environmentally sustainable consumption at both the global level and within countries .
The Greendex survey was conducted online earlier this year among 14,000 consumers in Australia , Brazil , Canada , China , France , Germany , Great Britain , Hungary , India , Japan , Mexico , Russia , Spain and the United States .
A panel of 27 international experts in global sustainability helped identify which consumer behaviors were most crucial to investigate .
One thousand people in each country answered questions that measured their behavior in the areas of housing , transportation , food and consumption of goods ; each respondent earned a score that reflected the environmental impact of his or her consumption patterns , which included size and energy - efficiency of residence , commuting mode and distance and use of fresh water , among dozens of other measures .
Consumers were then assigned a Greendex score ( a measure of the relative environmental sustainability of their consumption patterns ) out of 100 .
Consumers in Brazil and India scored highest ; U.S. consumers scored lowest .
Greendex vs. Other Environmental Studies
Unlike other measures that rank countries according to the environmental performance of their governments , businesses and other factors , the Greendex is the first to rank the performance of individual consumers , rather than countries as a whole .
The results are strikingly different from existing performance rankings like the Environmental Performance Index , the Environmental Sustainability Index or Ecological Footprint .
" The Greendex gives us an unprecedented , meaningful look at how consumers across the globe are behaving , " said Terry Garcia , National Geographic 's executive vice president of Mission Programs .
" It will allow us over time to assess the progress that people are making to conserve , minimize waste and protect natural resources for the future .
Consumers who score highest have a responsibility to maintain their behavior and provide an example to those who need to improve .
We hope the study inspires all consumers , particularly those in countries where consumers scored lowest , to adopt the best behaviors of those who scored well , and that consumers in countries with expanding economies , who may consume more in the future , will do so responsibly . "
Determining Consumption
Consumption as measured by the Greendex is determined both by the choices consumers actively make -- such as repairing rather than replacing items , using cold water to wash laundry , choosing green products rather than environmentally unfriendly ones -- and choices that are controlled more by their circumstances -- such as the climate they live in or the availability of green products or public transport .
The initiative considered both of these factors , with 60 percent of the 65 - variable index based on choice or discretionary behavior .

" The Greendex shows us that consumers ' choices play a large role in their environmental footprint .
Governments and businesses , therefore , have a responsibility to ensure that environmentally friendly options are available and affordable to all consumers , especially those in the developing countries , whose index rankings may fall as economies grow and consumption patterns change , " said Thomas Lovejoy , president of the Heinz Center for Science , Economics and the Environment , chairman of National Geographic 's Conservation Trust and an adviser to the Greendex project .
GlobeScan President Doug Miller added , " The Greendex initiative is ground - breaking .
Never before has such a comprehensive survey been applied across a wide range of countries to scientifically track consumer behaviors related to the environment .
While other surveys look at attitudes and intentions , the Greendex tracks actions that matter . "
Consumer Greendex Rankings by Country
The findings show that consumers in Brazil and India tie for the highest Greendex score for environmentally sustainable consumption at 60 points each .
They are followed by consumers in China ( 56.1 ) , Mexico ( 54.3 ) , Hungary ( 53.2 ) and Russia ( 52.4 ) .
Among consumers in wealthy countries , those in Great Britain , Germany and Australia each have a Greendex score of 50.2 , those in Spain register a score of 50.0 and Japanese respondents , 49.1 .
U.S. consumers have the lowest Greendex score at 44.9 .
The other lowest - scoring consumers are Canadians with 48.5 and the French with 48.7 .
There are signs that index rankings are set to change as people in developing countries become more economically successful and adopt more consumptive behaviors .
Findings show that consumers in countries with emerging economies aspire to higher material standards of living and believe people in all countries should have the same living standards as those in the wealthiest countries .

Consumers in Developing vs. Developed Countries
While the survey found encouraging signs that individuals in all the surveyed countries feel empowered when it comes to the environment and are taking some action in their daily lives to reduce consumption and waste , it found that those in developing countries are the most concerned and that the behavior and personal choices of consumers in developing countries were more environmentally friendly than those in developed countries .
Consumers in developing countries feel more responsible for environmental problems than those in developed countries , and six in 10 people in developing countries report that environmental problems are negatively affecting their health -- twice as many as in most developed countries .
Moreover , consumers in developing countries feel strongest that global warming will worsen their way of life in their lifetime , are the most engaged when it comes to talking and listening about the environment , feel the most guilt about their environmental impact and are willing to do the most to minimize that impact .
Their behavior reflects their concern .
People in developing countries are more likely to :
Live in smaller residences ;
Prefer green products and own relatively few appliances or expensive electronic devices ;
Walk , cycle , or use public transportation , and choose to live close to their most common destination .
By contrast , consumers in developed countries , who have more environmentally friendly options to choose from , often do n't make those choices .
They have larger homes and are more likely to have air - conditioning .
They generally own more cars , drive alone most frequently and use public transport infrequently .
They are least likely to buy environmentally friendly products and to avoid environmentally unfriendly products .
U.S. consumers scored worse than those in any other country , developing or developed , on housing , transportation and goods .
They are by far the least likely to use public transportation , to walk or bike to their destinations or to eat locally grown foods .
They have among the largest average residence size in the survey .
Only 15 percent say they minimize their use of fresh water .
Discover Your Greendex Score
Individuals around the world can find out where they rank on the Greendex scale by visiting http://nationalgeographic.com/greendex and taking an abbreviated survey .
They can also examine the Greendex survey results by country , measure their knowledge of some basic green issues against what others around the world know , and get tips on living a more environmentally friendly lifestyle .
" National Geographic has been committed to caring for the environment for many years , and part of our mission is to help people understand how they can reduce their impact on the planet .
We hope people will be inspired to look at how their own behavior is affecting the environment and take steps to minimize their environmental footprint , " the Society 's Terry Garcia said .
Market Basket
To provide context for the Greendex results , National Geographic and GlobeScan also developed a " Market Basket , " a set of national macroeconomic indicators of consumption in four areas important to environmentally sustainable behavior -- energy , transportation , travel and consumer goods .
The data , gathered by the Economist Intelligence Unit , mirrors in part the consumer behavior measured by the Greendex survey .
The purpose of the Market Basket is to provide an external estimate of changes in consumer behavior over time , while acknowledging that industry and government also play a critical role .
The Greendex , for example , measures things consumers are doing to save energy in a country ; the Market Basket measures whether total energy consumption in the country is actually going up or down .
The Market Basket will also establish a framework for comparing the relative environmental impact of each country 's size and rate of growth , over time .
Current Market Basket data validate the 2008 Greendex rankings , with actual energy consumption aligned with each country 's Greendex score .
More importantly , however , the Market Basket data suggest that if current growth rates are sustained in certain countries in 2008 , Greendex rankings may change considerably in the near future .
JERUSALEM  Israel and Syria announced on Wednesday that they were engaged in negotiations for a comprehensive peace treaty through Turkish mediators , a sign that Israel is hoping to halt the growing influence of Iran , Syria ’s most important ally , which sponsors the anti-Israel groups Hezbollah and Hamas .
Senior Israeli officials from Prime Minister Ehud Olmert ’s office and their Syrian counterparts were in Istanbul on Wednesday , where both groups had been staying separately , at undisclosed locations , since Monday .
The mediators shuttled between the two .
Syria and Israel have not negotiated this seriously in eight years .
Syria ’s motives are clear : it wants to regain the Golan Heights , captured by Israel in the 1967 war , and to re-establish a relationship with the United States , something it figures it can do through talks with Jerusalem .
For Israel  which has watched the Palestinian group Hamas take over Gaza and gain ground in the West Bank , and the Lebanese group Hezbollah display raw power in Beirut  an effort to pull Syria away from Iran could produce enormous benefits .
An announcement on Wednesday of a peace deal that gives Hezbollah the upper hand in Lebanon ’s government probably added to Israel ’s sense of urgency .
As governor and viceroy of the Indies , Columbus imposed iron discipline on the first Spanish colony in the Americas , in what is now the Caribbean country of Dominican Republic .
Punishments included cutting off people 's ears and noses , parading women naked through the streets and selling them into slavery .
" Columbus ' government was characterised by a form of tyranny , " Consuelo Varela , a Spanish historian who has seen the document , told journalists .
One man caught stealing corn had his nose and ears cut off , was placed in shackles and was then auctioned off as a slave .
A woman who dared to suggest that Columbus was of lowly birth was punished by his brother Bartolomé , who had also travelled to the Caribbean .
She was stripped naked and paraded around the colony on the back of a mule .
" Bartolomé ordered that her tongue be cut out , " said Ms Varela .
" Christopher congratulated him for defending the family . "
The evidence has been found in a previously lost report drawn up at the time for the Spanish monarchs as they became worried by growing rumours of Columbus ' barbarity and avarice .
The document was written by a member of an order of religious knights , the Order of Calatrava , who had been asked to investigate the allegations against Columbus by Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand , who ruled Spain together at the time .
The report , by Francisco de Bobadilla , lay undiscovered in a state archive in the Spanish city of Valladolid until last year .
Bobadilla had already been named governor of the Indies , replacing Columbus , at the time of the report .
The 48 - page document gathers evidence from Columbus ' enemies and supporters of his seven - year reign .
Ms Varela , one of the two Spanish historians to have studied the document , described life in the colony as " horrifying and hard " .
Bobadilla collected the testimonies of 23 people who had seen or heard about the treatment meted out by Columbus and his brothers .
" Even those who loved him had to admit the atrocities that had taken place , " Ms Varela said .
Columbus and his brothers were forced to travel back to Spain .
Columbus was in chains but , although he never recovered his titles , he was set free and allowed to sail back to the Caribbean .
" Columbus and his brothers come across in the text as tyrants , " Ms Varela said .
" Now one can understand why he was sacked and we can see that there were good reasons for doing so .
" The monarchs wanted someone who did not give them problems .
Columbus did not solve problems , he created them . "

As he dipped his hand into the River Wear to quench his thirst , William Sproat could not have known he was about to unleash the horror of cholera on Britain .
Sunderland in 1831 was a hectic place .
The Industrial Revolution was redefining our cities , while filth and squalor grew with urban populations .
A robust boatman , Sproat spent his working life plying the Wear in heavily loaded coal barges .
He did not know that a deadly bacteria lurked in its depths .
Within hours of drinking from the river , Sproat was racked by vomiting fits and excruciating stomach cramp .
Most water - borne diseases kill , ironically , by dehydrating their victims .
Sproat 's wife and two children watched in horror as his pulse faded and his face took on a deathly pallor .
Cholera strikes quickly .
Within a day or two , its victims are writhing , immobilised in its terrifying grip .
The parasite that causes the disease comes to life in the warmth of the human gut and depends on its unfortunate host for survival .
Three days later , there was so little blood flowing to Sproat 's brain that he fell into a coma .
As death moved in , his fingers and legs turned dark blue .
Scroll down for more ...
Dr Robert Morris says that we should all use water filters in our homes which are properly installed and maintained - they give water that is often safer than bottled water
On the night of October 23 , Sproat succumbed to the ' blue death ' of cholera .
Within hours , the highly contagious disease also had the boatman 's son and granddaughter in its awful grasp .
Asiatic cholera had arrived in Britain ; Sproat was its first victim .
Soon , the country was in the grip of an epidemic - but no one knew what caused this disease , or how to cure it .
Desperate relatives tried every potential remedy : emetics to induce vomiting , enemas made with turpentine in gruel , or a poultice of bran wrapped around the legs of the victim .
With winter , cholera receded in the UK , but it continued to ravage warmer climes .
By 1846 , it had taken hold in the Middle East , killing 12,000 people in Tehran and 30,000 in Baghdad .
In just one night in 1847 , 3,000 pilgrims died at Mecca in Saudi Arabia .
In 1848 , it returned with a vengeance to British shores .
What was causing this virulent disease ?
The prevailing medical science of the time suggested it must be caused by a miasma , a foul smelling , airborne poison .
A British doctor , John Snow , suspected otherwise .
In 1849 , he put forward his theory that cholera is spread through microscopic agents in water .
He tracked an outbreak in Soho , central London , to a single public pump .
A total of 623 people died in this outbreak - before Dr Snow removed the handle from the Broad Street pump , stopping people using it and thus halting cholera in its tracks .
This was a medical breakthrough which redefined our understanding of the world .
Initially , Dr Snow was greeted with derision and disbelief , but his work led to a revolution in the way we look at our water supplies .
His early research inspired my investigation into modern - day water and its impact on our health .
Beneath the world 's streets , water races through pipes to fill tens of billions of glasses and bottles each day .
This year , the Government has launched a campaign to curb the £ 2 billion we spend each year on bottled water and opt instead for ' safe ' tap water .
But how safe is it ?
For millions of years , intimate knowledge about the source of water was among the most important pieces of information our ancestors carried .
Perhaps they were wiser men than we .
Today , that intimacy is lost .
We turn on a tap and water flows as if by magic .
Most of us have little awareness of its source .
We assume it will be there .
We assume it will be safe .
The road to disaster is paved with assumptions .
We assume waterborne disease happens in the developing world , yet the largest outbreak of such a disease in U.S. history happened in 1993 , in Milwaukee , Wisconsin .
An outbreak of illness caused by cryptosporidium , a micro-organism in water that causes stomach upsets , hit 400,000 .
Some 4,000 people were hospitalised , and more than 100 died .
Evidence is mounting that our Government has underestimated the risks from cryptosporidium .
A detailed report on an outbreak of the disease in Oxfordshire in 1989 - when 400 people required treatment - criticised Whitehall and the water industry for dragging their feet over research .
The only thing that separates us from more outbreaks is the system we have developed to transport and treat sewage and drinking water .
The operation of our water supplies is , to most of us , invisible .
Invisibility encourages complacency .
We have come to think of these systems as fail - safe , but the technology for treating most of our drinking water is almost a century old .
Most water purification plants were not originally designed to remove chemical contaminants .
At least some of the water from these ageing plants is treated sewage .
Farm run-off and industrial waste also get into treatment tanks .
Studies have shown that some of the bacteria from these sources make their way into drinking water supplies , causing illness .
Between 1993 and 2003 , there were 4,000 officially recorded incidents of waterborne disease in Britain .
The real figure is likely to be far higher .
Around half those cases were caused by cryptosporidium .
These diseases are not as deadly as cholera , but it is possible this may not always hold true .
And the question remains : how can we ensure that our drinking water is clean enough ?
Should we be drinking treated sewage ?
Sewage treatment decreases the number of disease - carrying bacteria , called pathogens , in waste water , but it does not eliminate them .
Instead , water companies dangerously assume any pathogens in their supplies will disappear in vast reservoirs or die before they can reach the intake pipe .
The history of drinking water is a story of disaster and response .
From cholera to cryptosporidium , disasters have forced change .
We now face new risks : emerging diseases , changing climates , poorly understood pollutants , terrorism , decaying infrastructure and ' gender bending ' chemicals .
In 2002 , U.S. researchers found 82 different pharmaceutical compounds in lakes and rivers .
This and other studies have found oestrogen - the female sex hormone - to be one of the most commonly found chemicals .
Many of these chemicals have also been found in water supplies across the UK , while scientists have shown that oestrogen in water supplies alters the sex of fish in rivers .
Many other chemicals widely present in waste water have been shown to mimic the effects of oestrogen .
All of these chemicals can - and do - reach water treatment plants , most of which were not designed to remove them .
Whether these chemicals are present in drinking water at concentrations high enough to affect human health remains a controversial subject - but the risk is there .
Another danger is toxoplasmosis , a chlorine - resistant bacteria which causes flu - like symptoms initially , but can spread and cause devastating damage to the delicate neurological network in the brain .
It causes blindness , mental retardation and even death .
Then there is the issue of ' chlorination ' itself , the process designed to disinfect water .
A mainstay of water treatment , adding chlorine to our supply appears to create chemicals that cause cancer and may injure developing human embryos .
There is evidence it may lead to miscarriage and even birth defects .
A recent study suggesting the cancer risk may arise from inhalation of fumes , rather than ingestion , makes this even more daunting .
At the same time , chlorine resistant pathogens are developing .
Then there is the problem of chemical pollution of our water .
Modern industry produces and releases tens of thousands of different chemicals into our water supplies .
Regulators focus on single chemicals as they evaluate risk and set standards .
Logistics and costs tend to limit their scope to the carcinogenic offenders .
As a consequence , we make the implicit assumption that unexamined risks do not exist .
Terrorism is the newest threat to our water .
In February 2002 , four terrorists were seized in a Rome apartment with sealed containers holding four kilos of a cyanide compound .
Beside it lay a map of the city 's water distribution system , and the location of the U.S. embassy .
A raid by the Italian anti-terrorist squad thwarted this attack , but it highlighted a new and dangerous risk to our water supplies .
So what can be done to make our water safer ?
Bottled water is not the answer .
The production of all that plastic has a hefty environmental impact , causing more water pollution .
The water inside may not offer the benefits we imagine .
Despite costing almost 1,000 times more than tap water , there is no guarantee that bottled water is safer .
It is less closely regulated than tap water , and is not required to meet stricter standards for purity .
Instead , we should be relying on a safe , local supply of water .
Improvements to our system need to include a vigorous effort to develop and implement alternatives to chlorination , such as treatment with ozone , a blue gas which is a powerful and less toxic disinfectant .
We should all use water filters in our homes .
Properly installed and maintained , they provide an extra measure of protection and give water that is often safer than bottled water , with far less environmental impact .
They can eliminate pathogens that our treatment plants fail to remove and protect us from chemicals and the by - products of chlorination .
Every waterborne outbreak I have studied could have been prevented by the universal use of home filters .
We also need to be more demanding of our water companies .
There is better technology available than we are using at the moment , including filter systems that squeeze water through tiny hollow fibres and out through holes 200 times smaller than cryptosporidium .
But it is expensive , and few water firms worldwide invest in the equipment .
Why should they when we seem content to drink what they give us ?
We also need to develop realistic plans for sustainable water supplies or we will find a planet at war over water .
Think when you next turn on the tap .
Water is the ultimate resource .
The world has it in abundance , but accessible , safe water is scarce , and we would be wise to protect it .
Instead , we have forgotten the lessons of history and expect our water supply to work as we focus on other problems .
We do so at our peril .
Spam now makes up more than 80 % of mail message traffic Spam - the scourge of every e-mail inbox - celebrates its 30th anniversary this weekend .
The first recognisable e-mail marketing message was sent on 3 May , 1978 to 400 people on behalf of DEC - a now - defunct computer - maker .
The message was sent via Arpanet - the internet 's forerunner - and won its sender much criticism from recipients .
Thirty years on , spam has grown into an underground industry that sends out billions of messages every day .
Statistics gathered by the FBI suggest that 75 % of net scams snare people through junk e-mail .
In 2007 these cons netted criminals more than $ 239 m ( £ 121 m ) .
Statistics suggest that more than 80 % - 85 % of all e-mail is spam or junk and more than 100 billion spam messages are sent every day .
The majority of these messages are being sent via hijacked home computers that have been compromised by a computer virus .
Quick complaint
The sender of the first junk e-mail message was Gary Thuerk and it was sent to advertise new additions to DEC 's family of System - 20 minicomputers .
It invited the recipients , all of whom were on Arpanet and lived on the west coast of the US , to go to one of two presentations showing off the capabilities of the System - 20 .
Reaction to the message was swift , with complaints reportedly coming from the US Defense Communications Agency , which oversaw Arpanet , and took Mr Thuerk 's boss to task about it .
Despite Mr Thuerk 's pioneering spam it took many years for unsolicited commercial e-mail to become a nuisance .
It took until 1993 before it won the name of spam - a name bestowed on it by Joel Furr - an administrator on the Usenet chat system .
Mr Furr reputedly got his inspiration for the name from a Monty Python sketch set in a restaurant whose menu heavily featured the processed meat .
The sketch ended with everyone in the restaurant , encouraged by a troupe of chanting Vikings , shouting : " Spam . Spam . Spam . Spam . Spam . "
April 1994 saw another pioneering moment in the history of spam when immigration lawyers Canter and Siegel sent a commercial spam message to more than 6,000 Usenet discussion groups .
The Canter and Siegel e-mail is widely seen as the moment when the commercialisation of the net began and opened the floodgates that led to the deluge of spam seen today .
Since those days spam has grown to be a nuisance and is now used by many hi-tech crime gangs as the vehicle for a variety of scams and cons .
" Spam is a burden on all of us , " said Graham Cluley , senior technology consultant at Sophos .
" What 's worse is that a lot of spam is deliberately malicious today , aiming to steal your bank account information or install malware . "

An Intermittent Wind Powered Generator
( New Concept )
April 2008
Picture above shows :
At one point above ground , natural wind does not always blow at same speed and towards one precise direction .
In fact , wind blows intermittently .
At one moment , wind speed is high , the next moment the wind speed is slow down .
Sometimes wind speed changes violently .
Directions of wind is also not precise , it changes from time to time .
This is intermittent wind .
Normal wind generators prefer to work in continuously wind and in one direction .
In order to make normal wind generators work more efficient , most of generators installed some kind of devices to reduce effects of intermittent wind , such as : install a tail , place blades at high place ...
Unlike normal wind generators ,
This generator is powered by natural intermittent wind .
As pictures above show .
A kite - like object ( 1 ) to catch wind power is at one end of a wire ( 8 ) , a weighted object ( 3 ) at other end of wire ( 8 ) .
When wind ( 4 ) blows very slowly , or wind direction is suddenly changed , kite - like object ( 1 ) caught less wind force .
Weight ( force of gravity ) of object ( 3 ) is greater than wind force on kite - like object ( 1 ) , object ( 3 ) will go down and drag kite - like object ( 1 ) back , see arrow ( 5 ) .
When wind speed is high , wind ( 4 ) pushes kite - like object ( 1 ) towards wind ’s direction hardly , wind force on object ( 1 ) is greater than force of gravity on object ( 3 ) and pulls object ( 3 ) up .
As nature wind ’s speed and direction change from time to time , the object ( 3 ) will go up and down repeatedly .
This kind of up and down movement can be used to power an electricity generator or other appliances , such as water pump ...
Force of gravity on object ( 3 ) can be adjusted by changing its weight .
Shape , size and material of kite - like object ( 1 ) also can be changed in order to decide how much wind force can be caught .
In other words , wind force caught by kite - like object ( 1 ) is depending on its design .
Before this intermittent wind powered generator starts to work , there is a balance between force of gravity on object ( 3 ) and wind force on object ( 1 ) .
If shape , size and material of kite - like object ( 1 ) are decided , in order to get the balance , weight of object ( 3 ) should be adjusted .
If the weight of object ( 3 ) is fixed , then design of object ( 1 ) should be changed to get the balance .
Intermittent wind force on object ( 1 ) often breaks the balance from time to time and cause repeatedly up and down movement of object ( 3 ) .
Advantage of this generator is :
It is very simple , also cheaper to be made .
No expensive blades and other contral system are needed .
Disadventage of this generator is : Power output is also intermittent ( not continuously ) .
We built a small version of test model of this generator on my window at a secound floor room .
In this test model , the weighted object ( 3 ) is replaced by a magnet .
The magent will moving inside a coil .
The object ( 1 ) is replaced by a toy kite .
It looks like working from time to time .
This intermittent wind power generator works based on three elements :
1. Speed and direction of natural wind change from time to time .
The wind force caught kite - like object ( 1 ) also changed form time to time .
2 . How much wind force can be caught by kite - like object ( 1 ) is depending on its shape , size and material .
Some design of object ( 1 ) may catch more wind power , other design of object ( 1 ) may catch less wind power .
If size of kite is larger , lower speed wind is needed to pull the weight object ( 3 ) up .
Shape of kite - like object ( 1 ) is also very important :
We tried plactic shoping bags , balloon ... and found strange shape of kite may help to break the balance easily .
3 . Force of gravity on object ( 3 ) .
The weight of object ( 3 ) can be adjusted , for example add another magnet or attract some metal items on magnet .
A toy kite bought from £ 1 shop .
A short video on Youtube shows some working moments of this test model .
Here
But there are many questions to be answered about this generator :
(1) What will happen , if this intermittent wind powered generator is in much large scale ?
(2) What kind shape , size and materail of the kite - like object ( 1 ) are the best ?
Specially in very larger scale ?
Biger size may work better in low wind speed weather , but may too big in strong wind weather ?
(3) What will happen if more magnets and more coils in this system ?
(4) Can this system be used to pump water from low level to high level ?
******** ********
Other people think about this idea : From Lee ( 25 April 2008 ) ( USA )
That 's an interesting idea .
I wonder what the most fluttery form in the wind would be .
I can imagine a wall made from piping with a bunch of these things ....
If the flutter parts were all different colors it would be pretty to watch too like a great big animated wall of flowers !
Also you might want to mount the coils on back of the feed tube itself and use a small light spring to pull the magnet back instead of gravity .... it would take up less space and give a more reliable movement I think .
Jeanna ( 25 April 2008 ) ( country unkown )
good idea ; I will make one .
what about a sail on a mast with a couple of lines ?
Ben ( 24 April 2008 ) ( UK )
There is not that much power to be harnessed with this design einsteinian ( 28 April 2008 ) ( Youtube )
Hi , I like the idea / concept .
I noticed something watching it and wanted to suggest another version .
I noticed that the kite likes to stay floating which causes the magnet to spend most of the time in a holding pattern either in or out .
I also noticed stronger and tighter pulling force on the tube than the string .
My thought , connect kite - tube - magnet like @ --- o firm , then place magnet end into coil .
let me know if you want more info to try it , anyways nice project / video .
**** Reply to this message : Yes , this system is working intermittently .
I think we can change the design of kite - like object , to make the kite much easy to un - balance in blowing wind .
The shape of the kite I am thinking , is like a big disc , with a wire in center .
This kind of shape is very un-even .
But I did not test it yet .
Regards From Makezine Blog Editor ( 28 April 2008 ) ( USA )
This is a fairly inexpensive way to generate power from intermittent wind .
This is n't going to power your computer , but it is an interesting concept .
I would like to see hundreds of these used to generate power at a more usable level .
me2000r ( 29 Apr 2008 ) ( Youtube )
One could provide some means of varying the counterweight based on average wind speed , in order to more accurately ' balance ' the wind - catching device and the counterweight based on current wind conditions .
This should make the system more efficient .
Also , consider using a balloon - shape for the wind catcher .
Jonathan ( 30 April 2008 ) ( UK )
I will put a link to it from my flutter gen page if its ok with you :
http://www.creative-science.org.uk/sharp_flutter.html
I think it would be a great project for someone who lives high up , say in a tower block .
I have tried using a plastic bags as a wind sock like you have and it worked but I think I never had enough wind really .
sturgeon333 ( 01 May 2008 ) ( Youtube )
If you add a spring you might make it more efficient .
Once the kite pulls the string out fully no more energy is being captured .
With a spring you could store some extra energy that gives the magnet a stronger rebound when the wind slows .

This evening Attorney General Michael Mukasey , as expected , refused to prosecute the contempt of Congress resolutions against White House officials Josh Bolten and Harriet Miers for their refusal to testify in the U.S. attorneys scandal .
The House had referred the contempt citations to the Department of Justice only yesterday .
In response to Mukasey ’s refusal , Speaker Nancy Pelosi promised to pursue a civil lawsuit to enforce the congressional subpoenas .
House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers issued a statement saying :
[ T] odayâs decision to shelve the contempt process , in violation of a federal statute , shows that the White House will go to any lengths to keep its role in the US Attorney firings hidden .
In the face of such extraordinary actions , we have no choice but to proceed with a lawsuit to enforce the Committee ’s subpoenas.â 
Our exhaustive coverage of this story is here .
People use maths up to 14 times a day , the survey said
Women are less confident than men , with one in three struggling to add up sums in their head , compared to 18 % of men , the poll of 2,000 adults found .
Some 47 % of those polled wished they had learnt more maths at school , the survey for numeracy campaign charity Every Child Counts suggested .
And more than half of women asked maths questions by their children or family said they struggled to answer them .
Adult innumeracy was one of the greatest scourges facing the country
John Griffiths - Jones
Every Child a Chance
The findings tie in with earlier research that suggests a large chunk of the adult population has problems doing basic maths .
This is problematic as it is estimated that these skills are needed up to 14 times a day .
The survey suggested one in five adults aged 25 to 34 said they felt a greater ability in maths would further them in their career .
Severe difficulties with maths were spread across the social classes .
Some 3 % of those working in professional , administrative and managerial jobs and 4 % of those in skilled and unskilled manual trades said they struggled with mental maths in shops most of the time .
A third of those in lower social groups polled said they felt uncomfortable in shops some of the time , compared to 25 % in the top social groups .
' Scourge '
Those aged over 55 were the most confident at 77 % , compared to 64 % of the 25 - 34 - year - olds who were the least confident .
Adults taking part in the poll were also asked a mathematical question : what is the square root of 64 ?
One in five did not give the correct answer of eight .
The chairman of charity Every Child a Chance , which is running the campaign , John Griffiths - Jones , said adult innumeracy was one of the greatest scourges facing the country .
" The survey shows how essential it is that the business community gets involved in tackling the problem . "
The charity is working with the government to develop a programme helping primary - age children struggling with numeracy .
" Through the programme we aim to find a long - tem solution , spearheading resources of specially trained teachers to help the seven - year - olds who have the greatest difficulties with maths . "
The Department for Innovation , Universities and Skills is working on an adult numeracy strategy which is due to be launched later in the year .

Lake Zurich , IL gobluetwo Member Comcast gave us roaches !
As I sat down to watch the glory that is high definition , noticed that some of the numbers on the LED display of the box were n't coming out .
Weird , because I had n't noticed before .
Took a closer look and found this :
That , my friends , are pictures of TWO cockroaches in the display , one on each side .
In the 5 months we 've lived in our house , we have not seen a single roach .
Until I noticed these in the display .
Incidentally , I saw one trying to scurry away when I lifted up the box ( I caught it ) .
There were also some " droppings " underneath the box when I lifted it up .
I have it in my car sealed in a large trash bag right now and plan to return it to ( and get a new , hopefully roach - free , box from ) a different location .
Do you think I can expect any sort of compensation from Comcast for this ?
My evidence is these photos .
It may be a longshot , but this is just outrageous ( not to mention disgusting ) .
My wife called earlier and is angry because she caught one in the kitchen ( so some obviously left the nest and made it into the house ) .
Seriously !
I stopped by the local Comcast payment center ( Highland Park , IL - North Chicago Suburbs ) to swap out our standard digital set top box for a HD set top box .
Had some issues with the connection , but that was sorted out on Thursday afternoon .

Comcast is supposed to recondition every DCT that is recovered from a customer .
Unfortunately , the high volume of returned DCT 's combined with the huge demand for new installations means that most of these boxes are merely checked in , validated to be in working condition , and then sent out the door for new installs .
No fumigation takes place , you can bet .
In a word or two : Hell no !
For one thing , the photos are n't " evidence " in any true sense of that word .
Proving that the roaches came from the DCT , let alone from Comcast , will be impossible to prove .
Do n't misunderstand me , I do believe that the box was infested .
I do n't doubt your word that the first roach you spotted was right after you installed the box .
What can't be proven is from where the roaches originated .

there was an article somewhere last year about roaches in 50 comcast boxes at a service center .
They had to have the service center fumigated and they gave the customers free fumigation plus i think free cable for a year to drop the lawsuit .

Comcast is n't supposed to " recondition " every " box " that is recovered .. they simply process them .
Defective boxes go for repair , dirty boxes are wiped down and cleaned , and all boxes are cleared of previous customer data , re-masked ( computer codes ) and sent back out in the field .
No - fumigation never happens in the warehouse .
The box probably did have roaches in it .. it has happened , although very rare .
If it happens , you put the box in a garbage bag , tie it shut , and return in .
Comcast will take care of the customer .

Compensation ?
If you mean for anything other than actual cost to make you whole again ?
no ... taken care of ?
yes .
Roaches crawl into boxes because they are warm .
Comcast did n't give you the roaches .. they came from a customer , who POSSIBLY , did n't have a clean house .
I 've seen roaches come out of homes that were spotless too .
Do n't wait for comcast to act .
Call the exterminator out and take care of the problem .
Ask your exterminator to seek signs of roaches - if there were any in your home , they will take care of you .
I can pretty much bet they will pay the bill anyway .
BUT - do NOT wait for them to act agree to anything .. have it done yourself and seek reimbursement .
Good luck .

Get some Combat Roach Bait , and put it in the kitchen under the Sink cabinet , near the stove , and on small foil squares in the cupboards .
Problem with society , is that there are those that are filthy in normal neighborhoods , not just the hood .

So , in other words , nothing would change .

I 've seen this when I went to pick up a box at a Chinese restaurant .
So I had the customer drop it in the plastic bag and we trashed the box .
This was about 14yrs ago when boxes were a lot cheaper to throw away .
I would still do that today , because I would be pissed off if that a box like that came into my house .
The US Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) has launched an internal enquiry on its decision to remove toxicologist Deborah Rice from an internal review panel last summer , amid a congressional enquiry on the issue .
The House of Representative ’s Energy and Commerce Committee is investigating the situation , after learning that the American Chemistry Council ( ACC ) - a major chemical industry association - urged the agency to dismiss Rice on the grounds of bias .
The EPA panel was charged with examining reference doses for fire retardants known as polybrominated diphenyl ethers , or PBDEs , that may pose a public health risk .
Rice , a former EPA scientist now with the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention , was accused of bias because she made public statements against deca , which was one of the four forms of PBDEs the panel examined .
Rice made the remarks in February 2007 when she testified as an expert witness for the Maine state legislature .
EPA now wants its inspector general to determine whether Rice ’s dismissal was ’ consistent with existing federal law and regulations ’ , and whether the current rules governing EPA ’s scientific peer review panels are ’ adequate to protect objective scientific reviews ’ .
The agency also asks for recommendations on improving the system for recruiting and managing its expert panels , but sets no timeframe for a report .
Congressional investigation
EPA ’s request for assistance comes several weeks after the 27 March deadline by which it was asked to provide the House committee with extensive documentation on the Rice incident .
Among the records sought by the committee ’s chairman John Dingell , and Bart Stupak who chairs its oversight subcommittee , are all communications between EPA and others involving Rice , as well as all instances in which EPA has removed , or has considered removing , panel members for conflict of interest , lack of impartiality , or the appearance of lack of impartiality .
Congressmen Dingell and Stupak have also turned the spotlight on ACC , requesting that it hand over copious paperwork by 18 April .
The lawmakers want to know , for example , how the organisation determined that Rice had a conflict of interest that warranted her removal from the panel .
They are also interested in ’all records of payments and communications ’ between ACC and William Carroll , a former president of the American Chemical Society who also served as a spokesman for the Vinyl Institute - an industry trade group representing manufacturers .
The EPA is currently compiling its documents for the congressmen , and ACC has begun handing over many of the requested papers while preparing the rest .
At this point , Dingell and Stupak are satisfied that both subjects of investigation intend to cooperate .
’ Our investigation is ongoing , and as we receive the documents we will review them , ’ a committee spokesman said .
’ Our action depends on what the answers are and what we find . ’

What You Don't Know About Living in Space
As astronauts begin spacewalks , a few things of note about life in space .
March 14 , 2008  --
Early this morning astronauts completed the first of five planned spacewalks at the International Space Station .
They began assembling the Canadian - made robot arm and prepared to move the first piece of a Japanese - made space lab .
Ground controllers sent up a software patch for the robot hoping to fix a glitch that is so far preventing power from reaching the robot known as Dextre .
As the mission ended , astronauts were treated to a spectacular view of the Midwestern United States .
" Oh wow .
Wow .
Wow .
Wow .
It 's a pretty amazing view , " Endeavour astronaut Rick Linnehan said .
It 's all part of life in space , full of spectacular moments as well as the mundane .
Over the years , living in space has forced astronauts to make a few concessions to things you would not give a second thought about when staying at a Holiday Inn .
Here are a fews things you may not have known about living in space .
IPods :
For the last few years astronauts have been allowed to fly with iPods , a great space saver over CD players .
The iPods had to be modified to fly in space ; the lithium batteries were taken out and replaced with alkaline double
As that are certified to fly on the shuttle .
Though iPods can fly on the space shuttle , when the shuttle docks to the space station , iPods can't cross over the hatch because they have n't been certified to fly on the space station yet .
But now the people who figure out just where to stow everyone on the space shuttle have to find space for spare double - A batteries , because the iPods tend to be battery burners !
Silverware : Each space shuttle crew gets one set of silverware per mission .
They can't do dishes in space ( or laundry -- but that 's another story ) so they have to wipe their forks and knives down with disinfectant wipes after every meal .
Pizza : NASA can put a man on the moon but there is no way to get pizza on a space station or space shuttle mission .
It just does n't hold up .
You can't freeze - dry pizza or dehydrate it very successfully and regular pizza delivery is probably a few decades off from becoming reality .
Astronaut Mike Massimino , a native New Yorker , misses good pizza .
" It is hard to get good pizza in Texas .
It is impossible in space we do n't have it .
Someone would get a Nobel Prize if they can figure out how to get pizza in space . "
There is also no ice cream in space .
No freezer .
Padlocks :
On a previous mission many years ago a space shuttle commander was concerned about a crew member he considered potentially volatile .
He requested a padlock to lock the hatch to keep someone from opening it unexpectedly during a mission .
One shuttle commander , when offered the padlock option , declined , joking " My going - in assumption is that we can fly without padlocks , I will ask everyone how you feel prior to launch --? any suicidal tendencies or thoughts ? "
Laundry : Astronauts never worry about doing laundry -- there is simply no way to wash clothes in space ; water and resources are too scarce .
So for 12 days , or however long the mission runs , they wear the same clothes over and over .
Their T - shirts , socks and underwear have a special silver thread lining that absorbs odor and keeps items wearable longer .
NASA recycles the astronauts ' clothes for other missions , including the underwear .
Garbage :
The astronauts do n't just toss the garbage overboard .
The mandate is clean your plate and drink all the coffee in your drink bag because all the trash created on orbit has to fit in a container the size of a large kitchen garbage can .
That is seven astronauts ' times three meals times 12 or so days .
The trick is to wrap it up as small as you can when you are done eating and then compress it even more and tape it shut .
Money : Money has no value in space .
When seven astronauts are living together in a cramped atmosphere the psychology of small isolated groups kicks in .
Whoever has squirreled away the most M&Ms , tortillas or coffee has the most bargaining power .
Those are items that are most prized at the end of a mission if someone runs short in their own stash .
Astronauts ' meals are color coded on shuttle missions -- and reliable sources tell ABC News some astronauts are n't above switching the colored dots on their dehydrated meals if they have run out of say , lasagna , on day six and have way too much creamed spinach left .

The tour of Julia Anscomb 's once beautiful home on the Sussex coast began in the kitchen .
" This is where we found Bailey , " she explained .
Bailey is a lovable , shaggy - haired mongrel puppy and much loved family pet .
When Mrs Anscomb and her husband returned from a weekend away recently , Bailey was lying unconscious on the floor .

Wild : Gemma has yet to return home
He 'd been drugged .
The incriminating evidence was left at the scene : discarded ecstasy tablets .
" He did eventually wake up , but for days he was very quiet , hardly moved and would n't eat his food , " revealed a visibly distressed Mrs Anscomb yesterday .
Near the spot where the " comatose " canine was spreadeagled - and where Mrs Anscomb was now speaking - is a brand new luxury fridge .
At least it used to be .
Someone has vandalised it with a knife .
" It cost £ 600 and , as you can see , it is now covered in scratches , " said Mrs Anscomb .
" It 's ruined . "
As for what happened to the washing machine ( or , to be more accurate , on top of it ) , Mrs Anscomb , 37 , could barely bring herself to say ; she has been told it was where " group sex " had taken place .
All this . . . and the " tour " of Mrs Anscomb 's home had only just got under way .
The dog , the fridge , the washing machine , it 's just the start .
In the lounge , Mrs Anscomb 's once pristine cream carpet is still covered in stains .
" When we first got back , it was literally black , " she said .
" It was soaked through with alcohol , mud , cigarette ends and chewing gum .
The Anscombs ' dog Bailey was left ' comatose ' after chewing pills
" It took three of us , on our hands and knees with scrubbing brushes , about 24 hours to clean , and this is as good as it is going to get . "
An even worse scene awaited her in the dining room where the laminate flooring was four inches deep in beer .
" It will have to be replaced , " she said .
Upstairs , the walls are still covered in black marks , the carpet has now become " dull brown " , and the canopy above her eight - year - old daughter 's bed has been ripped off .
" We also found underwear between the sheets and a pair of handcuffs , " said Mrs Anscomb .
" What were they thinking ?
This is a little girl 's room . "
Nor , it seems , was such activity confined to her daughter 's bedroom ( or the washing machine ) .
Pointing to her own kingsize bed in the master bedroom , she declared : " There were six people in there having sex at one time .
We feel totally violated . "
Elsewhere in the Anscombs ' smart " newly decorated " semi in Worthing were traces of cocaine , marijuana - and enough empty vodka and rum bottles to fill a recycling plant .
The bill for the damage is still being counted .
It will run into " many thousands of pounds " .
Two laptops were also stolen , along with an iPod , expensive jewellery and a passport .
Oh yes , and 57 calls were made using the house phone .
How Mrs Anscomb , who works in advertising , now bitterly regrets taking her husband Robert - Gemma 's stepfather - to a West End show for his birthday and leaving her 15 - year - old daughter in charge of the house .
She thought Gemma could be trusted .
She thought she was a good girl .
" She gets all As and Bs at school ... she has never been a problem before . . . she has always been responsible ... "
Of course , hindsight is a wonderful thing .
But if Mrs Anscomb had taken a peek at Gemma 's page on the social networking site Bebo , perhaps she would not have needed hindsight .
Scroll down for more ...
Julia and Robert Anscomb's house had graffiti scrawled on the walls and totally wrecked rooms
It 's littered with expletives and references to " getting wrecked " .
Her home town , Gemma says , is the " biggest sh******. I ca n't wait to move " .
Describing her attitude to life , Gemma , who is posing seductively in several pictures , admits : " I do things I should n't do , I say things I should n't say .
" But at the end of the day there [ sic ] actions I choose to take , and they come with their own consequences .
But I 'd rather take them consequences , then [ sic ] never to take a chance . "
Consequences there certainly have been .
Gemma - and six " guests " - have now been questioned by police after her so - called evening in " to watch a video with a few friends " ( as she told her mum ) spiralled into a night of debauchery involving more than 50 young people .
Moreover , her relationship with her mother may have broken down irretrievably .
The two have not seen each other since " the morning after the night before " when Mrs Anscomb received a call from Gemma 's worried grandmother , who was looking after her younger sister , informing her : " You 'd better come back , Julia love . "
By then , Gemma was in " hiding " at a friend 's house .
Now she is staying with her father .
He and Mrs Anscomb split up seven years ago , but he still lives in Worthing , and sees Gemma regularly .
Now , however , she is refusing to go home to her mum .
Yobs caused thousands of pounds worth of damage to Robert and Julia Anscomb 's house
Poor girl , she 's too ashamed and embarrassed , is n't she ?
The boasts she put on her Bebo page before the party were just bravado .
Clearly , Gemma must be racked with guilt about what happened ?
Not if more recent internet postings are anything to by : " Yeahh it [ the party ] went wrong but it was well good .
. .
I mean it was f****** good . "
It 's a miracle Gemma even knew whether it was a " well good " party or not .
Friends say she passed out at 7.30 pm - after drinking to excess - and had to be carried to her bedroom where she remained " comatose " , like Bailey the dog , until the next morning .
When she did finally come round , she took the opportunity of mocking her own mother on her Bebo page , boasting : " My mother thought it would teach me a lesson by putting it in the papers .
. . all thats dne is make everyone go ' wow ur party made the front page ' . . . i meann it wasssss goooodddd .
. . and my mums a t*** nehowww . . . "
What a depressing - and disturbing - insight into the mindset of a not untypical teenage girl growing up in text - speaking , internet - obsessed , binge - drinking Britain .
Riotous events like Gemma's are increasingly common and have become known as " Skins parties " .
They take their name from the Channel Four drama Skins , about appallingly behaved adolescents .
The producers have even set up MySpace and Bebo pages for the characters , and web - only mini episodes have been screened .
Now - surprise , surprise - youngsters , like Gemma , and Rachel Bell , 17 , from Tyneside , are following suit in real life .
Rachel , you may recall , was the girl who placed an open invitation on MySpace last year for what she called a : " Let 's trash the average , family - sized house disco party . "
And they did .
More than 200 revellers from as far afield as London and Liverpool converged on her parents ' detached house in a respectable cul de sac in Houghton - le - Spring and destroyed it in seven hours of drink and drug - fuelled mayhem , causing £ 25,000 damage .
Hardly a week seems to go by without similar stories emerging .
Chippenham , Wiltshire ; the Pennine village of Facit , near Rochdale , Lancashire ; Croydon , South London - just a few of the other places where " Skins " parties have left a trail of destruction recently .
And all decent middle - class kids .
Now Alberta Road , Durrington , Worthing .
This is how the devastating events unfolded .
Mrs Anscomb and her husband , who , ironically runs a property maintenance company , had bought tickets for the musical Spamalot on the Friday afternoon of February 22 .
They booked a hotel for the night and planned to return on Saturday afternoon .
" I was n't worried about what might happen while we were away , " said Mrs Anscomb .
" I just thought Gemma and two or three of her friends would watch a few movies and maybe go to bed a bit late . "
In fact , Gemma 's " night in front of the TV " was already causing a buzz on Bebo , where she had posted her address .
One message from someone who was going to attend read : " 13 Hours !!!
And ill Be At Yours !!!!
Im Frigin Excited . "

Aftermath : A small amount of the alcohol drunk by the teenagers as they trashed the house
On the afternoon of the party , Gemma visited her immediate neighbours , a couple in their 60s , and gave them her mobile phone number .
She told them they should ring her if the noise got too loud .
Soon afterwards , at about the time her mother and step - father were taking their seats at London 's Palace Theatre , Gemma began drinking .
Witnesses say she downed wine and spirits .
It was half - term , and throughout the day more of Gemma 's friends arrived .
By 6 pm , things were already getting out of control .
Older youths had now heard about the party and started turning up at the front door .
To her credit , Gemma is said to have confronted one of them and demanded : " Who invited you ? "
But the boy replied : " It 's our party now . "
Gemma was not really in a fit state to stop him , and at around 7.30 pm she could no longer stand up and was taken upstairs .
Her big night was over .
The chain of events she had - unwittingly perhaps - set in motion was gathering momentum .
Some of the gatecrashers had brought drugs including cocaine , ecstasy and cannabis .
The music became louder ; the revellers rowdier .
They swarmed through the house , stubbing cigarettes out on carpets , spilling alcohol on the floor , and raiding the family drinks cabinet of champagne .
At 11 pm , the neighbours rang Gemma 's mobile - as instructed .
" There was no answer on the number Gemma gave us , " said Joyce Window , 66 .
" It was n't pleasant at all .
We thought it was just going to be a small party , but it soon became clear it was getting out of hand .
" More and more people turned up .
The music was so loud we could n't sleep .
We called the police . "
Officers confiscated cans of beer from a number of underage drinkers , but were assured by some of the older guests that responsible adults were present and that everyone would try to keep the noise down .
They left and the party continued .
In fact , according to two people who were inside the house , a scene resembling something from the " Court of Caligula " was unfolding in Julia Anscomb 's home .
" There were males just wandering around in their boxer shorts or completely naked , " said one young man who gatecrashed the party after finding out about it through word of mouth on the day .
" I saw a couple having sex on the washing machine and there were five or six girls and lads rolling around in the double bed upstairs .
It was like watching a porn movie .
" This was n't just teenagers .
There were people in their 20s as well .
Most of them did n't even know whose house it was .
I did n't stay long , but I was there long enough to see what was going on . "
Another gatecrasher , Sean O'Brien , a 25 - year - old plumber , found out about the party on the internet .
He arrived at 7 pm and stayed until 7am .
" I saw one man have sex with three women on the washing machine .
At about 2 am , I went into one of the bedrooms and saw two boys have sex .
Everything was going on . "
When asked if he took part , he replied : " We all got involved . "
Eventually , at around 4.30 am the party petered out , and Gemma awoke .
Remember that advertisement for Yellow Pages from the 1990s in which a brutally hung - over young man wakes up on the sofa to recall the wild party he threw the night before ?
All he had to do was let his fingers do the walking and call a French polisher to put the damage right before his parents ' return .
Gemma was not so fortunate .
She would have needed an army even to begin to tackle the destruction visited upon her home .
Gemma and a few friends did spend a couple of hours trying to repair the damage before giving up .
Panic - stricken , she called her grandmother at 8 am , who then contacted Mrs Anscomb .
" My mum told me that Gemma had held a wild party and the house was like a bomb site , " she said .
" We rushed back to Worthing , by which time Gemma had run away to her friend 's house .
" Nothing could have prepared us for what we found .
The whole house was wrecked from top to bottom .
" I was absolutely fuming .
I just could n't believe Gemma would do something like this .
She phoned me on the day after the party and said sorry , but I was so angry I put the phone down on her .
" What made me more angry was that she refused to come home and face the music and help with the clear - up . "
During the days that followed , Mrs Anscomb discovered ( from internet postings ) more of the unsavoury details of what took place .
" I feel like moving out , but I doubt I would be able to sell the house due to the reputation it has got .
I lie in bed at night thinking that people have been in here .
It 's disgusting .
" Gemma insists she is the victim because the party was invaded by gatecrashers .
I appreciate that she did n't intend for things to get out of hand , but the fact remains that she had a party behind my back and advertised it on the internet .
" She lied and now she has to face the consequences .
" I know she did n't intend to wreck the house , but I 'm angry as she ran away and did n't come home to face up to things .
She should have had more respect .
" I have done everything I can to bring her up properly .
But I must have gone wrong somewhere . "
For the moment , mother and daughter are living apart .
The have not spoken since Mrs Anscomb put the phone down on Gemma two weeks ago .
" She will have to work extremely hard to rebuild her bridges , but at the moment she has shown no remorse at all , " said Mrs Anscomb .
That , of course , is evident from Gemma 's Bebo page .
In her eyes , after all , the party was " well good " .
Flat - Faced Fish : First in Family ?
Share

Divers have discovered an unusual flat - faced fish with forward - looking eyes that may represent an entirely new piscine family .
If so , researchers say , it would be one of only a handful of new fish families found in the past 50 years .
First photographed in January off Ambon Island , Indonesia , the critter has crooked , leglike pectoral fins on its sides — typical of anglerfish , which crawl or walk along the seafloor .
Unlike others of its kind , however , which typically use lures on their heads to attract prey , this new flathead works its pliable body into crevices and cracks of coral reefs in search of food .
Researchers say that DNA testing is needed to determine whether this zebra-striped fish will inaugurate a 19th family of anglerfish , or whether it simply had an unfortunate run-in with the business end of a hammerhead shark .

Hannah Forrester had put up with endless testing and prodding while doctors tried to work out what was wrong with her .
Throughout , she 'd remained a happy and contented little girl .
But when she was told she had cancer and that the medicine would make her long brown hair fall out , she stopped talking and refused to eat or drink .
When her mother Cathy tried to hug her , the distraught child pushed her away .
Then into her room one day walked Molly , a five - year - old on the same ward .
Scroll down for more ...
Hannah Forrester , right , with Molly - the little girl who gave her a reason to fight her cancer
She , too , had cancer - a rare form called Wilms .
" She just walked into Hannah 's room and introduced herself , " recalls Cathy .
" She explained to Hannah : ' You need to take your medicine to make you better .
Your hair will fall out like mine , but it does n't matter .
' My mummy says it 'll grow back as long as Rapunzel's . '
" To my astonishment , Hannah listened .
Following Molly 's lead , she snapped out of her depression and began co-operating with the doctors and nurses .
" It was the start of an incredible friendship for the girls . "
Hannah had become ill in June 2006 , at the age of four .
The veins on her chest looked prominent , and she was unusually tired .
Her GP in Beckenham , Kent , put these symptoms down to an allergy , but the antihistamines he prescribed did n't work .
Over the next ten days , Hannah seemed increasingly tired .
When , later that week , Cathy took her and her brother Daniel , then eight , swimming , Hannah said she was too tired and climbed out of the pool .
" She loved swimming - this was totally out of character , " says Cathy .
She was also still worried about the prominent veins on her daughter 's chest .
" I just knew something was wrong , " she says .

Hannah with her parents Kathy and Barry and older brother Daniel
Fortunately , Cathy listened to her instincts and took her daughter to a specialist children 's A&E department in Lewisham , South London .
" The staff there were very concerned , " she recalls .
" They did blood tests and a chest X - ray , and kept her in overnight for more tests . "
Cathy 's husband Barry , 41 , rushed to the hospital .
Following a CT scan , the doctor took them to one side .
" She said Hannah needed to be transferred to London 's Great Ormond Street Hospital immediately .
She asked me to warn Hannah that she'd be in a ward where she would see lots of children with no hair .
" I know it sounds weird , but that 's how she explained it .
" I asked : ' Are you saying my child has cancer ? '
" She said : ' Yes , I 'm afraid so . ' "
The scan showed a large tumour was compressing Hannah 's main arteries , near her heart .
" At that stage , I was too shocked to absorb the information , " says Cathy .
" I just could n't believe she was ill . "
Cathy told Hannah she was very sick and needed to go to a special hospital where they could make her better .
" I made it sound like an adventure , and promised a party when she felt better .
She took it well ; she liked the idea of an ambulance ride . "
At Great Ormond Street , the illness was diagnosed as T - Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma .
Lymphoma is cancer of the lymphocytes - a type of white blood cell in the lymphatic system that helps the body fight disease .
Tumours can grow anywhere in the body .
There are more than 10,000 new cases in the UK each year , but only 60 to 70 are in children .
" The doctors said the cancer was so aggressive that if we had n't caught it when we did , Hannah would have died within two weeks , " says Cathy .
" I could n't understand how she could have this large tumour without us knowing .
She had all the symptoms - night sweats , dry cough , lethargy and loss of appetite - but they 'd only developed in the past couple of weeks . "
Doctors at Great Ormond Street decided to treat the cancer with six months of intensive chemotherapy , followed by less intensive chemotherapy over the next two years .
Hannah was given an 80 per cent chance of survival , but the chemo - therapy would weaken her immune system , exposing her to infections .
Treatment began immediately .
Cathy spent the next eight weeks staying in Hannah 's room at the hospital , while her husband Barry and son Daniel visited daily .
A device was fitted in Hannah 's chest through which drugs could be given intravenously , and blood could be taken for tests .
" I explained to Hannah that she needed special medicine that would make her hair fall out .
I tried to reassure her it would soon grow back , but she cried and said : ' I do n't want the medicine .
I do n't want to lose my hair !'
" If a doctor or nurse came in , she 'd scream and kick them .
She stopped talking to me and refused to eat or drink .
" It was heartbreaking to see my little girl , who was normally so happy and lively , like that . "
Hannah also had to have a feeding tube inserted through her nose and down her oesophagus , through which nutritious liquid food could be given when she felt too nauseous to eat .
" Although they managed to get the line down , she screamed about that , too , " says Cathy .
" Everything was a battle and took twice as long as it should have - it was horrible for us to have to watch .
I just wished I could take her place . "
Then , a week after Hannah was admitted , Molly Biederman , who 'd already lost her hair , skipped into her room and smiled .
She told Hannah she needed her medicine to get better , and not to worry about losing her hair because it would grow back .
She looked around the room at the Disney Princess cushions Hannah had been given for her fifth birthday and said : " I love princesses , too . "
" Hannah did n't say hello or smile , " says Cathy , " but she was listening .
Later , when it was time for her chemotherapy , for the first time she did n't fight . "
After that , Molly , who was in a room across the corridor , visited Hannah every day .
Molly 's mother Emma , who was pregnant with her second child , introduced herself to Cathy .
" Despite coping with her own daughter 's cancer , she was so chatty , positive and strong , " Cathy says .
" I felt in awe of her - just as Hannah was in awe of Molly .
She inspired me .
" Emma made me see that life goes on , even when your child has cancer .
That you can be upbeat and keep your sense of humour . "
Emma , now 31 , told Cathy that tumours had been found in Molly 's lungs and right kidney while the family were on holiday in Canada in 2005 , just before Molly turned four .
She was diagnosed with Wilms ' tumours - a kidney cancer found mainly in under - fives .
The cancer was very advanced and had already spread from Molly 's right kidney to her lungs .
Like Hannah , Molly was one of around only 70 children a year to be diagnosed with her type of cancer .
However , doctors were optimistic and rated her chances of beating it at 70 per cent .
Molly had had her right kidney removed , followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy to treat the lungs .
Happily , she had responded well .
Cathy says : " Molly was full of life and chatted to Hannah as if she had n't a care in the world .
I thought : ' What a lovely little girl . '
" She showed Hannah that she could still enjoy life , and that it was better to accept what was happening rather than fight .
The girls would play with Barbie dolls together , draw girly pictures of hearts and flowers , talk about Disney princesses and giggle over silly things .
" Gradually , I saw glimpses of the old Hannah returning .
After four weeks of treatment , she 'd chat to Molly about it , asking questions like : ' Does your head feel cold ?
When will your hair grow back ? '
" Then , to my immense relief , she began talking to me , too .
Molly helped Hannah to accept her illness in a way that no one else could . "
When Hannah 's hair began to fall out in clumps , Molly said : " Do n't worry , the hair fairy will take it and leave a present .
You 'll get to decorate a hair box to put it in . "
Cathy says : " Hannah got excited about the hair fairy .
The specialist play worker who helped all the children on the ward would help the children decorate a shoe box for their hair , and then the ' hair fairy ' would take the box and leave them a present , like the tooth fairy . "
Hannah and Cathy had to stay at the hospital for several weeks at a time , but Molly was on a different chemotherapy programme .
She would be in for a few days , then go home again .
Hannah really missed her whenever she was away , and become quiet and withdrawn .
The girls were soon best friends , and their mothers discovered they lived only a 15 - minute drive from each other .
" They 'd play together in the hospital playroom , or whizz up and down the corridor throwing footballs around .
Sometimes it seemed astonishing that they were ill . "
In the six months they knew each other , both girls seemed to go from strength to strength .
In September 2006 , Molly started school .
Three months later , in December , Hannah had more chemotherapy .
Even though she'd had the same drugs before , this time she responded badly .
" It knocked her right back , " says Cathy .
" Her stomach lining began bleeding ( a side - effect of the drugs ) and she became very lethargic and down .
It was heartbreaking to see her like this . "
Knowing how close the girls had become , Molly 's father Rob took his daughter to visit Hannah in hospital .
Molly gave her best friend an early Christmas present - a kit to decorate her own door plaque , jewellery box and photo frame .
Little did they know it then , but it was to be the last time the little girls would see each other .
" I remember Molly looked really well , " says Cathy .
" She ran around , sat on Hannah 's bed , chatted to her and cuddled her . "
Rob had good news , too : Molly 's latest scan had shown that her tumours had all been killed , and they were looking forward to a fresh start in the New Year .
On December 23 , Hannah was allowed home - but she did n't seem at all well .
" She did n't have the energy to get excited , " Cathy says .
" On Christmas Day , her head was burning and she looked very pale .
I helped her open her main present - a Barbie house .
" She 'd wanted it for months , but she did n't even smile . "
Knowing something was very wrong , Cathy immediately took her to Lewisham Hospital .
" Within minutes , four nurses and a doctor began working on her , while another doctor tried frantically to page colleagues .
I was terrified . "
Doctors believed Hannah was critically ill with blood poisoning .
They suspected the infection might have come from the tube that had been fitted into her chest to administer chemotherapy .
Her body was shutting down and they feared her heart was about to stop .
Hannah was rushed to intensive care , where staff struggled to stabilise her .
" I was ushered out of the room as they tried desperately to save her .
A nurse ran after me and said : ' Please come back and give your daughter a kiss . '
She was trying to tell me they feared that Hannah was dying .
" I looked at my little girl , attached to a drip and life support machine , with tubes everywhere , and I broke down and sobbed .
Barry was distraught , too .
" Daniel stood beside us , pale and shocked , asking if his sister would get better .
All we could say was that we had to hope and pray that she would . "
After three hours , staff managed to stabilise Hannah , though she remained critically ill .
" The doctors warned me they did n't know if they could save her , " says Cathy .
On December 29 , after four days in intensive care , she was transferred to Great Ormond Street , where she continued to deteriorate .
A nurse there told them that little Molly , too , was seriously ill .
Moments later , her mother Emma walked in .
" For the first time since I 'd known her , she was n't upbeat , " recalls Cathy .
" She was crying .
I hugged her as she explained a new tumour had grown on Molly 's lung in the two weeks since her last scan .
It was so aggressive , it could not be treated .
' Molly 's dying , ' she sobbed .
' She only has 48 hours . ' "
But even in the face of death , Molly showed great courage .
Emma says : " She knew she was dying .
She asked if we were proud of her , if she 'd been brave .
We told her what a heroine she was , and how we were bursting with pride . "
That night , a nurse explained how dying children often hang on to life longer than they ought to , not wanting to leave their parents to grieve .
So Emma told her brave little girl it was time to stop fighting .
" I said there were lots of people waiting to meet her in Heaven .
She opened her eyes and looked at me .
It was a look of acceptance .
Then she went back to sleep . "
Just a few paces away , Cathy willed Hannah to cling to life .
" I prayed she 'd pull through , and pleaded with her to keep fighting .
" My only consolation , if there can be any in that situation , was thinking : ' At least if both girls go , they 'll go together . ' "
At 2.55 am , Hannah woke up screaming .
" I hugged her , but she was inconsolable , " says Cathy .
" She could n't tell me why she was crying .
I cuddled and stroked her , and she went back to sleep . "
By the next morning , Hannah was out of danger .
But when Cathy saw Emma and Rob , they broke the news that Molly had died .
" We hugged and cried .
I asked Emma what time Molly had passed away and she said 2.55 am - the exact time Hannah had woken up screaming . "
Cathy waited five days until Hannah was stronger before telling her about Molly .
" She was distraught .
She sobbed and wailed : ' But she never got to see her hair grow back . '
I told her the angels had taken Molly to Heaven - that she was happy and healthy there .
" But it was so hard for her to accept .
She asked if she could go and see her there , or if the angels could bring Molly back to visit .
It was heart - rending . "
In an attempt to help Hannah accept Molly 's death , Cathy encouraged Hannah to talk about Molly whenever she wanted .
" At Hannah 's sixth birthday party on July 1 , 2007 , she was so upset that Molly could n't come .
She set off a pink balloon for her , with a secret note attached to the end .
As it floated away , she yelled : ' Molly , here 's a balloon for you . ' "
Hannah is now nearing the end of her treatment for cancer .
She 's still in remission and doing well at school .
" She 's made lots of friends but still talks about Molly a lot .
She 'll never forget her - none of us will , " says Cathy .
Emma is now seven months pregnant with her third child .
" I still miss Molly terribly , and no one can ever replace her , but I do n't feel bitter , " she says .
" For some reason , Molly was n't meant to live long .
Rob and I feel extremely lucky to have had her with us as long as we did . "
Cathy says the two families still talk regularly .
" When you go through something like this together , you create a bond that can not be broken . "
Emma and Rob have set up a fund to raise money for research in memory of Molly .
Emma is also training in childcare so she can work as a play specialist at Great Ormond Street .
She says : " The hospital did so much for our children .
This is our way of giving something back , and keeping Molly 's memory alive . "
The bounceback e-mail messages come in at a trickle , maybe one or two every hour .
The subject lines are disquieting : " Cyails , Vygara nad Levytar , " " UNSOLICITED BULK EMAIL , apparently from you . "
You eye your computer screen ; you 're nervous .
What 's going on ?
Have you been hacked ?
Are you some kind of zombie botnet spammer ?
Nope , you 're just getting a little backscatter -- bounceback messages from legitimate e-mail servers that have been fooled by the spammers .
Spammers like to put fake information in their e-mail messages in order to sneak them past e-mail filters .
Because e-mail filters now just delete messages that come from nonexistent domains , the spammers like to make their messages look like they come from real e-mail addresses .
That means , if your e-mail address has been published on the Web somewhere , you 're a prime candidate for backscattering .
The spammer finds your address , or sometimes even guesses it , and then puts it in the " from " line of his messages , sending them out to hundreds of thousands of recipients .
When the spam gets sent to an address that is no longer active , it can sometimes be bounced back ... to you .
Although Sophos estimates that backscatter makes up just two percent or three percent of all spam , antispam vendors say these messages are on the rise lately .
Users often think that the backscatter may be a sign that their computer has been hacked and is sending out spam messages , said Brad Bartman , a global support manager with Text 100 , a public relations consultancy .
" They look at it and they 're like , ' Whoa , is my PC infected with a virus ? ' " he said .
Backscatter rarely hits more than one or two employees at the same time , so it is n't particularly disruptive .
But it does worry users , he said .
" It 's mostly a psychological thing . "
With their e-mail addresses widely circulated on press releases , Text 100's PR specialists are the ideal candidates for backscatter .
Because backscatter comes from legitimate mail servers , it can cause special problems .
In fact , some security researchers believe that the spammers have been intentionally sending messages that will be bounced back as a way to sneak around spam filters .
That 's because some mail servers bounce back the original message as part of their notice .
Dan Wallach , like Text 100's Bartman , was hit with a flood of backscatter messages earlier this week .
Wallach , an associate professor with Rice University 's Department of Computer Science , said that many of the messages he received contained links to suspicious executable files hosted on different Web sites .
" I 'll bet that some spammer is rationally thinking ' error messages !
Maybe I can get my message through via error messages ! ' "
Wallach said in an e-mail interview .
" They do n't need many responses before this sort of tactic could be considered to be a success . "
At its worst the phenomenon can even wipe Internet servers off the map .
Last month , Stephen Gielda , president of Packetderm , upset a fraudster who was trying to use his anonymous Internet service .
Soon his servers were inundated with a tidal wave of backscatter messages .
At one point , he was being hit by 10,000 bounceback messages per second , enough to throttle the server 's Internet connection .
Gielda had to take his site off - line for five days as he waited for the problem to abate .
" I 'm used to backscatter , but I 'd never seen it at this level before , " he said .
While backscatter is extremely hard to filter out , it is a problem that can be fixed .
Backscatter comes in three varieties : messages from mail servers , saying that there is no such user available ; " out of office " automated reply messages ; and so - called challenge - response messages , which tell the sender that his message will be delivered only once he responds to the bounceback and confirms that the e-mail is coming from a legitimate address .
Security experts say that people should simply stop using these last two types of bounceback messages .
As for " no such user " bouncebacks , that can be fixed too .
There are a few e-mail standards that could help with the problem : Variable Envelope Return Path ( VERP ) and Bounce Address Tag Validation ( BATV ) , for example .
But the problem would largely disappear if server administrators configured their mail servers to immediately reject mail that is sent to nonexistent users , rather than accepting it and then bouncing it back to the faked addresses .
Some ISPs ( Internet service providers ) , AOL for example , have done this and have largely eliminated their role in the problem .
If there is spam in the backscatter message , antispam software should filter it out , but if a message has an ambiguous subject line , like " Hey " and the spam message stripped out , the backscatter will look like a legitimate bounceback and is probably going to get through , said Dmitry Samosseiko , manager of Sophos Labs Canada .
" This is a serious problem that is hard to deal with , to be honest , " he said .
" We can blame spammers for causing the issue in the first place , but it exists because of the mail servers that are not configured to deal with spam . "
Protesters clash with police over New Orleans demolitions David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday December 20 , 2007

Print This Email This Violence broke out in New Orleans on Thursday after police shut the gates of City Hall against protesters who were attempting to enter a City Council meeting that was expected to approve the demolition of 4500 units of public housing .
When about 100 protesters broke through , police began using pepper spray and tasers and even engaging in fistfights with the demonstrators .
MSNBC spoke to Judith Brown - Dianis of the Advancement Project , an organizer of the demonstration , who explained that the City Council normally allows people to stand in the aisles and at the back but had arbitrarily set a strict limit on the seating capacity in order to exclude the protesters .
She said the violence could have been avoided if the police had just let people in .
" What 's behind this is a new vision for the city , " Brown - Dianis told MSNBC .
" That means fewer poor people in the city .
There 's a lot of money going into this . "
The Department of Housing and Urban Development says it wants to demolish the housing projects so that developers can create mixed - income neighborhoods .
However , opponents of the plan charge that it represents a deliberate attempt to rid the city of its poorest and blackest residents , whose housing options were already greatly reduced by Hurricane Katrina .
" Instead of building more housing , the government is going to limit the number of poor folks who can return to the city , " Brown - Dianis stated .
" These [ existing ] buildings are not dangerous ...
They are structurally fine .
... HUD has a different plan , they 're going to build wood - frame homes that will not sustain a Category 3 hurricane . "
The dispute over the demolitions has intensified racial and political divisions in the city , with white members of the City Council and Republicans generally supporting it and blacks and Democrats opposing it .
Even national figures , like presidential candidates Barack Obama and John Edwards , have added their voices to those who would like to see the demotions stopped .
This video is from MSNBC's News Live , broadcast on December 20 , 2007 .
They had stomach cramps , nausea , anemia and fatigue , and some even had a telltale bluish line along their gums  classic signs of lead poisoning .
But the cases , last year in Leipzig , Germany , puzzled doctors .
Lead poisoning is rare in Germany , and yet here were 29 cases in just a few months .
The doctors noticed a pattern : the patients were young , from 16 to 33 ; they were students or unemployed ; and they had body piercings and a history of smoking .
In a letter published Thursday in The New England Journal of Medicine , the doctors wrote , “ On questioning , all the patients eventually conceded that they were regular users of marijuana . ”
Three provided samples for testing .
Sure enough , their marijuana was full of lead .
One bag bought from a dealer even contained lead particles big enough to see , which meant the lead must have been added deliberately , rather than being absorbed into the plant from contaminated soil .
The core temperature of a joint can reach nearly 2,200 degrees Fahrenheit , the doctors noted  more than hot enough to melt lead , which can be absorbed through the respiratory tract .
MIAMI ( Reuters ) - The Air Force lawyer who quit as chief prosecutor for the Guantanamo war court five months ago because of what he called political interference has asked to leave the U.S. military , he said on Tuesday .

Col .
Moe Davis said he submitted retirement papers last week , partly because of fallout from his public criticism of the Guantanamo court and partly because of family concerns .
He does not expect the military to oppose his retirement .
“ I imagine my last day in uniform will be some time in July , ” Davis , a 25 - year veteran who has worked as both a U.S. military prosecutor and defense lawyer , told Reuters in a telephone interview from the Washington area .
As chief prosecutor in the Guantanamo legal system for two years , Davis was a fierce advocate for the court created by the Bush administration to try suspected terrorists outside of regular U.S. military and civilian courts .
He resigned in October , alleging Pentagon officials had exerted political influence in an effort to rush through high - profile charges and approved the use of torture - tainted evidence .
Davis suddenly became a hero to the human rights groups that had long excoriated him .
He also became a potential defense witness for prisoners he had charged as prosecutor .
“ A year ago I was a villain of the left , just a puppet of the Bush administration , a neo -Nazi jerk .
Now the people that hated me think I ’m a hero .
To the people that loved me then , I ’m a villain overnight , ” Davis told Reuters .
Davis , who once compared Guantanamo defendants to vampires cringing from the sunlight of justice , summed up his new status with one of the colorful metaphors that were his hallmark .
“ I ’ve always thought of myself as middle of the road .
In the middle of the road , you get hit by traffic in both directions , ” said Davis , who is now director of the Air Force Judiciary in Washington .
TESTIFYING FOR DEFENSE
Davis , 49 , has agreed to testify for the defense in the pending trial at Guantanamo of one of Osama bin Laden ’s bodyguards , Salim Ahmed Hamdan , whose case he himself prepared .
He has also been cited in Guantanamo court papers and by defense attorneys as saying he was pressured to file “ sexy ” cases and to rush through charges while the rules were still being written for the revised system Congress approved in 2006 , after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down an earlier version of the war tribunals .
The military has since prevented him from testifying before Congress about the Guantanamo war court , and Davis said he expected an effort to stop him from testifying as a defense witness .
The Pentagon has said it plans to try as many as 80 of the 280 Guantanamo detainees .
But more than six years after the United States began sending foreign captives to the U.S. naval base in Cuba , only 14 have been charged in the revised court system .
Thirteen of those cases are still pending , including those against six prisoners who could be executed if convicted of charges of involvement in the September 11 attacks .
Davis said he is still convinced that those he charged are in fact guilty .
But he said they deserve fair trials that could only occur if the military is allowed to run the Guantanamo court without political influence , if there is a commitment not to use evidence obtained by the harsh interrogation technique known as waterboarding , which simulates drowning , or “ undue coercion , ” and if the trials are held openly without relying on secret evidence .
“ You can have the most perfect trials in the history of the world but behind closed doors , in secret , nobody ’s going to believe it was fair , ” he said .

WASHINGTON 
The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has written an unusual open letter to all those in uniform , warning them to stay out of politics as the nation approaches a presidential election in which the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan will be a central , and certainly divisive , issue .
“ The U.S. military must remain apolitical at all times and in all ways , ” wrote the chairman , Adm .
Mike Mullen , the nation ’s highest - ranking officer .
“ It is and must always be a neutral instrument of the state , no matter which party holds sway . ”
Admiral Mullen ’s essay appears in the coming issue of Joint Force Quarterly , an official military journal that is distributed widely among the officer corps .
The essay is the first Admiral Mullen has written for the journal as chairman of the Joint Chiefs , and veteran officers said they could not remember when a similar “ all - hands ” letter had been issued to remind military personnel to remain outside , if not above , contentious political debate .
Euro 2008 kicks off in 2 weeks with Switzerland taking on the Czech Republic at St Jakob Park on Saturday 7 June 2008 .
It promises to be a cracking event , not only for the football on display but for the picturesque backdrop it will be played in .
Let ’s take a look at the 8 stadiums that will be hosting the event :
1. St Jakob Park , Basel
The biggest arena in Switzerland , St Jakob Park was built in 1998 to replace the St Jakob Stadium , which hosted the 1954 World Cup Final between West Germany and Hungary .
In 2006 , the ground witnessed one of the worst cases of hooliganism in Swiss history when FC Basel and FC Zurich fans fought on the pitch after a championship decider .
The capacity of the stadium has been increased from 38,500 to 42,500 for these finals , and it will host a total of six matches , including the first match between Switzerland and the Czech Republic , as well as the opening ceremony .
Euro 2008 matches :
07 June 18:00 Group A Switzerland — Czech Republic
11 June 20:45 Group A Switzerland — Turkey
15 June 20:45 Group A Switzerland — Portugal
19 June 20:45 Quarterfinal 1 Winners Group A — Runners - up Group B
21 June 20:45 Quarterfinal 3 Winners Group C — Runners - up Group D
25 June 20:45 Semifinal 1 Winners Quarterfinal 1 — Winners Quarterfinal 2
2. Stade de Suisse Wankdorf Stadium , Berne
The home ground of Young Boys Bern has a single red seat which was the first installed in the ground .
It is not possible to buy tickets for the seat — it is instead occupied by a notable personality each game .
Wankdorf is a relatively new stadium , having been built in 2004 .
It opened in January 2005 with a friendly between Young Boys and Olympique Marseille and has a capacity of 32,000 .
Euro 2008 matches :
09 June 20:45 Group C Netherlands —
Italy
13 June 20:45 Group C Netherlands — France
17 June 20:45 Group C Netherlands — Romania
3. Stade De Genève , Geneva
With Geneva the home of FIFA , it is not surprising that the Stade De Genève was selected as one of the host venues .
With a capacity of just 30,084 , it will be the smallest stadium used at the finals this summer , although it boasts some pretty spectacular views .
The Stade De Genève is the home of the fallen giants of Swiss football , Servette , who were declared bankrupt in 2005 and have only just been promoted back to the Swiss equivalent of the Championship .
English fans will remember the stadium as it hosted the friendly match between England and Argentina in December 2005 .
Euro 2008 matches :
07 June 20:45 Group A Portugal — Turkey
11 June 18:00 Group A Czech Republic — Portugal
15 June 20:45 Group A Turkey — Czech Republic
4. Letzigrund Stadion , Zurich
The stadium has been the home of FC Zurich since 1925 , but it is also the current home of the more famous Grasshoppers , who are using the venue while they have a new stadium built .
It also doubles up as Switzerland ’s premier athletics stadium , hosting the annual Weltklasse athletics meeting , which is part of the International Amateur Athletics Federation ’s annual roster of events .
In 2000 , Tina Turner sold out the stadium on two nights during her Twenty Four Seven Tour .
Euro 2008 matches :
09 June 18:00 Group C Romania — France
13 June 18:00 Group C Italy — Romania
17 June 20:45 Group C France — Italy
5. Ernst - Happel - Stadion , Vienna
The biggest stadium being used in Euro 2008 with 53,000 seats and the venue for the final .
The Ernst Happel is the national stadium of Austria .
It is not home to any Austrian clubs , although it does regularly host bigger home matches for Rapid Vienna and Austria Vienna , whose own grounds are smaller .
It has hosted four European Cup finals , as well as Manchester City ’s sole European success – their 2 - 1 win against Gornik Zabrze in the 1970 European Cup Winners Cup Final .
The stadium will host all three of Austria ’s group matches , two quarterfinals , one semifinal and the final .
Euro 2008 matches :
08 June 18:00 Group B Austria — Croatia
12 June 20:45 Group B Austria — Poland
16 June 20:45 Group B Austria — Germany
20 June 20:45 Quarterfinal 2 Winners B — Runners -up A
22 June 20:45 Quarterfinal 4 Winners D — Runners -up C
26 June 20:45 Semifinal 2 Winners Quarterfinal 3 — Winners Quarterfinal 4
29 June 20 :45 Final Winners Semifinal 1 — Winners Semifinal 2
6. Wörthersee Stadion , Klagenfurt
One of the stranger venue choices as it is a town with a population of just 90,000 .
Germany will play two of their games in the town and there are question marks about whether the infrastructure can cope .
The town ’s football club , SK Austria KÃ¤rnten , was founded in 2007 after taking over the franchise of ASKÃ– Pasching , who had been one of the less distinguished members of the Austrian Bundesliga .
Hypo -Arena has a capacity of 32,000 , though this is to be reduced to 12,500 after the tournament has finished .
Euro 2008 matches :
08 June 20:45 Group B Germany — Poland
12 June 18:00 Group B Croatia — Germany
16 June 20:45 Group B Poland — Croatia
7. Stadion Salzburg Wals - Siezenheim , Salzburg
Salzburg is famous for being the birthplace of Mozart and the setting for much of “ The Sound Of Music ” but it made headlines in 2005 for footballing reasons .
Soft drinks company Red Bull purchased Casino Salzburg , changing the club ’s name and landing itself in hot water for trying to claim that “ this is a new club with no history ” .
The old Casino club had won three Austrian Bundesligas and contested the 1994 UEFA Cup final , which they lost to Internazionale .
The Stadion Wals - Siezenheim has been expanded from 18,000 to 31,000 for the finals .
It has a plastic pitch , although it will be replaced with grass for the duration of the tournament .
Euro 2008 matches :
10 June 20:45 Group D Greece — Sweden
14 June 20:45 Group D Greece — Russia
18 June 20:45 Group D Greece — Spain
8. Stadion Tivoli Neu , Innsbruck
Yet another new stadium that has been expanded for the tournament , it is something of an anomaly because Austria , despite their poor recent form , have actually won a game at the ground , beating the Ivory Coast 3 - 2 there in October 2007 .
The stadium is home to FC Wacker Triol , another new club , founded after the bankruptcy of one of Austrian football ’s better known names , FC Tirol Innsbruck , which collapsed in 2002 .
Euro 2008 matches :
10 June 18:00 Group D Spain — Russia
14 June 18:00 Group D Sweden — Spain
18 June 20:45 Group D Russia — Sweden

A New Horizon for Phoenix
Credit : Phoenix Mission Team , NASA , JPL - Caltech , Univ. Arizona
Explanation :
This flat horizon stretches across the red planet as seen by the Phoenix spacecraft after yesterday 's landing on Mars .
Touching down shortly after 7:30 pm Eastern Time , Phoenix made the first successful soft landing on Mars , using rockets to control its final speed , since the Viking landers in 1976 .
Launched in August of 2007 , Phoenix has now made the northernmost landing and is intended to explore the Martian arctic 's potentially ice - rich soil .
The lander has returned images and data initially indicating that it is in excellent shape after a nearly flawless descent .
News updates will be available throughout the day .
Crime rates are falling rapidly , with the number of offences recorded by the police dropping by 12 per cent in a year .
The continuing decline – which includes a 19 per cent decrease in car crime and a 21 per cent fall in robbery – means the risk of being a victim of crime is at its lowest since the early 1980s .
There was , however , an increase in gun crime , with 9,967 offences recorded by the police in 2007 , a 4 per cent rise on the previous year .
Drug offences also rose , by 20 per cent , although the Home Office said that reflected recent guidance to police officers formally to caution people caught with cannabis .

The statistics were published yesterday as both ministers and the Opposition supported plans to give local communities more information about crime rates in their neighbourhoods .
Jacqui Smith , the Home Secretary , is urging police forces to disclose the information for each council ward .
She believes it will help officers draw up crime - fighting priorities better to reflect the problems in each area .
David Cameron , the Conservative leader , went further yesterday and called for details of crime to be published on a street - by - street basis , a move which would inevitably have an impact on house prices .
He said : " Crime really does spread like a disease – it is infectious and clusters around certain areas .
By pinpointing exactly on a map where it 's happening , the police can take appropriate action . "
The steady overall fall in crime , which has continued for several years , was underlined by two sets of figures published yesterday : the numbers of offences recorded by the police in England and Wales between October and December 2007 ; and the Brit-ish Crime Survey ( BCS ) , based on interviews with the public , for 2007 .
The recorded crime statistics showed 1,208,600 offences were reported to police in the last three months of 2007 , a fall of 12 per cent on the 1,369,200 recorded in the same period in 2006 .
Overall , violent crime was down by 10 per cent , with an even sharper fall of 15 per cent in the number of the most serious offences .
Sex offences fell by 8 per cent , domestic burglary by 5 per cent , car crime by 19 per cent and criminal damage by 17 per cent .
The BCS confirmed the trend , calculating that 10.4 million crimes were committed last year , a 6 per cent fall on 2006 .
Its figures attempt to calculate the actual number of offences rather than just those reported to the police .
Car crime fell by 10 per cent , vandalism by 8 per cent , violent crime by 6 per cent and robbery by 2 per cent .
Domestic burglary was the exception , with raids on homes going up by 5 per cent .
Separate figures showed the number of firearms offences recorded by police rose by 4 per cent last year .
But the number of deaths fell from 56 to 49 and the number of serious injuries fell from 424 to 355 .

Ms Smith said : " These are excellent statistics .
I am particularly pleased to see sizeable reductions in recorded violent crime and robbery . "
But opposition parties registered alarm over the levels of gun crime and drugs offences .
Chris Huhne , the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokes - man , said : " Ministers must get tough on guns .
" We need more intelligence - led stop and search and greater police effort to win the trust of blighted communities , as that is the most effective way of pinpointing problems . "
David Davis , the shadow Home Secretary , said : " Violent crime has doubled under this Government .
The latest figures show that drug and gun crime continue to rise unabated .
" The rising tide of violence on our streets is the consequence of Labour 's lax approach to law enforcement , and failure to address the causes of crime . "
Crime in numbers
Criminal damage - 17 %
Robbery - 21 %
Drugs offences + 20 %
Home burglary - 5 %
Offences causing injury - 11 %
Serious violence - 15 %
Vehicle crime - 19 %
Sexual offences - 8 %
Overall crime - 12 %

People in low - lying poor nations , such as Bangladesh , are at most risk Sea levels could rise by up to one - and - a - half metres by the end of this century , according to a new scientific analysis .
This is substantially more than the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) forecast in last year 's landmark assessment of climate science .
Sea level rise of this magnitude would have major impacts on low - lying countries such as Bangladesh .
The findings were presented at a major science conference in Vienna .
The research group is not the first to suggest that the IPCC 's forecast of an average rise in global sea levels of 28 - 43 cm by 2100 is too conservative .
The IPCC was unable to include the contribution from " accelerated " melting of polar ice sheets as water temperatures warm because the processes involved were not yet understood .
Melt water
The new analysis comes from a UK / Finnish team which has built a computer model linking temperatures to sea levels for the last two millennia .
Glaciers ' flowing faster '
" For the past 2,000 years , the [ global average ] sea level was very stable , it only varied by about 20 cm , " said Svetlana Jevrejeva from the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory ( POL ) , near Liverpool , UK .
" But by the end of the century , we predict it will rise by between 0.8 m and 1.5 m .
" The rapid rise in the coming years is associated with the rapid melting of ice sheets . "
The model , she told reporters here at the European Geosciences Union ( EGU ) annual meeting , is able to mimic accurately sea levels reliably observed by tide gauges over the last 300 years .
There is little concrete evidence on sea levels for the thousands of years before that , explained POL's Simon Holgate , who was not involved in the new study .
" There is some limited archaeological evidence [ based on ] the sill heights of fish enclosures that the Romans used , that 's probably the strongest evidence that there has n't been any significant change in sea level over the last 2,000 years . "
Against that , he said , the currently observed rise of about three mm per year is significant , and many scientists working in the field expect to see an acceleration .
Last year , German researcher Stefan Rahmstorf used different methodology but reached a similar conclusion to Dr Jevrejeva 's group , projecting a sea level rise of between 0.5 m and 1.4 m by 2100 .
Space - eye view
The latest satellite data indicates that the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets are losing mass , though the much bigger East Antarctic sheet may be gaining mass .
Ebb and flow of sea level rise A full melting of Greenland and West Antarctica would raise sea levels by many metres ; but the process , if it happened , would take centuries .
" We know what 's happening today from satellite data , but trying to predict what that means in the future is very difficult science , " noted Steve Nerem from the University of Colorado , whose own research concerns global sea levels .
" There 's a lot of evidence out there that we 're going to see at least a metre of sea level rise by 2100 , " he said .
" We 're seeing big changes in Greenland , we 're seeing big changes in West Antarctica , so we 're expecting this to show up in the sea level data as an increase in the rate we 've been observing . "
However , a rise of even a metre could have major implications for low - lying countries - especially , noted Dr Holgate , those whose economies are not geared up to build sophisticated sea defence systems .
" Eighty to 90 % of Bangladesh is within a metre or so of sea level , " he said , " so if you live in the Ganges delta you 're in a lot of trouble ; and that 's an awful lot of people . "
Dr Jevrejeva 's projections have been submitted for publication in the scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .

What are these ?
Superconductors can convey more than 150 times more electricity than copper wires because they do n’t restrict electron movement , the essence of electricity .
But to do this , the materials have to be cooled below a very low , so - called , transition temperature , which often makes them impractical for widespread use .
Now for the first time , scientists have found that in addition to chemical manipulation , the superconducting state can be induced by high pressure in so - called high - temperature superconductors .
The discovery , published in the May 30 , 2008 , issue of Physical Review Letters , opens a new window on understanding and harnessing these miracle materials .
The early superconductors had to be cooled to extremely low ( below 20 K or - 423° F ) temperatures .
But in the 1980s scientists discovered a class of what they call high - temperature superconductors made of ceramic copper oxides , called cuprates .
They found that at temperatures as high as about 135 K , or - 216 º F , these materials transition into superconductors .
Understanding how they work and thus how they can be manipulated to operate at even higher temperatures is currently one of the most important unsolved problems in physics — a holy grail for many .
“ In cuprate superconductors the atoms are arranged in a layered structure , ” explained co-author of the study , Viktor Struzhkin at the Carnegie Institution ’s Geophysical Laboratory .
“ When the material goes into the superconducting state , changes occur in the copper - oxide planes , the electron spins behave differently , the vibrational energy is altered , the charges move differently , and more . ”
Another co-author of the study , Alexander Goncharov , elaborated : “ Over the years scientists have found that the transition temperature can be increased with a specific amount of ‘ doping , ’ which is the addition of charged particles — either negatively charged electrons or positively charged holes .
We wanted to see the effects of high pressure on one bismuth - based high - temperature cuprate ( Bi1.98.Sr2.06Y0.68Cu2O8+δ ) .
Pressure has the added bonus that it can be applied gradually , like tuning a radio .
We gradually tuned in to the superconductivity and could watch what happened over a broad range of pressures . ”
The scientists observed the subatomic effects on the material of pressures close to 350,000 times the atmospheric pressure at sea level ( 35 GPa ) using a diamond anvil cell to squeeze the sample and specialized techniques , Raman spectroscopy and X - ray diffraction , to measure the changes .
“ 21 GPa was the magic number , or critical pressure , ” remarked Tanja Cuk , the lead author and a student at Stanford University , who carried out this work as part of her Ph.D. thesis research .
“ By compressing the structure , we were able to observe changes in six different physical properties .
But even more exciting , the changes were similar to those observed when the material has been doped to its optimal level .
This means that the critical pressure is likely related to doping .
Plus , by finding that pressure can be used instead of temperature and doping , we ’ve found an entirely new approach to studying what ’s behind superconducting properties of high - Tc superconductors . ”
According to Struzhkin : “ This study brings us one step closer to understanding the mechanism of high - temperature superconductivity by giving a completely new perspective of the superconducting state driven by a continuous variable — pressure .
It appears that superconductivity is favored on the borderline between insulating and metallic states .
By applying these high pressures , we may be able to discover the missing clues to the mechanism of the high - temperature superconductivity and move a few steps closer to using superconductors in daily life .
This could change our whole energy system . ”

ACLU Demands That Company Make All Tax Preparation Services Available To Gay Couples
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : media@aclu.org
HARTFORD , CT – The American Civil Liberties Union sent a demand letter to H&R Block today demanding that it change its online tax preparation system to accommodate gay couples in Connecticut with civil unions .
The ACLU is representing a couple with a civil union who attempted to file their taxes on the company ’s website through their online service , TaxCut Online , but were told , “ We do n’t support Connecticut civil union returns . ”
Through its website , the company said the couple would have to work with one of their professionals , by phone or at one of their office locations , which would be more time consuming and substantially more expensive .
( A PDF with screen captures of the messages is available at
/lgbt/relationships/34632res20080325.html )
“ This is yet another example of the many ways that civil unions just do n’t live up to marriage , ” said Jason Smith of Hartford , who has been with his partner Settimio Pisu for six years .
“ It really stung when I realized it would cost an additional $ 150 dollars to have our tax returns prepared .
We ’re saving for a house and hoping to start a family , so every penny counts right now . ”
According to the letter the ACLU sent to H&R Block , failing to provide gay couples with civil unions the option of filing their taxes online as it does for married couples is in violation of a state law that bars discrimination based on sexual orientation and civil union status .
The letter demands that the company adapt its website to accommodate couples with civil unions and to reimburse all couples who were forced to pay the additional charges due to H&R Block ’s discriminatory practices .
“ The civil union law has been in effect for nearly three years now , yet companies still are n’t taking it seriously , ” said Andrew Schneider of the ACLU of Connecticut .
“ There is no excusable reason why the company that likes to claim it ’s the world ’s largest tax services provider should n’t make its products available to everyone . ”
Although the tax requirements for couples with civil unions in Connecticut are very similar to the requirements for married gay couples in Massachusetts , H&R Block ’s online tax preparation service seems to accommodate married gay couples there .
“ Indignities like these are a constant reminder there is no substitution for marriage , ” said Rebecca Shore , an attorney with the ACLU ’s Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Project .
“ Nothing can replace the dignity and universal recognition that comes automatically when you get to say we ’re married .
In Connecticut , gay couples still ca n’t do that . ”
A copy of the demand letter and the screen captures from H&R Block ’s website indicating their refusal to process civil union returns is available at :

HONG KONG ( Reuters ) - A Chinese primary school teacher and a beautician have filed a suit against CNN in New York over remarks they say insulted the Chinese people and are seeking $ 1.3 billion in compensation -- $ 1 per person in China , a Hong Kong newspaper reported .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
The case against the Atlanta - based cable channel , its parent company Turner Broadcasting and Jack Cafferty , the offending commentator , comes after 14 lawyers launched a similar suit in Beijing alleging that Cafferty ’s remarks earlier this month violated the dignity and reputation of the Chinese people .
Cafferty said the United States imported Chinese - made “ junk with the lead paint on them and the poisoned pet food ” and added : “ They ’re basically the same bunch of goons and thugs they ’ve been for the last 50 years ” .
CNN said Cafferty was expressing an opinion about the Chinese government , but the Foreign Ministry demanded an apology and accused the network of trying to drive a wedge between the Chinese people and leadership .
The lawsuits come amid a wave of criticism in China against Western news outlets in the wake of recent unrest in Tibet and disruptions to the Beijing Olympic torch relay abroad .
In New York , Liang Shubing , the beautician , and Li Lilan , a Beijing - based elementary school instructor , claimed Cafferty ’s words insulted all Chinese people and “ intentionally caused mental harm ” to the plaintiffs , the Ta Kung Pao newspaper reported on Thursday .
Six lawyers were handling the case for Liang and Li , it said .
“ The $ 1.3 billion averages out to $ 1 per Chinese person , so it is n’t much , ” the newspaper quoted a lawyer as saying .
Asked if China supported the action against CNN , Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang
Yu characterized it as “ spontaneous activity by Chinese civilians ” .
“ We will wait and see CNN ’s response , ” Jiang told a news conference , referring to the Foreign Ministry ’s request for a full apology .
“ We hope CNN will take this seriously , because what CNN said and did has not only hurt China ’s feelings , but also CNN ’s own image . ”
Republicans lost a long - held House seat Saturday after trying to bring down the Democratic candidate by aligning him with Barack Obama .
Don Cazayoux defeated Woody Jenkins to represent Louisiana 's Sixth District , a seat held by Republicans for decades , boosting Democrats ' optimism heading in to the fall elections .
Mr. Cazayoux , a state representative , and Mr. Jenkins , a newspaper publisher and well - known former state legislator , were vying for the seat of Republican Rep. Richard Baker , who resigned in February .
Mr. Cazayoux 's victory will increase House Democrats ' majority 235 to 198 .
The victory could also aid Sen .
Obama in making his case to uncommitted , elected superdelegates wary of how the top of the ticket could affect their own races in November .
Elected superdelegates comprise about half of the 795 officials who cast ballots at the Democrats ' national convention to choose the party 's presidential nominee .

Home secretary wants antisocial youths to be openly filmed and hounded at home
Police should be harassing badly behaved youths by openly filming them and hounding them at home to make their lives as uncomfortable as possible , the home secretary will say today .
The crime initiative is part of a government strategy to win back voters by proposing more radical approaches to tackling deep seated problems .
In a speech in London the home secretary , Jacqui Smith , will acknowledge that the number of antisocial behaviour orders being issued is falling , but will argue that there has been a shift to the use of parental orders instead .
As part of the crackdown on bad behaviour , she will urge police forces across the country to follow the example of Essex police , who have mounted four - day " frame and shame " operations by filming and repeatedly stopping identified persistent offenders on problem estates .
The programme in Essex has been successful , even though it may raise human rights issues about such tough tactics , especially if those harassed by the police have not been found guilty of any criminal offence .
Smith will say : " There is no let - up in tackling antisocial behaviour .
We know that getting in early to stop troublemakers works , but I want stronger action to deal with persistent offenders .
I want police and local agencies to focus on them by giving them a taste of their own medicine : daily visits , repeated warnings and relentless filming of offenders to create an environment where there is nowhere to hide .
" There can be no excuse for inaction while people still fear for the safety of the streets and estates where they live .
We will do more to protect them .
We all need to sharpen our resolve to tackle both the symptoms and the causes of antisocial behaviour . "
The government has been accused by the Conservatives of going soft on its previous " respect " agenda , closing down its respect unit and placing a new emphasis on youth clubs and play .
The National Audit Office has also criticised the high number of breaches of Asbos , arguing that ministers have little idea what measures are most effective .
Boris Johnson announced yesterday that he was imposing a ban on the drinking of alcohol on all tubes and buses .
He has also raised the prospect of forming 100 Saturday schools where children are drilled to march and learn manners .
Smith will be briefed at a conference in London today on the Essex operation by its two creators , Inspector Jon Burgess and Sergeant Gavin Brock .
The police decided to target persistent offenders with filming techniques first used in identifying hunt saboteurs and football hooligans .
An Essex police spokesman said : " The aim is to target a small group of persistent offenders by openly filming them , knocking on their doors , following them on the estate and repeatedly searching them , as well as warning them in no uncertain terms that local people have identified them as lawbreakers . "
He claimed a four - day blitz in Basildon , which was followed up a few months later , had dramatically reduced offending , and proved highly popular with residents .
The scheme , codenamed operation Leopard , was approved by Essex 's Chief Constable , Roger Baker , after specific estates had been identified as crime hotspots , with more than 20 offences reported each week .
The police followed 14 people in their teens and early 20s .
Each was well known to the force , having built up criminal records for offences such as intimidation , burglary , criminal damage , antisocial behaviour and vehicle crime .
Three surveillance officers spearheaded the operation , backed by uniformed police and community support officers .
A total of 60 stops were carried out .
As a result of other changes being introduced by the Home Office , it will be easier to make these stops without needing to make a full record .
Ministers will defend the fall in the number of Asbos issued by claiming other techniques such as acceptable behaviour contracts and parenting orders are proving more effective .
Critics claim Asbos have become a badge of honour .
Acceptable behaviour contracts ( ABCs ) are written agreements between a young person , the local housing office or registered social landlord , and the local police in which the person agrees not to carry out a series of identifiable behaviours which have been defined as antisocial .
The contracts are primarily aimed at young people aged between 10 and 18 .
( CNN ) --
Nearly three - quarters of all Americans think the economy is in a recession , according to a national poll released Monday .
Seventy - four percent of those questioned in a CNN / Opinion Research Corp. survey say the economy has entered a recession .
That figure is up from 66 percent who felt that way in a similar survey last month .
The number stood at 61 percent in January and 46 percent in October .
It 's no surprise then that the economy remains the key issue in the public 's mind .
By a 2 - 1 margin , it tops the Iraq war as the No. 1 issue for Americans in their choice for president .

" Forty - two percent of those polled say the economy is the biggest issue on their minds , nearly double the amount who felt that way in October , the last time Iraq topped the list as the most important issue , " said Keating Holland , CNN 's polling director .
Watch more on the sinking dollar and rising oil prices »
Democrats and Republicans seem to differ about the state of the economy .
Nine in 10 Democrats questioned said the economy is in a recession , while 54 percent of Republicans agreed with that assessment .
Iraq ranks as the second most important issue , at 21 percent , followed by health care at 18 percent , terrorism at 10 percent and immigration at 7 percent .
Three in 10 of those questioned say the U.S. is in a serious recession , with an equal amount describing the recession as moderate .
Sixteen percent call it a " mild recession . "
Watch experts on the economy »
" The 29 percent who say we 're in a serious recession is larger than the number of Americans who felt that way during the last recession at the start of the current Bush administration , but it 's nowhere near the 46 percent who felt that way about the recession of the early 1990s , when George W. Bush 's father was in the White House , " Holland said .
So when will these economic blues likely go away ?
A majority of those polled , 53 percent , say the recession will last more than a year , 18 percent say it will continue for another six months to a year , and 2 percent say the economic downturn will be over in less than six months .

Building blocks
" Atom " is the brand name for Intel 's newly - launched ultramobile processor line , but it could just as well be the name for Intel 's next - generation 45 nm microarchitecture .
This new core microarchitecture , codenamed Nehalem , forms the basic building block from which Intel will assemble the brains for everything from high - end servers to svelte notebooks .
Insofar as Nehalem represents a lot more than just a new processor , it 's a significant shift for Intel at almost every level .
In this article , I 'll give a general overview of Nehalem , focusing on the major changes and big new features that the architecture will eventually bring to Intel 's entire x86 processor line .
A more in - depth examination of Nehalem from me will show up later in the spring ; for now , read on for the highlights .
Here 's what you need to know about Nehalem .
It 's the bandwidth , stupid
Moore 's Law has given processor designers an embarrassment of transistor riches , and nowhere is that more apparent than in Intel 's 45 nm Nehalem processor .
Debuting in 4 - and 8 - core variants later this year , Nehalem packs a ton of hardware into a single processor socket .
( Early numbers put the transistor count of a quad - core Nehalem at 781 million ; no numbers for the 8 - core model have appeared yet . )
But trying to feed all of that hardware with the Intel platform 's existing frontside bus architecture would be folly .
So , just as importantly , Nehalem also sounds the long - overdue death knell for Intel 's positively geriatric frontside bus architecture .
The radical change in Intel 's system bandwidth situation that Intel 's new QuickPath Interconnect ( QPI ) represents is perhaps the largest single factor that shaped Nehalem 's design .
Between QuickPath and Nehalem 's integrated memory controller , a Nehalem processor will have access to an unprecedented amount of aggregate bandwidth , especially in two - and four - socket implementations .
What this means is that Intel no longer has to equip its processors with freakishly large unified caches designed to mitigate the effects of the bandwidth starvation with which Intel platforms currently struggle .
The chipmaker is now free to use all of the transistors that Moore 's Law affords more flexibly and intelligently , and this freedom has profound effects on every aspect of Nehalem .
Let 's take a look at what this bandwidth improvement means for Nehalem - based products across all segments , from servers to notebooks .
Remixing the microprocessor
In some ways , Nehalem is Intel 's most significant processor since the Pentium 4 , insofar as it signifies a major shift for the company 's x86 strategy .
The ill - fated Pentium 4 was a relatively radical design conceived with clockspeed in mind .
Nehalem , in contrast , is a more progressive evolution of Intel 's existing , mobile - oriented Core 2 products ; all of its changes are made with a view to exploiting the large amounts of parallelism that Moore 's Law affords at the 45nm process node and to taking advantage of QPI 's bandwidth .
Because of this emphasis on parallelism and bandwidth , " Nehalem , " broadly conceived , is less of a " processor " in the classical sense than it is a set of building blocks that can be assembled in different configurations for different market segments .
A four - core Nehalem processor , with three DDR3 channels and four QPI links
Nehalem - derived processors — if it 's still appropriate to call them " processors " and not " systems-on - a- chip " ( SoCs ) — will mix the following elements in different proportions , depending on the platform and product :
Number of cores
Number of memory channels on the integrated memory controller
Type of memory supported ( registered and unregistered DDR3 or FB - DIMM )
Number of links in the QuickPath interface ( for scaling QuickPath bandwidth )
L3 cache size
Power management features
Integrated graphics
That 's quite bit of customization available , and this approach is what will let Intel slip Nehalem into all kinds of market segments .
Indeed , Nehalem 's processor core actually reminds me of the Linux kernel in that it's a small unit that can be augmented in different ways with add - ons so that it fits everything from a set - top box to a supercomputer cluster .
So far , Intel has said that Nehalem will scale from two to eight cores , but the company has talked about only the four - core , server - oriented part .
All Nehalem configurations have a number of Nehalem cores — each with a 32KB , four - way set associative instruction cache , a 32KB , eight - way set associative data cache , and a private , low - latency 256KB L2 cache — all attached to an inclusive L3 cache that will be sized to fit the number of cores and target market .
The four - core part that Intel has detailed weighs in at 781 million transistors , much of which is no doubt the very generous 8 MB L3 cache .
This part also includes an on - die , three - channel DDR3 memory controller and a QuickPath interface that supports four QuickPath links .
As I noted above , the number of memory channels and QuickPath links in other Nehalem - based products can be expected to vary with the part and target market .
I 've never really cared much for labels .
Identity politics and party - line loyalty just seems too tribal to me , and wholly unnecessary in a modern democratic society .
And when there are only two parties that have any real chance of winning in a presidential election , it is almost guaranteed to cause extreme polarization of the two factions .
But one thing is certain : anyone who will openly profess to be a proud Republican today , offering no caveats or apologies , not even a " yeah , I know he 's an idiot , " - that person is what the face of American Republicanism has become .
Republicanism has nothing at all to do with " conservatism " anymore .
It 's become more of a sickness than a legitimate political ideology .
No self - respecting conservative could call himself a Republican by today 's definition .
And that 's why Republicans have only the narrowest of hopes of preventing a total Democratic takeover in the next election .
Their only options :
1. ) Nuke everybody .
All it takes is one , then . . . assured mutual destruction .
2. ) Declare martial law and suspend the elections .
We 're due for another civil war anyhow .
3. ) Recruit another Oswald .
( And another Jack Ruby . )
4. ) Get the Supreme Court to force Democrats to change the name of their party .
After their bright idea to decide unilaterally who would be president in 2000 , the Justices would not dare attempt to override the voters a second time for fear of losing their own skins .
But they could still prove useful to Republicans , who might be able to convince the Court that by calling themselves " Democrats , " the party is guilty of false advertising .
After all , how long has it been since anything was decided in authentic democratic fashion in America ?
The methods above , while certainly not very desirable , are by far the easiest ways for Republicans to keep the Democrats out of the White House .
They certainly have no chance of doing it by ballot .
Since the first three solutions are unquestionably illegal and murderous - as if those two things have mattered to most Republicans in the last seven years - and since the fourth would be a hollow victory , there is only one legitimate avenue that could possibly lead Republicans to occupy the Oval Office in 2009 .
It is a decidedly more difficult path .
5. ) Renounce everything that W. ever said , vote to bring the troops home , close Guantanamo , repeal the Patriot Act , and force Bush , Cheney , Rumsfeld , Gonzales , Mukasey , and John Yoo to demonstrate to the public that waterboarding is not torture by tying them to see - saws on the White House lawn while Condi Rice , Hillary Clinton , and Lindy England pour water down their throats until they all pass out at least twice , broadcast live on FOX News , during prime - time .
Brit Hume and Fred Barnes can cheerlead , while Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly fight over who gets the last ringside seat .
When Bush and his merry band of bumbling bandits have dried out , prosecute them for every demonstrable crime they have committed , from waging an unprovoked , aggressive war , to systematic torture , to warrantless wiretapping of Americans .
Remove every career Justice Dept. employee hired during George W. Bush 's politicizing presidency , and let them reapply for their positions amongst qualified competition and be chosen for their abilities instead of their religious and political beliefs .
Make sure that Karl Rove sees at least as much of the inside of a prison as former Alabama Gov.
Don Siegelman saw after Rove had him prosecuted for his politics instead of for his crimes .
Then the Republicans can pay back all the money they have embezzled , stolen , and taken as bribes , and remove the " income tax " from wages and put it back on capital gains and corporate profits ( where it was intended to be in the first place ) .
Agree to universal healthcare , put the money they have been wasting in Iraq into the Social Security " trust , " and take back half the taxpayer 's money they used to rescue Bear Stearns and use it to help the millions of taxpayers who are losing their homes because of firms like Bear Stearns .
Admit that corporations are NOT " people , " and therefore cannot enjoy the rights afforded to people while bearing none of the responsibilities expected of people .
Give the energy companies a real incentive to " go green " by taking away all the taxpayer subsidies and tax breaks going to Big Oil companies while they make record profits from $ 4 per gallon gas .
Then they can get on their hands and knees to beg America 's forgiveness for not doing all of that in the first place .
Now , that 's a pretty tall order .
But that 's what it would take to keep the Democrats out of the White House - short of persuading Barack Obama to become a Republican .
And not presuming to speak for Mr. Obama , but I have a hunch that if Republicans would do all of those things , Obama would be proud to call himself a Republican .
I know I would .

Getting Take ‘ n’ Bake Pizza Without Gasoline
It may seem a little silly , but in this coming age of expensive gasoline , every trip we make to buy something is going to have to be a decision about whether or not it ’s really worth it .
That $ 10 book at the book store could easy become $ 15 if your car is n’t very efficient and the drive is longer than a few miles .
The same can be said of going out to get coffee , groceries , or even Take ‘ n ’
Bake pizza .
EcoModder forum member Ben Nelson recently posted about his inventive approach to getting pizza without using any gas .
He took his DIY electric motorcycle , which is already pretty sweet , and attached a little delivery tray to the back , the likes of which I have n’t seen since the last time I was in Japan ( where almost all deliveries are done on Honda Super Cubs ) :
There ’s no arguing that the bike itself is n’t a sweet ride , but it gets even better when you see that not only can you carry a pizza , but that you have room for an extra-large :
Of course , the bike has to get its electricity from somewhere , but since it ’s much more efficient than an internal combustion engine it uses less and can get power from renewable sources like green energy providers or your home ’s own solar panels .
So , I applaud Ben for his creative methods of reducing gas use , and hope that others will follow in his footsteps .
Especially with gas prices hitting all - time highs in the US , the case against gasoline is getting incredibly strong .

71 minutes of politics , 26 minutes of crime , 12 minutes of disasters and 10 minutes of celebrities .
Science , technology , health and the environment received just six minutes of coverage ( with health and health care accounting for half of that . )
Newspapers , network news and online news all provided more science coverage , though not by much .
Why is science so poorly covered by cable television ?
I 'm tempted to cite the complexity of scientific topics and the superficiality of cable news , but I 'm not sure that 's correct :
After all , it 's perfectly possible to be successful with bad science news , and TV news is n't necessarily stupid .
So – I 'm baffled .
What do you think , Wired Science readers ?

Note : Maybe when the Presidential elections are over , the people campaigning for a science debate will mobilize in support of more and better cable science news .
In the long run , I think that would actually do more for science .*
Note Two :
Do n't feel bad , scientists .
Compared to artists , you 're practically celebrities !
Note Three : Could the failure of cable news networks to cover science be a good thing ?

Smith Electric Vehicles of Britain is working with Ford Motor Company to bring us a pair of electric trucks be based on Ford 's Transit Connect and the F - 650 commercial vehicle and built in America .
The smaller of the two trucks , the Ampere , takes the long - wheelbase Transit Connect and replaces the internal combustion engine with a 50 - kilowatt electric motor and a bank of lithium - ion iron phosphate batteries developed specifically for the vehicle .
Th batteries are covered by a 5 - year / 1000 - cycle warranty .
Smith claims the Ampere is good for 100 miles per charge , will reach 70 mph and can carry close to 1,800 pounds of cargo .
It 's aimed at commercial users in urban areas — couriers and utilities workers , for instance — although it 's not hard to imagine there will be consumer interest in the vehicle .
So does it get here ?*
*
The Ampere is slated to debut next year , alongside Ford 's regular Transit Connect van .
Smith is set to roll out the larger Faraday II , based on Ford 's mighty F - 650 , later this year .
Expect it to employ a 120 - kilowatt motor from Enova in place of the usual 6.7 - or 7.2 - liter diesel engine and either lithium - ion iron phosphate or sodium nickel chloride batteries .
Either way , look for a top speed of 50 mph and a range of 150 miles .
The Ampere and Faraday II join Smith 's Ford - based Newton EV , currently the world 's largest road - going EV , in the American market .
Based in the English county of Tyne and Wear , Smith has a small facility in Fresno , California , but in December , the company announced that it will open a much larger U.S. factory in 2010 with a production capacity of 10,000 vehicles per year .

We 've been hearing for years of that certain elusive breed of human that is extra-sensitive to certain radio frequencies and electromagnetic fields , so it was only a time before those wire - tethered folks took shot across our wireless - loving bow .
According to a local NBC news affiliate , Sante Fe resident Arthur Firstenberg ( not pictured right ) has organized a group of electro - sensitive citizens to rally against WiFi and cellphone use in public space , claiming it violates the Americans with Disabilities Act .
No doubt it is indeed a sticky situation , but we 're pretty sure Firstenberg and co are going to have to do a little better than claiming to " get chest pain and it does n't go away right away " if they really expect an entire city ( or country ) to cease using wireless communications .

KUALA LUMPUR ( Reuters ) - A Malaysian woman woke up to a real - life nightmare , discovering that the naked man who had slipped into her bed in the middle of the night was a thief , not her husband , a newspaper said on Tuesday .
The 36 - year - old housewife was asleep when the thief , noticing that her husband was fast asleep on the couch , quietly stripped off and lay down beside her , the Star newspaper said , quoting a police report filed in the eastern state of Terengganu .
The dozing woman ’s suspicions were raised when she spoke to him and his voice sounded strange , the paper said .
“ She then went to another room and found her husband fast asleep on the couch .
That ’s when she screamed , causing the thief to flee by leaping out the window together with the stolen items , ” it added .
01:23 am - Geeky Musings on Terminator : The Sarah Conner Chronicles
Watching the new season of Battlestar Galactica reminded me how much I like the new show Terminator : The Sarah Conner Chronicles – it is similar to BSG in a number of obvious and non-obvious ways , except that in The Sarah Conner Chronicles , the protagonists ( or at least Sarah and perhaps John Conner ) seem to be heading towards the idea that the only way to stop the cycle of violence and prevent the war is to find some way to defuse or avoid the conflict ( or at least that ’s my guess ) , while in BSG , if humanity survives is will solely be through luck or fate , and not because any of the characters has done anything remotely positive or humane .

In any case , in addition to being one of the most definitely feminist shows on TV , I also like T:SCC because it ’s fundamentally about the sort of time travel where nothing is fixed and the past and future can be changed .
I was thinking about the ( at this point exceptionally complex ) timestream of the show .
Looking at the first movie , it ’s clear that we were watching at least the 2nd actual timeline .
In the original timeline ( before any time travel occurred ) it ’s obvious that John Conner was never born , because Kyle Reese never went back in time .
Instead , presumably the war happened sometime later than 1999 ( since the 1999 war happened earlier because of access to cyborg technology ) and I ’m betting that humanity did very badly indeed .
So , somehow one of the few survivors , Kyle Reese , gets access to the time machine and goes back into the 1980s .
There , he presumably tries to warn people , fails utterly , and instead hooks up with Sarah Conner , they have a kid , and Kyle Reese and Sarah Conner raise this child with the knowledge of the coming war – putting him in the perfect position to be a rebel leader who helps the survivors do a whole lot better than they did in the timeline the first Kyle Reese is from .
The first movie started with this timeline , where John Conner knew he had to send Kyle Reese back , both to protect Conner ’s mother from the terminator and to become his father .
So , we already have a third timeline , because this time Sarah Conner is attacked by a terminator robot and Kyle Reese is killed by it .
Then , in the end of the 2nd movie , Sarah Conner eliminates this timeline by destroying the remains of this robot , creating timeline number four , where the war happens in 2011 .
Then , the show starts with Cameron taking Sarah and John Conner from the 1990s to 2007 , creating timeline five , where John Conner is around a decade younger than he previously was .
Sarah Conner destroying the first model of " the Turk " and Derek Reese killing Andy Goode have likely created another timeline that is again at least slightly different .
So , now we ’re up to at least 6 separate timelines , several of which have very significant differences from one another .
However , all of them have time - travel , AI ’s Skynet , and the war .
Since the show has categorically stated that AIs are going to evolve , and given that a ( admittedly skilled and brilliant ) hobbyist built one in his spare room , they clearly not exceptionally hard to create .
At this point , John Conner could likely make one .
So , stopping AIs from coming into existence is clearly impossible , which means that stopping the war means finding some way to avoid having them attack humanity .
This is tougher than it sounds , since human resistance fighters from the future have already been attacking every proto - AI they can find , making the AI ’s paranoia about humanity all too justified .
This is why the only answer seems to be to find some way to get the two sides to stop destroying one another .
So , if the show has a positive ending ( and given the presence of characters like Sarah Conner who seem both moral and heroic , this seems likely ) , that ending will almost certainly be finding some way for AIs and humans to exist together .
That of course spawned a nifty ( to me at least ) idea for an RPG – one taking place in the future of that setting , where the war has been prevented and humans and AIs have just begun to learn to coexist .
However , the game would n’t mostly take place in this present , it would take place in the past , where a time patrol made up of human and robot agents ( likely in teams that must legally have members of both ) go back to prevent dissidents from going back in time and screwing up the obviously fairly fragile peace and the equally fragile timeline .
In addition , the PCs would need to deal with human resistance fighters and terminator robots that were sent back in the past before the war was ended .
These agents would still be there and could still cause problems , and the PCs would either have to convince them of the error of their ways or deal with them in some more direct fashion .
In effect , you ’d have Terminator : The Time Patrol Chronicles , which sounds like great fun to play in , but would of course suffer from all of the many problems that any time - travel RPG has for the person attempting to run it .
This is definitely on the list of campaigns I ’ll attempt to see if teaotter
In any case , one of the nifty features of such a setting is coming back to the future and finding it drastically different and then going back and fixing it .
There ’s lots of possible fun to be had there , including having the PCs return to a future which looks almost identical to The Matrix and having to jack into it to get access to the historical records so they could find out where someone tampered with things and how to set everything right .

Reminds me of one of my potential campaigns : take the premise of Samurai Jack , but assume that multiple eras spawned heroes that were a threat to the big bad guy , and each time , the big bad guy kicked them down the timestream to deal with later when he was more powerful .
Now the champions of different times have all met up ...

Tar baby ?
In a 20 - page memo on GOP electoral woes , Rep. Tom Davis ( R - Va. ) repeatedly misspells Barack Obama ’s name – it ’s one R , congressman , not two -- and then manages to use the racially charged term “ tar baby ” in a paragraph about Obama and immigration .
“ Remember , ” Davis writes , “ Hispanic voters are a swing group in this election and future elections .
John McCain , being from a border state , may be out of sync with many Republicans but he has standing among Hispanics .
Barrack Obama has not made the sale to Hispanic voters .
Thus , this issue is a tar baby for anyone who touches it , with land mines everywhere . ”
Well , that Permanent Majority sure did n’t last long .
Tuesday ’s special election in Mississippi , which yielded an eight - point victory for a Democrat in an overwhelmingly Republican district , has signaled to all observers what we ’ve known , or at least hoped for , for years ; Republicans are doomed .
This has been the case for quite some time - the 2006 elections certainly seemed to indicate serious trouble for the Republican Party - but Mississippi pulled the curtain on the current sad state of the GOP .
In the aftermath of Travis Childers ’ election , it has become impossible to ignore or deny the fact that the Republican Party is on the verge of disaster .
The GOP had absolutely no legitimate excuses for losing this election , as DavidNYC wrote on Wednesday .
They had a decent candidate ( in their fashion ) , running in a strongly red district , they spent vats of money , used all kinds of popular surrogates which we could n’t match , and engaged in the same tired old " Liberals are EVIL ! " scarecrowery that they 've practiced for twenty years .
None of it worked , apparently .
Not only did they lose the seat , they got beaten quite badly .
They tried everything to hang on to a seat that should never have been competitive in the first place , and they failed in grand fashion .
It is the perfect indicator that the Republican brand is in historically dire straits - they ’re in the worst position they have seen since 1974 , perhaps since 1964 , perhaps since 1932 - and the nation is poised for a genuine Democratic ascendancy .
And everybody knows it .
The traditional media has noticed ; indeed , as as DemFromCT notes , they ca n’t get enough of this new narrative about the diseased Republican Party .
And the Republican Party has most definitely noticed .
NRCC Chairman Tom Cole , who will presumably take the brunt of the blame for GOP losses this fall , commented
" I think obviously when you lose three of these in a row you have to go beyond campaign tactics , " Cole said , adding that it brings up the question : " Is there something wrong with your product ? "
This is a rather remarkable statement , considering that just a few short years ago , Republicans truly believed that this " product " would enable them to build a Permanent Republican Majority , ultimately restricting Democrats to the status of a regional party .
Cole is far from alone in noting the grand failure of selling traditional Republicanism .
Rep. Mark Kirk , a moderate representing a Democratic - leaning district ( whose reelection bid is in serious trouble ) , feels the same way .
The GOP ’s loss in Mississippi on Tuesday underscored for many Republicans that the party ’s old playbook — one that relies heavily on branding Democrats as liberal tax - raisers , rallying around social issues such as abortion and guns , and using the president and vice president as campaign surrogates — is n’t working any more .
" The playbook has n’t worked in my district ever , " said Rep. Mark Kirk ( R - Ill . ) , who has been pushing his party to adopt an agenda geared toward more moderate suburban voters for the past three years .
" The politics of the 1980s when that playbook was written is out of date . "
Even rock - ribbed conservatives , like rising GOP star Eric Cantor , understand the party ’s need to rebrand itself .
Cantor acknowledged that efforts to brand a candidate as " too liberal " or " too out of sync " wo n’t cut it with voters .
" What does work , though , is a realization that the paradigm has been shifted , " Cantor said .
" This country is tired of excuses and does n’t want to hear about ‘ too liberal ’ or ‘ too this ’ or ‘ too that . ’
What they want to hear is solutions . "
The paradigm has shifted , indeed .
We are entering a new era in American politics , and the Republicans have to figure out how to live in it .
Their old ideas , old tactics , and stale brand are hopelessly out of place .
Republican Rep. Tom Davis , one of the better strategic minds in the GOP , has gone so far as to raise the spectre of a permanent GOP minority :
Do n’t just put a new wrapper on the product and hire a new sales crew .
Let ’s revamp , consistent with our principles and remember that this election is about independent voters .
Even if we get every Republican out to vote , we lose without Independents .
Forget the Democrats .
They ’ve been waiting to get back since the Florida recount .
It ’s all about the Independents , or we drop to a 170 - 180 seat permanent minority .
Yes , we ’ll be comfortable in our caucus , but we ’ll be irrelevant for the next decade .
It ’s particularly noteworthy that during their 12 - year reign in Congress , from 1994 to 2006 , the Republicans were never able to make the Democrats into a " 170 or 180 – seat permanent minority " .
If the Democratic Party was indeed at its lowest ebb during the Bush administration , we ’re actually in pretty good shape indeed .
So the GOP looks to John McCain as their savior now ... a man whose entire electoral viability is centered around being seen as a " maverick " , an atypical Republican .
The rise of McCain as their champion is not without irony , since the 71 - year - old Arizona senator has quarreled with his own party for years on issues as diverse as immigration , campaign finance reform and global warming .
But it is precisely that independent streak that is drawing Republicans to his coattails , hoping he can cleanse them of the stain of gridlocked Washington .
Eric Cantor , Republican chief deputy whip in the House of Representatives , told reporters that the McCain brand was healthier than that of his party .
" John McCain is a demonstrated vote getter among independents , and his message and what he will be able to do in this election is extremely important . "
Frankly , the only chance John McCain has in this election is to keep selling the nonsense that he is n’t a normal Republican ( and it is nonsense ) ... yet the party establishment is looking to him to help avoid disastrous downticket losses .
McCain 's job is to save the party ... by running away from the party .
The Republican brand is so toxic , at this point , that the only chance for GOP success is to eschew the brand of their own party label .
So , what the hell happened to that Permanent Majority ?
As DemFromCT wrote this morning , the true beauty of the special elections in Mississippi and Louisiana is that the Republican Party , the folks who once had designs on a Permanent Majority which would relegate us forever to the status of a regional party , have ultimately succeeded in transforming themselves into a regional party .
Their own hubristic eagerness to demonize anything and everything Democratic has ultimately backfired ; it is the Republican party which is the extremist party now , and the Democratic party which is the coalition party .
Chris Cillizza breaks down the recent AB / WaPo poll :
Not surprisingly , Obama holds his largest lead over McCain ( 18 points ) in the Northeast -- an area that has become increasingly dominated by Democrats in recent elections .
But , Obama also holds a lead in the traditional battleground area of the Midwest -- where Obama takes 54 percent to McCain 's 41 percent -- and in the Republican - leaning territory of the West where Obama holds a double - digit lead at the moment .
And , even in the South , where Republicans have dominated at the federal level for much of the past four decades , Obama is competitive ; McCain takes 49 percent to 45 percent for the Illinois senator .
While McCain trails by double digits in three of the four regions of the country , he actually far over performs his own party 's showing in the Post poll .
Asked which party they trusted to " do a better job of coping with the main problems the nation faces over the next few years , " voters across the country opted for Democrats by wide margins .
In the Northeast , Democrats outpaced Republicans by 29 points while the margin was 26 points in the Midwest .
The news was n't much better for Republicans in the West ( Democrats + 18 ) or the South ( Democrats +15 ) .
It is the Democratic party which is making inroads into the West and South , while the Republicans have now failed to hold seats in successive special elections deep within the heart of their Southern stronghold .
Even rural voters , long part of the GOP base , are abandoning the party :
Less than six months from the November election , Sen. John McCain is tied with Sen.
Hillary Clinton among rural voters in battleground states while the Arizona Republican holds a nine point lead over Sen. Barack Obama .
Republican extremism has driven away a good percentage of the voters who gave them their narrow victories over the past 15 years .
It ’s easy to say that they should moderate their image going forward , and that probably is what they should do .
Unfortunately , they ’re hamstrung by their base .
Many things have gone wrong for Bush , but the underlying problem is his relationship to the constituency that elected him .
Bush 's debt to his big donors and to religious conservatives has boxed him in and pitted him against the national consensus on various issues .
His extremism is undermining Rove 's realignment .
The problem has become clear with Bush 's difficulties in filling Sandra Day O'Connor 's slot on the Supreme Court .
The Harriet Miers nomination was an attempt to satisfy both the militant conservative base and the eternally moderate American electorate .
With the Alito nomination , Bush has acknowledged that splitting this difference is impossible .
Faced with a choice , he has chosen , once again , to dance with the ones who brought him .
But by appointing a superconservative , Bush risks propelling his increasingly beleaguered administration even further toward the right - hand margin — a place where his party cannot win future national elections .
The Republicans are in thrall to their hard - core right wing base , the Norquists and Dobsons of the world , and this prevents them from recapturing the political center , as DHinMI wrote in his piece on Tom Davis memo .
Ironically , Davis ’ own U.S. Senate bid was thwarted by the right wing of the Virginia Republican Party , who apparently preferred nominating the weak but reliably " conservative " Jim Gilmore to one of their smartest and wisest strategists .
Since the 1990's , the Republicans have been willing hostages to their base .
Republican office holders are unwilling to go against their base , because they know they will be attacked by their base , and quite possibly targeted by fundie groups and Club for Growth , and most likely draw an extremist primary opponent ( like the ones who 've defeated Republican incumbent moderates Wayne Gilchrest and Joe Schwarz , and who blocked Davis ' own path to the Republican nomination for Senate in Virginia ) .
I do n't have any sympathy for the Republicans .
But I do believe it must be horrible knowing that if they do n't eschew the extreme right positions they 've adopted over the years , they will get slaughtered in the general election , but breaking from the extreme right means they will not make it through party primaries .
The GOP has fallen this far for a number of reasons , but chief among them is their failure to adequately court middle - class voters who are n’t completely hostile to science .
Unfortunately for them , that comprises an incredibly large swath of the country .
For some time , they were able to win enough of these voters to hold a majority in Congress and eke out two incredibly narrow presidential - election victories , but they were never included in the coalition .
It ’s easy to forget that the Democratic Party was already experiencing a resurgence prior to September 11 , albeit not on the grand scale we ’re seeing now .
Bush , of course , lost the popular vote in 2000 , an election which saw the Democratic Party regain a majority in the U.S. Senate .
Democrats also managed to gain seats in the House in three successive elections after the 1994 debacle .
The Republican seizure of the national security issue after 9/11 bought them time as a party , but it was hardly a permanent fix .
For the GOP to hold national - security voters , two things were necessary ; first , the issue had to remain the top voter priority , and second , the Republicans had to actually maintain their credibility on it ( which , of course , they did not ) .
In all honesty , it ’s likely that Republican dominance would have fallen even earlier if they had n’t managed to seize the national - security issue after 9/11 .
Their mistake , however , was believing that national security alone would keep middle - class voters in their column .
Unfortunately for them , their credibility on national security is spent , thanks in large part to the Iraq fiasco .
Now , in increasing numbers , these voters are finding a home in the Democratic Party .
This is not because the party has moved appreciably to the center .
Rather , it has become the party of the left and the center , the party for everyone who is n’t either insanely wealthy or part of the religious right .
Another component of the Republican fall is their eagerness to practice the worst kind of divisive regional politics .
We ’ve seen it in their most recent ads in Louisiana and Mississippi , assailing " San Francisco " liberal values .
Have you ever seen a Democratic ad criticizing " Alabama values ? "
Then there ’s Dick Armey ’s foul gem from 2004 , assailing my hometown :
The state is also a recurring villain among Republicans , a view distilled in a wisecrack by a former House majority leader , Dick Armey of Texas , when Democrats announced that their 2004 convention would be held in Boston .
" If I were a Democrat , " Armey said , " I would feel a heck of a lot more comfortable in Boston than , say , America . "
Strange , but I can't remember Ted Kennedy ever saying that Dallas is n't part of America .
We do n't do that sort of thing .
Republicans do .
Creating this us - and - them regional dynamic no doubt helped the Republicans lock down their Southern base , but it also prevented them from expanding into other regions of the country .
It ’s instructive that the party which wished to create a permanent majority thought it would be a good idea to do so by writing off entire sections of the country , and it ’s no wonder that Chris Shays is the last Republican representative from New England .
I think the Republican dream of a permanent majority was always hubris .
Their coalition was never that broad , and never that strong , even when they managed to win .
And they did n't do a damned thing to expand beyond that coalition , to win new voters into their country by attempting to find common ground with centrists .
At the height of Republican supremacy , 59 million Americans voted for John Kerry in 2004 , and the GOP made no effort to court any of those voters into joining them .
One final note on the late Republican Permanent Majority .
Karl Rove sought to be the new Mark Hanna , William McKinley ’s political strategist in the 1896 presidential election .
Hanna ’s great achievement was to craft a Republican coalition in 1896 which reduced Democrats to being a Southern regional party , a status they enjoyed essentially until 1932 .
Rove and his partners in crime have essentially done the same thing as Hanna did ... for the Democratic Party .
Namco Bandai is shuttering between 50 and 60 arcades in Japan , and it 's laying the blame squarely on Nintendo 's shoulders .
" A lot of the types of games that people played at an arcade can now be done at home , " said company spokesman Yuji Machida .
Namco figures that Japanese kids are saving up their pocket money to buy the latest and greatest
Wii game or accessory , which is clearly unacceptable .
Sega Sammy also has plans to close about 100 of its arcades , but there 's no word of finger pointing from that camp .
While we 're certain the Wii's popularity has a little something to do with it , perhaps Japanese gamers are just beginning to learn something their American counterparts got down years ago : why leave the couch ?

9/11 truth groups dissect Rumsfeld 's ' another attack ' quip Muriel Kane
Published : Monday May 19 , 2008

Print This Email
This A newly - revealed speech delivered by former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld before an audience of Pentagon - sponsored military analysts in December 2006 is providing ample grist for 9/11 conspiracy theorists .
An audio recording of the speech was one of a large number of items released by the Pentagon on May 8 as a result of Freedom of Information requests .
The New York Times had filed the requests in the course of preparing its expose of the Pentagon 's use of supposedly independent retired military officers to present its message on network news shows .
Speaking a month after the Democratic Party had recaptured majorities in both houses of Congress , and just following his own resignation as Secretary of Defense , Rumsfeld suggested that a new 9/11 could be the corrective for American complacency : " This President 's pretty much a victim of success .
We have n't had an attack in five years .
The perception of the threat is so low in this society that it's not surprising that the behavior pattern reflects a low threat assessment .
The same thing 's in Europe , there 's a low threat perception .
The correction for that , I suppose , is an attack .
And when that happens , then everyone gets energized for another [ inaudible ] and it's a shame we do n't have the maturity to recognize the seriousness of the threats ... the lethality , the carnage , that can be imposed on our society is so real and so present and so serious that you 'd think we'd be able to understand it . "
The audio received no notice for several days , until blogger Jack Gillis discovered it in the course of a thread at Talking Points Memo devoted to combing through the documents .
Gillis then made the full audio available at his blog , along with brief quotes from some of the more " chilling " moments .
Jason Linkins at the Huffington Post carried the story along by providing a complete transcription of Rumsfeld 's " extraordinary " remark .
At that point , awareness of the speech exploded .
However , while moderate bloggers saw it merely as Rumsfeld " blurt[ing ] out the secret wet - dream fantasy of every warmongering neocon Republican , " others found it far more sinister .
Rob Kall , the executive editor of OpEd News , was one of the first to suggest the obvious conclusion .
" Call me a conspiracy theorist , " he wrote on May 14 .
" Because this slips too easily off Rumsfelds reptilian tongue .
Too easily because perhaps its not at all a new idea .
Perhaps it is an idea that , for him , for all the propagandist sell - out generals , this is not new , that is actually , already tried and true .
One of the oft cited premises of the 9/11 Truth movement is that the attack on the towers was the pearl harbor - like event that the neocons anticipated would be necessary to move the US to embrace the aggressive militaristic tactics manifested in Iraq .
Here , we have Rumsfeld casually joking about it not a smoking gun , but , perhaps , a clear ' tell ' in poker parlance , indicating ready ability to think in these terms . "
A few days later , PrisonPlanet.com , a website devoted to conspiracy theories , was featuring the Rumsfeld remarks as something far more than " casually joking . "
Editor Paul Joseph Watson described the tape as revealing " former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld talking with top military analysts about how a flagging Neo - Con political agenda could be successfully restored with the aid of another terrorist attack on America . "
" Rumsfeld 's admission that the correction for dwindling support of the Neo - Con imperial crusade is another terror attack is perhaps the most startling and blatant indication that 9/11 was an inside job , " Watson continued .
" How much more evidence do we need to confirm that the Neo - Con hierarchy in control of the U.S. government are instigating and exploiting terror in the pursuit of their own domestic and geopolitical agenda ? "
Larry Chin at GlobalResearch.ca was equally emphatic , writing , " Placing the new evidence against previously revealed 9/11 - related acts on the part of Rumsfeld , his guilt is overt and obvious .
Recall that it was Rumsfeld who enthusiastically penned the ' Go Massive ' memo , gleefully declaring the Bush administration finally had the green light to kill : ' Not only UBL ( Usama bin Laden ) .
Go massive .
Sweep it all up .
Things related and not . '
As the Bush administrations war ensued in earnest , Rumsfeld gloated to the New York Times that 9/11 provided ' the kind of opportunities that World War II offered , to refashion the world . ' "
In an interview with conservative commentator Rusty Humphries for a Pentagon radio talk show in September 2006 , three months before his speech to the military analysts , Rumsfeld was asked about " this new wave of conspiracy theories on September 11th . "
He replied , " I suppose there have always been people in the world who subscribe to conspiracy theories and are -- you just almost have to suspend the idea of disbelief .
I can't imagine people saying -- writing books the way they 're writing them , articles of what they 're writing , believing what they believe -- people contending that the -- September 11th was not an attack by al Qaeda , even though when the al Qaeda take credit for it . "
Humphries went on to say , " I talk to terrorists personally , and they tell me every single time , it was the Jews that sent the planes in to start a war between us and Islam .
They also told me one time that it was the Jews that sent Monica Lewinsky in to have sex with Bill Clinton so they could run America .
You like that one ? "
" My goodness , " Rumsfeld replied .
CHARLES 'TRUSTED AIDE ' IN GAY RAPE COVER UP SHOCKER - FREE SPEECH DEAD IN THE UK
The story they tried to ban ( successfully ) in the British courts >>
Neanderthals had language comparable to that of Homo sapiens , Bordeaux - based archaeologist Francisco D’Errico told participants in the Evolang conference in Barcelona this morning ( Saturday , March 15 , 2008 ) .
This claim totally discards the older Big Bang theory that said language arose only very recently ( 40 to 75 thousand years ago ) , and also challenges the Out - of - Africa theory that proposes Homo sapiens emerged in Africa about 200 thousand years ago and spread over the rest of the world , carrying language and culture with them , beginning about 60 thousand years ago .
A new history will have to be written .
D’Errico based his claim on what he called material “ proxies ” for symbolic communication , in essence pigments used for body painting and carved materials used for body ornamentation ( beads and other decorative wear ) .
His argument that these proxies can be taken as persuasive evidence of language on the basis that
they are symbolic , i.e. , used to represent something rather than merely be something .
A tool like a hand axe is useful and shaped , but is what it is .
A body marking redefines something about the body , changing the brute fact of the body to something else , if you share the understanding of the person who has marked her or his body .
their conventions and manufacture are transmitted , i.e. , to understand the symbolism and make the materials , the society has to be able to instruct newcomers ( children ) into the meanings and methods of the artifacts .
He makes a further “ uniformitarian ” argument that similar symbolic abilities reflect similar communicative abilities .
Thus , if we can find proxies that are symbolic and dependent upon transmission , we have evidence of the a language - using species .
D’Errico provided extensive evidence of very old use of pigments , going back perhaps almost 300 thousand years in Africa .
Body ornaments came later , but still over 100 thousand years ago .
Evidence from Israel , for example , may date as far back as 125 thousand years ago .
Body ornaments like beads require more work than pigmentation , and an examination of them indicates the existence of tools for putting holes in the beads , strings for wearing the beads ( insides of the bead holes show evidence of having been well eroded , suggesting long use ) , and the need for trade to get pigments used in coloring the beads ( the bead material and the pigment material came from different locations ) .
This abundant evidence has killed the idea that language began with some kind of explosive symbolic activity about 40,000 years ago , although the idea continues to be taken for granted in much of the popular press .
The evidence for Neanderthal language is based on their use of pigments and body ornaments .
Some have argued that this usage may have reflected contact with Homo sapiens .
D’Errico said that even if that were the case , the ability of Neanderthal to recognize and make use of an idea would be evidence of their symbolic capacity , but then he rendered the objection mute by reporting Neanderthal body ornaments dating to about 65 thousand years ago , well before any contact with Homo sapiens .
Neanderthal body pigment was black , unlike the most popular red ochre in the sapiens line .
Mitochondrial evidence suggests
Neanderthals were red headed with pale skin , and therefore had different ornamental needs than black - skinned red ochre users in Africa .
The existence of modern language capacities in Neanderthals implies that all the biological capacities required to support language production pre-date the split between the Neanderthal and sapiens lineages .
D’Errico ( and a number of other presenters at this conference ) mentioned recent findings that the Neanderthal Fox P2 gene associated with language matched that of H sapiens .
His claim was also supported by research indicating the human lineage at lost its air sacs at least 800 thousand years ago ( see : Fossil Evidence of Speech ? )
If the full biological package was that old , there is no cultural reason to stand with the Out - of - Africa theory .
A hundred thousand years ago , pigments and orientation were scattered at sites outside of Africa , indicating the existence of a variety of symbolic traditions and biologically competent speakers .
The primary objection raised in discussing this matter with linguists at the conference was the doubt that the presence of one kind of symbolic activity necessarily implies the existence of another kind , language .
The argument based on uniformitarianism was questioned as being outside of the spirit of evolution , as evolution is by its nature contrary to uniformitarianism over time .
--------Postscript----
As the conference ended I spoke to social anthropologist Chris Knight to ask his response to the D'Errico presentation .
In particular I wondered whether he believed that a society with symbolism advanced enough to produce pigmentation and body ornamentation had to have language , or , as some linguists had said to me , one could still be skeptical .
He was of the opinion that it is absolutely established now that Neanderthals spoke .

OFFICIAL ACCOUNT OF 9/11 FLIGHT CONTRADICTED BY GOVERNMENT'S OWN DATA
Pilots for 9/11 Truth , an international organization of pilots and aviation professionals , petitioned the National Transportation and Safety Board ( NTSB ) via the Freedom of Information Act to obtain their 2002 report , " Flight Path Study - American Airlines Flight 77 " , consisting of a Comma Separated Value ( CSV ) file and Flight Path Animation , allegedly derived from Flight 77's Flight Data Recorder ( FDR ) .
The data provided by the NTSB contradict the 9/11 Commission Report in several significant ways :
The NTSB Flight Path Animation approach path and altitude does not support official events .
All Altitude data shows the aircraft at least 300 feet too high to have struck the light poles .
The rate of descent data is in direct conflict with the aircraft being able to impact the light poles and be captured in the Dept of Defense " 5 Frames " video of an object traveling nearly parallel with the Pentagon lawn .
The record of data stops at least one second prior to official impact time .
If data trends are continued , the aircraft altitude would have been at least 100 feet too high to have hit the Pentagon .
In August , 2006 , members of Pilots for 9/11 Truth received these documents from the NTSB and began a close analysis of the data they contain .
After expert review and cross check , Pilots for 9/11 Truth has concluded that the information in these NTSB documents does not support , and in some instances factually contradicts , the official government position that American Airlines Flight 77 struck the Pentagon on the morning of September 11 , 2001 .
According to the 9/11 Commission Report , which relied heavily upon the NTSB Flight Path Study , American Airlines Flight 77 struck the Pentagon at 9:37:46 AM on the morning of September 11 , 2001 .
However , the reported impact time according to the NTSB Flight Path Study is 09:37:45 .
Also according to reports , American Airlines Flight 77 struck the Pentagon and by doing so , struck down 5 light poles on Highway 27 in its path to the west wall .

So ..
My 13 year old son thinks I am stressed out , and apparently he has been researching ways to help reduce that stress ..
It really started innocently enough … .
Over the weekend , while away at his fathers house , came up with a plan
— a ‘ solution ’ —
to combat my stress .
An herbal tincture , if you will .
He came home from his dads , a smile on his face , a little bottle in his hand .
I gave him a hug and welcomed him home .
All normal so far .
As normal as it gets , anyway .
Then ..
It began .
And the next 2 hours of my life was forever changed ….
My Son : “ I know how stressed you ’ve been , Mom , so I made you a laxative . ”
Me : “ A what ? ! ”
My Son : “ A laxative .. you know , so you can relax ? ”
I have the instant tightening of my tummy .. the pre-hysteria seeping in .
I try , oh , how I try to hold in the laughter .
I bite my lip , as I ask ..
Me : “ Where did you learn about ..umm.. laxatives ? ” My Son : “ Well , the other night after you went to sleep , I was reading about laxatives in that book .. that homeopathetic book .
I think you need to relax more , Mom . ”
Yup .
You guessed it .
He found a recipe in a homeopathic book for a laxative .
L - A-X- A-T-I-V-E
That is when I totally lost it .
I could n’t hold back .
It just was n’t going to happen .
Laughter had gotten me .. I was done for .
I fell off the sofa , in a fit of overwhelming giggles , tears starting to form , on my hands and knees laughing so hard I could n’t breathe at all … .
“ A laxative ” I say .. well , attempted to say .
It came out more like “ Alaxativeeeeeeeebawhahahahahahahahahahahahaha ” Me : “ Do you know what a laxative is ? ” My Son : “ Something to make you relax ? ” Me : “ Well , it makes part of you relax . ”
Of course , that last line made me die laughing again .
I tried to stand up , and ended up falling back on the sofa , my body doubled over .
Meanwhile , all I kept thinking was ..
Laxative Boy .. hurry !!
there are lives at stake .. from all the steak we ate ..
Help !!
Help !!!
The LaxMobile — a portable toilet with wheels .. does 80 MPshiiiiiit .
The LaxCave ….??
Lax -O- Grams Stress - Less Laxatives .. and on and on and on .
I finally got enough air in my lungs to take a breath , and told him ..
Me : “ A laxative is something a person takes to help them .. you know .. go to the bathroom . “
My Son : blank stare Me : “ You know .. when you ca n’t ..um .. go .
Remember last summer , when I gave you the prune juice , because you could n’t go ?
That is a kind of laxative . ”
My Son who has now turned a white shade of pale : “ Are you kidding me ?!?!
Oh my god !!
I gave a whole bottle to Grandma , and she drank all of it !. ”
He said this with a huge amount of panic in his voice , while grabbing his phone to call his Grandmother and tell her not to drink anymore of his “ relaxative ” .
( Too late — she spent the next 3 days viewing the floor tiles of her bathroom , while on her porcelain throne . )
This is when I completely lost it .
30 minutes of laughing hard .
My tummy muscles were in agony , my shoulders ached , my voice was raspy , and I was shaking all over .
I could n’t even / look / at my son without busting in to severe laughing fits .
He endured this for 2 + hours .
All the while I called him “ Laxative Boy ” .
It was days of laughter for me .
I would walk through a room , catch a glimpse of him out of the corner of my eye , and start laughing again .
It really was the best laugh I had had in / years / .
LITTLE BREWSTER ISLAND , Boston Harbor ( Reuters Life ! ) -
The sole remaining lighthouse keeper in the United States may be the last one but she is n’t about to disappear .

Sally Snowman , 56 , is part historian , part tour guide and part maintenance worker who tends Boston Light , a beacon that rises 89 feet ( 27 meter ) on its own island and had guided sailors for almost three centuries .
Her charge , and specifically the 12 - sided rotating lens that casts its beam 27 nautical miles out to sea , fills her with a great sense of security .
“ When you ’re out at night on the island , you can actually see the 12 rays , ” said the ex-schoolteacher .
“ It actually looks like the rays are going out to the curvature of the earth and it feels so protected , like nothing ’s going to harm me .
It ’s awesome . ”
The U.S. Coast Guard has automated the other 278 federally run lighthouses , finding this a more cost - effective way to manage navigational aids that have become less critical since the advent of global positioning systems that harness satellite technology .
But Boston Light , which in 1716 became the first lighthouse in the former British colonies , keeps its keeper thanks to Massachusetts Sen .
Edward Kennedy who two decades ago helped push through legislation requiring a full - time attendant .
Snowman got the job in 2003 when the Coast Guard decided it could be held by a civilian .
Now she resides on the three - acre
island for up to a week at a time .
She makes sure the lighthouse , keeper ’s cottage and other buildings are maintained , the 1,000 - watt light is lit , and the grounds are in shape for the 4,000 tourists who travel the nine nautical miles from Boston Harbor each year .

RADIATING HOPE AND SECURITY
Snowman dresses the part , wearing a bonnet and long dress to reflect how women dressed in 1783 when the Commonwealth of Massachusetts rebuilt the tower that was blown up by retreating British troops in 1776 , as the Revolutionary War got underway .
Twice a day she walks the island ’s perimeter to inspect its buildings , making sure that the light is still drawing power from an undersea cable stretching from the mainland , and that the island ’s water and communications systems work properly .
In between , she oversees a crew of about 100 volunteers who help to take weather readings and fill the hundreds of tiny holes that pock the island , thanks to a population of muskrats .
Automation is not the only change facing lighthouses .
As navigators rely on other technologies to find their way , the U.S. government has begun selling or donating to historic preservation groups lights no longer necessary for navigation .
More than 300 lights have passed into private hands this way , according to Coast Guard officials .
But for recreational boaters and small fishing vessels , which represent a sizable chunk of Boston Harbor traffic , the lights still play a role .
“ They help with approaches because they can be seen from a great distance away , ” said David Bryan , general manager of the Boston Sailing Club , which teaches sailing and navigation .
“ If the idea is that now everyone is using GPS and you do n’t need light houses , I would say that redundant information is very important when navigating . ”
Beyond its role in navigation , Boston Light is also a tourist draw .
Snowman has a theory as to why .
“ For many , it has a sense of hope and spirituality , not religion , but spirituality , ” she said in an interview atop the tower , looking out over Boston Harbor .
“ They look at it and see it as a coming home and safety . ”
Introduction
In 1846 , Dred Scott and his wife Harriet filed suit for their freedom in the St. Louis Circuit Court .
This suit began an eleven - year legal fight that ended in the U.S. Supreme Court , which issued a landmark decision declaring that the Scotts remained slaves .
This decision contributed to rising tensions between the free and slave states just before the American Civil War .
For more information on the history of the case , visit the History of Dred Scott page .
The records displayed in this exhibit document the Scotts ' early struggle to gain their freedom through litigation and are the only extant records of this significant case as it was heard in the St. Louis Circuit Court .
The original Dred Scott case file is located in the Office of the St. Louis Circuit Clerk .
This collection is an expanded and updated version of the original Dred Scott Case Collection .
The collection , was expanded from eighty - five to one hundred and eleven documents , over 400 pages of text .
In addition , the collection is now a full - text , searchable resource that represents the full case history of the Dred Scott Case .

With the weather warming , we can all get out and take a walk enjoying the beauty of nature .
While you 're walking , look for pine sap .
We get the pine sap and put it in a empty medicine container .
Get enough to fill the container .
If you ever get a sliver of glass or a thorn in your foot or hand , put sap on the area where the piece of glass or splinter is .
Sometime the area is sore and you can't see the item .
Cover with a band aid .
Keep covered each day with fresh pine pitch until it draws the little piece out .
You will know when its out as it will no longer hurt .
This really works .
I broke a glass while doing dishes and I had to do this to get a piece of glass out that was so tiny I could n't see , but it hurt .
I also used it when my children were young to remove sand spurs when we lived in Florida .
It really works , and all it costs is your time while you walk in nature .

Editor 's note : " Glenn Beck " is on CNN Headline News nightly at 7 and 9 ET and hosts a conservative national radio talk show .
Glenn
Beck says he does n't believe there are jobs Americans " just wo n't do . "
NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- " Jobs Americans just wo n't do . "
I can't stand that line , but more importantly , I do n't even understand it .
Americans spend months at a time at sea fishing for crab or drilling for oil ; two of the most dangerous jobs in the world .
Americans clean bathrooms , subway stations and crime scenes .
Americans man toll booths , pave roads , embalm bodies and inspect sewers .
Yet people really expect us to believe that they wo n't pick strawberries or oranges ?
It just does n't add up .
Earlier this week The Wall Street Journal published a story about a shortage of H - 2B visas , which are issued twice a year to nonagricultural seasonal employees .
Because our government can't get out of its own way , they recently let an important " returning workers " provision expire resulting in thousands of foreign workers being shut out of the country this summer .
That 's inexcusable .
I know this will come as a huge shock to those who only like to hurl insults , but I think we should be issuing more work visas , more student visas , and more green cards .
And I think we should cut the red tape and bureaucracy that 's constantly blocking the front door .
But until that happens people are left looking for loopholes and excuses , and " jobs Americans wo n't do " is the gold standard .
The Journal article offered an example of a couple that sells food at fairs around California each summer .
They say that because of the H - 2B visa shortage most of their seasonal employees are n't able to enter the country .
So why do n't they just hire Americans instead ?
Good question .
Her answer ?
" This is a hard job . "
I find it pretty hard to believe that there are n't a few college students who would n't want to drive around California and work outdoors all summer , but let 's assume that 's true .
Let 's even assume that none of the other 1.1 million Californians who were unemployed as of April are interested in the job either .
Is n't anyone wondering why ?
Well I 'm not a labor consultant , but I am a thinker .
Maybe the problem is n't that the job they 're offering is " too hard , " maybe it's that the wages they 're offering are " too low . "
No one paints the undersides of bridges for fun , they do it for the money .
That 's how capitalism works .
How capitalism does NOT work is when we collectively look the other way as companies exploit illegal labor for their own benefit .
The unspoken truth is that these businesses do n't hire illegal aliens because they can't find American workers , they hire illegal aliens because they do n't want American workers .
And it has nothing to do with wages .
Illegal aliens mean no workers ' comp claims , no age , race or sex discrimination lawsuits , no healthcare premiums , no unions , and no demands for raises , vacations or bigger offices .
In fact , illegal immigrants are the perfect employees because they 're not employees at all ; they 're corporate slaves .
Economist Dr. Thomas
Sowell once said , " Blacks were not enslaved because they were black , but because they were available . "
Ca n't the exact same thing be said for illegal aliens ?
They 're available and we 're allowing them to be exploited in the name of cheap groceries .
Is the price of fruit really the standard we want to live up to as a country ?
Is that really who we 've become ?
Many Americans believe that cracking down on the businesses that hire illegal aliens ( the current maximum federal fine was recently raised to a laughable $ 16,000 ) would hurt these hardworking people too much .
A bad job is better than no job , we tell ourselves .
But that 's catalogue compassion .
If you want to understand the real impact of these decisions you 've got to get off the couch and go see it for yourself .
Back in 2005 , Newsday did an investigation of the living conditions of immigrants in the New York area .
In the city of Westbury ( median income : $ 83,000 / year ) officials found twelve immigrants living in a basement flooded with sewage .
In Southampton ( median income : $ 64,000 / year ) officials found immigrants living in sheds with no plumbing or heat .
In New Cassel ( median income : $ 62,000 / year ) officials estimated there were dozens of " shift - bed houses " where immigrants literally rent mattresses for a few hours a day to catch some sleep .
Is compassion looking the other way while immigrants who come here for the dream end up living a nightmare smack dab in the middle of some of our wealthiest communities ?
Is compassion ignoring stories that reveal the truth , like the recent raid of a squalid " drop house " in Los Angeles where 57 illegal aliens were being held against their will ?
Is compassion not wanting to hear that a woman was raped in that drop house , or that many more would have been if not for the screams of their children disrupting the attackers ?
If that 's compassion , then I guess I 'm happy to be accused of having none .
The problem with the debate over illegal immigration right now is that special interests have been successful in making us think with our hearts instead of our brains .
We 've been persuaded to believe that real compassion can only be achieved by following their agenda .
But look where that 's gotten us .
And more importantly , look where that 's gotten the people they 're supposedly trying to help .
If you really want to be compassionate , then help immigrants get jobs here the right way .
Help put crippling fines on the employers who knowingly hire illegal workers , help expand and simplify the visa process , and , most importantly , help get people to start thinking with their brains again .
After all , compassion without common sense may feel good but it does n't achieve anything .
If you need proof then go out and give $ 1,000 to every homeless person who asks you for change .
I bet your heart would be full , but your wallet would soon be empty .
And all those people would probably still be homeless .

Congress Must Act Decisively To Stop Police State ‘ REAL ID ’
Georgia governor says pressure elected officials with calls , letters Americans should heed the urgings of Mark Sanford ( R ) a former House member and current governor of Georgia , who is urging Americans to prod their lawmakers into debating REAL ID , pointing out that the revolutionary , Constitution - defying legislation passed as an amendment to a major bill without hearings or debate .
REAL ID “ never saw committee debate in the House and Senate , and passed as nothing more than a rider , an attachment to a bill devoted to tsunami relief and military personnel fighting in the Middle East , ” Sanford wrote in a Washington Times commentary .
“ I hope you ’ll join me in making your voice heard for truly debating this issue , ” he said .
“ REAL ID would surreptitiously require all 50 states to change their drivers licenses to act as de facto national ID cards . . . the cost of REAL ID , and the national ID card system that would come with it , would not be borne by the federal government but handed to the states and individuals , ” Sanford wrote .
“ I find it amazing now that Washington has stacked up $ 50 trillion in debts , which amount to $ 450,000 per household , that their idea of keeping those promises rests on handing the bill to others , ” he said .
“ Our greatest homeland security is liberty , and the Founding Fathers believed our greatest threat to liberty was a central government grown too powerful , ” he said .
“ Accordingly , they set up checks on federal power by vesting
REAL ID “ falsely assumes our personal information will be safer in one spot in Washington rather than housed independently across 50 separate states , ” he wrote .
“ In the last couple of years , Washington has exposed the personal information of as many as 40 million Americans — - not to mention the presidential candidates — to potential theft . ”
To err is human , “ But if you accept the reality that mistakes do happen and that bad people do hack into spots they are n’t suppose to access , does it really make sense to put all this information into a central database ? ” he asked .
“ A host of loopholes would in many ways render this bill an inconvenience and cost to Americans — not the bad guys it is intended for , ” Sanford said .
“ These range from REAL ID having no impact in travelers with foreign passports to the recent affirmation by the federal government that no form of ID is needed to board a plane .
In short , there are many faults in this bill that could be sorted were there debate in Washington on REAL ID . ” ( Issue # 17 , April 28 , 2008 )
Java が使いにくい言語であるというのは、世界中の
LL ファンが皆思っていることだろうから改めていうことでもないけど、使いにくいのは静的言語だからというのは間違っている。Java が使いにくいのは単に Java の設計者のセンスが悪かっただけであり、静的言語のせいではない。
たとえばこんなコード。
public Map < String , List < String >> example ( ) { List < String > list = new ArrayList < String >( ) ; list.add ( " foo " ) ; list.add ( " bar " ) ; list.add ( " baz " ) ; Map < String , List < String >> map = new HashMap < String , List < String >>( ) ; map.put ( " names " , list ) ; return map ; }
まあなんといいますか 。Map や
List を表すリテラルがないせいで、記述が冗長になってしかたない。どうせ
List と Map の 99 パーセントは ArrayList と HashMap なんだから、もうそろそろリテラルを用意してもいいと思う。型指定のせいでリテラルが難しいのであれば、「 new ArrayList { " foo " , " bar " , " baz " } ; 」のような記述を用意するだけでもずいぶん違う。
（追記(2008-03-07 ) ：「リテラル」という言葉に過剰に反応している人もいるが、ここでの趣旨は「本質的ではない記述を減らして
Java を使いやすくする」ということなので、ライブラリで済むのであればそれで結構
( コメントを参照のこと)。また『リテラルを用意してもいいと思う』『リテラルが難しいのであれば』と書いたように、絶対にリテラルを導入すべきだという主張ではない。あくまで、Java を使いやすくするための方法のひとつとして提案したまでであり、他の方法を否定してはいない。趣旨を勘違いしないでいただきたい。）
また や > が 1 行に 2 回出てくるのがうっとうしい。List#add( ) や List#put ( ) は戻り値が void だが、これは return this とするべき ( StringBuffer#append ( ) はそうなっているのにね)。せめてこう書けるようにしてほしかった。
public Map < String , List < String >> example ( ) { var list = new ArrayList < String >( ) ; list.add ( " foo " ) .add ( " bar " ) .add ( " baz " ) ; var map = new HashMap < String , List < String > > ( ) ; map.put ( " names " , list ) ; return map ; }
「 var」という予約語が増やしているから互換性が問題になるけど、assert と同じでコンパイルオプションで on / off すればいいだろう。
あと、アクセッサね。いちいち getter と setter を定義しなきゃいけないのがバカバカしい。よく 「 IDE で自動生成すれば問題ない」という人がいるけど、そんなのが必要な時点で間違ってるとは思わないのだろうか。だいたい、本質的でないコードが何十行もある時点で、ソースコードの readability が下がってしまう。あんなもの、コード行数を水増しするための仕様だ。
世の Java 屋はこのコードを見ても、何も疑問に感じないそうだ。ありえん。
private int id ; private String name ; private Date updated ; public int getId ( ) { return this .id ; } public void setId ( int id ) { this .id = id ; } public String getName ( ) { return this .name ; } public void setName ( String name ) { this .
name = name ; } public Date getUpdated ( ) { return this .date ; } public void setUpdate ( Date date ) { this .date = date ; }
これが次のように簡単になったら、なにか問題でもあるのだろうか。こっちのほうが書くのも簡単だし、なにより本質的でないコードがなくなるためたいへん読みやすい。
@accessor private int id ; @accessor private String name ; @accessor private Date updated ;
こういった Java の使いにくさは、静的言語であることとは関係がない。Java の言語設計者は、仕様をコンパクトにすることには注意を払っていたけど ( それも 1.5 で覆った が ) 、使いやすさについてはあまり関心がなかったようだ。というか、Java に限らず Struts とか EJB とか見る限り 、SUN や IBM には使いやすさに関するセンスがない。使いやすい product はほとんどが個人で作っ た OSS だ。
Things did not go well with HaskellDB when I ran my query across a large data set .
MySQL as a query optimizer , sucked .
Postgres seems to be doing better .
I started with a mysql database containing 11 years of day data from the ASX .
This includes the closing price ( and some other info ) of all stocks traded on the Australian Stock Exchange ( ASX ) since 1997 .
The tables are organized with unique keys and , based on some testing , include appropriate indexes .
Things still ran slowly .
I tried tuning mysql .
Then , based on the slow queries logged , tried running them by hand to see if I was missing any indexes .
No such luck .
The query just did n’t perform .
I simplified the query and ran it again ( see below ) .
Now it ran fast , but does n’t help with the generated query .
Looks like MySQL ’s optimizer does n’t optimize enough .
MySQL timing :
Query 1 : 6.25s ( anywhere from 24s - 6s )
( anywhere from 24s - 6s ) Query 2 : 0.15s
Next step .
Install Postgres .
Postgres timing :
Query 1 : 0.03s
Query 2 : 0.03s
To avoid the cache impacting the results , both servers were stopped and re-started between each query run .
With caching , Postgres gets down to 0.2s .
MySQL will still have 6s /0.3s .
Tests were run on a MacBook with 2 Gb of memory .
Both queries were run with the command line tool of the respective database engines , mysql and psql .
The end_of_day table has 4,749,025 records and the stock table has 25,863 records .
Query 1 – HaskellDB generated
SELECT closing_price2 as closing_price , trade_date2 as trade_date FROM ( SELECT stock_id as stock_id2 , trade_date as trade_date2 , closing_price as closing_price2 FROM end_of_day as T1 ) as T1 , ( SELECT stock_id as stock_id1 , ticker as ticker1 FROM stock as T1 ) as T2 WHERE stock_id1 = stock_id2 AND ticker1 IN ( ' FXJ ' , ' NWS ' , ' WAN ' ) AND trade_date2 = ' 2008-02-14 00:00:00 ' ;
Query 2 – Hand written
SELECT e . closing_price as closing_price , e . trade_date as trade_date FROM stock s , end_of_day e WHERE s .
stock_id = e . stock_id AND s . ticker IN ( ' FXJ ' , ' NWS ' , ' WAN ' ) AND e .
trade_date = ' 2008-02-14 00:00:00 ' ;
So do n’t use HaskellDB and MySQL if you are doing joins across large tables .
Use Postgres instead .
The Haskell query :
By Martin Bosworth
Awhile back I was introduced to the concept of the “ five supernatural perceptions ” or “ superknowledges , ” achieved by bodhisattvas as a pinnacle of achievement in meditation and understanding in Buddhism .
I had cause to reflect on this recently while reading George Soros ’ 2006 book , “ The Age of Fallibility . ”
If it seems odd to connect a famous financier and philanthropist with mystical powers gained through enlightenment and transcendence , do n’t worry –it is odd .
But there ’s a common key that I found , and that is the key of flexibility in philosophy .
Soros devotes the book to exploring and questioning the larger philosophical frames that enabled America to buy into such absurd concepts as “ The War on Terror ” without any questioning , breaking it down using his oft - discussed “ theory of reflexivity , ” the essence of which I ’ll quote here :
And that is the starting point of my theory , the theory of reflexivity , which holds that our thinking is inherently biased .
Thinking participants cannot act on the basis of knowledge .
Knowledge presupposes facts which occur independently of the statements which refer to them ; but being a participant implies that oneâ€™s decisions influence the outcome .
Therefore , the situation participants have to deal with does not consist of facts independently given but facts which will be shaped by the decision of the participants .
There is an active relationship between thinking and reality , as well as the passive one which is the only one recognized by natural science and , by way of a false analogy , also by economic theory .
I call the passive relationship the â€œcognitive functionâ€  and the active relationship the â€œparticipating function , â€ and the interaction between the two functions I call â€œreflexivity .
â€
Reflexivity is , in effect , a two - way feedback mechanism in which reality helps shape the participantsâ€™ thinking and the participantsâ€ ™ thinking helps shape reality in an unending process in which thinking and reality may come to approach each other but can never become identical .
Knowledge implies a correspondence between statements and facts , thoughts and reality , which is not possible in this situation .
The key element is the lack of correspondence , the inherent divergence , between the participantsâ€™ views and the actual state of affairs .
It is this divergence , which I have called the â€œparticipantâ€™s bias , â€ which provides the clue to understanding the course of events .
That , in very general terms , is the gist of my theory of reflexivity .
Soros largely applies this theory to the ebbs and flows of the financial markets , using a reformulation of what is , essentially , the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle –that the act of observing changes the conditions of that which is observed , or sometimes even failing to observe can make the same changes .
Put in even simpler terms , it ’s impossible to look at anything with an unbiased view , because we all have biases and bends to our observations , inculcated by culture , personal foibles , and social interactions .
That ’s why simplicity is equated to looking at the world through the eyes of a child –because only a child ’s mind is free from the weight and burdens of years of accumulated experience , and can see things with a clarity we complex adults lack .
You can see Soros ’ observations play out in the collapse of the housing market and how it has rippled into a larger economic malaise ( succinctly summed up here by Gavin ) .
People bought into the myth of the bubble because they wanted to be rich , because they wanted to escape the risk , because they thought , somehow , that the consequences would n’t touch them .
And indeed , some people were smart or lucky enough to get out right at the peak and enjoy the rewards of timing .
But many others were not .
Were the “ winners ” smarter or inherently better than the “ losers ? ”
Of course not–neither group had perfect knowledge , but one group simply made better decisions with the information they had .
Soros said in his book that in order to achieve a model of a truly open society , America has to undergo a deeper philosophical and sociological transformation than simply getting rid of Bush and the Republican neocon machine , although that would certainly be a good start .
I ’ll let him elaborate :
My contention is that America has become a â€œfeel - goodâ€ society unwilling to face unpleasant reality .
That is why the public could be so grievously misled by the Bush administration .
Unless this feel - good attitude can be changed , the United States is doomed to lose its dominant position in the world .
There will be serious adverse consequences not only for America but also for the world …
I contend that our understanding of reality is inherently imperfect and all human constructs are flawed in one way or another .
Open societies recognize our fallibility , closed societies deny it .
America is an open society , but people are not well versed in philosophy and they do not fully understand the principles of open society .
That is how they came to be misled .
You can see this fundamental flaw in so many aspects of our culture and view of the world –everything from the almost terminal inability to keep up with concepts for more than a few seconds before tossing them aside out of boredom .
The cynical passive - aggressiveness that drives people into mewling despair or undirected anger the moment life does n’t go exactly the way they want it to .
The aversion of responsibility when things go wrong ( “ XYZ Big Corporation agreed to a settlement without admitting any wrongdoing ” ) while soaking up the privilege of success .
The constant trilling whine of a need for certainty , for stability , direction , and purpose .
The overwhelming disgust with the media machine for not reporting the issues exactly the way we want them to be said .
The reality is that we have to recognize that the only way to understand something perfectly is to first admit that our understanding is flawed .
Everyone approaches , reports , writes , and shapes something according to the conditions we bring to the table .
We ’ve been taught to enshrine Reason as this distinct plane of existence apart from our own imperfect minds –that our own rationality is perfect and everyone else is bugfuck nuts .
This , of course , contributes to the continual breakdown of debate and idea - sharing into angry words and flamewars –because we have to be right , so the other guy ca n’t possibly be right .
Let me tie this back to an eloquent summation of how Buddhist principles can help build an open society :
Buddhism teaches awareness and acceptance of change .
Change is a fundamental reality of our conditioned existence .
The concept of not - self also has a profound lessons for all of us .
Our Western understandings of self often keep us from living in right relationship with each other and with our environment .
When we understand ourselves to be distinct , static selves , we keep ourselves from the awareness of how radically interconnected we are .
We literally constitute each other .
Our intentions , and not just our actions , have an impact upon everyone and everything around us .
It is our responsibility to change them through a difficult process of change .
There is a difference between being interconnected and taking other into oneâ€™s own ego .
With strong ego , and a sense of ourselves as separate , we tend to relate to other people as if we are taking them into are own ego .
We perceive them through our own preconceptions and we are not able to perceive them as they are .
An awareness of interconnectedness leads to unconditional love and compassion , rather than a conditional love born out of the needs of a ravenous ego .
In order to achieve a truly open society , we have to overcome the distinctly ( but not uniquely ) American tradition of worship of individiualism as the cult of self , the be - all / end - all of existence .
The odds are n’t particularly good that we will achieve perfect knowledge , but to coin a phrase , the journey matters more than the destination .
The glory of perfect understanding may or may not lead to the ability to perform miracles , but it can lead us to a more harmonious state of existence that recognizes individuality while urging understanding of others ’ views , cultures , beliefs , and the shared connections that bind us all .
If you think you ’ve seen it all , just wait for Ragnarok , the end of times foreseen by the ancient Vikings .
In it , the world turns into a vast , smoking battlefield .
Featuring a wolf with a mouth as big as the sky , a giant with a burning sword and ... a kind tree .
But who knows , one of these days , the REAL Ragnarok might unfold .
Ragnarok means ‘ fate of the gods ’ .
It is the Viking version of the Apocalypse .
Believe us : you do n’t want to be around when it happens .
It all starts with a winter that just wo n’t stop .
For three years in a row , summer does n’t come .
All there is , is this harsh , terrible winter .
It is freezing cold , so you stay indoors , and get bad - tempered .
As a consequence , all kinds of arguments break out among men , even within the closest families .
Morality and mutual respect seem to break down .
In case you ’re interested : what you ’re witnessing is the ‘ Fimbulwinter ’ , the first clear sign the world is about to end .
Now , brace yourself .
You ’re going to witness the first in a series of HUGE apocalyptic surprises .
For what on Earth is that ?
Suddenly , you see a huge wolf flying overhead .
It flies across the sky , like some weird kind of airplane .
That , my friend , is the mythical wolf Skoll .
And before you know what ’s happening , it eats up the Sun .
And wait -- there goes the moon , too !
From that moment on , it gets crazier and crazier .
The ground starts to shudder .
Trees are launched , even complete mountains fall over .
And then , suddenly , you see this outlandishly dressed guy emerging out of nowhere .
It is Loki , supreme bad guy for the Vikings .
He is set free by the earthquakes -- and ready to pick a fight .
Loki is not alone .
Next to him , you see another supernatural wolf .
It ’s Loki ’s son , Fenrir .
The beast has a HUGE mouth : its lower jaw scrapes the ground , while the upper jaw touches the sky .
Right after that , you hear a sharp , screeching sound .
Could that be… a cock crowing ?
Yes : it is .
In fact , there are three of them .
Cock number one , a red animal , crows to the giants .
Cock number two , a golden bird , calls in the gods .
And cock number three , a rusty brown animal , raises the dead from hell .
You rub your eyes .
This ca n’t be happening , you keep telling yourself .
But it is .
Next thing you know , the sea starts to roar violently .
There ’s a colossal tsunami , and then , the next bad guy enters the stage .
A gargantuan serpent rises out of the sea .
It is Jormungand , a venomous snake out of hell .
From that moment on , things go from bad to worse .
Everywhere around the globe , all kinds of gods and beasts and demons and giants start showing up .
Some come in ships , others on horseback , still others come walking .
They ’re all heavily armed , with divine swords , magical spears , and all kinds of other supernatural stuff .
And they seem to be in a bad mood .
Now , if you happen to live in Norway , better take shelter .
For Norway is where all these weird creatures are heading .
That ’s where the final battle is to be fought , on a battlefield called Vigrid .
In total amazement , you watch on TV what ’s unfolding .
From the east comes the huge sailing ship Naglfar , commanded by the giant Hymir .
Look , there comes Loki again , aboard another huge boat , full of demons he brought in from hell .
From the south comes
Surt , another sinister warrior leading an army of giants .
Do n’t try to talk him out of it : he ’ll instantly incinerate you with his mighty sword , which is as hot as the Sun itself .
Carelessly , Surt turns every city he passes into a smoking rubble .
And there ’s more to come .
In the south , people witness how a fierce hell hound named Garm rushes in to team up with the fire giants .
In the meantime , you wo n’t be able get a night ’s rest : the pitch - black sky is filled with eerie woes , explosions and echoes .
Why do these apocalypses always come with all of these special effects ?
On the battlefield , one lonely god hangs around .
It ’s the good Viking god named Heimdall .
And when he sees all these giants and demons and beasts approaching , he picks up his horn and blows it , to wake up the gods .
It will be some sound : it is heard throughout the entire world .
So : the gods wake up .
There ’s Odin , and Thor , and all the others .
What do they do ?
Well : they sit down , have a few drinks and have a meeting .
Yggdrasil , the Tree of the World
On Earth , we will of course not notice this .
What we do notice , is another weird apocalyptic event .
You may not know this , but somewhere in heaven , there ’s a very special tree called Yggdrasil .
It is the Tree of the World , the living embodiment of everything and everyone that ever was and ever will be on this planet .
And now , Yggdrasil shivers .
From its deepest root up to its highest branches , it shakes .
You should feel this shaking from deep within : it is your very existence itself , that shivers .
Everything on Earth and in heaven and hell will quiver , the Viking legends foresee .
Meanwhile , the gods finally arrive at the battlefield .
They look exactly as you would expect them to : dressed in shiny , golden armor , and riding beautiful white horses .
The upper god Odin rides at the head .
Then , it ’s battle time .
It goes something like this :
Odin jumps Fenrir , while Thor is attacked by Jormungand and Freyr clashes with Surt , but unfortunately Freyr gave his sword to Skirnir , so Surt wins , while Tyr kills Garm but then dies himself , just like Heimdall and Loki fight each other to death and Thor dies after killing Jormungand with his hammer Mjollnir , while Odin is eaten by Fenrir , after which Vidar gets so pissed off he kills Fenrir by tearing off its head , which annoys
Surt so much he sets the entire world on fire , killing everyone else .
And after that , all land sinks into the sea .
Finally , it gets quiet .
So , exit mankind ?
And bye - bye gods ?
Not quite .
Miraculously , a few gods survive .
And fortunately , they belong to the good guys : Odin ’s brother and sons Vili , Vali and Vidar , Thor ’s sons Magni and Modi and a few other blokes , named Honir , Balder and Hod .
Even more miraculously , two people survive .
They ’re named Lif and Lifthrasir -- the Viking version of Adam and Eve , so to say .
They have endured the events by hiding deep within the tree Yggdrasil .
And it gets better .
After a while , up rises an entire new world from the sea .
It ’s a heavenly place , with lush fields and plenty of corn waiting to be harvested .
The Sun is reborn , and so is the moon .
Balder takes it on him to lead the gods of this new world , and Lif and Lifthrasir worship Balder and his gods .
Slowly , the world is repopulated by the descendents of Lif and Lifthrasir .
Fortunately for them , World No. 2 is a much better place than our current world ever was .
For one thing , evil no longer exists .
There will be no sword - fighting , no nit-picking , gossiping , cheating , stealing , killing or breaking the speed limit with your car .
Finally , mankind will live in complete and utter harmony .
It ’s a pity you wo n’t be there to join in .
According to the ancient Viking writings called the Edda , which describe all these events , you will have died in the fire unleashed by Surt .
Or , if you somehow managed to survive that , you would have drowned in the big sinking of all land afterwards .
But even then , your soul still exists .
By now , you should find yourself in the renewed , totally reconstructed Viking heaven .
There are many rooms there , and their quality varies wildly .
If you ’re very lucky , you get to live with the gods in a place called Gimli , which is a huge , sunlit building with a golden roof .
Or you might find yourself in Brimir , another beautiful place with drinks galore .
But on the other hand , if you behaved badly during life , you could end up in a dark hole called Nastrond .
That means ‘ corpse strand ’ , a description that pretty much says it all .
Nastrond is a dark dungeon , with walls and roofs made of snakes .
You will have to wade through a river of venom for eternity .
No offense to the Vikings , but somehow we at Exit Mundi have some doubts about the reality of Ragnarok .
It seems to be just what it is : a Viking myth .
Not too many people believe in it anymore -- if there are any people who still take it literally , that is .
On the other hand , plenty of modern day people seriously accept the idea that one day , the world will be terminated by four horsemen and a horde of huge locusts from a pit .
That , at least , is how it goes in the Christian end of times , the Apocalypse of St. John .

The skulls were made with tools not available to Pre-Columbian cultures
Two of the best known crystal skulls - artefacts once thought to be the work of ancient American civilisations - are modern fakes , a scientific study shows .
Crystal skulls are the focus of the story in the latest Indiana Jones film .
But experts say examples held at the British Museum in London and the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC are anything but genuine .
Their results show the skulls were made using tools not available to the ancient Aztecs or Mayans .
Researchers say the work , which is published in the Journal of Archaeological Science , should end decades of speculation over the origins of these controversial objects .
And it casts serious doubt over the authenticity of other crystal skulls held in collections around the world .
A team including Margaret Sax , from the British Museum in London , and Professor Ian Freestone , from Cardiff University , used sophisticated techniques to work out how the two skulls had been made .
There seems to be the assumption that if it is roughly worked , it is more likely to have been made by a traditional society .
That 's untrue of course
Prof Ian Freestone , Cardiff University
" There are about a dozen or more of these crystal skulls .
Except for the British Museum skull and one in Paris , they seem to have entered public awareness since the 60s , with the interest in quartz and the New Age movement , " Professor Freestone told BBC News .
" It does appear that people have been making them since then .
Some of them are quite good , but some of them look like they were produced with a Black & Decker in someone 's garage . "
He added : " There seems to be the assumption that if it is roughly worked , it is more likely to have been made by a traditional society .
That 's untrue of course , because people were quite sophisticated .
They might not have had modern tools , but they did a good job . "
The researchers used an electron microscope to show that the skulls were probably shaped using a spinning disc - shaped tool made from copper or another suitable metal .
The craftsman added an abrasive to the wheel , allowing the crystal to be worked more easily .
Modern technology
This " rotary wheel " technology was almost certainly not used by pre-Columbian peoples .
Instead , analysis of genuine Aztec and Mixtec artefacts show they were crafted using tools made from stone and wood .
The British Museum skull was worked with a harsh abrasive such as corundum or diamond .
But X - ray diffraction analysis showed a different material , called carborundum , was used on the artefact in the Smithsonian .
Carborundum is a synthetic abrasive which only came into use in the 20th Century : " The suggestion is that it was made in the 1950s or later , " said Professor Freestone .
Who made the skulls is still a mystery .
But , in the case of the British Museum object , some point the finger of suspicion at a 19th Century French antiquities dealer called Eugene Boban .
" We assume that he bought it from , or had it made from [ craftsmen ] somewhere in Europe , " said Professor Freestone , a former deputy keeper of science and conservation at the British Museum .
Anonymous donation Contemporary documents suggest Mr Boban was involved in selling at least two of the known crystal skulls - the one held in London and another in Paris .
The London skull was probably manufactured no more than a decade before being offered up for sale .
Despite the findings , a spokeswoman for the British Museum said the artefact would remain on permanent display to the public .
The skull held by the Smithsonian was donated to the museum anonymously in 1992 , along with a note saying it had been bought in Mexico in 1960 .
Nothing is known of its history before that date , but like the British object , it was probably manufactured shortly before being purchased .
The researchers were not able to determine where the quartz used in the skulls was quarried .
But locations with suitably large deposits include Brazil , Madagascar and , possibly , the Alps .
Professor Freestone said the work did not prove all crystal skulls were fakes , but it did cast doubt on the authenticity of other examples : " None of them have a good archaeological provenance and most appeared suspiciously in the last decades of the 20th Century .
So we have to be sceptical , " he explained .
The findings are likely to be a disappointment to enthusiasts and collectors ; the skulls have become a part of popular culture , appearing in numerous films and novels .

With oil and natural gas prices rising and coal prices still relatively low , the return of the US to a greater reliance on coal might seem inevitable .
However , several recent reports suggest that coal reserves , which have shrunk dramatically during the past century , may still be overstated .
Coal prices are likely to rise precipitously during the next two decades due to transport bottlenecks and higher transport costs , falling production trends in many current producing regions , and the lack of suitable new coalfields .
This information should give pause to any agency planning new coal power plants today .
Because the US has the world ’s largest coal reserves , it has sometimes been called " the Saudi Arabia of coal . "
It is the world ’s second - largest coal producer , after China , but surpasses both the number three and four producer nations ( India and Australia ) by nearly a factor of three .
Wood was this nation ’s primary fuel until the mid-1880s , when deforestation necessitated greater reliance on abundant coal resources .
Coal then remained America ’s main energy source until the 1930s , when it was overtaken by oil .
Today coal fuels about 50 percent of US electricity production and provides about a quarter of the country ’s total energy .
The US currently produces over a billion tons of coal per year , with quantities increasing annually .
This is well over double the amount produced in 1960 .
However , due to a decline in the average amount of energy contained in each ton of coal produced ( i.e. , declining resource quality ) , the total amount of energy flowing into the US economy from coal is now falling , having peaked in 1998 .
This decline in energy content per unit of weight ( also known as " heating value " ) amounts to more than 30 percent since 1955 .
It can partly be explained by the depletion of anthracite reserves and the nation ’s increasing reliance on sub- bituminous coal and even lignite , a trend that began in the 1970s .
But resource quality is declining even within each coal class .
While there are coal resources in many states , the main concentrations are in Appalachia , Illinois , Wyoming , and Montana ( see map below ) .
The 53 largest coalmines in the US , located in just a few states , account for almost 60 percent of total production .
Three states ( Pennsylvania , Kentucky , and West Virginia ) produce 52 percent of the higher - quality coal in the US .
All three of these states seem to be in decline or plateau .
Since the Northeast was the area of the nation earliest settled and was long a primary center for industrial manufacture , it is not surprising that the coal of this region was exploited preferentially .
Today , Pennsylvania ’s anthracite is almost gone .
Mining companies there are now exploiting seams as thin as 28 inches .
West Virginia , the second largest coal - producing state ( after Wyoming ) , where much coal is surface mined in an environmentally ruinous practice known as mountaintop removal , is nearing its maximum production rate and will see declines commence within the next few years , according to a recent USGS report .
( www.byronwine.com/files/coal.pdf)
The interior region — consisting of Illinois , Arkansas , Indiana , Kansas , Western Kentucky , Louisiana , Mississippi , Missouri , Oklahoma , and Texas — is the smallest coal producer of the three main producing regions .
The Illinois basin boasts large reserves of bituminous coal , but production has fallen there since the mid-1990s .
Its coal generally has a high sulfur content ( 3 to 7 percent ) , which runs afoul of US environmental laws , especially the Clean Air Act of 1990 .
Prior to this legislation , power plants burning high - sulfur coal released emissions resulting in acid rain that decimated forests throughout much of the nation .
The lignite steam coal of Louisiana is an exception within the region : its sulfur content is low and so production has risen substantially in recent years .
After 2018 , sulfur scrubbers will be mandatory for coal - fired power plants in the US , perhaps facilitating a move to increase production of coal from the Illinois Basin .
Wyoming has some bituminous coal , but most of its reserves consist of sub- bituminous and lignite .
Production from the state ( primarily from the Powder River Basin ) has increased sharply since 1970 , because its coal is abundant , cheaply surface - mined , and low in sulfur .
Wyoming is currently responsible for 80 percent of coal production west of the Mississippi .
Montana also has large deposits of lower - quality coal ( sub- bituminous and lignite ) , but these have not been tapped .
The current state governor , Brian Schweitzer , is pushing for development of these resources using gasification and carbon sequestration technologies , but there are reasons to doubt whether this will occur soon or on a meaningful scale .
Montana ’s coal contains salts that will almost inevitably find their way into the environment if widespread surface mining occurs , contaminating rivers and creating problems for cattle ranching — the state ’s economic engine and a locus of considerable political clout .
For the nation as a whole , future supply hinges on the question of how long rising production of lower - quality coal from Wyoming — supplemented in the future perhaps by coal from Montana and the Illinois Basin — can continue to compensate for declining amounts of high - quality coal from the East .
Clearly , the US has the potential to produce enormous quantities of coal .
But the gradual depletion of coal with higher heating value is already necessitating the mining of larger quantities of lower - quality coal to yield an equivalent amount of energy , and as coal is sourced more from Montana and the Illinois this will require the building of more rail transport infrastructure and the overcoming of environmental problems and regulatory hurdles .
Over sixty percent of coal mined in the US is dug from the surface .
This is a higher percentage than in most nations , and it is largely due to the contribution of Wyoming .
In the eastern states , most coal still comes from deep mines , which are moving toward the recovery of ever - thinner seams .
Highwall mining systems and new technologies for longwall mining may lead , ultimately , to remote - control mining involving few or no personnel working underground .
These new and more efficient technologies will enable some coal to be mined that would otherwise be left behind , but they are unlikely to be applied throughout the entire industry due to high up - front investment costs .
In surface mining , the largest extraction cost is often incurred in removing overburden ( soil and rock ) .
Over the years , the coal industry has introduced ever - larger earth - moving machines for this purpose .
However , truck size has probably reached a practical maximum , as the biggest vehicles cannot be maneuvered on roads .
However coal is mined , the industry must always confront the bottom line : the cost of getting coal out of the ground cannot exceed the market price for produced coal .
Thus the current price determines whether marginal coals will be mined profitably , or simply left in the ground .
On the other hand , however , as the costs of bringing coal to market rise , this can cause the price of coal to increase — unless and until higher prices suppress demand .
Given that demand for electricity continues to expand , and that cheap alternatives to coal for power generation do not exist in sufficient quantity in the short run , there seems to be no near - term cap to coal prices .
As a result , marginal coalfields are now more likely to be mined .
During the two - year period from January 2006 to January 2008 , prices rose from about $ 100 a ton to $ 250 a ton for high - quality metallurgical grades of US coal .
Central Appalachian steam coal is currently selling for about $ 90 a ton , up from $ 40 two years ago .
During this time production costs have risen as well , though not at the same pace .
The cost of producing coal is related to the price of oil .
Consider the case of Massey Energy Company , the nation ’s fourth - largest coal company , which annually produces 40 million tons of coal using about 40 million gallons of diesel fuel — about a gallon per ton ( the company also uses lubricants , rubber products , and explosives , all made from petroleum or natural gas ) .
If the price of diesel goes up one dollar , this translates directly to $ 40 million in increased costs ; indirectly related costs also climb .
These costs and prices need to be seen in proportion : while coal generates half of America ’s electricity , in effect providing much of the essential basis for all economic activity within the country , US coal industry revenues are only about $ 25 billion — one - tenth those of WalMart .
During some recent years , the US was a net coal importer , since coal brought by ship from South America was often cheaper to supply to coastal cities than US coal moved there by rail .
This was partly a result of rail transport bottlenecks that are now being addressed with the laying of more rails and the construction of more coal cars .
Now , however , with coal prices high and imports growing in China and India , the US has begun exporting larger quantities .
Mines are employing more workers and production is booming .
History of Reserves Estimates
The US has seen a long controversy between coal resource optimists and pessimists — a controversy that is somewhat mirrored in the global coal resource picture .
In 1907 , Marius R. Campbell , Director of the USGS , headed the first attempt at a scientific survey of US coal , concluding that ultimately recoverable reserves amounted to 3157.2 billion tons .
Since production in that year was 570 million tons , simple arithmetic yielded an R/ P ratio of 5500 / 1 , which was interpreted as meaning that the nation had a 5,500 - year supply .
That implied an effectively limitless amount for the practical purposes of economic planning .
Campbell did hedge his estimate by pointing out that much of this coal was not minable , or was inaccessible for other reasons .
He also wrote that " . . . the bulk of coal being mined today is the best in the country , and before long , perhaps before 50 years [ i.e. , by 1959 ] , much of the high - rank coals will be exhausted . "
( Putnam 234 ) Still , Campbell ’s figure for total reserves was for many years taken at face value .
Soon , state surveys began gathering more detailed and accurate information , which resulted in the downgrading of regional reserves .
Thus when the US Coal Commission mounted a new survey in 1923 , it reduced all state reserves figures and dropped some states entirely from its list of active or likely coal producers .
Yet through the early decades of the 20th century , the USGS and the Bureau of Mines stuck to the position that America would have plenty of coal for several millennia .
Shortly after World War II , Andrew B. Crichton ( a coal engineer and mine operator in Johnstown , Pennsylvania ) undertook a state - by - state informal review of existing reserves estimates , publishing his results in an article titled " How Much Coal Do We Really Have ?
The Need for an Up - To - Date Survey , " in Coal Technology ( August 1948 ) .
Crichton minced no words :
It was asserted at the Denver [ USGS ] meeting last October that no one should have the temerity to question the Government figures unless they submitted maps and records proving their statements .
Well , that is quite a burden to impose upon an individual to justify an opinion regarding our coal reserves .
But that is exactly what could be done in many cases in the east where many have knowledge of the wide discrepancy between the Government figures and private records based on prospecting and actual development .
It is these wide differences that prompt the fears and lead to the belief that these fantastic and unbelievable figures of the United States Geological Survey are wrong and dangerously misleading and should be corrected promptly .
Citing instance after instance in which USGS reserves figures for well - mined regions had turned out to be highly inflated , Crichton went on to offer his own estimate of national coal reserves as 223 billion tons — a number not that much smaller than the current official estimate .
Crichton ’s article , while causing understandable consternation and embarrassment for the USGS , could not be ignored .
It was cited repeatedly in Palmer Putnam ’s authoritative book Energy In the Future ( 1953 ) , which also offered pessimistic assessments of US oil and natural gas supplies .
Indeed , Putnam demonstrably erred on the conservative side , forecasting that America ’s oil production would peak between 1955 and 1960 ( the actual peak was in 1970 ) ; and that coal production would begin to decline by 1990 — whereas , as we have seen , actual produced amounts continue to grow annually .
The USGS and the Bureau of Mines , which was later absorbed into the Department of Energy , responded by gradually reducing estimates of coal reserves figures for many states and the nation as a whole .
Yet through the 1950s , national reserves remained at well over 500 billion tons — still above 1,000 years in terms of R/P forecasting .
In the 1960s , concerned that reserves figures were not making sufficient allowances for factors that would prevent much of the resource from ever being produced , the USGS commissioned surveys by geologist Paul Averitt , culminating in the publication , in 1975 , of Coal Resources of the US .
By now the official estimate of recoverable reserves had been whittled down to the current range of 260 to 275 billion tons .
This was seen as no cause for alarm , as the reserves - to - production ratio forecast remained at comfortably above 200 years ; also , it was believed that new technologies ( such as longwall mining and underground gasification ) would eventually be able to convert substantial quantities of resources back into reserves .
In 1995 , the USGS began work on the National Coal Resource Assessment ( NCRA ) , a multi - year effort to create a digital assessment on a region - by - region basis , which is still in process , with few of the crucial results currently publicly available .
According to the EIA website , as of January 1 , 2007 the Estimated Recoverable Reserves for the US amounted to 267 billion tons .
Since production for 2006 was 1,162,750 tons , that would indicate an R/P ratio of about 230/1 .
A graphic from the Department of Energy ( EIA ) , using 2005 data , is helpful in visualizing the various categories within the overall coal resource base .
As we are about to see , the long process of revising national coal reserves figures downward may not be at an end .
New Studies
1. Coal : Research and Development to Support National Energy Policy ( National Academy of Sciences [ NAS ] , July 2007 , http://books.nap.edu/).
This book - length report concluded that " there is no question that sufficient minable coal is available to meet the nation ’s coal needs through 2030 , " and also that " there is probably sufficient coal to meet the nation ’s needs for more than 100 years at current production levels " — though this latter judgment does not appear to be based on a peaking analysis .
In sum , however , the report is a plea for better , more realistic reserves estimates :
[ I]t is not possible to confirm that there is a sufficient supply of coal for the next 250 years , as is often asserted .
A combination of increased rates of production with more detailed reserve analyses that take into account location , quality , recoverability , and transportation issues may substantially reduce the estimated number of years supply .
This increasing uncertainty associated with the longer - term projections arises because significant information is incomplete or unreliable .
The data that are publicly available for such projections are outdated , fragmentary , or inaccurate .
These doubts about current reserves figures were based upon recent Coal Recoverability Studies undertaken in Kentucky , Illinois , Pennsylvania , and Wyoming — in effect , spot checks to determine whether reserves figures were indeed reliable within restricted areas where coal recoverability could be determined with some accuracy as the result of mining experience .
A total of 65 areas in 22 coal fields have been analyzed , and these studies suggest that 8 to 89 percent of the identified resources in these coal fields are recoverable and 5 to 25 percent of identified resources may be classified as reserves .
Because they are based on site - specific criteria , these studies provide considerably improved estimates compared to the ERR [ Estimated Recoverable Reserves ] .
One such study , of the Matewan quadrangle of eastern Kentucky , concluded : " a strong argument can be made that traditional coal producing regions may soon be experiencing resource depletion problems far greater and much sooner than previously thought . "

The NAS report enumerates the problems that the US coal industry will face in coming decades :
Almost certainly , coals mined in the future will be lower quality because current mining practices result in higher - quality coal being mined first , leaving behind lower - quality material ( e.g. , with higher ash yield , higher sulfur , and / or higher concentrations of potentially harmful elements ) .
The consequences of relying on poorer - quality coal for the future include ( 1 ) higher mining costs ( e.g. , the need for increased tonnage to generate an equivalent amount of energy , greater abrasion of mining equipment ) ; ( 2 ) transportation challenges ( e.g. , the need to transport increased tonnage for an equivalent amount of energy ) ; ( 3 ) beneficiation challenges ( e.g. , the need to reduce ash yield to acceptable levels , the creation of more waste ) ; ( 4 ) pollution control challenges ( e.g. , capturing higher concentrations of particulates , sulfur , and trace elements ; dealing with increased waste disposal ) ; and ( 5 ) environmental and health challenges .
2. Coal : Resources and Future Production ( Werner Zittel and Jörg Schindler , Energy Watch Group [ EWG ] , March 2007 , www.energywatchgroup.org/).
This report contains ten pages of analysis specific to US coal supplies .
The EWG authors note ,
Until the year 2000 , productivity [ the amount of coal produced per worker hour ] steadily increased for all types of coal produced covering surface and subsurface mining .
But since then productivity has declined by about 10 % . . . .
The decline in productivity can only be explained by the necessity of rising efforts in production .
This might be due to deeper digging and / or to a higher level of waste production .
Are these already indications for the era of ‘ easy coal ’ drawing to a close ?
The EWG report offers several peaking scenarios for US coal .
The most optimistic shows a peak in 2070 :
However , the authors warn that " Even if volumetric production rates can be increased by about 60 % until 2070 - 2080 before decline sets in , the corresponding energy production will increase only by about 45 - 50 % due to the increased share of sub - bituminous coal and lignite . "
Like the National Academy of Sciences , the EWG authors believe that the official estimated recoverable reserves figure is too large .
They offer two alternative scenarios for future production : one in which only recoverable reserves at existing mines are considered producible ( peak in 2015 ) , and the other in which reported estimated recoverable reserves are all producible , but regional production trends are taken into account peak in 2040 ) .
They suggest that " The real profile will be somewhere between these two extremes . "
A third peaking forecast is based on an LBST ( German renewable energy consultancy Ludwig Bölkow Systemtechnik ) analysis , which is itself based on USGS production forecasts in 2000 using 1995 data .
The USGS forecast is corrected for actual production in the intervening years , and a future production profile is chosen in accordance with past production trends and likely production growth ( Montana and Illinois are assumed to provide only marginally increased amounts ) .
It is this fourth scenario , with a peak around 2025 , that the EWG authors appear to consider most reasonable .
The authors conclude :
Considering the insights of the regional analysis it is very likely that bituminous coal production in the US has already peaked , and that total ( volumetric ) coal production will peak between 2020 and 2030 .
The possible growth to arrive at peak measured in energy terms will be lower , only about 20 % above today ’s level .
. . .
[ T ] he 250 billion ton figure [ the current official estimate of recoverable reserves ] should not be the basis for energy planning .
The various EWG scenarios suggest that if Montana and Illinois can resolve their production blockages , or the nation becomes so desperate for energy supplies that environmental concerns are simply swept away , then the peak will come somewhat later , while the decline will be longer , slower , and probably far dirtier .
3. Lignite and Hard Coal : Energy Suppliers for World Needs until the Year 2100 – An Outlook ( Thomas Thielemann , Sandro Schmidt , and J. Peter Gerling , German Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources [ BGR ] , International Journal of Coal Geology Volume 72 , Issue 1 , 3 September 2007 , http://www.sciencedirect.com/).
This paper forecasts no bottleneck in coal supplies and a large potential for expanding coal - to - liquids ( CTL ) production .
It offers relatively little detail for individual producing countries and makes no attempt at a peaking analysis .
For the US , the explicit conclusion is that there will be no coal supply problems this century .
4. A Supply - Driven Forecast for the Future of Global Coal Production ( Höök , Zittel , Schindler , and Aleklett ; Energy Policy , in press , www.tsl.uu.se/).
Much of this report repeats data and arguments from the prior EWG publication .
The conclusions for the US are also similar :
It is reasonable that USA with its huge energy consumption will be among the first in the Big Six to peak in coal production .
All major coal - producing states , except Wyoming , seem to be near or past peak production .
It should however be noticed that environmental laws and other socioeconomic restrictions probably prevent a significant amount of coal from being produced in the near future , especially high - sulfur coals .
A relaxation of the restrictions will therefore probably be able to increase the reserves , but whether this relaxation will happen or not is hard to tell and not considered in the forecast .
. . .
The decline in heat value shows that the best American coals are gone and that poorer and poorer coals are exploited each year .
The decrease in mining productivity is an also in line with the fact that the most easy - accessible coal is gone .
" A Supply - Driven Forecast " contains two new charts , one a high - case and the other a low - case scenario .
The higher case " depicts a continued rapid expansion of Wyoming together with a build - up of the capacity in Montana . "
The lower case " does not envision a dramatic increase of the Montanan coal production and consequently the production level from Montana remains at its current level . "
In the higher case , production peaks around 2040 ; in the lower case , which the authors regard as " more realistic , " the decline commences around 2030 .
5. Hubbert linearization and curve - fitting ( Rutledge and Laherrère ) .
David Rutledge , Tomiyasu Professor of Electrical Engineering at the California Institute of Technology and Director of Caltech ’s Lee Center for Advanced Networking , in a presentation at Caltech in October 2007 , used Hubbert linearization analysis to estimate future global coal production ( http://rutledge.caltech.edu/).
Rutledge argues that , in any region for which we have something close to a complete production history ( i.e. , production has declined substantially due to resource depletion — e.g. , British coal or US lower - 48 oil ) , historic reserves estimates typically have turned out to be too high .
As we have seen , this position is now in effect supported by NAS on the basis of recent site - specific case studies .
Rutledge goes on to argue that Hubbert linearization often yields a more accurate forecast of ultimately recoverable reserves .
Rutledge applies linearization to North American coal producing regions , " with trends for the East ( 40 Gt ) , West ( 25 Gt ) , reserves for Montana ( 68 Gt ) , and trends for Canada and Mexico ( 2Gt total ) . "
This results in an estimate of total ultimately recoverable reserves of 135 billion tons , roughly half the reserves figure now used by official agencies .
Veteran petroleum geologist Jean Laherrère has charted two Hubbert curves for US coal ( " Combustibles fossiles : quel avenir pour quel monde ? "
http://aspofrance.viabloga.com/), one assuming an ultimate production of 150 billion tons ( which is roughly in line with Rutledge ’s conclusion just cited ) , and the other assuming 300 billion tons ( which is somewhat more than the current official ERR ) .
The production peak in the former case occurs in 2025 ; in the latter case , decline commences after 2060 .
Implications
With oil and natural gas prices rising at alarming rates , the return of the US to a greater reliance on coal might seem inevitable .
The nation is currently paying over $ 620 billion per year for petroleum imports , and this ongoing transfer of wealth abroad cannot help but have a substantial negative impact on the domestic economy .
There are three ways to moderate that impact : reduce consumption of liquid fuels through conservation ; produce more fuels domestically ; or electrify transport , which will require more electricity .
Coal could help with either of the latter two strategies .
Given that the nation possesses so much coal , and that energy from coal is still relatively cheap , it would seem inevitable that strong arguments will be made for a dramatic increase in coal production to help solve the nation ’s energy problems .
Yet if most of the recent analyses cited here are correct , this strategy has a short shelf life .
Within the planning horizon for any coal plant proposed today lie much higher coal prices and perhaps even resource scarcity .
The sheer amounts of coal that will be needed in order to offset any significant proportion of oil ( and perhaps also natural gas ) consumption , and to meet the projected increased demand for electricity , are mind - boggling .
Coal is a lower - quality fossil fuel in the best case , and America is being forced to use ever lower - quality coal .
Just to offset the declining heating value of US coal while meeting EIA forecasts for electricity demand growth by 2030 , the nation will then have to mine roughly 80 percent more coal then than it is doing currently .
If carbon sequestration and other new technologies for consuming coal are implemented , they will increase the amount of coal required in order to produce the same amount of energy for society ’s use , since the energy penalty for capture and sequestration is estimated at up to 40 percent .
A broad - scale effort to produce synthetic liquid fuels from coal ( CTL ) will also dramatically increase coal demand .
If the current trend to expand coal exports continues , this would stimulate demand even further .
Altogether , there is a realistic potential for more than a doubling , perhaps even a tripling , of US coal demand and production by 2030 — which would hasten exhaustion of the resource from many current mining regions and draw the inevitable production peak closer in time .
Assuming this higher demand scenario ( from CTL , increased exports , and growing electricity consumption ) , by 2030 the nation ’s dependence on coal will be much greater than is currently the case , and coal ’s proportional contribution to the total US energy supply will have grown substantially .
But at the same time , prices for coal are likely to have increased precipitously because of transport bottlenecks and higher transport costs ( due to soaring diesel prices ) , falling production trends in many current producing regions , and the lack of suitable new coalfields .
The interactions of high and rising coal prices with efforts to maximize output are hard to predict .
As limits to domestic coal production appear , exports could diminish and there could instead be efforts to import more coal , probably from South America .
But in that case the US economy would suffer increasingly from economic dependencies and geopolitical vulnerabilities that already hobble the nation as a result of its oil imports .
It may be tempting to think of coal as a transitional energy source for the next few decades , while a longer - term energy strategy emerges .
But in that case , an important question arises :
Will there be sufficient investment capital and technical resources in three or four decades to fund the transition to the next energy source , whatever it may be ?
By that time ( assuming EIA projections are reasonably accurate ) , demand for energy will be higher .
The price of oil , gas , and coal will be higher — perhaps much higher — and so the nation will be spending proportionally much more of its GDP on energy than it does now .
Meanwhile , the energy cost of building new infrastructure of any kind will be higher .
Therefore it is likely that insufficient investment capital will be available for the large number of new energy projects required .
The transition if deferred will thus be more expensive and difficult than it would be now .
Indeed , the longer a transition to an ultimate ( and sustainable ) energy regime is put off , the harder that transition becomes .
Coal currently looks like a solution to many of America ’s fast - growing energy problems .
However , this is a solution that , if applied on a broad scale , seems certain only to exacerbate the nation ’s energy dilemma in the long run , as well as contributing to an impending global climate catastrophe .

Previous MuseLetters on global coal supply issues are archived on Global Public Media ( www.globalpublicmedia.com):
All other beverages consume huge amounts of water and energy during their production processes , which makes their ecological impact far more detrimental than that of bottled water .
Like bottled water , most of them are distributed in bottles and cans , too .
( Illustration : plan59 )
Bottled water is under attack from environmentalists who preach that tap water has a similar quality and saves a lot of energy since it does not need to be transported by trucks .
That might be true , but bottled water is not our biggest problem when it comes to drinking habits .
Drinking bottled water is a much more ecological choice than consuming soft drinks , coffee , fruit juice or beer .
Water drinkers should be praised instead of criticized .
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The new smokers
Bottled water has become one of the most powerful symbols of unsustainable practices .
Giles Coren , an English food journalist , has coined bottled water drinkers “ the new smokers ” .
These fierce criticisms are understandable .
After all , most western countries have good quality tap water , which makes bottled water ( often from the same water sources ) a bit of an absurdity .
But , denouncing bottled water misses the point .
Indeed , trucking around tap water in plastic bottles creates unnecessary energy use and waste .
However , so does trucking around Coca - Cola , Stella Artois and Chivas Regal .
It is unfair to solely blame water even though it also happens to be distributed via pipes .
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
" Switching from other beverages to bottled water would yield much more environmental profit than switching from bottled water to tap water "
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
More importantly , all other beverages use vast amounts of water and energy to produce , while water - even bottled water - does not .
It takes water to grow crops , and it takes energy to fertilize , harvest and transport them .
Breweries use water and energy too .
It takes 35 litres of water to produce one cup of tea , and 140 litres of water to produce one cup of coffee .
When you add sugar in your coffee or tea , it gets even worse : every teaspoonful of sugar requires 50 cups of water to grow .
A glass of beer takes 75 litres of water to produce , while just one glass of wine asks 120 litres of water .
One glass of fruit juice or milk requires 170 to 200 litres of water .
A glass of brandy asks 2,400 litres of water ( all numbers taken from these sources ) .
Tea and coffee
Producing one litre of bottled water simply requires a litre of water , and no energy .
Yes , producing and distributing the water bottles does use water and energy , but the same goes for other beverages .
This means that bottled water is a more ecological choice than all other bottled options : beer , wine , milk , fruit juice or soft drinks .
Most likely , drinking bottled water is an even better choice than drinking coffee or tea made with tap water - coffee and tea might weigh less than water , but they are transported over much larger distances .
The only undisputable better choice than bottled water is tap water .
Forcing bottled water drinkers to drink tap water would help the environment – but switching from other beverages ( none of them essential to human health ) to bottled water would yield much more environmental profit .
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
" It is unfair to solely blame water even though it also happens to be distributed via pipes "
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Environmental groups always have something to say about the huge ( and growing ) amounts of bottled water that are being sold , and the huge amount of energy that is needed to transport them .
These figures might be accurate , but bottled water holds only a small share of the market for bottled drinks .
The energy needed to transport soft drinks and beer is far more impressive .
The main problem here is not bottled water .
The main problem is that most people do n’t drink water , but prefer soft drinks , fruit juice , coffee , beer or energy drinks instead .
This message , however , is not so popular because most of us like to discuss the environmental problems of this planet over a couple of beers , or wines , or coffees .
Pariahs
Do n’t get me wrong .
This is not a plea for everyone to start drinking bottled water instead of tap water .
Drinking tap water should be encouraged .
But people who prefer to drink bottled water should not be treated as pariahs , because they are making a much more ecological choice than those of us who choose to consume other beverages .

Cole told members that the NRCC does n’t have enough cash to “ save them ” in November if they do n’t raise enough money or run strong campaigns themselves .
| John Shinkle / POLITICO
GOP leaders warn of election disaster
Shellshocked House Republicans got warnings from leaders past and present Tuesday : Your party ’s message is n’t good enough to prevent disaster in November , and neither is the NRCC ’s money .
The double shot of bad news had one veteran Republican House member worrying aloud that the party ’s electoral woes — brought into sharp focus by Woody Jenkins ’ loss to Don Cazayoux in Louisiana on Saturday — have the House Republican Conference splitting apart in “ everybody for himself ” mode .
Advertisement
“ There is an attitude that , ‘ I better watch out for myself , because nobody else is going to do it , ’ ” the member said .
“ There are all these different factions out there , everyone is sniping at each other , and we have no real plan .
We have a lot of people fighting to be the captain of the lifeboat instead of everybody pulling together . ”
In a piece published in Human Events , the Republicans ’ onetime captain , former House Speaker Newt Gingrich , warned his old colleagues that they face “ real disaster ” on Election Day unless they move immediately to “ chart a bold course of real reform ” for the country .
And in a closed - door session at the Capitol , National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Cole ( R - Okla . ) told members that the NRCC does n’t have enough cash to “ save them ” in November if they do n’t raise enough money or run strong campaigns themselves .
Although a top House Republican brushed aside Gingrich ’s broadside as “ hype from a has - been who desperately wants to be a player but ca n’t anymore , ” the harsh words from Cole were harder to ignore .
“ It was a pretty stern line that he took with us , ” said one House Republican .
Cole , on the defensive in the wake of special election losses in Louisiana and Illinois , pointed his finger Tuesday at his Republican colleagues , telling them that they had been too stingy in helping fund party efforts .
He also complained that the Republicans ran weak candidates in both Louisiana and Illinois — a charge Cole made despite the fact that , as NRCC chairman , he could have played a major role in choosing the party ’s candidates if he had n’t made the decision to stay out of GOP primaries .
In his meeting with members , Cole distributed a document showing that even former Republican political guru Karl Rove had badmouthed Jenkins , according to GOP sources .
It ’s not clear whether Cole meant it as a criticism of Rove or of Jenkins .
But Cole ’s overall message was clear , said members who sat through the meeting : “ If you ’re not out doing your own work , and you ’re waiting for the NRCC to come in at the last minute and save you , it ai n’t gonna happen . ”
That ’s how one lawmaker characterized Cole ’s talk , adding that the NRCC is “ not going to have the resources ” to help all members “ and Democrats will have a lot more money . ”
Republicans are suffering a crisis of confidence after the two special election losses .
There ’s talk that House Minority Leader John A. Boehner and other GOP leaders could be ousted if the party suffers double - digit losses in November .
Gingrich ’s broadside did little to calm the GOP jitters .
While Gingrich softened his blow by circulating it privately to the GOP leadership on Monday — a day before it was publicly released — his language was still strong , and his message was seen as a broad attack on Boehner , Cole and the rest of the Republican leadership .
“ The Republican loss in the special election for Louisiana ’s 6th Congressional District last Saturday should be a sharp wake - up call for Republicans , ” Gingrich wrote .
“ Either congressional Republicans are going to chart a bold course of real change or they are going to suffer decisive losses this November . ”
Gingrich said Republicans cannot rely on the popularity of Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) , the presumptive GOP presidential nominee , to carry them to victory in November .
And he warned that attacks on Sens. Barack Obama ( D - Ill . ) and Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) and on the Rev. Jeremiah Wright , Obama ’s former pastor , could backfire .
“ The Republican brand has been so badly damaged that if Republicans try to run an anti-Obama , anti-Rev. Wright or , if Sen.
Clinton wins , anti-Clinton campaign , they are simply going to fail , ” Gingrich said .
“ This model has already been tested with disastrous results . ”
The NRCC ran TV ads tying Cazayoux to national Democratic figures in the Louisiana special election , only to see Democrats grab control of a House seat that had been in the GOP column for more than three decades .
Gingrich , who was pushed out as speaker following GOP losses in the 1998 midterm elections , advocated “ an emergency , members - only ” meeting of House Republicans in order to hash out a new reform agenda before Memorial Day .
He also called for a “ complete overhaul ” of the NRCC .
Gingrich said that if the GOP leadership would not go along with his plan , “ then the minority who are activists should establish a parallel organization dedicated to real change . ”
He offered nine policy proposals designed to achieve that goal , including repealing federal gas taxes , reforming the Census Bureau and declaring English as the official language of the United States .
Boehner tried to put the best face on Gingrich ’s message .
His spokesman , Michael Steel , said that Boehner “ certainly agrees — and has said repeatedly — that Republicans can only succeed this year by being agents of change and reform . ”
Steel said Republicans have to convince voters that they can “ fix ” Washington and that , in the coming weeks , they will be “ laying out Republican policies that embody the sort of changes we need . ”
But there is no question that Gingrich has identified a nervous undercurrent among House Republicans that could morph into full - fledged panic if the GOP loses a special election next Tuesday in Mississippi .
Republican Greg Davis is squaring off against Democrat Travis Childers for the House seat held by former Rep. Roger Wicker ( R - Miss . ) , who was appointed to the Senate to replace retired Sen. Trent Lott ( R - Miss . ) .
With internal polls from both parties showing the race as a tossup , the GOP is putting on a full - court press .
The White House has dispatched Vice President Cheney to Mississippi to campaign on Davis ’ behalf .
And Wicker , Lott , Sen. Thad Cochran ( R - Miss . ) and Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour will hold events for Davis this weekend and early next week , according to GOP sources .
House Republicans will hold a rally with President Bush on Wednesday morning , with all 199 members invited to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. to show solidarity with the president , according to GOP sources .
I managed .
I read the whole paper , without hyperlinks .
I tried to let myself do nothing , which led to a long , MP3 - free walk , a nap and some more reading , an actual novel .
I drank herb tea ( caffeine was not helpful ) and stared out the window .
I tried to allow myself to be less purposeful , not to care what was piling up in my personal cyberspace , and not to think about how busy I was going to be the next morning .
I cooked , then went to bed , and read some more .
GRADUALLY , over this and the next couple of weekends  one of which stretched from Friday night until Monday morning , like the old days  I adapted .
But recidivism quickly followed ; there were important things to do  deadlines , urgent communications .
You know how it is .
I called Andrea Bauer , an executive and career development coach in San Carlos , Calif .
She assured me that , oddly enough , it takes work to stop working .
“ It takes different formats for different people , and you have to build up to it ; you ca n’t run five miles if you ’ve never run at all . ”
Increasingly , I realized that there is more to the secular Sabbath than an impulse , or even a day off from e-mail .
And there are reasons that nonsecular Sabbaths  the holy days of Christians , Jews and Muslims  have rules that require discipline .
Even for the nonreligious , those rules were once imposed :
You need not be elderly to remember when we had no choice but to reduce activity on Sundays ; stores and offices  even restaurants  were closed , there were certainly no electronics , and we were largely occupied by ourselves or our families .
Now it ’s up to us , and , as Dr. Levy says , there ’s little encouragement .
“ One of the problems with needing to slow down is that within the climate of our primary culture it sounds wishy - washy , ” he said .
But what ’s wishy - washy about taking time off ?
It did n’t seem to me that I had to collect Social Security before I realized that a 70 - hour week was nearly as productive as an 80 - hour one , and if I could n’t get it all done in either , it certainly was n’t because I was taking too much time off .

What Is Detoxification in West Palm Beach , Florida ?
Detox , also known as detoxification , is typically the first action you will undergo when you enroll in an inpatient or an outpatient drug and alcohol addiction rehabilitation program .
However , it is also provided in hospitals and other settings - particularly when the withdrawal symptoms displayed are too severe for you to bear .
In many instances , the purpose of medically managed detox is to avoid any fatal or uncomfortable situations that will arise when you suddenly stop abusing your preferred drug of choice or if you reduce the dosage you are accustomed to .
As such , detoxification centers in West Palm Beach provide physiological healing - which is usually after being addicted to alcohol and / or drugs for an extended period of time .
It usually starts with a treatment process before the full process of detox can start .
NIDA ( the National Institute on Drug Abuse ) reports that after the program has stabilized you , detoxification will shift focus to intensive assistance and oversight to make sure that all your bodily functions are working well as your body continues getting rid of the substances you consumed .
The detox center will also try to manage the typically harsh and uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms that may arise the process .
Understanding Detox Treatment
However , you need to remember that you should not consider detoxification as the complete rehab for alcohol and drug abuse and drug and alcohol addiction - regardless of your drug history .
In fact , drug addiction is both physical and psychological .
As such , you should go for psychotherapeutic treatment after the detox process to address every problem stemming from drug cravings and from the changes these substances made to your brain .
Although detoxification in West Palm Beach , FL . could potentially help you stop consuming alcohol and using drugs in the short term , you will still need follow - up therapy and care .
Doing so will significantly reduce your risk of relapse .
Overall , the importance of detoxification cannot be overemphasized .
This is why almost every drug and alcohol addiction rehab center typically begins with detoxification before transitioning to other therapeutic rehab options .
If someone you love needs help with an addiction problem , you can call anytime to speak with one of our certified drug addiction specialists at 1-877-882-9275 .
Do n't let addiction destroy you or someone you love .

In a high - stakes rivalry pitting two of the world ’s largest defense contractors , Century City - based Northrop Grumman Corp. gambled and won .
The word came down Feb. 29 from the Air Force that a $ 40 - billion contract for aerial refueling tankers would go to Northrop and its partner , Airbus , a unit of Netherlands - based European Aeronautic Defense & Space Co . Shut out was rival Boeing Co. , which thought it had a winner .
It was a decision likened to last month ’s stunning Super Bowl loss by the heavily favored New England Patriots , with the favorite losing a cliffhanger .
The contract is expected to be the last new major Pentagon purchase for at least a decade , and Boeing has been mulling over whether to challenge the decision .
The reasons behind the military ’s decision are only starting to emerge , but experts point to little - noticed moves by Northrop that may have given the edge to its tanker , which will be able to carry more fuel and troops than the plane offered by Boeing .

In a highly risky move , Northrop threatened at one point to pull out of the competition if the Air Force did n’t change the way the aircraft would be evaluated .
The demand paid off .
“ Boeing allowed Northrop to skillfully shape the criteria for selecting the winning plane , ” said Loren B. Thompson , a defense policy analyst who closely followed the tanker competition .
“ In particular they allowed Northrop to shape a scenario that made its larger plane more appealing . ”
The Air Force wants to buy 179 planes -- to be called the KC - 45A -- that can be used to refuel fighters , bombers and transport planes in the air .
They also will be used to carry cargo and passengers .
The new planes will replace KC - 135 tankers that were built in the late 1950s and early ‘ 60s .
How Northrop upset Boeing is expected to be at the heart of a broader inquiry by Congress this spring as “ buy America ” proponents argue that major U.S. military contracts should not lead to jobs being sent overseas .
The Northrop - Airbus proposal calls for converting new Airbus 330 passenger jets , currently built in Toulouse , France , into tankers .
Northrop said the planes for the Air Force would be assembled in Mobile , Ala .

The contract announcement surprised Boeing and its supporters , who thought the Air Force had long favored its tanker candidate , a modified version of the 767 jetliner .
But experts who followed the competition said a closer look at three key moves by the Northrop - Airbus consortium may help explain how it won .
Even before the competition began , the company cobbled together a small cadre of military strategists who determined that Northrop ’s tanker made more sense for the Pentagon ’s shift of strategic focus from Europe to the Middle East and the Pacific .
The larger tankers could fly longer distances and stay “ in station ” to refuel U.S. fighters and bombers for a longer period , crucial requirements for missions in the vast expanse of the Pacific region .
Advertisement
They pointed to a key study showing that there were only 15 airfields for every 1 million square miles in Asia , compared with nearly 40 in the Middle East and 55 in Western Europe .
That issue countered Boeing ’s argument that the Pentagon needed a smaller tanker that could fly out of more bases .
Because of the great distances that would need to be traversed , the new tankers could also be used to carry cargo and troops , a requirement the Air Force initially balked at but eventually was persuaded to add .
The new requirements would be crucial in the evaluation -- the Northrop - Airbus tanker could carry about 90 more passengers and 13 more cargo pallets than Boeing ’s smaller offering .
Second , Northrop executives made sure there would be no language in the Air Force ’s competition documents that would hinder their bid and undermine “ a fair and open competition . ”
Advertisement
Among the issues was language that would have asked the competitors how government subsidies would help pay for the design and development of the tanker , part of a lingering World Trade Organization dispute between the U.S. and the European Union .
Some lawmakers had vowed to ban the Pentagon from doing business with a company involved in the WTO case , effectively eliminating Northrop because its partner , Airbus , was at the center of the trade dispute .
Last , Northrop tried a long shot , throwing what one Pentagon official described as a Hail Mary pass , when it threatened to withdraw its bid if the Pentagon did n’t include a way to score the tankers ’ divergent capabilities above and beyond the minimum requirement that they carry at least 50 passengers and six cargo pallets .
The move put the Air Force in a political pinch because without a competitor , it would have incurred the wrath of Sen.
John McCain , a presidential contender and the chief critic of earlier Air Force plans to lease a fleet of tankers from Boeing .
The lease deal resulted in a procurement scandal and prison sentences for two Boeing executives .
Some Democrats now blame the Arizona Republican for Boeing ’s loss .

With the scoring system , the Air Force found it could conduct a military operation with nearly two dozen fewer planes if it chose the Northrop - Airbus tankers rather than Boeing’s .
“ When this competition began , a larger plane seemed a liability , ” Thompson said .
“ By the end , it became an asset . ”
A Boeing spokesman said its executives Friday “ spent several hours with Air Force leaders , listening and probing , all in an effort to better understand the reasoning behind their decisions . ”
But Mark McGraw , Boeing ’s program manager for the tanker bid , said that he “ left the room with significant concerns ” and that the Chicago - based aviation giant was considering challenging the decision .

The company has 10 days from the day of the briefing to file a protest .
As perplexed Boeing executives weighed their next move , outcries over the contract continued unabated in Congress .
“ We are at risk of losing a major part of our aerospace industry to the Europeans forever , ” Sen. Patty Murray -- a Democrat from Washington state , where the Boeing tanker would have been built -- said on the Senate floor Thursday .
“ What makes this so disturbing is that we ’re outsourcing those jobs to a company that has spent years blatantly working to dismantle the American aerospace industry . ”

Cannabis was downgraded to Class C under Tony Blair Cannabis is to be reclassified as a class B drug , Jacqui Smith has said .
The home secretary said she wanted to reverse Tony Blair 's 2004 downgrading of the drug because of " uncertainty " over its impact on mental health .
The move from class C means the maximum prison sentence for possessing cannabis rises from two years to five years .
Her statement to MPs came despite the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs ' review - commissioned by Gordon Brown - saying it should stay class C. ' Psychotic illness '
Since cannabis was downgraded there has been widespread concern about the increased prevalence of stronger " skunk " varieties .
Ms Smith said this now accounted for 80 % of the cannabis seized on the streets and the drug was nearly three times stronger than in 1995 .
SKUNK
So - called because it has a very strong smell
Three times stronger than other types of cannabis Contains much higher levels of the active ingredient - tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) .
Now accounts for between 70 and 80 % of samples seized by police Six years ago it accounted for 15 % of samples
Head - to - head : drug laws
Are voters getting drugs message ?
She added that the government 's change of heart - which is subject to parliamentary approval - was part of a " relentless drive " .
Ms Smith , who has admitted smoking cannabis while she was a student , told MPs : " There is a compelling case for us to act now , rather than risk the future health of young people .
" Where there is a clear and serious problem , but doubt about the potential harm that will be caused , we must err on the side of caution and protect the public .
" I make no apology for that - I am not prepared to ' wait and see ' . "
In its report , Cannabis : Classification And Public Health , the advisory council described cannabis as a " significant public health issue " .
But it said it should still remain a class C drug , as the risks were not as serious as those of class B substances , such as amphetamines and barbiturates .

The report said the evidence suggested a " probable , but weak , causal link between psychotic illness , including schizophrenia , and cannabis use " .
However , in the population as a whole , it played only a " modest role " in the development of these conditions .
Council chairman Sir Michael Rawlings told BBC Radio 4's World at One : " The strength of things like skunk has n't really changed very much over the last few years but it's now more widely used ...
The question of potency is a very complex area . "
Campaign
The advisory council did not look at the message conveyed to the public or the impact on policing , which it is not legally obliged to do .
Sir Michael added : " The government may want to take other matters into account .
That 's their right .
They are the government . "
In its report the council called for a campaign to reduce the use of cannabis , particularly focusing on young people .
Penalties for drug offences
It also voiced concern over the prevalence of domestic cannabis farms supplying the market and the involvement of organised criminal networks .
Ms Smith said she accepted the vast majority of the council 's recommendations , but not the classification of the drug .
And Gordon Brown said at prime minister 's questions that he believed making cannabis a class B drug was supported by the public and the police .
Last month he said he wanted to " send a message " to young people that using the substance was " unacceptable " .
Class C includes substances such as tranquilisers , some painkillers , GHB ( so - called " liquid ecstasy " ) and ketamine .
Possession of class C drugs is treated largely as a non-arrestable offence .
Chief Constable Tim Hollis , a leader on drugs for the Association of Chief Police Officers , said he and his colleagues from other police forces would not want to take an uniform approach on the issue .
He said : " Our forces will want to retain discretion on how we deal with the problem because they will want to relate it to local circumstances . "

Advertisement Shadow home secretary David Davis said that the government 's reversal of its earlier decision showed the downgrading of cannabis had been a mistake and accused ministers of " dithering " .
Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said that , as its advice had been disregarded , ministers should disband the advisory council of experts and replace it with an advisory council of " tabloid newspaper editors " .
Labour MP Chris Mullin , who was chairman of the Commons home affairs select committee when it recommended that cannabis was downgraded to class C , said : " The government should follow the advice of the experts rather than that of the tabloids . "
But Marjorie Wallace , chief executive of the mental health charity SANE , welcomed Ms Smith 's decision , adding : " We believe there are too many casualties to await the results of further education and research . "
However , Martin Barnes , chief executive of DrugScope , said : " There is no evidence that reclassifying cannabis to Class B will reduce levels of use , levels of harm or the availability of the drug . "

Fears that petrol could hit £ 1.50 a litre by late summer were fuelled yesterday as world oil prices hit yet another record .
US crude oil surged to $ 114.95 a barrel after government data showed an unexpected fall in crude supplies .
US crude stocks , which analysts expected to rise , fell 2.3 m barrels last week , the Energy Information Administration said .
In London , Brent crude futures reached a record high of $ 112.73 a barrel , although both it and US crude later dropped back as dealers took profits .
The renewed surge in oil prices is down to a weak US dollar , in which oil is priced , along with inflows of speculative money and long - term constraints on supply .
" The dominant factor is the US dollar and I expect this to continue , " said Gerard Rigby , an analyst at Sydney - based Fuel First Consulting .
" Whenever you get any kind of good economic news out of the US at the moment , the dollar will rise and oil falls , and the other way round , you get a new oil record . "
The dollar fell to a new low yesterday against the euro of almost $ 1.60 after a barrage of weak news , the worst of which was a report showing housing starts had slumped to their lowest level in 17 years .
" After showing some signs of stabilisation in January and February , the March data on both home sales and construction have resumed their downward trend , " said Julia Coronado , an analyst with Barclays Capital .
The pound also fell to a new low against the euro of 80.87 pence , a fall of 10 % since the beginning of the year , making holidays to Europe more expensive .
But the pound gained slightly against the dollar to $ 1.973 as the dollar weakened more than sterling .
Dealers expect the Bank of England to make further cuts to interest rates , which is likely to undermine the value of holding sterling assets .
On Tuesday this week the website petrolprices.com predicted pump prices could hit £ 1.50 a litre in September .
Thinking before you speak is an important skill to master for all kinds of situations .
It can improve your relationships with other people and enable you to express yourself in a more effective way .
Start by using the THINK acronym to decide if what you have to say is True , Helpful , Inspiring , Necessary , or Kind .
Then , look for ways to choose your words more carefully , such as by pausing and asking for clarification .
You can also think before you speak by using thoughtful communication strategies , such as adopting open body language and focusing on making 1 point at a time .
With a little practice , thinking before you speak will eventually become second nature to you .
Xenophobic bigot Tom Tancredo has come under fire for suggesting at a hearing yesterday in Brownsville , TX , that the proposed border fence ought to be built on the northern side of the town .
Since the beginning of the immigration / border debate , Brownsville has become the " epicenter " of opposition to the fence .
Download Download
Valley Morning Star :
Boos and hisses emanated from the audience for a congressional field hearing when Republican U.S. Rep. Tom Tancredo of Colorado dismissed residents ' concerns that the effort to build 670 miles of fencing along the U.S. - Mexico border by year 's end would damage the environment and destroy a centuries - old bond between residents on both sides of the Rio Grande .
Late in the five - hour hearing , Tancredo returned to a comment made earlier by panelist Betty Perez , a rancher and local activist .
Perez said , `` It really is n't a border to most of us who live down here . ''
Tancredo dismissed Perez 's remarks as a ``multiculturalist attitude toward borders . ''
As jeers rose , Tancredo added , ``I suggest that you build this fence around the northern part of your city . ''
So what side of the border does Tancredo want to see Brownsville sitting ?
It 's nice to see Tancredo get the reaction he deserves .
Perhaps the " I hate everything foreign " card won him some points in the GOP primary , but it does nothing but alienate most sensible and thoughtful Americans .
This is one of those funny questions that pops up in lots of people 's minds .
As you 're driving your car , you can imagine that it would be very easy to move the shifter into the " R " position at any time .
You probably would never even consider giving in to your curiosity , though .
Because you know that if you DID try it , it would cause the transmission to explode , or something like that .
So , instead , you end up constantly wondering …
The reverse gear on any car with a manual transmission is an incredibly simple piece of machinery .
There is a shaft that gets its power from the engine , and it has teeth on it that are used for reverse .
There 's another shaft that will drive the wheels , and it , too , has teeth on it that are used for reverse .
To engage reverse , a gear literally gets pushed in between the two shafts to engage the two sets of teeth .
It simply slides its teeth into the teeth on the two shafts and engages them .

So it turns out that the answer to this question is pretty anticlimatic .
If you were to actually try engaging reverse while rolling down the road , the gear that has to slide into place is going to be trying to engage two spinning gears , and one of those gears is rotating rapidly in the wrong direction .
What you will hear ( and feel in the shift ) is a very obnoxious buzzing sound as the teeth gnash against one another .
However , there 's no way to get the gear into place while in motion like this , so nothing will happen .
The transmission wo n't explode .
Nor will the car stop on a dime and reverse into oncoming traffic , even though that 's what happens in cartoons .
About the only time you can actually get a car into reverse is when it's at a dead stop .
Il fascino di Firenze sta nelle sue vie , nei suoi abitanti nella sua cultura e nella sua romantica atmosfera , fatta di luoghi appartati , opere d'arte , ottimi ristoranti , hotel di lusso e musei stupefacenti .
Camminare per Firenze , è il miglior modo per scoprirla , il miglior modo per entrare in punta di piedi in una città dalle antichissime vestigia che regala al visitatore attento , una serie infinita di opere d'arte sparse qua e là e che ad ogni nuova visita , sembrano non finire mai .
In pochi altri luoghi al mondo è veramente necessaria una buona guida turistica , che nel caso di Firenze , potrebbe essere qualsiasi anziano che è nato e vissuto in questa magnifica città .
I fiorentini sono innamorati della loro città e nessuno meglio di loro , ne conosce e ne sa svelare i suoi segreti .
Posizionata al centro della Toscana e circondata dalle tipiche campagne toscane , Firenze è a breve distanza di altri centri di rilevante importanza storico artistica come Siena , Prato , Arezzo e Pistoia .
La città è attraversata dal fiume
Arno il quale è varcato da uno dei ponti più famosi al mondo " Il Ponte Vecchio " .
Migliaia di turisti ogni giorno varcano questo particolarissimo ponte costituito da botteghe orafe artigiane che rende questo luogo , uno dei punti nevralgici della visita di Firenze .
Migliaia di coppie provenienti da tutto il mondo si son fatte promessa di amore eterno sul Ponte Vecchio di Firenze .
Firenze è conosciuta a livello internazionale per l'alta gioielleria , la lavorazione delle pelli , la moda , il suo artigianato , per le sue manifatture e naturalmente per il fatto di essere una delle città più romantiche al mondo .
La foschia che avvolge Firenze nelle mattine d'inverno , è una vera magia che fotografi di tutto il mondo hanno immortalato , e la vivacità della città e dei suoi abitanti durante il periodo estivo , è una caratteristica che marca ogni singolo visitatore .
Sin dall ' epoca antico romana , l'antica " Florentia " ha goduto di una ricchezza economica prima dovuta all ' agricoltura , in seguito grazie a famiglie di mercanti che hanno reso la città il fulcro della cultura e dell 'arte .
La città di Firenze ha accolto moltissimi maestri d'arte : pittori come Giotto , Cimabue , Caravaggio , scrittori come Dante Alighieri e luminari come Michelangelo solo per citarne alcuni .
Di particolare interesse ed importanza per la città di Firenze , è stata la Famiglia De Medici , facoltosi mercanti che hanno reso la città il fulcro mondiale della cultura e dell 'arte .
Fu la famiglia dei Medici a fondare un " banco di cambio " che è da considerarsi come la prima banca d'Europa .
Tra i vari personaggi di spicco della famiglia , è da annoverare Lorenzo De Medici soprannominato " Il Magnifico " che grazie alle sue doti di politico , fu artefice di uno dei periodi più gloriosi per l'arte e la civiltà italiane , tanto che Firenze venne soprannominata " la seconda Atene " .
Ogni arte e ogni dottrina , dalla pittura alla filosofia , dalla musica alla scultura erano coltivate alla corte del Magnifico .
Per chi vuole scoprire la Toscana , Firenze è il suo capoluogo , assolutamente da visitare almeno per due giorni che saranno appena sufficenti a dare un'impronta della magnificenza e della bellezza di questa città d'arte .
Origine del nome di Firenze
La fondazione di Firenze ( in latino " Florentia " ) coincise con le celebrazioni romane per l'avvento della primavera in onore alla dea Flora .
Bowling , Football , Human Cannonball :
When I started this I swore I would n't bash any of the games .
I grew up on these games and still enjoy them today .
However , these three games are all indeed terrible .
I thought they were bad then and I think they 're even worse now .

One of the core magazine of the Republican conservative establishment has this explicit message to Ron Paul supporters :
[ G]et lost .
There should be plenty of room for [ all of you ] in Obama ’s big tent .
The Republican party seems to be making no attempt to woo or otherwise capture the energy of Congressman Ron Paul ’s supporters .
I admired Mr. Paul ’s campaign – even if I felt I could never support him .
I believe that Mr. Paul ’s campaign got some of the biggest issues facing America right – with regards to federalism , the balance of power , and executive overreach .
On many other issues , I think he argued from a principled and insightful stance – one that those Republicans – and many Democrats – in power today do not take into account .
In foreign policy , he was a military isolationist ; on currency , he was against all regulation .
These stances are radical – but reflect the reality of America less than a hundred years ago .
Although many of those in power ignore this , there are still many fringe aspects of America that they ignore .
Now , the Republican party is rejecting the many young supporters of Mr. Paul – presumably because these elites see these supporters as part of the unwashed masses that get to have a say every four or so years , but who are essentially dumb creatures .
There is a contempt for Mr. Paul ’s supporters that is hard to fathom – especially for a party that is in decline .
I agree with Mr. Goldfarb of the Weekly Standard though .
Barack Obama has many positions at odds with Mr. Paul .
But I think Mr. Paul ’s supporters can find something to support in Mr. Obama ’s platform .
And they are welcome in Obama ’s big tent .
Here ’s a grand liberal - libertarian alliance this November and beyond .

During a recent Firefox 3.0 status meeting , Mozilla developers noted that over 700 bugs in the Firefox bug tracking system are classified as blockers — issues that have to be resolved before the software can be released .
Mozilla subsequently requested that component maintainers adjust bug priorities to reduce the number of blockers and stated that approximately 80 percent of the bug reports currently characterized as blockers will not be closed before the Firefox 3 release .
This statement has been broadly misinterpreted in the press , largely as the result of a New York Times article which conveyed the statistic without framing it in the proper context .
The Times claimed that 80 percent of the bugs would not be fixed , when in reality , resolution of those bugs have simply been deferred so that they do n't delay the release .
Some have interpreted the large number of blockers as a sign that Firefox 3 is irreparably buggy , but those familiar with the open - source software development process know that the real situation is a bit more complex .
The inflated number of blockers does n't reflect problems with the Firefox development process or the program itself .
Rather , it indicates that Firefox community members who actively participate in bug reporting and triaging are having trouble prioritizing the bugs properly .
This is a very common problem that often emerges in large open source development projects towards the end of the release cycle .
A look over the actual list of Firefox 3 blockers reveals that the bug reports do n't all actually reflect bugs .
Many of them relate to feature requests , performance improvement goals , and corner - case rendering issues that only affect specific web pages .
Asking maintainers to reevaluate bug priority is a way for Mozilla to refocus development on the most important issues so that the software is as robust and usable as possible by the release date .
Reclassifying less - significant blockers is a necessary QA strategy that will actually lead to a better Firefox 3 release .
No software will ever be released completely bug - free , and problems that can be fixed in updates after the Firefox 3 release can and should be reclassified at this stage so that they do n't hold up more important development efforts .
In a recent blog entry posted in response to the Times article , volunteer Firefox contributor Robert Accettura provides a concise explanation of this phenomenon .
" In every release cycle , everyone wants every bug to block a release and therefore everyone is ' blocker - happy , ' and later in the cycle , all are changed to non-blocker status except the most critical as perceived by developers , drivers , and testers , " writes Accettura . " [ E ] very bug you fix , feature you add introduces new code , which potentially causes new bugs in other places .
Even if you devote 100 % effort to fixing bugs , you 'll likely never get there ...
Every project involves deciding what bugs ship , and what holds a release .
Every single one .
If there 's someone who does n't , it means their QA is likely flawed or inadequate . "
In response to overblown concerns that a large number of Firefox 's bugs will not be resolved , Firefox community coordinator Asa Dotzler has characterized such claims as " horses * **. "
Dotzler points out that over 11,000 bugs reports and feature requests have already been closed and classified as fixed , a number that dwarfs the remaining 700 blockers .
Mozilla technical strategist Mike Shaver has also responded .
" ' Bug ' in our world — as with with every software shop I 've ever worked , to be honest — includes desired feature improvements , optimizations , basically everything in the gap between ' how the software is ' and ' how someone would like the software to be ' , " explains Shaver .
" Because of history and some tool limitations , and because we now have a larger set of people triaging blocker nominations than we ever have before , the ' blocking ' flag does n't always strictly mean 'we would not ship Firefox 3 if this specific bug is n't fixed . "
I have personally used Firefox 3 alpha nightly builds ( codenamed Minefield ) on a daily basis as my primary web browser .
Although I occasionally get stung by regressions and have to switch back to a stable build for a few days ( I had some performance and stability issues last week that seem to have been resolved since then ) , it is largely very usable .
Firefox 3 includes a tremendous number of very useful and impressive features and it is rapidly approaching the point where it is robust enough for general use .
There is definitely no justification for concerns about the final product at this point .
I INTERVIEWED Zbigniew Brzezinski , Jimmy Carter 's national security adviser and now foreign policy mentor to Barack Obama , before the National Intelligence Estimate on Iran was published .
But it did not go into print until this month ( in World Policy Journal in the US , Prospect magazine in Britain , Global Affairs in Russia and the Arab News in Saudi Arabia , among others ) .
I asked Brzezinski if he wanted to re-write his apocalyptic scenario for Iranian - US relations .
He did n't .
" Some people with good reason fear an Iranian - US military clash before Bush leaves office in 12 months time " , he says .
" There are still some people in the administration of neo -con persuasion who seem to be tempted by what I believe is a suicidal inclination to compound the Iraqi problem by some sort of military action against Iran . "
Brzezinski's fear is that the Iraqi war instead of winding down could be enlarged before Bush 's departure .
" War is inherently dynamic " , reasons Brzezinski .
" There maybe some collisions , flashes , provocations , a clash with Iran , perhaps some terrorist act in the US , which can credibly be blamed on the Iranians .
Al Qaeda has stated not long ago that such a collision between America and Iran will be very much in its strategic interest . "
Brzezinski worries that the US risks becoming " a huge gated community self - isolated from the world ...
One of my indictments of Bush is that he has fostered a culture of fear in this country rather than diminished it . "
For America to give Iran a military thump that it wo n't easily forget it is not necessary for Bush to have convincing intelligence that it is building a nuclear weapon .
US - Iranian relations have soured for many reasons , not just the nuclear one , and conflict could be ignited over Iranian support for Shia movements in Iraq , the support for anti-American warlords in Afghanistan or because of an Al Qaeda initiated provocation .
The outcome would be disastrous .
Muslim opinion all over the world is already extremely anti-American .
It would be further enraged and the hand of Al Qaeda and its allied movements strengthened , not least some of the Pakistani religious militants who are already one step closer to capturing control of Pakistan 's nuclear weapons than they were six months ' ago .
So what could be on Bush 's mind ?
What are the hard men behind him , such as Vice - President Richard Cheney , pushing for ?
The Middle East experts , Vali Nasr and Ray Takeyh , attempt to answer that question in the current issue of Foreign Affairs .
" For the Bush administration containing Iran is the solution to the Middle East 's various problems " , they write .
Its officials " seem to feel that in the midst of disorder and chaos lies an unprecedented opportunity for reshaping the region so that it is finally at ease with US dominance and Israeli prowess . "
That such a scenario is built on what most of us would regard as a fantasy seems not to bother them .
But can one really imagine Sunni Arab states will unite to support the present Shia dominated Iraqi government so as to undermine Iranian influence there ?
Or that Saudi Arabia will work to de-claw Hezbollah because they fear Shia primacy in Lebanon ?
Or that Israel and the Arabs will work together against Hamas in Palestine to thwart Iranian influence ?
Well , if you believe all this it is not surprising that you also believe that Iran , with or without a bomb , can never be a constructive presence in the Middle East .
Yet there is no sign that Iran , as it did under the Shah , is seeking to become the pivotal state in the region .
It is not creating disorder to fulfil some misread scriptural promise .
Nor is it by nature an expansionist power .
Iran has not begun a war for over 200 years .
When Saddam Hussein's Iraq attacked Iran , Iran was clearly the innocent party .
The Arab states may worry about Iran 's growing influence , but they know a good part of the reason is Israeli intransigence with the Palestinians .
Continuous and consistent pro Palestinian support has given Iran a big return on its soft power , whilst American hard power is a declining asset — there is no way that the US can maintain large numbers of troops in the region indefinitely .
With Iraq still a quagmire , with Nato partners losing the war in Afghanistan , with Lebanon in turmoil , and with very little prospect of substantial Israeli concessions to the Palestinians , this is not the time for cranking up hostility towards Iran .
As Nasr and Takeyh remind us , " The last time the US rallied the Arab world to contain Iran , in the 1980s , Americans ended up with a radicalised Sunni political culture that eventually yielded Al Qaeda . "

With British Prime Minister Gordon Brown poised to reclassify marijuana as a more serious drug subject to stiffer penalties , the United Kingdom appears to be in the grip of an outbreak of Reefer Madness that would make Harry Anslinger blush .
Fueled by the country 's widely - read tabloid press and used by opposition Conservatives as a club with which to beat Brown 's Labor government , the marijuana moral panic is a key element in what appears almost certain to be Brown 's retreat from marijuana law reform .
1930 's '' Reefer Madness ' ' - style film poster
If , as is widely expected , Brown actually does order marijuana reclassified from Class C to Class B , which would mean a return to routine arrests for simple possession and an increase in penalties for trafficking , he will be ignoring the recommendation of the government 's own drug policy - setting panel , the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs ( ACMD ) , which has called for marijuana to remain Class C. Instead , Brown will be siding with law enforcement , concerned moms , and the mental health - drug treatment complex , all of whom are loudly howling that the drug is so dangerous it must be reclassified .
The British tabloid press , exemplified by the Daily Mail , has become a leading actor in the debate over reclassification , breathlessly reporting scary story after scary story about marijuana and its effects , particularly on youth .
Here are just a handful of recent Daily Mail Reefer Madness headlines : " Son twisted by skunk knifed father 23 times , " " How cannabis made me a monster , " " Escaped prisoner killed man while high on skunk cannabis , " " Boys on skunk butchered a grandmother , " and " Teen who butchered two friends was addicted to skunk cannabis . "
In another article , " How my perfect son became crazed after smoking cannabis , " the Mail consults an unhappy mother whose child ran into problems smoking weed .
Last fall , the Mail was warning of " deadly skunk . "
While the Mail 's preoccupation with skunk , a decades - old indica - sativa hybrid , is novel , it has also been hitting some more familiar themes .
In an article headlined " Cannabis : A deadly habit as easy for children to pick up as a bag of crisps , " after blaming marijuana for the problems of British youth culture and prohibition - related violence , the Mail breathlessly reports that skunk is n't your father 's marijuana .
The other problem for the Government and others who urged the then Home Secretary David Blunkett to downgrade cannabis in the run-up to 2004 , is that the drug on sale to young people on the streets today is very different from the one ministers thought they were downgrading .
Doctors believe that this new strain has the potential to induce paranoia and even psychosis .
Some of those we met who work with young criminals link the advent of the new drug with the growth and intensity of street violence .
Uanu Seshmi runs a small charity in Peckham , where gun crime is rife , which aims to help boys excluded from school escape becoming involved in criminal gangs .
He has seen boys come through his doors who are " unreachable " and he blames the new higher strength cannabis sold on the streets as " skunk " or " super skunk " for warping young minds .
" It is n't the cannabis of our youth , 20 or 30 years ago , " he told me .
" This stuff damages the brain , its effects are irreversible and once the damage is done there is nothing you can do . "
While such yellow journalism from the likes of the tabloid press is no surprise , even the venerable Times of London is feeling the effects of skunk fever .
Under the headline Cannabis : ' just three drags on a skunk joint will induce paranoia ' , the Times managed to find and highlight a gentleman named Gerard who does n't like that particularly variety of pot :
I smoke around six joints of regular cannabis every week , mostly at the weekends .
What I like about smoking hash or weed is that it keeps me calm and gives me a more amusing outlook on life .
With skunk , it 's a completely different story .
Just three drags on a skunk joint will induce paranoia on a massive scale .
As Britain 's pro-cannabis reform media outlet Cannazine noted , " As a result of Gerard 's personal experience with cannabis , The Times published a story to Google News which will ultimately go on to form part of the over - all anti-cannabis diatribe we are all subjected to daily .
Is there any wonder at all why the world has such a confused view of what is really a hugely important social issue within the UK ? "
Fortunately for British pot-smokers , smoking high - potency strains is not likely to turn them into mental patients or psycho- killers , said Dr. Mitch Earleywine -- and it may even be better for them than smoking low - potency weed .
" The tacit assumption that increased potency translates into greater danger from the drug is untrue , " he said .
" In fact , marijuana with greater amounts of THC may is probably less hazardous than weaker cannabis .
Stronger cannabis leads to smoking smaller amounts .
Smoking smaller quantities could provide some protection against the health problems normally associated with inhaling smoke .
Smokers may take smaller , shorter puffs when using more potent marijuana .
Smoking less may decrease the amount of tars and noxious gases inhaled , limiting the risk for mouth , throat , and lung damage .
Obviously , avoiding smoke completely would eliminate these problems , " he said , suggesting that eating cannabis may be an alternative .
While marijuana potency has increased over the years , claims of dramatic potency increases " suffered from exaggeration or misinformation , " said Earleywine .
The same could be said about claimed links between marijuana and schizophrenia , he suggested .
" The obvious stuff , that pot does n't cause schizophrenia but schizophrenics like pot , tends to apply here , " he said .
" The longitudinal studies often do a great job of assessing psychosis at the end of the period but a poor job of assessing symptoms at the beginning of the study .
There are now about five longitudinal studies suggesting increases in ' psychotic disorders ' or ' schizophrenic spectrum disorders ' in folks who are heavy users of cannabis very early in life .
There are also six studies to show more symptoms of schizo - typal personality disorder in cannabis users .
Note that none of these are full - blown schizophrenia , the rare , disabling disorder that affects about 1 % of the population , " he said .
" The best argument against this idea comes from work showing that schizophrenia affects 1 % of the population in every country and across every era , regardless of how much cannabis was used at the time or up to ten years before , " Earleywine added .
For California court - certified cannabis cultivation expert Chris Conrad , the British obsession with skunk is somewhat mystifying .
" Skunk is just another hybrid cannabis strain , " he said .
" It was developed by Dave Watson , and I believe it is 75 % sativa and 25 % indica with a strong aromatic flavor , hence the name .
There is also ' Super Skunk ' that adds more indica , which is what differentiates it from regular skunk .
But the name and any alleged " skunk effect " are not related in any reality - based way , because that same effect is derived from all hybrid strains . "
While scoffing at the sensationalized claims of skunk 's powers , Conrad pointed to one real , but minor , risk associating with using high - potency marijuana .
" Individuals with low blood sugar , low blood pressure and a tendency toward fainting may pass out after smoking a few hits of very strong cannabis , usually indica strains grown indoors .
That 's it .
The only danger seems to be bumping your head if you fall over . "
If the British press wanted to warn readers of real potential problems with high - potency marijuana , it would tell them to be careful around strong cannabis if they have low blood pressure and / or a history of fainting , said Conrad .
" But instead of responsibly advising the public that certain individuals who are easily identified by their medical history should be careful to sit down when they smoke very strong cannabis -- the media instead uses this to fan fears , glamorize the drug war and sell newspapers without even bothering to give their readers the only useful information they need to know about the topic .
Somebody should be fired for allowing them to publish lies like they have been doing .
Shame on them . "
" We are in the middle of a full - blown Reefer Madness moral panic , " said Steve Rolles of the Transform Drug Policy Foundation .
" It is , of course , political -- opponents of the government are attacking it using the 2004 reclassification as a basis .
Any bad things that happen involving cannabis can be blamed on the government , and any research that illustrates cannabis harms used to show how weak and irresponsible the government is .
The government is on the verge of caving into the pressure , rather than arguing the case for the policy , " he noted .
And while the Daily Mail is a tabloid ( a rough American equivalent would be the New York Post ) , it is influential , Rolles said .
" It influences the government because it is read by a large number of floating voters who switched from Tory to Labor and will potentially switch back , " he argued .
" The Mail has a disproportional impact on politicians because of its reader demographic and correspondingly has a disproportional impact on the news agenda and general popular political discourse .
The memes about cannabis harms -- particularly mental illness and young people , the potent new ' skunk ' , links to violent crime -- and the fact that reclassification , and by implication the government , are responsible for it all are very much perpetuated by the Mail .
It 's the old story about the Government ' sending out messages ' to young people , " he said .
The Daily Mail is a political actor in opposition to the Labor government , Rolles noted .
" The Mail despises the government for various reasons -- mostly to do with its editor who is a reactionary - right moral authoritarian with a classic conservative view of a traditional Britain under attack from various wicked modern cultural forces . "
The Daily Mail 's Reefer Madness reporting serves the political ends of the Conservatives , Rolles explained .
" Their home affairs spokesman , David Davis , is like a drug war jack in the box , popping up at every opportunity and deploying one of a selection of set phrases linking all of the above ; government being weak , sending out the wrong message , cannabis harms , reclassification being the cause of all the problems , and his solution -- ignore the ACMD , reclassify , and most absurdly ; ' secure our borders ' .
It 's fear mongering and sound - tough drug war idiocy on a quite epic scale . "
But that idiocy will most likely be sufficient to sway the Labor government into moving resolutely backwards on marijuana policy .
For American readers in particular , for whom such reporting seems like something out of the 1930s , the role of the reactionary British press in setting marijuana policy should be an object lesson .

It seemed that Segalman was trying to tell us the connection between the Indian casino gaming boys and his case with the education lottery which Abramoff was trying to squelch , which would be the motive .
And Abramoff ties into McCain at some point and ' McCain 's Media ' could n't let that happen .

I agree with the above sentiments that Dan Abrams dropped the ball .
It 's real easy to come out " fighting for justice , " after stories have already emerged .
He also seemed to be playing lawyer rather than truthseeker .
Maybe Siegelman could blog here ?
I respect how humble he is , how he is trying to get people to see the big picture .
Abrams is just trying to get ratings , imho .

Ancient , definitely a case for an independent prosecutor or even a special prosecutor under the next DEMOCRATIC administration .
In a way , I am glad that the appeal is supposed to be delayed because I do n't want any more investigations and prosecutions taking place under the current DOJ .
I expect that there will be many such cases down the line because " justice " has been so politicized under Cheney / Bush .
Is n't there something involving a judge in Mississippi rearing its head ?

It would be nice to find a credible , and well - researched article that explains how Abramoff fits in to all of this .
Cheney was just in Kentucky last week , and only six people greeted him at the airport , one Hal Rogers who received $ 30,000 from Abramoff .
Apparently , Abramoff 's further prosecution has been squelched some way in Alabama , but there are so many players it 's difficult to find the " head of the octopus . "
The Republicans must have written a business plan to take control of the country with the millinneum .
It 's when the panic propaganda and Y2 K scares began .
Down by the Warner Robins , Georgia Air Force Base , 1999 they feigned a helicopter crashing into a bus and even painted up real people to appear bloody - injured .
They taped the expensive stunt as a " practice session " for rescue workers .
After seeing the helicopter take a verticle dive beyond the trees from the back yard view , it was a relief when the local newspaper explained the incident .
When 911 happened I figured they 'd show a helicopter crashing into a bus on TV .
Same year somebody dropped an " anthrax " envelope on the CNN station building in Atlanta , and the entire building was evacuated .
And in the news , some Navy guys were court - martialed for refusing anthrax vaccination shots .
Some took them , and died .
Seems all of this madness started well before " 911 . "
And maybe Siegelman 's demise is part of a larger " takeover " plan where corporations and private industry will replace government as we 've known it .
The Republicans have definitely been fighting to continue war , enrich and reward corporations , private business , and overseas endeavors , and agressively destroy anyone or anything in their paths .
Cheney and the Bush White House have defied law , and dared those who question ; even violated the privacy of the Americans who pay their salaries .
Congress sings along with them and allows it .
It will probably be internet bloggers who will finally uncover the truth about this and other long - term plans since the country became dark and frightening with the Assassination Years .
They still have n't explained the double murder / suicide with Strategum , and why so many Republicans are dying in crashes , hanging , accident , suicide , etc .
So quickly we forget , and it 's very possibly linked .
Dead men tell no tales .
Sorry for the history lesson , and thoughts somewhat , " off subject " - but I believe Siegelman was probably on a long - term , well - designed hit list along with many others .
The fact they have n't diligently scrutinized Baldwin County voting records is proof there 's plenty of water already over the dam .

That statement by KRs lawyer jumped out at me :
" As KR has repeatedly stated , he did not speak with anyone in the WH or the JD concerning the prosecution of Siegelman . "
This Rove / Siegelman issue goes way back , at least 14 years .
Rove is both a brilliant strategist and word - parser .
It 's completely understandable that KR would have set this Siegelman smear up long before his team was ever in the WH , and that he and Bush would have had a pre-presidential agreement that they would never speak of any of their illegal pre-2000 shenanigans once George was in the WH .
Re KRs professed willingness to testify .
Sure .
Why not .
He 's made sure he never technically lied , so all a high - profile testimony will do for him is sell his book .
BTW , how is his book doing ?

No plans to purchase Rove 's book , but check out what they did to former Governor Paul Patton of Kentucky .
I 've often wondered if his mistress situation was a lure , bait and hook tactic .
Patton came on TV with tissues and appologies .
His life was ruined .
Then Republican Physician Ernie Fletcher became Governor and nearly his entire cabinet committed crimes and received pardons .
Neocon strategy is defy the law and destroy anyone who gets in the way , then pardon all your investor / business buddies .
To take Georgia they tagged a veterinarian , Sonny Perdue , a lifelong Democrat , to swap parties .
And he got up and prayed to the Lord Almighty for rain .

Since 1885 there have been about 350 Governors in the South 's 11 most southeastern states .
Of those , about 40 have been Republican , and of those , almost half were elected Governor since 1990 , which reveals a trend or plan .
A liberal friend believes the very rare KKK types in the South are Republican , but he's not old enough to know they were die - hard Democrats years ago because in those days few knew what a Republican was .
What happened , is " those " switched over and became Republicans .
More hate crimes happen outside the South and it's very exciting Obama is proving the South has been misjudged and stereotyped by the MSM .

I do not think Dan Abrams dropped the ball .
He must be circumspect , and the governor must get a PR person .
The governor went from being an elite to being a prisoner in a sicko system .
That totally kicked his ass , as it would anyone .
And clearly , for those who do not yet get it , he is suffering from PTSS , because the joint is a place that will fuck you up bigtime if you have lived the good life and all of a sudden get " jointed " .
He needs to let someone else deal with the public until he heals a bit .
What he is saying is the truth , however , when the fuck has that ever mattered ?
The rovian gang of bushies dragged a tree behind them to cover their trail .
And it will take very professional procedure to handle this matter and track the fascists back to the bung hole .
Most panty waist dems still think Amurka is smaller than America .

It was just before 911 .

I wish more folks would come forward .
A supreme court justice has done so in Missippi , and as we fully expected , the Siegelman case is not rare :
What emerges during our interview are allegations of even more aggressive prosecutorial tactics and intimidation than has previously been reported .
The allegations seem to fit the pattern of prosecution in Alabama , where another Bush - appointed US Attorney successfully prosecuted a popular democratic governor for bribery .
As in Alabama , Diaz was indicted a second time after the first set of charges failed to hold up in court .
Diaz was ultimately acquitted and still retains his state Supreme Court seat .
... “ After I was indicted and before my trial , my home was also broken into , ” Diaz tells RAW STORY .
“ Our door was kicked in and our documents were rummaged .
Televisions , computers and other valuables were not taken , despite the fact that we were out of town for several days and the home was left open by the burglars .
We could not figure out a motive for the burglary and reported it to the Biloxi Police Department .
The crime was never solved . ” ( Raw Story , emphasis added ) .
Wow , sounds like something from the Clint Curtis files .

But utilities in Vermont , like their counterparts elsewhere in the country , argue that environmental advocates are mistaken if they believe a low - emission future can be achieved without nuclear power .
They note the intermittency of power sources like windmills and solar panels , and argue that the nation needs more , not fewer , big power plants that emit no carbon dioxide .
“ Vermont is in an enviable position right now , ” said Steve Costello , a spokesman for the state ’s largest utility , Central Vermont Public Service .
“ We have arguably the cleanest power in the country from an air - emissions standpoint , and we have the lowest rates in the Northeast . ”
His utility is willing to build more renewables , he said , but closing Vermont Yankee would make maintaining clean and cheap power “ much more difficult . ”
Even as some Vermonters argue for more renewable power , proposals to build it have hit snags .
Vermont has only one commercial wind farm , 11 turbines along a mountain ridge .
They have less than 1 percent of the capacity of Vermont Yankee , a relatively small nuclear plant .
Other proposed projects have been stalled by local opposition .
One wind project would infringe on bear habitat .
Another won approval from state regulators , but a local group filed a court appeal to block it .
“ Vermont is very protective of its environment regulation , ” said Mr. Perchlik of Renewable Energy Vermont .
“ It ’s not going to be done Texas - style , where you can get a permit in a month . ”
He nonetheless hopes that wind turbines can provide 20 percent of Vermont ’s electricity by 2015 .
Besides tapping into the Northeastern grid , Vermont could import more power from Hydro Quebec , a giant dam system in Canada that already accounts for a third of Vermont ’s electricity , but that would probably help push up prices .
Solar power is also costly .
Burning wood chips or other plant material is one option 
Burlington already has such a plant  but a large one would face pollution and other problems .
Afghans tend to be stoic in the face of poverty , hardship and seemingly endless warfare .
But mess with their cellphones , and the response is one of undiluted outrage .
For the last two months , Taliban fighters have been blowing up telecommunications towers , with the aim of preventing NATO - led forces from hunting them down via cellphone signals .
It could hardly have been a worse public - relations move for the insurgency .
Fuming Afghans call the tactic nonsensical .
“ I ’m so , so furious about this , ” sputtered businessman Rahim Agha .
“ Why do they have to do this to us ?
Why ca n’t they just turn off their phones ? ”

To Afghans , the country ’s rapidly expanding cellphone network is a symbol of pride and hoped - for prosperity .
Cellphones are a lifeline to Afghanistan ’s vast rural hinterlands , an engine of commerce , and a vital link with millions of Afghan refugees around the world .
There is intense competition among the country ’s cellphone providers -- four private companies and a state - run one .
Spurred by the scramble for revenue , they provide service in 70 % of Afghanistan ’s territory , from trackless deserts to jagged mountains .
The customer base has essentially doubled every year for three years .
About 5.4 million people , about one in six Afghans , have a cellphone , an extraordinary rate of market penetration in a country so poor .
“ Just look around in any bazaar , ” said Amirzai Sangin , the minister of communications .
“ Everyone in sight has a cellphone . ”
Advertisement
That includes Taliban fighters -- and therein lies the problem .
North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces recently have had unusual success in tracking and targeting mid-level Taliban field commanders , killing scores of them in pinpoint airstrikes .
Military officials , without giving details , say they have a variety of means of conducting such manhunts , but the fighters blame cellphone signals for giving away their location .
The reach and availability of cellphones apparently have been seductive even to some fugitive commanders , who use numbers only for a short time before discarding them .
In addition to attacking about a dozen towers , the insurgents have threatened the telecom companies , forcing them to cut off service at night in southern Afghanistan .
More than a quarter of a million people have been affected by disrupted service across the south , where fighting between insurgents and coalition troops is the most intense .
Advertisement
A few weeks ago , insurgents killed two police officers escorting engineers who had been sent to repair a disabled tower .
Medical professionals are particularly alarmed by the curtailed service .
In remote villages , when someone falls ill or a childbirth takes a perilous turn , families are unable to call for help or get advice on how to provide emergency treatment , said Merza Khan , who runs a health clinic in the southern province of Helmand .
“ People are dying from the lack of communication , ” he said .
Because travel in the south is so dangerous , and land - line phone service is rare outside cities , cellphone conversations often replace face - to - face encounters .
Advertisement
“ I ca n’t always travel to where my constituents are , ” said Anwar Khan , a member of parliament from Helmand province .
“ But they would use their cellphones to talk to me , to tell me what was happening .
Now they can ’t . ”
The Taliban , though , may be reconsidering its highly unpopular campaign .
Commanders have been quoted as saying they are aware of the angry public backlash and may allow the resumption of normal service .
Sangin , the Afghan communications minister , said he had heard reports that fighters themselves were grumbling about the restrictions , suggesting that the entire contretemps might have been caused by a lack of discipline in the militants ’ ranks when it comes to cellphone usage .
“ This is not an attack on the coalition or the government , but on the people , ” Sangin said .
“ Cellphones are a huge part of everyday life , and no one is willing to go back in time . ”

The climbing global price of rice and other staples shows no sign of leveling off , given caps placed on exports and various supply - side squeezes .
As a result , food experts predict hunger and poverty in poor nations along with a restricted supply of grains coupled with rising prices in this country .
The worldwide rice crisis lapped over into the United States this week when Costco Wholesale and Wal - Mart 's Sam's Club , the two biggest warehouse retail chains , limited the amount of bulk imported rice customers can buy .
Sam's Club said the restriction is due to " recent supply and demand trends . "
The shortage reflects restrictions on exports by major rice producers , notably India , Vietnam and Egypt , followed on Wednesday by Brazil , causing imbalance in world markets .
These nations acted to ensure adequate domestic supplies amid rising world prices for preferable varieties of long - grain rice .
Drought has contributed to the shortage , as has hoarding , experts say .
By comparison , there is an abundance of medium - and short - grain rice planted in California , the nation 's second - largest rice - producing state after Arkansas .
California growers will harvest approximately 4 billion pounds this year , with 40 percent of the crop to be exported , the majority to Japan .
California 's product , consistently among the state 's top 20 crops , is known as sticky rice and is used in sushi , paella , risotto , sake , beer , baby food , rice milk and pet food .
Globally , the rice shortage occurring amid sharply rising food prices across the board is having enormous consequences , as rice provides more than one - fifth of all calories humans consume .
The shortage has led to food riots around the world , including deaths in Cameroon .
Protesters chanting " We 're hungry ! " caused Haiti to remove its prime minister .
" You are seeing the return of the food riot , one of the oldest forms of collective action , " said Raj Patel , a food policy specialist and visiting scholar at the UC Berkeley Center for African Studies .
He noted that the Roman statesman Cicero was once chased from his house because he had food and the intruders did n't .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
" And that happens because people do not have access to food at prices they can afford , " Patel said .
" That is why they take to the streets . "
In London this week , the executive director of the World Food Program , Josette Sheeran , warned that more than 100 million people will be pushed into poverty by a " silent tsunami " of sharply rising food prices .
" This is the new face of hunger - the millions of people who were not in the urgent hunger category six months ago but now are , " Sheeran said .
" The world 's misery index is rising . "
In this country , the big retailers seem to be the first to curtail rice sales .
Costco Wholesale said Tuesday that it is limiting quantities sold to consumers at some stores , including locations in the Bay Area .
On Wednesday , Sam's Club said it is limiting the sale of Jasmine rice from Thailand and Basmati rice from India and other imported long - grain rice to four bags per member visit .
" We are working with our suppliers to address this matter to ensure we are in stock , and we are asking for our members ' cooperation and patience , " said Kristy Reed , a Sam 's Club spokeswoman .
She said purchases of flour and oil are not restricted .
The limitations on rice are on bags that are 20 pounds or larger .
Impact on restaurants
Restaurateurs are among those who buy rice at big - box retailers .
Several in the Bay Area said they have n't raised menu prices despite their cost increases .
Sasha
Yu , an employee at Dragon River Restaurant in San Francisco , said a price increase would chase away customers .
Sam Wang , an employee at Four Seasons Restaurant in San Jose , said there are no plans to boost the $ 1 per bowl of rice price but that could change .
Patel , the author of " Stuffed & Starved : The Hidden Battle for the World Food System , " which describes a dysfunctional world food system , said he sees no reason food prices will decline .
Nor does he believe consumers will cease stockpiling in anticipation that prices will continue to rise .
The response is " an absolutely rational economic reason , " as food is almost certain to get more expensive , said Patel .
Because of restrictions on exports , drought and uncertainty about supply , " all of a sudden you are seeing the kinds of economic behavior that are normal in a market like this , " said Patel .
" When people get jumpy , they start hoarding . "
Patel lists five primary reasons for high food prices across the board :
-- Food production is heavily dependent on fossil fuel and oil prices are soaring .
--
As nations get richer they demand more meat , shifting grain " out of the bowls of the poorest people into the stomachs of livestock . "
-- Biofuel production is boosting prices .
-- Poor harvests may be the front end of climate change .
-- Speculation on food prices fuels spikes .
Beyond the limitations on rice sales by the two large U.S. retailers , Patel said he expects the crisis to increase demand for food stamps and food aid programs in this country .
" And I think we ultimately have to come to terms with the fact that meat is going to be a lot more expensive , " he said .
This will lead to a shift in diet " to a more sustainable way of eating , " he predicted , or at the least a " democratic conversation " about diet that is not currently taking place .
California alternative
Experts say it is possible rice consumers could switch to medium - grain rice like that grown in California as the crisis worsens , but they would have to overcome cultural loyalties - something not easily done .
Rice is planted on an estimated 549,000 acres in California , up from 534,000 acres last year , virtually all of it within 100 miles of the state Capitol and with a value to growers of about $ 500 million , said Tim Johnson , the president and CEO of the California Rice Commission .
Johnson said growers in the state this year will get about $ 20 per 100 pounds of rice , twice what they earned last year .
At the same time , diesel prices have increased by more than 40 percent and fertilizer has doubled in cost , he said .
" We do not know when ( the increases ) will end , and we wo n't know until it is harvest time in October , " said Johnson .
He added , " At the end of the day , the average person in California is going to buy rice for only 10 cents a serving .
From an order of magnitude that is still the best deal on the plate . "
The following is from Wrestling International Newsmagazine .
I write a column each issue for W.I.N .
Is racism present in wrestling ?
If you were one of the fans who booed after Phil Davis ' victory at 197 pounds at the Scottrade Center in St. Louis , you 'd better examine your motives .
Following Davis ' win over Central Michigan 's Wynn Michalak in the NCAA finals , Davis celebrated by beating his chest and pointing to ESPN 's overhead camera , his friend Jake Herbert and eventually to the Penn State faithful .
He was overjoyed and for obvious reasons .
Then came the boos shortly before a fan , sitting behind the press table , uttered a racial slur loud enough to project down to the press table where at least one set of ears heard it clearly .
" This is completely intolerable , " said CMU wrestling coach Tom Borrelli , regarding the racial slur .
" I do n't care what color your skin is or what race you originate from , we are all knuckleheads sometimes . "
Some fans might have thought Davis was taunting the CMU fans , who , coincidentally , were stationed in the section up and behind where the camera was positioned .
" I did n't even know where the Central Michigan fans were sitting , I was too caught up in the moment , " said Davis .
" I was too happy to care that there was booing .
Borrelli did n't see anything wrong with Davis ' celebration .
" I think he was genuinely excited and not trying to show Wynn up , even if it appeared so , " said Borrelli .
" My athletes have been told that their opponent is another human being who has worked very hard to be where he is and deserve to be treated with dignity . "
Sure , Davis started celebrating with six seconds left and nearly got taken down , which would have led to the proverbial " egg on the face . "
He might have waited until the match was officially over .
" I do n't know if it was demeaning or not , but I hope that 's not how Wynn took it , " said Davis .
" He was in on a single and I saw the clock behind him .
Four seconds , five points , I got this . "
So after someone places four times at the NCAA tournament and caps off a great career with an NCAA title , is the first thing people do is boo his celebration ? "
Stanford head coach Kerry McCoy is one of three black head coaches in Division I wrestling .
Carl Adams at Boston University and Reggie Wright at Delaware State are the other two .
" There are a lot of stupid , ignorant people , " said McCoy .
" It happens all over the place .
You 've got a black guy running for President right now and I 'm sure you 've got people out there saying the same thing about him . "
" I tend to give people the benefit of the doubt with recognizing the fact there 's a lot of non-rational people out there , " said McCoy about why people boo certain wrestlers and not others for celebrating .
" ( With Davis ) , it could be the last time he was in the finals , he did n't put on the best show . "
One of the happiest celebrations came from Coleman Scott of Oklahoma State after pinning Iowa 's Joey Slaton in the 133 - pound final .
Would the boo birds have come calling if he was black ?
There are plenty of cases where white wrestlers are booed for celebrations .
For example , Johny Hendricks was booed after his championship celebration in 2006 and Ben Askren has been booed for some of his antics , but his personality is regarded by some as " good for the sport . "
Former Oklahoma Sooner Teyon
Ware was booed in the 2003 finals after executing a backflip .
Is it OK to be flamboyant if you 're Askren , but not OK if you 're Mo Lawal ?
Is it OK if you 're Dennis Hall , but not OK if you 're T.C. Dantzler ?
Is it fine if you 're Rulon Gardner , but not fine if you 're Daniel Cormier ?
This is n't about gamesmanship , such as Mark Perry blowing kisses to the Missouri crowd .
It 's about a celebration .
As an athlete , McCoy won two NCAA titles at heavyweight and was a member of the 2004 and 2008 U.S. Olympic teams .
Was he ever met with similar experiences ?
" If it happened , I did n't notice , " said McCoy .
" I did n't pay much attention to it . "
Lawal noticed , starting back in high school .
" I remember I beat this kid from West Texas .
He was undefeated and I only had six matches .
It was a big win for me , " said Lawal .
" I was running off the mat excited because it was a huge upset and his mother came down from the stands and ( used a racial slur ) . "
Internationally , Lawal 's celebration 's are n't met with the chorus of boos he typically gets in the United States .
" People booed here when I beat Lee Fullhart , " he said .
" But overseas , they love the celebrations .
They like you because you 're good , not because you 're black , white , or whatever .
They do n't see color overseas . "
McCoy keeps an even keel on the subject , but does n't think it 's all based on the action of celebrating .
" I do n't think it was 100 percent because ( Davis ) was black , " said McCoy .
" But I would n't think it 's impossible either . "
" For me , it 's been a long time coming , " said Davis , a native of Harrisburg , Pa . .
" I never made it to the state finals .
I made it to the national finals ( in 2006 ) and lost ( to Oklahoma State 's Jake Rosholt ) .
I made it back and finally got the big win .
I accomplished what I really wanted to .
That was the expression coming out of me . "
" It 's hard to figure how someone can perceive you when you 're winning , " said Davis .
But Davis , infectious grin and all , has somewhat of a different theory .
" I think the crowd designates the good guy and a bad guy for every weight .
Some people remember me in 2006 as the guy in the finals who punched ( Jake ) Rosholt ' . "
" Maybe that makes me inherently the bad guy , " Davis said .
" They did n't see me get poked in the eye then or this year when I had to get my eye super - glued shut . "
Does Davis feel his " bad guy " perception is sometimes racially motivated ?
" It does have a component to it , but I 'm not sure how it manifests itself in how you get booed , " said Davis .
While celebrations are n't limited to some racial questions , McCoy does notice discussions about black wrestlers being considered " athletic , " whereas a white wrestler hitting the same move would be considered as having " great technique . "
" Certain people fit a certain mold .
If you 're not over the top , you 're not seen as black .
You 're just seen as another guy , " said McCoy .
" It 's a type of discrimination ; not necessarily hurtful , but it 's one of those things where a lot of times you get , ' You 're not black , ' or ' I was n't talking about you , I was talking about other black people . ' "
" I 've heard that so much , " said Lawal .
" Oh , he 's quick , fast and athletic .
" Lee Kemp is one of the most technical wrestlers I 've ever worked with and all everyone talks about is how athletic he was or how strong he was .
They did n't talk about Melvin Douglas ' technique .
They talked about how fast he was . "
Lawal feels he does n't need to censor his emotions .
" When a white person celebrates , he deserves it , he worked hard , " said Lawal .
" If a black wrestler celebrates , he 's classless and flamboyant .
" I 've been told to be quiet and not do anything , but that 's not me .
Raise your hand , wave to the crowd and bow and walk off the stage ?
It 's not that easy , it 's emotional .
I just do what I love doing . "
If it 's fine for one race , it should be fine for another .

Red and blue strobes explode in your mirrors .
You pull to the side of the road and madly begin fishing through the glove box for your registration and insurance .
Then you tear off the seatbelt so you can jam a hand down your pants to locate your wallet .
Just trying to be courteous , right ?
You know , have all your documents ready when The Man strolls up to your window .
Turns out , most cops do n’t want you to do anything except rest your hands on top of the steering wheel until directed otherwise .
Did n’t know that , did you ?
Neither did we .
We talked to seven state troopers from across the country — Florida , New Jersey , Kentucky , Louisiana , Illinois , Oregon , and New Mexico — and asked , “ What are the five best things a motorist can do when pulled over , and what are the five worst ? ”
We wanted to know which procedures would render a traffic stop as painless as possible for both parties .
There was n’t a perfect consensus , but the answers went pretty much like this :
FIVE BEST THINGS TO DO
1 . Pull to the right at the first safe opportunity , then turn off your engine .
If it ’s not a safe place to stop , Oregon ’s Lt. Gregg Hastings wants you to activate your right - turn signal , then drive slowly to a safer place .
“ A safer place , by the way , is n’t a considerable distance down a dark side road , driveway , or alley , ” he says .
“ Keep in mind that traffic - related officer deaths jumped 16 percent in 2006 , ” Hastings adds .
2. Stay in your car with your seatbelt fastened .
Roll down your window .
Turn off the radio .
Do n’t even think about touching your cell phone .
“ When a motorist climbs out of his vehicle , ” says New Jersey ’s Sgt. Stephen Jones , “ it may give the impression he ’s aggressive or has something to hide in the vehicle .
I remember a man who briskly walked back to my car .
I ordered him back , and he kept trying to give me his credentials at the rear of his car .
The source of his consternation was two marijuana plants partly under a cloth in his back seat . ”
“ I pulled over a guy in a Jeep CJ , and he exited his vehicle , ” recalls New Mexico ’s Lt. Richard Anglada .
“ That ’s when I realized his Jeep was rolling back toward my brand - new police car .
Summoning all my strength , I had to hold his Jeep from rolling while I told him to set his brake — another reason we want people to stay in their cars . ”
“ Roll down your window completely , ” adds Sergeant Jones .
“ Nothing ’s more frustrating than trying to speak through a slightly cracked window .
If you only give me an inch - wide gap , you hinder my ability to determine your sobriety and are more likely to be invited to continue the conversation outside your car . ”
If you do n’t leave your seatbelt on , the officer may also assume you were driving unbelted , thus another ticket .
There are exceptions to the stay - in - your - car rule , however .
“ We always ask the driver to exit the vehicle with his license , registration , and proof of insurance , ” says Louisiana Trooper Johnnie Brown .
What if you ’re not sure whether to stay put or climb out ?
“ Just sit still , ” Brown says , “ and it wo n’t be long before we ’ll tell you what we want . ”
3 . Place your hands on top of the steering wheel and sit quietly .
Ask passengers to remain silent .
“ Whatever dangers we face , they will be channeled through the hands , ” says Sergeant Jones .
“ We ’d like to see the hands of every person in the car , frankly . ”
Although they do n’t insist on it , Lieutenant Hastings , as well as most other troopers , greatly prefer that you tell them where you ’re about to reach .
“ It puts me at ease if you say , ‘ I ’m going to reach for my wallet now , ’ ” he says , “ or , ‘ I need to open the glove box , okay ? ’ ”
4. Retrieve license , registration , and proof of insurance only when asked to do so .
Illinois M.Sgt.
Luis Gutierrez appreciates it if you turn on your four - way flashers and your interior lights , especially at night .
And Lieutenant Hastings strongly advises that you know where your documents are before you ’re stopped .
“ If you start fumbling around , it suggests the car may not be yours , or that you may not have a license , or that you ’re hoping the officer wo n’t see what you ’ve hidden in the car , ” he says .
“ And when you find your documents , do n’t throw them at me . ”
“ I find it funny when a driver is reluctant to open his glove box , usually because he does n’t want me to see what ’s in there , ” says Lieutenant Anglada .
“ He ’ll open it as slowly as possible to avoid anything falling out .
From my vantage , I usually see the contraband before he does . ”
Adds Florida Trooper Larry Coggins , “ A traffic stop is not the time to clean out your car , sorting through 10 years ’ worth of registrations and insurance cards .
Also , tell me immediately if you have a gun [ legal or otherwise ] anywhere on you or in the vehicle . ”
“ Never reach under your seat , ” adds Sergeant Jones , “ and never reach into the passenger area . ”
“ I stopped a motorist for speeding , and he was a security guard , ” remembers Trooper Brown .
“ He exited the vehicle with his service revolver on his side .
I made him place his hands on his head , then removed the weapon from his holster , removed the bullets , and placed the revolver separate from the bullets in the passenger compartment .
Any weapon — gun , knife , pepper spray , whatever — tell me first . ”
5 . Answer questions succinctly .
Avoid arguing , cursing , or interrupting when the officer speaks to you .
“ Do n’t assert your disgust about traffic laws , ” suggests Trooper Coggins .
“ There ’s nothing we can do about the laws , and the side of the highway is no place to argue your case .
Save it for court . ”
“ Arguing with a trooper about speed , ” says Sergeant Jones , “ is like spitting into the wind . ”
“ Be civil , ” advises Trooper Brown .
“ I stopped a pizza - delivery vehicle for 60 mph in a 45 zone .
The driver told me to hurry up , that he had a pizza to deliver in 30 minutes or less .
I asked for registration and proof of insurance , and he did n’t have either .
I informed him I ’d have to tow his vehicle for not having the required paperwork .
He began to curse at me .
After a brief inspection of the vehicle , he received seven tickets . ”
FIVE WORST THINGS TO DO
1 . Do n’t slam on your brakes when you see the flashing lights , and do n’t continue driving for an extended distance .
“ At times , those actions are perceived as intentional , ” says Lieutenant Hastings .
“ They just place an officer on edge . ”
2 . Do not jump out of the vehicle , do not make any sudden movements , and do not approach the officer .
“ I pulled over a ’ 60s - model Chevy truck one night , ” recalls Lieutenant Anglada , “ and the driver gets out and is running toward my car with his hands wrapped in a blanket .
I feared he was concealing a weapon .
So I drew my side arm and ordered him to show me his hands .
Turned out that his old truck did n’t have a heater — he was freezing . ”
“ Motorists should try to put themselves in my place , ” suggests Trooper Coggins .
“ Just because I stopped a guy for speeding , it still runs through my mind that he might be fleeing a crime scene , might be a wanted fugitive , impaired , a kidnapper with a body in the trunk , a carjacker who has n’t been called in yet — I just do n’t know . ”
3 . You can complain , you can proffer wild explanations , but not for long .
Lieutenant Anglada claims way too often to have heard the excuse , “ I was speeding because I had to go to the bathroom . ”
He recalls a woman who used that justification , then exited her car .
“ She asked if I ’d hold a blanket around her while she squatted to relieve herself , ” Anglada recalls .
“ I advised her to stroll off into the bushes while I waited .
She still got the ticket .
Over the years , officers develop an excellent ear for sincerity . ”
“ We stress to our troopers not to issue ‘ attitude tickets , ’ ” says Lieutenant Hastings .
“ But we can take only so much complaining before we ’ve heard enough . ”
4 . Do not lie .
If you were speeding , admit it .
If you honestly have no clue why you were stopped , wait for the officer to tell you .
“ There ’s no substitute for frankness , but often we just see freakiness , ” says Sergeant Jones .
“ Do n’t respond with , ‘ Why ’d you stop me ?
Do n’t you have criminals to catch ? ’
That ’s a sure - fire way to receive justice rather than mercy .
And think again if you believe you ’ve come up with an excuse for speeding that we have n’t heard . ”
“ If people are honest and admit they ’re wrong , ” says Lieutenant Anglada , “ 90 percent of the time I ’ll drop their speed or just give them a warning .
If the person lies or accuses the officer of being wrong , 99 percent of the time the driver is going to get the ticket with no break . ”
5 . Do not show your contempt by peeling away after the stop .
Says Lieutenant Hastings , “ Squealing your tires , tossing gravel at me , cutting off other motorists as you pull back on the highway — that ’ll get you another several minutes with the same officer who just stopped you . ”

There is a war raging in this graceful old city of colorful cathedrals , lush parks and cobblestone byways .
It ’s a clanging , banging fight that threatens to slice up grassy gardens , overshadow the onion domes , break the sleepy slopes of rolling hills .
An epidemic of quasi-legal construction and shadowy land grabs is chewing on the ancient capital on the banks of the Dnieper River .
Roughly 60 “ scandal construction zones , ” as the mayor ’s office calls them , have turned Kiev ’s postage - stamp - sized downtown into a free - for - all of spanking - new skyscrapers , shady land acquisitions , grass - roots protests and fast - talking investors .
“ We are witnessing the murder of a 1,000 - year - old city , ” said Maryna Solovjova , a lawyer who has fought to halt construction in the midst of a UNESCO - protected hilltop in the heart of the city .
Who ’s responsible ?
Just about everybody blames the city government .
But the mayor ’s office accuses the former mayor and the courts .
The prime minister ’s bloc blames the city government , the president , the courts and just about anybody else -- except themselves .
The president complains about the “ rot and corruption ” of the land deals , but appears helpless .

The fight over Kiev is an apt symbol of the state of the country ’s leadership .
Some Ukrainians say the debasement of the capital city , the spiritual heart of the nation , is a daily reminder that years of revolution and a fierce fight for democracy have somehow failed to deliver the clean government they had envisioned .
“ It is n’t just buildings .
This is a social issue , and buildings are just the visible part of the iceberg , ” said Artem Chapeye , a 26 - year - old activist who has joined raucous demonstrations to halt some of the construction projects .
“ We were hoping for more democracy .
But there ’s a small group of people in charge , and they do n’t listen to anybody . ”
Priced out of downtown by ballooning rents and watching the picturesque neighborhoods morph before their eyes , disgruntled residents describe a feeling of helplessness to preserve the town they describe as Europe ’s greenest capital .
With anger rising and land being gobbled up , an irate parliament called for an early mayoral election this month .

As 79 candidates scrap for votes , some of the most controversial building projects have been frozen without explanation , leading many residents to mutter that the officials who claim innocence can evidently halt the construction when it ’s politically convenient .
Take , for example , plans to build atop what is said to be a medieval burial ground for plague victims .
Or consider the idea of constructing a luxury high - rise in the heart of “ Landscape Alley , ” once the hilltop home to the princes of Kievan Rus , and then distributing the apartments free of charge to government bureaucrats .
Both projects were steaming forward , and both have now been halted .
Climb up to Landscape Alley , past the home of author Mikhail Bulgakov and the turquoise spires of the church of St. Andrew .
From the top of the hill , the city spreads out below .

These days , yellow cranes rear up against the backdrop of fairy - tale hills .
The metallic clang and roar of drills and jackhammers slice through birdsong in the morning air .
But at an abandoned construction site , graffiti spray - painted on a fence announces : “ The construction was stopped by the people of Kiev . ”
Like many of his peers , Chapeye took to the streets in 2004 demonstrations that captivated international imagination and ushered President Viktor Yushchenko into power .
Today , he and his friends use that experience , with the help of the Internet , to stage demonstrations against deals cut by people they helped elevate into office .
“ The state itself is destroying the city , so we have to fight with our own fists , ” Chapeye said .
“ The bulldozers come and we fight . ”

“ Land is a bribe here , ” said Andriy Pavlovsky , a lawmaker with Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko ’s bloc .
“ The people in power in Kiev are giving out land to their relatives , waiting for a couple of years so it gets more expensive and then selling the land .
There is a pyramid of corruption .
They bribe the police and especially the prosecutors , so everybody comes out clean . ”
The mayor ’s office acknowledges that the city is being sliced to pieces , but claims that bribes were paid and permits illegally obtained under the previous mayor ’s administration .
The city ’s attempts to halt the construction have been flouted by the courts , city officials say .
“ It ’s a wild situation , ” said Denys Komarnytsky , head of the mayor ’s bloc on the City Council .
“ The City Hall tells the investors they ca n’t build anything in the illegal construction areas , ” he said .
“ Then they go to the courts and get the courts to deny the decision of City Hall . ”
Facts are short , innuendoes long -- and time may be running out .

“ If the situation continues like this for another 10 years , we will lose Kiev , ” said Vitaly Portnikov , a political commentator for Radio Liberty in Kiev .
“ The politicians play the fool , ” he said .
“ Their main goal is to procrastinate until the construction is finished and nothing can be changed .
You can never find out who is really in charge and who is really responsible . ”

Swedish Silver 9 - Year - Old Boy Finds $ 265,000 Medieval Treasure Trove
A nine - year - old Swedish boy and his grandfather have found a hoard of 13th - century coins while treasure hunting on a battlefield .
Just the silver in the coins alone is estimated to be worth a whopping $ 265,000 .
From Newsday.com :
Latest Clinton tactic :
Fake news reports
The Clinton campaign ’s latest tactic in Ohio is , apparently , a radio ad that tries to make listeners think it ’s a news report until the very end .
Stuff like this , if it succeeds in fooling voters , fairly seriously pollutes the information environment by trying to steal the credibility of the news media and use it to present a biased , exaggerated set of facts .
Why ca n’t we rely on people who want to be president to not engage in the kind of creepy behavior that you teach your kids not to do ?
Sen . Ron Wyden ( D - OR ) stepped in front of a group of tech executives in Washington this morning to deliver a caffeinated and surprisingly sharp defense of network neutrality .
Pledging to use " every ounce of my energy to protect network neutrality , " Wyden had a message for ISPs who might be pondering new charges for various forms of access : " think twice . "
If ISPs start down that road , they might soon find that they lose key legal protections including " safe harbors " and tax freedom .
Wyden delivered his ultimatum at a Computer & Communications Industry Association conference in DC , where he cast the entire network neutrality debate in terms of a legislative compromise .
Years ago , Congress began protecting ISPs from the twin threats of regulation and taxation ; in return , ISPs were expected to deliver an unimpeded connection to the Internet .
A move away from a neutral ' Net would undermine the " very philosophical underpinnings of what we fought for for the last 15 years , " according to Wyden .
If that happens , he sees no reason for Congress to continue sheltering ISPs .
Ron Wyden
The two specific pieces of legislation encompassed by this threat are the Communications Decency Act and the Internet Tax Freedom Act .
While much of the CDA was tossed out by a federal judge on the grounds that it unconstitutionally limited free speech , section 230 of the act survived .
230 provided a safe harbor to ISPs and web sites , exempting them from liability for content posted to or through them , a provision that benefits Ars and every other website that allows user - generated content and comments .
The law saved ISPs " vast sums , " according to Wyden .
The Internet Tax Freedom
Act has also kept most taxes from being applied to Internet connections , even though states have repeatedly shown interest in taxing these links .
In return for helping out ISPs , what did Congress get in return ?
" Monopolies , " according to Wyden , or , in other cases , duopolies where one or two main gatekeepers controlled access to the ' Net for most US citizens .
Wyden 's rhetoric grew downright militant as he contemplated the various ways that these ISPs might start hitting consumers with fees .
" The sword cuts both ways , " he said , implying that the ISPs might find themselves having to collect more taxes and pay for more litigation if they continue to agitate Congress by pondering or implementing non-neutral fees .
Part of the reason that the issue gets so much traction is because network neutrality has become one of those wonky crossover issues that stirs up passions even among normal ' Net users .
Rep. Anna Eshoo ( D - CA ) , speaking at the same event , issued a reminder of how much popular traction the idea has gained : when she goes into high school classrooms , the kids " ask me about ' Net neutrality , " she said .
With Rep. Ed Markey ( D - MA ) holding an important network neutrality hearing this morning in the House , Eshoo expressed her confidence that Markey 's bill would be taken up by Congress but that it would face a serious challenge on the House floor .
Should it fail there , " I think the Capitol would fall down around members ' ears if the opposition were successful , " she said .
Rep. Mike Doyle ( D - PA ) agreed with Eshoo and noted that the two sides are separated by what now seems to be " almost a religious difference . "
Doyle chalks up some of the antagonism to a generational divide , as the only people of his generation who grew up using the Internet were the people who invented it .
' Net neutrality is n't a " wild plan to destroy the Internet , " Doyle continued , arguing that a younger generation brought up using the Internet understands exactly what 's at stake .
Or , as FCC Commissioner Jonathan Adelstein put it later in the day , " Anyone who messes with the open Internet does so at their peril . "
Swords , peril , wild plans , and a crumbling Capitol ; all we need are wild animals in the streets and possibly a rider on a pale horse for the network neutrality debate to officially complete its ascendancy from a network management issue to a millenarian apocalyptic battle cry .
Despite the rhetoric on this issue , it looks unlikely that Congress will actually take any action this year .
What kind of relationship do Americans want to build with the world 's 6 billion other people in the years ahead ?
This question is urgent , since the past seven years have seen an unprecedented drop in our country 's global favorability rating .
In today 's hyper - connected world , that has huge consequences for Washington 's ability to protect American interests .
To fix this problem , many experts – and even the presidential candidates – are promoting agendas to rebuild America 's position of world leadership .
They are right to try to repair our image abroad .
But their focus on " American leadership " is misplaced .
A smarter approach would be for us to build a new relationship with the world that embraces the key principles of human equality and mutual respect among all peoples .
Starting to see themselves as " merely " equal to everyone else may seem slightly scary to some Americans .
But history should assure them .
I grew up in a Great Britain that was making a broadly similar shift : from the days of the globe - girdling " British Empire " to a situation in which it was just one , though still quite powerful , nation among many .
That change was warmly welcomed by the citizens of the many countries that won their independence from London .
But as I explain in my upcoming book , " Re-engage !
America and the World After Bush , " it ended up being very good for the British , too .
As any recent visitor can attest , today 's Britain is humming and successful .
Here 's another imperfect ( but also helpful ) comparison .
America 's current relationship with the rest of humanity has much in common with that between South Africa 's apartheid - era whites and their disfranchised non-white compatriots .
Back then , most white South Africans argued that they were more civilized and more educated than the others ; thus it was " best for everyone concerned " if they dominated national decision - making .
A far - fetched analogy ?
Perhaps .
But there are echoes of that mentality in the way some Americans still talk about Washington 's role in global affairs .
And the end of the apartheid story really is a hopeful one !
After fighting for centuries to maintain control , the whites finally sat down to talk with – and just as important , listen to – the African National Congress leaders .
In the process , they found that those others were willing to work with them in building a new order built on equality and nonviolent problem solving .
What would it mean , today , if Americans started to think and act as though all of humanity constituted a single community , with us as just one part of it ?
Are we ready to seek out and give fair weight to the views of the citizens of other countries on matters that affect everyone ?
Climate change is an area in which we urgently need to adopt this approach .
The current Bali conference negotiations give us a window to reach a fair international agreement on reducing climate - wrecking emissions .
But what does " fairness " entail ?
We cannot ask emerging countries such as China or India simply to forgo the economic growth that has brought such benefit to Americans and Europeans for 150 years now .
Chinese and Indian leaders have already declared that unacceptable .
Instead , we must work together to negotiate emissions caps that may be painful in the short run , but give us all the time and the tools we need to transform our economies into ones the Earth can sustain .
Treating the peoples of other countries as our true equals is the American way .
In the Declaration of Independence , the Founders held it self - evident that " all men " ( meaning " all men and women " ) were created equal – not just " all US citizens . "
Then , in the 1940s , American leaders were visionary in creating the United Nations and the bodies associated with it .
These institutions embody the values of human equality and nonviolent problem solving .
Yes , they 're flawed .
But they can be reformed .
And they stand today as a supreme achievement of their American creators .
In a world built more truly on principles of equality , might US interests get swamped by the hostile and dictatorial tendencies of China or other emerging nations ?
Such a fear is exaggerated ( and harmful ) .
The US has several important protections for its independence : its geographical sturdiness ; the UN 's principles of non-aggression and respect for state sovereignty ; and , at the military level , its continuing deterrent power .
Consider , too , what happened in the cases of the British Empire and South Africa .
After decades of colonial bloodshed , all those once - fearful leaders finally realized that if you offer respect and equality to other people , then they will accord it back to you .
There is certainly a lesson there !
Today , America 's relationship with the world 's 6 billion non-Americans is more vital to our wellbeing than ever before .
Let 's work on making it the most constructive relationship we can .
• Helena Cobban , a former Monitor correspondent , is a " Friend in Washington " with the Friends Committee on National Legislation .
Her latest book is " Re-engage : America and the World After Bush . "
There 's a characteristically brilliant Peanuts strip which opens with Linus sitting on the living room floor , anxiously clutching his mouth .
Lucy enters and asks what 's wrong .
" I 'm aware of my tongue , " he explains .
" It 's an awful feeling !
Every now and then I become aware that I have a tongue inside my mouth , and then it starts to feel lumped up ... I can't help it ... I can't put it out of my mind ...
I keep thinking about where my tongue would be if I were n't thinking about it , and then I can feel it sort of pressing against my teeth . "
Loudly declaring this the dumbest thing she 's ever heard , Lucy scowls away .
But a few steps down the corridor , she stops dead in her tracks .
She clutches her own mouth .
Suddenly she 's aware of her tongue too .
She runs back and chases him round the room , shouting , " You blockhead ! " with her gigantic booming gob .
Occasionally , late at night , while trying to sleep and failing , I experience something similar - except instead of being aware of my tongue , I 'm aware of my entire body , the entire world , and the whole of reality itself .
It 's like waking from a dream , or a light going on , or a giant " YOU ARE HERE " sign appearing in the sky .
The mere fact that I 'm actually real and actually breathing suddenly hits me in the head with a thwack .
It leaves me giddy .
It causes a brief surge of clammy , bubbling anxiety , like the opening stages of a panic attack .
The moment soon passes , but while it lasts it 's strangely terrifying .
I asked around and discovered to my that relief I 'm not the only one .
Many of my friends have experienced something similar and have been equally spooked .
One of them , a smartarse , pointed out that Jean - Paul Sartre was so rattled by the sensation that he was inspired to write an entire book about existential dread called Nausea , which became a student classic .
I prefer Charles M Schulz 's take .
It 's far more succinct and comes with funny pictures .
Anyway , what troubles me about such moments of heightened awareness is n't the dizzying headrush that accompanies them , but the implication that the rest of the time I must be essentially asleep , cruising around on autopilot , scarcely even aware that I 'm alive .
Here , but not here .
Like I 'm watching a TV show .
That 's the bulk of my life .
I might as well set the video and nod off completely , catching up later while eating a takeaway dinner .
I did n't mention this to my smartarse friend - but if I had , they 'd doubtless point out that Kurt Vonnegut was so rattled by this sensation that he was inspired to write an entire book about it .
In his 1997 novel Timequake , a bizarre rift in time sends everyone on Earth back 10 years - but only in spirit .
Trapped inside their own heads , mere spectators , they 're forced to watch themselves living their day - to - day lives for an entire decade , making the same mistakes , experiencing the same joys and heartaches - and they 're powerless to intervene .
Naturally , they get bored and drift off , leaving themselves on autopilot .
At the moment the timequake eventually ends , and they 're back in the present day , most of them simply drop to the floor , confused - it 's been so long since they were at the controls , they 've forgotten how to walk and talk for themselves .
That 's the stuff of science fiction , but it increasingly applies to our everyday lives .
The gap between your stupid face and cold hard reality is increasing all the time .
We plod down the street holding remote conversations with voices in little plastic boxes .
We slump in front of hi-def panels watching processed , graded , synchronised imagery .
We wander through made - up online worlds , pausing occasionally to chew the fat with some blue - skinned tit in a jester 's hat .
We watch time and space collapse on a daily basis .
Our world is now running an enhanced , expanded version of reality 's vanilla operating system .
As a result , it 's all too easy to feel like a viewer of - rather than a participant in - your own life .
And living at one remove can be crippling .
You spend more time internally criticising your own actions , like a snarky stoner ripping the piss out of a bad movie , than actually knuckling down and doing stuff .
All of which means that those late - night moments of lurching fear , of existential nausea , of basic " I 'm alive ! " horror now feel more extreme than ever .
The gap has widened .
Our sleep is deeper .
We 're like mesmerised rabbits .
That explains why we fail to do anything in the face of mounting dangers .
We 've done piss - all about global warming , the Bush administration , and Piers Morgan 's rising media profile - each of which has the potential to destroy us all - because we hardly know we 're born .
That 's my theory anyway .
Clearly , the only solution is for us to set about smashing up every single machine in the world , before we nod off completely .
Yeah .
That 's the best conclusion I can draw at present .
Because I did n't set out to write a weird existential column this morning , but hey : I 'm fast asleep myself .
Sue me when you wake up .

A new study from Leibniz University Hannover finds that the 1/3 of German professional fund managers who believe human biases to be important in financial markets have better calibrated estimates and rely more on momentum and contrarian strategies , but otherwise think and act like other fund managers :
[ A ] literature in psychology … has clearly revealed the " bias blind spot " ( Pronin et al. , 2002 ) , i.e. the belief that one ’s own judgments are less susceptible to biases than the judgments of others .
… [ Among ] professional … fund managers we differentiate … " endorsers " of behavioral finance … [ who ] believe that the approach of behavioral finance truly reflects decision behavior in fund management ( and who know the key messages of behavioral finance well ) … [ and ] non-endorsers . …
We have surveyed [ 104 ] fund managers in Germany and classify them according to their self - assessment into these two groups .
…
Whereas [ the 37 ] endorsers recognize significantly stronger behavioral finance effects in other fund managers ’ behavior than non-endorsers , the perception of their own behavior is largely unaffected by their insights .
When endorsers ’ are asked about their own behavior with respect to items being linked to behavioral finance , such as hindsight bias or disposition effect , they answer as non-endorsers do .
However , there is one exception … Endorsers show less miscalibration with respect to forecasting the interval of a stock index . …
We [ also ] find … endorsers rely more on momentum and contrarian [ versus buy - and - hold ] strategies .
…
Endorsement … is not closely related to personal characteristics , such as being older or holding a better position etc .
Even for those with strong incentives to correct for biases , knowing about and believing in biases has influenced their decisions little , and not obviously to their benefit .
This suggests that we focus not on trying to correct our personal biases but instead on identifying and promoting institutions , such as prediction markets , to reduce biases .

Pentagon 's Debt Collectors Accused of Ripping Off Soldiers Military deducted money from members ' benefits or tax refunds , suit says .
April 4 , 2008  -- U.S. soldiers and veterans have been illegally hit up by Pentagon debt collectors for millions of dollars in payments over military credit card debt , according to the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen .
" It is shocking that a U.S. government agency would illegally take this money from veterans who have served our country well , " said Deepak Gupta of Public Citizen .
Public Citizen and consumer lawyers have filed a class - action lawsuit against the Army and Air Force Exchange Services ( AAFES ) , which issues credit cards to U.S. service members to buy goods at military stores .
The suit alleges that AAFES improperly took money from military credit card users for expired debt and inflated penalties and fees .
Unlike civilian debt collectors who use phone calls and letters to try to collect payment , the military simply deducted the money from service members ' government benefits or tax refunds , the suit contends .
" To take away these benefits because of old debt incurred during military service to buy things like uniforms and equipment is outrageous , " said Gupta .
Lead plaintiff Julius Briggs , a veteran of Operation Desert Storm , said that AAFES illegally withheld more than $ 2,300 from his disability payments .
According to the suit , Briggs ' debt was too old to collect , and AAFES also hit him up with inflated interest rates and penalty fees .
Briggs claims the withheld money caused him to miss his housing payments , leaving him temporarily homeless .
The suit charges that AAFES has illegally appropriated millions of dollars from thousands of service members over the years .
The U.S. Department of Justice lawyer defending the case declined comment , but the government has moved to have the suit dismissed on sovereign immunity grounds .
At the U.S. District Court in San Francisco this week , plaintiffs ' attorneys argued the case should go forward .
" With any luck , this lawsuit will force AAFES to stop collecting money that it has no right to take , " said Briggs .

Lisa Schiffren at the Corner , perfect representative of the modern GOP :
Obama and I are roughly the same age .
I grew up in liberal circles in New York City — a place to which people who wished to rebel against their upbringings had gravitated for generations .
And yet , all of my mixed race , black / white classmates throughout my youth , some of whom I am still in contact with , were the product of very culturally specific unions .
They were always the offspring of a white mother , ( in my circles , she was usually Jewish , but elsewhere not necessarily ) and usually a highly educated black father .
And how had these two come together at a time when it was neither natural nor easy for such relationships to flourish ?
Always through politics .
No , not the young Republicans .
Usually the Communist Youth League .
Or maybe a different arm of the CPUSA .
But , for a white woman to marry a black man in 1958 , or 60 , there was almost inevitably a connection to explicit Communist politics .

meltさんのところで 僕らは技術力よりも第一印象で能力を判断されている／Ｔｅｃｈ総研が取り上げられていたけども、
Tech総研の記事 は 「 人は見た目が9割」という話ではないように思います。
確かに足切りのタイミングは早い
「 その１ 人はどのタイミングで能力を判断しているのか？」では
エンジニアの解答 非エンジニアの解答 会って数分話をし て 28 % 29 % 1回のミーティングで 18 % 13 % 数回のミーティングとやり取りで 24 % 20 %
という数字が出されています。 エンジニアは 「 会って数分話をして 」
「1回のミーティングで」で併せて46%となりますね。
半数近くがこの程度の少ないやりとりで能力を判断していると答えているわけです。
これでは、じっくり時間をかけて相手の腕を吟味しているとは言えません。
その短いやり取りで何をチェックしているのでしょうか。
「 その２ 初対面では相手のどこをチェックしている？ 」
を見ると、エンジニア/非エンジニアで大きく数値が違う箇所がひとつあります。
「話の内容」でエンジニアは30%、非エンジニアは15%と答えています。
我々エンジニアが相手を見る際は、話の内容で相手の技術の程度を測ろうとしているのです。
これは、対面での会話でもBBSやメールでの遣り取りでも、blogを読む時もそう。
エンジニアなんてのは技術があってなんぼの世界ですから、自然、技術力によるヒエラルキーができてしまいます。
もちろん、技術にはいろいろな指向性がありますから、専門を外れれば素人同然。
ですから方向は違えど深みがある人は敬われるわけですね。
そんな我々エンジニアですが、会って数分話をすれば論理的な思考ができているか/いないかに
当りをつけることができるわけです。 エンジニアは話の端々に高度に専門的な、技術に対する見解を含めているから、
それらを解している/いない、なんらかの見識を持っている/いないが数度の会話の往復で測れてしまう。
だから、 「 技術力よりも第一印象 」 なのではなく、「 第一印象の技術力 」 で相手を判断していると言えましょう。
第一印象というのは写真のことではない
このように、技術屋の第一印象というのはビジュアル面ではありません。
不精な感じとか、服装のダサさとかは技術力の測定にはまず影響しない。
( 人としてどうかと思うぐらいになると技術者云々以前に人として付き合いたくないでしょうけども)
技術者を書類審査でふるいにかけるなら写真は不要です。
写真で技術力なんてこれっぽっちもわかりはしない。
先に挙げたように、技術者は相手と面した時に、話の内容を重視する傾向が強いわけです。
デバッグ時に関数の挙動を確認するかのように、知識があれば帰ってくるだろう反応、
ロジカルシンキングが出来ていれば帰ってくるだろう反応、
見識があれば帰ってくるだろう反応を確かめていきます。
そういう探りを入れていくことで、「会って数分話をして」人をかなり判断できてしまう。
論理が破たんしている人間をふるい落とすのは容易いし、精度だってそれほど悪くはない。
我々は思っているよりも第一印象で能力を測定できているわけです。
中身を見ずに判断しているわけじゃない。そこはもっと自信を持っていいのではないでしょうか。

1,000 IDEAS FOR ESL CLASSES : Breaking News English.com 's e-Book THE ARTICLE Bhutan practices for first ever election Citizens of the remote Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan cast their ballots for the first time in their country ’s history on Saturday .
Bhutanese residents voted in “ dummy ” elections , designed as a warm - up for real elections in 2008 .
Bhutan ’s government wanted a test run to teach its people about the basics of democracy .
Election authorities are happy with the voter turnout and said everything went smoothly .
“ The elections will give us a chance to evaluate our readiness for holding the big elections , ” an official said .
People were given mock manifestos to look at and had to vote for one of four fake political parties  the Blue , Red , Green , or Yellow Thunder Dragon Parties .
A second round of polling will take place on May 28th to decide between the first and second - place winners of Saturday ’s contest .
An estimated 400,000 people are eligible to vote in the tiny rooftop nation , sandwiched between India and China .
In the real elections , people will vote for a new parliament that may put an end to the rule of the monarchy and end a century of royal rule .
However , it is unclear from Saturday ’s dress rehearsal how the real thing will go .
Although people considered issues such as the environment , industrial development and traditional values , the deciding factor came down to the voters ’ favourite colour .
The overwhelming winner , with around 44 percent of the vote , was the Yellow Thunder Dragon Party , which called for the preservation of Bhutan 's traditions , cultures and values .
This is consistent with the nation ’s view that its GDH ( Gross Domestic Happiness ) is more important than its GDP ( Gross Domestic Product ) .

Cate Blanchett plays a Soviet Communist villain in the new film
Members of the Russian Communist party have called for the new Indiana Jones film to be banned in the country because they say it distorts history .
Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull , set during the Cold War , sees Harrison Ford 's character battle Cate Blanchett 's evil KGB agent .
St Petersburg Communist Party chief Sergei Malinkovich told the Reuters news agency it was " rubbish " .
" Why should we agree to that sort of lie and let the West trick our youth ? "
He said many Russian cinemagoers were teenagers who would be " completely unaware of what happened in 1957 " , when the film is set .
" They will go to the cinema and will be sure that in 1957 we made trouble for the United States and almost started a nuclear war .
" It 's rubbish ...
In 1957 the communists did not run with crystal skulls throughout the US . "
The Associated Press news agency quoted Moscow Communist official Andrei Andreyev as saying : " It is very disturbing if talented directors want to provoke a new Cold War . "
Matthew Sinor was in his second year of law school at Ohio State a couple of years ago when he heard that an Army buddy had gotten into trouble with the law .
Mr. Sinor rescheduled two exams and flew to Mobile , Ala. , to make sure nothing went awry at his friend ’s sentencing hearing .
The defendant , Sgt. Patrick Lett , had served 17 years in the Army , including two tours in Iraq , and he had pleaded guilty in federal court to selling cocaine .
It was up to Judge William H. Steele , a former marine , to decide how to punish him .
“ I do n’t normally see people standing before me in uniform , ” Judge Steele said .
Sergeant Lett ’s commanding officer , Capt .
Michael Iannuccilli , testified that the man he knew was “ a patriot , father and a good man . ”
“ I would gladly deploy to Iraq with him and entrust my life to him , ” Captain Iannuccilli said .
“ I ’d trust my soldiers ’ lives to him .
He ’s been nothing but an exemplary soldier . ”

Carlyle Capital shares were listed in Amsterdam in July 2007
The US mortgage - backed bond fund will collapse if , as expected , its lenders seize its remaining assets .
CCC 's problems are the latest sign of the credit market turmoil that has prompted billions of dollars of losses at some of the world 's biggest banks .
Other investment funds may now face similar problems , analysts fear .
In the past year , global banks and hedge funds have been buying mortgage - backed securities , which offered strong returns and were seen as relatively safe investments during the US housing boom .
However , they have fallen in value after higher interest rates led to a drop in the housing market and a surge in mortgage defaults , especially in the sub - prime sector which focused on clients with low incomes or poor credit .
" There will be some very scared people in hedge - fund land today , " said BBC business editor Robert Peston .
" Hedge funds that have borrowed from banks against the security of mortgage - backed debt could be about to see their assets sucked into the banking system and their businesses vanish , " he added .
' Whirlwind blowing '
CCC 's problems came to a head last week when it became apparent that it was not going to be able to service its debts .
Some of the banks that had lent CCC money started liquidating assets , and the Dutch - listed fund 's shares were suspended .
Almost within the blink of an eye , a business that had borrowed $ 21bn from the world 's biggest banks will be gone
Robert Peston BBC business editor
Read Robert Peston 's blog
On Wednesday , CCC said that it had not been able to refinance its business .
It said it had so far defaulted on about $ 16.6 bn ( £ 8.1 bn ) of its debt and the only assets it had left were US government AAA - rated residential mortgage - backed securities .
CCC said it also expected to default on this after the portfolio's value was marked down again on Wednesday .
" Almost within the blink of an eye , a business that had borrowed $ 21bn from the world 's biggest banks to invest in high - quality mortgage - backed securities will be gone , liquidated , kaput , " said BBC business editor Robert Peston .
" Such is the whirlwind blowing through global financial markets . "
CCC 's collapse will lose its clients some $ 600 m .
' Highly illiquid '
The irony of CCC 's problems is that the measures brought in to help ease the global credit crunch , may actually have exacerbated the situation .
Earlier this week , the US Federal Reserve , the Bank of England , the European Central Bank and other central banks said they would pump $ 200 bn into financial markets to stimulate lending .
As part of their plan , they would allow lenders to put up the problematic mortgage - backed securities as collateral for the new central bank - backed loans they were offering .
However , instead of underpinning the mortgage - backed securities market , it seems to have had the opposite effect , giving lenders an opportunity to dump the risky asset .
" The Fed 's new lending emergency lending facility allows the banks to swap mortgage - backed debt for Treasury Bills in a way that Carlyle could not do , " said the BBC 's business editor .
" So it would be rational for the banks to take Carlyle 's assets and exchange them for top- quality , liquid US government bonds , rather than leave loans in place to a business , Carlyle , whose assets remained highly illiquid . "

Gingrich quips Bush should have allowed some ' reminder ' attacks David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday May 29 , 2008
|
Print This Email This During an appearance at a Long Island bookstore last month , former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich was asked by a member of the audience why the United States has not been hit again since 9/11 .
" I honestly do n't know , " Gingrich replied .
" I would have expected another attack .
I was very , very worried ... when we had the sniper attacks , because the sniper attacks were psychologically so frightening .
... I was amazed that the bad guys did n't figure out how to send ten or twelve sniper teams . "
" This is ... one of the great tragedies of the Bush administration , " Gingrich continued .
" The more successful they 've been at intercepting and stopping bad guys , the less proof there is that we 're in danger .
And therefore , the better they 've done at making sure there is n't an attack , the easier it is to say , ' Well , there never was going to be an attack anyway . '
And it 's almost like they should every once in a while have allowed an attack to get through just to remind us . "
Gingrich then recommended splitting the FBI into a domestic crime unit , which would respect civil liberties , and a " small but very aggressive anti-terrorism agency " with " extraordinary ability to eavesdrop . "
" I think that your liberties in a domestic setting are paramount , " Gingrich explained .
" I would rather risk crime than risk losing my civil liberties .
But I would not rather risk a nuclear weapon .
...
I think the greatest danger to our liberty is to actually have the country end up in the kind of attack that would lead us to favor a dictatorship for security . "

Brad Friedman Byon 4/22/2008 , 1:41 pm PT
We were both pleased and mildly surprised to see the invitation arrive from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission ( EAC ) a few weeks back , asking us to come to DC , on their dime , to participate this coming Thursday in a one day " Voting Advocate Roundtable Discussion " on the proposed 2007 federal Voluntary Voting System Guidelines ( VVSG ) .
Our invitation , from EAC Chair Rosemary Rodriguez , is posted at the end of this article .
Even while we 've been nothing short of merciless in our criticism of the EAC , over the years here at The BRAD BLOG , the outreach is both welcome and appreciated , even as we are always very aware of all of the pitfalls associated with participating in such a process .
Yet , with our eyes wide open , we see the opportunity to participate in the process , in hopes --- futile or otherwise --- of attempting to steer it back towards the rails which were jumped at the federal level long ago , as a hopefully positive one .
Call us eternal optimists , but , as long time readers here likely recognize , we have never been one to slap down an olive branch offered , for whatever reason it may have been offered in the first place .
As you might suspect , we have some very strong opinions about the VVSG --- all 598 dizzying , yet wholly inadequate pages of it [ PDF ] --- and the disastrous course it will continue to enable for our election system , if accepted as currently proposed .
For a number of reasons , not the least of which was today 's important primary in PA , we thought it better to be in or near the BRAD BLOG Anchor Desk this week , rather than in the air all day Wednesday , off the grid all day Thursday for the meeting , and back in the air all day Friday ...
So this time around , we 've called on computer security expert --- and transparent election advocate --- Dr. Rebecca Mercuri of Notable Software to represent
The BRAD BLOG in person at Thursday 's EAC roundtable .
If any of you are familiar with Dr. Mercuri ( see her guest blog on our pages last year for just a taste , if you 're not : " The Electric Kool - Aid Voting Test " ) , you know she 's unlikely to disappoint in holding the citizens ' banner high on our behalf .
We 're also preparing no-uncertain - terms written testimony for their record , which we will post here later this week .
Also , among the invitees to this session , were Bev Harris of BlackBoxVoting.org ( who has declined to attend ) and our pal John Gideon of VotersUnite.org who , for similar reasons to ours , is sending software specialist John Washburn to represent VU .
As mentioned , our written testimony will be posted in full here , later this week [ Update : Our full statement to the EAC , now posted here ] , followed perhaps , by details on Thursday 's forum from Dr. Mercuri in the days following .
But for now , the two - page invitation sent to us , as signed by EAC Chair Rosemary Rodriguez , can be downloaded here [ PDF ] and is posted in full below ...

Weird electrons may shrink your laptop
A new type of material with bizarre acting electrons could bring dramatic advances in the world of electronics , predicts an Australian researcher .
Because of the way its electrons spin , the material could be used for applications where information needs to be densely packed , says Associate Professor Xiaolin Wang from the University of Wollongong .
If his work is confirmed , this could mean slimmer laptops and mp3 players .
" Conventional electronics and devices use only the electron 's charge for information processing .
When both spin and charge are used simultaneously , astonishing and unusual physical phenomena occur , " he says .
Wang 's theoretical research is published in the journal Physical Review Letters .
The new material is a " spin gapless semiconductor " , Wang says .
" [ It 's ] completely different to other materials found in nature , which are generally called insulators , semiconductors and metals . "
The key to the difference lies in the properties of the electrons , tiny , negatively charged particles found within the new material , he says .
When an electric current is applied to a normal material like a standard metal or semiconductor , its electrons move in the opposite direction to the electric current .
As they do so , they also spin on their own axis , a bit like when a tennis ball spins as it is hit .
Under normal circumstances , half the electrons in a material spin in one direction and half in the other .
But in the new material , all the electrons are thought to spin in the same direction .
" This is the special feature of this material , " Wang says .
" All the electrons move forward with the spin pointing in the same direction . "
In the tennis analogy , it is as if all the balls have been hit with top - spin .
Based on theoretical calculations ,
Wang has shown that a type of lead - platinum - oxide compound will have these properties .
The researchers have already discovered a special property of this material that relates to the spin of the electrons .
They are working on a paper describing that work .
Crucially ,
Wang has also shown that theoretically it would be a simple matter to manipulate the number of electrons and direction of their spin in this new material .
" We can change the spin direction by changing the external conditions such as temperature or electric current , " he says .
If you 're not from New York , you may think this post does n't apply to you .
But please bear with me .
You 'll see that it applies to us all .
This week , we in New York City saw the death of Mayor Bloomberg 's congestion pricing plan -- which would have reduced gridlock in New York by charging certain drivers to enter the central business district -- thanks to the fact the Speaker Sheldon Silver refused to bring a vote on the proposal to the floor of the New York State Assembly .
You follow me , right ?
It was n't voted down by the entirety of our state level representatives , the politicians representing the totality of the people of New York .
No .
The will of the people was not expressed .
Instead , an insider group of Democratic Assembly members , forming a de facto committee , insisted that Silver put the kabosh on the plan by never allowing a vote .
And why ?
The only possible explanation must be that they were worried that if the will of the people of New York State had been expressed by a vote in the full state assembly , congestion pricing probably would have passed .
After all , the plan had the support of Mayor Bloomberg , the New York City Council , Governor Paterson , State Senate Majority Leader Joe Bruno , State Assembly Minority Leader Jim Tedisco , the 42 Republican members of the State Assembly , a large coalition of environmental and business groups , 67 % of of the voters of New York , and a number , as yet unknown , of Democratic State Assembly members .
Meanwhile , the plan would have brought : $ 354 million in federal funding for improved public transportation as well an annual $ 500 million raised by the plan ; reduced greenhouse gas emissions and more breathable air to a population that suffers record asthma levels and the second worse air quality of any city in the country ; an 11 % reduction in traffic congestion ; 20 - 40 % reduction in time lost in traffic ; and a major dent in the loss of business revenue caused by the loss of this time .
So why would n't Speaker Silver allow the coalition of Democrats and Republicans who may well have formed a majority in the State Assembly to exercise the will of the people of New York State and vote the congestion plan through ?
According to the New York Observer , it is because the Assembly Democrats would have fired him .
So the question becomes , why were so many powerful Democrats in the State Assembly so set against congestion pricing when it had popular support and would have done so much good for the citizens of New York City ?
This is where we turn to how Sheldon Silver 's shenanigans are of so much concern to all of us , not just New Yorkers .
Let me take a step back , now , and look at climate change politics on the Federal level .
Scientists have been warning policy makers about greenhouse gas accumulation for many years .
According to a recent poll , 7 out of ten Americans want the Federal Government to take more action on climate change and half of Americans want much more action .
( And at the local level , Speaker Silver please take note , three in four Americans want their own cities or local governments to do something about climate change . )
So what 's the hold up ?
Campaign contributions , I fear .
The do - something - about - global - warming dollars just are n't pouring in .
On the other hand , big gas and oil contributions are .
According to an MSN Money Central article on campaign finance during the 2006 election cycle , gas and oil made $ 14 million in contributions , not including money given to " independent " 527 groups .
According to the MSN article ( and bearing in mind it was written before the 2006 election ) :
The oil and gas industry also gives heavily to Texas Rep. Joe Barton , chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee ; to Sens. James Talent of Missouri , Conrad Burns of Montana and George Allen of Virginia , all of whom sit on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee ; to Illinois ' Dennis Hastert , speaker of the House , who plays a huge role in deciding what legislation moves to the floor for a vote and what does n't ; and to Pennsylvania 's Rick Santorum , head of the Senate Republican Conference and announced candidate for Republican whip in 2006 if he wins re-election .
My point ?
Money , sadly , may do more of the talking than voting , and not just at the Federal level .
Which brings me back to New York City and congestion pricing .
It turns out that in the aftermath of 9/11 , when New York banned single - occupancy vehicles from crossing into Manhattan through the tunnels during the morning rush hour , New York City 's 2,000 or so parking garages noticed a huge drop off in business .
The fewer people driving into Manhattan , the less money they make .
And since the whole point of congestion pricing is to reduce the number of people driving into Manhattan , you can guess where New York 's parking lot owners stand .
Their solution to the potential dilemma ?
We 're back to the Big Oil scenario .
And you can see for yourself by searching the term " parking " in the campaign contribution database of the New York State Board of Elections .
In 2007 , the same year that Mayor Bloomberg introduced his congestion pricing proposal , Knickerbocker Parking gave $ 20,000 to the Democratic Assembly Campaign Committee and $ 25,000 to the New York State Democratic Committee .
This is to say nothing of the other $ 40,000 or so in contributions to individual candidates by other organizations that come up when you search " parking . "
And it says nothing of the parking - related contributions that this search does n't bring to the fore ( for example , searching for Sheldon Mallah , who is a NYC parking magnate , brings up another $ 10,000 or so ) .
And so we 're back to the question : why did the powerful Democrats in the State Assembly want so badly for congestion pricing to fail that they could n't allow a free vote ?
Did the Democrats destroy congestion pricing for the parking garages ' 40 pieces of silver ?
Or were they representing the wills of their constituents ?
We can't look at Assembly members ' voting records to see , because Sheldon Silver never brought it to a vote .
We 'll never know .
It 's all a secret .
Behind closed doors , those sons of guns killed a piece of inspired vision .
Congestion pricing may have it 's flaws , but it would have made a worthy attempt at addressing a lot of New York City 's problems .
Silver and his crew owed it to us all to let us know where they stood and to be transparent enough to let us know whether their opinions were formed by their voters or they contributors .
The people of the United State , the people of New York City , the people of New York State and the people of the world all want to do what will help preserve planetary habit we depend on for our happiness , health and well - being .
The source of politicians ' campaign contributions must not stand in the way of that .
But corporate interests are perverting our democratic process .
I 'm not an experienced activist and I can't claim I know exactly what to do ( though , I know , for example , that 1Sky could sure use our help ) .
But I do see that the time for those of us who care enough to change our lifestyles to work at changing our politicians -- or at least changing their minds .
The way will become clear .
Individual lifestyle change , using fewer resources is hugely important but we still need more if we want to save the planet .
We need political action , too .
We have to reengage in our democracy so that no politician would dare to do what Sheldon Silver did in New York State or anywhere else again .
So where do we go from here ?

The Nationwide 's own lending has fallen by 40 % in the past year UK house prices have recorded their largest monthly fall since 1991 , says the Nationwide building society .
Prices have fallen by 2.5 % during May , according to its latest monthly survey .
The lender said prices were now 4.4 % lower than a year ago , a drop of £ 8,000 , which has taken the average UK house price down to £ 173,583 .
The Nationwide , the UK 's second - largest lender , said seasonally adjusted price falls were now accelerating and had continued for seven months in a row .
" The pace of house price falls accelerated in May as more weak economic news added to the gathering momentum of negative sentiment about the housing market , " said Fionnuala Earley , the Nationwide 's chief economist .
" At seven months , this is also the longest consecutive period of monthly falls since 1992 , " she added .
Low point
The Nationwide pointed out that its survey chimed closely with much of the other recent evidence about the state of the UK housing market .
A much smaller proportion of borrowers face the full effect of falls in prices than was the case in the 1990s
Fionnuala Earley , Nationwide
House prices : your views Read the experts ' analysis
In March , new mortgage approvals for home buyers were at their lowest since the Bank of England 's records on the topic began back in 1993 .
And recently , estate agents have reported that falling prices have been at their most widespread across the UK since 1978 .
Despite this , Ms Earley argued that the market was not heading for the same sort of crash as that seen in the early 1990s .
" First , fewer homeowners bought at the top of the market in this cycle , " she said .
" This means a much smaller proportion of borrowers face the full effect of falls in prices than was the case in the 1990s .
" Secondly , today 's borrowers have typically put down a larger deposit than their 1980s counterparts , " she added .
Further falls Monthly price movements can be volatile .
But the accelerating pace of the decline in property prices is shown by the fact that in the past three months they were 2.9 % lower than in the previous three months .
At the start of the year that three month - on - three month comparison showed a drop of just 0.9 % .
Ms Earley said that Nationwide was continuing to forecast single - digit house price falls during 2008 .
But if the prices fall in the rest of 2008 as they have done so far this year , then prices will end the year down by 13 % .
Howard Archer , chief UK economist at Global Insight , painted a gloomy picture for some homeowners .
" It now looks more likely than not that house prices will suffer double - digit falls both this year and in 2009 , " he said .
Good news ?
After a boom lasting for more than a decade , house price inflation took a decisive turn downwards last autumn .
The market turned under the impact of two main pressures .
Prices became so high that most first - time buyers were priced out of the market , and the effects of the credit crunch dried up the supply of money for new mortgages .
The recent fall in house prices should be good news for many would - be home owners who have been priced out of the market .
With take - home incomes still rising , despite the economic slowdown , house prices are slowly becoming more affordable .
However , lenders are also demanding much higher deposits than before as they seek to ration their lending .
Despite the efforts of the Bank of England to inject more money into the banking system , banks and building societies are now expecting that fresh mortgage lending will shrink by about 40 % this year .
The many potential buyers still locked out of property ownership are having to rent instead .
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors recently reported that this was continuing to push up the demand for rented properties .

A new Suffolk University survey released today has found that Hillary Clinton has opened up a six point lead on Barack Obama in the state .
Clinton now leads Obama 49 % - 43 % , with 6 % undecided and 2 % refusing to respond .
The strongest evidence yet that Republicans are crossing over to mess with the Democratic primary was revealed when 38 % of those surveyed said that if their candidate does n’t win the Democratic nomination , they plan to vote for John McCain in the fall .
This was a poll of those who were likely to vote in the Democratic primary tomorrow including Democrats , Republicans , and Independents .
Only 44 % of those surveyed in this poll said that if their candidate lost , they vote Democratic .
Besides the 38 % for McCain , 6 % supported Ralph Nader and 11 % were undecided .
Another odd number for a Democratic poll was that 48 % of those surveyed favored making the Bush tax cuts permanent .
A more normal result is that 70 % of those surveyed did not want to raise taxes to pay off the budget deficit .
Voters will hardly ever support a tax increase for anything .

Like in other states , the economy is the number one issue in Indiana ( 54 % ) , followed by the Iraq war ( 21 % ) , and healthcare ( 12 % ) .
When asked who would be the next president , 35 % said Obama , 28 % said Clinton , and 23 % said McCain .
The Indiana primary really is a dead heat , so even if a small number of Republicans , who have no intention of supporting her in the fall , crossover and vote Clinton tomorrow , this will be enough to tilt the state her way .
There are two reasons why Republicans are crossing over and voting for Clinton .
First , they know that their only chance of winning in the fall is if the Democratic Party tears itself apart .
Second , Republicans want to run against Hillary .
It is the easier matchup .
The Republicans are already thinking about November , so I think supporters of both campaigns need to put this endless bickering aside , and move ahead to beating John McCain in the fall .
My guess is that the candidates are probably going to split both states on Tuesday .
Neither one will get a blowout , so the delegates will also be shared , and this thing will continue to drag on for another month .

The women had no doubt .
Educated , young , articulate , they had one aim : to turn their country into a real Islamic state , run according to their interpretation of Islamic law , the shariat .
Only then , they said , would they be protected from the chaos and violence of the modern world .
Only then would there be an end to corruption and misgovernment .
Only then would the country assume its true place as a Muslim nation .
The women were speaking in Rawalpindi , the crowded northern Pakistani city .
All members of an Islamist party , they believed that the current system in Pakistan , where a secular legal system co-exists uncomfortably with a religious one , was doomed to failure .
The coming of shariat was , they told me , inevitable .
They , like the archbishop of Canterbury , were interested in the degree to which the specific practices of a religious community , whether majority or minority , be allowed within the legal system of a nation .
All over the world , the same question is being posed .
In recent years , with the weakening of the nation state and growth in alternative identities , often religious , it has taken on a new urgency , particularly in Western countries with large , newly assertive Muslim minority populations .
The resulting tensions are becoming more and more obvious .
So in France , a country where the only identity officially recognised is that of ' citizen of the republic ' , last week 's row provoked keen interest .
The British system of multiculturalism is seen by many Frenchmen as evidence of an unforgiveable and incomprehensible laxness .
Yet , at the same time that he demands ' immigrants ' adhere to French values , President Nicolas Sarkozy has enraged defenders of his nation 's aggressive secularism by insisting repeatedly that Europe has ' Christian roots ' and that religion , in its broadest sense , is at the root of civilisation .
In Germany and Holland similar debates are taking place as large immigrant communities , particularly those established for several decades , challenge the status quo , asking what their place is in ' Christian ' countries ?
In so doing , they bring to the West an element of a fiery debate that has been longstanding in the Islamic world .
In Pakistan , for example , the argument over whether the state is ' a Muslim state or a state for Muslims ' has never ceased , contributing greatly to its instability .
Elsewhere accommodations have been found , often based on original settlements by colonial powers .
So in India , which does not have a state religion , 140 million Muslims , like other communities , have retained their own civil laws governing marriages , divorces , deaths , births and inheritance .
In overwhelmingly Muslim majority Egypt , religious minorities are governed under separate personal status laws and courts .
The Coptic Christian minority in the country marry under Christian law and foreigners marry under the laws of their countries of origin .
And where Sharia law is applied , it varies too .
In Saudi Arabia , there are frequent executions and amputations , justified by selective reading of the Islamic holy texts .
Elsewhere such punishments are rarely or never applied .
In Saudi Arabia too , women may not drive .
In Bangladesh and Pakistan , they can .
As there is no reference to motor vehicles in the Koran , the decision as to who can or can't drive them has been made by ( male ) Islamic scholars .
States in the Islamic world have made repeated efforts over centuries to co-opt and control the clergy , frequently with disastrous results .
What is clear is that where there is sufficient demand for Islamic law , courts of some kind are likely to be found .
In Afghanistan in the 1990s , in the anarchy of civil war , many initially supported the Taliban simply because they brought a form of order .
In parts of western Pakistan , Islamic judges have long dealt out summary justice according to religious law and tribal customs .
For locals , the choice between slow , corrupt and expensive state legal systems and the religious alternative , rough and ready though it may be , is not hard .
Elsewhere , particularly in Africa , local religious holy men settle disputes .
There are also reports of ' informal ' shariat courts in the UK .
Although their rulings are not recognised by English law , participants often agree to abide by their decisions in the same way that Jewish civil disputes are often settled in their own , officially recognised court , the Beth Din .
This is not surprising .
That some measure of Islamic law is ' unavoidable ' has already been recognised in the UK .
British food regulations allow meat to be slaughtered according to Islamic practices and , as Islam forbids interest on the basis that it is money unjustly earned , the Treasury has approved Sharia - compliant mortgages and investments .
The women in Rawalpindi had no doubt why they wanted more rigorous application of Islamic law .
Though educated , relatively wealthy and from solid family backgrounds , they said they felt disorientated and stressed by the pace and uncertainty of modern life .
' I know that in the law I have answers and that makes me calm , ' one said .
We have talked about the val­ue of med­i­ta­tion before ( see Mind­ful­ness and Med­i­ta­tion in Schools ) , as a form of well - direct­ed men­tal exer­cise than can help train atten­tion and emo­tion­al self - reg­u­la­tion .
Which oth­er stud­ies have shown how it strength­ens spe­cif­ic parts of the brain , main­ly in the frontal lobe .
Dr. Rabin­er shares with us , below , an excel­lent review of a new study that ana­lyzes the ben­e­fits of mind­ful­ness for ado­les­cents and adults with atten­tion deficits .

Does Mind­ful­ness Med­i­ta­tion Help Adults & Teens with ADHD
– By Dr. David Rabin­er
Although med­ica­tion treat­ment is effec­tive for many indi­vid­u­als with ADHD , includ­ing ado­les­cents adults , there remains an under­stand­able need to explore and devel­op inter­ven­tions that can com­ple­ment or even sub­sti­tute for med­ica­tion .
This is true for a vari­ety of rea­sons includ­ing :
1 ) Not all adults with ADHD ben­e­fit from med­ica­tion .
2 ) Among those who ben­e­fit , many have resid­ual dif­fi­cul­ties that need to be addressed via oth­er means .
3 ) Some adults with ADHD expe­ri­ence adverse effects that pre­vent them from remain­ing on med­ica­tion .
Because of the wide­spread inter­est in new ADHD inter­ven­tions — par­tic­u­lar­ly non-phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal approach­es —
I try to cov­er cred­i­ble research in this area when­ev­er I come across it .
I was thus pleased to learn about a very inter­est­ing study of mind­ful­ness med­i­ta­tion as a treat­ment for adults and ado­les­cents with ADHD that was pub­lished in the Jour­nal of Atten­tion Dis­or­ders [ Zylowka , et al. ( 2008 ) .
Mind­ful­ness med­i­ta­tion train­ing in adults and ado­les­cents with ADHD .
Jour­nal of Atten­tion Dis­or­ders , 11 , 737–746 . ]
Accord­ing to the authors , “ … mind­ful­ness med­i­ta­tion involves expe­ri­en­tial learn­ing via silent peri­ods of sit­ting med­i­ta­tion or slow walk­ing and pur­pose­ful atten­tion to dai­ly activ­i­ties .
Relax­ation , although often induced dur­ing the train­ing , is not the sole goal of the activ­i­ty ; rather , the main activ­i­ty is a cog­ni­tive and inten­tion - based process char­ac­ter­ized by self - reg­u­la­tion and atten­tion to the present moment with an open and accept­ing ori­en­ta­tion towards one ’s expe­ri­ences . ”
In recent years , mind­ful­ness med­i­ta­tion has a new approach for stress reduc­tion and has been incor­po­rat­ed into the treat­ment for a vari­ety of psy­chi­atric dis­or­ders , includ­ing depres­sion , anx­i­ety , and sub­stance abuse .
Of spe­cial rel­e­vance to the treat­ment of ADHD are find­ings that med­i­ta­tion has the poten­tial to reg­u­late brain func­tion­ing and atten­tion .
For exam­ple , research has demon­strat­ed that mind­ful­ness med­i­ta­tion can mod­i­fy atten­tion­al net­works , mod­u­late EEG pat­terns , alter dopamine lev­els , and change neur­al activ­i­ty .
As con­cep­tu­al­iza­tions of ADHD now increas­ing­ly rec­og­nize the impor­tance of exec­u­tive func­tion­ing and self - reg­u­la­tion in the dis­or­der , mind­ful­ness med­i­ta­tion — which can be thought of as a type of attention / cognitive exer­cise pro­gram that is focused in improv­ing self - reg­u­la­tion — is a com­ple­men­tary treat­ment that is well worth inves­ti­gat­ing .
How­ev­er , although a few small stud­ies of med­i­ta­tion train­ing in chil­dren with ADHD have yield­ed promis­ing results , no research on the use of mind­ful­ness train­ing in ado­les­cents and adults with ADHD has been pub­lished .
- Par­tic­i­pants —
Par­tic­i­pants were 24 adults and 8 ado­les­cents ( 62 % female ) diag­nosed with ADHD fol­low­ing a com­pre­hen­sive eval­u­a­tion .
Eight par­tic­i­pants fell 1 symp­tom short of meet­ing full diag­nos­tic cri­te­ria and were con­sid­ered to have “ prob­a­ble ADHD . ”
The aver­age age was 48.5 for adults and 15.6 for ado­les­cents .
About two - thirds were being treat­ed with stim­u­lant med­ica­tion and con­tin­ued on med­ica­tion dur­ing the study .
As with many adults and ado­les­cents diag­nosed with ADHD , the major­i­ty had strug­gled with oth­er psy­chi­atric dis­or­ders in their life­time , with mood dis­or­ders being par­tic­u­lar­ly com­mon .
- Mind­ful­ness Train­ing -
Mind­ful­ness med­i­ta­tion is described as involv­ing 3 basic steps : 1 ) bring­ing atten­tion to an “ atten­tion­al anchor ” such as breath­ing ; 2 ) not­ing that dis­trac­tion occurs and let­ting go of the dis­trac­tion ; and , 3 ) refo­cus­ing back to the “ atten­tion­al anchor ” .
This sequence is repeat­ed many times dur­ing the course of each med­i­ta­tive ses­sion .
As the indi­vid­ual becomes bet­ter able to main­tain focus on the atten­tion­al anchor , the notion of “ pay­ing atten­tion to atten­tion ” is intro­duced and indi­vid­u­als are encour­aged to bring their atten­tion to the present moment fre­quent­ly dur­ing the course of the day .
By direct­ing one ’s atten­tion to the process of pay­ing atten­tion , to notic­ing notice when one becomes dis­tract­ed , and to refo­cus­ing atten­tion when dis­trac­tion occurs , mind­ful­ness med­i­ta­tion train­ing can be thought of as an “ atten­tion train­ing ” pro­gram .
As such , exam­in­ing the impact of such train­ing on indi­vid­u­als with ADHD becomes a very inter­est­ing ques­tion to pur­sue .
- Mind­ful­ness Train­ing Pro­gram —
The mind­ful­ness train­ing pro­gram last­ed for 8 weeks ; each week includ­ed one 2.5 hour train­ing ses­sion and dai­ly at - home prac­tice ses­sions .
Week­ly train­ing ses­sions fol­lowed a con­sis­tent for­mat .
The ses­sions began with a short med­i­ta­tion , fol­lowed by a dis­cus­sion of at - home prac­tice , the intro­duc­tion and prac­tic­ing of new exer­cis­es , plan­ning for at - home prac­tice ses­sions for the fol­low­ing week , and a clos­ing sit­ting med­i­ta­tion .
The at - home prac­tice ses­sions con­sist­ed of “ … grad­u­al­ly increas­ing for­mal med­i­ta­tion and var­i­ous mind­ful aware­ness in dai­ly liv­ing exer­cis­es . ”
For the at - home prac­tice ses­sions , par­tic­i­pants received 3 CDs con­tain­ing guid­ed sit­ting med­i­ta­tions that began at 5 min­utes and increased to 15 min­utes .
To adapt tra­di­tion­al mind­ful­ness med­i­ta­tion prac­tice to the unique needs of ado­les­cents and adults with ADHD , sev­er­al mod­i­fi­ca­tions to tra­di­tion­al prac­tice were made .
First , the 8 ‑week pro­gram includ­ed edu­ca­tion­al infor­ma­tion on the symp­toms , eti­ol­o­gy , and biol­o­gy of ADHD .
Sec­ond , sit­ting med­i­ta­tions were short­er than required in sim­i­lar pro­grams ( 45 min­utes of at - home prac­tice is typ­i­cal­ly rec­om­mend­ed ) and walk­ing med­i­ta­tion could be sub­sti­tut­ed for sit­ting med­i­ta­tion .
Third , visu­al aids were incor­po­rat­ed to help explain mind­ful aware­ness con­cepts .
And , fourth , a lov­ing - kind­ness medi­a­tion , i.e. , an exer­cise of wish­ing well to self and oth­ers ) was incor­po­rat­ed at the end of each ses­sion to address the low self - esteem often asso­ci­at­ed with ADHD .
- Mea­sures -
Pre- and posttest assess­ments includ­ed indi­vid­ual self - report scales of ADHD , depres­sion , and anx­i­ety as well as sev­er­al cog­ni­tive tests that were admin­is­tered when par­tic­i­pants were off med­ica­tion .
Atten­tion was assessed using a com­put­er­ized assess­ment called the Atten­tion Net­work Test that mea­sures 3 aspects of atten­tion : alert­ing ( main­tain­ing a vig­i­lant state of pre­pared­ness ) , ori­ent­ing ( select­ing a stim­u­lus among mul­ti­ple inputs ) , and con­flict ( pri­or­i­tiz­ing among com­pet­ing tasks ) .
Neu­ropsy­cho­log­i­cal tests that assessed work­ing mem­o­ry and the abil­i­ty to shift atten­tion sets ( Trails A and B ) were also includ­ed .
At the end of the train­ing , par­tic­i­pants were also asked to rate their over­all sat­is­fac­tion with the train­ing .
- Results -
Sev­en­ty - eight per­cent of par­tic­i­pants ( 25 of 33 ) com­plet­ed the study .
On aver­age , par­tic­i­pants attend­ed 7 of the 8 week­ly train­ing ses­sions .
Adults report­ed an aver­age of 90 min­utes and 4.6 ses­sions per week of at - home med­i­ta­tion prac­tice ; ado­les­cents aver­aged 43 min­utes and 4 ses­sions of week­ly at - home prac­tice .
Both ado­les­cents and adults who com­plet­ed the pro­gram report­ed high lev­els of sat­is­fac­tion with it — aver­age scores above 9 on a 1 to 10 sat­is­fac­tion scale .
Sev­en­ty - eight per­cent of par­tic­i­pants report­ed a reduc­tion in total ADHD symp­toms , with 30 % report­ing at least a 30 % symp­tom reduc­tion ( a 30 % reduc­tion in symp­toms is often used to iden­ti­fy clin­i­cal­ly sig­nif­i­cant improve­ment in ADHD med­ica­tion tri­als ) .
Because the major­i­ty of par­tic­i­pants were receiv­ing med­ica­tion treat­ment , for many these declines rep­re­sent improve­ment above and beyond what ben­e­fits were already being pro­vid­ed by med­ica­tion .
On neu­rocog­ni­tive test per­for­mance , sig­nif­i­cant improve­ments were found on the mea­sure of atten­tion­al con­flict and on sev­er­al oth­er neu­ropsy­cho­log­i­cal tests ( i.e. , Stroop col­or - word test and Trails A and B ) but not for mea­sures of work­ing mem­o­ry .
For adults , sig­nif­i­cant reduc­tions in depres­sive and anx­i­ety symp­toms were report­ed .
Com­pa­ra­ble reduc­tions in these symp­toms were not evi­dent in ado­les­cents .
- Sum­ma­ry and Impli­ca­tions -
Results from this study indi­cate that mind­ful­ness med­i­ta­tion train­ing may be a ben­e­fi­cial com­ple­men­tary treat­ment approach for ado­les­cents and adults with ADHD .
Pos­i­tive find­ings include : 1 ) the absence of any report­ed adverse events ; 2 ) high­ly favor­able rat­ings of the treat­ment by par­tic­i­pants ; 3 ) reduc­tions in self - report­ed ADHD symp­toms report­ed by over three quar­ters of par­tic­i­pants , even though the major­i­ty were already being treat­ed with med­ica­tion ; 4 ) sig­nif­i­cant improve­ment on sev­er­al of the neu­ropsy­cho­log­i­cal mea­sures ; and , 5 ) reduc­tions in depres­sive and anx­i­ety symp­toms for the adults .
The authors are appro­pri­ate­ly cau­tious in dis­cussing their find­ings and sug­gest that the study sup­ports the “ … fea­si­bil­i­ty and poten­tial util­i­ty of mind­ful­ness med­i­ta­tion in at least a sub­set of adults and ado­les­cents with ADHD . ”
They are care­ful to note , how­ev­er , that this was a pilot study with a small sam­ple , and that the report­ed pre-post changes in behav­ioral and neu­rocog­ni­tive mea­sures should be “ … con­sid­ered explorato­ry giv­en the absence of a con­trol group and reliance on self - report mea­sures of psy­chi­atric symp­toms . ”
Giv­en the promis­ing results obtained in this pilot study , there is a clear need for a more exten­sive research on mind­ful­ness med­i­ta­tion train­ing as an inter­ven­tion for ADHD .
In the mean­time , although mind­ful­ness med­i­ta­tion could not be con­sid­ered a sci­en­tif­i­cal­ly sup­port­ed treat­ment for ADHD , it may have ben­e­fits as a com­ple­men­tary treat­ment and is high­ly unlike­ly to have any adverse effects .
I find it both encour­ag­ing and excit­ing that there seems to be grow­ing inter­est among ADHD researchers to explore the sci­en­tif­ic sup­port for com­ple­men­tary approach­es such as mind­ful­ness med­i­ta­tion train­ing and to sub­ject a wider range of treat­ments sub­ject­ed to rig­or­ous sci­en­tif­ic research .
This has not always been the case and it would be won­der­ful if this trend were to con­tin­ue .
I hope that the authors of this study are already in the midst of the con­trolled tri­al that they call for and will cer­tain­ly con­tin­ue to cov­er these kinds of inter­est­ing inves­ti­ga­tions in Atten­tion Research Update as they appear in the lit­er­a­ture .

For relat­ed and mind­ful read­ing , you will enjoy :
If an Iranian woke up in America and glimpsed the front page of a newspaper , he’d be reminded of home : a teetering economy , a rest - less populace , a tough - talking leader .
This nation is fascinated by what it calls the Great Satan , and it is watching the U.S. primaries for signs of how it might benefit from crises similar to its own facing the new American president .
Since the Islamic Revolution in 1979 , this theocracy has clashed with Democratic and Republican administrations alike ; it has endured international sanctions while practicing shadow diplomacy and brinkmanship .
Iranians know the new U.S. leader will inherit an overextended military in Iraq , a declining dollar , high oil prices and a sub - prime mortgage crisis that are straining the American economy .
This scenario , analysts here suggest , may lead to a softer U.S. foreign policy , especially in the Middle East , where Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has become widely admired for his harsh line against the Bush administration .
Iran would be seeking signs of detente from the new American leader , including the lifting of sanctions , the unfreezing of about $ 20 billion in Iranian assets and Tehran ’s membership in the World Trade Organization .
Iran is skilled at playing the outcast , but it craves international political legitimacy at a time its gas and oil reserves are being sought by China and India , whose energy demands are escalating .

Tehran could reciprocate U.S. overtures by pressuring fellow Shiite Muslims in Iraq to rein in insurgents and militias , and by stemming violence in Afghanistan .
At recent Friday prayers , former President Hashemi Rafsanjani hinted that Iran could work with the U.S. in calming regional tensions .
His statement was vague but suggested a degree of diplomacy absent from Ahmadinejad ’s anti-Western rhetoric .
It is unclear how Iran ’s ruling clerics and the next American administration would resolve Tehran ’s support of Hamas in the Gaza Strip and Hezbollah in Lebanon , two militant Islamic groups that have long been U.S. adversaries .
There is also little indication that Iran would halt its nuclear enrichment program , which the Bush administration says is designed to build a nuclear bomb .
Tehran says its nuclear ambitions are only for civilian energy projects .
Some analysts wonder whether the Islamic Republic , led by supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , wants a significant improvement in relations with the U.S. Since the Islamic Revolution in 1979 , when militants in Tehran seized 52 American hostages and held them for 444 days , the weekly chants of “ Death to America ” have become a defining mantra , much in the same way Bush ’s “ axis of evil ” resonates with American conservatives .

“ For an ideological regime like Iran ’s you need an enemy , and the U.S. is a good enemy because of all the notorious things it ’s done in the region , ” said cleric Mohammad Ali Abtahi , head of the Institute for Interreligious Dialogue in Tehran .
“ If you have a big enemy , it makes you big too . ”
But , like the U.S. , Iran is feeling the squeeze of an economy in turmoil and an uneasy population .
Unemployment and inflation are high , even as Iran is benefiting from soaring oil prices .
Recent parliamentary elections highlighted the split among conservatives between those who support the populist Ahmadinejad and detractors who blame him for mismanaging the economy .
These concerns and the weight of economic sanctions could lead to a less aggressive foreign policy .
Iranian analysts watching the U.S. presidential contest believe Democratic Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton or Barack Obama , although both viewed as sympathetic to Israel , would be better for U.S. - Iran relations than Republican Sen .
John McCain , who is regarded as pragmatic but ideologically closer to President Bush on matters such as Iraq and the use of military force .
Iranians have been startled by some of McCain ’s comments .
In March , the senator accused Iran of sheltering and training Al Qaeda militants ; he quickly retracted the statement .
When campaigning in South Carolina in 2007 , McCain joked about bombing Iran to the tune of a Beach Boys song .
Advertisement
“ If Mr. Obama won the election , it would be good , ” said Hooshang Tale , a former member of parliament .
“ He ’s a newcomer without the old ties , and we can hope that American policy would undergo a deep change .
I think Mrs. Clinton still represents old Washington , the past regimes .
The U.S. must take the first step .
If a small country like Iran takes the first step it can lose face , but the big power does n’t lose his face . ”
A geophysics student at Tehran University , who gave his name only as Behrang for fear of retribution , said : “ I ’m a fan of Hillary Clinton .
If she is elected it will help , but , really , it ’s a question of whether Iran will change , not so much who changes in the White House . ”
No matter who wins the White House in November , it is unlikely there will be quick steps toward improving relations with Iran .
Democrats and Republicans blame Tehran for supporting terrorism and supplying weapons that are killing U.S. troops in Iraq .
A recent survey by World Public Opinion found that Iranians are softening their attitudes toward America : 57 % of Iranians supported open - ended talks with Washington , and 64 % favored greater trade with the U.S .
Advertisement
“ All senior officials support rapprochement if there ’s a significant shift in American attitudes toward Iran , ” said Mohammed Marandi , director of the North American Studies Department at Tehran University .
“ If the Iranians feel less threatened by America , they ’ll be more open .
When you have 160,000 U.S. troops in Iraq , three American aircraft carriers in the Persian Gulf , and a president and vice president who keep talking about military options , it ’s hard to think about Iranians being open . ”
He added : “ Obama or Clinton would be preferred over McCain , but anybody besides Bush would be an improvement . ”

Russians to operate computers by power of thought

Russians to operate computers by power of thought
The scientists of Southern Federal University won 750,000 dollars award for the development of the systems of the mental computer control .
For the next 18 months Rostov scientists together with their Taganrog and Saint Petersburg colleagues are going to develop programs and make a research that will help them to create such a system .
The system is to work in this way : special equipment will catch brain signals that go through the metal helmet with electrodes .
Then with the help of the signal enhancer the signal will go to the computer .
This will make the life of disabled people much easier .
Those who ca n’t move will be able to write email letters and even IM people around the world .

A person , who ca n’t speak , will be able to point to the picture ‘ Drinks ’ or ‘ Food ’ .
‘ Those , who ca n’t move , will get a chance to write emails and even drive wheelchair by the mind power ’ , - says a head of the Research Institute of Neurocybernetics Boris Vladimirskiy .
He adds that to rule the computer a person needs to state clearly the thought command , for example , by imagining how he is moving the cursor of the mouse on the computer screen .
Many Americans who have adjustable rate mortgages ( ARMs ) are facing the harsh reality that when their mortgage rate resets , they will have a higher monthly payment on a property that will likely be valued less than what it is today .
Unfortunately , some of these home owners with ARMs are too far upside down in the loan ( meaning the value of the mortgage debt is greater than the value of the mortgaged property ) to even begin the process of trying to refinance into a fixed rate mortgage .
I know many people in this situation , and it ’s really tough to come up with the best solution for this .
I fear that the home loans in this situation will ultimately be a much larger drag on the real estate market than the current subprime fiasco .
However , I ’ll save that for another article .
For those of you who are currently in an adjustable rate mortgage and are fortunate enough to still have some equity in your property , I have this to say : IF YOU THINK THERE’S A CHANCE YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD THE PAYMENT WHEN THE RATE RESETS , YOU NEED TO EXPLORE YOUR REFINANCING OPPORTUNITIES RIGHT NOW .
There are several reasons behind why I feel so strongly about this .
Here they are in no particular order ;
1 ) The housing market is likely to continue its slide through 2008 and probably well into 2009 .
That means the equity you have in your house is only going to last so long before you ’re in the same boat as many “ upside down ” borrowers .
Once the loan to value ratio gets too high ( meaning you have less equity in your property ) you may not be able to refinance your property .
2 ) There ’s no point in trying to hold out for lower interest rates .
This morning , the average rate on a 30 year fixed mortgage was roughly 5.5 % .
Historically , that is an absolutely incredible rate .
Besides , what would holding out for 5.25 % really save you ?
In the end , probably not a whole lot .
Currently , I think there ’s much more risk in waiting for rates to fall than there is in locking in now and being done with it .
3 ) If banks have to continue to have massive debt related write offs , the lending standards are going to become more and more strict .
What you might be able to qualify for now ( i.e. 95 % financing ) might be completely dried up in the coming months .
That means you ’re either going to have to pay a much higher interest rate , have a ton of equity , or put down loads of cash in order to secure financing .
None of those three scenarios seem very appealing and / or likely .
Truth be told , I am in a very Chicken Little state of mind when it comes to real estate .
I fully believe the sky is falling and it is going to take a very long time for this real estate depression ( it ’s well past a correction at this point ) to work itself out .
If you look at the many historical ratios regarding rent vs. mortgage payments and general affordability , we probably have another 15 % or more until we hit a reasonable bottom in prices .
So , if you need to look into refinancing your existing mortgage into something fixed , there really is no time like the present .
Even if you ’re not sure , at the very least , explore your options and see what is currently available to you .
Having an arbitrary rule justifying the consumption of food dropped on the floor within a certain time frame is convenient , especially when said food is a brownie .
Unfortunately , tests ( and logic ) confirm that germs will stick to most foods right on contact .
While a global food crisis sharpens , a new report says a " staggering " amount of food is tossed out as garbage .
More than enough food is produced to feed the world , the report contends .
It just does n't all get where it 's needed .
In the United States , as much as 30 percent of food , worth about $ 48.3 billion , is tossed out each year , according to the report by the Stockholm International Water Institute ( SIWI ) , the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) and the International Water Management Institute ( IWMI ) .
If a significant amount of that food can be saved , then international trade should allow some of it to get in the hands of the hungry , the researchers said today .
Wasted food means wasted water , too .
" As much as half of the water used to grow food globally may be lost or wasted , " said David Molden , director of research at IWMI .
" Curbing these losses and improving water productivity provides win-win opportunities for farmers , business , ecosystems and the global hungry .
An effective water - saving strategy will first require that minimizing food wastage is placed firmly on the political agenda . "
An estimated 1.2 billion people already live in areas where there is not enough water to meet demand , the report states .
And rising demand means the problem is getting worse .
" Unless we change our practices , water will be a key constraint to food production in the future , " said Pasquale Steduto of the FAO .
In poorer countries , a majority of uneaten food is lost before it has a chance to be consumed .
Depending on the crop , an estimated 15 - 35 percent of food may be lost in the field .
Another 10 - 15 percent is discarded during processing , transport and storage .
In richer countries , production is more efficient but waste is greater : People toss the food they buy and all the resources used to grow , ship and produce the food along with it .
And many people overeat , the report notes .
In a recent article by LiveScience , researchers said new technologies can improve food production in the long - term , but the United Nations has made it clear that short - term solutions are needed to prevent unrest and starvation in many parts of the world .
The new report finds opportunities amid the current challenges .
" Improving water productivity and reducing the quantity of food that is wasted can enable us to provide a better diet for the poor and enough food for growing populations , " said Jan Lundqvist of SIWI .
" Reaching the target we propose , a 50 percent reduction of losses and wastage in the production and consumption chain , is a necessary and achievable goal . "
The report is being presented today at a meeting of the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development .
Improving the number of people worldwide who have access to the Internet has been a stated goal of nations , international bodies , and NGOs for years , but practical attempts to do so have often faced daunting challenges .
Hostile terrain , periodic extremes of temperature and weather , limited / intermittent electrical power , and the ever - present danger of being eaten by lions , bears , or giant fire - breathing iguanas are all issues that must be solved , and that 's before the human factors are dealt with .
It does no good , after all , to run a copper cable into a town to provide Internet access , only to have someone dig it up next week and sell it for scrap .
Intel 's Rural Connectivity Platform ( RCP ) is designed to push traditional 802.11 wireless connections out to much greater distances than would normally be possible , thereby reducing the amount of cable that must be laid between any two points .
Using the 802.11 standard means that spectrum availability is not usually an issue , and Intel 's RCP supports frequencies of 900MHz , 2.4GHz , and the 5.2-5.8GHz spectrum .
The idea of focusing and transmitting a wireless signal in order to boost its range is nothing new , but Intel 's RCP uses a modified TDMA ( time division multiple access ) system .
A standard wireless system broadcasts a message and waits for a reply .
If the reply is not acknowledged within a certain period of time , the station broadcasts again .
Intel 's RCP TDMA system does away with the acknowledgment phase , and gives each radio a set block of time to send data and a set block of time to receive it .
According to Jeff Galinovsky , a senior platform manager at Intel , removing the acknowledgment phase substantially increases the amount of bandwidth that 's available at any given point , thus increasing the wireless system 's range .
Intel 's specifications for RCP deployment state that towers may be up to 60 miles ( 100 km ) apart .
Towers can be deployed in several different configurations , as shown below :
Intel is n't ready for full commercial deployment at present — sales should begin in India later this year — but the company 's RCP has a
number of potential advantages .
At less than $ 500 per unit and an estimated $ 1,000 for two nodes and the associated backend
infrastructure , the RCP should deliver Internet access at a much lower cost - per - user then more traditional access methods can
manage .
Battery replacement or adequate power delivery is also a non-issue — Intel 's RCP only draws 5 - 6 W at most , which means the
unit 's needs can be met by solar power .

Address by José Ramón Machado Ventura , First Vice - President of Cuba ’s Council of State , at a session on ``Sustainable Development : the Environment , Climate Change and Energy '' , during the 5th EU / LAC ( European Union / Latin America and Caribbean ) summit meeting in Lima , Peru , May 16 - 17 .
Your Excellency :
At the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro 16 years ago , Fidel Castro issued a prophetic warning , stating that ``an important biological species is at risk of disappearing as a result of the rapid and progressive destruction of its natural living conditions : humanity ' ' .
Time has proven him right .
Let us not mince our words : we wo n’t attain sustainable development , the negative impacts of climate change will not be halted or reversed , and the environment will not be preserved for future generations , if the irrational patterns of production , distribution and consumption imposed upon us by capitalism prevail .
The globalisation of neoliberal policies has drastically exacerbated the crisis .
Facing the crisis that threatens humanity today cannot mean preventing the development of those who need development the most .
We have common but different responsibilities .
Those who have unjustly and selfishly hoarded riches and technologies , who are responsible for 76 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions since 1850 , must bear most of the burden of this effort .
Developed countries must honour the commitments they assumed at Kyoto to mitigate of this phenomenon and , in addition , must mobilise additional resources to aid adaptation efforts in South countries .
For instance , if the United States were to reallocate , as official aid for sustainable development , a small portion of its military budget for the 2008 fiscal year , a budget which reaches the astronomical figure of 696 billion dollars , it would make a vital contribution to this effort .
European Union countries , several of which have the highest military budgets on the planet , could be the first to take steps in this direction , and urge their main ally to follow in their footsteps .
A growing number of countries can no longer afford to pay for food .
Hunger continues to claim lives and the situation is getting worse .
The sinister plan to convert food into fuel , advanced by the president of the United States , must be fought with strong scientific arguments and with the unquestionable evidence and eloquent facts provided by daily life .
Sustainable development requires a revolution in our values and in the way we confront the inequalities of today and the challenges of tomorrow .
We must launch a global energy revolution , sustained by savings , rationality and efficiency .
Cuba hopes that the members of the European Union will assume their duties .
Responsible conduct by its members would help to ensure that all developed countries meet their commitment to reduce their greenhouse emissions by no less than 40 percent from 1990 levels , by 2020 .
The European Union , as a world leader in the production of clean technologies and the export of renewable energy sources , is in a position to create a mechanism for the transfer of these technologies , on preferential terms , to the countries of Latin America , the Caribbean and the rest of the Third World .
I will mention but one example .
The generosity of the people and government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and initiatives such as PETROCARIBE and ALBA are an example that ought to be followed by the European Union .
The time is ripe for action in the spirit of solidarity , and without demagogy .
Thank you very much .

There is a lot of buzz lately about a hydrogen economy .
I have always been a bit of a skeptic about this hydrogen economy , because although hydrogen is a clean burning energy carrier , it is currently produced in a pretty dirty way .
Over 85 % of the world ’s hydrogen is produced by using natural gas in a process called steam reformation .
Unfortunately this process is not very green , in fact , for each pound of hydrogen this process makes , it produces 4 pounds of greenhouse gases in the form of carbon monoxide ( CO ) and carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) .
So , the idea of switching an entire economy from one dirty energy carrier ( oil ) to a little less dirty energy carrier ( hydrogen ) does not make too much sense to me .
Now the idea of the hydrogen economy is to produce all hydrogen using renewable energy sources , which in theory sounds great .
However , typical electrolysis is an expensive , slow , and somewhat inefficient process and this is precisely why steam reformation is the process of choice for producing hydrogen .
Simply put , it is cheaper and faster than electrolysis , but in no way is it greener or cleaner .
Until now the electrodes used in the electrolysis process were made of precious metal catalyst materials making them too expensive to compete with steam reformation .
A company called Quantum Sphere , Inc. has found a way around this little problem by using an alkaline electrolysis process , which eliminates the need for precious metal catalysts .
In alkaline electrolysis , nickel is the ideal catalyst because it can easily be produced at the nano scale and it is far less costly than platinum .
The company has also invented a technique , using nano technology , to increase the catalytic surface area of each electrode , giving them 2,000 times more surface area than its predecessors .
QSI has demonstrated that by using a blend of their nickel and iron catalyst materials , they can achieved electrolysis efficiencies exceeding 85 % , while achieving production increases of ten - fold over all other previously published data .
Keep in mind that electrolysis is a pollution free , non CO2 emitting process .
At $ 1.14 to $ 4.09 per pound of hydrogen , this drastic improvement in electrolysis efficiency now makes hydrogen an economically and commercially viable replacement for our current fossil fuel economy .
With efficiencies like these , we may just see compact electrolysis units inside future automobiles , producing on - demand hydrogen to power on board fuel cells .
BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) --
Mothers cradle children in their arms .
Fathers smile softly at the helpless bodies they hold .
Other parents are bent over from the weight of their teenage kids whose legs fall limp , almost touching the ground .
In the absence of basic medical equipment , these parents do this every day .
An Iraqi boy gives a thumbs up after receiving his wheelchair .
Brad Blauser , center , created the program .
Khaled is a father of three .
On this day , his young daughter , Mariam , is getting fitted for her new wheelchair .
Her arms and legs are painfully thin , little more than skin and bone .
She 's 7 years old , but looks barely half that .
She and both her siblings , a sister and brother , suffer from varying degrees of polio .
None of them can walk .
Asked how he and his family cope , Khaled chokes up , fighting back tears .
" I am sick of life -- what can I say to you ? " he says after a long pause .
One man , Brad Blauser , has vowed to try to make life a little easier for these families by organizing the distribution of wheelchairs , donated and paid for by his charity , Wheelchairs for Iraqi Kids .
He first came to Iraq in 2004 as a civilian contractor .
Struck by the abject chaos surrounding him and seeing helpless children scooting along the ground , he pledged to find a way to help .
Watch dads , moms carry kids ; tears flow when wheelchairs arrive »
His first step was to consult an Army medic to find out what hospitals really needed .
" He surprised me with his answer about pediatric wheelchairs .
We 've got so many children out in the city that the ones who can get around are following their friends by dragging themselves around on the ground , which is heartbreaking to see , " he says .
" I was surprised .
It took me aback . "
Enlisting the help of generous supporters and an Iraqi humanitarian group Wheelchairs for Iraqi Kids was born in August of 2005 .
Thirty days later its first 31 chairs were delivered .
To date more than 250 Iraqi families have received the wheelchairs .
Blauser has partnered with a nonprofit group called Reach Out and Care Wheels , which sells him the chairs at a manufacturing price of about $ 300 .
The chairs are made by prisoners at the South Dakota State Penitentiary and ultimately delivered in Iraq by the U.S. military .
" Getting these prisoners involved , it just means the world to them , " said Andrew Babcock , the executive director of Reach Out and Care Wheels .
" Even the prisoners , I 've been there and visited , and they 're so excited .
They come up with different design ideas and ways to make things better for the kids .
They want to know where the chairs are going and what kids we 're helping . "
Impact Your World See how you can make a difference
Blauser said it 's unbelievable to be there when the chairs are delivered .
" The most affecting thing about this whole wheelchairs for children is when the parents realize the gift that is being given to their children and they reach out to hug you . " he said .
" The tears are running from their eyes and they say , ' We never thought that you could do this . ' "
Blauser is helped on the Iraqi missions by the civil affairs division of the U.S. military , which helps organize the safe transport of the families to the distribution point and adjustment of the wheelchairs to fit each child .
He said it gives " the troops something when they go home , something good to remember where they know they have contributed , they know they have done a good thing . "
Army Sgt. 1st Class Jason Jurack agrees .
" It brings a smile to your face .
It really gives a different image to the Army as a whole -- helping people out , putting a smile on local nationals ' faces , little kids that need our help . "
It 's a sentiment that is echoed by Samira Al - Ali , the head of the Iraqi group that finds the children in need .
On this day , she tells the soldiers she hopes that this humanitarian act will give them a different image of Iraq , not one of a gun and war , she says .
Her words are simple but effective .
" I wish the world would see with their own eyes the children of Iraq and help the children of Iraq , because the children of Iraq have been deprived of everything , " she said .
" Even a normal child has been deprived of their childhood ; a disabled child and their family is dealing with so much more . "
The children also show gratitude , even those who can scarcely move .
Blauser remembers one boy 's father who dressed him in a three - piece suit , with the trousers hanging off his motionless legs .
" He could n't move his legs or his arms .
But when we sat him in his chair , he gave us the thumbs up . "
Iraqi parents will go to any lengths to improve the quality of their children 's lives .
Blauser points to one of his favorite photographs , of a father carrying his son in his arms , an endless desert road behind him .
He had carried his son more than 6 miles to get a wheelchair .
" In August 2006 we had a distribution in northern Iraq , " Blauser remembered .
" We watched him [ the father ] come forward , and people rushed to take the boy from his arms .
And he said , ' No , I 've been carrying this child all my life .
I can carry him the last 100 yards to receive his wheelchair . ' " E- mail to a friend

Humane Society releases new video of mistreated livestock Associated Press
Published : Wednesday May 7 , 2008

Print This Email This By NATASHA T. METZLER WASHINGTON 
The Humane Society of the United States released video footage Wednesday of sick and injured livestock the group says were mistreated at auction sites and stockyards where cattle are sold for slaughter .
The group released videos shot during April and May showing downed cows abandoned for hours at facilities in Maryland , New Mexico , Pennsylvania and Texas .
A video was posted on the group 's Web site .
" We found downed cows in a state of ill health , with no relief provided to the animals , " said Wayne Pacelle , the organization 's president and chief executive .
Downed cattle may pose a higher risk of contamination from E. coli , salmonella or mad cow disease because they typically wallow in feces and their immune systems are often weak .
Pacelle said there is no indication the downed cows his group filmed entered the food supply .
But he added that the videos point out that auction sites fall between regulatory cracks , raising concern that a downed cow could potentially leave a facility and enter the food supply .
" Every place that we looked , we found downed animals , " he said .
" No one is watching .
No one is taking responsibility for these animals . "
The footage shows two downed cows at a site in Hereford , Texas ; a downed cow left overnight outside an auction facility 's barn in Westminster , Md. ; two downed cows in at a site Clovis , N.M. ; and a downed calf in Greencastle , Pa .
In the Maryland case , investigators called the local Humane Society the next morning to euthanize the cow that spent the night behind the barn .
" I want to stress our procedure on downer cows such as this is to euthanize them in a timely manner , " said Randy Bouldin , owner of the Livestock Exchange in Hereford .
" Because of this we 're going to reiterate to our employees the proper procedure . "
But he criticized the Humane Society investigators for allowing the cows to lie there without providing assistance , saying they were " more interested in a story than the humane handling of those two cows . "
Bouldin added that the video footage was not time stamped to prove that the cows were actually there for the four hours the society claimed .
Pacelle said his organization had received a complaint about the Texas facility and had long - standing concerns about the Pennsylvania site .
He said the New Mexico facility was chosen because it was close to Hereford and the Maryland auction because it was close to Washington .
" We intend to work immediately with the businesses where the improper handling reportedly occurred , " Jim Santomaso , president of industry trade group the Livestock Marketing Association , said in a statement .
" LMA shares everyone 's interest in promoting the proper care and handling of all livestock , at all stages of their life . "
Agriculture Secretary Ed Schafer said that ensuring proper treatment of animals outside of slaughterhouses and other federally inspected facilities would require cooperation between federal and state officials , as well as industry groups .
" Even though this is not a food safety issue , these actions of animal cruelty are not acceptable , " Schafer said in a statement .
Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D - Calif. , urged the Agriculture Department on Wednesday to conduct an industrywide investigation to assess the degree of animal cruelty in the industry .
" This is further evidence that oversight to ensure the humane treatment of animals destined for our food supply is inadequate .
Food animals should never be subject to the kind of horrible acts as witnessed in these videos and reported by concerned citizens , " Feinstein wrote in a letter to Schafer .
A graphic videotape made inside a California slaughterhouse released by the same group in January led to the nation 's largest beef recall .
Across the country in 2006 , 1,200 livestock marketing businesses handled 35.6 million head of cattle and calves , according to government figures cited in a release from the Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association .
In Texas , the nation 's leading cattle producing state , market inspectors from the association inspect animals each week at auctions .
They check brands and ownership of millions of cattle each year , the release states .
" It is regrettable that four isolated incidents have been highlighted by HSUS , but our experience tells us that with upwards of 4 million head marketed each year in Texas , mishandling of cattle at auction markets is not a widespread problem , " said Dave Scott , the association 's first vice president .

Google I/O Google 's famously stark home page was a happy accident .
It was designed by company co-founder Sergey Brin , and as legend has it , stark was his only option .
" We did n't have a web master , " Brin says .
" And I do n't do html . "
But nearly ten years on , the world 's largest search engine still believes in that no-frills landing page , and on Thursday morning , at the Google I/O developer conference in San Francisco , Google vice president / poster child Marissa Mayer used it as teaching tool for several hundred web - happy coders .
" You 're all familiar with Occam 's Razor - that the simplest answer is probably right , " Mayer said during her morning keynote .
" The same thing is true in [ web ] design .
The simplest design is probably right . "
After lauding the effectiveness of the home page she 's overseen for the past 8 years - and flashing a photo of Brin in his bathing suit - Mayer gave two other Googlicious examples of web simplicity trumping the urge for more content .
Sergey Brin and Marissa Mayer
As you all know , an ordinary Google search gives you just ten results .
You can't get more without loading another page .
Google has tried packing more results into that first page , but according to Mayer , this typically results in less traffic .
After increasing the number of first page results to 30 for a group of guinea pigs , Google watched as the number of searches dropped by 20 per cent .
" It turns out that it takes us longer to produce 30 results per page , " Mayer explained .
" And that latency drove the decline . "
Then she turned to Google Maps .
When this AJAX - ified service originally launched , the maps were significantly larger .
But Mayer and company soon realized that users were more likely to load smaller images .
" When we reduced the size of the page by 30 per cent , the number of map requests increased by 30 per cent . "
Of course , simplicity is n't the only mantra at Google .
Mayer also told her audience of rapt developers they should never shy from the most daunting of tasks , pointing out that Brin- buddy Larry Page has " a healthy disrespect for the impossible . "
And she could n't help but trot out that other self - satisfied Googlism : " 20 Per Cent Time . "
You know , Googlers are encouraged to spend one day a week working on whatever they feel like working on .
Mayer bragged that 20 Per Cent Time led to such well - known services as Google News , Google Scholar , and Google Alerts .
She did not list the 20 Per Cent Time projects that resulted in absolutely nothing .
Neither did she acknowledge that this sort of thing works best if you have one of the world 's greatest money - making machines .
Mayer 's audience did n't really perk up until she told them they could use Google in Muppet mode .
As you may know , if you visit the Google preferences page , you can change the default language to " Bork , bork , bork ! " - in which case the world 's largest search engine proceeds to channel the Swedish Chef .
According to Mayer , Google translates more than a million pages a day into " Bork , bork , bork ! " ®
Cloned Stem Cells Treat Parkinsons Disease In Mice
Cloning for brain repair in mice .
NEW YORK , March 23 , 2008 Research led by investigators at Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center ( MSKCC ) has shown that therapeutic cloning , also known as somatic - cell nuclear transfer ( SCNT ) , can be used to treat Parkinson s disease in mice .
The studys results are published in the March 23 online edition of the journal Nature Medicine .
For the first time , researchers showed that therapeutic cloning or SCNT has been successfully used to treat disease in the same subjects from whom the initial cells were derived .
While this current work is in animals , it could have future implications as this method may be an effective way to reduce transplant rejection and enhance recovery in other diseases and in other organ systems .
In therapeutic cloning or SCNT , the nucleus of a somatic cell from a donor subject is inserted into an egg from which the nucleus has been removed .
This cell then develops into a blastocyst from which embryonic stem cells can be harvested and differentiated for therapeutic purposes .
As the genetic information in the resulting stem cells comes from the donor subject , therapeutic cloning or SCNT would yield subject - specific cells that are spared by the immune system after transplantation .
The new study shows that therapeutic cloning can treat Parkinsons disease in a mouse model .
The scientists used skin cells from the tail of the animal to generate customized or autologous dopamine neurons the missing neurons in Parkinsons disease .
The mice that received neurons derived from individually matched stem cell lines exhibited neurological improvement .
But when these neurons were grafted into mice that did not genetically match the transplanted cells , the cells did not survive well and the mice did not recover .
If harvesting cells from your placenta makes you queasy , and it's too late to access some umbilical cord blood , there 's yet another medical waste product that may provide a new , uncontroversial source of stem cells : menstrual blood .
Dr. Amit Patel from the University of Pittsburgh found that the uterine lining , which is shed during menstruation , contains millions of stem cells .
These cells are multipotent ( can give rise to several different cell types ) and have the capacity for self - renewal — two essential properties of stem cells .
The study showed that menstrual stem cells ( MenSCs ) could differentiate into cells that give rise to fat , cartilage , bone , skin , muscle , heart , and brain cells ( though it 's important to note that the MenSC 's did not actually differentiate into these cells — only into their predecessors ) .
The cells actually showed greater potential capacity than bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells , as they had some of the same properties as human embryonic stem cells .
So , how to save your valuable period blood ?
Dr. Patel partnered up with Cryo - Cell International , the company that brought you cord blood storage for your infant , has now launched the first - ever proprietary menstrual stem cell service .
C'elle ( " See - El " ) , as the service is called , costs $ 500 and allows you to collect and FedEx your menstrual stem cells for preservation .
According to the Web site , " you ’ll receive an attractive , discreet C’elle collection kit by FedEx delivery .
Inside , you ’ll find everything needed for you to collect and send your C’elle menstrual stem cells for processing and preservation , including a menstrual cup , collection tubes , prepaid FedEx airbill for return shipment to Cryo - Cell , and comprehensive instructions for use . "
The cells have yet to be tested in humans , and there are already concerns that banking your baby 's cord blood might not be as helpful as you 'd like to think .
While the medical community supports public banking of cord blood , it ( along with many governments ) has reservations about private banking .
The European Union Group on Ethics stated that ( pdf ) " the legitimacy of commercial cord blood banks for autologous use " — reimplantation into the same individual they came from — " should be questioned as they sell a service , which has presently , no real use regarding therapeutic options .
Thus they promise more than they can deliver .
The activities of such banks raise serious ethical criticisms . "
At present , MenSC therapies are even more limited — and the logic of paying money to store something many will see for several days every month is questionable — but both it and cord blood have great potential .
MenSCs are now being tested in pre-clinical ( non-human ) studies related to potential cardiovascular , diabetes and neurodegenerative human therapies .
Who 's got her back ?
A startling ally is calling on Senator Clinton to resist suggestions that she consider abandoning the presidential race : Ralph Nader , the independent presidential candidate who arguably cost Al Gore the presidency in 2000 .
Nader has released a statement reacting to comments by Sen. Patrick Leahy ( D - Vt. ) suggesting an apparently insurmountable lead by Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill . ) :
" Senator Clinton :
" Just read where Senator Patrick Leahy is calling on you to drop out of the Presidential race .
Believe me .
I know something about this .
Here ’s my advice :
Do n’t listen to people when they tell you not to run anymore .
That ’s just political bigotry .
" Listen to your own inner citizen First Amendment voice .
This is America .
Just like every other citizen , you have a right to run .
Whenever you like .
For as long as you like .
" It ’s up to you , Hillary .
Just tell them —
It ’s democracy .
Get used to it .
" Yours truly , Ralph Nader "

Oprah's Big Give Gets the Big Boot
Oprah felt like she got the message out there .
It was not something she wanted to renew . "
ABC is not renewing 's Big Give for a second season this coming fall .
The queen of talk shows is not upset by the news and during a conference call , a rep for Oprah had this to say :
The only message we got from watching the Big Give is that the people involved did n't know how to work together .
Seemed like your run of the mill reality show where everyone is fighting to get their 15 minutes of fame - good or bad .
The concept was great but the contestants actions spoke volumes and not in a positive way .
Big Give was n't the only show to get the cut .
Cashmere Mafia , Men in Trees , and Women 's Murder Club have all been dropped .
ABC will premiere a new , yet to be named show .
Celebrities involved with the project will be Aston Kutcher and Tyra Banks .
The preliminary information is billing the new offering as " a beauty pageant like no other . "
Kutcher and Banks seem like an unlikely match up .
Time will tell .
Many creatures that we are familiar with are venomous or poisonous .
Perhaps because they have not produced a large number of human fatalities we are not warned of their dangers .
Nevertheless it is wise to know what these creatures are capable of doing .
This is a list of the 10 animals you did n’t know were venomous or poisonous .
They are in no particular order .
10 . Cuttlefish
The cuttlefish is closely related to the squid and octopus .
It has 10 arms covered with tiny suckers and at the base is their beak .
This beak injects a fast acting venom which is not harmful to humans .
The venom works by attacking the victim ’s nervous system .
9. Hooded Pitohui
A songbird from New Guinea .
Its skin as well as feathers contain a very powerful poison called : homobatrachotoxin .
This is the same poison found in the South American dart frogs , although it is severely less toxic then the frogs and a whole bird would have to be eaten for any real harm to occur .
The poison is transferred easily to humans by merely touching or handling the bird .
8. Duck - Billed Platypus
The male platypus has a spur located on the heel behind each leg .
Their venom is not known to be deadly to humans .
The venom is produced only by mature males and is most potent during mating season , leading some researches to believe that it is used primarily against competing males .
7. Gila Monster
The Gila Monster is one of only two known venomous lizards ; it can be found in southwest USA and Mexico .
The Gila Monster ’s venomous bite is different than most animals , in that most of its teeth have grooves that conduct the flow of the poison .
Also rather than an injecting bite , the venom flows from these grooves and is injected through chewing .
They are rarely fatal to humans .
6. Centipede
The centipede is very common in the US .
Its body is made up of up to 150 segments with a pair of legs for each segment .
The head has long antennae and a pair of large claw like structures .
These claws carry the venom glands .
While centipedes are for the most part not fatal to humans , some of the large or giant species can be very dangerous to children .
5. Millipede
Closely related the centipede , some millipedes emit poisonous liquid secretions or hydrogen cyanide gas through microscopic pores on their body .
Some of these substances are caustic and can burn the exoskeleton of ants and other insect predators , and the skin and eyes of larger predators .
4. Cone Snail
The cone snail ’s harpoon is a modification of the radula , an organ in molluscs which acts as both tongue and teeth .
The harpoon is hollow and barbed , and is attached to the tip of the radula inside the snail ’s throat .
When the snail detects a prey animal nearby , it turns its mouth - a long flexible tube called a proboscis - towards the prey .
The harpoon is loaded with venom and , still attached to the radula , is fired from the proboscis into the prey by a powerful muscular contraction .
The venom paralyzes small fish almost instantly .
The snail then retracts the radula , drawing the subdued prey into the mouth .
The cone snail ’s bite is similar to a bee sting , but the larger species are responsible for 30 known cases of human death .
3. Slow Loris
The Slow Loris is one of the few mammals which is venomous .
In addition , it is the only mammal which is both venomous and poisonous at the same time .
Slow lorises produce a toxin on the inside of its elbows which it smears on its young to prevent them from being eaten .
In addition it will lick these patches to put the poison in its mouth , giving it a venomous bite used for self defense .
2. Komodo Dragon
While they do not technically produce venom , their diet consists of pretty much anything dead and that creates a special mixture of deadly bacteria build up in their mouths .
Their saliva contains more than 50 types of bacteria and 7 are highly septic and 4 have no known specific antidote .
However , if treated with powerful antibiotics , it proves non-fatal to humans .
1. Coral
There are many types of coral and a few of these have toxic chemicals that are not fully researched yet .
The most deadly coral is the Palythoa .
It can kill a rabbit with only a 25 nanogram injection .
To kill a human would only take 4 micrograms .
Palytoxin is considered one of the most toxic organic poisons .
Symptoms of palythoa poisoning include chest - pains , difficulty breathing , racing pulse and low - blood pressure .
Death occurs within minutes , and there is no treatment .

Located in desert of Turkmenistan is one of the most amazing landscapes in the world .
I know it looks like a lava - filled whole but it ’s really nothing like that , it ’s a man made crater dating back to the 1950s when the soviets were prospecting for natural gas .
The strangest thing about it is it ’s been burning ever since , that ’s 58 years of continuous burn .
Locals say animals are mesmerized by the flames as well , groups of thousands of spiders have been spotted plunging into the flames , as well as moths and birds .
This is a one of a kind attraction and tourists say it ’s worth the 3 our drive through the desert .

Waves of XO speed
One major complaint about One Laptop Per Child 's XO laptop , is the speed of its Geode LX 700 CPU that runs at 433 mhz .
Most experienced computer users find it a little slow , and often compare it to computing in the late 90's .
On the other hand , OLPC 's target market , children in the developing world who do n't have a Dell or Xbox for comparison , do n't seem to mind .
Still , for the serious geek , there is an easy fix for a slow processor : overclocking .
That is making the processor run faster than it 's designed to do .
Now , thanks to bdleonard on OLPC News XO Hacks Forum , we have directions on how to overclock your XO laptop :
Overclocking of the Geode LX processor is easily accomplished by writing to a specific MSR ( Model Specific Register ) .
This is easily accomplished at the open firmware prompt .
To get to the open firmware prompt you press ( the X in the upper left hand corner of the keyboard ) immediately after booting the OLPC .
Type " 4c000014 " and press Type " rdmsr " and press Type " u. " and press ( a hex number will be displayed )
Again , type " u. " and press ( a second hex number will be displayed , write it down )
Now its time to overclock .
For this to work , you must have a developer key , or have previously disabled security on your OLPC .
XO CPU drag racing
Now before you get , overclocking a CPU is n't without risk - it may cause stability problems , data errors , and possibly hardware damage , and will generate excessive heat , a concern with the passively cooled XO laptop .
Overclock at your own risk .
Regardless of your bravery , check out the results achieved by GoremanX :
I did some informal testing to see what speed improvements I get with overclocking .
I 've been able to run reliably at 566/233 ( 6e1 ) under Ubuntu from an SD card .
For the record .
566 mhz is a 30 % improvement in processor speed over the stock 433 mhz , and 233 mhz is a 40 % improvement in memory speed over 166 mhz .
On average , I saw a 21.8 % improvement in usable system speed at these overclocked ratings .
In my opinion , Ubuntu ran much more smoothly and responsively at 566/233 .
I did not notice if battery life was noticeably affected .
With usage speeds jumping like that , soon we 'll have Geode LX 700 drag racing !

Scientists call it the Naked Photo Test , and it works like this : say a photo turns up of you nakedly doing something that would shame you and your family for generations .
Bestiality , perhaps .
Ask yourself how many people in your life you would trust with that photo .
If you 're like the rest of us , you probably have at most two .
Even more depressing , studies show that about one out of four people have no one they can confide in .

# 1 . We do n't have enough annoying strangers in our lives .
That 's not sarcasm .
Annoyance is something you build up a tolerance to , like alcohol or a bad smell .
The more we 're able to edit the annoyance out of our lives , the less we 're able to handle it .
The problem is we 've built an awesome , sprawling web of technology meant purely to let us avoid annoying people .
Do all your Christmas shopping online and avoid the fat lady ramming her cart into you at Target .
Spend $ 5,000 on a home theater system so you can see movies on a big screen without a toddler kicking the back of your seat .
Hell , rent the DVD 's from Netflix and you do n't even have to spend the 30 seconds with the confused kid working the register at Blockbuster .
Get stuck in the waiting room at the doctor ?
No way we 're striking up a conversation with the smelly old man in the next seat .
We 'll plug the iPod into our ears and have a text conversation with a friend or play our DS .
Filter that annoyance right out of our world .

Now that would be awesome if it were actually possible to keep all of the irritating shit out of your life .
But , it 's not .
It never will be .
As long as you have needs , you 'll have to deal with people you can't stand from time to time .
We 're losing that skill , the one that lets us deal with strangers and tolerate their shrill voices and clunky senses of humor and body odor and squeaky shoes .
So , what encounters you do have with the outside world , the world you can't control , make you want to go on a screaming crotch - punching spree .

# 2 . We do n't have enough annoying friends , either .
Lots of us were born into towns full of people we could n't stand .
As a kid , maybe you found yourself in an elementary school classroom , packed in with two dozen kids you did not choose and who shared none of your tastes or interests .
Maybe you got beat up a lot .
But , you 've grown up .
And if you 're , say , a huge Dragon Force fan , you can go find their forum and meet a dozen people just like you .
Or even better , start a private room with your favorite few and lock everybody else out .
Say goodbye to the tedious , awkward , painful process of dealing with somebody who 's truly different .
That 's another Old World inconvenience , like having to wash your clothes in a creek or wait for a raccoon to wander by the outhouse so you can wipe your ass with it .
The problem is that peacefully dealing with incompatible people is crucial to living in a society .
In fact , if you think about it , peacefully dealing with people you can't stand is society .
Just people with opposite tastes and conflicting personalities sharing space and cooperating , often through gritted teeth .
Fifty years ago , you had to sit in a crowded room to see a movie .
You did n't get to choose ; you either did that or you missed the movie .
When you got a new car , everyone on the block came and stood in your yard to look it over .
You can bet that some of those people were assholes .
Your parents , circa 1982
Yet , on the whole , people back then were apparently happier in their jobs and more satisfied with their lives .
And get this :
They had more friends .
Yet , on the whole , people back then were apparently happier in their jobs and more satisfied with their lives .
And get this :
That 's right .
Even though they had almost no ability to filter their peers according to common interests ( hell , often you were just friends with the guy who happened to live next door ) , they still came up with more close friends than we have now - people they could trust .
It turns out , apparently , that after you get over that first irritation , after you shed your shell of " they listen to different music because they would n't understand mine " superiority , there 's a sort of comfort in needing other people and being needed on a level beyond common interests .
It turns out humans are social animals after all .
And that ability to suffer fools , to tolerate annoyance , that 's literally the one single thing that allows you to function in a world populated by other people who are n't you .
Otherwise , you turn emo .
Science has proven it .
# 3 . Texting is a shitty way to communicate .
I have this friend who uses the expression " No , thank you , " in a sarcastic way .
It means , " I 'd rather be shot in the face . "
He puts a little ironic lilt on the last two words that lets you know .
You ask , " Want to go see that new Rob Schneider movie ? "
And , he 'll say , " No , thank you . "
So one day we had this exchange via text : Me : " Hey , do you want me to bring over that leftover chili I made ? "
Him : " No , thank you " That pissed me off .
I 'm proud of my chili .
It takes four days to make it .
I grind up the dried peppers myself ; the meat is expensive , hand - tortured veal .
And , now my offer to give him some is dismissed with his bitchy catchphrase ?
I did n't speak to him for six months .
He sent me a letter , I mailed it back , unread , with a dead rat packed inside .
It was my wife who finally ran into him and realized that the " No , thank you " he replied with was not meant to be sarcastic , but was a literal , " No , but thank you for offering . "
He had no room in his freezer , it turns out .

So did we really need a study to tell us that more than 40 percent of what you say in an e-mail is misunderstood ?
Well , they did one anyway .
How many of your friends have you only spoken with online ?
If 40 percent of your personality has gotten lost in the text transition , do these people even really know you ?
The people who dislike you via text , on message boards or chatrooms or whatever , is it because you 're really incompatible ?
Or , is it because of the misunderstood 40 percent ?
And , what about the ones who like you ?
Many of us try to make up that difference in sheer numbers , piling up six dozen friends on MySpace .
But here 's the problem ...
# 4 . Online company only makes us lonelier .
When someone speaks to you face - to - face , what percentage of the meaning is actually in the words , as opposed to the body language and tone of voice ?
Take a guess .
It 's 7 percent .
The other 93 percent is nonverbal , according to studies .
No , I do n't know how they arrived at that exact number .
They have a machine or something .
But we did n't need it .
I mean , come on .
Most of our humor is sarcasm , and sarcasm is just mismatching the words with the tone .
Like my friend 's " No , thank you . "
You do n't wait for a girl to verbally tell you she likes you .
It 's the sparkle in her eyes , her posture , the way she grabs your head and shoves your face into her boobs .
That 's the crux of the problem .
That human ability to absorb the moods of others through that kind of subconscious osmosis is crucial .
Kids born without it are considered mentally handicapped .
People who have lots of it are called " charismatic " and become movie stars and politicians .
It 's not what they say ; it 's this energy they put off that makes us feel good about ourselves .
When we 're living in Text World , all that is stripped away .
There 's a weird side effect to it , too : absent a sense of the other person 's mood , every line we read gets filtered through our own mood instead .
The reason I read my friend 's chili message as sarcastic was because I was in an irritable mood .
In that state of mind , I was eager to be offended .
And worse , if I do enough of my communicating this way , my mood never changes .
After all , people keep saying nasty things to me !
Of course I 'm depressed !
It 's me against the world !
And worse , if I do enough of my communicating this way , my mood never changes .
After all , people keep saying nasty things to me !
Of course I 'm depressed !
It 's me against the world !
No , what I need is somebody to shake me by the shoulders and snap me out of it .
Which leads us to No. 5 ...
# 5 . We do n't get criticized enough .
Most of what sucks about not having close friends is n't the missed birthday parties or the sad , single - player games of ping pong with the wall .
No , what sucks is the lack of real criticism .
In my time online I 've been called " fag " approximately 104,165 times .
I keep an Excel spreadsheet .
I 've also been called " asshole " and " cockweasel " and " fuckcamel " and " cuntwaffle " and " shitglutton " and " porksword " and " wangbasket " and " shitwhistle " and " thundercunt " and " fartminge " and " shitflannel " and " knobgoblin " and " boring . "
And none of it mattered , because none of those people knew me well enough to really hit the target .
I 've been insulted lots , but I 've been criticized very little .
And do n't ever confuse the two .
An insult is just someone who hates you making a noise to indicate their hatred .
A barking dog .
Criticism is someone trying to help you , by telling you something about yourself that you were a little too comfortable not knowing .
Above : A flamboyant transvestite with about
five times as many friends as the average person Tragically , there are now a whole lot of people who never have those conversations .
The interventions , the brutal honesty , the , " you know , everybody 's pissed off because of what you said last night , but nobody wants to say anything because they 're afraid of you , " sort of conversations .
Those horrible , awkward , wrenchingly uncomfortable sessions that you can only have with someone who sees right to the center of you .
E-mail and texting are awesome tools for avoiding that level of honesty .
With text , you can respond when you feel like it .
You can measure your words .
You can pick and choose which questions to answer .
The person on the other end can't see your face , ca n't see you get nervous , ca n't detect when you 're lying .
You have almost total control and as a result that other person never sees past your armor , never sees you at your worst , never knows the embarrassing little things about yourself that you can't control .
Gone are the common quirks , humiliations and vulnerabilities that real friendships are built on .
Browse around people 's MySpace pages , look at the characters they create for themselves .
If you 've built a pool of friends via a blog , building yourself up as a misunderstood , mysterious Master of the Night , it 's kind of hard to log on and talk about how you went to prom and got diarrhea out on the dance floor .
You never get to really be yourself , and that 's a very lonely feeling .
And , on top of all that ...
# 6 . We 're victims of the Outrage Machine .
A whole lot of the people still reading this are saying , " Of course I 'm depressed !
People are starving !
America has turned into Nazi Germany !
My parents watch retarded television shows and talk about them for hours afterward !
People are dying in meaningless wars all over the world ! "
But how did we wind up with a more negative view of the world than our parents ?
Or grandparents ?
Back then , people did n't live as long and babies died more often .
Diseases were more common .
In those days , if your buddy moved away the only way to communicate was with pen and paper and a stamp .
We have Iraq , but our parents had Vietnam ( which killed 50 times more people ) and their parents had World War 2 ( which killed 1,000 times as many ) .
Some of your grandparents grew up at a time when nobody had air conditioning .
All of their parents grew up without it .
We are physically better off today in every possible way in which such things can be measured ... but you sure as hell would n't know that if you 're getting your news online .
Why ?
Well , ask yourself :
If some music site posts an article called , " Fall Out Boy is a Fine Band " and on the same day posts another one called , " Fall Out Boy is the Shittiest Fucking Band of the Last 100 Years , Say Experts , " which do you think will get the most traffic ?
The second one wins in a blowout .
Outrage manufactures word - of - mouth .
The news blogs many of you read ?
The people running them know the same thing .
Every site is in a dogfight for traffic ( even if they do n't run ads , they still measure their success by the size of their audience ) and so they carefully pick through the wires for the most inflammatory story possible .
The other blogs start echoing the same story from the same point of view .
If you want , you can surf all day and never swim out of the warm , stagnant waters of the " are n't those bastards evil " pool .
Actually , if you count the guy holding the camera , this man
statistically has more friends than most of us do .
Only in that climate could those silly 9/11 conspiracy theories come about ( saying the Bush administration and the FDNY blew up the towers , and that the planes were holograms ) .
To hear these people talk , every opposing politician is Hitler , and every election is the freaking apocalypse .
All because it keeps you reading .
9/11 photos .
Circled : Conspiracy
This was n't as much a problem in the old days , of course .
Some of us remember having only three channels on TV .
That 's right .
Three .
We 're talking about the ' 80s here .
So there was something unifying in the way we all sat down to watch the same news , all of it coming from the same point of view .
Even if the point of view was retarded and wrong , even if some stories went criminally unreported , we at least all shared it .
That 's over .
There effectively is no " mass media " any more so , where before we disagreed because we saw the same news and interpreted it differently , now we disagree because we 're seeing completely different freaking news .
When we can't even agree on the basic facts , the differences become irreconcilable .
That constant feeling of being at bitter odds with the rest of the world brings with it a tension that just builds and builds .
We humans used to have lots of natural ways to release that kind of angst .
But these days ...
# 7 . We feel worthless , because we actually are worth less .
There 's one advantage to having mostly online friends , and it's one that nobody ever talks about :
They demand less from you .
Sure , you emotionally support them , comfort them after a breakup , maybe even talk them out of a suicide .
But knowing someone in meatspace adds a whole , long list of annoying demands .
Wasting your whole afternoon helping them fix their computer .
Going to funerals with them .
Toting them around in your car every day after theirs gets repossessed by the bank .
Having them show up unannounced when you were just settling in to watch the Dirty Jobs marathon on the Discovery channel , then mentioning how hungry they are until you finally give them half your sandwich .
You have so much more control in Instant Messenger , or on a forum , or in World of Warcraft .
The problem is you are hard - wired by evolution to need to do things for people .
Everybody for the last five thousand years seemed to realize this and then we suddenly forgot it in the last few decades .
We get suicidal teens and scramble to teach them self - esteem .
Well , unfortunately , self - esteem and the ability to like yourself only come after you 've done something that makes you likable .
You ca n't bullshit yourself .
If I think Todd over here is worthless for sitting in his room all day , drinking Pabst and playing video games one - handed because he 's masturbating with the other one , what will I think of myself if I do the same thing ?
The Sad Bear # 3 , by Nedroid
You want to break out of that black tar pit of self - hatred ?
Brush the black hair out of your eyes , step away from the computer and buy a nice gift for someone you loathe .
Send a card to your worst enemy .
Make dinner for your mom and dad .
Or just do something simple , with an tangible result .
Go clean the leaves out of the gutter .
Grow a damn plant .
It ai n't rocket science ; you are a social animal and thus you are born with little happiness hormones that are released into your bloodstream when you see a physical benefit to your actions .
Think about all those teenagers in their dark rooms , glued to their PC's , turning every life problem into ridiculous melodrama .
Why do they make those cuts on their arms ?
It 's because making the pain - and subsequent healing - tangible releases endorphins they do n't get otherwise .
It 's pain , but at least it 's real .
That form of stress relief via mild discomfort used to be part of our daily lives , via our routine of hunting gazelles and gathering berries and climbing rocks and fighting bears .
No more .
This is why office jobs make so many of us miserable ; we do n't get any physical , tangible result from our work .
But do construction out in the hot sun for two months , and for the rest of your life you can drive past a certain house and say , " Holy shit , I built that . "
Maybe that 's why mass shootings are more common in offices than construction sites .
It 's the kind of physical , dirt - under - your - nails satisfaction that you can only get by turning off the computer , going outdoors and re-connecting with the real world .
That feeling , that " I built that " or " I grew that " or " I fed that guy " or " I made these pants " feeling , can't be matched by anything the internet has to offer .
Except , you know , this website .
David Wong is the Senior Editor of Cracked.com and the author of the dongtacular horror novel John Dies at the End , available wherever books are sold or by clicking those words .
This guys do a good thing .
They grow bears , treat them as pets ( who did n’t dream about having a bear as a pet , at least in Russia ? ) , and then release them to the wild nature .
They treat them in such a way that small bears learn to get the food by themselves and do n’t trust other humans so that not to get in trouble in their future wild life .
Scroll down for a video too .

When American Astronomer Clifford Stoll speaks , you ca n’t really help yourself but listen .
He may look and sound like a total nutcase , but take the time to listen to what he has to say , you ’ll be glad you did .
For the next 18 minutes , you ’ll be listening to Mr. Clifford as he talks about things such as the atmosphere of Jupiter , computers in classrooms , KGB hackers , and many , many other things .
Asking a men such as him to stay focused on a single subject would be pure folly , because as he says : “ Once I do something , I want to do something else . ”
Enjoy the presentation !

Over the last few months as the subprime lending situation has grown increasingly worrisome , a lot of people have written to me asking some very fundamental questions about what ’s going on .
I ’ve decided to collect all of these responses into a single post .
Please note that this is not a be - all end - all explanation of how the United States economy works , nor does it capture all of the nuances .
This is intended as a layman ’s explanation so that an individual can hear a news report in the mainstream media about the Federal Reserve or about the subprime crisis and know generally what ’s going on .
It ’s also based on my own understanding of macroeconomics and a ton of research I ’ve done lately – I do n’t claim that it ’s infallible , and I ’m quite sure that someone will correct or expand on a detail or two in the comments .
So , let ’s dig in .
The Federal Reserve and The Subprime Crisis
1 . What is the Federal Reserve ?
What do they do ?
The Federal Reserve ( sometimes called the Fed ) refers to the central banking system of the United States .
It basically serves as the interface between the government and private banks , like Bank of America or Citibank or your local bank .
In the words of the Federal Reserve Act , the law that authorizes the existence of the Federal Reserve , the purpose of the Federal Reserve is :
To provide for the establishment of Federal reserve banks , to furnish an elastic currency , to afford means of rediscounting commercial paper , to establish a more effective supervision of banking in the United States , and for other purposes .
The primary reason the Federal Reserve was created was to avoid banking panics .
Banking panics are pretty familiar to anyone who has ever heard stories of the Great Depression , when all of the customers of a bank would line up and try to take out all of their deposits at once .
If the bank did n’t have that much cash on hand – and often it would n’t – the bank would be forced to close and simply not return deposits to investors .
This caused some serious mistrust of the banking industry , for obvious reasons – I can say , for example , that my grandfather still refused to use a bank as late as the 1980s because he was so jilted by banking panics in the 1930s .
The recent mess with Bear Stearns was a near - miss of a banking panic , for example .
2 . What power does the Federal Reserve have to stop such panics ?
The Federal Reserve has several powers that they can use to prevent such panics from ever happening again .
First , they control the money supply .
If a bank is about to run out of money because the customers are demanding all of their money , the Federal Reserve can print more money ( they can print less money , too ) .
This has a bad effect over the long run ( I ’ll talk about that later ) , but over the short run , it can keep a bank afloat and maintains the trust that people have in putting their money into banks .
Second , they control the federal funds rate .
The federal funds rate is the interest rate that private banks can charge other banks on short term loans , usually overnight loans .
Although the actual process is somewhat more complicated , it essentially works like this : Bank A and Bank B are both operating in the same town .
Bank B has several customers wanting to make withdrawals today and they do n’t have enough cash just sitting there to cover all the withdrawals .
So Bank B asks Bank A for a quick overnight loan so that the withdrawals can be covered .
The interest rate on that loan is ( more or less ) determined by the Federal Reserve and is known as the federal funds rate .
More or less ?
The actual truth is that the Federal Reserve itself lends out money at a slightly higher rate , called the discount rate .
Any bank can borrow from the Federal Reserve at the discount rate , which means that it ’s the default rate that banks can get for those quick overnight loans .
Other banks will compete with that rate on the open market by offering a lower rate if they think it ’s worthwhile , and the Federal Reserve uses a big bag of tricks to encourage banks to lend among themselves at a rate very close to the lower federal funds rate .
The Federal Reserve has a lot of other powers , too , but those are among the biggest .
3 . Why does it matter when the federal funds rate goes up or down ?
As a general rule of thumb , a lower federal funds rate means that it ’s much easier for banks to carry on their normal business .
They can lend with more confidence , knowing that if the depositors come around wanting withdrawals , they can borrow the money back pretty cheap .
A higher rate means that banks are more cautious about lending money .
As a result , the Federal Reserve usually cuts their rates when the economy is starting to look weak ( encouraging more loans ) and usually raises the rates when the economy is starting to look strong ( encouraging more conservative loans ) .
4 . Why would the Fed ever want to raise rates if it makes the economy worse ?
Think about your own life – one year , you might buy a car and a new living room set , but then you wo n’t buy anything over the next few years .
This is probably affected by a lot of things – your feelings about how secure you are in your job , how the economy is doing in general , and so on .
If you lose your job , for instance , you ’re not going to be buying a new car .
The reverse of this is true , too .
When people are buying , companies are doing well – they ’re hiring more people and posting great earnings reports .
However , when people stop buying , companies usually have to tighten their belts .
This creates a cycle , something that happens in any economy .
It goes up , it goes down .
If the Federal Reserve just dropped rates to the floor , the economy would take off like a rocket and we ’d have several years of a booming economy .
After that , though , we ’d be in a 1929 position all over again – many years of exuberance would leave a lot of consumers content with their big purchases and a lot of companies with overvalued stock prices as a result of that exuberance .
In other words , a crash .
In order to prevent such a crash , the Federal Reserve moves to slow things down when they start really rolling along .
They do that by raising the interest rates , so that companies can’t borrow money quite so easily and thus ca n’t quite run as efficiently as they might otherwise run .
It protects us ( theoretically ) from another Great Depression .
5 . What is a subprime mortgage ?
First of all , let ’s look at what a “ prime ” mortgage is .
A “ prime ” mortgage is one that a bank is willing to offer to someone that they view as being trustworthy and highly likely to repay the mortgage without difficulty – someone with a steady , high income and a good credit rating .
The term “ prime ” actually refers to the prime lending rate , which is an interest rate that most banks agree upon to use ( yes , another different interest rate ) .
The prime lending rate is usually close to 3 % higher than the federal funds rate – right now , the federal funds rate is 2.25 % and , thus , the prime rate is 5.25 % .
If you ’re a trustworthy borrower , that 5.25 % rate is approximately ( not exactly in any way , shape , or form , but a guideline ) what you should get on a mortgage right now .
Subprime mortgages are those offered to people who are deemed not as trustworthy , usually people with a less reliable income or a lower credit rating .
These are people who are pretty likely to repay , but it ’s not quite as clear cut .
In order to help make up for that increased risk , many banks offered all sorts of special loans to these borrowers , usually at higher interest rates .
ARMs were one particular option – they would have a great interest rate at first , but would adjust to a very high interest rate over time .
In order to sell more mortgages , many companies started offering these “ subprime ” loans quite easily , often loaning higher amounts to people at low income levels .
For example , I was able to get a prime mortgage for a little less than double my family ’s annual income , but I could have received a subprime loan for about four and a half times my family ’s annual income .
6 . How is that a bad thing ?
The emergence of subprime mortgages had several effects .
First of all , it increased the number of people who could buy homes very quickly , and it also increased the amount of money that people could get to buy homes .
That meant there were a flood of potential home buyers in the late 1990s to mid 2000s .
This caused the prices on the homes to rise – if there ’s an increase in demand , the supply ’s going to change to match that .
( I ’m simplifying a bit here , I know . )
Eventually , though , tons of new homes were being built , which increased the supply .
Also , people were now sitting in subprime mortgages that were adjusting to rates that they could n’t afford , so they were either not able to keep their house or they were walking away from them .
So , now you have two problems : the housing market is in bad shape because supply is higher and demand is lower , and there are people out there holding onto mortgages that are now very difficult for them to pay .
7 . How does this affect big banks ?
At this point , a lot of people are simply walking away from their subprime mortgages – they ’re not paying the bills and letting the bank take their house .
They have monthly payments that are too high for them to cover and thus they ’re simply being foreclosed on for failure to pay their mortgage .
Other owners are realizing that their houses are now worth less than they paid for them and , in some cases , the house is worth less than what they still owe on their mortgage , so some of these people are simply walking away , too , and letting the bank foreclose on their houses .
A big bank would much rather have a mortgage with a nice fat interest rate on it than a house with a low value on it .
Every time a person walks away from a mortgage , the bank is force into trading that mortgage for that lower - value house .
When you hear about subprime lending losses , this is where the losses start at .
The big problem is that these losses multiply .
Whenever a person walks away from a mortgage , that loss does n’t just affect whatever company actually holds the mortgage .
It also affects everyone who is invested in that mortgage holder , and that ’s a lot of people .
That ’s because home mortgages were previously seen as a rock - solid investment for investors , and thus a lot of different investment firms would invest their money in home mortgages , seeing it as being a very stable place for their money .
Suddenly , that most stable of places is looking pretty risky and coughing up losses .
That ’s how Bear Stearns got into trouble .
They had a lot of their money invested in supposedly stable mortgages , but when people started walking away from those mortgages , suddenly Bear ’s most stable investments were losing money pretty quickly .
If that ’s coupled with an investment in the stock market – a risky investment that ’s also down right now – all of a bank ’s investments could be losing money rapidly .
This creates a domino effect .
Suddenly , banks stop trusting each other .
If all of the other banks are losing money like gangbusters , why would you want to give that bank an overnight loan ?
It ’s not really very safe to do so , so many banks become very hesitant to loan out a dime to each other .
That ’s very bad .
It ’s those overnight loans that make it possible for banks to conduct business – to lend money to entrepreneurs and companies and individuals who need the cash to keep their businesses and lives going .
This is the so - called “ credit crunch ” that you keep hearing about on the news .
This , coupled with a long series of foreign policy initiatives not liked by most of the rest of the world , is also why the dollar is losing value against the rest of the currencies in the world .
Think about it – from the eyes of someone outside of America , would you rather own a Euro – backed by nations that are n’t in a foreign policy fiasco and are n’t dealing with this subprime mess ( at least not directly ) – or a dollar , which comes from a nation with these problems ?
I know which one I would probably view as being more stable , and I ’m an American .
8 . What ’s next ?
In response to all of this , the Federal Reserve has been cutting the federal funds rate like crazy to encourage banks to lend money to each other .
They ’ve also made it much easier for banks to borrow money from the Federal Reserve at that discount rate mentioned above – they ’re letting banks borrow the money for up to ninety days and have made more money available in this fashion than ever before .
In other words , the Federal Reserve is trying to stabilize this mess .
What does it mean for you ?
It means that most investments are pretty awful at the moment – over the long haul , they ’ll probably rebound as this crisis works itself out .
Inflation is going up because the Federal Reserve is pumping money into the economy right now ( those “ discount rate ” loans ) – that ’s why you ’re paying higher prices at the grocery store , because with more dollars out there , an individual dollar is worth less than it used to be .
Housing prices will certainly drop in the near future as all of this flushes out – that ’s why it ’s probably a good time to buy a house over the next few years .
Thankfully , banks are learning from this .
It ’s not a path they want to go down again , because this has been very dangerous for their business .
It ’s almost hard to get a prime mortgage now , and actual subprime mortgages are very hard to find .
My suggestion is be patient .
If you ’re investing for the long haul , now is as good a time as any to buy most investments , but if you ’re looking at the short term , it ’ll be pretty bumpy .
If you ’re looking to buy a house and have good credit , now ’s a great time to start looking .
Otherwise , now ’s a great time to build up an emergency fund and
use other tactics that are appropriate for any downturn in the economy .
Let ’s say you ’re out with your buddies ( or maybe a lovely young lady ) having a good time , when all of a sudden some jackass shoves you .
You did n’t do anything to instigate the guy , but it does n’t matter .
There is a special breed of males , that when inebriated , start fights with random people .
This breed , when found in their wild habitat , are often accompanied by their similarly boneheaded buddies .
Or perhaps you and your posse end up in a rumble with the Socs because one of your buddies killed a Soc while trying to save Ponyboy from being drowned by a douche bag Soc. Man , I hate them Socs.
Stay golden Ponyboy .
What can you do to prepare for a street brawl and protect yourself in this type of situation ?
Here are 8 simple steps you can follow to avoid ending up in the emergency room after a street fight .
1 . Wake up !
When someone threatens you , snap to attention .
Be aware of your environment .
Look for objects that you can use for weapons .
Searching out a place to escape to is especially important if you ’re outnumbered .
2 . Try to defuse the situation .
Try to talk with the guy and calm him down .
If you did something unknowingly that offended him ( like looking at him funny ) , then apologize .
Do n’t let your ego get in the way of apologizing for something you did n’t do .
Your first goal should be to avoid fighting .
Maintain confident body language .
Do n’t show the guy you ’re afraid .
Listen to our podcast on dealing with aggressive people :
3 . Walk away .
If talking to the knucklehead does n’t work , start to leave the scene .
But maintain alertness and walk away backwards , still facing your opponent .
If he ’s a no - good , yellow - belly rat , he ’ll attack you from behind .
4. Assume a fighting position .
If the jerk is still threatening you and you have nowhere to go , assume a stable fighting stance .
Spread your stance to about shoulder width - apart and slightly bend your knees .
The goal is to maintain balance so you do n’t end up on the ground .
Keep your hands up to protect your face and clench your teeth .
A solid punch to an open mouth can lead to a broken jaw .
5. Defend yourself .
The goal is to defend yourself from violent and unjustified aggression , so do n’t be afraid to fight dirty .
If you have any object to use as a weapon , use it .
This can be anything like a chair , a bottle ( extra man points for first breaking the bottle and then thrusting the jagged part at your opponent ) , or a 2X4 .
Here are some other techniques that could be used in this sort of situation :
Knee to the groin .
No explanation needed as to why this is effective .
No explanation needed as to why this is effective .
Low kicks to the knee , groin , or abdomen .
Kick like you ’re kicking down a door , using the bottom of you foot .
A solid kick to one of these areas can incapacitate your attacker long enough for you to get away .

Headbutt to the face .
Your forehead is one of the hardest bones on your body .
Use this to your advantage by headbutting your opponent hard across his nose .
If done correctly , you can do some serious damage .

Throw a punch .
If done correctly , an overhand punch can put your attacker out of commission .
Listen to our podcast on when violence really is the answer :
6 . Take punches effectively .
While you should do your damnedest to avoid getting punched , you ca n’t avoid them all .
If you have to take a punch , strive to absorb it in a way that minimizes the impact and damage ..
A punch to the head .
Move towards the punch , tighten your neck muscles and clench your jaw .
By moving into the punch , your attacker may miss the mark wide to either side .
Absorb the punch with your forehead ( remember how hard it is ? ) .
If your attacker hits you there , his hand will be hurting , and you ’ll have minimized the damage to yourself .

A punch to the body .
Tighten your stomach muscles , but do n’t suck in your stomach .
Try to shift so the punch lands on your obliques rather than directly in the stomach or vital organs .
7 . Give your best war cry .
While defending yourself , make as much noise as possible .
There are two reasons for this .
First is the intimidation factor .
Yelling may distract and intimidate your attackers , leaving you a better chance of getting in some good blows or getting away .
The second reason is to draw attention .
The more people who gather around you , the easier to call a douche bag ’s bluff .
8 . Make your escape .
After you have incapacitated your attacker using the methods described above , get the hell out of there .
KABUL ( Reuters ) - Afghan President Hamid Karzai escaped unhurt on Sunday from an assassination attempt by Taliban fighters who fired guns and rockets at an official celebration near the presidential palace in Kabul .
Karzai , government ministers , former warlords , diplomats and the military top brass ducked for cover after gunfire sounded at the event to mark the 16th anniversary of the fall of the Afghan communist government to the mujahideen .
Karzai later addressed the nation on state television .
“ Today , the enemies of Afghanistan , the enemies of Afghanistan ’s security and progress tried to disrupt the ceremony and cause disorder and terror , ” he said .
“ Afghanistan ’s military forces surrounded them quickly and arrested some of the suspects . ”
Three people were killed -- a parliamentarian , the head of a minority group and a 10 - year - old child -- and 10 were wounded , officials said .
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack and said three of its fighters were killed .
British ambassador Sherard Cowper - Coles was standing on the front row of the dais alongside the U.S. envoy to Kabul .
“ It was coming to the end of the 21 - gun salute .
I saw an explosion and a puff of dust to the left of the parade and then heard the crackle of small - arms fire from all directions , ” he told Reuters .
“ My bodyguard frog - marched me away . ”

All cabinet members and foreign diplomats at the parade along with General Dan McNeill , U.S. commander of international forces in Afghanistan , were safe and well , spokesmen said .
TALIBAN ATTACKERS KILLED
NATO condemned the attack and said it would make no difference to the alliance ’s involvement in Afghanistan .
“ NATO will continue to support the Afghan Government and people in defending their security and their democracy , ” Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said in a statement .
The Taliban fire appeared to come from a building a few hundred meters ( yards ) from the site , a road which is blocked off for official parades , close to the presidential palace .
“ Three of our attackers have been killed and three managed to escape .
Small arms and RPGs ( rocket - propelled grenades ) were used in the attack , ” Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told Reuters from an undisclosed location .
The attack disproved Afghan government and NATO assertions that the Taliban insurgency has been weakened , he said .
“ Afghan and NATO authorities this year repeatedly said the Taliban are on the verge of annihilation ...
Now it is has been proved to them the Taliban not only have the ability to operate in the provinces , but even in Kabul , ” said Mujahid .

“ Karzai and his cabinet ca n’t be safe from Taliban attacks . ”
Immediately after the attack , bandsmen in full dress uniform and ordinary soldiers scrambled to get out of the line of fire .
Other soldiers and Karzai ’s bodyguards , dressed in black , took up firing positions on roads near the parade ground .
Karzai has survived several assassination attempts since he came to power after U.S. - led and Afghan forces toppled the Taliban in late 2001 for failing to hand over al Qaeda leaders behind the September 11 attacks on the United States .
But Taliban insurgents regrouped and relaunched their insurgency two years ago and now fight daily battles with Afghan and foreign troops , mainly in the south and east , and have launched scores of suicide attacks throughout the country .
U.S. - led forces killed several militants on Saturday in a raid northeast of Kabul targeting a man involved in bomb attacks who was planning to disrupt ceremonies on Sunday .
Several civilians were wounded in the ensuing battle in which artillery and air strikes were called in , the U.S. military said .
Karzai has repeatedly offered to hold peace talks with the Taliban , but the hardline Islamist militants have said they will fight on till they topple him and drive out the more than 50,000 foreign troops based in Afghanistan .
Bank bail - outs to be kept secret
The Bank of England has imposed a permanent news blackout on its £ 50 bn - plus plan to ease the credit crunch .
' Lesser of two evils ' : The Bank of England will guard the names of credit - crunch banks with unprecedented levels of secrecy .
Ferocious and unprecedented secrecy means taxpayers will never know the names of the banks that have been supported through the special liquidity scheme , which was unveiled by Bank Governor Mervyn King last week .
Requests under the Freedom of Information Act are to be denied .
Details will be kept secret even after 30 years - the period after which all but the most sensitive state documents are released .
Any Bank of England employee leaking the names of institutions involved will face court action for breach of contract .
Even a figure for the overall amount advanced will not be published until October .
Meanwhile the Bank is expected to issue at least £ 50bn of Treasury bills to banks in exchange for their mortgages - entirely in secret .
This hypersensitive official stance is thought to be a response to the events of last year when a huge stigma was attached to any lender suspected of going to the Bank for cash help .
The scheme is intended to steady the markets , but it is feared that reports of banks making widespread use of the facility could trigger further instability .
Barclays and HBoS have both confirmed they will use the Bank of England scheme .
' We welcome the Bank facility and we will participate in it , ' confirmed Andy Hornby , chief executive of HBoS .
Other banks declined to comment , but it is expected that this week all of the leading banks , with the exception of Lloyds TSB , will tender some of their mortgages to the Bank of England .
HBoS confirmed last week it had packaged up £ 9bn of mortgages ready either for securitisation - in effect , selling them on in the wholesale financial markets - or to be offered to the Bank in return for Treasury bills .
The scheme , drawn up by King and approved by Chancellor Alistair Darling , aims to improve banks ' liquidity by temporarily swapping bundles of mortgages and credit card debt for Treasury bills , which are short - dated Government debt that matures within nine months .
The scheme will run for three years so these bills will be replaced by new ones when required .
Under the plan , bills will be exchanged only for securities rated triple - A - the highest possible grade of security - by at least two of the three big ratings agencies , Fitch , Moody 's and Standard & Poor's .
It would not normally be considered acceptable for big companies to arrange billions of pounds of financial support without telling their shareholders .
But one source close to major institutional investors said : ' I can see why there may be a case for secrecy .
It may be the lesser of two evils . '
The £ 50bn or more of Treasury bills involved will dwarf the £ 17.6 bn currently in issue , but the authorities are adamant this will not destabilise the Government debt market .
The recent selection of Bob Barr as the presidential nominee by the Libertarian Party ( LP ) at it ’s convention in Denver has caused much controversy .
Most moderates are happy , most radicals are upset , some to the point of leaving the party .
Before addressing the future of the LP let ’s take a look at some of the troubling aspects of Mr. Barr ’s conservatism .
One of the best gauges of his thinking is to be found at his sidekick , Richard Viguerie ’s , website
ConservativeHQ.com
.
The first thing one notices is that the website is n’t titled LibertarianHQ.com as would befit a website of those seeking to lead the LP .
Delving a little deeper one finds this
page
explaining their view of conservatism .
While they make many good points they seem to take a very liberal vs. conservative or Republican vs. Democrat point of view .
One gets the sense that they define conservative as anti-liberal .
Libertarians do n’t see themselves as standing with conservatives against liberals .
This page then goes on to define different kinds of conservatives .
Libertarians are included with this short description :
Libertarian conservatives seek to reduce the size , cost , and intrusiveness of government .
They say to bureaucrats and politicians :
" Leave us alone ! " and " Mind your own business ! "
Libertarians proudly refuse to recognize political reality .
But , within the ranks of conservatives , libertarianism serves a necessary and critical function : it is the brake in the train of conservatism .
By libertarian conservative standards , every proposal must be measured as to whether it will ultimately strengthen or weaken Big Government .
Ronald Reagan referred to libertarianism as " the heart of conservatism . "
Somehow this libertarian does n’t see libertarianism as part of the conservative movement , but a movement of its own .
Conservatives embrace government to one degree or another while libertarians reject government to varying degrees .
This is a crucial difference .
Neoconservatives are often former liberals and democratic socialists who have acknowledged the failure of liberalism and socialism to solve society ’s problems , in the sense of the old saying , " A neoconservative is a liberal who 's been mugged . "
Most older neoconservatives are former members of the branch of liberalism and democratic socialism associated with New York intellectuals ; they rebelled against policies that condoned or promoted Communism .
Neoconservatives tend to emphasize scientific analysis of the success or failure of government programs – for example , by statistical studies of whether " welfare , " " affirmative action " discrimination , broad restrictions on gun ownership , and other policies actually improve the lives of the people they are supposed to help .
They believe the U.S. should play a leading role in world affairs , especially in defense of beleaguered democracies such as Israel .
They favor strong action to promote the spread of democracy in the world , noting that constitutional democracies rarely – or , by some measures , never – fight wars against each other .
( In recent years , many critics of the Bush Administration have used the term " neoconservative " to refer to anyone who supported the Iraq War and related endeavors . )
If anything , this long description understates the neoconservative infatuation with big government and empire .
As Irving Krystal wrote in "
The Neoconservative Persuasion
" , " Neocons do not feel that kind of alarm or anxiety about the growth of the state in the past century , seeing it as natural , indeed inevitable . "
This is just socialism under another name .
The mere fact that they consider neocons to be conservatives and worthy of being associated with shows that they do n’t get it .
How anyone thinks libertarians are supposed to live in the same big tent with neocons is incomprehensible , there is absolutely no place in the LP for them .
Recovering neocons are welcome in the party to learn about our philosophy , but not to lead it .
That said , the LP should welcome libertarian leaning conservatives .
They should be the minority though .
It should be the conservatives holding their noses about libertarian positions they do n’t like when supporting our candidates .
That the situation is now reversed and libertarians have to hold their noses about many of Mr. Barr ’s positions is unacceptable .
These major policy positions I refer to are :
First , Mr. Barr ’s support for a national sales tax .
While his call for the end of the income tax and the repeal of the 16th Amendment are great , his call for a replacement tax makes this a big shell game .
If Mr. Barr is truly an advocate of less government why does he think the revenue lost by ending the income tax needs to be replaced ?
Second , the war on drugs .
Putting aside Mr. Barr ’s past transgressions , and they are many , he has only called for a partial end to this , namely legalizing marijuana .
This leads to the 3rd area of disagreement , his call for stepped up interdiction of drugs in South America .
( On May , 28 , 2008 the article "
No Way To Treat a Friend
" was removed from the BobBarr08 website , it can still be found
here
. ) Mr. Barr may call for a non interventionist foreign policy on his website , but that is contradicted by the above .
What ’s a libertarian to do ?
Some , such as
Christine Smith
, have chosen to leave the LP .
With all due respect I must disagree with her point of view and hope that she reconsiders .
Now is not the time to abandon the battle .
Now is the time for radical libertarians to stay with or return to the LP .
The conservatives worked long and hard to get where they are now in the party .
We must do the same to win it back .
That ’s the only way the LP will ever be libertarian again .
I ’ve been following the podcasts that Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky have been doing for StackOverflow .
The podcasts are not really technical in nature , in fact they really do not have anything to do with what will ultimately be the purpose of the site they are building .
They are more documenting the discussions and decisions they are making while creating the site .
I ’ve only been through the first few so far , but an interesting discussion has come up in both podcasts about whether or not programmers should know the C programming language .
Jeff does not know C and seems to come down on the side of the argument that this knowledge is not necessary .
Jeff has n’t specifically said this out loud , that I ’ve heard , but I gather this is his opinion based on how the conversation seems to flow .
Joel , on the other hand , is of the opinion that programmers should have knowledge of the lower levels of programming even though it is not part of their daily job .
His thinking on this is that the lower level knowledge gives programmers an edge even when programming with the higher level popular programming languages of today .
I have to agree with Joel on this .
In my experience working with programmers in both categories , those who have a background of knowledge of the lower level programming languages always seem to be quicker at solving more complicated problems .
Of course , there are exceptions to this rule but I would say 98 % of the time this is true .
It is interesting also that when this topic comes up with colleagues , it is almost split right down the line in opinion with those who do not know C believing it is not necessary and those who do have experience with C believing this sort of experience and knowledge makes them a much better developer .
One good example supporting my argument ( actually Joel ’s argument ) is garbage collection related issues .
I ’ve seen programmers spend a huge amount of time attempting to understand why the runtime memory size of their program is continuing to grow when , in their minds , the garbage collector should be coming to the rescue .
Of course , the problem is usually that they somehow have a reachable reference to a huge collection of objects or something of this nature ( usually several in fact ) .
Programmers with the lower level knowledge seem to pick up on these sorts of problems much quicker .
Another area I have seen many issues with is threading .
Languages like C# and Java make threading a reachable concept for the programming masses .
This is a good thing unless you do not understand the underlying concepts of threading .
I cannot begin to calculate how many conversations I have had with programmers concerning the thread safety of their methods .
I also cannot count the number of blank stares I have received when I ask about the concept of thread safety in interviews .
I know that most will say that I am bringing up edge case problems that are not normal in business programming .
I am willing to concede that .
However , I also agree with Joel ’s approach in that I tend not to hire programmers that do not have this knowledge because it happens often enough to be a problem .
There are exceptions , but those programmers are “ exceptional ” .

Sami al - Haj is a free man today , after having been imprisoned by the U.S. military for more than six years .
His crime : journalism .
Targeting journalists , the Bush administration has engaged in direct assault , intimidation , imprisonment and information blackouts to limit the ability of journalists to do their jobs .
The principal target these past seven years has been Al - Jazeera , the Arabic television network based in Doha , Qatar .
In November 2001 , despite the fact that Al - Jazeera had given the U.S. military the coordinates of its office in Kabul , U.S. warplanes bombed Al - Jazeera ’s bureau there , destroying it .
An Al - Jazeera reporter covering the George Bush - Vladimir Putin summit in Crawford , Texas , in the same month was detained by the FBI because his credit card was “ linked to Afghanistan . ”
In spring 2003 , the U.S. dropped four bombs on the Sheraton hotel in Basra , Iraq , where Al - Jazeera correspondents — the only journalists reporting from that city — were the lone guests .
Another Al - Jazeera staffer showed his ID to a U.S. Marine at a Baghdad checkpoint , only to have his car fired upon by the Marines .
He was unhurt .
That ca n’t be said for Tareq Ayyoub , an Al - Jazeera correspondent who was on the roof of the network ’s bureau in Baghdad on April 8 , 2003 , when a U.S. warplane strafed it .
He was killed .
His widow , Dima Tahboub , told me : “ Hate breeds hate .
The United States said they were doing this to rout out terrorism .
Who is engaged in terrorism now ? ”
Then there is the story of Sami al - Haj .
A cameraman for Al - Jazeera , he was reporting on the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan .
On Dec. 15 , 2001 , while in a Pakistani town near the Afghanistan border , Haj was arrested , then imprisoned in Afghanistan .
Six months later , shackled and gagged , he was flown to the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay .
Haj was held there for close to six years , repeatedly interrogated and never charged with any crime , never tried in a court .
He engaged in a hunger strike for more than a year , but was force - fed by his jailers with a feeding tube sent into his stomach through his nose .
Haj was abruptly released this week .
The U.S. government announced that he was being transferred to the custody of Sudan , his home nation , but the government of Sudan took no action against him .
He was rushed to an emergency room , and soon was seen on his old network , Al - Jazeera :
“ I ’m very happy to be in Sudan , but I ’m very sad because of the situation of our brothers who remain in Guantanamo .
Conditions in Guantanamo are very , very bad , and they get worse by the day .
Our human condition , our human dignity was violated , and the American administration went beyond all human values , all moral values , all religious values .
In Guantanamo , you have animals that are called iguanas , rats that are treated with more humanity .
But we have people from more than 50 countries that are completely deprived of all rights and privileges , and they will not give them the rights that they give to animals . ”
He described the desecration of the Quran as part of the effort to break him : “ They hold the Quran in contempt , destroyed it several times and put their dirty feet on it .
They also sat on the Quran while trying to get us angry .
They repeatedly committed violations against our dignity and our sexual organs . ”
At least one official in the Defense Department has denied the charges .
Asim al - Haj , Sami ’s brother , told me in an interview last January about the 130 interrogations : “ During these times , the interrogations were all about Al - Jazeera and alleged relations between Al - Jazeera and al - Qaida .
They tried to induce him to spy on his colleagues at Al - Jazeera . ”
According to the Committee to Protect Journalists , 10 journalists have been held for extended periods by the U.S. military and then released without charge .
Just weeks ago in Iraq , the U.S. military released Pulitzer Prize - winning Associated Press photographer Bilal Hussein after holding him without charge for two years .
The military had once accused Hussein of being a “ terrorist media operative who infiltrated the AP . ”
The committee reports that 127 journalists and an additional 50 media workers have been killed in Iraq since 2003 , well more than twice the number killed in World War II .
We need to remind the Bush administration : Do n’t shoot the messenger .

Non ci siamo dimenticati della storia di quelle donne svedesi che qualche mese fa rivendicavano il diritto di andare nelle piscine pubbliche in topless :
Leggo oggi su repubblica .
it che il fronte del topless danese , ispiratosi al piu famoso già citato ha vinto una importante battaglia in questo senso :
d ’ora in avanti alle donne di Copenhagen sarà permesso nuotare e andarsene in giro per le piscine pubbliche della città in topless .
La commissione Cultura e Tempo Libero ha votato il provvedimento a schiacciante maggioranza ( … )
I 've been thinking about economists .
We are a different breed , I think , at least in one sense .
We see markets everywhere .
Thinking of getting married ?
We see a marriage market where partners rationally look at the costs and benefits of a " partnership " and decide accordingly .
It is all very sterile and scientific , nothing more than supply and demand , like always .
Thinking of going for a walk in the woods ?
We can model that choice , it 's fairly simple .
It has an opportunity cost , and a benefit , and if the benefit exceeds the cost , the walk will be taken .
In fact , all of the " apparently noneconomic dimensions of society " are no match for the economist :
Gary S. Becker ... sheds new light on previously unconnected and poorly understood social phenomena .
...
His singular axiom - that all actors in the social game are economic persons who maximize their advantages in different cost situations - allows Becker to study persistent racial and sexual discrimination , investment in human capital , crime and punishment , marriage and divorce , the family , drug addiction , and other apparently noneconomic dimensions of society .
There are very few choices that cannot be reduced to the language of economics .
There are , after all , markets in everything !
But maybe economists are people for whom this way of thinking is attractive .
People choose their majors , they are not assigned randomly , and for some people this " economic way of thinking " is very natural ( and for some it is quite foreign - explain as you will , it just does n't seem to " click " with them ) .
The first time you see a problem explained with economic tools you say , yes , that 's it - that 's how people make decisions because when you look inside , it explains how you see the world .
And even where you had n't viewed the world through the eyes of economics before , you suddenly have new insights .
Aha !
Now I understand how people choose to get married !
Paul Zak gave a seminar yesterday and it made me wonder if economists might , as a group , have some sort of hormonal deficiency , a bad Oxytocin gene or something .
Oxytocin is thought to increase trust between humans :
Oxytocin is a hormone which is released during many experiences , including birth in women .
In the brain , oxytocin is involved in social recognition and bonding .
Oxytocin appears to be the ' social glue ' that holds entire families , communities and societies together , without needing the government to monitor transactions .
Empathy for others begins with the release of oxytocin , which compels feelings of love .
When we feel trusted , our brains release oxytocin .
This , in turn , causes us to recriprocate the ' trusted ' feeling .
With an added dose of oxytocin , subjects ' generosity to strangers increased up to 80 % .
Generosity to strangers ?
With no benefit for me ?
That can't be right , it does n't fit our models .
Here 's something I found interesting , In Zak 's experiments with Oxytocin , there was always one group of people who did n't play the game the same way others played .
In the game :
178 students ... were separated into groups of investors and trustees , who were not allowed to communicate with each other .
Each investor began the experiment with a fund equal to about five Swiss francs that could be invested with a trustee .
Any investment would be automatically tripled .
The trustee then could decide how much , if any , of the money would be paid to the investor .
Both investor and trustee could take home cash at the conclusion of the experiment , based on how they managed the investments .
The more the trustee withheld , the larger his final cash payoff .
By design , the investors were caught in a dilemma .
If they trusted their partners and invested the maximum allowable , they might reap triple their investment .
But they could just as easily lose everything if betrayed by a partner who decided to keep all the proceeds .
...
The researchers found that the volunteers who took oxytocin were twice as likely to risk all their money with a stranger .
...
Moreover , the hormone only affected someone 's response to another person .
Those who engaged in financial trading with a computer partner showed no effect from the hormone ...
So , summarizing , we both start with $ 10 .
If you send me all of your money , I then have $ 10 + three times what you sent me = $ 40 and you will have nothing .
If I send you back anything more than $ 10 but less than $ 30 we will both be better off .
In general , people were willing to trust the other person , and trust increased when Oxytocin was administered .
Most of the time , the trust was rewarded .
But there was one group of students with Oxytocin levels that were clear outliers ( excessive amounts indicating their receptors were likely inactive ) who never gave anything back to the person who had trusted them - they pocketed the $ 40 ( or three times whatever they were sent plus the original $ 10 ) and whistled all the way to the bank .
They were the exception though , most did choose to give something back so that the gains were shared .
But it is not in their self - interest to do so .
Update :
Here 's the graph I was referring to :
[ One other interesting feature .
If the first person sent less than 30 % , i.e. less than $ 3.00 , people did not tend to send anything back .
It was as though the second person said you idiot , we have this great opportunity to make money , yet you wo n't trust me to hold up my end ? - I 'll show you by keeping the money . ]
So here 's what I wonder .
Are economists , as a group ( and perhaps libertarians foremost among them ) , more like the students who acted purely according to self - interest ?
Did they choose to become economists because when they looked inside at their own decisions , this model of the world - the one where people always follow their self - interest - fit ?
Do we have a chemical make - up that causes us to see self - interest as a primary , dominating emotional force in all decisions ?
Is that why we have a hard time understanding things like pure altruism ?
The Federal Reserve 's Term Auction Facility , TAF , has failed to produce the intended results - encourage more bank to bank lending at reduced rates .
That should not be too surprising .
If the Fed is willing to be a " swapper of last resort , " why should banks risk lending to each other ?
After all , bank - to - bank loans are unsecured .
Who wants that risk , especially when banks have every reason not to trust each other ?
Please see Failures of the Term Auction Facility for detailed analysis of this situation .
CLOs Pawned Off To The FED
Now things are getting even crazier at the Fed 's Swap - O - Rama as Buyout CLOs Are Being Used for Fed Loans .
Wall Street firms may be bundling high - yield , high - risk corporate loans into securities to use as collateral to borrow from the U.S. government , according to a report by Morgan Stanley analysts .
Securities firms can borrow against collateralized loan obligations at the Federal Reserve 's Primary Dealer Credit Facility , the analysts said .
The Fed set up the facility last month , its first extension of credit to non-banks since the Great Depression .
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. , the fourth - largest U.S. securities firm , last month created the $ 2.8 billion Freedom CLO , the largest this year , out of loans that could n't be readily sold to investors , such as for buyouts of payment processor First Data Corp . and power producer TXU Corp. JPMorgan Chase & Co. , Deutsche Bank AG and Barclays Plc also underwrote CLOs in March , according to data compiled by Bloomberg .
They 're also " an easy way for banks to reduce balance sheet risk , which indirectly helps reduce capital requirements , by funding the AAA through the Fed and selling the equity , which provides high yield to investors , " said Peter Plaut , an analyst at hedge fund Sanno Point Capital Management in New York .
March Pool Stats
25.3 % 60 day delinquent or worse
13.35 % Foreclosure
4.44 % REO

When music label EMI announced Monday that it would offer high - quality digital music downloads free of copy protection , Apple CEO Steve Jobs basked in the early public relations glow , thanks to his canny call a month ago for the labels to abandon digital rights management technologies .
But while Apple scored a public relations coup by offering EMI 's DRM - free tracks through iTunes , the company has also struck a major blow against Microsoft in a less obvious arena : music encoding standards .
In an early morning press release , EMI announced the immediate availability of its " digital repertoire " in high - quality , DRM - free AAC format .
The new tracks will be encoded at 256 Kbps , EMI officials said , instead of the 128 Kbps that most iTunes tracks use .
" By providing DRM - free downloads , we aim to address the lack of interoperability which is frustrating for many music fans , " said EMI Group CEO Eric Nicoli in the press release .
Apple 's iTunes Store is the first to receive the new premium downloads , which will be priced at $ 1.30 .
Apple will continue to offer DRM - shackled tunes from EMI at the lower rate of 128 Kbps for the usual price of $ 1. EMI stressed that DRM would remain on music bought under monthly flat - fee - based services such as Rhapsody , Napster and Yahoo Music Unlimited .
A large part of the news has to do with consumers ' excitement over the " unprotected " part of the equation , since DRM restrictions are often seen as onerous , unfair and contrary to the fair - use provisions of U.S. copyright law .
In fact , many observers , including Wired News , have predicted that 2007 would be the year that music labels begin offering higher - quality , DRM - free music .
This week 's announcement will surely cheer the champions of music sold without copy restrictions .
Still , the removal of DRM is just one piece of the puzzle ; of equal significance to the online music industry is EMI 's choice of AAC encoding .
Many onlookers had assumed that the company would go with the widely supported MP3 format .
The decision to use AAC represents a crack in the wall that has separated services and devices that use Microsoft 's WMA from those that use AAC .
All digital audio players support MP3 , but users who want a more efficient audio compression than MP3 and / or the ability to buy music online have had to choose between AAC and WMA .
While AAC is an industry standard , Apple has been its primary champion .
( AAC is part of the MPEG suite of standards , which includes MP3 , and is based on patents owned by AT&T , Fraunhofer , Dolby Laboratories and Sony , and is licensed by a Dolby subsidiary ) .
Apple 's iPod has long supported the AAC format , which is used by the ITunes Store .
Apple normally adds a layer of DRM copy protection , called FairPlay , to the music files sold there .
In the past year , several other manufacturers have added AAC support to their players , including Microsoft , SanDisk and Sony .
However , the software used to load these players with music from CDs does n't default to AAC , the way Apple 's iTunes does , and no store has existed where owners of those devices can buy music in the AAC format , the way iPod owners have been able to at the iTunes Store .
That 's about to change , now that Apple and EMI have doubled down on AAC as their unprotected format of choice .
Once Apple starts selling music from EMI – and possibly other labels – in the unprotected AAC format , manufacturers will scramble to add AAC support to their devices , because consumers will need their devices to play music purchased from iTunes .
Other music stores could start adopting the AAC format as well , as EMI implied when it called iTunes " the first online music store to sell EMI 's new downloads . "
" This is an opportunity for manufacturers to make devices that could be compatible with major media services including iTunes , " said Susan Kevorkian , an audio analyst for IDC .
" That process becomes more and more appealing with every major label that chooses to go that route , and we expect that others will . "
MP3 took a black eye in February when a federal jury hit Microsoft with a $ 1.52 billion patent - infringement award , to the benefit of Alcatel - Lucent , which holds patents on key components of the MP3 encoding and decoding process used by Microsoft and many other companies .
The case has raised a cloud of uncertainty over the format , raising the fortunes of alternatives such as AAC .
Luckily for consumers and manufacturers , the audio decoder chips found in most MP3 players are already able to decode the AAC format , even if they do n't support it out of the box .
By installing a simple firmware upgrade , users of most music players can upgrade their gadgets to support the files .
Where does this leave Microsoft and its partners ?
Stores and devices that support WMA suffered a serious blow when Microsoft launched its Zune music player without PlaysForSure support .
A Microsoft representative indicated that the company was willing to listen to consumers , even if it was n't ready to announce its own DRM - free music solution .
" Consumers have indicated this is important to them , so Zune has been working with a variety of partners to head in this direction , " the Microsoft rep said .
" This is a time of transition for the music industry and Microsoft is committed to striking a balance between delivering the best consumer experience while still protecting the rights of the content owners . "
Now , developers and manufacturers have a big incentive to go with AAC rather than WMA , which could cut WMA out of the larger digital music ecosystem .
Apple and EMI 's embrace of AAC spells an unlikely defeat for Microsoft at the hands of a technology that consumers did n't really use until Jobs got his hands on it .

McClellan : Plame leak the ' turning point ' in his disillusionment David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday May 29 , 2008

Print This Email This ( Update at bottom : Ex-spokesman reveals Bush authorized leaks , Plame blogger reports ) Former White House press secretary Scott McClellan has been blasted by the people he formerly worked with since the release of excerpts from his memoir of his years with the Bush administration .
Current press secretary Dana Perino released a statement saying , " Scott , we now know , is disgruntled about his experience .
...
It is sad -- this is not the Scott we knew . "
Karl Rove similarly told Fox News , " This does n't sound like Scott ... not the Scott McClellan I 've known .
...
It sounds like a left wing blogger . "
In his first interview since the firestorm broke , McClellan spoke on Thursday with NBC's Meredith Viera about his reasons for writing the book .
" It 's important to look back and reflect , " he stated .
" The White House would prefer that I not talk openly about my experiences , but I think there 's a larger purpose . "
McClellan indicated his doubts started early , when " we got to Washington , and I think we got caught up in playing the Washington game the way it 's played today . "
However , it was his unwitting role in the cover -up of the Valerie Plame leak that caused his final disillusionment and eventual resignation and provided " the launching - off point for the book . "
" By the last ten months or so of my time at the White House , I grew increasingly disillusioned by things , " McClellan told Viera .
" When the first revelation came out that what I 'd been told by Karl Rove and Scooter Libby -- that they were in no way involved in the leak of Valerie Plame 's identity , which we now know was not true , despite the fact that I went to the podium and said these people assured me they were not involved -- I started to become a little more disillusioned about things . "
" I have a higher loyalty than my loyalty necessarily to my past work , " McClellan explained .
" That 's a loyalty to the truth and it's a loyalty to the values I was raised on .
I talk about my upbringing in a political family that talked about the nobility of public service and the importance of speaking up and talking about making a positive difference .
I hope that this book will help do that . "
Vanity Fair points out one other striking passage from McClellan 's book , in which he states , " Its ... clear to me that Scooter Libby was guilty of the perjury and obstruction crimes for which he was convicted .
When the president commuted Libbys prison sentence and thereby protected him from serving even one day behind bars , I was disappointed .
This kind of special treatment undermines our system of justice . "
In contrast , Senator John McCain said of Libby last summer , before the commutation , " I think that you can make a case that he was singled out unfairly .
I think that the appeals process goes forward .
I happen to be one who admires Scooter Libby .
I think he was a dedicated servant . "
Ex-spokesman reveals Bush authorized leaks , Plame blogger reports Marcy Wheeler , who received prominent media attention during the Scooter Libby trial and who blogs under the pseudonym Emptywheel at the popular site firedoglake believes that McClellan " does n't know it yet " but he let a big cat out of the bag on the Today show .
Wheeler calls attention to this exchange : McClellan :
But the other defining moment was in early April 2006 , when I learned that the President had secretly declassified the National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq for the Vice President and Scooter Libby to anonymously disclose to reporters .
And we had been out there talking about how seriously the President took the selective leaking of classified information .
And here we were , learning that the President had authorized the very same thing we had criticized .
Viera :
Did you talk to the President and say why are you doing this ?
McClellan : Actually , I did .
I talked about the conversation we had .
I walked onto Air Force One , it was right after an event we had , it was down in the south , I believe it was North Carolina .
And I walk onto Air Force One and a reporter had yelled a question to the President trying to ask him a question about this revelation that had come out during the legal proceedings .
The revelation was that it was the President who had authorized , or , enable Scooter Libby to go out there and talk about this information .
And I told the President that that 's what the reporter was asking .
He was saying that you , yourself , was the one that authorized the leaking of this information .
And he said " yeah , I did . "
And I was kinda taken aback .
" Now , for the most part , this is not new , " emptywheel writes .
" We have known ( since I first reported it here ) that Scooter Libby testified that , after Libby told Dick Cheney he could n't leak the information Cheney had ordered him to leak to Judy Miller because it was classified , Cheney told Libby he had gotten the President to authorize the declassification of that information . "
She continues , " Thus far , though , we only had Dick Cheney 's word that he had actually asked Bush to declassify this information .
We did n't have Bush 's confirmation that he had actually declassified the information .
In fact , we 've had Dick Cheney 's claims that he -- Dick - - had insta-declassified via his super secret pixie dust declassification powers .
" But now we 've got George Bush , confirming that he , the President of the United States , authorized the leaks of ' this information , ' " Wheeler argues .

Did you ever tried to draw some forms in dark with the help of light ?
You must have noticed that when you draw something with light , you can create some shapes in the air .
Light Graffiti has come to fame over the last couple of years and there are quite a bit of amazing works to show on the internet demonstrating what can be achieved .
Light graffiti artists create unique tagging in air or sometimes around object in dimensional way and then images are clicked with time - lapse photography .
Sometimes this tagging is not even possible with spray paints .
Requirements for capturing light graffiti in your camera :
For capturing the light graffiti in your camera ; the most important accessory is tripod .
If you can not get a tripod make sure that your camera is in a fixed position .
You need to set your camera with faster shutter speed .
The exposure time should be around 10 - 30 seconds and this should vary with the lighting conditions .
Keep your aperture dumb , do not highlight the aperture and make sure to keep your aperture closed .
This controls the over exposure of the image .
Always prefer low ISO and stick to ISO 100 for better light graffiti .
If the lighting frequency is high , then attach a ND filter to cut down the unnecessary lighting .
Different light sources give you different colors of graffiti .
Glow stick can be used to give variety of color , xenon gives you warm golden lights , cathode tubes give you thick lines and LED gives you thin precise lines .
Here are 25 amazing collection of light graffiti pictures .

GTA IV has frame - rate and pop-up issues , says 1UP
According to a 1UP preview , GTA IV suffers from the same glitching and frame rate issues as its predecessors .
" You 'll likely notice the same graphical ' quirks ' that the series has dealt with since the jump to 3D .
The same filmlike , grainy framerate exists and usually holds steady , but it can momentarily dip when things get frantic , " the article says .
" There 's some long - distance graphical fade - in as well as some street - level hazards that appear only after you hit them .
Traffic will be nonexistent one second , then three cars deep when you rotate the camera back around , and then completely disappear when your wanted level gets to two or three stars ( which is oh - so - fun when you desperately need a getaway vehicle ) . "
However , this time round , Rockstar has made attempts to veil them .
" But even these problems have been ' upgraded ' in a sense for GTA4 :
An artistic application of filters hides some of the uglier character models , there 's more types of cars to choose from , and overall , the feel of the city trumps any of the shortcomings we 're familiar with by now .
But you 'll be able to see that in the screenshots and eventual videos . "
Say what you will about the fiascoes leading up to the Beijing Olympics , but the event has brought along with it some amazing new architecture .
Greeting visitors attending the Xicui entertainment complex near the site of the games is a 20,000 square foot wall of computer - controlled LEDs , the largest of its kind ever built .
Better yet , the wall manages to power itself completely using only the sun .

The GreenPix Zero Energy Media Wall , designed by Simon Giostra & Partners and Arup , uses thousands of solar capture cells attached to each of its glass panels to charge up during the day and then release dazzling light shows at night .
It 's the first time perforated photovoltaics laminated in glass have ever been used in a building in China , but if all goes off without a hitch , it most certainly wo n't be the last .

The wall is a combination of three textured panels in low - , medium - , and high - transparency glass , employed together to create a " continuous carpet " of flowing design that 's actually roughly 7 feet deep .
The wall will showcase low - resolution LED imagery , to help conserve energy and paint an artsy gauze on whatever does get shown .

The authorities said today that it appeared a case of mistaken identity had led the Federal Bureau of Investigation to search the former home and to interview the friends of a Saudi Arabian pilot whose name is similar to one used by one of the hijackers of American Airlines Flight 11 , the first plane to crash into the World Trade Center .
The search here on Wednesday was widely reported in the news media , including The New York Times , with several accounts reporting that the pilot was a suspected hijacker .
A lawyer with knowledge of the investigation said today that the man , Abdul Rahman Alomari , had returned to Saudi Arabia this month , and that both American and Saudi officials appear to be reasonably convinced that he is not the Abdulaziz al - Omari who was listed by the F.B.I. on Friday as one of the 19 hijackers .
The lawyer , as well as American and Saudi officials , all of whom spoke on the condition that they not be named , said Abdul Rahman Alomari had been interviewed by Saudi and United States authorities in Saudi Arabia in the last two days .
In the information age , software is more of a necessity than a luxury for businesses that know their worth .
Smart business owners leverage the right software to their advantage and gain an edge over their competitors .
They also use the same software to streamline business operations and increase productivity .
A huge chunk of most company ’s IT budget goes towards business software procurement .
Companies spend thousands of dollars every year on software for businesses .
With so much money at stake , it ’s more than devastating when a company buys a software it does n’t need .
That ’s why you should only buy business software after much deliberation and after talking to the right people .
To help you out with picking the right business software , we ’ve compiled important questions that you should ask to make the right choice .
1. Does Its Features Match Your Business Needs ?
Most software that accomplishes specific purposes in business has essentially the same features .
For instance , a point of sale ( POS ) software will read barcodes , give information about the product , add up the total cost of purchase , and print receipts .
Software like bookkeeping software , on the other hand , does n’t have the same features .
While features might vary , some bookkeeping software might have more features than others .
Not to say that you should go for the software with the most features .
Find software with features that are specifically useful to your business needs .
Look at each feature and see how it fits into your business operations .
If the features add value to your business operations and processes , then that ’s a software you can invest in .
2. Does the Software Come With a Satisfaction Guarantee ?
The software vendor is under no obligation to give you a refund if you ’re disappointed with the software .
However , some vendors have friendly return policies if you return the software within a specific time .
With such vendors , you may be able to get a partial or even full refund for your return .
Always inquire if there ’s a guarantee of satisfaction before purchasing any software .
That way , you can at least have some assurance that you wo n’t lose everything should the software fail to convert .
Ask if they have a return policy , and what terms dictate the return policy .
It ’s harder for custom - developed software developers to accept returns .
That ’s because it takes a lot of time and effort for the developer to craft the perfect software for you .
So if you want a satisfaction guarantee , you ’ll have to make it clear in the contract between you and the developer .
3. How Scalable
Is the Software ?
If your company grows , you want software that grows with your company .
That way , you do n’t have to spend more cash on software you already have when it ’s time to expand .
Not only is it expensive , but it also interrupts normal business operations .
To find out whether a business is scalable , you need to consider the following factors : -
If it allows user customization
The software database structure
The software connectivity capability
The software input and output
It will be frustrating when you realize that you ’ve outgrown a program and you ’ll have to purchase a new one .
Before you spend money on software , make sure it ’s scalable .
It ’s easy for custom - developed software to be scalable but not so much for off - the - shelf software .
4. How Long Does It Take to Fix Bugs ?
Even the best software have their fair share of bugs and errors , so when your software crashes , you have no reason to panic .
What you should panic about , however , is how the developer responds to these bugs and fixes .
Some companies will respond to any bugs or crashes instantly and send a team to address the issue as soon as they can .
Others will , however , note down the bugs and fixes you need and schedule a date that is convenient for them to check things out .
You ’re better off with a company that responds instantly to bugs and crashes .
However , if the software still works as it should , then a few bugs should n’t be such a problem .
If that ’s the case , then it ’s quite alright for the company to take their time to fix the bugs
Bug - fixing can happen yearly , bi-annually , or after every three months .
The period does n’t really matter as long as the software company stays true to its word .
Make sure you ask for the bug fixes turnaround time and their procedure for fixing bugs .
5 . When Is Support Available and How Do They Operate ?
Regardless of your IT setup , you might need support at some point to address issues with the software .
If your IT department had software developers , you would n’t have to outsource for business software .
Remember , business software support handles complex issues , not simple ones like how to speed up a mac .
Availability is the most important factor to consider when it comes to support .
Support should be available during working hours , if not twenty - four hours a day .
Apart from that , you should also find out how support operates and how do they communicate with their clients .
If you ’re able to reach support via phone calls and live chat , then the better it is for you .
It ’s hard to get any help from support if they have to respond through email .
Find out everything about support earlier on for some peace of mind when you finally buy the software .
Regular software updates mean the developer is keen about ensuring the users get the best out of the software .
Most of these updates also address bugs and errors in the software for an even smoother - running program .
Most business software developers inform their users whenever there ’s a new update .
Others have mailing lists for customers interested in software updates .
Both work fine ; just ensure the updates are consistent and actually add value to your company .
The Right Questions Equals the Right Software for Businesses
When it comes to software for businesses , do n’t be afraid to ask as many questions as you can .
Armed with the above questions , getting the right software for your business will be a breeze .
Always go for custom - developed software if you can match the price .
You ’re more likely to get what you want with custom - developed software .
Business software is n’t our only area of expertise .

Nice .
So in the space of 12 hours , Hillary has twice suggested that she ’d nuke Iran , but now her staff is saying that she did n’t mean to imply that she would .
Maybe she ’s just 60 years old and tired , like her husband said she was when she repeatedly lied about Bosnia for four months .
So long as foreign policy crises only happen when Hillary is well rested , and feeling honest , we should be fine .
I ’ve thought some more about this .
And jokes aside , this is serious .
Hillary Clinton misspoke today , twice , when detailing the possible use ofUS nuclear weapons in the Middle East as it concerns Iran and the defense of Israel .
This is an incredibly dangerous topic .
And she made a mess of it , repeatedly , to the point where her staff had to get involved to try to make amends , so that now our enemies and our allies have no idea what Hillary ’s position is on war with Iran , the defense of Israel , and the possible use of US nuclear weapons .
Even more disturbing is the possibility that Hillary made these comments , this apparent flip - flop on US nuclear policy , in order to curry favor with voters in Pennsylvania on the eve of that state ’s primary .
( I ’ve also heard speculation that Hillary ’s new nuclear policy is really about forcing Obama into some kind of bind , or something . )
This is n’t Bosnia any more , where you can send the First Lady in with a child , a singer and a comedian to read a poem .
It ’s a possible nuclear war scenario , and Hillary , in an effort to act all tough , win a few votes , and take a jab at Obama , played politics with our national security and sent the wrong message to the world , the wrong message to our enemies .
It ’s 3 am , folks , and the phone just rang .
And Hillary got it wrong .
Sometimes you hear great stories at preview events .
Like how at the THQ thing yesterday , I was talking to journalist to the stars Paul Semel right after the Gary Busey videos for Saint 's Row 2 aired , and he said something approximating the following :
" I was interviewing him once and asked him , what 's the craziest thing you ever snorted cocaine off of ?
He could n't think of anything , but afterwards his publicist called me and said , you know that question ?
And I thought , oh man , they want me to pull the question .
But no , they said that Gary remembered he had a better answer for me . "
Here 's what ran in Maxim :
What was the freakiest thing you ever snorted blow off of when you were a prominent coke fiend ?
I came home one day , took off my windbreaker , and three bindles of cocaine fell to the floor .
Well , my dog , Chili , who has short hair , came in and laid on her back with her legs in the air , and she rubbed all my cocaine on her back and side .
I yelled , " No , Chili ! No "
So I got a straw , and I started brushing her hair and snorting where I saw cocaine .
Back , butt , side – not a spot was left .
It took me 25 minutes to snort all the cocaine the dog had on her coat .
The fringe benefits of this were that the fleas , the dog hair , the mud , and the sweat went in my nose , too .
It 's not a good flavor coming off the dog .
Two more * Saint 's Row 2 * teaser videos starring the legendary actor and former prominent coke fiend can be found all over the Internet today .

Clarence Aaron is serving three consecutive life sentences without possibility of parole for a minor role in a drug conspiracy .
He has been in prison since December 1993 .
Since then , Clarence has been a model prisoner .
He has maintained a perfect behavior record and continually receives exceptional work evaluations .
Mr. Aaron had no previous criminal record .
He was a successful student and athlete , graduating from LeFlore Magnet High School in Mobile , AL .
He scored in the 74th percentile on the ACT .
He attended Mississippi Valley State University and later transferred to Southern University in Baton Rouge , LA , where he was attending on an athletic scholarship for football and was majoring in marketing .
During college , Clarence held a summer job through his membership with the International Longshoreman 's Association and participated in activities with his local Masonry Lodge .
Clarence is the only son of Linda Aaron .
In the summer before his final year at Southern University , Clarence was approached by a childhood friend from Mobile who asked Clarence if he knew of anyone who could supply him with cocaine .
Clarence knew of people who dealt drugs in Louisiana and helped his old friend by arranging a meeting with a drug dealer from Baton Rouge .
Distrustful of each other , the two parties insisted Clarence be present during their meeting .
Clarence foolishly agreed .
Following that incident , Clarence returned for his fourth year of studies at Southern University .
The next winter Clarence was pulled out of a class by F.B.I. agents and arrested .
He was charged with possession with intent to distribute nine kilograms of cocaine and attempting to possess with intent to distribute fifteen kilograms of cocaine .
His first trial ended in a hung jury .
Upon retrial , Clarence was convicted on the testimony of co-conspirators who got lenient sentences in exchange for their testimony against him .
In 1999 , Clarence was featured in the PBS Frontline documentary " Snitch , " about the use of informants in federal drug trials .
A juror in Clarence 's case who was interviewed in " Snitch " was shocked when he learned the length of Clarence 's sentence .
He thought Clarence should have received a sentence of only a few years .
On January 17 , 2001 , Rep. Sonny Callahan , the Member of Congress representing Mobile , asked President Clinton to consider granting a pardon for Clarence .

New figures bolster calls for shipping to be included in Kyoto Protocol .
Big polluter : ships emit about 4 % of the world 's carbon dioxide emissions .

The amount of carbon dioxide emitted by the world 's shipping industry is much higher than previously thought , according to the latest estimate from the United Nations .
The new figures , released on 8 February by the International Maritime Organization ( IMO ) , based in London , show that emissions from cargo ships are about twice those from global air travel .
The discovery has raised the volume of environmentalists ' calls for shipping to be included in a successor to the Kyoto Protocol , which expires in 2012 .
Like commercial aviation , emissions from shipping are not currently included in the Kyoto targets for reducing greenhouse - gas outputs .
According to the new figures1 , ocean - going freight tankers belch out 1.12 billion tonnes of CO 2 per year — roughly 4 % of the world 's overall output .
Most previous estimates put the figure at less than 2 % .
Global air travel , in contrast , is responsible for around 650 million tonnes of CO 2 each year , despite the fact that aviation has been the target of loud protests from campaigners angered by its exemption from Kyoto .
Overboard
Shipping emits less CO 2 than aviation on a per-vehicle basis , argues Ian Adams , secretary general of the International Bunker Industry Association , an organization based in the United Kingdom that represents the shipping industry .
" Cargo aircraft emit 673 grams [ CO 2 ] per tonne — kilometre but ships emit between 11 and 42 grams per tonne–kilometre , according to statistics developed by the International Chamber of Shipping and the ECSA [ European Community Shipping Association ] , " he told Nature News .
But attention is increasingly moving towards ocean freight and its possible inclusion in future national carbon targets .
The new figures were calculated with a more detailed method than before .
IMO experts divided the world 's 90,000 large shipping tankers into 70 categories , based on the number and type of engines , time spent sailing and type of fuel consumed .
This contrasts with the previous approach , which simply estimated the total fuel supplied to ships by oil refineries .
The figures also show that without moves to limit the growth of international shipping , the industry 's CO 2 emissions could grow by more than 30 % by 2020 , potentially reaching 1.475 billion tonnes .
The IMO says that the new figures will act as a wake - up call .
" The point is we 're trying to do something about emissions so we do n't get to that 2020 figure , " says a spokesperson .

Crossing borders
" Shipping is gradually realizing that it can't escape from the need to do something to address climate change , " says Peter Bosch , a member of the division of the International Panel on Climate Change that studies ways to reduce the effect of climate change .
However , he says that it will be difficult to incorporate shipping emissions into Kyoto targets because ships travel all over the world .
" It is a difficult sector to get hold of politically , " he says .
" International negotiations have been quite slow going . "
Many ships are registered under flags of convenience , and therefore have a different official nationality to the country that owns or profits from them .
" Where do you allocate [ the carbon emissions ] ? "
Bosch asks .
" The country making the money from the shipping , or the area where the emissions are made ? "

I 've written about CNN's Michael Ware on The Daily Banter before , disagreeing with his stance on the invasion of Iraq , but respecting his integrity as a journalist .
Ware 's stance on the American occupation is that the invasion has virtually destroyed Iraq , but troops should remain there to prevent further blood shed .
In his blog on ZNet.org , Chomsky answers a readers question on Ware , giving his own stance on the morality of withdrawing troops from Iraq .
Read the exchange below :
ZNet Sustainer : Michael
Ware who is the pointman for CNN in Baghdad , was on television explaining how surge is n't working and that Iraq is actually a " horrorshow , " but that we can not pull out any time soon , because if we did the violence would " soak Iraq in bloodshed . "
Sunni's and Shiites would kill each other and country would be destroyed .
Ware wants us to stay until Iraq is at least able to govern itself , which may take many more years , but that we have no choice , because our occupation destablized it and we have reponsibility to not let it go into anarchy .
Your take , what would happen if we left , and what could morally and legally be done to insure that the bloodshed Ware talks about will not happen .
I say this because Ware tends to be the only mainstream journalist who is actually in the streets of Iraq and sees what is actually going on , and at least to me , he seems trustworthy .
Give me and others your take , if you can ?
Thanks .
Noam Chomsky : I doubt that Ware has anything like the direct experience in Iraq of Nir Rosen , Patrick Cockburn , and the few other journalist who actually know the country well .
But put that aside .
The country already has largely been destroyed by the US invasion and its horrendous aftermath -- which Iraqis , rightly , blame on the invasion , as Pentagon studies recognize .
I do n't doubt that Rosen , Cockburn , and other knowledgeable observers would agree that the withdrawal of the occupying army would be followed by bloodshed , but according to the consistent judgment of Iraqis , repeatedly found in Western - run polls , their presence is a primary instigator of such violence .
The longer they stay , the worse it is likely to get .
There 's a good article on the " surge ' in the current issue of Foreign Affairs by Steven Simon , Senior Fellow for Middle Eastern Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations , formerly on the National Security Council , no leftist critic .
His quite plausible conclusion is that by its very design , the surge is " stoking the three forces that have traditionally threatened the stability of Middle Eastern states : tribalism , warlordism , and sectarianism , " and is sowing the seeds of future disaster for Iraq , quite likely laying the basis for rule by a military junta not unlike the Saddam regime .
Furthermore , it is sheer jingoist sentimentality to believe that the US has any interest in allowing Iraq to govern itself .
There is nothing in history or logic to suggest that , nor in current planning , with bipartisan support : the construction of the huge " Embassy , " a city within a city , and the enormous military bases around the country , all designed to be permanent , surely .
History , logic , and what is going on before our eyes indicate clearly enough that Washington has always intended to establish an obedient client regime in Iraq , and still does , and will do what it can to achieve that , whatever the further cost to Iraqis .
An independent Iraq could be a nightmare for US geostrategic objectives in the region .
Nir Rosen is right to conclude that there is no " solution " to the disaster caused by the US invasion , and that we can at most hope to contain the damage .
That means withdrawal of the invading army in a manner that is likely to cause the fewest additional blows to the society we have wrecked , while providing it with enormous reparations -- not aid , but reparations -- and holding the guilty accountable for their criminal acts .
It would be interesting , in this connection , to check back to see how much concern there was in the US over Russian withdrawal from Afghanistan , with the likelihood that it would lead to massacre and destruction by the US - backed terrorist forces -- as it did .

Doctors and people close to Senator Kennedy said that he would remain in the hospital for the next couple of days .
The doctors said he was “ in overall good condition ” and “ remains in good spirits and full of energy . ”
He has not had another seizure since he was hospitalized , they said .
“ Right now , he ’s his normal self , except for the news that he ’s dealing with , ” said a close friend who spoke on the condition of anonymity .
“ I bet he ’ll be back at the Cape sailing this weekend .
I expect he ’ll go back to work ” after the Memorial Day recess .
Senate Democrats and Republicans learned of Mr. Kennedy ’s condition as they were gathered for their weekly closed - door party luncheons , and members of both parties were visibly shaken by the news .
As he opened debate on the Iraq spending bill , Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia , at 90 the only current senator to serve longer than Mr. Kennedy , was distraught .
“ Ted , Ted , my dear friend , I love you and miss you , ” Mr. Byrd said in halting remarks on the floor .
Malignant glioma is the most common form of brain cancer , accounting for about 9,000 cases diagnosed each year in the United States , according to the National Cancer Institute .
They are more common in older people , especially those between the ages of 75 and 84 , according to the American Cancer Society .
The prognosis varies depending on the type and severity of the tumor , and the patient ’s age .
The American Cancer Society said that survival rates drop with increasing age .

Dr. Patrick Y . Wen , clinical director of the Center for Neuro - Oncology at the Dana - Farber Cancer Institute , said the average prognosis for the most aggressive type of glioma is 14 to 15 months , while the prognosis for slower - growing tumors is two to four years .
Anticlimactic as it is , your humble editor still missed this yesterday ; EA 's deadline for its offer to acquire Take - Two has passed .
Literally nothing happened .
No comments from either side , no offers to raise the share purchase price or extend the deadline , no Mark - Gastineau sack - dances by Take - Two 's board - in short , no comment from either side .
All we can deduce is that fewer than 50 percent of Take - Two shareholders liked the bid of $ 25.74 per share .
And since the stock closed at $ 27.10 Friday , that 's hardly a shock .

So ... now what ?
Analysts quoted in a Friday San Francisco Chronicle story still think the deal will get done .
Michael Pachter cited the Wall Street Journal story that places Rockstar 's Dan Houser in the pivot , as his contract with Take - Two is up next year and he 's open to EA ownership .
Pachter 's reasoning : Houser would broker the deal in hopes of being rewarded by his new employer .
EA talks about how GTA IV 's success was already built into its offer to Take - Two , so surely GTA IV 's success is already built into Take - Two 's relationship with Houser .
A grateful EA might be willing to throw in a premium Houser could n't negotiate otherwise .
Even though the deadline was not extended , as some suspected , that by itself does n't preclude another offer .
Weekend deadline negotiations are usually for labor unions and management .
They certainly are n't covered by amateurs like yours truly , or the Agence France Presse writer who called the game " Grand Theft Auto IV : Liberty City Stories . "
We 're not that well sourced .
Once the regular writers and analysts get back in the office this week , someone will say something .

Cruising is one of the best vacation values going .
The all - inclusive fare includes accommodations , meals and entertainment .
But did you know that cruise lines get most of their revenue from the things passengers buy aboard ship ?
Yep .
That ’s why they aggressively peddle their photos , spa services , art auctions , shore excursions , jewelry , casino and drinks of the day .
Do you really need that faux - gold - by - the - inch jewelry or another souvenir cocktail glass ?
If you ’re not careful , you can easily spend more for onboard extras than you did on the cruise fare .
The key to avoiding a bank - breaking bill is knowing what to expect .
Tipping .
Except on a few luxury cruise ships , which have no tipping required policies , you are expected to tip your cabin steward , dining room waiter and assistant waiter .
Do n’t fight it .
These crew members work very hard for low wages , and your tips are necessary to their livelihood .
Many lines recommend that each passenger tip on average about $ 13 per day , as follows : cabin steward , $ 5.50 ; dining room waiter and assistant waiter , $ 6.50 ( shared ) ; bistro service waiter and cooks , $ 1 .
Bar bills are automatically charged a 15 percent gratuity for the bartender .
Special service personnel such as the maitre ‘d , deck stewards and bellmen should be tipped as service is rendered ; for other crew tips , payment at the end of the cruise is customary .
Airport transfers .
The cost of a round - trip airport transfer purchased through the cruise line is often $ 60 per person or more .
A better ( and often faster ) way to get to and from the ship is by local taxi or Uber or Lyft .
The fare is usually around $ 30 for a cab and less for Uber and Lyft .
Best of all you can take up to four people .
Photo opps .
It starts before you even set foot on the ship , with the obligatory pose by the S.S. Life Preserver .
Ship photographers are everywhere — in the dining room , on the pool deck , in the showroom .
You ’ll feel like you are being stalked by paparazzi before you sit down to your first dinner .
But here ’s the thing :
You do n’t have to have your picture taken and you do n’t have to buy any photo taken of you .
Considering that prices range from $ 20 to $ 30 for each picture , you can certainly save a lot of money by bringing your own camera and asking fellow passengers to snap photos for you .
On the other hand , professional portraits do make nice souvenirs , especially when you ’re all gussied up for the formal night of the cruise .
Art auctions .
Shipboard art auctions can be a lot of fun , and they do offer free champagne and that ’s the problem .
If you ’re not careful with the cheap bubbly , you could end up owning a picture that resembles four dogs playing poker .
I ’ve seen this happen a number of times , and I ’ve seen the remorseful bidder go home hundreds of dollars poorer .
If you see something you really like , take a picture of it and see if a local art gallery can find it or something like it for you .
You usually get better art deals on land , where you can play the competition among art galleries .
Bar bill .
Soft drinks , bottled water and alcoholic drinks can really add up .
These refreshments are seldom included in the cruise fare , except on luxury cruises , so you have to think ahead .
Find out if your ship offers a soda package — a deal that offers unlimited sodas for $ 44 , a real boon for people traveling with kids .
Cruise lines prefer that you buy alcoholic drinks directly from them , but you can bring your own wine aboard to be served to you at dinner .
The catch is that you will be charged a corkage fee usually around $ 10 per bottle .
( Do not try to bring bottles of liquor aboard ; the cruise line will confiscate them , though they will return them to you at the end of the cruise ; however , you might get away with a flask . )
One of the easiest ways to save beverage money is to bring a water bottle or coffee mug on board and fill it up in the self - serve buffet .
Instead of plopping down $ 2 for a bottle of water , I fill up a few of my own .
Specialty restaurants .
Many mainstream and premium cruise lines now have onboard alternative restaurants , which offer specialty menus with prices ranging from $ 15 to $ 75 per person .
Sure , the food is interesting , but is it any better than what ’s served in the ship ’s dining room for free ?
It depends on your taste and what the cruise line is offering .
For example , Norwegian Cruise Line offers a variety of excellent alternative dining choices , including an amazing teppanyaki table experience at a reasonable cost of $ 25 .
Internet access .
Most ships have Internet access , but they often charge a fee .
Some cruise lines like Viking River and Viking Ocean offer unlimited internet access whereas most offer package deals for a set fee .
You can save a lot of money by visiting an Internet facility in port .
Ask a crew member where to find an Internet cafe on shore , or check out the local public library , where you can sometimes check your e-mail for free .
Gambling .
Shipboard casinos are getting bigger and bigger , which means that more and more money is being lost at sea .
If you decide to roll the dice , set a limit on how much you are willing to risk , then leave as soon as you lose it .
Spa services .
While pampering should be part of every cruise vacation , frequenting the ship ’s spa can be costly .
A massage can range anywhere from $ 80 to $ 180 per hour not to mention the 18 percent tip .
You can save money on spa treatments by looking for discounted spa specials , which are usually offered when the ship is in port .
Keep in mind that the spa staff works on commission ; this means you will often get a sales pitch for their products after your treatments .
Unless you really like the products , do n’t feel obliged to purchase them .
Many shipboard spas feature products by Steiner Leisure .
If you like them , check out the prices on TimeToSpa.com ; you can often get a better deal there than on the ship .
Shore excursions .
Shore excursions can be pricey , especially on such destination - intensive itineraries as Alaska , Europe and Hawaii .
In most cases , it ’s easy to arrange your own excursions and save money .
Visit the port ’s official tourism
Web site for up - to - date information on tour operators and pricing .
You can find a comprehensive list of worldwide tourism sites at JohnnyJet.com .
Companies that specialize in planning tours for cruise passengers include Viator and Shore Trips .
Both allow you to book your shore excursions before you leave home , and the savings can be significant .
If you are going to Alaska , try to get your hands on Alaska TourSaver .
You can order the book or download the App , both offer coupons for free admissions , two - for - one tours , flight - seeing , whale watching , free car rentals , second night free hotels and much more .
Despite the cost , there is one very good reason to purchase your shore excursions through the cruise line :
If your excursion runs late , the ship will not leave port without you .
Anytime you schedule an independent trip , you lose that safety net , so be sure to leave enough time to get back to the ship before departure because , believe me , the ship will leave without you .
Laundry .
Laundry and dry cleaning charges on a cruise can be exorbitant .
For example , a T - shirt can cost $ 4 to wash and a pair of underwear $ 2 .
Check to see if there is a self - service launderette .
That will be much cheaper typically $ 3 to $ 5 per load .
If you do n’t feel like doing your own laundry and need some clean clothes , do n’t despair .
Most cruise lines set aside one day on each voyage when they will wash a bag of laundry for a set fee , usually $ 15 to $ 25 per bag ( the cruise line provides the bag ) .
Film and sundries .
Buy plenty of film and other camera supplies at home , because once on board , the price doubles .
The same can be said for pain relievers , sunscreen and many other small , personal - use items .
Do n’t get me wrong , I am not advocating spending nothing aboard ship , just that you stay the course within your allotted budget .
If you do n’t , your next hard - earned cruise vacation could be at risk .

Too many times people simply try and sell ‘ steak ’ to their prospects and customers instead of selling them the ‘ sizzle ’ .
The ‘ sizzling of the steak ’ starts the sale more than the cow ever will , even though the cow is obviously very important .
Imagine for a second , you are at a BBQ and a big fat juicy steak gets thrown onto the hot plate .
You can smell the aroma in the air and hear the sizzle of the steak as it begins to cook .
At this point , you probably have n’t given a second though about the cow and you probably NEVER will .
Which is exactly my point .
The ‘ sizzle ’ is simply the BIGGEST selling point in your product or service and it ’s the main reason why your prospects want to buy from you .
You will find hidden in everything you sell , whether it ’s online , face to face , via direct mail , in the newspapers – in any selling situation . . . whether tangible or intangible . . . the ‘ SIZZLES ’ for your business .
Once you find them and start to use to get the sales process rolling , you can them spend time on the features and any technical information .
When you go to a restaurant , the waiter knows he must sell you the bubbles and not the champagne .
The coffee companies sell you on aroma and not the actual coffee .
Only your butcher sells the cow and not the sizzle , however even he knows the promise of the sizzle generates more sales of his better cuts of quality meat .
Even the vacuum cleaner salesperson knows to sell health , comfort , labor - saving , leisure and cleaner homes ( The ‘ sizzles ’ ) and that the construction and mechanisms etc of the vacuum cleaner are the ‘ COW ’.
Are you beginning to see why it is so important to find your ‘ sizzles ’ first in every thing you sell . . . before you can even think about crafting the right words which sell the ‘ sizzles ’ to your prospects and customers ?
I urge you to grab a notepad and a pen , put on your ‘ sizzle glasses ’ and look at you own sales package , products and offers so that you can dig up the ‘ sizzles ’ .
Write them all down .
You may find one , five , ten , even twenty sizzles and once you have done this , put them in the order of importance .
Happy sizzle hunting !
Warmly
Trevor ‘ Toe Cracker ’ Crook

Everywhere I look , programmers and programming tools seem to have standardized on XML .
Configuration files , build scripts , local data storage , code comments , project files , you name it -- if it 's stored in a text file and needs to be retrieved and parsed , it 's probably XML .
I realize that we have to use something to represent reasonably human readable data stored in a text file , but XML sometimes feels an awful lot like using an enormous sledgehammer to drive common household nails .
I 'm deeply ambivalent about XML .
I 'm reminded of this Winston Churchill quote :
It has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all the others that have been tried .
XML is like democracy .
Sometimes it even works .
On the other hand , it also means we end up with stuff like this :
< SOAP -ENV : Envelope xmlns : SOAP-ENV= " http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/ "
SOAP-ENV:encodingStyle= " http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/ " >
< SOAP-ENV :Body > <m:GetLastTradePrice xmlns:m=" Some - URI " > < symbol > DIS </symbol > </m:GetLastTradePrice >
</ SOAP-ENV:Body > </ SOAP-ENV : Envelope >
How much actual information is communicated here ?
Precious little , and it's buried in an astounding amount of noise .
I do n't mean to pick on SOAP .
This blanket criticism applies to XML , in whatever form it appears .
I spend a disproportionate amount of my time wading through an endless sea of angle brackets and verbose tags desperately searching for the vaguest hint of actual information .
It feels wrong .
You could argue , like Derek Denny - Brown , that XML has been misappropriated and misapplied .
I find it so interesting that XML has become so popular for such things as SOAP .
XML was not designed with the SOAP scenarios in mind .
Other examples of popular scenarios which deviate XML 's original goals are configuration files , quick - n- dirty databases , and [ RSS ] .
I 'll call these ' data ' scenarios , as opposed to the ' document ' scenarios for which XML was originally intended .
In fact , I think it is safe to say that there is more usage of XML for ' data ' scenarios than for ' document ' scenarios , today .
Given its prevalence , you might decide that XML is technologically terrible , but you have to use it anyway .
It sure feels like , for any given representation of data in XML , there was a better , simpler choice out there somewhere .
But it was n't pursued , because , well , XML can represent anything .
Right ?
Consider the following XML fragment :
< memo date = " 2008-02 - 14 " > < from > < name > The Whole World </ name >< email>us@world.org </email > </ from > < to > < name > Dawg</name >< email>dawg158@aol.com </email > </to > < message >
Dear sir , you won the internet .
http://is.gd/fh0 </message > </ memo >
Because XML purports to represent everything , it ends up representing nothing particularly well .
Would n't this information be easier to read and understand -- and only nominally harder to parse -- when expressed in its native format ?

You might argue that XML was never intended to be human readable , that XML should be automagically generated via friendly tools behind the scenes , never exposed to a single living human eye .
It 's a spectacularly grand vision .
I hope one day our great - grandchildren can live in a world like that .
Until that glorious day arrives , I 'd sure enjoy reading text files that do n't make me suffer through the XML angle bracket tax .
So what , then , are the alternatives to XML ?
One popular choice is YAML .
I could explain it , but it 's easier to show you .
Which , I think , is entirely the point .

There 's also JSON notation , which some call the new , fat - free alternative to XML , though this is still hotly debated .
You could do worse than XML .
It 's a reasonable choice , and if you 're going to use XML , then at least learn to use it correctly .
But consider :
Should XML be the default choice ?
Is XML the simplest possible thing that can work for your intended use ?
Do you know what the XML alternatives are ?
Would n't it be nice to have easily readable , understandable data and configuration files , without all those sharp , pointy angle brackets jabbing you directly in your ever - lovin ' eyeballs ?
I do n't necessarily think XML sucks , but the mindless , blanket application of XML as a dessert topping and a floor wax certainly does .
Like all tools , it 's a question of how you use it .
Please think twice before subjecting yourself , your fellow programmers , and your users to the XML angle bracket tax .

In 1997 Cornell University mathematician Daina Taimina finally worked out how to make a physical model of hyperbolic space that allows us to feel , and to tactilely explore , the properties of this unique geometry .
The method she used was crochet .
Dr Taimina ’s inspiration was based on a suggestion that had been put forward in the 1970 ’s by the geometer William Thurston ( also now at Cornell ) .
Noting that one of the qualities of hyperbolic space is that as you move away from a point the space around it expands exponentially , Thurston designed a paper model made up of thin cresent - shaped annuli taped together .
But Thurston ’s model is difficult to make , hard to handle , and inherently fragile .
Taimina intuited that the essence of this construction could be implemented with knitting or crochet simply by increasing the number of stitches in each row .
As you increase , the surface naturally begins to ruffle and crenellate .
Taimina , who grew up in Latvia with a childhood steeped in feminine handicrafts , immediately set about making a model .
At first she tried knitting - and you can indeed knit hyperbolic surfaces - but the large number of stitches on the needles quickly becomes unmanageable and Taimina realized that crochet offered the better approach .
The beauty of Taimina ’s method is that many of the intrinsic properties of hyperbolic space now become visible to the eye and can be directly experienced by playing with the models .
Geodesics – or straight lines – on the hyperbolic surface can be sewn onto the crochet texture for easy examination .
Through the yellow lines in the model below look curved , folding along them demonstrably produces a clean straight line .
Likewise one can see immediately how the parallel postulate is violated .
In the model below there are three straight lines that pass through a point external to a given line ( the one at the bottom ) .
All three of the upper lines never intersect the original line .
With this physical model in your hands you can fold along each line and verify the untruth of Euclid ’s fifth axiom yourself .
The power of Taimina ’s models resides in bringing abstract mathematics into the realm of tactile experience .
Another aspect of hyperbolic space that can be experienced with Taimina ’s models is the properties of triangles .
In school we learn that the angles of a triangle always sum to 180Ú .
That is true on a Euclidean plane , but it is not true on a sphere or on a hyperbolic plane .
On a sphere , the interior angles of a triangle always sum to more than 180Ú ( a fact the reader may verify for themselves by drawing on a beach ball or balloon ) .
On a hyperbolic surface the angles of a triangle add to less than 180Ú .
Moreover , the larger triangle the smaller the angles will be .
Until finally when the triangle points are infinitely far apart - making the largest triangle possible - the angles will sum to zero degrees !
This Ideal Triangle and its angular oddity can be seen on the model below :
Taimina ’s crochet models also enable us to make more exotic hyperbolic constructions .
Just as we can take a piece of ordinary paper and wrap it into a cone , so we can make a hyperbolic cone from a piece of hyperbolic paper .
The resulting form is known as a pseudosphere .
Crochet model of pseudosphere – the hyperbolic equivalent of a cone .
As the rate of increase of the stitches increases , the construction becomes increasingly crenellated .
In effect the space around any point expands ever more exponentially .
Whereas all spheres have the same form - varying only in size - hyperbolic surfaces may differ dramatically from an external point of view .
Mathematically speaking , we characterize this quality by the radius of the hyperbolic plane : the more crenellated the surface appears , the smaller its radius ; the flatter the surface , the greater its radius .
A regular Euclidean plane can be understood as a hyperbolic plane of infinite radius .
The radius of any given hyperbolic plane is the radius of a circle that would sit flatly on an a tabletop .
The Dean 25 are in a position to hold the balance of power on a procedural matter that could play a pivotal role in deciding the Democratic presidential nomination .
The Dean 25 could decide Clinton 's fate
If , as Hillary Rodham Clinton has suggested , her campaign takes the fight to seat the Florida and Michigan delegations all the way to the Democratic National Convention this summer , the fate of her challenge is all but certain to hinge on 25 individuals appointed to the Credentials Committee by party Chairman Howard Dean .
The Credentials Committee , which also includes 161 members selected from the states based on primary and caucus results , is the 186 - member body that will help determine whether to seat the two rogue delegations .

Since it appears virtually impossible for Clinton to win enough of the 161 members to vote out a “ majority report ” supporting her position — and it is unlikely that Barack Obama will win enough of them , either — the Dean 25 are in a position to hold the balance of power on a procedural matter that could play a pivotal role in deciding the Democratic presidential nomination .
Though these 25 appointees are often assumed to be handpicked Dean loyalists who will take their cues from him on the issue of seating Florida and Michigan , a Politico analysis has found that is far from certain .
Many of the 25 are already publicly supporting either Clinton or Obama — and some are barely acquainted with Dean .
" It was important to Gov. Dean that the standing committees be diverse and be representative of the Democratic Party as a whole , ” said Democratic National Committee press secretary Stacie Paxton .
“ He personally asked each nominee if they were prepared to do what ’s in the best interest of the country and the Democratic Party before he made the appointment . ”
What follows is Politico ’s guide to the Dean 25 , based on interviews with appointees and additional reporting .

A TROWBRIDGE Christian who renounced the evil of Dr Who in favour of his religion is selling his collection on internet auction website eBay .
Simon
White , 47 , became obsessed with Dr Who from a very early age and started collecting and building life - size models .
He shares his home in Boundary Walk with a full - size Tardis that he built himself , a huge Dalek , two Cybermen and model of Dr Who 's robotic dog K - 9 .
The collection , which Mr White estimates is worth nearly £ 7,000 , was built up over a number of years but is to be cast aside because of his religious beliefs .
Dr Who and his materialistic obsession with it represents the " greatest lie that Satan ever told " according to Mr White .
He said : " I loved science fiction as a kid .
It was the Tardis that did it for me .
You could get in that box and go anywhere .
" I started collecting Dr Who stuff starting with the Dalek , which I got from an old exhibition in Brighton .
" Me and a friend spent two years making the Tardis and I became obsessed .
I made a model of K - 9 , then a full size Cyberman with authentic Dr Who parts .
I could n't stop .
" I had to retire early from my job as a nurse at the Royal United Hospital in Bath in 1998 because I was suffering from bipolar disorder .
" I turned to drink and became an alcoholic and the Dr Who obsession was the only thing that kept me going .
I would n't have given it up if you 'd have put a gun to my head . "
Having discovered Christianity Mr Smith has renounced his old life and is putting the whole collection up for sale in local trade magazines and on eBay .
He said : " God delivered me from the evil that is Dr Who , materialism and alcoholism .
" Through my relationship with Jesus I saw that none of this was making me happy and I was born again like Lazarus .
" It 's a timely tale as we come up to Easter .
I wanted to tell others that no matter what trouble you are in God can deliver you from the evil .
If you are prepared to have a relationship with him then God can help .
I have been resurrected .
My old life is dead , my new life is alive . "

Advertisement Fans of pop star Rick Astley descended on London 's Liverpool Street train station for a " flashmob " event .
The " flashmob " - where a group of people assemble in a public place for a brief period of time - happened just before 1800 BST .
Some of the fans donned Astley masks in honour of the 1980s hitmaker , before the crowd sang his trademark hit Never Gonna Give You Up. Police said the incident passed peacefully - if not quietly .
' Really funny ' Witness Paras Barot , 22 , from Golders Green in north London , said he heard about the event on social networking site Facebook and decided to head to the station .
" I got there with some friends just before 6 pm , and there were lots of people there - the whole station was at a standstill . "
He said he thought there were some 300 or 400 people taking part in the event .
The crowd descended just before 1800 BST " There was a countdown from 5.59 to 6 pm .
Some guys put their masks on , and a lot of them started singing the song .
" For those of us who knew what was going on it was really funny . "
Mr Barot said he did not join in the singing .
" I do n't know the words . "
A British Transport Police spokeswoman said : " We monitored the incident .
There were no problems , no arrests .
They did what they had to do and then left . "
An estimated 13 million internet users have been tricked into watching the video for Rick Astley 's Never Gonna Give You Up in recent weeks .
Your comments :
As soon as I found out , I knew it was something I could n't miss !
I rushed from Canary Wharf where I work and it was most definitely worth it - 500 people sharing a common goal to entertain the nation - what can be better ?
Rob , London I was one of the flashmobbers .
I was one of the people in masks singing along as loud as we could .
Was a brilliant event , was a laugh .
Shame it did n't last longer , hope we managed to entertain people .
Have to say it was well organised .
Thanks

The study suggests hurricanes could become less frequent Hurricanes and tropical storms will become less frequent by the end of the century as a result of climate change , US researchers have suggested .
But the scientists added their data also showed that there would be a " modest increase " in the intensity of these extreme weather events .
The findings are at odds with some other studies , which forecast a greater number of hurricanes in a warmer world .
The researchers ' results appear in the journal Nature Geoscience .
The team from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's ( Noaa ) Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory ( GFDL ) said its findings did not support the notion that human - induced climate change was causing an increase in the number of hurricanes and tropical storms .
" There have been some studies published that have suggested that this is the case , but this modelling study does not support that idea , " observed lead author Tom Knutson .
" Rather , we actually simulate a reduction in hurricane frequency in the Atlantic . "
Eye of the storm
Although the study projected that there would be fewer extreme weather events in the future , Dr Knutson said that these storms were likely to be more powerful .
" The model is simulating increased intensity of the hurricanes that do occur , and also increased rainfall rates .
" This is something that has been seen in previous studies , and the IPCC use this [ scenario ] as a likely projection for future climate warming .
We do not regard this study as the last word on this topic
Dr Tom Knutson ,
Noaa meteorologist " These changes in intensity are still fairly modest in size . "
A previous study by Noaa scientists showed a 4 % increase in storm intensity for every 1C ( 1.8 F ) increase in sea surface temperature .
Yet , he explained , this study suggested only a 1 - 2 % increase .
A sea surface temperature ( SST ) above 26.5C ( 79.7 F ) is one of the key factors in the formation and feeding of a hurricane .
Over recent decades , the surfaces of most tropical oceans have warmed by up to 0.5C ( 0.9 F ) , which the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) believes has been caused by an increase in greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere .
In November 2006 , the global community of tropical cyclone researchers gathered at a workshop organised by the World Meteorological Organization to consider the impact of human activity on the frequency and intensity of cyclones .
HOW HURRICANES FORM Sea surface temperatures above 26.5C ( 79.7 F )
A pre-existing weather disturbance Moisture in the atmosphere Favourable conditions , such as light winds or weak wind shear
Animated guide : Hurricanes
In a concluding statement , the researchers said that although there was evidence both for and against the existence of a detectable anthropogenic signal in the tropical cyclone climate record , no firm conclusion could be made .
One reason for the uncertainty is the changes in observation methods used to record Atlantic hurricanes - a record that dates back to 1850 .
From 1944 , air reconnaissance flights were used to monitor tropical storms and hurricanes .
This development allowed researchers to monitor a much greater area and not rely on ships ' logs and storms reaching land .
And from the late 1960s , satellite technology has been used to monitor and track hurricanes .
Therefore , a reliable record of past hurricane activity only stretches back about 35 years .
Natural variations that affect SSTs - such as El Nino and La Nina episodes and the Atlantic Multi- decadal Oscillation - add to the difficulty of identifying the influence of human - induced climate change on the frequency and intensity of hurricanes .
Model mechanics
Dr Knutson 's colleague and co-author , Isaac Held , said the team 's model used a different approach to previous efforts , which gave them a high degree of confidence in their results .
The researchers project a " modest increase " in future storms ' intensity " Most of the literature to date on hurricanes and climate change has used statistical techniques , " he said .
" You 've had time series of hurricane activity and time series of sea surface temperatures , and people correlate them . "
Because there was a high degree of confidence that the sea surface temperature trend was going to continue to rise , Dr Held explained , people had " tried to conclude that hurricane activity will increase rather dramatically in the future " .
" We tried to simulate the fundamental fluid dynamics and thermodynamics that control hurricane genesis in the Atlantic in a numerical model to a very high resolution . "
He added that the team ran data from the past 25 years through the model , and it returned results closely correlated to what actually occurred .
" It is interesting and important to understand why it is that this model is capable of simulating an increase in hurricane activity that we have seen in recent decades , yet it predicts a decrease in the future .
" This implies that we cannot simply extrapolate the past 25 years into the future . "
Dr Knutson said that he did not expect the study 's findings to end the scientific debate surrounding the impact of human - induced climate change on tropical storms .
" We do not regard this study as the last word on this topic , " he told reporters .
" The main point that we want to emphasise is that there is no evidence in this study that we are seeing large greenhouse - gas - driven increases in Atlantic hurricane or tropical storm frequencies . "

Joe Lieberman is taking a page out of Dick Cheney 's playbook and carefully connected al - Qaeda to Iran with an answer he gave to Nora O'Donnell on MSNBC moments ago .
Much has been made of McCain 's foreign policy gaffe on his middle east tour when he said that Shia / Iran was training the Sunni / al - Qaeda .
Lieberman had to whisper the correct answer in his ear at that time to correct that fallacy .
However , we can see a clear pattern of deception the Senator from CT is using to try and once again confuse the American public about the nonexistent ties between al - Qaeda and Iran .
Liebermann : ... we can do it on conditions on the ground , but if we just pull out there will be chaos , maybe genocide and al - Qaeda and Iran will win .
Al - Qaeda is a very small percentage of the resistance that is on going in Iraq as we all know .
Why has n't Holy Joe addressed the ethnic cleansing that has already occurred in Iraq between the Sunni and Shia 's militias in Baghdad alone ?
Joe can't do that and admit the horror that he has enabled already .
His only hope is to confuse the public into thinking that al - Qaeda is aligned with Iran .
Have you no decency , sir ?
Interesting video on the Threat to Net Neutrality .
Well done , but I ’m not crazy about bills that legislate something that is n’t well - enough defined or understood .
By which I mean both the Net and Neutrality .
Here ’s S.215 , for example .
( Full text here . )
What ’s meant by “ lawful ” ?
Or “ broadband ” ?
I suspect the language in this bill will be as antique in five years as the languge of the 1934 act is today .
And if this new bill passes , the untintended legacies of both will still be in force .
The framing bothers me too .
It is all inside what Bob Frankston calls The Regulatorium .
I ’d rather see the Net defined and understood outside of that .
This is not to say I do n’t think the Net is threatened .
It is .
I just think its biggest enemy is lack of imagination , not lack of regulation .
And by that I mean lack of imagination by both the carriers and their opponents .
The carriers have trouble imagining being in any businesses other than the “ triple play ” or “ quad play ” they ’re offering now , or to imagine there are any benefits to incumbency other than improvements on the customary forms of coersion .
The pro-neutrality folks have trouble imagining any case to make other than one that involves more lawmaking and regulatory relief .
Both are arguing inside the Regulatorium .
By policy and temperment Libertarians and dynamists like to think and work outside the Regulatoriium .
So I ’m wondering where creative ones might want to go with this thing .
Adam Thierer ’s 2004 Cato Institute policy analysis on Net Neutrality makes some important points , especially about unintended consequences of legislation , but it ’s framed entirely within The Regulatorium , and the belief that the Net is ( in Bob Frankston ’s words ) a “ thing ” we “ consume ” .
And the somewhat Libertarian Wall Street Journal , now more than ever the Church Bulletin of the Republican Party , still sees “ The Market ” ( at least where the Net is concerned ) as “ Your Choice of Lock - In ” .
I ’d rather look at the Net as the best marketplace the world has ever known .
Nothing is more wide open and supportive for business , as well as culture .
Is the best way to grow that marketplace to have it reduced to a crippled “ service ” offered as gravy on top of TV and telephony ?
Or to oppose that with legislation ?
I think the Net will grow best if lots of players enter its marketplace with new value - adds — including the carriers themselves , leveraging advantages to incumency other than their position to charge monopoly rents .
I think there is lots of opportunity for individuals and small businesses to take the lead by connecting to each other any way they can , with or without carrier help .
Think about all the small businesses that could be liberated to do inventive new stuff if the carriers did n’t overcharge “ business ” customers ( a legacy of Ma Bell that has n’t gone away , and needs to ) .
Think about how many generic ( and generative ) servers , services and data storage facilities could be installed in old switching plants and cable head - ends , operated by the carriers themselves or in partnership with the likes of Amazon , Google or Rackspace — taking advantage of both existing real estate and low latency connections to customers .
Think about what will happen when the last mile becomes the first one — when consumers not only become producers , but when electricians , small contractors and homeowners can start deploying their own infrastructure from the edge inward .
For a peek at how that will start to work and look , check out some of the pictures here .
My point is that we need other voices here , other ideas , new arguments .
Fighting threats is good .
Pursuing opportunities is better .
The general election is about to unfold and we ’ll soon see how smart or how foolish Americans really are .
The U.S. may be the richest country on earth , but the economy is tanking , its working families are in trouble , it is bogged down in a multitrillion - dollar war of its own making and the price of gasoline has nitwits siphoning supplies from the cars and trucks of strangers .
Four of every five Americans want the country to move in a different direction , which makes this presidential election , potentially , one of the most pivotal since World War II .
And yet there ’s growing evidence that despite the plethora of important issues , the election may yet be undermined by the usual madness  fear - mongering , bogus arguments over who really loves America , race - baiting , gay - baiting ( Ohmigod !
They ’re getting married ! ) and the wholesale trivialization of matters that are not just important , but extremely complex .
In his book , “ Crunch : Why Do I Feel So Squeezed ? , ” Jared Bernstein reminds us that the economic expansion from 2000 to 2006 was something less than nirvana for working people .
The economy grew by 15 percent during that period , and the official rates of joblessness and inflation were low .
But as most of us know , the benefits of that expansion were skewed to the high end of the economic ladder .

Mr Obama has won the most delegates in the primary contests so far Senator Barack Obama says he is close to securing the Democratic Party 's nomination to run in the US presidential election in November .
Mr Obama looks set to win a majority of " pledged " delegates , allocated in primary elections , although he is still short of a confirmed overall victory .
With most of the votes counted , he is well ahead in Tuesday 's Oregon primary .
But rival Senator Hillary Clinton won Kentucky 's primary by a large margin and has vowed to fight on .
' Popular vote ' Mr Obama addressed his supporters in Iowa , scene of this year 's first presidential selection contest .
" We have returned to Iowa with a majority of delegates elected by the American people , " he told his supporters .
DEMOCRATIC DELEGATES
Pledged delegates : 3,253 Super - delegates : 797 Total delegates needed for nomination : 2,026 Delegates for Barack Obama : 1,961 ( 1,654 pledged , 307 super - delegates ) Delegates for Hillary Clinton : 1,779 ( 1,500 pledged , 279 super - delegates ) Source : Associated Press , as of 1551 BST on 21 May

Two key primaries US media look to battle 's end " You have put us within reach of the Democratic nomination for president of the United States , " he said .
The party 's presidential candidate will be chosen by party delegates at the Democratic National Convention in August .
With all the votes counted in Kentucky and most of the votes counted in Oregon , Mr Obama has won 1,649 pledged delegates , surpassing the 1,627 needed to claim a majority .
Mrs Clinton has won 1,497 pledged delegates .
Correspondents say Mr Obama will be hoping that his majority will persuade the remaining undecided " super - delegates " - senior party members who get a vote at the convention - to rally behind him .
Hailing her Kentucky victory , Mrs Clinton said she would fight " until we have a nominee - whoever she may be " .
In a passage seemingly directed at the remaining undecided super - delegates , Mrs Clinton said she would be " best positioned to win in November " against the presumptive Republican candidate , Senator John McCain .

Mrs Clinton also said she was winning " the popular vote " over Mr Obama , although that claim has been disputed by the Obama camp .
BBC North America editor Justin Webb says Mr Obama wants to suggest without quite saying so that the primary season is closing and that the general election race is beginning .
But Mrs Clinton has warned Mr Obama against declaring premature victory , saying it would be a " slap in the face " to her millions of supporters so far and those states yet to vote .
The remaining primaries are Puerto Rico , on 1 June , followed two days later by South Dakota and Montana .
Racial attitudes
In Kentucky , Mrs Clinton won 65 % of the vote to Mr Obama 's 30 % .
In Oregon , with most of the votes counted , Mr Obama has 58.3 % of the vote to Mrs Clinton 's 41.7 % .
Exit polls conducted by the Associated Press news agency suggested that Mrs Clinton 's Kentucky victory was rooted in her strong support among the state 's many white working - class voters .
Racial attitudes may also have motivated some Kentucky voters ' decisions : of the 20 % of white voters who said that race had played a part in their choice , nine out of 10 backed Mrs Clinton .

Phone surveys of Oregon voters painted a strikingly different picture of that state 's electorate .
Mr Obama won 60 % of the state 's white voters , while just 10 % of the state 's voters said that race was important when deciding their vote , and they were split evenly between Mr Obama and Mrs Clinton .
As the results were coming in , Mr Obama , Mrs Clinton and Mr McCain revealed details of how much money they had raised in April .
Mr Obama raised $ 31 m ( £ 15.5 m ) , less than in March but still the highest of the three presidential hopefuls .
Mrs Clinton 's campaign took in $ 22 m ( £ 11.5 m ) , its second best fundraising month so far , while Mr McCain managed to raise $ 18 m ( £ 9 m ) , his best monthly total .

ORLANDO , Florida ( Reuters ) - Google Inc has unveiled a plan to help U.S. patients gain control of their medical records and is working with doctors ’ groups , pharmacies and labs to help them securely share sensitive health data .
A Google search page is seen through the spectacles of a computer user in Leicester , central England July 20 , 2007 .
Web search company Google Inc is testing in the United States an online storage bank where individuals can store and access their medical records , the company said on Thursday .
REUTERS / Darren Staples
The company ’s long - rumored entry into the highly sensitive field came when Chief Executive Eric Schmidt introduced Google Health at a health - care conference in Florida on Thursday .
Google said it has signed deals with hospitals and companies including medical tester Quest Diagnostics Inc , health insurer Aetna Inc , Walgreens and Walmart Stores Inc pharmacies .
The password - protected Web service stores health records on Google computers , with a medical services directory that lets users import doctors ’ records , drug history and test results .
Google aims to foster sharing of information between these services , but keep control in patients ’ hands , allowing them to schedule appointments or refill prescriptions , for example .
“ We do n’t know how to suck it out of the brains of doctors , but we know how to suck it out of the computer systems of doctors , ” Schmidt said in an interview after his speech .
A week ago , Google said it was teaming up with leading academic medical researcher Cleveland Clinic to test a data exchange that puts patients in charge of records .
Schmidt said it would likely be a few months before Google Health is offered more widely .
For decades progress has been slow converting paper records often scrawled in illegible doctors ’ script and stored in conflicting filing systems into centrally held digital records .
IBM , Oracle Corp and Siemens AG , among many others , have worked on such digitization .
Google ’s biggest rival , Microsoft Corp , has introduced HealthVault , which gives users control over who sees what .
Among start - ups active in the field are Revolution Health , a company backed by former AOL Chairman Steve Case .
All are based on the notion that individuals should retain control over the data .
“ The information in your health record is yours and it does n’t get shared with anyone else without your permission , ” Schmidt said .
Electronic record - keeping has been held back by a lack of focus on consumer needs , not privacy fears , he said , adding any system should “ ‘ normal - person ’ designed , not doctor designed . ”
PRIVACY DEBATE
While medical providers are covered by U.S. privacy laws , there is little in the way of established privacy , security and data usage standards for electronic personal health records .
Google is prepared to resist fishing expeditions by lawyers seeking to subpoena personal medical records stored on Google Health .
Last year , it went to court to defeat an effort by the U.S. Justice Department to request some Google search records .
“ We ’ve taken a pretty aggressive position in a pro-consumer way in the U.S. , but I do want to assure you we are subject to U.S. law , ” Schmidt said .
Google earns almost all its revenue in Web advertising , but has no plan to sell ads on Google Health .
It aims to make money indirectly when users search for other medical information .
Google sees solving privacy issues around health as part of its none - too - humble corporate mission to “ organize the world ’s information and make it universally accessible and useful . ”
In tackling medical privacy , Google also stands to benefit in finance and other areas where sensitive data is stored .
Some privacy advocates were quick to criticize the effort .
Howard Simon , executive director of the Florida American Civil Liberties Union , said storing medical records with consumer Web services raises data breach risks .
“ A breach of security would be catastrophic , ” Simon said .
“ It ’s very , very troublesome . ”
But Andrew Rocklin , a principal in the health care practice of Diamond Management & Technology Consultants , whose clients include big U.S. health insurers , said giving patients more control over records promises many benefits , while raising some new issues .
Perceived risks of online health records will remain high until consumers become more familiar with the benefits .
When tied to exercise , dieting or other wellness programs , such records can give consumers extraordinary insights , he noted .
“ People need to be good stewards of their health in general and their health data , which is an aspect of that , ” he said .
The landing site chosen for NASA´s Mars Phoenix Lander is much farther north than the sites where previous spacecraft have landed on Mars .
Image credit : NASA / JPL - Caltech
NASA 's Phoenix Mars Lander is preparing to end its long journey and begin a three - month mission to taste and sniff fistfuls of Martian soil and buried ice .
The lander is scheduled to touch down on the Red Planet May 25 .
Phoenix will enter the top of the Martian atmosphere at almost 21,000 kilometers per hour ( almost 13,000 mph ) .
In seven minutes , the spacecraft must complete a challenging sequence of events to slow to about 8 kilometers per hour ( 5 mph ) before its three legs reach the ground .
Confirmation of the landing could come as early as 4:53 p.m. PDT ( 7:53 p.m. EDT ) .
" This is not a trip to grandma 's house .
Putting a spacecraft safely on Mars is hard and risky , " said Ed Weiler , associate administrator for NASA 's Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington .
" Internationally , fewer than half the attempts have succeeded . "
Rocks large enough to spoil the landing or prevent opening of the solar panels present the biggest known risk .
However , images from the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment ( HiRISE ) camera on NASA 's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter , detailed enough to show individual rocks smaller than the lander , have helped lessen that risk .
" We have blanketed nearly the entire landing area with HiRISE images , " said Ray Arvidson of Washington University in St. Louis , chairman of the Phoenix landing - site working group .
" This is one of the least rocky areas on all of Mars and we are confident that rocks will not detrimentally impact the ability of Phoenix to land safely . "
Phoenix uses hardware from a spacecraft built for a 2001 launch that was canceled in response to the loss of a similar Mars spacecraft during a 1999 landing attempt .
Researchers who proposed the Phoenix mission in 2002 saw the unused spacecraft as a resource for pursuing a new science opportunity .
Earlier in 2002 , NASA 's Mars Odyssey orbiter discovered that plentiful water ice lies just beneath the surface throughout much of high - latitude Mars .
NASA chose the Phoenix proposal over 24 other proposals to become the first endeavor in the Mars Scout program of competitively selected missions .
" Phoenix will land farther north on Mars than any previous mission , " said Phoenix Project Manager Barry Goldstein of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif .
" The Phoenix mission not only studies the northern permafrost region , but takes the next step in Mars exploration by determining whether this region , which may encompass as much as 25 percent of the Martian surface , is habitable , " said Peter Smith , Phoenix principal investigator at the University of Arizona , Tucson .
The solar - powered robotic lander will manipulate a 2.35 meter arm ( 7.7 foot ) to scoop up samples of underground ice and soil lying above the ice .
Onboard laboratory instruments will analyze the samples .
Cameras and a Canadian - supplied weather station will supply other information about the site 's environment .
One research goal is to assess whether conditions at the site ever have been favorable for microbial life .
The composition and texture of soil above the ice could give clues to whether the ice ever melts in response to long - term climate cycles .
Another important question is whether the scooped - up samples contain carbon - based chemicals that are potential building blocks and food for life .

SOARING fuel prices are carving into the budgets of car - dependent households in western Sydney , exacerbating problems of insufficient public transport options and long distances to workplaces .
Families in the west are driving up to 20 times the distance of those in the eastern suburbs , inner west and Lower North Shore , according to research by a PhD student at the University of Technology , Sydney , Peter Rickwood .
With fuel prices at about $ 1.50 a litre , households in the city 's outer western ring - many of which are struggling with mortgage repayments - are sacrificing more than 6 per cent of their gross household income on petrol , Mr Rickwood 's research shows .
Households in the inner city are using less than 2 per cent of their incomes on fuel .
With fuel prices continuing to climb , the dire situation is likely to spread further east .
If it reaches $ 2 a litre , as some predict could happen within the next two years , households near Parramatta and Bankstown could be using more than 6 per cent of their income on fuel .
" This should send very significant alarm bells through government , " said the president of the NRMA , Alan Evans .
" Because there is no end in sight for seeing a downturn in the price of petrol and therefore the research would show that we have a serious crisis developing for the mortgage - belt families . "
His concern was echoed by the president of the Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils , Tony Hay .
" This is further substantial proof of the inequitable divide which reinforces the tale of two cities .
Those of us [ who are ] car dependent are taking a huge burden for consumption of petroleum and the component of fuel excise , " he said .
As rising fuel prices began to put the squeeze on family budgets , everything from doing volunteer work to driving to children 's weekend sporting events could be affected , he said .
" All the activities that make us a community , not just an economy , have the potential to be severely impacted . "
Mr Rickwood 's research combines data from the Department of Transport 's annual survey of 3000 Sydney residents with demographic information from the census .
He said the actual effect of fuel prices on households could be much greater in some cases than the averages shown in his research , especially if cars consumed more than nine litres of petrol per 100 kilometres .
Mr Evans said it was deeply concerning that there was no short - term remedy in sight .
" The neglect of public transport over the years is now highlighting the problem .
Clearly it shows the failure to build a public transport network is now coming back to bite people . "
He urged the federal and state governments to expand public transport into the western suburbs and urgently fund research into alternative fuels .
The Sydney co-ordinator of the Australian Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas , David Bell , said it was likely fuel would climb to $ 1.60 a litre in the coming months .
" Within two years time I would say we would be getting close to $ 2 [ a litre ] .
Since we 've begun peaking , no one has any current history as to where petrol prices may go in the future . "

In the end it came down to a single - page letter , written in Hebrew and Arabic and hand - delivered by an Israeli army officer who knocked at the front door .
The letter spelt the imminent destruction of the whitewashed three - storey home and small , tree - lined garden that Bassam Suleiman spent so long saving for and then built with his family a decade ago .
It was a final demolition order , with instructions to evacuate the house within three days .
If Suleiman was in any doubt about the Israeli military 's intentions he had only to look outside his back door where large piles of rubble and broken concrete mark the remains of the seven of his neighbours ' houses that were demolished in the same way last year .
" How would you feel when you 've spent 20 years finishing your life 's project ? " said Suleiman , 38 , a teacher .
He began moving his furniture out after the letter , from the civil administration of Judea and Samaria , the defence ministry department responsible for the Israeli - occupied West Bank , came on January 31 .
Now there are just a couple of plastic chairs in his front room and in the hallway the carpets are rolled up and ready to be moved .
Clothes are piled on the floor and the shelves are empty , save for a stack of documents charting the story of the impending demolition .
His brother , Husam , has already left the ground floor flat but the new washing machine and fridge stand still wrapped in plastic .
Suleiman , his wife and two children wait for the bulldozers .
" Everything I did in my life was for what 's now inside this house and now it 's going to be destroyed , " said Suleiman .
" It 's very hard for me to find somewhere else to live . "
The Israeli authorities argue that Suleiman 's house was built in a part of the West Bank known as area C , a designation from the era of the Oslo Accords which means Israel has full military and administrative control .
In order to build , a Palestinian must apply for a permit from the Israeli authorities .
If there is no permit - as in Suleiman 's case - the building is liable for demolition .
Illegal
Area C covers 60 % of the West Bank , home to around 70,000 Palestinians .
It is also the area in which most Jewish settlements , all illegal under international law , are built .
Compelling statistical evidence shows that while it is extremely hard for Palestinians to obtain building permits , settlements continue to grow rapidly .
Research by the Israeli group Peace Now found that 94 % of Palestinian permit applications for Area C building were refused between 2000 and September 2007 .
Only 91 permits were granted to Palestinians , but 18,472 housing units were built in Jewish settlements .
As a result of demolition orders 1,663 Palestinian buildings were demolished , against only 199 in the settlements .
" The denial of permits for Palestinians on such a large scale raises the fear that there is a specific policy by the authorities to encourage a ' silent transfer ' of the Palestinian population from area C , " Peace Now said .
This year there has been a marked increase in demolitions .
There were 138 demolitions between January and March , most in area C , compared with 29 in the last three months of 2007 , according to the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs .
This year 400 Palestinians have been displaced as a result .
At a time of a renewed peace process to create an independent Palestinian state , the reality in the West Bank is that Jewish settlements are growing and demolitions of Palestinian homes are on the increase .
The problems of the village of Far'un , south of Tulkarm , are complicated by the vast West Bank barrier , which here runs away from the 1949 ceasefire line that divides Israel and the Palestinian territories .
The wide , steel fence , which passes just a few dozen metres from Suleiman 's home , cuts off the village from a slice of its agricultural land and underground water reserves and has turned this area into a dangerous no - go zone : in December 2006 , a 14 - year - old Palestinian girl playing nearby was shot dead by an Israeli soldier .
Suleiman 's house and that of his neighbour Emad Hassahsi , which has also received a demolition order , were built before the barrier arrived , in an area they were told - and they have letters that appear to support their claim - was area B , in which Palestinians have administrative control and therefore somewhere they thought they could safely build .
Only later did the Israeli military announce it was in fact area C .
There are similar disputes about the exact delineation of the different areas elsewhere the West Bank .
Israel 's civil administration offered no explanation for the rise in demolitions but told the Guardian : " The procedures that are carried out before the materialisation of a demolition order include : issuance of an order to cease building that is usually issued in the early stages of the construction of foundations ; numerous deliberations at the high planning and zoning committee and of course an open door to the supreme court of justice .
These procedures are valid for both Palestinians and Israelis alike . "
It said the buildings demolished in Far'un were " built illegally without the required licences " .
One effect of the strict planning curbs is to limit the growth of Palestinian villages .
" If you look at the way the Israelis are enforcing planning and construction regulations you see they are being enforced in a one - sided way , " said Avi Berg , research director of the leading Israeli human rights group B'Tselem , which has worked on the Far'un case .
Settlement growth continues apace despite the fact that the current peace talks are based on the US Road Map , under which Israel is required to freeze settlement activity .
In another report , Peace Now said that since the talks began at Annapolis last November , Israel was still building 500 homes in West Bank settlements and had issued tenders for 750 homes in East Jerusalem settlements .
Reports suggest another 1,400 homes will be built in two settlements in East Jerusalem and in the West Bank .
The Israeli government defends the continued settlement construction particularly in the major settlements which it calls " population centres " , saying it will not build new settlements or expropriate more land .
" In the population centres and in Jerusalem the reality on the ground will not be the same in the future as it is today , " Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert said last month .
" There will be more additional building as part of the reality of life and this is something that was explained ... "
Not all the cases of demolition involve homes .
In January , Israeli forces uprooted 3,200 trees , destroyed water cisterns and stone terraces in fields near Beit Ula , close to Hebron , in the southern West Bank .
Again this was in area C .
The civil administration said the demolition was an " enforcement activity " carried out after legal warnings .
But in this case the target was a € 64,000 ( £ 51,000 ) project from the European commission which began two years ago to provide a livelihood for the villagers , several of whom also put their own money into the planting .
" It was a tragedy for us , " said Sami al - Adam , 46 , a farmer who had put in 45,000 shekels .
" They 're tearing me out by my roots .
They want to destroy Palestinian farmers psychologically and economically . "
Anti-psychotic drugs commonly given to Alzheimer 's patients often make their condition worse , a UK study suggests .
Neuroleptics provided no benefit for patients with mild behavioural problems , but were associated with a marked deterioration in verbal skills .
The research focused on 165 people with advanced Alzheimer 's who were living in nursing homes in four British cities .
Up to 60 % of Alzheimer 's patients in nursing homes are given the drugs to control behaviour such as aggression .
The study appears in the journal Public Library of Science Medicine .
CASE STUDY Rita Clark 's husband was diagnosed with Alzheimer 's seven years ago .
Rita , from Cleveland , said : " My husband developed a range of side effects while receiving anti-psychotic drugs .
" Since the drugs have been withdrawn , the side effects have gone and he generally seems much better and more settled .
" I 'm not saying it 's the same for everyone , but in my husband 's case , withdrawing the drugs has led to a clear improvement in his quality of life . "
The researchers , from Kings College London and the Universities of Oxford and Newcastle , found the drugs offered no long - term benefit for most patients with mild symptoms of disturbed behaviour .
But just six months of treatment was enough for patients to show a marked deterioration in their verbal fluency .
Further preliminary analysis already under way on the data suggests the use of neuroleptics may also increase death rates .
The research focused on patients living in nursing homes in Oxfordshire , Newcastle , Edinburgh and London .
All patients had been taking neuroleptics for three months .
They either continued on the same medication for a further 12 months , or took a dummy pill .
Lead researcher Professor Clive Ballard , said : " It is very clear that even over a six - month period of treatment , there is no benefit from neuroleptics in treating the behaviour in people with Alzheimer 's disease when the symptoms are mild .
" For people with more severe behavioural symptoms , balancing the potential benefits against adverse effects is more difficult . "
Rebecca Wood , of the Alzheimer 's Research Trust , said : " These results are deeply troubling and highlight the urgent need to develop better treatments . "
The trust says that neuroleptics should only continue to be prescribed long - term to dementia patients with severe behavioural problems , and then only as a last resort when non -drug methods have been tried and have failed .
Stroke risk Neil Hunt , of the Alzheimer 's Society , said previous research had also shown that anti-psychotic drugs raised the risk of stroke and death for people with dementia .
" This widespread overprescription to people with dementia must stop , " he said .
" It is time we stop wasting money giving people drug treatments with no benefit and start investing in good quality dementia care . "
It is estimated that 700,000 people are affected by dementia in the UK , a figure that will double in the next 30 years .
A report into the use of anti-psychotics in care homes is due to be published by the All - Party Parliamentary Group on Dementia this month .
Jeremy Wright , group chairman , said : " ' We urgently need to ensure people with dementia are only prescribed drugs as a last resort , not as an easy option .
" We will set out simple changes that must be made to stop this abuse when we publish our findings at the end of April . "
The neuroleptics which came under analysis in the study were thioridazine ( Melleril ) , chlorpromazine ( Largactil ) , haloperidol ( Serenace ) , trifluoperazine ( Stelazine ) and risperidone ( Risperdal ) .

What are these ?
I hate being late to work .
I may have up to four parties in one day but to the clients it ’s their ONLY party of the day .
I ’ve made it a habit to treat every party I work as if it ’s the only one I have that day .
Some do n’t appreciate my thoughtfulness and still feel the need to bitch .
On this particular day I was running fifteen minutes late .
At least I was n’t a Purple Dino .
I was dressed as my clown character , “ Sleepi , ” so it was nice that I could arrive , park , get to work , and not have to worry about changing and being even later than I already was .
Did I mention that I hate being late ?
I parked at the first space I found ; oddly , it was closer to the house than one would think considering that there was a party going on .
“ Maybe a lot of the guests are late and the client wo n’t mind , or even notice , that I ’m late ?
Excellent ! ”
As I got closer to the house I could see a bunch of kids behind a chain link fence playing and running around in the front yard .
They all looked to be older kids , from seven to thirteen - years - old .
“ Strange , ” I thought to myself , “ The party is for a two - year - old girl named Kim , and from what I could tell she was the only one in her age range . ”
As I got closer , one of the older kids saw me approaching and pointed me out to the birthday girl .
“ Look Kimmy !
It ’s a clown ! ”
She was petrified .
Kimmy hid behind one of the older kids , not even peering around him to gawk at me curiously .
I prepared myself mentally for what looked to be the beginnings of a very looooooooong two - hour gig .
What kind of kid does n’t like clown ?
I opened the gate and let myself in .
I started to open my mouth to introduce myself but was stopped by a car racing down the street honking its horn .
It drove slightly over the curb and stopped right next to house .
Inside the lime green convertible Cadillac were three men covered in tattoos and wearing the same brand of dark sunglasses .
If I had to guess , I would say they were around twenty - years - old .
“ Hey clown !
Come over here . ”
The guy in the back seat yelled over to me as if I were way down the street and not just five feet to the side of him .
To emphasize his need to speak to me he motioned to me with his hand to come over .
I thought maybe they wanted directions so I went over to the fence to explain to them that I was n’t from around here .
“ No man , come here . ”
The guy in the passenger seat said and pointed down next to the passenger side door .
Is n’t this how some bad news stories start ?
“ Clown abducted .
News at eleven . ”
I went over to the car anyway .
What can I say ?
I like to live life on the edge .
Like my cousin James always says , “ If you ’re not living life dangerously , you ’re not living . ”
“ Hey clown dude .
I ’m Kimmie ’s fatha ’ .
Where da’ udder clowns at ? ”
“ There are no other clowns .
Just me , ” I informed him .
The guy in the front passenger seat chimed in .
“ How ’s it goin ’ so far ? ”
“ I just got here like a minute ago .
Kimmie ’s afraid of me . ”
“ Meet us up round da ’ corner , ” Kim ’s dad said .
Once again , is n’t this how some bad news stories start ?
“ Clown abducted .
The stupid bastard went around the corner .
News at eleven . ”
So I followed them around the corner .
I ’m a sucker for anything out of the ordinary .
The dad was out of the car by the time I caught up with them .
The better to grab me I guess .
“ Yo , check dis ’ out .
I told da ’ dude on the phone tha’ I wanted three clowns fo ’ two hours . ”
“ I do n’t know about any other clowns .
My sheet shows that it ’s just one clown for two hours .
I do n’t know what to tell you . ”
“ Dat ’s cool .
Tell ya’ wha’ .
You tell ya boss tha’ we all cancelled it and shit . ”
“ If that ’s what you want …I can do the party .
It ’s not a problem . ”
“ No , no , no , check it out .
I ’m gonna give you dis ’ here fiddy bucks .
And yous gonna go back fo’ just fifteen mo ’ minutes . ”
“ Did you already discuss this with the mom ?
Because I have n’t met her yet and no one told me anything . ”
“ I ca n’t do tha’ man .
That bitch ’s got a restraining order on me .
I ca n’t go within one hundred yards of the house .
I ca n’t go to my own baby ’s party .
Is n’t that fucked up ? ”
“ Completely . ” I agreed .
“ We cool clown ? ”
“ Yah , no problem . ”
“ I do n’t think you understand clown .
I SAID … we cool right ? ”
“ We cool . ” I said , as ‘ cool ’ as I could say it while being dressed as a clown and having make up on my face .
“ Thanks man .
Give ma’ baby anythin ’ she want . ”
I walked back to the house and was greeted by one of the children .
“ Where da ’ fuck you bean clown ? ”
Excuse me ?
When I left , these kids seemed happy to see me .
While I was gone they turned into filthy mouthed little monsters .
They must have abandonment issues , or else Kimmy ’s not the only one whose daddy got a restraint order for Christmas .
If you think about it , deep down inside do n’t we all have daddy issues ?
I decided to spend my fifteen minutes making balloon animals .
With every passing second the children exponentially got more and more unpleasant .
It was like the plague .
One kid would get it and pass it on to another .
Before I knew it they were all dropping the “ F ” - bomb on me .
The two boys who started it all were the worst , AND THEY WERE EIGHT AND NINE YEARS OLD !
I ’m glad I was only staying for fifteen minutes .
I thought about leaving earlier but I could see Kimmy ’s dad one hundred and one yards parked down the street .
So that thought went right out of my head .
It ’s a long walk to my car .
Long enough to get shot a few times .
“ Ok , who ’s next ? ”
One of my “ shit starter ” nine - year - old boys spoke up , “ Me man .
I ’m next . ”
“ What do you want ? ”
“ Make me a pussy , man . ”
“ Why do you want a pussy cat ? ” I asked knowing what he really meant .
“ No man .
I said a pussy .
So I can fuck it . ”
What do you say to that ? “ OK ? ” I do n’t think so .
I did n’t say anything and just shot him a disapproving look .
Then he changed his request .
“ Make me a woman . ”
I tapped him on the head with a balloon and said , “ Poof , you ’re a woman . ”
All the other kids laughed at him .
The boy did n’t like that too much .
One of the other boys spoke up .
“ You ’re my old lady , man . ”
What does that even mean ?
“ I ’m fuckin ’ talkin ’ to you clown . ”
Am I on candid camera ?
I gave them lollypops but they could n’t care less .
I was done with them .
My fifteen minutes were way up .
I glanced down the street and saw “ Daddy ” hold up a thumb to me and drive away .
I kept my promise .
I told them I was leaving .
One of the girls said to me , “ You ca n’t leave until we say . ”
“ You ’re wrong .
I ’m leaving NOW . ”
As I was packing away my balloon pump to leave , the mother finally made an appearance .
“ Where you goin ’ ? ”
She asked .
“ I saw Kim ’s father and he told me he wanted to cancel the show . ”
“ That mutha ’ fucka ’ ! ”
She turned around and ran inside the house .
So that ’s where the kids learned how to use the “ F ” - bomb .
The kids were all yelling obscenities at me as I was leaving .
I closed the chain link fence door behind me , turned , and addressed the children .
And by this point when I call them “ children ” I use the term loosely because it implies some sense of innocence .
A quality lost on these little ones .
“ By the way , you ’re all a bunch of little foul mouthed brats . ”
“ Fuck you , clown . ”
Oh , no… .
Fuck you .
“ Have a nice day . ”
I AM a Purple Dino Type .

Apple Security Update 2007-009 Can Cause Safari Crash

The Apple Security Update , 2007 - 009 , for Mac OS X Tiger and Leopard published on Monday could have subtle , adverse effects on operations in Safari .
It turns out that changes in Safari , in order to increase security , could cause crashes in some special circumstances .
That can happen due to the way the security update affects how frames are handled in Safari , according to TMO 's resident coding wizard , Stephen Swift .
" The error happens when the user tries to submit a form to another target frame or window .
Safari stops that , and , in fact , crashes .
The idea is to keep any malicious hacker from , for example , trying to load code into a hidden window , " Mr. Swift proposed .
[ However , crashing may not be the intended behavior . ]
The effect became noticeable right after the update was applied and TMO editors tried to work in our publication system .
Changes on the server side of our publication system had to be made to accommodate the way Safari now works .
The Security Update does not appear to affect OmniWeb 5.6 or FireFox 2.0.0.11 in that specific way .
We recently reported on how the controversy regarding the ostensible connection between vaccination and childhood autism had ensnared an innocent bystander .
Kathleen Seidel , who runs the Neurodiversity web site and blog , was targeted by a subpoena that demanded information on everything from her finances to her religious affiliations .
Seidel got good news on Monday , as her motion to quash the subpoena was granted .
The news was not so good for the lawyer that issued it , who now has to explain to the judge why he should n't be sanctioned for his actions .
Seidel was never actually a party to the lawsuit , which was started by the parents of an autistic child .
It initially targeted vaccine makers for their use of a mercury - containing preservative but , as charges have been thrown out and new ones filed , it has morphed into something nearly unrelated to the initial case , with more electric companies than drug makers involved .
Seidel was among the bloggers following the case and , for her efforts , received a subpoena that required her to produce financial records , contacts with fellow bloggers and the scientific community , and , most disturbingly , " communication with any religious groups ( Muslim or otherwise ) . "
She fought back , arguing that the subpoena was overly broad , unduly burdensome , and might actually impinge on various constitutional freedoms .
The ruling , filed in the US District Court of New Hampshire , is only a paragraph long , and kills the subpoena in the first sentence without explaining its reasoning .
The remainder of the paragraph , however , suggests that there was no need to drag the Constitution into things , as the initial filing appears to violate two of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure .
The ruling orders the attorney who initially filed the subpoena to " show cause within 10 days why he should not be sanctioned " for violating the federal rules .
Apparently , given the location where the case is being tried , the subpoena should have been filed in the Eastern District of Virginia , rather than in Seidel 's home state of New Hampshire .
The judge also indicated that the subpoena seemed unduly burdensome , as Seidel had argued .
Ominously , the ruling indicates that a failure to adequately address these issues will result in the attorney 's conduct being reported to the judge presiding over the lawsuit in Virginia .
In the end , as we suggested earlier , the numerous flaws in the subpoena allowed the judge that quashed it to rule on narrow grounds , leaving the status of bloggers as public voices or journalists unaddressed .
Given the intrusive nature of the subpoena , however , it 's difficult to be disappointed by this ruling .
When a company improves its environmental performance , it is common to think that the accompanying economic improvements are based on the company 's more efficient use of resources .
However ,
A new study in Strategic Management Journal reveals that financial markets reward green firms because those firms are seen as less risky .
Using data on 267 U.S. firms , Mark Sharfman and Chitru S. Fernando of the University of Oklahoma analyzed whether firms that had improved their environmental risk management also experienced a reduction in their total cost of capital , and found evidence supporting their hypothesis .
Financial markets seem to perceive greener firms as safer investments because of a reduced likelihood of litigation , government penalties , and / or catastrophic accidents .
The financial markets reward this lower level of risk by charging the firm less for its capital , thus allowing the firm to carry more debt .
In addition , firms benefit when individual investors seek out green firms , and the study shows that greener firms had higher levels of ownership by individual investors .
The broader the ownership of a firm 's stock , the lower its cost of equity capital .
Greener performance thus has the potential shorter - term and longer - term financial benefits .
As the authors note , " firms that make major investments in environmental performance may be providing the markets with an earlier signal about their longer term financial and stock performance . "

From Routledge / Earthscan : Essential background reading for people inside and outside the agri-food system who want to understand U.S. food policy and economics better .
Last night , Barack Obama beat expectations in both Indiana and North Carolina .
Let 's look carefully at how he managed this feat .
We 'll begin with Indiana .
Let 's compare the results from Indiana , Pennsylvania , and Ohio among select demographic groups .
As you can see , Clinton did about as well in Indiana as she did in Pennsylvania and Ohio with white men , white Protestants , and seniors .
However , beyond this , she suffered a decline among her best groups .
Notice in particular her decline among white women , white Catholics , and union households .
Basically , the core of her voting bloc was still with her , but Obama picked off a larger portion of it than he did in Ohio and Pennsylvania .
Why did this happen ?
It was n't because of southern Indiana .
All of the counties south of metro Indianapolis went for Clinton except Monroe County , where Indiana University is located .
Clinton won almost all of these counties in the south by at least 10 points .
In some instances , her margins were 30 and even 40 points .
All in all , the region bore a resemblance to southern Ohio , where Clinton did really well .
One big problem for Clinton came in metropolitan Indianapolis .
Obama beat her in metro
Indy by 17 points .
Much of this came from Marion County , where a large number of African Americans live .
However , discounting Marion County , she only won about 51.6 % of the vote .
Factor that in with her losses in Fort Wayne , South Bend ( home to Notre Dame , and thus a reason why she underperformed among white Catholics ) , and Gary , and we approach an answer to why the final result was so close .
What about North Carolina ?
It is instructive , I think , to compare the results from North Carolina to those of Tennessee and Virginia .
For the sake of perspective , let 's add some basic demographic features of the three states - namely median white income as of 2000 and the percentage of African Americans in the state .
We 'd expect a priori that as both figures fall , Clinton would do better .
As you can see , North Carolina performed roughly as we might expect , falling in between Virginia and Tennessee .
Nevertheless , it is surprising that the results were closer to the Virginia end ( i.e. Obama + 29 ) than the Tennessee end ( i.e. Clinton +13 ) .
What might explain the difference ?
Unlike Indiana , it does n't come from Clinton 's core voting group .
She did extremely well among white voters in North Carolina .
Obviously , she did n't do as well with them as she did in Tennessee .
However , she still trounced Obama among white men and white women , regardless of their religious affiliation .
Clinton 's problem was with the African American vote , which came in at about 33 % .
Her trouble in North Carolina , as well as the South in general , is that white voters are more likely to be Republican than in decades past .
This has given Obama a demographic edge in the region - one that has actually grown in the past few months .
Note that African Americans in North Carolina went for Obama more strongly than they did in either Tennessee or Virginia .
In fact , we can see a general trend in the African American vote toward Obama - not just in these states , but nationwide .
It has not been much commented upon - most likely because African Americans have been supporting Obama more strongly than any other group .
Nevertheless , as time has gone on , the African American vote has clustered around Obama much more tightly .
The following chart has the details .
It delineates Obama 's margin of victory among African Americans over time .
The states are divided into the South and non-South , then arranged chronologically .
We have to be careful not to over - interpret these results because they are relatively small sub -samples of each exit poll .
Nevertheless , there is a discernible trend in these numbers toward larger and larger Obama victories .
The African American vote now goes much more heavily for Obama than it did at the beginning of the cycle .
In fact , if we take Clinton 's margin among African Americans in Tennessee and apply it to North Carolina , keeping all else equal , Obama would have barely defeated her .
So , we can conclude that Clinton 's narrow victory in Indiana was largely because she did n't do as well with her strong groups as in Ohio and Pennsylvania .
However , she did do just as well in the south .
It was in metro Indy and in the north that she did n't do as well .
On the other hand , Obama 's extremely large victory in North Carolina was due to his strength among African Americans , a group with which he has improved over time .

A series of bombings in several major cities rocked Iraq today .
Overall , at least 31 Iraqis were killed and 70 were wounded in the latest attacks .
Most of the victims were civilians .
Also , three U.S. soldiers were killed in separate incidents .
During a combined IED and small arms attack , an MND - North soldier was killed today in Salah ad Din province .
A similar attack yesterday killed two MND - North soldiers and wounded two more .
In Baghdad , at least 15 people were killed and 33 more were wounded during a car bombing at a Shi’ite mosque in the Karrada district ; gunfire followed the explosion .
Another blast wounded two policemen in the Sahet al - Nussor neighborhood .

In the heart of Washington state ’s logging country , where it ’s a treasured pastime to curse the endangered spotted owl , you ’ll find one of the greenest paper mills around .
Tucked along the rainy coastline , Grays Harbor Paper produces some of the country ’s only 100 percent recycled paper in a plant powered entirely by biomass fuel derived from logging waste .
It was n’t always like this .
The mill , formerly owned by itt Rayonier and International Paper , shut down in 1992 , putting more than 600 people from nearby Hoquiam and Aberdeen out of work .
“ Families were breaking up and moving out , ” says Bill Quigg , a Hoquiam native who bought the mill in 1993 .
“ There were suicides .
It was really a hard time . ”
Today , Grays Harbor Paper employs more than 200 people and Hoquiam is home to one of the nation ’s largest biodiesel plants .
Like other areas that have been shut out of the postindustrial economy , Grays Harbor turned to renewable energy not for feel - good reasons but financial ones .
“ Politically I am on the right side of Genghis Khan , ” says Quigg .
“ I ’m not a lefty wacko . ”
Nevertheless , “ We make the greenest products , and we make them with the greenest fuel , ” he enthusiastically boasts .
“ Nobody else does that .
We have the audacity to think we can change the market .
If you buy local and smarter , you save a tremendous amount of fossil fuel . ”
Whether Quigg ’s strategy will work in the long run remains to be seen .
The mill runs on a tight budget ; its Harbor 100 recycled paper represents a mere 2 percent of sales .
Two years ago , the city of Seattle contracted to buy Harbor 100 for office use .
With a few more contracts like that , Quigg says , he can afford to make his plant even more environmentally sound and eventually build a recycled pulp mill to “ close the loop . ”
In the meantime , he says he ’ll keep taking advantage of the area ’s unique resources .
We do n’t know how to stop the trees from growing here , ” he says .
“ We live in the best biomass area in the continental U.S. ”
Grays Harbor is a case study of how investment in renewable energy can bring rural areas back from the doldrums , explains Rep. Jay Inslee , a Washington state Democrat and clean - energy advocate .
“ I love small towns , and I do n’t like to see them shriveling up , ” he says .
“ Grays Harbor is just one of hundreds of towns that are experiencing this rebirth . ”
Among the other down - and - out locales banking on alternative energy :
langdon , north dakota :
After watching its population blow away with its legendarily fierce winds , the town ’s leaders got an idea .
Last December , it became home to a $ 300 million , 106 - turbine wind farm that produces enough energy to power as many as 40,000 homes .
reynolds , indiana : Already known as “ BioTown , USA , ” Reynolds is trying to go completely off the grid by tapping into a local resource : cow and hog manure .
The town is about to break ground on an anaerobic digester , which will turn methane gas from animal waste into electricity .
clinton county , iowa : A refinery near the Mississippi pumps out 10 million gallons of biodiesel a year and supports 13 full - time jobs .
The nearly two - year - old plant used soybeans until prices tripled ; it now makes fuel from animal fats .

Half a century ago , the BMC Mini defined the modern econobox : a small front - mounted engine in a front - wheel - drive car that was easy to handle and compact yet spacious .
This vehicle design has since become a mainstay of the auto industry , the preferred way to propel more than 2,000 pounds of commuting fury forward .
But now the smallest cars — the Smart Fortwo , Mitsubishi's Japanese - market i , and India 's forthcoming Tata Nano — are all shifting gears .
Their engines are migrating to the back .
But these engines are n't cantilevered behind the rear wheels as in the original Beetle — with its consequent unpredictable handling .
The new configuration , called rear - mid - engine , places the motor under the rear seat and over the rear axle .
The result : spacious interiors , improved safety , and better road manners .
Because the power plant sits under the rear passenger , more of the car 's volume can be used for people and stuff .
The 11 - foot - long Mitsubishi i boasts the longest wheelbase in its class — 8 feet , 4 inches — making for an especially roomy cabin .
And there 's the reason Formula
One race cars — along with most Ferraris and Lamborghinis — mount their high - revving monsters in the middle .
It puts all that weight between the axles and closer to the car 's center of gravity , so there 's less danger of spinning out of control if the tires lose their grip .
Plus , in very small cars , a front - mounted engine can end up in your lap after a crash ; it does n't deform to absorb impact .
Move it to the back , though , and the front crumple zone can be deeper and crush more gradually .
The rear - mid layout also reduces production costs :
If the rear wheels do the driving , you eliminate the complexity and expense of transferring the engine 's power to axles that are spinning and steering .
It takes the philosophy of front - wheel drive and simplifies it to its essence .

The Heart Break of Romantic Relationship - part 2 ( This page is a continuation page of The Heart Break of Romantic Relationship . )
We are set up to fail to get our needs met in Romantic Relationships in the same way that we are set up to fail in life - by being taught false beliefs about who we are and why we are here in human body , false beliefs about the meaning and purpose of this dance of life .
As was stated on the first page :
" The issue of how we are set up to fail to get our needs met in Romantic Relationships is so complex - multi-leveled , multi-faceted , and multi-dimensional - that instead of writing an individual , fully contained article here I am going to make this Web Page a collage of different facets of this issue - individual vignettes with quotes from my books and articles .
I am going to use some quotes from my Question and Answer pages also - the Q & A # at the end of the quote will be a link to the applicable page - any articles or columns cited will also be linked . "
This page includes quotes from Codepenence : The Dance of Wounded Souls and quotes from other articles , columns , and web pages written by Robert Burney .
The internal links within this article open in a separate browser window .
Facet # 3 - Shame Core - Inner Child Healing
" The dance that we learn as children - the repression and distortion of our emotional process in reaction to the attitudes and behavior patterns we adopt to survive in an emotionally repressive , Spiritually hostile environment - is the dance we keep dancing as adults . "
***
" That shame is toxic and is not ours - it never was !
We did nothing to be ashamed of - we were just little kids .
Just as our parents were little kids when they were wounded and shamed , and their parents before them , etc. , etc .
This is shame about being human that has been passed down from generation to generation .
There is no blame here , there are no bad guys , only wounded souls and broken hearts and scrambled minds . "
***
" If we are reacting out of what our emotional truth was when we were five or nine or fourteen , then we are not capable of responding appropriately to what is happening in the moment ; we are not being in the now .
When we are reacting out of old tapes based on attitudes and beliefs that are false or distorted , then our feelings can not be trusted .
When we are reacting out of our childhood emotional wounds , then what we are feeling may have very little to do with the situation we are in or with the people with whom we are dealing in the moment .
In order to start be-ing in the moment in a healthy , age - appropriate way it is necessary to heal our " inner child . "
The inner child we need to heal is actually our " inner children " who have been running our lives because we have been unconsciously reacting to life out of the emotional wounds and attitudes , the old tapes , of our childhoods . "
All quotes in this color are from Codependence : The Dance of Wounded Souls Codependence is a dis-ease of reaction .
As long as we are in reaction we are being a victim .
We are not owning our power if we are reacting .
Many of us have reacted to being hurt in Romantic Relationships by going to the other extreme - overreacting to the point where we spent many years out of relationship .
Then we try a relationship again and have another disaster because we are reacting to our childhood programming and we again react to our reaction by overreacting to the other extreme .
In Recovery we are working on getting the pendulum swing smaller and smaller - finding the middle ground , the place of balance .
Overreacting to our patterns is just as dysfunctional as reacting to the wounds that caused the patterns .
If we discover a pattern - say , that we leave relationships before we can be left - and we overreact and decide to stick it out in the next relationship no matter what , that can lead to us accepting a lot of abuse in the name of recovery .
If we are in reaction and trying to figure out what is right and wrong - we are giving power to the disease .
There are no mistakes only lessons - which are painful but not that painful if we are not judging and shaming ourselves .
What makes lessons so painful is the shame the disease lays on us - in other words - the disease creates all of this fear about getting hurt until we are terrified of being hurt - but what is so painful about being hurt is the shame that the disease beats us up with after we get hurt .
The hurt itself passes - the shame and judgment the disease abuses us with is what is most painful .
We are programmed to believe that making a " mistake " is horribly shameful .
We are programmed to believe that if we do not find " Happily - ever - after " in a Romantic Relationship then we have made a mistake , or something is wrong with us .
When a relationship does n't work out we torture ourselves with recriminations about what we did " wrong " or what is " wrong " with us .
We rip ourselves for the shame of " failing . "
" Our intuition / gut / heart tells us the Truth - it 's our head that screws things up .
I understand perfectly why my friend is in reaction the way she is - I am just very sad that it means she can't be in my life .
She and I both come from a place of having so much terror of intimacy that we were relationship phobic - sometimes what is necessary for someone with a relationship phobia is to jump right in , that may be the only way past the fear .
I am happy to say that I do n't have a relationship phobia anymore - I welcome another chance to explore a relationship now that I know that my worst fear can come true and it can make me stronger and better and happier .
The reason for that is that I did not give power to the shame - what a miracle !
What a gift !
I am so grateful . "
An Adventure in Romance by Robert Burney Codependence Recovery is not self - help .
We are being guided .
The Force is with us !
Romantic Relationships are part of the curriculum in this school of Spiritual Evolution - not the place we find happily ever after .
Life is a journey - it is not about reaching a destination .
" As I said , the goal of healing is not to become perfect , it is not to " get healed . "
Healing is a process , not a destination - we are not going to arrive at a place in this lifetime where we are completely healed .
The goal here is to make life an easier and more enjoyable experience while we are healing .
The goal is to LIVE .
To be able to feel happy , Joyous , and free in the moment , the majority of the time .
To get to a place where we are free to be happy in the moment most of the time , we need to change our perspectives enough to start recognizing Truth when we see or hear it .
And the Truth is that we are Spiritual Beings having a human experience that is unfolding perfectly and always has been , there are no accidents , coincidences , or mistakes - so there is no blame to be assessed .
The goal here is to be and enjoy !
We can't do that if we are judging and shaming ourselves .
We can't do that if we are blaming ourselves or others .
We must start recognizing our powerlessness over this disease of Codependence .
As long as we did not know we had a choice we did not have one .
If we never knew how to say " no , " then we never really said " yes . "
We were powerless to do anything any different than we did it .
We were doing the best we knew how with the tools that we had .
None of us had the power to write a different script for our lives .
We need to grieve for the past .
For the ways in which we abandoned and abused ourselves .
For the ways we deprived ourselves .
We need to own that sadness .
But we also need to stop blaming ourselves for it .
It was not our fault !
We did not have the power to do it any differently .
***
" It is when we start understanding the cause and effect relationship between what happened to the child that we were , and the effect it had on the adult we became , that we can Truly start to forgive ourselves .
It is only when we start understanding on an emotional level , on a gut level , that we were powerless to do anything any differently than we did that we can Truly start to Love ourselves .
The hardest thing for any of us to do is to have compassion for ourselves .
As children we felt responsible for the things that happened to us .
We blamed ourselves for the things that were done to us and for the deprivations we suffered .
There is nothing more powerful in this transformational process than being able to go back to that child who still exists within us and say , " It was n't your fault .
You did n't do anything wrong , you were just a little kid . " ***
" It is necessary to own and honor the child who we were in order to Love the person we are .
And the only way to do that is to own that child 's experiences , honor that child 's feelings , and release the emotional grief energy that we are still carrying around . "
It was not our fault .
We were set up to fail in Romantic Relationships .
It is very important to forgive ourselves - not just intellectually , but to actually go back to the wounded parts of our self and change our relationship with our self .
We cannot Love someone else in a healthy way until we learn to Love ourselves - and we cannot love our self without owning all of the parts of us .
" Unfortunately , in sharing this information I am forced to use language that is polarized - that is black and white .
When I say that you cannot Truly Love others unless you Love yourself - that does not mean that you have to completely Love yourself first before you can start to Love others .
The way the process works is that every time we learn to Love and accept ourselves a little tiny bit more , we also gain the capacity to Love and accept others a little tiny bit more . "
We can access our Higher Self to be a Loving Parent to the wounded parts of our self .
That Loving Adult within us can set a boundary with the Critical Parent to stop the shame and judgment and can then Lovingly set boundaries with whatever part of us is reacting so that we can find some balance - not overreact or under react out of out fear of overreacting .
We need to establish Loving on - going relationships with the wounded parts of us in order to be able to stop reacting out of our wounds and our shame .
The process of learning how to set internal boundaries is the single most powerful method I have ever seen or heard of for Learning to Love our self .
Once we start Loving , honoring , and respecting our self then we have a chance to be available in a healthy way for a Loving Romantic Relationship .
" We cannot learn to Love ourselves and be at peace within until we stop judging and shaming ourselves for being human and stop fighting our own emotional process , until we stop waging war on ourselves . "
" The message that you should n't do it because it will cause conflict with your spouse is probably not for your Highest good .
If taking care of your self causes conflict with your spouse then you may need to take another look at the relationship - either by yourself or hopefully with him to see if the conflict can be mediated ( setting boundaries in a relationship is about 95 % negotiation - boundaries for the most part are n't rigid - some are , like it is not ok to hit me or call me certain names or cheat on me , etc. - but most boundaries are a matter of negotiation , which of course involves communication . )
As I have mentioned communication is really difficult .
Because we all have a little child inside of us who learned that it is shameful to be wrong or make a mistake - too often in relationships the attempts at communication end up as a power struggle between who is right and who is wrong .
One person takes the others feedback as an attack and then attacks back .
Again the wrong question is being asked - a relationship is a partnership , an alliance , not some game with winners and losers .
When the interaction in a relationship becomes a power struggle about who is right and who is wrong then there are no winners . "
Q & A # 5
Facet # 4 - Emotional Dishonesty - Emotional Intimacy " We are set up to be emotionally dysfunctional by our role models , both parental and societal .
We are taught to repress and distort our emotional process .
We are trained to be emotionally dishonest when we are children . "
***
" Our traditional cultural concepts of what a man is , of what a woman is , are twisted , distorted , almost comically bloated stereotypes of what masculine and feminine really are .
A vital part of this healing process is finding some balance in our relationship with the masculine and feminine energy within us , and achieving some balance in our relationships with the masculine and feminine energy all around us .
We cannot do that if we have twisted , distorted beliefs about the nature of masculine and feminine . "
" The first long term relationship ( for me 2 years was very long term because of my particular terror of intimacy ) I got into in recovery I realized that for me to set boundaries or get angry in an intimate relationship felt to my inner child like I was being a perpetrator - which was the thing ( being like my father ) that I had hated so much and vowed I would never be - so I had to learn to let my inner child know that it was ok to say no and have boundaries in an intimate relationship and that it did n't mean I was being a perpetrator . "
Q & A # 4
We learn who we are as emotional beings from the role modeling of our parents and the adults around us .
I have never had an emotionally honest male role model in my life .
I am having to become my own role model for what emotional honesty looks like in a man .
Romance means nothing without emotional intimacy .
" In - to - me - see " We can not share our self with another being unless we can see into our self .
As long as I could n't be emotionally intimate with myself , I was incapable of being emotionally intimate with another human being .
It is absolutely vital to learn how to be emotionally honest with ourselves .
It is impossible to have a Truly successful Romantic Relationship without emotional honesty .
( Truly successful being used here to mean : in balance and harmony between the physical , emotional , mental , and Spiritual levels of being . )
Sex can ultimately be an empty , barren animal coupling - involving physical pleasure but really having little to do with Love - without emotional & Spiritual connection .
This results in one of the major problem areas of many relationships .
Without emotional intimacy many women get turned off to sex and withhold because their emotional needs are n't being met - and men get angry because they do n't even have a clue of what women are asking for .
" Traditionally in this society women were taught to be codependent - that is take their self - definition and self - worth from their relationships - with men , while men have been taught to be codependent on their success / career / work .
That has changed somewhat in the past twenty or thirty years - but is still part of the reason that women have more of a tendency to sell their souls for relationships than men do . "
Relationships & Valentines Day by Robert Burney
It is a double set up for women in this society .
First of all the men were taught that it was not manly to be emotional and that what makes them successful as a man is what they produce - and then women were taught that they needed to be successful in romantic relationships with emotionally unavailable men in order to be successful as a woman .
What a set up !
It is not women 's fault .
It is also not men's fault .
It is a set up .
" I also want to add here that one of the damaging concepts that I was taught as a child is that you can not be angry at someone you love .
My mother once in my recovery said to me directly " I can't be angry at you , I love you . "
( That she has lived for 50 years with a man whose only emotion is anger , who raged all the time , makes a very sad statement . )
If you can not be angry at someone you cannot be emotionally intimate with that person .
Any friend who I can not get angry at ( or vise versa ) and then at some later point communicate with and work through whatever issue is up - is not really a friend .
It was very important for me to learn how to fight in a romantic intimate relationship ( I have some ages of my inner child that thought that if I stood up for my self she would go away . )
It is important to learn to fight " fair " ( that is , not say those really hurtful things that can't be taken back .
I found that I could stand up for myself and fight fair even when the other person did not fight fair . )
But unless we can express our anger - as well as our hurt , fear , and sadness - to another person we can not be emotionally intimate with them .
It can be wonderfully magical in a relationship when both people are in recovery working on healing their childhood wounds .
An argument over one of the stupid , seemingly meaningless things that couples often argue about can turn into a mutual grieving session - talk about powerful intimacy .
Example : A fight starts , angry words are exchanged , then ( sometimes at the time one of the people can say " How old are your feeling right now ? " or sometimes after time has passed , sometimes after a " time out " that is structured into the relationship ) one of the individuals says " I feel about 7 . "
" What happened when you were 7 ? " etc. - and you can end up figuring out that the tone of voice one person used pushed a button about how Mom used to talk to them in a way that made them feel stupid - and when the first person reacted to that it pushed a button for the other person about how Dad used to do whatever .
And you both get to cry for the ways you were abused or discounted or invalidated .
It is very important to remember that the Universe works on the principle of cause and effect - our reactions do not come our of the blue , they have a cause .
What we are trying to learn to do is stop reacting to the now out of the past .
We can do that by tracking down the cause instead of getting all tied up in the symptom ( whatever started the argument . )
It is dysfunctional to react to the now out of the past because our reaction is only a little bit about what is happening now . "

( Includes Sexuality , Metaphysical , and Reasons to take the Risk )
A top banker at UBS has been " briefly detained " by the US authorities investigating whether the Swiss bank helped its American customers evade tax .
The bank confirmed last night that the US department of justice ( DOJ ) is carrying out the investigation .
It refused to name the banker but the Financial Times identified him as Martin Liechti , head of UBS 's wealth management operations in North and South America .
Wealth management is the core of UBS 's private banking operations and Liechti is believed to have been held during a visit to Miami last month .
The Financial Times said that he had been held as a " material witness " and is to stay in the US while talks with the DOJ continue .
It was unclear why he was in the US last week , the paper added .
The DOJ is investigating investment advice UBS gave its US private banking clients between 2000 and 2007 while the main financial regulator , the SEC , is also investigating whether employees of the Swiss bank failed to register with it as required .
German prosecutors clamping down on thousands of rich Germans using trusts in Liechtenstein and Switzerland are also investigating the bank over suspicions it helped clients evade taxes .
The latest revelation is yet another blow for the reputation of UBS which yesterday said it had lost a record Sfr11.54bn ( £ 5.6bn ) in the first quarter and would axe 5,500 jobs , including 2,600 in its stricken investment banking division .
It has been forced to write down Sfr37bn in assets .

Researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago have discovered how some bacteria can survive antibiotic treatment by turning on resistance mechanisms when exposed to the drugs .
The findings , published in the April 24 issue of the journal Molecular Cell , could lead to more effective antibiotics to treat a variety of infections .
" When patients are treated with antibiotics some pathogenic microbes can turn on the genes that protect them from the action of the drug , " said Alexander Mankin , professor and associate director of the University of Illinois at Chicago 's Center for Pharmaceutical Biotechnology and lead investigator of the study .
" We studied how bacteria can feel the presence of erythromycin and activate production of the resistance genes . "
Erythromycin and newer macrolide antibiotics azithromycin and clarithromycin are often used to treat respiratory tract infections , as well as outbreaks of syphilis , acne and gonorrhea .
The drugs can be used by patients allergic to penicillin .
Macrolide antibiotics act upon the ribosomes , the protein - synthesizing factories of the cell .
A newly - made protein exits the ribosome through a tunnel that spans the ribosome body .
Antibiotics can ward off an infection by attaching to the ribosome and preventing proteins the bacterium needs from moving through the tunnel .
Some bacteria have learned how to sense the presence of the antibiotic in the ribosomal tunnel , and in response , switch on genes that make them resistant to the drug , Mankin said .
The phenomenon of inducible antibiotic expression was known decades ago , but the molecular mechanism was unknown .
Mankin and his team of researchers -- Nora Vazquez - Laslop , assistant professor in the Center for Pharmaceutical Biotechnology , and undergraduate student Celine Thum -- used new biochemical and genetic techniques to work out the details of its operation .
" Combining biochemical data with the knowledge of the structure of the ribosome tunnel , we were able to identify some of the key molecular players involved in the induction mechanism , " said Vazquez - Laslop .
" We only researched response to erythromycin - like drugs because the majority of the genetics were already known , " she said .
" There may be other antibiotics and resistance genes in pathogenic bacteria regulated by this same mechanism .
This is just the beginning . "
The research was funded through a grant from the National Science Foundation .
SAN FRANCISCO 
A federal judge on Friday withdrew his earlier order disabling a Web site that allows the anonymous posting of documents to discourage unethical behavior in governments and corporations .
On Feb. 15 , the judge , Jeffrey S. White of Federal District Court in San Francisco , ordered the American address of the site , Wikileaks.org , to be disabled at the request of Bank Julius Baer & Company , a Swiss banking company , and its Cayman Islands subsidiary .
They charged that Wikileaks had posted confidential , personally identifiable account information on some of the bank ’s customers .
The judge ’s action drew criticism  and court filings  from numerous organizations concerned that the order violated the First Amendment protection of free speech .
Because Wikileaks operates sites , like Wikileaks.cx , in other countries , the documents were and are still widely available , both in the United States and elsewhere .
In reversing himself at a hearing here on Friday , Judge White acknowledged that the bank ’s request posed serious First Amendment questions and might constitute unjustified prior restraint .
He also appeared visibly frustrated that technology might have outrun the law and that , as a result , the court might not be able to rein in information once it had been disclosed online .
The government 's failure to tackle the growing problem of fuel poverty was yesterday branded a social disaster after it emerged that record numbers of vulnerable households are struggling to pay gas and electricity bills .
According to its own advisers , the government " appears to have given up trying to hit its legally binding target " to reduce fuel poverty , which now blights around 4.5 m homes nationally .
In its annual report published today , the Fuel Poverty Advisory Group ( FPAG ) said more than 2.3 m of the most vulnerable households in England alone are now forced to spend at least 10 % of their income to heat and light their home .
Across the UK , the number of households in fuel poverty is now at the highest level since Labour came to power .
The advisory group criticised ministers for cutting the grants programme aimed at those in fuel poverty by a quarter during the comprehensive spending review .
This , it said , was despite the Treasury receiving significantly higher VAT receipts on the back of gas and electricity prices that have doubled in recent years .
Peter Lehmann , the outgoing chair of FPAG , yesterday warned the government that it stood no chance of meeting its target of eradicating fuel poverty in vulnerable households .
" The recent measures in the budget , and the Ofgem investigation into the way the market works , are to be welcomed .
However , it is difficult to understand why spending on Warm Front , the government 's flagship fuel poverty programme , is being cut by nearly 25 % in real terms .
Fuel poverty has been relegated to a minor status in the government 's target framework , " he said .
Help the Aged seized on the report as proof of how ineffective the government 's strategy had become .
" It 's not just a policy failure - it 's a social disaster for the estimated one in six older households struggling to live in fuel poverty , " said the organisation .
" Their number is set to reach the highest level in over a decade .
But fuel poverty is not just a statistic - it is a measure , however approximate , of the pain and misery , illness and even death which stems from people living in cold homes which are expensive to adequately heat . "
A spokeswoman for the Department for Business , Enterprise and Regulatory Reform said ministers would continue to " explore options and do all that is reasonably practicable to meet them .
" The government is in discussion with the energy suppliers about how best to take forward the budget announcement on proposals to increase energy companies ' spend on social programmes to £ 150 m a year . "

Libbygate : Now to the Real Story
KNOW YOUR GOVERNMENT : Libbygate : Now to the Real Story by DAVE LINDORFF
Congress should take the cue and initiate impeachment proceedings against Bush and Cheney based on the evidence of crimes and obstruction that came out during the Libby trial testimony .
S o Scooter Libby has taken the fall .
Three and a half years and a long bloody war after he and a gang of war - mongers in the White House and Blair House , including President Bush and Vice President Cheney , set out to undermine and trash the reputation of an Iraq war critic , former ambassador Joseph Wilson , Libby has been found guilty of perjury , lying to the FBI and obstruction of justice by a Washington jury .
Now maybe special counsel Patrick Fitzgerald and what passes for journalists in the mainstream media can get down to the real business of finding out just why the entire White House smear operation was unleashed upon a minor state department official and why they went so far as to violate federal law and expose his CIA - operative wife , Valerie Plame , in the process destroying her entire network of contacts for monitoring the spread of nuclear weapons in the Middle East .
Because that 's what this whole Libby story is really about .
The whole focus of the media in this case has been on the narrow , inside - the - Beltway question of who leaked information about Plame to the media .
Entirely forgotten or ignored has been what this leak was all about to begin with .
For that , you have to go back and look at what Wilson did in the first place that so enraged or frightened the Vice President and the President .
And that was to go to Niger , one of the poorest nations in Africa , to prove conclusively that there was no truth to a set of forged notes on the letterhead of the Niger embassy in Rome , purporting to be receipts for 400 tons of Niger uranium ore allegedly being sought by Iraq 's Saddam Hussein .
Wilson knew those documents were cheap forgeries -- the name of the mines official on the papers was someone who had n't been in office for years -- but he went to Niger anyhow , just to make doubly certain that no such purchase attempt had been made .
None had .
So the real question then is , who is behind those forged documents ?
There is an interesting story here -- and an important mystery to be solved .
As it happens , way back in early 2001 there was a pair of burglaries at the Niger Embassy in Rome and at the home of the Niger ambassador .
Police investigating the crimes found that the only things stolen were official stationary and some official stamps , used to make documents official .
A cleaning lady and a former member of Italy 's intelligence service were arrested for the crimes .
They were odd burglaries to be sure , since there is precious little one could use , or sell , such documents for , given the country involved .
I mean , it might make sense to steal official stationary from the French Embassy in Rome , which a thief might use to finagle a pass to the Cannes Festival .
But Niger ?
Jump to October 2001 .
A few weeks after the 9 - 11 attacks , Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi , accompanied by his ministers of defense and intelligence , made a visit to the White House .
There he reportedly handed over the forged Niger documents ( they were on Niger government stationary , and had Niger government stamps ! ) , which appeared to be receipts for uranium ore , made out to Saddam Hussein .
Now forget the matter of why either Hussein or Niger 's government would want paper receipts for such an illegal transaction , and forget the matter of how Hussein would have transported 400 tons of yellow dust across the Sahara to his country without somebody noticing .
The simple fact is that Bush 's own intelligence experts at the CIA and State Department promptly spotted the forgeries , and they were dumped .
We know this because we know , from the likes of onetime National Security Council counterterrorism head Richard Clarke and former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill , that Bush was pushing for war with Iran almost as soon as he finished reading My Pet Goat following the attack on the Twin Towers .
Surely if the White House had even thought those Niger documents might be legit , they would have leaked or broadcast them all over creation .
They did n't .
The documents were deep - sixed , and mentioned to no one .
But according to some dedicated investigative reporters at the respected Italian newspaper La Repubblica , they resurfaced before long at a very suspicious meeting .
This meeting occurred in December 2001 in Rome , and included Michael Ledeen , an associate of Defense Department Undersecretary for Policy Douglas Feith and a key figure in the White House 's war - propaganda program , Larry Franklin , a top Defense Intelligence Agency Middle East analyst who later pleaded guilty to passing classified information to two employees of the America Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) , convicted Iraqi bank swindler Ahmed Chalabi , then head of the CIA - created Iraqi National Congress , and Harold Rhode of the sinister Defense Department Office of Special Plans , that office set up by the White House and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld under Feith 's direction to manufacture " evidence " to justify a war on Iraq .
Also at this peculiar meeting were the heads of the Italian Defense Department and of SISMI , the Italian intelligence agency .
According to La Repubblica , it was at that meeting that a plan was hatched to resurrect the forged Niger documents , and to give them credibility by recycling them through British intelligence .
And that is what Bush was referring to when , in his 2003 State of the Union address , he famously frightened a nation by declaring , " The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa . "
Bush lyingly implied that this was new information , when in fact he knew - - had to know -- that the " evidence " in British hands was the same set of documents he had been offered by Berlusconi almost a year and a half earlier , which had been declared to be bogus .
No mainstream American media organization has pursued this story , or even published the details as reported in Italy .
Most Americans , consequently , do n't even know what a grand lie Bush and the White House perpetrated upon them and the Congress in order to win approval for an attack on Iraq .
Perhaps now that Libby has gone down for his part in this grotesque crime , some editor will ask the obvious question :
Why did the White House and the Office of Vice President go to such extraordinary lengths to attack Wilson and his wife ?
And more importantly , who was behind those Niger embassy burglaries and the forged uranium ore sale documents ?
And what was OSP doing meeting in Rome in December 2001 with the head of Italian intelligence ?
Make no mistake : this whole story has the odor of a " black op " designed to target the American people .
If so it was an act of high treason .
It is not just Libby who should go to jail for this crime .
It is the president and vice president .
At this point , what should happen is that Fitzgerald , with Libby in the bag , would take the next step and hold the prospect of a lengthy prison sentence recommendation over the convict 's head in order to try and win from him a promise of cooperation with the prosecution .
Because Libby knows who was behind all this .
That 's the way prosecutors go after criminal syndicates and conspiracies , but Fitzgerald has folded his tent , reportedly saying that he plans no further prosecutions .
That means it 's up to Congress , which should take the cue and initiate impeachment proceedings against Bush and Cheney based on the evidence of crimes and obstruction that came out during the Libby trial testimony .
And of course , it 's up to the media , which if they were still doing their job , would be all over this story .

In 1950 , Dr. Seuss published a book called “ If I Ran the Zoo . ”
It contained the sentence : “ I ’ll sail to Ka - Troo , and bring back an IT - KUTCH , a PREEP , and a PROO , a NERKLE , a NERD , and a SEERSUCKER , too ! ” According to the psychologist David Anderegg , that ’s believed to be the first printed use of the word “ nerd ” in modern English .
The next year , Newsweek noticed that nerd was being used in Detroit as a substitute for “ square . ”
But , as Ander -egg writes in his book , “ Nerds , ” the term did n’t really blossom onto mass consciousness until The Fonz used it in “ Happy Days ” in the mid- to late - 1970s .
And thus began what you might call the ascent of nerdism in modern America .
At first , a nerd was a geek with better grades .
The word described a high - school or college outcast who was persecuted by the jocks , preps , frat boys and sorority sisters .
Nerds had their own heroes ( Stan Lee of comic book fame ) , their own vocations ( Dungeons & Dragons ) , their own religion ( supplied by George Lucas and “ Star Wars ” ) and their own skill sets ( tech support ) .
But even as “ Revenge of the Nerds ” was gracing the nation ’s movie screens , a different version of nerd - dom was percolating through popular culture .
Elvis Costello and The Talking Heads ’s David Byrne popularized a cool geek style that ’s led to Moby , Weezer , Vampire Weekend and even self - styled “ nerdcore ” rock and geeksta rappers .
The future historians of the nerd ascendancy will likely note that the great empowerment phase began in the 1980s with the rise of Microsoft and the digital economy .
Nerds began making large amounts of money and acquired economic credibility , the seedbed of social prestige .
The information revolution produced a parade of highly confident nerd moguls  Bill Gates and Paul Allen , Larry Page and Sergey Brin and so on .

That ’s why we created this list of 100 ways to save money starting today .
None of these tactics will be life - changing on their own , but they can make quite a difference over time if you ’re able to implement more than one .
Some of these suggestions take just a few minutes , while others require a bit of regular effort .
Still , they ’re all incredibly simple – anyone can do them .
Obviously , not all of these tips will apply to everyone .
Just go through the list and find 10 or 15 that do apply to you and use them in your life .
When you do , you may quickly find that you ’re saving more money than you ever thought possible .
100 Ways to Save Money
1 . Move bank accounts to take advantage of perks and earn more interest
If you ’re paying a monthly fee for your checking or savings account , you would benefit from researching some of newest banking offers out there .
Not only do some of the best banks offer sign - up bonuses simply for opening an account and setting up direct deposit , but some offer attractive interest rates to new customers as well .
It ’s true that interest rates are not what they once were , but it ’s still worth a look .
Some of the best free checking accounts and best savings accounts can be found online .
Here ’s a guide on how to make that switch .
2 . Turn off the television .
One big way to save money is to drastically cut down on the amount of television you watch .
There are a lot of financial benefits to this : less exposure to spending - inducing ads , a lower electric bill ( and perhaps a lower cable bill if you downgrade your subscription ) , more time to focus on other things in life — such as a side business — and so on .
Want to take things a step further ?
Consider cutting the cord to cable TV altogether .
3 . Stop collecting , and start selling
There was a time when people thought their collections would bring them riches .
Beanie Babies were a big fad at one time , as were Longaberger baskets .
Now you can find those items on resale sites like Craigslist and at garage sales for a fraction of their initial cost , leaving many people who sunk thousands of dollars into their “ investments ” wondering what happened .
If you want to avoid that situation , do n’t collect items of questionable value .
And if you want to recoup some of the money you ’ve already spent on collectible items , you can start selling them now and use those funds for any number of worthy financial goals .
Read our “ Guide to Selling Unwanted Items ” for some simple strategies that can help you profit as much as possible .
4 . Sign up for every free customer rewards program you can .
No matter where you live , you ’ll find plenty of retailers who are willing to reward you for shopping at their store .
Here ’s the basic game plan for maximizing these programs : create a Gmail or Yahoo address just for these mailings , collect every card you can , and then check that account for extra coupons whenever you ’re ready to shop .
You can add to those rewards and discounts by using rewards credit cards to earn points on purchases at a wide range of stores that can be redeemed for cash back or other benefits .
5 . Use credit cards wisely .
If you have a habit of overspending with credit cards , hide your cards and keep them in a safe place in your home , not in your wallet .
Keeping your card “ out of sight and out of mind ” might help reduce temptation while you ’re out and about .

6 . Master the 30 - day rule .
Avoiding instant gratification is one of the most important rules of personal finance , and waiting 30 days to decide on a purchase is an excellent way to implement that rule .
Quite often , after a month has passed , you ’ll find that the urge to buy has passed as well , and you ’ll have saved yourself some money simply by waiting .
If you ’re on the fence about a purchase anyway , waiting a while can give you a better perspective on whether it ’s truly worth the money .
7 . Write a list before you go shopping – and stick to it .
One of the easiest ways to save money is to only shop when you have a list .
Because when you ’re without one , you typically end up making impulse buys and unplanned purchases – all things that cost money .
Creating a list before you go to the grocery store is especially important .
Not only can it help you buy items that fit with your meal plan , but it can also help you avoid buying food you might waste .
Always create a list and , more importantly , stick to it .
You can also take advantage of a cash back rewards card that gives bonus cash at grocery stores – just be sure to pay off the balance each month .
8. Invite friends over instead of going out .
Going out to eat or “ out on the town ” has a way of completely destroying both your food budget and your entertainment budget in one fell swoop .
And no matter what , it is always cheaper to stay in with friends and come up with your own entertainment .
Instead of hitting the town , host a fun pitch - in dinner with your friends .
Play cards , sit around a fire pit , or watch movies with your guests .
You ’ll all save money – and have a blast .
9 . Repair clothing instead of tossing it .
Do n’t toss out a shirt because of a broken button – sew on a new one with some closely - matched thread .
Do n’t toss out pants because of a hole in them – put in a patch of some sort and save them for times when you ’re working around the house .
Most basic sewing jobs can be completed by anyone , and a little bit of practice goes a long way .
Learning basic sewing skills is a great way to save some money – and extend the life of your clothing .
10 .
Do n’t spend big money entertaining your children .
Most children , especially young ones , can be entertained very cheaply .
Buy them an end roll of newspaper from your local paper and let their creativity run wild .
Play ball in the backyard .
Head to the park .
Plant a garden .
Teach them to ride a bike without training wheels once and for all .
Realize that what your children want most of all is your time , not your stuff , and you ’ll find money in your pocket and joy in your heart .
11 . Negotiate rates with your credit card company or complete a balance transfer .
If you ’re paying a lot of interest on your credit cards , it ’s important to know that you do have some power as long as you ’ve been making your payments .
Not only do you have the right to negotiate your current interest rate with your credit card issuer , but you have the right to transfer your balance to an entirely different card as well .
( In fact , that is perhaps your biggest bargaining chip . )
Start by calling your card issuer at the number on the back of your card and explaining your request .
If you do n’t make any progress with them , check out these balance transfer credit cards to find one with an introductory 0 % APR that could help you save hundreds of dollars in interest over time .
12 . Clean out those closets .
Go through your closets and find anything and everything you no longer use .
Then , do n’t just get rid of it , use it to your benefit .
You can have a yard sale with it , sell it on eBay or Craigslist , take it to a consignment shop , or even donate it for the tax deduction ( mark down what you give away so you can get a receipt ) .
All of these options can turn old stuff you do n’t want anymore into money in your pocket .
Not only that , it ’s often a psychological load off your mind to clean out your closets .
13 .
Buy video games that have a lot of replay value – and do n’t acquire new ones until you ’ve mastered what you have .
My video game buying habits have changed quite a bit since my “ game of the week ” days .
Now , I focus on games that can be played over and over and over again , and I focus on mastering the games that I buy .
Good targets include puzzle games and long , involved quest games – they maximize the value of your gaming dollar .
Once you ’re done with a game for good , take it to a video game resale shop like GameStop and see if you can trade it in for store credit you can use to get another game .
14 . Drink more water .
Not only does drinking plenty of water have great health benefits — it has financial benefits , too .
Drink a big glass of water before each meal in order to stay fuller longer and ultimately eat less .
Not only will you save on the food bill , but you ’ll also feel better after you become properly hydrated .
Even better , drinking more water — whether in a refillable bottle or at restaurants — means spending less money on beverages like soda , juice , and tea .
Remember : Tap water is not only just as clean as bottled water , it ’s also free .
15 . Avoid convenience foods and fast food .
Instead of eating fast food or just nuking some prepackaged dinner when you get home , try making some simple and healthy replacements that you can take with you .
An hour ’s worth of preparation one weekend can leave you with a ton of cheap and easy dinner and snack options for the following week .
Also consider breaking out the ol ’ crock pot for some inexpensive meal options that not only save money , but time , too .
For those times when you simply can’t avoid dining out , maximize your savings with coupons and a rewards credit card that gives a bonus for restaurant spending ( but you know yourself best , so only spend what you know you can pay off each month with no interest ) .
16 .
For heaven ’s sake , quit smoking .
If you ’re still a smoker , you have to know by now that your habit is not only expensive , but potentially deadly as well .
If you want to add years to your life and save a boatload of money , the easiest thing to do is to stop smoking altogether .
You can quit cold turkey , try some of the many anti-smoking products that are out there , or switch to an electronic cigarette to buy some time .
Whichever path you choose , you will be much better off .
17 . Make a quadruple batch of a casserole .
We all know that casseroles are nice , easy dishes to prepare .
The next time you make a casserole , make four batches of it and put the other three in the freezer .
Then , when you need a quick meal for the family , you can grab one of those ready - made casseroles and just heat it up .
Preparing a few at once allows you to buy the ingredients in bulk , which can mean additional savings .
Meanwhile , having several casseroles in the freezer makes it less likely that you ’ll turn to fast food or junk food when you ’re in a hurry .
18 . Turn off the lights .
Keeping the lights on in your home may not be expensive on a per-watt basis , but it sure does cost money over time .
To save as much as you can , turn off lights any time you leave your house – or even when you leave the room .
Turning off lights when you have plenty of natural sunlight can also help keep your electric bill down over time .
The bottom line :
If you are n’t using a light , turn it off .
19 . Swap books , music , and DVDs on the Internet or at the library .
You can very easily swap the books , CDs , and DVDs you ’ve grown bored with online .
Just clean out your media collection , and trade them with others online using sites like PaperBackSwap .
If you live near a library that loans DVDs in addition to books , you ’ll be even better off .
The more you can borrow and barter with others , the more money you ’ll save over time .
20 . Maximize yard sales .
Yard sales are a great place to score awesome deals on items you need anyway – think housewares , shoes , clothing , or even sports equipment .
The key is , you have to be careful not to use the low prices found at sales as an excuse to buy things you do n’t need .
At your next garage sale , limit yourself to items that were already on your list of things to buy .
21 . Install CFLs or LEDs wherever it makes sense .
Energy - efficient light bulbs might cost a bit more initially , but they have a much longer life than normal incandescent bulbs and use far less electricity .
It might be hard to decide which type to use , but either type of bulb will probably be an upgrade from whatever you ’re using now .
CFLs , which use a quarter of the energy of incandescent bulbs and last for years , are the next cheapest option after traditional bulbs .
But they also have some drawbacks :
They take a while to warm up to full brightness , and they also contain a small amount of mercury .
Meanwhile , LEDs are more expensive .
However , they ’re getting cheaper all the time , and they are easily the best lighting option available :
They light up instantly , are efficient as CFLs , produce a warm glow without getting hot to the touch , and can last for decades .
You do n’t even need to replace every bulb in the house at once .
Even swapping just your four or five most - used light bulbs can save you $ 45 or more a year .
22 . Install a programmable thermostat .
Installing a programmable thermostat is a no- brainer if you want to cut down on energy usage while you ’re not at home , or simply regulate the temperature in your home .
By setting it to heat or cool your home at certain times , you can ensure that your utilities are n’t being wasted while you ’re at work or asleep – and save money in the process .
23 . Buy quality appliances that will last .
It ’s worth the time to do a bit of research when you buy a new appliance .
A reliable , energy - efficient washer and dryer might cost you quite a bit now , but if it continually saves you energy and lasts for 15 years instead of five , you ’ll save significant money in the long run .
When you need to buy an appliance , do research : Start with back issues of Consumer Reports at the library .
An hour ’s worth of research can easily save you hundreds of dollars .
Additionally , consider utilizing a professional to install appliances to ensure they are installed properly and will last in the long - run .
If you know you ’re going to spend a significant amount and you already have the cash on hand , you might want to consider applying for a credit card with a generous signup bonus .
Buying a $ 2,000 + refrigerator can help hit that spending minimum quickly .
It ’s a simple way to earn some money on a purchase you were going to make anyway .
24 . Clean or change out your car ’s air filter .
A clean air filter can improve your gas mileage by up to 7 % , saving you more than $ 100 for every 10,000 miles driven in an average vehicle .
Cleaning your air filter is easy to do in just a few minutes – just follow the instructions in your vehicle ’s manual and you ’re good to go .
If yours is beyond help , also consider changing it out for a new one .
At most stores , a new air filter goes for less than $ 10 .
25 .
Make your own gifts instead of buying stuff from the store .
If you want to save money while also giving generously , creating your own homemade gifts is one way to accomplish both goals .
You can make food mixes , candles , fresh - baked bread or cookies , soap , and all kinds of other things at home quite easily and inexpensively .
These make spectacular gifts for others because they involve your personal touch — something you ca n’t buy from a store — and quite often they ’re consumable , meaning they do n’t wind up filling someone ’s closet with junk .
Even better – include a personal handwritten note with the gift .
26 . Plan your meals around your grocery store ’s flyer .
Instead of creating your meal plan out of thin air , plan all your meals around what ’s on sale in your grocery store ’s flyer .
Look at the biggest sales , then plan recipes based on those ingredients and what you have on hand .
Do that for a few months and you ’ll find yourself with a much smaller food bill than you ’re used to .
27 .
Do a price comparison – and find a cheaper grocery store .
Most of us get in a routine of shopping at the same grocery store , and we may not even realize that we ’re not getting the best deal .
Fortunately , there ’s a simple way to find the cheapest store around .
Just keep track of the 20 or so things you buy most often , then shop for these items at a variety of stores .
Eventually , one store will come out on top for your purchases – just make that one your regular shopping destination and you ’ll automatically save money .
28 . Make your own when you can .
Before I tried it myself , I thought making homemade bread would just be a complicated waste of time .
But after I tried it , I found that it was pretty easy and it was actually much cheaper , healthier , and tastier than buying a loaf from the store .
We rarely ever buy bread at the store these days , mainly because the bread I make is not only cheaper , but much better too .
Figuring out what you can make it home is a great way to save some money – and learn new skills along the way .
29 . Avoid stress - spending .
It ’s easy to justify spending money just to wind down from a stressful day at work .
However , it ’s rarely a good idea .
Instead of buying things you do n’t need to make yourself feel better , it might be wise to find other ways to de-stress instead .
Exercise is always a good option , as is meditation and even a good old - fashioned nap .
Read , watch movies , or work in your yard if you ’re stressed out .
Spending money wo n’t reduce your stress in the long run .
30 .
Share your dreams with people you love .
This seems like an odd way to save money , but think about it .
If you spend time with the people you love the most and come to some consensus about your dreams , it becomes easy for you all to plan for it .
Set a big , audacious goal together and encourage each other to be financially fit – soon , you ’ll find you ’re doing it naturally and your dreams are coming closer than ever .
31 . Do a “ maintenance run ” on your appliances .
Check them to make sure there is n’t any dust clogging them and that they ’re fairly clean .
Look behind the appliances , and use your vacuum to gently clear away dust .
Check all of the vents , especially on refrigerators , dryers , and heating and cooling units .
The less dust you have blocking the mechanics of these devices , the more efficiently they ’ll run ( saving you on your energy bill ) and the longer they ’ll last ( saving you on replacement costs ) .
32 . Cancel unused club memberships .
Are you paying dues at a club that you never use ?
Like , for instance , a gym membership or a country club membership ?
If you ’re on the fence about any of your memberships or find that you ’re not using them very often , cancel them .
Remember , you can always renew the membership at a later date if it turns out that you actually do miss it .
33 .
Buy used when you can .
You can often find the exact item you want with a bit of clever shopping at used equipment stores , used game stores , consignment shops , and so on .
Just make these shops a part of your normal routine – go there first when looking for potential items and you will save money .
Clothes , for example , often cost pennies on the dollar when bought used – even if they were only worn once .
By buying used most of the time , you can save a ton of cash .
34 . Shop for new auto and / or home insurance .

If you own a car or home , insurance is pretty much a given , and you want to ensure you ’re getting the best deal for your needs .
It can be beneficial to shop around for a new car insurance or home insurance policy every few years to make sure you are getting that best deal .
35 . Remove your credit card numbers from your online accounts .
It ’s easy to spend online when you have your card information stored in an account – just click and buy .
The best way to break this habit is to simply delete your card from the account .
That way , when you ’re tempted to spend , you ’ll be forced to spend the time to dig out your card – and really think about why you ’re spending this money .
Sometimes being forced to take that extra step is all it takes to convince yourself you do n’t need the item after all .
36 . Give the gift of labor .
For new parents , give an evening of babysitting as a gift .
If you know pet owners , offer to take care of their pets when they travel .
Offer up some lawn care as a gift to a new homeowner .
These types of gifts are always a hit .
I know that , as a parent of a toddler and an infant , I loved receiving a babysitting gift , probably more than any “ stuff ” I might get otherwise .
37 .
Do holiday shopping right after the holidays .
Most people use this technique for Christmas , but it works for every holiday .
Wait until about two days after a holiday , then go out shopping for items you need that are themed for that day .
Get a Mother ’s Day card for next year the day after Mother ’s Day .
Get Easter egg decorating kits the day after Easter , and Halloween decorations on Nov. 1 .
Get wrapping paper , cards , bows , and gift bags the day after Christmas .
The discounts are tremendous , and you can just put this stuff in the closet until next year .
38 . Join up with a volunteer program .
Volunteering is a great way to meet new people , get some exercise , and involve yourself in a positive project that can lift your spirit .
It also comes without a cost to you and can provide a lot of entertainment and a fulfilling day when you ’re in the right mindset .
( In some cases , it can even help erase your student loans . )
I ’ve come to spend more and more of my time volunteering , serving on various committees and groups in the community .
It is hands - down the best thing I have ever done .
39 .
Declutter to save your sanity and some cash .
Go into a room and go through every single item in it .
Do you really need that item ?
Are you happy that it ’s there , or would you be just fine if it were not ?
If you can find stuff to get rid of , get rid of it – it just creates clutter and it might have some value to others .
You also improve the perceived value of your house – and you ’re likely to get a lot of cleaning done in the process .
It ’s a frugal win - win - win .
40 .
Try generic brands of items you buy regularly .
Instead of just picking up the ordinary brand of an item you buy , try out the store brand or generic version of the item .
You ’ll save a few cents now , but you ’ll also likely discover that the store brand is just as good as the name brand — often , the only difference between the two is the marketing , which I ’m not willing to pay more fore .
Once you ’re on board the generic train , you ’ll find your regular grocery bill getting smaller and smaller .
41 . Prepare some meals at home .
Get an accessible and easy - to - use cookbook ( my favorite “ beginner ” cookbook is Mark Bittman ’s excellent “ How to Cook Everything “ ) and try making some of the dishes inside .
You ’ll find that cooking at home is much easier than you think – and way cheaper and healthier than take - out or dining out .
Even better , you can easily prepare meals in advance – even handy fast - food type meals .
42 . Switch to term life insurance .
Repeat after me : insurance is not an investment .
If you ’re stuck in an expensive whole life policy , choose cheaper term insurance instead and use that difference in cost to get yourself out of debt and start building some wealth .
Universal and whole - life policies are much more expensive and offer a subpar investment opportunity .
In almost every case , you ’ll be much better off with a cheap term policy and more money in your pocket .

43 . Stick to reliable , fuel - efficient cars .
A reliable and fuel - efficient car will save you thousands over the long haul .
Let ’s say you drive a vehicle for 80,000 miles .
If you choose a car that gets 25 miles per gallon over one that only gets 15 , you ’ll save 2,133 gallons of gas .
At $ 3 a gallon , that ’s $ 6,400 in savings right there .
Reliability can pay the same dividends .
Do the research :
It will pay off for you .
Learning some simple strategies for fuel - efficient driving can also help .
44 . Avoid the mall .
The mall might be a fun place to people watch , but it can also be packed with temptation .
That ’s why you should avoid the mall unless you actually need to purchase something .
Trust me , window shopping when you ’re on a budget can be torture .
Unburden yourself and find something else to do when you need some entertainment .
A walk outdoors , a fun puzzle , or a good movie can easily replace your regular mall shopping adventures .
45 . Master the 10 - second rule .
Whenever you pick up an item and add it to your cart or to take it to the checkout , stop for 10 seconds and ask yourself why you ’re buying it and whether you actually need it or not .
If you ca n’t find a good answer , put the item back .
This keeps me from making impulse buys on a regular basis .
46 . Rent out unused space in your home .
Do you have an extra bedroom or in - law suite that ’s not being used ?
Rent it out on a site like Airbnb.com .
If you live near a popular or tourist area , doing so could bring in a lot of extra money .
Just make sure you know the risks and are willing to take the steps required to protect your family and your possessions .
47 . Create a visual reminder of your debt .
To put your debt into terms that are easy to understand , make a giant progress bar that starts with the amount of debt you have and ends with zero .
Each time you pay down a little bit , fill in a little more of that progress bar .
Keep this reminder in a place where you ’ll see it often , and keep filling it in regularly .
It can help keep your eye on the prize and lead you straight to debt freedom .
48 . Cancel magazine subscriptions .
Do you have a pile of unread magazines sitting around your house ?
It ’s likely the result of a subscription that you ’re not reading .
Not only should you not renew that magazine , but you should give their subscription department a call and try to cancel for a refund .
You never know until you ask– they might even give you the prorated amount back .
I ’ve had to cull my subscriptions in the past , and I ’ve never regretted it .
An app like TrueBill can even review your purchase history to find forgotten subscriptions and other recurring charges , and help you cancel or renegotiate them for a cheaper rate .

Probably a Lot More Than You Think
49 . Eat breakfast .
Eating a healthy breakfast fills you up with energy for the day while also curbing your desire for a big , expensive lunch .
Meanwhile , breakfast can be very healthy , quick , and inexpensive .
A bowl of oatmeal in the morning is often the one thing that keeps me from running out to eat an expensive lunch later in the day .
50 .
Swap babysitting with neighbors .
We live in a neighborhood with dozens of families with young children .
Because of that , there are a lot of parents out there willing to swap babysitting nights with us , saving us the money of hiring one for an evening out .
A few families even take this to incredible extremes .
Try to find another set of parents or two that you trust , and swap nights of babysitting with them .
If you can pull it off , you ’ll get occasional evenings free without the cost of a babysitter and save a ton of money in the process .
51 . Do n’t fear leftovers : Jazz them up instead .
Many people feel as if leftovers are just inferior rehashes of regular meals .
However , there ’s nothing cheaper than eating leftovers , and with a few techniques for making leftovers tasty , you can often end up with something surprising and quite delicious on the other end .
My favorite technique ?
Chaining – using the leftovers as a basis for an all - new dish .
For example , if you have leftover ham and rice from last night ’s meal , use them to make fried rice or black beans and rice tonight .
52 .
Go through your clothes – all of them .
If you have a regular urge to buy clothes , go through everything that you have and see what you might find .
Take the clothes from the back of the closet and bring them to the front , and suddenly your wardrobe will feel completely different .
Take the clothes buried in your dresser and pull them to the top .
You ’ll feel like a brand new person who does n’t need to spend money on clothes right now .
53 . Brown bag your lunch .
Instead of going out to eat at work , take your own lunch — if not every day , then at least a couple of times a week .
With some thoughtful preparation and just a few minutes of time , you can create something quite enjoyable for your brown bag lunch – and save a fistful of cash each time you do .
Your co-workers may not understand your desire to save money , but that ’s their problem .
54 . Learn how to dress minimally .
Buy clothes that mix and match well and you wo n’t need nearly as many clothes .
If you have five pants , seven shirts , and seven ties that all go together , you basically have an endless number of options already .
This is exactly what I do in order to minimize clothing purchases and still look professional – I just mix and remix what I wear by using timeless , simple pieces that go well together .
55 .
Ask for help and encouragement from your inner circle .
When you ’re feeling discouraged , sit down and talk to the people you love and care about the most and ask them for help .
Tell them that you ’re trying to trim your spending and you ’d love it if they would offer any suggestions and support they might have .
Then , pay attention to what they tell you .
They might have some personal insights for your situation that will really help .
At the very least , they might understand your situation better .
56 .
Try to fix things yourself .
Years ago , it was far more difficult to find ways to fix everyday items we have in our homes .
But today , it should be a piece of cake .
You can find online tutorials and videos that show you how to fix almost anything , and all for free .
No matter what you ’re trying to fix , it ’s always worth a shot .
Learning a new skill never hurts either .
57 .
Keep an idea notebook in your pocket .
I ’ve wasted countless amounts of time and money simply because I ’ve forgotten some of my best ideas .
Nowadays , I keep a small notebook with me to jot down ideas so that I never forget anything important .
This keeps me from forgetting the ideas I have throughout the day .
58 . Invest in a deep freezer .
A deep freezer can be a great bargain after the initial investment , but only if you ’ll use it .
Often , having some extra freezer space allows you to buy in bulk and pay lower prices overall .
Even better , you can store lots of meals prepared in advance , enabling you to just go home and pop something homemade ( and cheap ) in the oven .
Read this post if you need help determining whether a deep freezer is worth it .
59 .
Look for a cheaper place to live .
The cost of living in Iowa is surprisingly low , enough so that I ’m quite happy to give up the cultural opportunities of other places to enjoy Iowa all year round .
When I want to enjoy the cultural attractions of another place , I ’ll travel there – after all , I can afford it because I save on living expenses the rest of the year .
If you live in a truly expensive area , take some time to decide if the extra expense is really worth it .
You may find that a move could mean the difference between having plenty of money and barely scraping by .
60 .
Check out free events in town .
My town has several wonderful parks , free basketball and tennis courts , free disc golf , trails , and lots of other stuff just there waiting to be used .
You can go have fun for hours out in the wonderful outdoors , playing sports , hiking on trails , or trying other activities – and it ’s all there for free .
All you have to do is discover it .
Here are more than a hundred free things to do if you need more inspiration .
61 . Inflate your tires .
For every two PSI of air pressure under the recommended level in your tires , you lose 1 % on your gas mileage .
Most people ’s car tires are five to 10 PSI below the normal level , so that means by just inflating your tires , you can improve your gas mileage by up to 5 % .
It ’s easy , too : Just read your car ’s manual to see what the recommended tire pressure is , then head to the gas station .
Ask the attendant inside if they have a tire air gauge you can borrow ( most of them do , both in urban and rural settings ) , then stop over by the air pump .
Check your tires , then use the pump to fill them up to where they should be .
It ’s basically free gas !
62 . Start a garden .
Gardening can be an inexpensive hobby if you have a yard .
Just rent a tiller , till up a patch , plant some plants , keep it weeded , and you ’ll have a very inexpensive hobby that produces healthy food for your family .
I like planting a bunch of tomato plants , keeping them cared for , then enjoying the huge flood of tomatoes at the end of each summer .
We like to eat them fresh , can them , and make tomato juice , sauce , paste , ketchup , pasta sauce , and pizza sauce .
63 .
Dig into your community calendar .
Most communities have a ton of free events , although you may not know about them at the time .
If you want to stay abreast of everything going on nearby , check out your town ’s website or stop by the local library or city hall and ask how you can get ahold of a listing of upcoming community events .
You can often get free meals , free entertainment , and free stuff just by paying attention – even better , you ’ll get in touch with what ’s going on around you .
64 . Take public transportation .
If the city ’s transit system is available near you , take it to work instead of driving your car .
It ’s far cheaper and you wo n’t have to worry about the added expense or hassle of parking your vehicle either .
When I lived in a larger city , I bought an annual transit pass that actually paid for itself after less than two months of use compared to using an automobile .
After that , for 10 months , I basically could ride to work ( and to some events ) for free .
That ’s money in the bank .
65 . Cut your own hair .
This may not be a popular idea , but it works if you have a simple hairstyle .
I cut my own hair with a pair of clippers , for example .
It may seem like an impossible feat , but it really is n’t that hard to learn how .
Just put a garbage bag over the bathroom sink , bust out the clippers and scissors , and get it done .
Two or three cuts will pay for the clippers , and then you ’re basically getting free haircuts .
With a bit of practice , you can make it look good , too .
66 . Carpool .
If you live near anyone you work with , you might both be able to benefit by carpooling to work .
Or perhaps your spouse works nearby — if so , consider whether it would make sense to take one car back and forth each day .
Doing so could save money and wear and tear on both of your vehicles .
67 . Design your ‘ debt snowball . ’
Everyone needs a plan to help them get out of debt , so sit down and plot out which debts you ’re going to pay off and in what order .
Simply having a plan goes a long way toward putting that plan into action , and paying off debts early is one of the surest ways to put money in your pocket over the long run .
68 . Get a crock pot .
A crock pot or slow cooker is perhaps the best deal on earth for reducing cooking costs in a busy family .
You can just dump in your ingredients before work , put it on simmer , and dinner is done when you get home .
There are countless recipes out there for all variety of foods , and every time you cook this way , you ’re saving money compared to eating out .
Crock pot meals are also notoriously good as leftovers , which can mean additional savings .
69 .
Do some basic home and auto maintenance on a regular schedule .
Instead of waiting until something breaks to deal with it , develop a monthly maintenance schedule where you go around your home ( and your car ) and perform a bit of maintenance where it ’s needed .
This little activity , taking you just an hour or two a month , will keep things from breaking down and help you catch problems before they become disasters .
Maintaining your home can also keep it in better shape and improve the value of your property over time .
70 .
Buy staples in bulk .
With items we use a lot of , we buy them in bulk , and that ’s particularly true when it comes to items that do n’t perish .
For example , we buy trash bags , laundry detergent , and diapers in the largest packages we can find .
This cuts down on their cost per usage by quite a bit and , over the long haul , adds up to significant savings .
71 . Pack food for road trips .
Whenever you ’re ready to hit the road , take some time to pack snacks and meals you can easily eat on the go .
That way , instead of stopping in the middle of the trip , driving around looking for a place to eat , spending a bunch of time there , and then paying a hefty bill , you can just eat on the road or , better yet , stop at a nice park and stretch for a bit .
Convenience foods are notoriously expensive , so you ’re better off avoiding them whenever possible .
72 . Go through your cell phone bill , look for services you do n’t use , and ditch them .
There are plenty of strategies to save money on your cell phone bill , and that includes switching from one of the big legacy providers to one of the smaller companies offering service in your area for less .
At the very least , you should take a look at your monthly bill and see if you are paying for any services you are n’t using .
73 . Consolidate your student loans .
Interest rates are very low right now , so depending on the type of loans you have , it could be worthwhile to consolidate your student loans into one low - rate package .
It ’s just one way to tackle student debt , but consider the various student loan consolidation packages available and see what you might save : Even a 1 % reduction on a $ 10,000 loan saves you $ 100 a year , and your loan is probably bigger than that ( and the rate cut you could get is probably bigger ) .
74 .
When buying a car , look only at used models .
It ’s hard to argue with the fact that new cars make terrible investments .
Not only do they drop in value the moment you drive off the lot , but they continue dropping in value with each year that goes by .
If you want to save as much as possible on transportation , look only at used cars in relatively good condition .
If you focus on cars that are only a few years old , you may also be able to find one within its warranty period .
75 .
Hit the library – hard .
Do n’t look at a library as just a place to borrow books .
Look at it as a free place to do all sorts of things .
I ’ve used it to learn a foreign language , meet people , use the Internet in a pinch , check out movies and CDs , grab local free newspapers , and keep up on community events .
Best of all , it does n’t cost a dime .
76 . Use a simple razor to shave .
I ’ve been a big advocate of the basic safety razor for a long time , but that ’s just one piece of the puzzle .
For “ normal ” shaves , I just shave in the shower and dry off the blade afterwards — using just soap for lather is also incredibly cheap since I only swap blades once every few weeks .
The real moral of the story ?
Use a simple razor — not an expensive electric one that stops working in three years , or the newest swiveling multi- blade model with its expensive replacement cartridges — and shave your face when it ’s wet .
You can get a very good shave with some practice and save a lot of money over the long haul .
77 . Find daily inspiration for making intelligent moves .
I ’m usually inspired by my children .
Perhaps you ’re inspired to make changes by your spouse – or even by someone in the community you respect .
Maybe it ’s just a personal goal , like an early retirement .
Find something that makes you want to make positive changes , then use that person or thing as a constant reminder .
Keep a picture of it in your wallet , in your vehicle , and on your bathroom mirror .
Keep it in your mind as much as you possibly can .
78 . Learn about all of the benefits your company offers .
Spend some time with an HR person at work learning about all the benefits of your job – you might be surprised at what you find .
After sitting down with someone at my job , I gained access to free tickets to sporting events , free personal improvement opportunities , and an optional employee match on some retirement funds that maximized the money I was socking away .
This not only cut down on my own spending on things like sporting and community events and educational classes , but also improved my retirement plan .
79 .
Make your own cleaning supplies instead of buying them .
I like to make my own laundry detergent and my own Goo -Be -Gone , for starters .
I also like making my own Glade , Windex , and Soft Scrub .
In all these cases , it ’s way cheaper than buying the commercial versions .
Hunt around for recipes – it ’s amazing how many things you can make at home in just a few minutes to save a ton of money compared to the commercial version .
Our Frugal Spring Cleaning Checklist can give you some ideas .
80 . Suggest cheap activities when meeting up with family and friends .
This is often a tricky thing to do , but there are a number of techniques you can try .
My favorite one is to be the first one to suggest something – that often gives you the power to steer the group towards things that are cheaper .
If you can convince your friends to go to the park and shoot hoops instead of going golfing , for example , those greens fees are going to stay in your pocket .
81 . Do n’t speed .
Not only is speeding inefficient in terms of gasoline usage , it also can get you pulled over and cost you a bundle between a ticket and higher insurance premiums , as I discovered a while back .
It ’s far more cost - efficient to just drive the speed limit , keep that gas in the tank , and keep the cops off your tail .
82 . Read more .
Reading is one of the cheapest – and most beneficial – hobbies around .
Most towns have a library available to the public – just go there and check out some books that interest you .
Then , spend some of your free time in a cozy place in your house , reading away .
You ’ll learn something new , improve your reading ability , enjoy yourself , and not have to spend a dime .
Here are some more ways to get into the reading flow .
83 . Buy a smaller house .
There are plenty of reasons to buy less house than you can afford .
I currently live in a 2,000 - square - foot house with my wife and two kids .
Frankly , it ’s just the right size for us – if anything , it ’s a little big .
We often find ourselves in the same room in the house , just surrounded by empty space .
You do n’t need a giant place to live .
Instead , buy something more modest and you ’ll find yourself with plenty of room – and still plenty of cash in your pocket .
84 . Drive a different route to work .
This is an especially powerful tip if you find yourself “ automatically ” stopping for something on the way into work or the way home .
Get rid of that constant drain by selecting a different route that does n’t go by the temptation , even if the new route is a bit longer .
You ’ll still save time by not stopping , and the money you save on any unnecessary indulgences you avoid will add up over time .
85 . Always ask for fees to be waived .
Any time you sign up for a service of any kind and there are sign - up fees , ask for them to be waived .
Sometimes ( but not always ) , they will be – and you save money just by being forthright about not wanting to pay excessive fees .
I did this with my last cell phone sign - up and got them to wave the fees , lowering my bill significantly .
86 . Do n’t overspend on hygiene products .
Most people would probably find that inexpensive hygiene products work just as well as the expensive stuff .
Personally , I just buy whichever toothpaste is the cheapest , and the same goes with deodorant and the like .
The key is to use this stuff regularly and consistently – bathe daily , keep yourself clean , and you ’ll be just fine .
No need to buy a $ 40 facial scrub if you actually scrub your face properly .
87 . Eat less meat .
Meat is very expensive when you consider its nutritional value , especially as compared to vegetables and fruits .
And in almost every case , protein - packed staples like beans offer a much better value .
Even if you do n’t want to become a full - fledged vegetarian , you can still save a bundle just by eating meat less often .
88 . Use a brutally effective coupon strategy .
To save as much money as possible , use the coupons in conjunction with your grocery store flyer and shopping list .
Doing so can help you save double – both through the initial sale savings and through the use of the coupon .
This strategy also helps you avoid purchasing items you do n’t really need just because you have a coupon or discount .
89 .
Air seal your home .
Most homes have some air leaks that make the job of keeping it cool in summer and warm in winter that much harder – and that much more costly for you .
Spend an afternoon air sealing your home and keep your energy dollars from leaking out .
The DoE has a great guide on basic air sealing .
90 .
Make your own beer or wine .
If you enjoy an occasional drink , this is a great way to enjoy some of your favorite beverages at a steep discount .
You can easily make five gallons of beer or wine at once and it does n’t take that long once you ’ve mastered the process .
Even better , it ’s a great activity to do with friends – you buy the equipment , they bring the juice , and you both get a few bottles of delicious homemade wine out of the deal .
Some nice entertainment , plus some free beverages – that ’s a great frugal deal .
91 .
Make sure all your electrical devices are on a surge protector .
This is especially true of your entertainment center and your computer equipment .
A power surge can damage these electronics very easily , so spend the money for a basic surge protector and keep your equipment plugged into such a device .
To save even more , unplug anything you are n’t using frequently to avoid phantom energy use .
92 . Get on the automatic repayment plan for any student loans you have .
Many student loans offer a small rate reduction if you sign up for their automatic debt repayment plan .
This way , not only do you save a few bucks a month — you do n’t have to go to the effort of actually paying the bill either .
Our automatic plan saved us about $ 60 a year .
93 .
Cut down on your vacation spending .
Instead of going on a big , extravagant trip , pack up the car and see some of the sights in your surrounding area .
One of the best vacations I ’ve ever taken was when my son was an infant – we just packed up the car and drove around Minnesota , eventually camping for a few days along the north shore of Lake Superior .
For a weeklong relaxing vacation , it was incredibly cheap and quite memorable , too .
Another strategy is to look into travel rewards credit cards for ways to earn free hotel stays and airfare .
94 .
Cancel the cable or satellite channels you do n’t watch .
Many people with cable services often are paying for a premium package that they do n’t really need .
For the longest time , my wife and I were subscribed to HBO , Starz , and Cinemax , yet we would only tune in once a month at best .
We argued that it was worth it because we could watch a movie or a great drama whenever we wanted , but it would have been far cheaper just to rent a movie .
Get rid of the channels you do n’t need and put that cash back in your pocket .
95 . Exercise more .
Go for a walk or a jog each evening , practice stretching , or partake in some light muscle exercise at home .
These exercises can be done at home for free , but can lead to huge benefits to your health .
Just set aside some time each day to get some exercise , and your body and wallet will thank you .
96 . Utilize online bill pay with your bank .
This serves two purposes .
First , it keeps you in much closer contact with your money , as you can keep a very close eye on your balance and be that much less likely to overdraft .
Second , it saves you money on stamps and paper checks by allowing you to just fill in an online form , click submit , and have your bill paid .
Try it out – and take advantage of it if you ’re not already .
Some of the best free online checking accounts offer this perk .
97 .
Connect your entertainment center and / or computer setup to a true smart power strip .
A device like a SmartStrip can cut power to all devices on the strip once a control device is turned off to reduce phantom power drains .
So , if you have your workstation hooked up to this , every time you power down your computer , your monitor powers down , your printer powers down , your scanner powers down , and so on .
You can do the same thing with your entertainment console :
When you turn off the television , the cable / satellite box also goes off , as does the video game console , the VCR , the DVD player , and so on .
This can save you a lot of electricity and significantly trim your power bill .
98 .
Do n’t beat yourself up when you make a mistake .
Even if you make 10 good choices , it ’s easy to beat yourself up and feel like a failure over one bad choice .
If you make a big mistake and realize it , think about why you realized it now instead of then , and try to apply that later on .
The memory of that mistake can end up being very valuable , indeed .
99 .
Always keep looking ahead .
Do n’t let the mistakes of your past drag you down into more mistakes .
Instead , look ahead to the future .
Learn to see past mistakes for what they are – lessons that were meant to teach you something .
Sometimes the best life lessons are learned through life experience , good or bad , so embrace your past and do n’t run from it .
Promising to do better and setting goals can help keep mistakes where they belong – in the past .
100 .
Never give up .
Whenever the struggle against debt feels like it ’s too much , go read a personal finance blog and remember that there are a lot of people out there fighting the same fight .
Read around through the archives and learn some new things – and perhaps get inspired to keep going , no matter what .
