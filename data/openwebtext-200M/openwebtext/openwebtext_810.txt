I was called into his school to speak with the teacher recently .
Her explanation of why Seb had received three detentions in one week made me laugh which is not the reaction she expected .
Detention 1 Raised his hand during math class and asked if Kate ( a large girl in his class ) did n't eat for five weeks , would she get skinny or die ?
Detention 2
Told a classmate , " I heard the teachers saying that your parents died today and you are going to have to live at the school . "
Detention 3
While the principal was explaining the ' no nut policy ' during school assembly , Seb yelled , " That 's a lot of nuts ! " after watching the movie Kung Pow the night before .

Hamas would recognise Israel if it withdraws to its pre-1967 borders , a French Jewish writer said this week after meeting the exiled leader of the Palestinian Islamist movement , Khaled Meshaal .
" He told me that Hamas was prepared to recognise Israel on the lines of June 4 , 1967 .
He told me so several times , " Marek Halter told AFP on Monday .
The date refers to Palestinian demands for an end to Israeli occupation of the West Bank , Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem , captured in the 1967 war .
Halter 's meeting with Meshaal took place in Damascus last month , on the eve of Israel 's 22 - day offensive , which left more than 1,330 Palestinians dead , according to Gaza medics , and vast swathes of the territory in ruins .
The writer said he informed Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni of Meshaal 's comments at the start of the Gaza conflict , which ended on January 18 as Israel and Hamas declared unilateral ceasefires .

Before diving into one of the most lucrative data science sectors , it is vital to know the key differences between machine learning and data science and how they go hand in hand .
Machine learning is a subset of Data science but when it comes to the ......
The US food supply is being taken over at this moment through regulations most people have never heard of or know about .
Click here .
For years , environmentalists have been struggling to stop pesticides that are deadly to everything , and food safety people have been trying to stop GMOs that are threaten to human health and all of nature , and farming groups have been trying to stop regulations that make farming literally impossible .
The arguments for organic farming and freedom to farm go beyond argument - it is patently obvious that is the only thing that makes any sense whatsoever .
So , why is industrial agriculture - which is depleting and contaminating our water supply , filling animals with drug after drug that make us sick , using such disgusting practices it has created Mad Cow and Bird Flu , wiping out fish stocks in the ocean with poisonous run-off into the Mississippi , causing suicides by the 10s of thousands in India and our own farmers deaths in huge numbers in the 80s here , destroying farming communities and the democratic base they provide this country , killing bees , and giving us diabetes and heart disease and cancers - pre-eminent over an agriculture that is simply and by all common - sense , good ?
Discrimination .
Look hard at that word .
It is unfamiliar within the paradigm of agriculture but it is the unseen bedrock reality and it is the source of all the insanity mentioned above .
The poisoning of the earth , the mutating of nature , the dying of bees and farmers , do not derive from an even remotely just system but from one as systematic and malign as racism , and with same infiltration of government and extra-governmental use of terror to prevail .
Monsanto is currently in the process of wiping out hundreds of farmers in southern Illinois and destroying previously close communities through fear and paranoia .
Within a frame of " agriculture " or defending " patents , " it somehow passes as " normal " to have hired thugs trespassing , harassing , threatening , tracking , and abusing farmers and then pushing them into bankruptcy through lawsuits against patent infringement .
Click here .
Pulled from an agricultural frame , though , one can see that those patents as similar to laws that defined slaves as 3/ 5 of a man legally , because they , too , contravene all equal and natural rights of each individual to what is inherently theirs - in the first case , freedom and a vote , and in the second case , ownership of nature itself .
And Monsanto is also acting as did the KKK , striking fear into communities on purpose , to cow farming communities and even to eliminate them in what it calls " rural cleansing . "
Click here .
A discriminatory group has intruded itself into a setting in which all people once had equal rights over nature , and it has managed to alter the entire system of rights which no one had noticed as " rights " before ( access to nature being so unconsciously assumed ) .
This immense overturning of justice did not happen accidentally but derived from extremely corrupt means - inserting a Monsanto employee , Clarence Thomas , onto the Supreme Court to make rulings that genetically altered organisms were no different from normal ones , and then on intellectual property law which allowed fro the take - over of nature through genetic engineering .
People have recognized that this gave Monsanto a massive benefit - a lock on ownership of whatever it screwed with .
But what has been missed is that those rulings by a black " Justice " destroyed previously taken for granted and thus undefined civil and human rights around nature .
The approach to pesticides has been similar .
They have been seen merely as a product to be tested and approved or not approved , but something primary has been missing in that - a recognition that the corruption of the process is a civil rights issue .
" Life , " liberty and the pursuit of happiness .
In those words , it becomes plain that health , and thus what is done to threaten nature , the source of all life , is a civil right .
Lost within " agriculture " and " commodities " or " profit " or " studies " is the profound truth that this is about life or death and our civil rights to life .
One group is using corrupt means to discriminate against a defined segment of the population - all of us who wish to live .
We are used to seeing discrimination personified - George Wallace in the school house door blocking little black children from getting an education , and Bull Connor setting fire hoses and dogs on peaceful black protesters .
That template became the defining one for civil rights - white over blacks , good people being stopped by the government .
But it does not fit civil rights abuses now .
Today , government is not the rescuer but itself is attacking a marginalized group and stands between it and something they need .
This is even harder to recognize now that Obama is president - for he is a black man overseeing a government that is discriminating and abusing a marginalized group .
Who is the marginalized group ?
It is hard to see as well because it is all of us .
And what is that group being denied through discriminatory laws and practices ( and armed raids ) ?
What we all need to survive - nature in a healthy state and full freedoms to it .
And who is being discriminated in favor of ?
Multinational corporations such as Monsanto .
It makes for a much harder to draw political cartoon because the discrimination is so total and the government , run by a black man , is part of it .
But let 's look at only a couple of examples to see how it works precisely as discriminatory laws worked against the civil rights of blacks .
Voting rights were the heart of civil rights because they defined the equal personhood of black people .
To block them from this civil right , poll taxes were interposed between them and the vote .
They " were allowed " to vote , only the cost made it prohibitive .
Today , farmers are allowed to farm but the FDA 's seed contamination regulations ( with Monsanto's hand in them easy to see ) have just listed seed cleaning equipment as sources of seed contamination and farmers are no longer allowed to use the equipment they have to clean seed to sell to the public now .
Click here .
The seeds included ?
Those eaten raw ( flax , poppy , sesame ) ; those sprouted ( wheat , alfalfa , beans , greens , broccoli , etc. ) ; those pressed into oils ( corn , soy , sunflower , canola , etc. ) ; those used for animal feed .
Oh , farmers can still clean those seeds but they would have to get equipment the FDA now requires as safe enough - a million to a million and half dollar building and equipment ... for each line of seed .
A farmer with hand made seed cleaning equipment he 's used for 40 years to clean seeds which never made a single person sick , would now need to build 15 buildings if he wishes to raise and sell 15 kinds of seeds .
This corporate influence is criminal and corrupt .
But even putting that aside , the imposition of corporate standards on small farmers is discriminatory .
And intentionally so .
Just as with voting rights , it is meant to deny the civil rights of one group to the advantage of a more powerful one .
A second example .
Once poll taxes were eliminated , racist white people found another means of blocking blacks from voting - literacy tests .
Using the seemingly rational argument that people should be educated enough to vote , they inserted this bar between black people and their full Constitutional right to vote .
Black people were slurred , deemed " too dumb to vote . "
No one , of course , was testing whether the racists were too undemocratic to vote , too cruel , too miseducated , too corrupt , or too ... whatever .
And no one asked whether common sense and decency and a history of being treated unjustly were actually ideal qualifications for voting and literacy was irrelevant and not included in the Constitution .
What mattered was only that one group discriminated against another and denied them their Constitutional rights and using " false measures of value " to do so .

There are a lot of words you could use to describe Tesla chairman ( and co-founder of PayPal and Space X ) Elon Musk : Entrepreneur .
Risk - taker .
Bejillionaire .
Icarus - in - training .
I could go on .
If an article in the February issue of GQ is to be believed , the South African - born Musk is all those things and more .
Most importantly , he is driven , he is young , he is knowledgeable ( at least when it comes to math and science ) , and he is just a tiny bit crazy .
Well , maybe more than a tiny bit .
He is also , as most people of his type are , fairly self - aggrandizing :
“ We ’re all focused on our little things that are of concern to humanity itself .
People think of curing AIDS or cancer as being very important , and they are — within the context of humanity .
But curing all forms of cancer would improve the average life span by only two to three years .
That ’s it . ”
In other words , while eradicating disease is a worthy pursuit , and would extend the lives of individual human beings , my life ’s work is extending the life span of life itself .
But then , you do n't really get VC 's attention by humbly disappearing into the background , now do you ?
Before you click through to that rather lengthy piece , here 's a ( poorly encoded ) clip of Musk in a recent appearance on CNBC , where he basically says , " No , no , Tesla 's totally fine .
We do n't need any bailout support .
Well , not really .
But it would n't hurt . "

Making the Banks Run in the Direction We Want
By : Aaron Datesman
Dave Lindorff had this to say today :
It should be clear at this point that the Goldman cabal burrowed deep inside the Washington apparatus is working not to rescue the U.S. economy , but rather to ensure the survival and enrichment of the big banking establishment , and of course Goldman Sachs .
Well , duh !
But then there ’s this part , where he burrows into my head and splashes my secret thoughts up on the inner tubes :
If you have an account at any national bank , go there tomorrow and take it out .
Transfer it to a local bank in your community .
You 'll get better service , your money will still be just as safe , and you wo n't be propping up institutions that have been stealing the country blind .
I have a little money in an account at Bank of America and will do this TOMORROW !
And .... well , nothing will happen .
I could do this at 10 and then go back to reading the blogs and pondering just how very awful everything either is , or is about to be , at 10:07 .
Bank of America is the world ’s largest financial services firm .
It has more than 6100 retail branches and has received about $ 50 bn in TARP funds , along with an additional $ 118 bn in loan guarantees .
This is outrageous , of course , but it ’s also interesting .
The firm ’s market capitalization is only $ 19 bn .
Now , I ’m not an economist , but looking at those numbers I get the sense that the firm is not really , uh , solvent .
In fact , I think it ’s a brain - eating zombie bank .
So , it ’s an interesting thing about how awful everything is , but I think in the current situation we have a lot more power than we used to have .
Do you have an envelope to write on the back of ?
I ’m guessing it takes at least 500 customers to support a branch .
$ 1000 works for me as an average account balance .
This totals up to $ 3 bn .
What do you say we all send this letter to our Congresspersons ?
Dear Congressperson ,
If it ’s too big to fail , it ’s too big to exist .
The nation ’s largest banks and Wall Street firms have created a tremendous crisis with no accountability for their disgraceful behavior .
Unless the Congress takes immediate action to nationalize and break up the nation ’s largest financial firms , including Bank of America , I will withdraw my consent from the financial system .
On May 5 , 2009 , I plan to close my accounts and withdraw my $ xxxx balance in cash from Bank of America .
This is my right as a citizen and as a depositor .
I encourage the millions of my fellow citizens who also have accounts with BoA to do the same on this date .
Sincerely , etc. cc : Kenneth D Lewis , CEO , Bank of America
Credit to Dave Lindorff ( who is absolutely correct ) , but throwing a fit at the counter of the local branch of an enormous bank is not a stick .
An activist - organized bank run , on the other hand , would be a very powerful weapon .
Could BoA possibly withstand a billion - dollar bank run ?
If anybody thinks that the answer to this question is yes , I would love to know why you think this .
We have the internet to use .
How could we get this done ?

The company , AM2PAT , is the subject of a criminal investigation .
The company ’s president has fled to India .
The company allegedly falsified documents to make it seem as if required sterility tests had been done .
The company ’s “ chief microbiologist ” was a teenage high - school dropout .
The company ’s “ clean room ” was ventilated by an ordinary room fan .
One piece of lab equipment that could detect contamination was broken when investigators visited , and another had been broken for a year .
A 2005 complaint to the FDA claimed that food particles were found in a heparin syringe .
Beginning in 2007 , physicians and clinics began reporting orange specks , wispy debris , and yellow - orange sediment floating in the syringes .
The liquid was described as tan , orange , muddy , and dingy brown .
There ’s a story out of Raleigh , North Carolina about a local company accused of selling tainted syringes filled with heparin or saline .
These syringes have so far been linked to 5 deaths .
Among the revelations in this article from the Raleigh News & Observer
As a teen , “ chief microbiologist ” would have been my dream job .
Unfortunately , I failed to drop out of high school , so I guess I was unqualified .

Government economists must be nice folks .
They ’ve had to break a lot of bad news to us since this recession started over a year ago .
But they ’re nice .
They ’re breaking it to us as gently as possible .
They ask , “ Do you want the bad news first ?
Or the really bad news ? ”
And Wall Street ’s reflex to avoid reality is quick to ask ( and all too willingly accept ) for the bad news .
This allows professional traders and money managers to hold off on giving up hope altogether .
It ’s hope that has kept the market going so far .
Hope for an economic recovery in the second half of 2009 as early as 2010 .
Hope Congress wo n’t see this as an opportunity to “ fix ” everything with a newly hired army of business - stifling bureaucrats .
Hope the good times will return –eventually .
The Meekness of Hope
Of course , hope is n’t an investment strategy .
There are no price - to - hope ratios in which we can use to judge whether this stock is a good buy or that one is better .
But it does n’t matter .
Hope carried the market out of the depths of the credit crunch lows .
Remember , that was when overleveraged hedge funds and traders were forced to sell into a weak market .
Fading hope put a quick end to that rally .
Investors are voluntarily selling out this time around .
But hey , the economists are being nice .
A few weeks ago they broke the bad news to us .
They said the U.S. GDP , the total value of all goods and services produced and consumed in the country , declined at the annual rate of 3.8 % in the last three months of 2008 .
We all knew it seemed a bit optimistic , but hey , they ’re economists and being wrong is acceptable .
They saved the really bad news until yesterday .
About 22 hours ago the government revealed its “ revised ” GDP figures .
A hopeful Wall Street was expecting a decline of 5.4 % for the quarter .
As usual , hopes were dashed when the actual decline came in at the rate of 6.2 % .
“ Oops . ”
The economy declined at the fastest rate since 1982 .
The Dow dropped another 100 points or so on the news .
The Good Side
But here ’s the thing .
As we predicted about six months ago , Wall Street would eventually become completely fixated on the economy .
That ’s how it always is when times get tough .
And there will be no sustainable recovery in the markets until the economy shows some signs of life .
If we wait for the government economists to tell us what ’s going on , we ’ll be months behind the curve .
We ’ll miss the real buying opportunity .
After all , they did n’t even say the recession officially started in November 2007 until almost a year later .
So we ’ve got to find our own way to determine the health of the economy .
If we could , we ’d be months and months ahead of the herd .
And any advantage you can get is extremely valuable in a market like this .
That ’s why I look at the electricity consumption as a real time GDP indicator free from any government economist ’s rounding errors or political influence .
A Trustworthy GDP Indicator
I can cite more than a dozen academic studies which have correlated electricity consumption to GDP / per capita income growth .
They span six continents and the past five decades .
They all arrive at the same conclusion ; there is a strong relationship between GDP growth and electricity consumption .
We ’ve seen how good academic theories work out time and time again ( i.e. derivative hedging models , LTCM , etc. ) .
More importantly , it passes the rational person test .
In other words , it ’s common sense .
An economy that ’s growing is a great thing .
Entrepreneurs are working late , fearful of competition encroaching on their success and of missing an opportunity .
Factories are running at high rates .
They often add additional shifts and stay open all night while they ’re expanding elsewhere .
People go to restaurants to celebrate their efforts and success .
Businessmen fly around the world to cut deals , find partnerships , and get their companies in position to grow .
There ’s nothing better than a vibrant economy .
As you might expect , this all takes a lot of electricity .
The small business who keeps the lights on and heat going late into the evening while everyone ’s putting in some OT to keep up with orders .
Factory machinery running at full power for longer periods will soak up quite a bit more electricity .
And on and on .
You know , it just makes sense and it works in real world applications too .
The Great Fall of China
We ’ve covered the rapid decent of the once - mighty Chinese economy here in the Prosperity Dispatch for months and months .
We did n’t get remotely excited for China ’s $ 586 billion bailout ( there ’s that “ hope ” thing again ) .
We ’ve covered the ongoing crisis hitting China ’s factories over the past six months or so .
By now , it should be no surprise to any of our readers China should be in a recession .
The “ official ” numbers tell a completely different story .
The latest report had China ’s economy growing faster than a 6 % annual rate .
That ’s with exports down 20 % to 30 % and falling .
If you look at the trustworthy GDP indicator , there ’s a much different story .
According to the China Electricity Council ’s latest report :
China will see a continuous power glut in 2009 as the global economic downturn forces factories to scale back output and electricity consumption …
[ China ’s electricity consumption ] dropped 12.88 percent compared with the same period of the previous year .
The power consumption in coastal provinces such as Guangdong and Zhejiang dropped more than 20 percent .
Clearly , there are much bigger problems there than the “ official ” GDP data lead on .
As a result , I still think it ’s a bit too early to be betting big on China .
Great Information is Tough to Find
There ’s an old adage , advice is worth what you pay for it .
Quite frankly , that ’s what makes the electricity consumption / GDP indicator so valuable .
It ’s not easy to find .
You ’re not going to see this data for every country published on some heavily visited econo - data web site .
It ’s too real .
It paints too much of a clear picture .
With the economy in the tank , the last thing a hopeful Wall Street wants is a big dose of reality .
And that ’s what it would get if everyone was looking at each individual country ’s electricity consumption data .
The way things are going , it looks like we ’re on the verge of getting that “ best buying opportunity in 5 lifetimes ” we ’ve been waiting for .
We hoped it would n’t come to that , but again , hope does n’t get you very far when it comes to investing successfully .

Guest : Slate 's Dahlia Lithwick on not returning to SCOTUS ; Also : John Oliver touches on touchscreens ; KY Gov. Matt Bevin 's reelection contest ...
On today 's BradCast : John Oliver touches on America 's voting machine crisis , America goes to the polls again ( using those same , unverifiable touchscreen voting systems ) , and one year after accused sex assaulter Brett Kavanaugh was sworn in as a U.S. Supreme Court Justice , one 20 - year veteran SCOTUS journalist is refusing to return to the Court ... and for very good reason .
[ Audio link to show follows below . ]
First up , as we are now officially --- finally --- less than one year away from the critical 2020 Presidential election , our electronic voting systems in many states are still just as bad and dangerous and vulnerable and unverifiable as they were 15 years ago .
And , in a bunch of states and jurisdictions across the country , they are getting even worse and less verifiable than they were in the 2016 election .
HBO 's John Oliver dipped into the issue on his latest Last Week Tonight on Sunday night and got a lot of stuff right regarding our easily - hacked , oft - failed touchscreen voting systems that have been in use over the past several decades .
Unfortunately , he also left out a whole bunch of stuff regarding the new and equally vulnerable and 100 % unverifiable computer touchscreen Ballot Marking Devices ( BMDs ) which are now being installed and proliferating in states ( many of them key battlegrounds ) from coast to coast before 2020 .
In short , as we detail , Oliver 's report was excellent .... if this was 2009 .
As it is now 2019 , however , his commentary was a bit wanting .
But , we 'll take what we can get and that , of course , is why you have The BradCast .
In related - ish news , a bunch of off - year state and local elections are happening in several states on Tuesday .
Among the noteworthy contests is the gubernatorial race in Kentucky , where the unpopular and very Trumpy Republican Governor Matt Bevin is fighting for his life in a race with Democratic Attorney General Andy Beshear ( son of the Bluegrass State 's former Governor Steve Beshear ) , in what pre-election polls suggest is currently a dead - heat contest .
But , as we detail today , Bevin was down anywhere from 3 to 5 points in pre-election polling during his first run for Governor against then Democratic Attorney General Jack Conway in 2015 .
Nonetheless , as we detailed that year , he somehow ended up winning the race , reportedly , by nearly 9 points in a state which still forces many voters to use the same unverifiable touchscreen voting machines that helped Bevin win in 2015 .
Many of those systems are the same very old , vulnerable and unverifiable ones which Oliver railed against on his HBO piece on Sunday .
Trump is in KY on Monday night to help " drag one of the nation ’s most unpopular governors across the finish line , " as the New York Times describes it today , in what many see as a potential bellwether race ahead of 2020 .
Meanwhile , it has now been just over a year since Brett Kavanaugh was sworn in to his lifetime post as an Associate Justice on the Republicans ' stolen U.S. Supreme Court .
He was seated on the bench almost immediately after Republicans in the U.S. Senate rammed through his nomination --- with the help of a trumped up FBI " investigation " --- late last year despite multiple , credible allegations of sexual assault against Kavanaugh from the time he was in high school and college .
Longtime SCOTUS journalist DAHLIA LITHWICK wrote at Slate last week about why she has not returned to the Court since Kavanaugh was sworn in .
She joins us today to discuss the reasons behind her decision , and why , as she described , she will " not accede to the routinization and normalization of the unprecedented seat stolen from President Back Obama in 2016 " by Mitch McConnell and Republicans , nor from the " unprecedented seating of someone who managed to himself evade the very inquiries and truth - seeking functions that justice is supposed to demand " in Kavanaugh .
" One-quarter of the federal appeals courts , at this moment , three years into the Trump presidency , are Trump nominees .
We 're not just talking about nine justices on the Supreme Court .
We 're talking about the most strategic , systematic takeover of the federal bench that any president has ever effectuated , " she tells me .
" And that is happening day by day , right under our noses .
And those judges are also going to sit for decades .
So it 's not just the Supreme Court . "
It 's a fascinating and important conversation , I think , about not only why none of us should simply " get over it " and " move on " , when it comes to both Kavanaugh and the stolen seat filled by Neil Gorsuch , but also why our nation 's seeming inability ( or even interest ) in assuring accountability for all manner of precedent --- and criminal law --- breaking in recent years has brought the country to the perilous position we now find ourselves in : Trump in the White House , the Supreme Court stolen and federal courts packed with unqualified rubes for life , and SCOTUS on the precipice of deciding a number of enormously momentous issues this session from union rights to reproductive justice .
" It 's what happened when Barack Obama made the decision that we just are not going to re-litigate the CIA torture program , and this very aspirational notion that if we all forgive and forget , we all get to meet in the middle and work toward better outcomes .
It 's kind of Lucy with the football --- it never works out to meeting in the middle and working toward better outcomes .
It just turns out that , yet again , ground has been ceded , " she tells me .
" We 're really bad at this .
The heart wants what it wants , and the heart wants normal .
I think that we keep believing that this erosion , this slow systemic erosion of norms , is somehow normal .
I thought it was a law , it 's not a law .
I thought it was a rule , it 's not a rule , " says Lithwick .
" We did n't did n't used to seat 37 - year - old bloggers who 've never set foot in a court room as a federal judges for life .
And now we do .
There 's no law , there 's just a norm .
What I was trying to get at in the piece is that constantly acceding to this and saying , ' Well , this is what it is now ' --- that there are costs .
There are huge , huge costs to democracy . "
" Our scrutiny , our unwavering , unflinching , I 'm - not - over - it scrutiny does make a difference , " she insists .
" We need to hold the Court to the same unflinching , ' we 're watching you , ' 'we care ' .
That seems like soft power , I understand it 's not optimal , but I think the Court responds .
What they really want is for us to put this on page A27 and get over it .
And that 's our choice , not theirs . "
Lots of important stuff here , as I said .
Ca n't really summarize it well enough here , so please tune in .
Also , Lithwick rings in with some thoughts --- which tie into the broader conversation --- on what she expects from John Roberts '
Supreme Court following today 's ruling by a federal appeals court in Manhattan that Trump 's accounting firm , Mazars USA , must turn over some 8 years of his and his company 's tax and other financial documents to New York state prosecutors and a similar decision by a federal appeals court in D.C. last month that the same firm must also turn over similar records to Congressional investigators in response to yet another lawful subpoena ...

It seems the British have found a way to cope with the global economic crisis .
A survey by the Terrence Higgins Trust , a UK AIDS charity , found that sex is the most popular free activity in the empire , beating out window shopping and going to a museum .
BBC :
As the credit crunch bites , Britons may be turning to sex as a cheap way to pass the time , a charity says .
A YouGov survey of 2,000 adults found sex was the most popular free activity , ahead of window shopping and gossiping .
The Scots were most amorous with 43 % choosing sex over other pastimes , compared with 35 % in South England .

Foster parent who has looked after 80 children struck off ... because a Muslim girl in her care became a Christian
A foster mother has been struck off by a council after a teenage Muslim girl in her care became a Christian .
The carer , who has ten years ’ experience and has looked after more than 80 children , said she was ‘ devastated ’ by the decision .
‘ This is my life , ’ she revealed .
‘ It is not just a job for me .
It is a vocation .
I love what I do .
It is also my entire income .
I am a single carer , so that is all I have to live on . ’
A foster mother is struck off after a 16 - year - old Muslim girl in her care became a Christian
The foster mother said she had recently bought a larger car and had been renting a farmhouse , with a pony in a field , so that she could provide more disadvantaged children with a new life .
‘ That was always my dream and then suddenly , bang , it was gone .
I am now in a one - bedroom flat , ’ she added .
The girl is understood to be back with members of her family , who have not been told of her conversion .
A second girl the woman was fostering has been moved to another carer .
The woman insisted that , although she was a Christian , she had put no pressure on the Muslim girl , who was 16 at the time , to be baptised .
But council officials allegedly accused her of failing to ‘ respect and preserve ’ the child ’s faith and tried to persuade the girl to reconsider her decision .
The carer , who can not be named for legal reasons , is now preparing to take legal action against the council with the support of the girl , now 17 , who also can not be named .
Her case follows the controversy over Caroline Petrie , 45 , the Christian nurse in Somerset suspended without pay in December for offering to pray for an elderly woman patient .
She was reinstated this week .
Yesterday , Christians expressed outrage over the foster carer ’s treatment , saying that it was a basic right for people to be able to change their religion and the woman should be praised , not punished .
Mike Judge , a spokesman for the Christian Institute , a pressure group which is funding her case , said : ‘ I can not imagine that an atheist foster carer would be struck off if a Christian child in her care stopped believing in God .
‘ This is the sort of double standard which Christians are facing in modern Britain .
In recent months , we have seen grandparents , a nurse , adoption agencies , firemen , registrars , elderly care homes and now a foster carer being punished because of the Christian beliefs they hold .
It has got to stop . ’
The carer , a mother - of - two in her 50s , has worked with young children for much of her life and became a foster parent for the local authority in the North of England in 1999 .
In 2007 , she was asked to look after the girl , who had been assaulted by a family member .
She told council officials that she was very happy to support the girl in her religion and culture .
‘ We had a multicultural household and I had no problems helping the young person maintain her faith of birth , ’ she said .
‘ I have always prided myself in being very professional in what I do .
If something works for a young person , whether I agree with it or not , I am happy to support them in that . ’
But the girl , whom the foster mother describes as caring and intelligent , defied expectations by choosing not to wear overtly Muslim clothes or to eat Halal food .
The girl , whose interest in Christianity had begun at school some time before her foster placement , also made it clear that she wanted to go to church .
The carer , an Anglican who attends a local evangelical church , said : ‘ I did initially try to discourage her .
‘ I offered her alternatives .
I offered to find places for her to practise her own religion .
I offered to take her to friends or family .
But she said to me from the word go , “ I am interested and I want to come . ”
She sort of burst in .’
The carer said that the girl ’s social workers were fully aware that she was going to church and had not raised any objections .
The girl had told her auxiliary social worker of her plans to convert before she was baptised in January last year , and the social worker had appeared to give her consent .
‘ At that point the brakes were off , ’ the carer said .
‘ I could n’t have stopped her if I had wanted to .
She saw the baptism as a washing away of the horrible things she had been through and a symbol of a new start . ’
Three months later , however , senior officials complained that they had not been fully informed of the girl ’s intentions to become a Christian .
They said that she should have undergone counselling to ensure that she understood the implications , especially as such conversions are dealt with harshly in some Muslim countries .
The foster carer said , however , that the girl had thought about her decision very carefully and was aware that members of her family might react strongly , so she was adamant that they should not be told .
The carer said that as the auxiliary social worker knew about the baptism , she had not thought it necessary to tell the fostering team as well .
But she received a phone call from the fostering manager who was ‘ incandescent with rage ’ that the baptism had gone ahead .
The carer said : ‘ Up to that point , we had had a good relationship , so I was quite taken aback .
I was very shocked . ’
In April , council officials told the girl that she should not attend any church activity for six months , so that she could reconsider the wisdom of becoming a Christian .
The carer was also instructed to discourage the girl from participating in any Christian activities , even social events .
The council then told the carer there had been a breakdown of trust and in November removed her from the register .
‘ It never occurred to me that they would go that far , ’ she said .
‘ I was concerned that the council seemed to view Christianity in such a negative light .
I wonder whether if it had gone the other way – if one of my Christian young people had decided to embrace another faith – there would have been this level of fuss . ’
She added that the girl has been devastated by the experience .
The carer ’s solicitor Nigel Priestley said : ‘ There is no doubt that the event that provoked the council was the decision by the girl to be baptised .
This girl was 16 and has the right to make this choice , so for the council to react in this way is totally disproportionate .
Even at this late hour , we hope that the council will resolve the issue . ’
A council spokes - man said : ‘ From the details provided , we believe that this information relates to a child who is the subject of a final care order in favour of the council .
In those circumstances , we are unable to pass any comment .
‘ We would never be able to comment on sensitive issues surrounding a child in care .
‘ To do so would be irresponsible and in this particular case may put the child at risk of harm . ’

A new video suggests that Cassiopeia A , the remnant of a supernova that exploded in the Milky Way some 330 years ago , may be channelling its energy into creating high - speed charged particles called cosmic rays .
Advertisement
Daniel Patnaude of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge , Massachusetts , has assembled eight years of observations to create a time - lapse movie showing debris flying outward from the site of the explosion .
The movie has allowed Patnaude to clock the expansion speed at 4900 kilometres per second .
While this is fast by human standards , it falls far short of the expected speed of 6300 km /s based on the estimated energy of the initial explosion .
So where did the missing energy go ?
Patnaude suggests it is being used to magnetically accelerate particles , turning them into high - speed cosmic rays , like those that bombard our planet on a daily basis .
Investigations of the magnetic fields within Cassiopeia A appear to support this conclusion .
The results were presented on Tuesday at the American Astronomical Society meeting in Long Beach , California .
Israel carried out air strikes in January on a convoy moving through Sudan which it believed to be carrying weapons destined for Hamas in Gaza , a US television network report by CBS has said .
Two Sudanese politicians yesterday confirmed that unidentified aircraft had targeted the convoy in a remote desert region on the Red Sea coast .
The outgoing Israeli Prime Minister , Ehud Olmert , appeared to fuel speculation that his country ’s air force was behind the attack , which reportedly killed 39 people , when he said that “ Israel hits every place it can in order to stop terror , near and far ” .
CBS reported that Israeli intelligence had learned of plans to move weapons north through Sudan into Egypt and then smuggle them into the Gaza Strip to Hamas .
The report said that those killed were manning the 17 - vehicle convoy , although a number of civilians had also been injured in the attack , which occurred in the same month as Israel ’s offensive in Gaza .
While Israeli defence officials had earlier appeared to pour cold water on the report , Mark Regev , the spokesman for Mr Olmert , would only say that it was not Israel ’s practice “ to respond to these sort of allegations ” .
Interdiction of the convoy would certainly chime with Israeli intelligence warnings in the past that weapons destined for Hamas in Gaza were being shipped from Iran through the Persian Gulf and on to Sudan .

I ’m going to pick on a post that I saw on the forum recently , “ Root kits for . NET framework been found ” [ sic ] .
Now , I believe this person was just doing due diligence and reporting something they thought might honestly be important .
So , “ sharpy ” ( if that is your real name ! ) , this is not meant as a dig on you .
The post points to another forum discussion at dslreports.com , which then has some other links I ’ll let you explore yourself .
In short , the author of some paper or exploit is claiming they have hacked the .NET Framework such that they can bypass strong - name validation , or replace code in mscorlib.dll , etc .
I ’ll publish the first line of the first reply to the post on dslreports :
“ The ‘ exploit ’ starts with the modification of a framework dll ( assembly ) from outside the runtime using administrative privileges . ”
Spot the refutal ?
I put it in bold 🙂
It ’s like Raymond Chen has blogged about on at least one occasion :
“ Surprisingly , it is not a security vulnerability that administrators can add other users to the Administrators group . ”
Here ’s a pop quiz .
If you have administrator access to someone else ’s machine , which of the following would you do ?
Format the hard drive .
Steal data , then format the hard drive .
Display a dialog box saying , “ Gotcha ! ” , and then format the hard drive .
Decompile mscorlib.dll , inject extra code into the IL for the Assembly .
Load ( ) method , recompile the new IL into a new mscorlib.dll , replace the existing mscorlb.dll with your hacked version , edit the system configuration to bypass verification , remove the optimized “ NGEN ” version of mscorlib.dll , delete the pertinent log entries to cover your tracks , and then wait an undetermined amount of time to see that someone launching Paint.
NET or their NVIDIA Control Panel gets a formatted hard drive instead .

I do n’t know about you , but I ’d probably just go with # 1 or # 3 .
I have all the data I need already , thankyouverymuch .
No need to take a graduate course in compilers in order to do the job via # 4 .
Everything being done in # 4 is possible for someone with administrator privilege .
They ’re only doing what they already have access to do .
However , if a non-administrator can do this , then it ’s an elevation of privilege issue .
If it ’s trivial to trick or mislead an administrator into doing it , then it could be called an “ admin attack ” .
But all this is a discussion for another time .
So in conclusion , I would n’t be worried about this .
The moment you see something about an attack or exploit requiring administrator privilege , or in some cases even just physical access , feel free to relax .
( After all , if you have physical access to the computer , just hit the reset button and install Linux , right ? )

Update : I posted up a cleaner version of this to the CouchDB wiki at http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/View_Snippets
So .
I need to compute the standard deviation .
I did n’t trust jchris ’ couchdb reduce example , so I decided to dig through google and find ( again ) the accepted on - line way to compute standard deviation ( and other moments ) .
All in all a pretty interesting search .
There is a great , free programming book available from MIT .
All about lists .
That did n’t help .
Then I found the above referenced example in the couchdb mailing lists , as well as another that pointed to a java library .
I looked at that , and noted that it cited Knuth ’s art of computer programming .
So that was good .
Then I did another google search and eventually looked at the Wikipedia entry ( which was typically pretty sloppy ) but which atypically had a decent reference or two .
Both of those references were on - line too , so I eventually worked up two algorithms to compute the second moment .
I did two , because the output should match , no ? and it does .
So they must be correct !
( Good old CRA data management strategies coming into play there ) .
First the raw reduce code , cut from the Futon window :

And there you have it .
The input as you might be able to tell from the code , is an object with “ risk ” as the pertinent bit of information getting reduce .
The above code is very difficult to read , but I wanted to get it up now in case I never get back to it .
My goal is to split the code into two , and time them both on really large sets of data , then use the best one and delete the other .
Another reason to get it up somewhere .
I like the non-Knuth version , even though it is pretty tortured in its use of stacks and so on , because the authors go on at length about how much better it is to use their pairwise algorithm , both numerically and from a storage point of view .
Also it lends itself to tacking on the other code for computing higher order moments .
But I think I will keep the min/max stuff from the java code , as it could be useful .
Oh , to close a loophole , the reason I did n’t trust the code from the couchdb - reduce - example is that I did n’t see immediately what I was looking for .
On closer inspection , it probably does the same thing as my code .
Hmm , yes , for completeness , I am going to plug in this third way and check if it give the same results .
And indeed it does :
{ " S " : 1276.8988123975391 , " Sum " : 1257.4497350063907 , " M " : 955 , " min " : 0.033031734767263086 , " max " : 6.011336961717487 , " mean " : 1.3167012932004087 , " M2 " : 1276.898812397539 , " variance_n " : 1.3370668192644386 , " variance_nOtherWay " : 1.3370668192644388 , " mean_OtherWay " : 1.3167012932004092 , " n " : 955 , " stdDeviation " : 1.1563160550923948 , " count " : 955 , " total " : 1257.4497350063905 , " sqrTotal " : 2932.5845046149643}
As long as you believe that sqrt( 1.3370668192644386 ) is about 1.1563160550923948 .
Oh , and on rereading the rationale behind the Chan , Golub , and LeVeque paper they state :
This problem is sometimes avoided by use of the following textbook algorithm , so called because , unfortunately , it is often suggested in statistical textbooks :
S = Sum( x ** 2 ) – ( 1/N ) ( Sum( x ) ) **2
[ [ the equation used in the github example ] ]
This rearrangement allows S to be computed with only one pass through the data , but the computation may be numerically unstable and should almost never be used in practice .
This instability is particularly troublesome when S is very small .
For the record , I did not notice any problems so far on my test data , but I certainly have run into numerical stability problems in other cases on the more general data set , so I will probably stick with the other algorithms .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. budget deficit will swell to a record $ 1.186 trillion in fiscal 2009 , congressional forecasters said on Wednesday , the result of an economic recession that has cut tax receipts and caused massive government bailouts of banks and automakers .

The out - of - control deficit picture by the Congressional Budget Office illustrates the daunting economic challenges President - elect Barack Obama faces when he takes office on January 20 .
But on Thursday , Obama will deliver a speech on the economy in which he will lay out his case for even more short - term deficit spending , possibly $ 775 billion or more over two years , to help heal the sick economy .
CBO also said the budget deficit could fall to $ 703 billion in the 2010 fiscal year which begins October 1 , 2009 , as the U.S. recession begins easing .
The actual budget gaps for both years may be significantly greater as Washington prepares to pass the gigantic economic stimulus bill by mid-February .
The CBO report shattered President George W. Bush ’s pledge that the government would balance its budget by 2012 .
Instead , CBO sees significant deficits at least through 2019 .
The recession , which began in December 2007 , has brought major job losses and slashed consumer spending and tax revenues .
Unhappy and anxious voters elected Obama to the White House and gave Democrats larger majorities in Congress .
“ This is n’t your run - of - the - mill recession , ” CBO Acting Director Robert Sunshine told reporters .
He said it might be the longest downturn since World War II .
CBO projected the U.S. economy will shrink 2.2 percent in 2009 , the deepest for any calendar year since an 11 percent decline in 1946 , before growing a modest 1.5 percent in 2010 .
Unemployment was forecast to rise to an average of 8.3 percent this year and 9 percent in 2010 .
But Sunshine said there was unusual uncertainty with the forecasts .
Obama has said he expects deficits around $ 1 trillion for years , forcing tough budget choices .
But on Wednesday he said his stimulus plan would not be as big as some have projected .
“ GRIM EPITAPH ”
While trying to revive the economy , Obama also faces a longer - term problem of trying to control the rapid growth in the cost of federal retiree and health benefits for an aging population .
Politicians have been putting off these tough decisions for years .
Obama said he was mindful that the stimulus package would add to the near - term deficits but said it was needed because of the “ dire ” condition of the economy .
Signaling that he intends to stress fiscal responsibility , Obama on Wednesday named former Treasury official Nancy Killefer to scour the budget for wasteful spending items .
Rep . Paul Ryan of Wisconsin , the senior Republican on the House Budget Committee , warned that if the stimulus measure establishes permanent new spending programs , trillion dollar deficits would never go away .
The projected deficits dwarf last year ’s $ 455 billion -- the current record .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
House Budget Committee Chairman John Spratt , a South Carolina Democrat , said the new CBO deficit forecast represented “ a grim epitaph for the Bush administration , ” which inherited a surplus in 2001 .
In coming months , Congress will be asked to approve tens of billions of dollars for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan which have so far cost $ 857 billion , further adding to the deficit .
This year ’s deficit also swelled in part because of a $ 240 billion rescue of mortgaging financing companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and a tax rebate , part of a 2008 stimulus package which will cost $ 168 billion over two years .
The Bush administration has loaned hundreds of billions of dollars to rescue financial institutions from risky real estate investments that went sour .
Domestic automakers also are getting assistance from Washington .
The bailouts could cost the government $ 184 billion this year and $ 5 billion next year , the CBO projected .
So far , the Treasury Department has spent about half of the $ 700 billion authorized by Congress .
CBO also estimated deficits over the next five years will total $ 1.972 trillion .
When Bush took office , total U.S. debt was $ 5.7 trillion .
It now stands at more than $ 10.6 trillion because of increased government spending , tax cuts and the recession .
TRENTON , N.J. , Feb. 5 ( UPI ) --
A union has the right to display an inflatable balloon in the shape of a rat during protests , the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled Thursday .
The court found that an ordinance in Lawrence , N.J. , banning inflatable signs is n't content - neutral because it allows businesses to use them for " grand openings . "

The case began in 2005 when Local 269 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers protested outside Gold 's Gym because of a dispute with a contractor working there .
The union took a 10 - foot inflatable rat to the demonstration .
A union official , Wayne DeAngelo , was given a summons when he refused to obey a police officer who told him to deflate the balloon .
DeAngelo lost in municipal court .
Superior Court and the Appellate Division before winning in the Supreme Court .
Lower courts found that the ordinance has a legitimate purpose -- keeping Lawrence safe and beautiful .
The high court disagreed because Lawrence allows temporary signs including " grand opening " balloons and signs for yard sales .
The Russian foreign minister says arms reduction with the US is a top priority The US and Russia say they will try to clinch a new strategic arms reduction treaty ( Start ) by the end of 2009 .
" This is of the highest priority , " US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said , after talks in Geneva with her Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov .
In turn , Mr Lavrov described the current Start treaty - due to expire by 5 December - as " obsolete " .
Mrs Clinton earlier said Washington was keen to re-launch its ties with Moscow to end months of cool relations .
Start 1 limited the deployment of nuclear warheads to 6,000 per side , along with 1,600 missiles and bombers .
It was followed by Start 2 which brought warheads down to 3,500 .
Mrs Clinton and Mr Lavrov said the two sides had agreed to work together on a number of issues of common and world interest , including Afghanistan , the Middle East and North Korea .
There was a rather confrontational approach towards Russia in the prior [ US ] administration

Necessity pushes two sides closer Pressing the US - Russia reset button
But the two diplomats admitted that differences in their positions remained .
Mrs Clinton said the relationship between the two countries needed " more trust , predictability and progress " .
After the talks , Mr Lavrov later told the 65 - nation UN Conference on Disarmament in Geneva : " The right moment has come , for the first time since the end of the Cold War , for making real progress in resuming the global disarmament process on a broad agenda . "
The BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva says agreement on the need for a new deal to cut warheads and delivery systems by the end of this year is the easiest disarmament move the two sides can make at this point .
Other more divisive issues remain , says our correspondent , such as Washington 's plan for a missile defence shield in Eastern Europe - Moscow strongly objects to this .

But , Sergei Lavrov said , talks are continuing on this too , and compromise might be possible .
Our correspondent says it is at least a sign the UN disarmament process , in stalemate for so long , is now moving again , amid warming relations between Moscow and Washington .
On Thursday , Nato agreed to resume high - level contacts with Russia , especially regarding co-operation over the Nato mission in Afghanistan .
Relations between the US and Russia have deteriorated in recent years over Russia 's role in the war in Georgia , American support for the entry of Georgia and Ukraine to Nato , and the planned US missile shield based in central Europe .

We want to make the process of building , testing , and deploying applications on Amazon EC2 as simple and efficient as possible .
Modern web applications typically run in clustered environments comprised of one or more servers .
Unfortunately , setting up a cluster can involve locating , connecting , configuring and maintaining a significant amount of hardware .
Once this has been done , keeping the operating system , middleware , and application code current and consistent across each server can add inefficiency and tedium to the development process .
In recent years , Amazon Web Services has helped to ease much of this burden , trivializing the process of acquiring , customizing , and running server instances on demand .
Also , in the last couple of years , the Eclipse IDE ( Integrated Development Environment ) has become very popular among developers .
The modular nature of the Eclipse architecture opens the door to customization , extension , and continuous refinement via plug-ins ( full directory here ) .
Today , we are introducing the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse .
This free , open source plugin for the Eclipse IDE makes it easier and more efficient for you to develop , deploy , and debug Java applications on top of AWS .
In fact , you can design an entire AWS - hosted Tomcat - based cluster from within Eclipse .
You can design your cluster , specifying the number of EC2 instances and the instance type to run .
You can select and even create security groups and keypairs and can associate an Elastic IP address with each instance .
The plugin will manage your cluster , starting up instances as needed and then keeping them alive as you develop , deploy , and debug .
If you start your application in Debug mode , you can set remote breakpoints , inspect variables or stack frames , and even single - step through the remote code .
You can see all of this great functionality in action here .
This is a first step for us , and we anticipate supporting additional languages and application servers ( e.g. Glassfish , JBoss , WebSphere , and WebLogic ) over time .
As is the case with all of our services , customer input and feedback will help to shape the direction of the plugin .
As I noted before , the new AWS Toolkit for Eclipse is free and you can download it now .
You can contribute your own enhancements to the toolkit by joining the SourceForge project .

In an interview with the Herald this week from Los Angeles , Mr Brewer , who co-founded InterMix Media , which sold MySpace to News Corp , said MySpace would still grow strongly but not as fast as Facebook .
But Mr Brewer , who has left the company to set up an online ad network that deals with both companies , also warned that Facebook is likely to be usurped as the king of social networking sites within two years by another entrant which will most likely pop up with better user functionality for mobile phones .
" There 's a fundamental shift going on , " Mr Brewer said .
" Both sites are ... different .
We built MySpace for people to find and connect with people they do n't know .
Facebook is ... built around connecting with people you already know .
" Clearly , the world eagerly embraced MySpace , but as the average person has adopted social networks , where they come to first is making connections with the people they already know .
" Facebook has done an excellent job of capitalising on that . "
Australian figures from Nielsen Online support Mr Brewer 's view .
In September 2007 , MySpace boasted nearly double the number of users of Facebook , but within a year MySpace users had declined by 400,000 while Facebook had signed up an astounding 2 million new users .
As of December last year - the latest figures available from Nielsen - Facebook had 4.6 million users compared with 2.3 million for MySpace .
While the winner in the race for user numbers appears to be clear , making money from them is not - a point made by Rupert Murdoch this week .
He said there had been a " slight downturn " in revenue at MySpace .
According to Mr Brewer , MySpace 's revenue decline is partly linked to News Corp and MySpace being outplayed by Facebook in opening up applications , or " widgets " , to outside developers on a revenue share model .
Facebook had about 80,000 developers scrambling to launch the next hot application to tickle Facebook users , while MySpace had been slower to move , Mr Brewer said .
About 30 per cent of Facebook 's total user activity is in the applications area and it has helped break down advertiser resistance to social networking sites .
Mr Brewer said widget zones are considered a safe haven by advertisers because there is little risk of having their ad placed next to unsavoury pictures , conversations and comments .
It is also where Mr Brewer 's new project , an online advertising company called AdKnowledge , happens to play - his company serves ads into these areas of MySpace and Facebook 14 billion times a month .
Prolific advertisers on social networking sites include movie studios .
Universal Pictures , which uses Facebook and MySpace , might pay $ 2 every time a trailer is viewed .
Mr Brewer said the real revenue potential for social networking sites was in their ability to trigger word - of - mouth marketing .
" We see when we roll out a movie promotion , 60 - 70 per cent of the movie trailer views are coming from people who saw their friends watch the same thing , " Mr Brewer said .
However , Mr Brewer said that in the end , social networking sites would have to accept that they would not monetise their audiences through advertising in the same way as a typical online publisher .
Zinc Alloy said : expect it to be Morrissey 's lowest charting single since Satan Rejected My Soul .
I hope I 'm wrong of course , it deserves to do well , but I 'll be surprised if it makes the top 20 .
Far better choice of single than Black Cloud but I do n't imagine it getting much in the way of airplay or videoplay ( no change there really ) and Click to expand ...
Sad to say I agree .
While I would love to think otherwise , I do n't think this is the kind of song that 'll get on the radio .
' Satan ... ' actually had a real hook and in a lot of ways is a much more likely playlist song than SISMS .
It depends what we think Moz is looking for with a single - a ) A statement of intent ' f *** you and your chart positions , this is art ' kind of single where the aim is to simply release your strongest work and accept that perhaps you will receive limited exposure and therefore get a much lower chart position but who remembers chart positions anyway ? b )
Something that comes with more or less a guarantee of heavy airplay and invitations to perform said song on TV shows .
Perhaps not your artistic peak but the aim of the single is n't to showcase that , it 's simply to generate sales for the album .
I would love to think he'd go for ' a ' but I think we all know he'd be going with option ' b ' .
If that 's true then I 'm not sure that SISMS would give the record the extra exposure he'd like .
Do n't get me wrong , as I said before I do prefer the idea of this as a single to the dismal lump of gruel that is Black Cloud but , I dunno - still does n't inspire excitement .
That said ... does anyone really think there are anymore singles left on YoR ?
Not 'oooh I 'd love it if ( insert song X ) was a single ' but actually songs that fit the general criteria of ' A Morrissey Single These Days ' .
Apologies for the long post .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Dr. Daniel Carlat knows all too well how easy it is for doctors to be seduced by drug industry money .
In 2002 , he earned $ 30,000 in speaking fees to promote Wyeth ’s antidepressant Effexor XR to fellow doctors .
“ I quit doing it because I felt I was beginning to push some ethical boundaries in terms of what I was saying and what I was not saying , ” said Carlat , a psychiatry professor at Tufts University in Boston who believes doctors need to cut their financial ties with drug companies .
“ My own story was really nothing special , ” he said in a telephone interview .
“ I made $ 30,000 for the year , which is less than some of these doctors make in a weekend . ”
Carlat and other psychiatrists have been studying the issue and have proposed that the American Psychiatric Association cut back on medical education seminars funded by drug companies .
Dr. Nada Stotland , president of the group that represents 38,000 doctors , said the proposal is one of several the association ’s board will take up next month to address concerns that psychiatrists have become too cozy with drugmakers .
The APA and some prominent psychiatrists have been targeted in a probe by Iowa Republican Senator Charles Grassley .
He has faulted several noted child psychiatrists , including Dr. Joseph Biederman of Harvard University in Boston , for failing to disclose hefty payments from drug companies .
Psychiatric drugs represent billions of dollars in global sales , with Wyeth ’s Effexor alone generating sales of $ 4 billion last year .
Several drugmakers last month stopped passing out pens and other items as part of a set of voluntary ethics guidelines , but getting U.S. doctors to give up free medical education , often at fancy resorts , will be a harder sell .
“ Most people see the ban on trinkets as being a small step in the right direction but not really the major source of worry or concern , ” said Carlat , editor of The Carlat Psychiatry Report , a continuing medical education publication supported by subscriptions alone .
“ I think much more important is the fact that companies are paying for legitimacy in different ways by hiring doctors to give talks and hiring companies to put on continuing medical education , ” he said .
“ As long as that continues , it is really hard to see that medical practice wo n’t continue to be biased toward always prescribing the newest and most expensive drugs , even when we do n’t have much clinical experience with them . ”
‘ INTEGRITY OF INFORMATION ’
The drugmakers ’ new ethics guidelines do specify that industry - funded seminars are intended to cover “ a full range of treatment options , and not to promote a certain medicine . ”
And they recommend that medical education grants should not come from a company ’s marketing budget .
“ Doctors rely on accurate and appropriate information about new medicines in order to provide the best possible care to patients , ” David Norton , a Johnson & Johnson executive who worked on the new code , said in a statement announcing the changes .
“ We take this responsibility seriously and are constantly re-examining ways we can enhance these essential company - physician interactions and reinforce the integrity of information about our medicines . ”
Still , many doctors think the model of drug company money paying to educate doctors is patently flawed .
“ It is self - evidently absurd to look to a company for information about a product it makes , ” Dr. Marcia Angell of Harvard Medical School and former editor of the New England Journal of Medicine , said in a telephone interview .
“ Why ca n’t doctors , who are among the most privileged members of society , pay for their own continuing medical education ? ”
Angell said .
“ Why have they abdicated that responsibility to the companies who make drugs ? ”
Stotland has heard a range of opinions on whether to ban industry - sponsored talks but she said the APA board will likely cut out at least some of the seminars during their meetings .
“ There are still those who feel strongly that they can hear things but it does n’t influence their practice , ” she said .
“ But the evidence points the other way . ”
Researcher Karl Kruszelnicki said : " The reason it is usually blue is that we mostly wear blue or grey trousers , often jeans , and when these rub against the body , the fibres often end up finding their way to the navel . "
Irish bankers made a mistake by lending too much money to small group of customers and business sectors , a senior banking executive told a function in Dublin last night .
Robert Gallagher , chief executive of Ulster Bank Corporate Markets , said healthy banks were “ inextricably linked ” to the health of an economy and admitted “ there is no question that we bankers have made mistakes ” .
“ We have lent too much money relative to our deposit base [ and ] we filled that gap in the wholesale markets on a short - term basis , ” he said .
These mistakes included a concentration of “ risk exposure ” to certain people and markets and issuing loans based on “ incomplete information ” .
Speaking at a Dublin Chamber of Commerce dinner Mr Gallagher said while the global credit crisis had exacerbated the problems facing the Irish financial sector , “ those fundamental errors that I identified existed irrespective of the [ global ] current crisis ” .
Ulster Bank , owned by Royal Bank of Scotland , is among the banks that have made high - profile loans to property developers .
It loaned much of the €379 million Seán Dunne ’s Mountbrook Homes used to buy the Jurys site in Dublin ’s Ballsbridge in 2005 and , along with Bank of Ireland , Ulster Bank was owed up to € 150 million by Taggart Holdings when it was given court protection from its creditors in October .
Addressing an audience of almost 300 business people and politicians , including Taoiseach Brian Cowen , Mr Gallagher said banks had to rebuild public confidence in them .
“ Banks have to become organisations that you are happy to put money on deposit with ” .
Calling for a new relationship with customers , Mr Gallagher said banks had to provide a “ robust challenge ” to business propositions and warn of potential risks .
But once a decision was made to invest banks had to quickly provide support so that viable businesses could “ flourish , grow and recruit ” , he said .
“ Equally customers now need to get back to sharing information with their banks on an accurate , timely and complete manner so that together both parties understand how the business is going ” .
It was impossible to have healthy companies without healthy banks , he added .
Following a series of bank nationalisations in the US , Europe and of Anglo Irish Bank in Ireland , Mr Gallagher used the analogy of a marriage to describe the relationship between banks and governments .
He said the relationship , in all countries including Ireland , has gone from " occasional arguments , people in different rooms with different agendas " to a shared view that a " healthy banking system is essential for a healthy economy " .
Mr Gallagher was speaking as the Government continues to fine - tune its proposals for the recapitalisation of the State ’s two biggest banks which could see capital of € 7 billion injected into Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland .
In August the Ulster Bank Group said its bad debts rose 43 per cent to € 74 million due primarily to loan losses to the commercial and property sector .
This is equal to 0.23 per cent of its overall loan book and the bank expects this to rise .
Pirate Bay spokesperson Peter Sunde Kolmisoppi took the stand today in Sweden as The Pirate Bay 's trial entered its fifth day , and he made a startling claim : in his own survey , 80 percent of the torrents on the site pointed to material that was legal to share online .
In previous days , prosecutor Hakan Roswall and media industry lawyers pressed the defendants on whether they were aware that the site contained links to copyrighted material ; the answer from Fredrik Neij was " yes , " but only because content owners continually sent letters to The Pirate Bay asking them to remove links to certain materials .
Friday , Kolmisoppi revealed that he had looked more directly into the issue by performing a survey on 1,000 random torrents from the site .
Along with some workers in chat rooms , Kolmisoppi tried to figure out how much of this material appeared to infringe copyright — though they apparently did so without downloading any of it .
The result ?
70 to 80 percent of the material was deemed to be legal for sharing , and Kolmisoppi claimed that there was actually a larger proportion of infringing material on YouTube than on The Pirate Bay .
( Read the excellent Twitter translation of the trial for more details from the testimony . )
The testimony fits with repeated defense claims that the site , despite its name , is really just a tool with plenty of legal uses .
Infringement can be addressed by going after end -users , not the tool providers .
( Attempts by the music industry to do just this across the US and Europe were not exactly embraced by the " tool makers , " however . )
70 to 80 percent of the material was deemed to be legal for sharing , and Kolmisoppi claimed that there was actually a larger proportion of infringing material on YouTube than on The Pirate Bay .
Today 's trial was also marked by a bizarre bit of geek speak as prosecutor Hakan Roswall ( attempted to ) pull out his geek card .
TorrentFreak has the translation :
" When did you meet [ fellow defendant Gottfrid ] for the first time IRL ? " asked the Prosecutor .
" We do not use the expression IRL , " said Peter , " we use AFK . "
" IRL ? " questioned the judge .
" In Real Life , " the Prosecutor explained to the judge .
" We do not use that expression , " Peter noted .
" Everything is in real life .
We use AFK — Away From Keyboard . "
" Well , " said Roswall .
" It seems I am a little bit out of date . "
Music industry lawyer Peter Danowsky also had a chance to grill Kolmisoppi and began questioning him about various speeches and newspaper articles that had not previously been entered into evidence .
Defense lawyers objected to the introduction of new evidence , and after a court recess , Danowsky had to turn over all documents he planned to use in the trial for photocopying .
Some of the questions , which involved Kolmisoppi's own views about copyright , were greeted with angry retorts about whether the trial was about alleged illegal activities or political viewpoints .
Kolmisoppi followed these up with a Twitter post .
" That was annoying , " he wrote .
" Now it 's certain this #spectrial is political .
Anyone hear a question that was not based on ideology ? "
To shake off his annoyance , Kolmisoppi and The Pirate Bay gang are throwing a party tonight for 200 people .
Not apparently worn out from his work on the stand today , Kolmisoppi will be making an appearance at 1am .
PWNING ROSWALL
While the party has nothing to do with the legal issues , it did prompt one of the administrators to write about the decentralized model of decision - making and activity that characterizes the Bay — and has proved so vexing to a prosecution intent on drawing up some kind of organized hierarchy .
In the post , one " Johan Allgoth " explained that people choose roles to fill that sound interesting : " Quite often these roles are abandoned .
The network then reorganizes til someone is filling the role again , or , the role is disregarded by all nodes and that role dies out .
This could happen to the party tonight , but that wo n't be the case .
A party is ohh so nice .
" This is one of hundreds of examples of our management .
It is how we have been operating since the very start .
People have a hard time grasping it .
They ask us ;
Who ’s in charge ?
Who are you representing ?
What is your goal ?
What is your agenda ?
Why ?
When ?
How ?
These questions are wrongly posed and I am afraid I cant give you the right ones , that ’s up to scholars later ...
" There is no formal organisation .
Only work with joy and no to full accountability .
This is how we PWN U ROSWALL .
The work that is being produced by the peers of the Spectrial is probably ' worth ' six - seven figures .
Thing is one could never buy it .
It 's a brave new world here , we are making a huge experiment . "
While the " PWN U ROSWALL " bit is more than a little juvenile , there 's something appealing about this model .
" Work with joy " sounds like a pretty fair description of what people want out of their jobs , exactly the opposite of what W.H. Auden described in the lines :
As an unimportant clerk
Writes I DO NOT LIKE MY WORK
On a pink official form .
But is the work in question legal ?
That 's what the professional judge and three lay judges overseeing the trial will have to decide in the next two weeks .

Legal scholars , the blogopshere and the twitterati have been scratching their heads for a week following the Obama administration 's assertion that it might " withdraw " ( . pdf ) classified documents at the center of a closely watched spy case .
Some are wondering whether the feds will use storm - trooper - like tactics to physically remove the data from the case .
Others suggest the Obama administration 's threats portend a constitutional showdown between the judicial and executive branches .
Yet strangely enough , the closest legal analogy seemingly pertains to the 1990s litigation surrounding Area 51 , the once - secret military waste dump in the Nevada desert .
The spy lawsuit tests whether a U.S. president may bypass Congress , as President George W. Bush did , and establish a program of eavesdropping on Americans without warrants .
Bush acknowledged the spy program in 2005 , and Congress ratified it in July .
The classified data the administration is threatening to withdraw from the spy case shows that the U.S. government eavesdropped without warrants on the 2004 telephone conversations of two lawyers for a now defunct Saudi charity called the al - Haramain Islamic Foundation that the United States had designated as a terror group .
Without the classified documents , the aggrieved lawyers cannot establish a legal basis to earn them a day in court .
The eavesdropping evidence in the al - Haramain case came to light after the Treasury Department accidentally disclosed it to the plaintiffs in the case .
The evidence , which the Bush administration and Obama administration have declared a state secret , has never been made public .
The judge in the case , Vaughn Walker of the U.S. District Court in San Francisco , said its admission to the case does not mean it would become a public document .
Last week , a federal appeals court sided with Walker 's January 5 order .
Yet , would the Obama administration take a Gestapo - like approach and physically remove the documents without the blessing of the court , as many lawyers and non-lawyers alike have suggested ?
It 's not completely without precedent , and the government could easily block the judge from accessing the documents .
That 's because the al - Haramain material remains locked under the control of the Obama administration 's Litigation Security Section of the Justice Department , according to the record ( . pdf ) in the case .
And days ago , the government acknowledged that , in 2005 , it purposely destroyed 92 videotapes ( .pdf ) to cover up evidence of mistreatment of U.S. terror suspects – evidence the American Civil Liberties Union was trying to bring to light in a New York federal court lawsuit against the Defense Department .
" How paranoid do you want to get ?
It 's totally paranoid to say the government would destroy evidence , but look at what just happened with the CIA , " said John Strait , a Seattle University constitutional scholar and expert on the Patriot Act .
" The thrust of the Obama administration 's argument in al - Haramain is the executive branch controls access to any information that falls within the state - secrets exemption .
Therefore , they can do anything they want to pull it out of the case .
What they 're saying is they get to decide as the executive branch and the court cannot interfere . "
The Justice Department declined comment .
The state - secrets defense was first recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court in a McCarthy - era lawsuit in 1953 , and has been increasingly and successfully invoked by federal lawyers seeking to shield the government from court scrutiny .
Generally , lawsuits in which national - security information may be divulged are usually tossed by judges at the request of the government –- often by judges who never reviewed any classified data .
Walker is believed to be the only judge not to acquiesce to the government 's invocation of the privilege .
The Bush administration invoked the privilege at least 39 times whereas all other administrations have done so about 16 times .
In the al - Haramain case , the flames of storm - trooping paranoia began whipping about the morning after the Obama administration told Walker on Feb. 27 that it was considering to " withdraw that information from submission to the court and use in this case . "
Jon Eisenberg , the California lawyer for the two attorneys in the case , sent out e-mails to those following the lawsuit , saying :
That 's just astounding !
It 's a not - so - thinly - veiled threat to send Executive Branch authorities ( the FBI ? the Army ? ) to Judge Walker 's chambers to seize the classified material from his files !
In my view , that would be an unprecedented violation of the constitutional separation of powers .
I doubt anything like it has happened in the history of this country .
In an interview , Eisenberg said he read the administration 's words " to mean they are going to take back the documents . "
Douglas Kmiec , a Pepperdine School of Law constitutional scholar and President Ronald Reagan 's chief attorney under the Office of Legal Counsel , said he has never heard of a lawsuit in which evidence ruled admissible was simply pulled from a case by the government .
" To say there is a body of law that gives good , certain and sufficient guidance on this is to indulge a fabrication , " Kmiec said .
" The state secrets privilege is as large as the universe at the moment .
It 's in great need of study and re-examination for purposes of anchoring genuine claims of national security . "
Jonathan Turley , a George Washington University legal scholar , agrees with Kmiec .
" I 've never heard of a case where the government withdrew a document considered relevant without the court 's permission . "
Such a proposition , he said , " is admittedly a gray area . "
Turley , meanwhile , is trying to acquire classified data to learn whether his client , Ali al - Timimi , an Islamic cleric convicted of supporting terror , was illegally spied upon in the United States as part of a bid to win a new trial .
Citing a gag order , Turley declined to discuss the al - Timimi case .
But Turley said litigation in the 1990s he was involved in over Area 51 might provide limited legal guidance in the al - Haramain case .
" We had a huge fight over a manual we submitted to the court to prove the existence and presence of hazardous waste , " Turley said .
" After we submitted it , the government classified it and we were prevented from using it . "
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , he said , " upheld their right to classify the document . "
Despite the storm trooper fantasy , Threat Level suspects the Supreme Court is likely to intervene and resolve the dispute .
All of which means a president 's power to bypass Congress and secretly eavesdrop on Americans without warrants remains , admittedly , a gray area .

Four architecture offices , BIG ( Copenhagen ) , INABA ( Los Angeles ) , MAD ( Beijing ) , and Mass Studies ( Seoul ) have proposed an urban plan for Ansan , South Korea which will be exhibited at the Gyeonggi Museum of Modern Art in Ansan City beginning 17 December 2008 .
The joint project by the four firms uses versatile architectural forms that change in size and use .
The principals of the four offices , Bjarke Ingels , Jeffrey Inaba , Yansong Ma , and Minsuk Cho reinterpret the term ‘ economies of scale ' to mean the value of a single architectural form that functions at several scales .
The works are adaptable enough so that the same form can be enlarged or shrunk and still function as a building .
Given today 's economic instability , the architects propose an architecture that can be sized to accommodate changes in available funding .
The forms have been developed so that if a project 's investment capital decreases , it can be scaled down ; alternatively , if greater financing becomes available , the same form can be scaled up .
These firms believe architecture does not have to be inhabitable and in tune with the human scale at just one size ; it can be conceived with greater utility in mind so that the form can be enjoyed even when reduced or increased by 40 , 50 , or 60 percent .

Como Bluff dinosaur grave yard , 1934
To the west of Rock River and to the east of Medicine Bow lies Como Bluff .
In the popular mind , Wyoming may be associated with Indian Wars , Range Wars , and Sheep Wars .
Yet the Territory and Como Bluff was at the center of another war which gripped the public 's attention during the last third of the 19th Century , a war which involved Indians , F. V. Hayden , John Wesley Powell , Yale University 's Peabody Museum , the Philadelphia Acadamy of Natural Sciences , and the Smithsonian .
Indeed , echoes of that war continue to reverberate today -- " The Bone Wars . "
North Slope , Como Bluff dinosaur grave yard , 1934
In the 1860 's paleontologists rarely collected their own specimens .
It was common for collectors in the field to send fossils to a paleontologist for classification .
Dr. Hayden 's fossils were classified by Edward Drinker Cope ( 1840 -1897 ) .
Cope had been for a time a student of Joseph Leidy .
Leidy , himself , about 1868 , began receiving fossils from two of Judge Carter 's sons - in - law , James Van Allen Carter and Joseph K. Corson .
Carter , not related to Judge Carter , had married Judge Carter 's daughter Anna and Corson married Ada .
Corson was an assistant surgeon at Fort Fred Steele and later post surgeon at Fort Bridger .
In 1872 , Leidy visited Fort Bridger and was taken into the forbidding Washakie Basin by Carter and Corson .
The Basin was described by Leidy as " an utter desert , a vast succession of treeless plains and buttes , with scarcely any vegetation and no signs of animal life . "
Indeed , he wrote , it was " undisturbed even by the hum of an insect . "
At the same time , Yale Professor Othniel Charles Marsh ( 1831 - 1894 ) began a series of expeditions into the west to gather fossils .
In 1877 , Railroad workers discovered large bones near Como Bluff and notified Professor Marsh .
Thus , it was discovered that while Wyoming may have been scarce in living fauna , it was rich in extinct life .
The competition , like the competition for the last girls in a saloon before closing hour , was on between Marsh and Cope .
Each had egos larger than the Uintatherium robustum discovered by Leidy .
The uintatherium , named after the Uinta Mountains , was a eocene mammel looking much like a cross between a hippopotamus and an elephant .
Cope , in fact , thought it to be related to the elephant and , thus , in a drawing put elephant ears on the animal .
Both Cope and Marsh had more Uintatherium fragments than Leidy and , thus , both attacked Leidy and each other .
Leidy , caught in the middle between the two , withdrew from further exploration in the West .
Excavation at Bone Cabin Quarry , 1898 , Photo from Century Magazine , 1904 The Bone Cabin Quarry at Como Bluff took its name from the fact that a cabin belonging to a local trapper was made of dinosaur bones .
Diplodocus Leg and Foot , Como Bluff , 1898 The Quarry , about ten miles from Como Bluff , was discovered in 1897 by Walter Granger ( 1872-1941 ) .
After 1903 , Granger diverted his attention to Paleocene and Eocene mammels .
He primarily devoted his attention to Wyoming from 1903 to 1918 .
Others who worked in the area included Edward Drinker Cope and Othniel Charles Marsh discussed below , and Barnum Brown , discussed with regard to the Bighorn Basin .
In one year alone , some 30 tons of dinosaur bones consisting of some 141 individuals were removed from the quarry .
Originally , Cope and Marsh were friends , having met at the University of Berlin and having a common interest in the study of fossils .
Marsh established himself as a professor at Yale without teaching duties as a result of a generous endowment by his uncle , George Peabody .
Cope was associated with the Philadelphia Acadamy and relied on his own personal fortune .
Following an expedition to Kansas in which both participated , Cope assembled a skeleton of an Elasmosaurus , a marine sauropod , and published a paper concerning his discovery .
Unfortunately , Cope , in his haste to announce to the world his new discovery , placed the head on the wrong end ; that is , the head was placed on the tail .
When the error was discovered , Cope immediately began buying back at his own expense all of the papers with the erroneous illustration .
Marsh , however , not missing an opportunity to enhance his own reputation , made sure the whole world knew of his former friend 's error and took delight in exposing Cope .
Marsh sarcastically wrote that Cope should have named the elasmosaurus " Steptosaurus , " " twisted reptile . "
[ Writer 's note : Marsh made a similar error .
It , however , was not acknowledged by the Peabody for more than 100 years .
Marsh placed the wrong head on a skeleton of a brontosaurus .
The Brontosaurus was used as a model for Brontosuauri all over the world .
The error , however , was not corrected by the Peabody until 1981 and required exhibits in museums throughout the world to be changed . ]
Additionally , Marsh began bribing Cope 's workers to send him , Marsh , new fossils from Cope 's fossil pits in New Jersey .
The result was an animosity between the two .
The animosity impacted on the U.S. Geological Survey with each backing different candidates for Director , Cope backing Dr. Hayden and Marsh backing John Wesley Powell .
Marsh Expedition of 1870 , engraving from Harper 's New Monthly Magazine , 1871 Things boiled over , however , in Wyoming .
Both Cope and Marsh conducted expeditions to the Territory ; Marsh using the military to provide protection against the Indians .
Marsh used his influence interfered with Cope 's ability to obtain accomodations or assistants at Fort Bridger and Cope was required to sleep in the Fort 's hay yard .
On Marsh 's first expedition in 1870 , Wm. F. Cody acted as a guide for the first leg of the journey .
Cody remained a life - long friend of Marsh and would visit with him every time Cody 's show would play in New Haven .
In 1879 , Cope showed up at the Como Bluff accusing Marsh of " trespassing " and stealing his fossils .
Marsh directed that the dinosaur pits be dynamited rather than allow fossels to fall into the " wrong hands . "
On another occasion , Cope had a train load of Marsh 's fossils diverted to Philadelphia .
Marsh , in turn , would attempt to delay Cope 's work by salting Cope 's digs with odd pieces of bone fragments unrelated to the fossils from the period in question .
Indian Funeral Platforms , Marsh Expedition of 1870 , engraving from Harper 's New Monthly Magazine , 1871 On the expedition , Marsh crossed Lakota lands without permission in violation of the 1868 Treaty of Ft. Laramie .
Nevertheless , Marsh seemed unconcerned about the Indians .
As indicated by the above engraving , the expedition came across an Indian funeral platform , upon which rested the bodies of a man and woman , beneath lay the skeleton of a pony .
It was the custom of some tribes of American Indians to place the bodies of the deceased on platforms with tokens of respect such a food .
Additionally , there might be sacrificed as a token of honor a horse .
After a period of time , some tribes would return and gather the bones of the deceased .
Marsh 's attitude was indicated by his admonition to the students : " Well , boys , perhaps they died of small - pox ; but we can't study the origin of the Indian race unless we have those skulls ! "
Turtle Fossil on Back of Horse , Marsh Expedition of 1870 , engraving from Harper 's New Monthly Magazine , 1871 Notwithstanding the concern by other members of the expedition as to ever more close smoke from Indian fires ahead , Marsh seemed only concerned with the collection of fossils .
In one instance , he recovered the fossil of a giant turtle .
While others wished to proceed in order to avoid a confrontation with the Indians , Marsh 's only concern , regardless of the reluctance of the horse , was the exhibition of the turtle in his museum in New Haven .
Students Surprised by Snakes , Marsh Expedition of 1870 , engraving from Harper 's New Monthly Magazine , 1871 Other hazards faced the expedition .
In one instance , while the students were bathing , an invasion of snakes occurred .
Red Cloud and Prof. O. C. Marsh , 1883
The Expedition was saved from being attacked by the Indians only by the fact that Marsh had personally befriended Red Cloud by promising to intercede with the Great Father on behalf of the Indians .
Marsh kept his word .
In 1883 , Red Cloud visited New Haven and called upon Professor Marsh .
Red Cloud observed : " I remember the wise chief .
He came here and I asked him to tell the Great Father something .
He promised to do so , and I thought he would do like all white men , and forget me when he went away .
But he did not .
He told the Great Father everything , just as he promised he would , and I think he is the best white man I ever saw . "
Cope had a different way of dealing with the Indians .
When visiting Indian camps , he would amuse them by taking out his false teeth .
The Indians were fascinated by an individual who could remove and then replace his teeth .
Cope was the more affable of the two .
Behind his back , Marsh was referred to at one of his clubs as the " Great Dismal Swamp . "
In contrast , one of Marsh assistant 's Arthur Lakes , from the Colorado School of Mines , was surprised to discover upon meeting Cope , that Cope , rather than the Monstrum horrendum Lakes was expecting , was actually quite friendly .
Marsh Expedition of 1870
In total , Marsh personally conducted four expeditions into Wyoming between 1870 and 1874 .
After that time , members of his staff would conduct the excavations and ship the fossils back to New Haven .
Pictured , left to right , George Bird Grinnell , Bill the cook , Charles Wyllys Betts , O.C. Marsh ( standing ) , Alexander Hamilton Ewing , Henry Bradford Sargent , Eli Whitney ( grandson of the inventor ) , Harry D. Ziegler , Charles T. Ballard , John Reed Nickolson , Charles McC. Reeve ( ?
possibly John Wool Griswold ) , Charles Matson Russell .
Grinnell later became the senior editor and publisher of Forest and Stream which was influential in the American conservation movement .
Grinnell was invited by George Armstong Custer to accompany his 1876 expedition into the Black Hills as the expedition 's naturalist .
Fortuitously , Grinnell had another engagement and declined .
He also was the founder of the original Audubon Society ( discontinued in Jan. 1889 ) and is regarded as the " Father of Glacier National Park " .
The animosity , nay , the hatrid one for the other , finally became public in January 1890 .
Cope had while on federally financed expeditions gathered numerous fossils , spending some $ 80,000.00 in his own funds on the effort .
Nevertheless , in 1889 the federal government required that the fossils be turned over to the government .
Cope blamed Marsh who had been sucessful in obtaining the upper hand with the Geological Survey .
Thus , in an article in the New York Herald written by W. H. Ballou , a friend of Cope , Cope blasted Marsh with both barrels .
Marsh had written a monograph on the evolution of the horse .
Cope accused Marsh of stealing the work of Russian vertebrate paleontologist Vladimir Kowalevsky who had earlier written on the same subject .
He claimed that his rival 's work was " the most remarkable collection of errors and ignorance of anatomy and literature on the subject ever displayed . "
In one sense , Marsh did have a remarkable collection of errors .
Over the years , Marsh had been lovingly collecting every perceived error that Cope had ever made .
The following week , Marsh responded in kind .
Using his collection of errors , he claimed that Cope had committed " a series of blunders , which are without parallel in the annals of science . "
Marsh indicated that when the first two had met in Berlin , he suspected Cope 's sanity .
With regard to Kowalevsky , Marsh alleged that Kowalevsky " was at least striken with remorse and ended his unfortunate career by blowing out his brains , " but , Marsh continued , " Cope still lives , unrepentant . "
In his haste to respond , Marsh was in error as to Kowalevsky .
Although , Kowalevsky committed suicide as a result of his penury , he did not shoot himself .
He used chloroform .
While the public denunciations of each other were of short lived interest , the wounds inflicted by Cope on Marsh had an ultimate impact .
Marsh wrote and published at his own expense a monograph on toothed birds .
It was read by several congressman , with the result that Marsh was fired from his work with the Geological Survey as an example of the waste of public money .
The end result of the Bone Wars was that each exhausted their respective fortunes .
Cope had to sell part of his collections .
Marsh had to mortgage his house and beg
Yale for a salary , the endowment from his uncle having been spent .
Today , Cope is regarded as the more intellectual of the two , but is regarded as careless .
Marsh is considered to be the better politician and was more careful in his work .
Marsh has been accused of taking credit for the work of his students .
Echoes of the Bone War reverberate today .
Today great controversy exists among paleontologists as to whether birds are descended from dinosaurs .
The theory was first proposed by Marsh in 1877 .
World ’s craziest restaurants
UNUSUAL AND CRAZY RESTAURANTS
For centuries , restaurants have been making the same fiscal error time and time again : serving delicious food at reasonable prices .
Truly a recipe for fiduciary disaster .
Here at least are ten restaurants that understand , to truly make a profit in the food business , you want to guarantee your patrons eat as little as possible , then get the hell out .
It ’s called “ high turnover . ”
Ask an economist .
Modern Toilet Restaurant – TAIWAN
Have you ever heard of people eating out of a bathroom toilet and having great fun ?
A restaurant named Marton Theme Restaurant , in Kaohsiung ( Taiwan ) has a toilet theme and is a great hit among people .
The restaurant has a bathroom decor , with colorful toilet seat being the standard chairs at the restaurant .
It also serves food in plates and bowls shaped like western loo seats and Japanese “ squat ” toilets .
Customers sits by a tables converted from a bathtub with a glass cover while looking at a wall decorated with neon - lit faucets and urinals turned into lamps .
The restaurant is named after the Chinese word “ Matong ” for toilet and is doing really well .
The owner Eric Wang says “ We not only sell food but also laughter .
The food is just as good as any restaurant but we offer additional fun .
Most customers think the more disgusting and exaggerated ( the restaurant is ) , the funnier the dining experience is . ”
The meals are cheaply priced with a meal set including soup and ice cream costs from 150 to 250 Taiwan dollars ( $ 6 – $ 10 ) .
For Cannibals – JAPAN
“ Nyotaimori ” ( which literally means “ female body plate ” ) is the name of the japanese restaurant that serves sushi and sashimi on a naked woman ’s body .
The body is made from food and placed on an operating table , much as though in a hospital .
You can “ operate ” anyway and anywhere you want by cutting open the body and eating what you find inside .
The body will actually bleed as you cut it and the intestines and organs inside are completely editable .
It ’s a banquet of Cannibalism .
In the Sky – BELGIUM
“ Dinner in the Sky ” is a Brussels based restaurant that serves dinner for up to 22 people … 150 feet in the air !

Flashlights , mobile phones and even luminous watches are prohibited while in this area .
The meal will be taken in this environment with the complete loss of vision .
By starving one ’s sense , your other senses are stimulated to full alert “ all so the theory goes ” and your food will taste like it ’s never tasted before .
In case you are wondering about the washrooms , they are all brightly lit .
Graveyard Restaurant – INDIA
The bustling “ New Lucky Restaurant ” in Ahmadabad is famous for its milky tea , its buttery rolls , and the graves between the tables .
Krishan Kutti Nair has helped run the restaurant built over a centuries - old Muslim cemetery for close to four decades , but he does n’t know who is buried in the cafe floor .
Customers seem to like the graves , which resemble small cement coffins , and that ’s enough for him .
“ The graveyard is good luck , ” Nair said one recent afternoon after the lunch rush .
“ Our business is better because of the graveyard . ”
The graves are painted green , stand about shin high , and every day the manager decorates each of them with a single dried flower .
They ’re scattered randomly across the restaurant – one up front next to the cash register , three in the middle next to a table for two , four along the wall near the kitchen .
Prison – ITALY
A restaurant situated inside the top security prison Fortezza Medicea in Italy is so popular that officials have since opened more branches .
Serenaded by Bruno , a pianist doing life for murder , the clientele eat inside a deconsecrated chapel set behind the 60ft high walls , watch towers , searchlights and security cameras of the daunting 500 - year - old Fortezza Medicea , at Volterra near Pisa .
Under the watchful eye of armed prison warders , a 20 - strong team of chefs , kitchen hands and waiters prepares 120 covers for diners who have all undergone strict security checks .
Tables are booked up weeks in advance .

But what ’s that on the side ?!
GRENADES !!!!!
Wa - BOOOOOOOMers !
Grenades means potato wedges .

Pull one of the gooey slices away and watch as vegetarian entrails slop off onto your camo tablecloth !
KaBLOOEY !
Just do n’t step on it !
And to make your dining experience all the more visceral , all Buns and Guns establishments play a continuous loop of rifle fire , mortar fire , and explosion sounds to eat by .

WASHINGTON , D.C. —
The Republican National Committee filed for bankruptcy today in the U.S. Court of Ideas , citing decades of doctrines that do n’t work and an inability to generate new thoughts and workable models for society .
WASHINGTON , D.C. —
The Republican National Committee filed for bankruptcy today in the U.S. Court of Ideas , citing decades of doctrines that do n’t work and an inability to generate new thoughts and workable models for society .
The GOP has been operating on an idea deficit for decades , according to court documents , and now its members are unable to create enough inspiration to bring their collective consciousness into the black .
“ We should have filed eight years ago , ” said former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich .
“ The GOP has been deliberating far above its means , for way too long . ”
Their most recent brainstorm involved morphing House Republicans into a single voting block to symbolically oppose the economic recovery package , while repeating the phrases “ this is not a stimulus bill ” and “ it ’s a sad day for America ” in unison .
“ We thought we were back in business with that one , ” lamented House Republican Leader John Boehner ( R - OH ) , “ Maybe we should have had them grimace more into the cameras . ”
“ We ’ve depleted the idea bank for our grandchildren , ” grumbled Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R- KY ) .
“ Future generations of Republicans will have to either come up with billions of high - quality ideas on their own , or vote Democratic . ”
“ The Golden Era of consuming ideas that we do n’t have is over , ” noted Gingrich .
“ The GOP can no longer wait for its own principles to bear fruit . ”
“ It ’s a sad day for America , ” added McConnell .
Unlike traditional bankruptcy , the Court of Ideas offers no Chapter 11 protection , which would have allowed Republicans to reorganize their thoughts .
Why can't the media connect the dots ?
Blaming the guns , but not the chemical child abusers ?
Kretschmer is a victim of chemical child abuse
( Natural News ) Yesterday we reported on the recent school shooting in Germany , emphasizing the link between psychiatric medications and acts of extreme violence ( https://www.naturalnews.com/025826.html ) .
From the facts that were known yesterday , it was already apparent that the shooter , Tim Kretschmer , was either on psychiatric medications or withdrawing from them .
His behavior and choice of targets ( including a worker at a psychiatric medical school ) pointed strongly towards his use of antidepressant drugs , which are known to cause violent thoughts and behavior .
Behind the scenes , I already knew from an industry source that Kretschmer had undergone psychiatric " treatment , " but I could not name that source and thus chose not to publish that fact until it could be further corroborated .
But today , the Associated Press confirms it .
In a story widely published across the ' net ( http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090312/ap_on_re... ) , police investigator Siegfried Mahler states on the record that the shooter ( Kretschmer ) " underwent several treatment sessions for depression at a psychiatric clinic " and was " ... prescribed a session of outpatient therapy , which he never began .
" Thus , the shooter was on psychiatric medications and then quit using them .
This created a classic antidepressant withdrawal crisis which is exactly what leads to extreme acts of violence against self or others .
As we reported in our previous story , virtually every school shooting that has taken place in the last two decades was carried out by those who either take psychiatric medications or are attempting to quit them .
The mainstream media , as usual , remains mystified about why so many teens would pick up deadly weapons and kill their classmates .
They seem to willingly ignore the truth about the rather obvious links between antidepressant drug use and acts of extreme violence .
It 's almost as if there is a willing conspiracy by the media to apologize for the pharmaceutical industry and avoid mentioning anything that might implicate Big Pharma 's drugs in these school shootings .
When will the ignorant people in our world finally realize the obvious ?
ThatAnd interjecting synthetic chemicals into a human brain instead of relying on nutrition and natural medicine that 's fundamentally compatible with human biology , you 're going to get some rather nasty results .
Germany , much like America , is reacting to this great tragedy in precisely the wrong way , banning guns instead of banning the chemical child abuse ( " psychiatric treatment " ) by psychiatrists who bear the real responsibility for these acts of violence in the first place .
If you take away the guns , .
Violence can be carried out with knives , or arson , or explosives or any number of other tools of destruction that can be easily accessed by a teenager in virtually any country .
The problem with teens today is not , simplistically , that they merely have access to too many guns , but thatwho conspire with the drug companies to profit from the pain and suffering of others .
Before the age of ADHD disease mongering , Ritalin drugging and SSRI " treatment " of children and teens , high school students in places like Texas routinely brought their guns to school .
They actually kept rifles and handguns in their school lockers ( this is not an exaggeration , it 's an historical fact ) .
Despite the easy access to so many guns , .
Ever wonder why ?
Because they were n't all drugged up on psych meds , of course !
School shootings are , without question , a direct effect of drugging teens with psychiatric medications .
And unless we stop chemically abusing our children with these dangerous prescription medications , you can bet that As I stated in 2006 ( https://www.naturalnews.com/020394.html ) , , and the weapons are chemical weapons sold by pharmaceutical companies and distributed by psychiatrists .
The innocent casualties of this war include schoolchildren , teachers , parents and even the trigger pullers .
We are witnessing a massacre , and it is being pushed forward every day , in virtually every country , by psychiatrists whose own arrogance and greed erases whatever human compassion they may have once held .
There is aunderway in psychiatric medicine today , and the battleground is now littered with the bloodied bodies of the girls and boys and teachers whose lives were stolen from them by an insidious medical - sounding front group known as " psychiatry .
" Watch this movie to learn the truth : http://www.cchr.org/#/videos/making-a-killin...
Or see this video on YouTube : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsfH_ap2Wgg
These are films the psych industry hopes you never see .
The last thing they want is the truth to get out about how much blood is on their hands .
Those parents who lost their children in this shooting should be marching on their local psychiatric treatment centers , demanding the arrest and prosecution of the so - called doctors who prescribed these dangerous psychotropic chemicals to the shooter who pulled the trigger .
It is almost certainly not mere coincidence that this German shooter specifically targeted and killed a psychiatric worker .
Perhaps somewhere in the back of his subconscious mind , hidden behind the pain and mental torture of psychtropic drug withdrawal , there was a part of his mind that remembered who had harmed him , and he sought to do something about it as his last willful act before being completely destroyed .
Make no mistake : , and it is the psychiatrists who bear responsibility for this great tragedy .
by altering his brain chemistry .
During his violent outrage , he was not in control of his own thoughts .
It is sad that he will be labeled a mad killer when , in reality , he is merely the predictable product of a torturous pharmaceutical experiment still being carried out on millions of children around the world .
Nor is Kretschmer the last violent shooter we will see .
As long as the industry of psychiatry exists , the world is an unsafe place for us all .
Think about your own coworkers or peers and ask yourself , " How many of them are on psychotropic meds right now ?
" See yesterday 's story on this topic here : https://www.naturalnews.com/025826.html

MySQL - looking for records in one table that do NOT correspond to records in another table
Q : Can you give an example where I can retrieve all the records of a table " users " where there are no corresponding records in other table " user_role "
A : No ( sorry - I 'm too busy to set up tables of these names for a demo ) but I DO have an example that show you .
We have a table of agents ( realtors ) and a table of properties they are selling .
• with a regular join , you get all matching records
&bull with a left join , you get all matching records PLUS a row for all the records in the left hand table that do n't have anything matching them in the right table
• with a left join and a " where [ fieldname ] is NULL , you get all the records in the first table that have nothing matching in the second .
Note - you must use is and not = to compare to NULL ; NULL is not a value ( it is the absence of a value ! ) so nothing can be equal to it !

Why most training fails ...
Related topics : via article database More about Graham Ellis of Well House Consultants Useful link : MySQL training
" Why most training fails ... " ... a headline from a newsletter / newsfeed which comes in to me each morning .
[ article ]
And most of what the article says is true .
To quote from the article : " While these methods may get high marks from participants , research ( ignored by many training professionals ) shows they rarely change behaviour on the job .
Knowing is n't the same as doing ; good intentions are too easily crushed by old habits . "
The methods being discussed / listed include " lectures ( " spray and pray " ) , inspirational speeches or videos , discussion groups and simulation exercises " .
We 're very much aware that a critical aspect of training is that what we teach is retained by , and used by our delegates once they get back to their place of work / onto the job .
And we make an effort to ensure that the subjects learned are indeed subsequently applied .
Mind you , we 're very lucky in that the subjects we teach , and the roles that our delegates are in , leave those delegates little choice but to apply what they have learned in their job roles .
So ... how do we , consciously , attempt to ensure that the use of technologies and skills learned on our courses are used into the future by as many or our delegates as possible :
• Our training is subject rather than concept base .
You come along to us to Learn to program in Python and if you have to program ' back at the office ' , you 'll have little choice but to apply these skill .
But we help that along ...
• We ask each and every delegate about their background , and what they will be doing with the subject being learned , and we encourage each of them to bring their own data , tell us what their data looks like , do practical exercises which are relevant to them and are the first step of what they will be doing with the subject back in their office .
• We lecture .
Then we demonstrate ( and the demonstrations vary to be relevant for the particular delegates ) , then we set a practical .
There 's a cynical saying in training .
" Tell them what you will tell them , tell them , then tell them what you have told them and they may remember it . "
But perhaps it 's not all that cynical - it 's reinforcement .
There 's no way that even the brightest of people can remember every work said throughout a 3 to 5 day course !
• We follow up .
All examples from the notes are published on our web site , delegate 's work is emailed back to them , and they can visit our forum or archived previous forum or email me later to ask questions .
We even provide a web site form for ANYONE to use to encourage people .
The ' stiff British upper lip " style of " I wo n't want to trouble you " sometimes clicks in , and we remind delegates that we want them to ask ; it 's in our interest that they apply the subject and recommend others to us later , rather than forgetting us .
• We keep group sizes small - no more that 8 on a public course so that there is plenty of time for the tutor to deal with individual 's specific needs in terms of subjects and pace .
• we encourage people to keep in touch via our blog and my Twitter feed .
And to drop in and see us at the Hotel / training centre .
With our infectious enthusiasm , our reinforcement , our real - use examples and our follow ups , we seem to do pretty well in the ' effectiveness ' stakes , but we 're always looking to improve on that .
And I am humbly grateful that our topics are not ' blue sky concept ' ones but things that are really useful and used by our delegates when they get back to their own desks .
We 're in an area of training which is naturally very effective indeed in the first place .

Funny Amusing and Funny Amazing ... that was the title of a paper back book that Dad bought for half a crown when I was young , and it was so much fun looking down the rib - tickling things on the left had side of each spread , and the jaw - dropping things on the right .
It 's funny [ amusing ] how one word can have several meanings - indeed , when I 'm running Perl courses , I often write on the board " Reading ... " and ask people to pronounce the word .
Of course , I could complete the sentence with " is a place " and it would be ' Redding ' , or " is a skill " in which case it would be ' Reeding ' .
And in Perl ...
@reading is a list where each element is a separate scalar or
@reading is a scalar which is the number of elements in a list or
@reading ( in quotes ) is a string which comprises all the members of the list joined together into a scalar , with a space between each of them .
How did I come up with this article today ?
Chris tells me that two smart delelegates have checked in already ( is n't Skype great ! ) and I respond with " I have better not come in to work in jeans and teashirt . "
But it turns out that he was meaning Smart ( Intelligent ) rather than Smart ( Well Dressed ) .

How to tweet automatically from a blog
Related topics : via article database
How to Tweet from a Blog
I 'm using the MoveableType Blog software for " The Horses 's Mouth " ... and I want to tweet my subject line for each new post .
But I 'm lazy , so I have set it up to happen automatically .
1 . I post my blog entry in the usual way
2 . I have added the following script at / home / wellho / tweeter / blogtweet on my server :
< php
mysql_connect ( " 127.0.0.1 " , " databaseuser " , " databasepassword " ) ;
mysql_select_db(" wellho " ) ;
$rs = mysql_query ( " select entry_id , entry_title from mt_entry order by entry_id desc limit 1 " ) ;
$ hv = mysql_fetch_assoc ( $rs ) ;
$ leid = file_get_contents ( " blogtweet.txt " ) ;
if ( $ leid == $ hv[ entry_id ] ) exit ( ) ;
`curl -- basic -- user wellho : twitterpassword -- data status= " [ diary ] - $ hv[ entry_title ] - http://www.wellho.net/mouth/$hv[entry_id]_.html "
http://twitter.com/statuses/update.xml`;
$ fh = fopen ( " blogtweet.txt " , " w " ) ;
fputs ( $ fh , $hv[ entry_id ] ) ;
fclose ( $fh ) ;
?>
See update ( at end of this post ) w.r.t. this code , which needed update , August 2009
3 . I have added a regular timed ( crontab ) job on the server as follows :
10,25,45,58 * * * * cd /home/wellho/ tweeter ; /usr/local/bin/php blogtweet > / dev/null
So - about every 15 to 20 minutes - my server checks if a new blog entry has been added .
And if it has , it uses curl to submit an update to twitter .
Note :
a) If I submit two blog items very quickly in succession , the first one may not be tweeted .
b ) There is a time lapse of up to 20 minutes between me blogging and tweeting .
c ) My script is n't ' clever ' if I include quotes in my subject line
d ) I have n't ( in this simple example ) checked the blog entry to make sure that it 's actually been published .
e ) An alternative curl that I tried ( and worked ) using Json was as follows :
curl -u wellho : twitterpassword -d status = " Trying to Autotweet " http://twitter.com/statuses/update.json
Update - 9th August 2009 - The -- basic option no longer works - indeed , tweets using it are simply being lost .
Remove the option and carry on as before .
I suspect that this change relates to the problems that Twitter have had over the last few days .

Learning to Twitter / what is Twitter ?
Related topics : via article database
Have you come across Twitter - http://twitter.com.
I expect some of the folks who read here will have done so !
Twitter is a " microblog " - a message of up to 140 characters that you can update as often as you like ... and that message is called a tweet .
Boris Johnson , Barak Obama , Steven
Fry all twit ... and have lots of followers .
And Graham Ellis has just started to twit under the user name wellho and - err - does n't actually have any followers yet .
It looks like one of the interesting things about Twitter is that you can read combined tweets from lots of different people - you can ' follow ' and knwo what 's going on with a lot of people all on the same page .
Will I have time to keep tweet 'in as well as all the other things I do ?
Perhaps not , but I am experimenting with tweeting automatically from this blog - so that the subject lines will provide blog links and people can watch my blog purely on headlines , along with watching other twits ( I suspect I 'm not supposed to use that name ! )
My userid is wellho and you can see my rudimentary page at http://twitter.com/wellho.

Hire Car , from Atlanta Airport
Related topics : via article database
It 's only 3 days since we landed back in the UK ... yet it seems an age ago .
I have written an incredible number of emails , created a new forum , and dealt with more than one major issue that 's of the nature that I can't blog about it .
This morning , I was up at 04:30 and prepared breakfast for over 20 people .
So this picture , taken at Ellijay in Georgia , seems like it's from a different age rather than Sunday evening !
I 'm not usually one for cars , but there 's something about the PT Cruiser that I find attractive , and I 've enjoyed being driven in Sister - in - law Pat 's car of that type .
But what 's the chance of a hire car company such as Alamo coming up with such a vehicle ?
Well ... stranger things have happened .
At Atlanta Airport , gone are the days of " your car is in row D space 98 " ( where D stands for distant , and numbers start at 1 ! ) , and it's now - " these are the midsize cars .
Take whichever you like " and , yes , this car was amongst them .
I have to say it 's a good , customer satisfaction move on the part of Alamo - we certainly left the airport feeling that we had made a positive choice , rather than being foisted with a car which the sales rep had chosen for us from the bottom of the stack when we chose not to buy all the insurances and an upgrade .
In fact - I have to give the lady at the hire car counter top marks for explaining the insurances carefully and NOT coming across as if she was trying to sell them all , and double credit for helping us get in touch with Tyler and Alyssa to let them know we were in the country .
I did n't take a note of your name - but thank you , for making it such a great welcome .
And do you know what ?
I expect we 'll hire from Alamo next time too , even if they 're a few dollars more .

Ask the Tutor - Open Source forum
Related topics : via article database Useful link : Ruby training
Well - I 've taken the plunge !
When I installed a YaBB forum some seven years ago , I never imagined that it would grow as big as it did , with hundreds of posts on each of the subjects covered .
And with that growth came growth panes where the forum became " Pot Bound " - unable to grow any further .
So , over the last couple of hours ( and in answer to a " where is there a good Expect forum ? " question I have installed a Simple Machines Forum called " Ask the Tutor " to replace " Opentalk " .
The URL is http://www.wellho.net/ask
The main intent of the forum is to give past delegates on courses somewhere they can ask questions and share experiences , but I 'm happy for others to register and post up good , Open Source , questions too .
That way , the forum will develop and help everyone .
So - please visit " Ask the Tutor " , register , and say " Hello " .

What do people think of our Apache httpd / Tomcat course ?
Related topics : via article database
We train a lot of well known ( no - make that VERY well known ) names , as well as smaller organisations , and contractors and individuals too .
And we thrive on customer feedback and recommendation - yet at the same time , we respect the privacy of our clients .
So the following is reproduced with permission , and I 'm only going to tell you that it 's " A large UK service provider " who wrote it ...
Dear Graham ,
It was good to meet you last week .
Thank you for the excellent introduction into Apache and tailoring the content for our own requirements .
Feedback from the team has been excellent and I myself thought it was also superbly delivered and fully met the agreed objectives .
Only other thing suggestion ( I have now realized … ) we could have made it 3 days and had more on troubleshooting and customizing logs for Apache and web apps .
But we have now got a solid foundation to move forward and discover for ourselves J I will keep you in mind for any of our future needs and pass your details on within our organization , Here ’s some additional feedback I gathered : Score from 1 to 5 , with 1 being the ‘ Best ’
1 Appropriate to my role and responsibilities = 1
1 Usefulness for platform issues / trouble shooting = 1
1 Assist with further analysis and enhancements of the platform = 1
1 Trainers knowledge and course delivery =1
1 Facilities and accommodation =1
Any other comments :
Well presented course clearly delivered .

If you have any questions please do n’t hesitate to contact me .
Best regards ,
Thank you Xxxx - much appreciate the feedback .
The comments related to a private , 2 day course that we ran at Well House Manor last week for a group of 5 delegates , who stayed with us .
The course agenda was based on our public Deploying Apache httpd and Tomcat course , but with some of less relevant issues ( e.g. some of the connectors ) covered only in outline , and with the addition of material on ab ( ApacheBench ) , JMX , Jconsole , Garbage Collection and JMeter added .
I am in agreement with the review that the course could usefully have extended to a third day in this case , but " time is money " and customers have limited budgets - we do n't attempt to stretch material to fill extra time , preferring to deliver a short , quite intensive course .

Visiting Family
Related topics : via article database
Lisa and I have been spending a few days with son Tyler and his wife Alyssa in Georgia - all four of us are pictured here at the Amicalola falls ( which you can see through the trees because the leaves are , as yet missing ) , with another passing early season visitor taking the picture for us .
It 's one of those tourist spots where everyone says " hi " , rather than one of those spots where everyone pushes for their place in line !
Tyler and Alyssa are living on the Georgia and Tennessee border - and you 'll see how literally they ARE on the border from this picture , with the state line running right through their apartment block ( and through their own apartment too ) .
This is Copperhill , TN - and McCaysville , Georgia .
It 's been a catch - up weekend , and a chance to talk past , present and future .
A chance to get to know Alyssa a little better .
And as you can see from this picture , Tyler and Alyssa are very much looking forward .
A lovely couple , and I 'm proud to have them as part of our family , all a part that we have n't seen as often as we would have liked .
I remember one of our friends describing it as " Damned Geography " , and and of you folks who have a spread out family will know what I mean .
I like this picture , and I think it sets a theme and a route forward .
I do n't know exactly where Tyler and Alyssa will end up in life , but they are clearly - so clearly - a couple and suited for each other ; on the same wavelength if you like .
They 've already had a number of those bumps and jolts , and been strengthened by them .
And I look forward to that strength growing and to them developing / moving on to something ( and perhaps somewhere ) they 'll really blossom and enjoy .

Should I maintain the programming code on my own website ?
Related topics : via article database
A Question from my inbox :
Graham ,
[ snip ]
I did lot of FORTRAN programming myself in 80's , but mostly as a tool for solving engineering problems .
For about 15 months , I maintained a 27000 line raw FORTRAN code , written by 8 Ph.D. souls .
In 1998 , I created a passive website for myself ( Bridge problems and solution ) , and in 2001 , switched to postnuke CMS .
Over time , I lost my skills in coding , and lost touch too .
Thus , when comment spamming infested my website www.demicoma.com, I simply threw in the towel , and stopped site updation .
Perhaps , I rationalised by postulating that I could not do both the form and content based myself and that was why the site was languishing .
Today , after the recession bit our engg .
activity , I have more time on hand and was thinking whether that postulate was correct .
Basically , the question is , should I , a bridge expert - author - commentator of international standing , maintain the bridge site as well !!
I ask you because you seem to have so many websites and you seem to be managing both the form and content rather effortlessly ( pardon my use of the term - but I guess you know what I mean ) .
Of course , the form and content are intertwined in a special way for your work , and it would not be so for anyone else .
Leaving aside that aspect , could you please let me know your views on this issue ?
thanks and regards ,
And my answer :
Dear Xxxxxx ,
Yes , I remember you and them well .
And that was an enjoyable course to give .
Your question is a superb one ( in fact - would you mind me sharing my answer to you with readers of my blog , as I think it has more general interest ) - in summary asking " should I do my own non - flat website work , or look for other means " .
That permission has been granted - Thank you
I can't answer that question for you - but I can give you some ideas , and they come down to the very first line of this answer where I said " and that was an enjoyable course to give " .
If you have the ability ( which clearly you have , even if you would need to ( re ) learn some techniques ) , if you have the time ( which you 're indicating you might have ) , and if you would have the commitment ( which is made - in my personal case at least - by getting enjoyment out of it ) , then yes , why not take on your own coding / updating / behind the scenes work ?
But I can't tell you - who I have met only for a short time - what you enjoy , nor do I know how much time you really have .
I see it as the most enormous compliment to our team ( sorry if it was n't intended that way ! ) when you talk about us looking after the site ' effortlessly ' .
I 'm very happy it looks like that ; behind the scenes , we have a site that has grown over the years and is very ( needlessly ) complex - ' for historic reasons ' being an excellent excuse .
Because we wrote most of the software , it 's easy to add a tweak here and a tuning there .
But it is also easy for us to leave ourselves vulnerable to holes that we accidentally code in ; they 're not as bad as having a hole in something like PostNuke , because who in the community of hackers is going to bother to spread the world about our little hole which runs on only a single host as opposed to a piece of software that 's running in quite a lot of places .
But there are parts of our software that we did not write ourselves - the Forum and the Blog as complete ' units ' for example , and other modules for Google maps , for identifying IP addresses down to geographic locations ( Maxmind ) , for handline RSS feeds ( magpierss ) , for generating graphics ( phplot ) and others which I 'm sure I 've overlooked as I put this answer together .
Yet in most ( no - I 'll correct that - in ALL ) of those cases we have tailored the code provided and gone beyond what the author 's intent probably was .
As an example , with the Blog software which is Moveable Type we extract the content into our own archives and search and ranking system so that we can tell Google via a site map something about relative ratings .
I guess what I am saying is " if you are capable ( very clearly you are ) , if you have the time ( it sounds like you might ) , if you would enjoy it so that you did a good job ( that 's the question I throw back to you ) , then YES it would be a good idea . "
But do n't rule out the use of code that people have written already , and do n't underestimate the time and effort it would take to write and maintain for the foreseeable future .
I write to you from Blue Ridge , Georgia today - but look at my blog for the last few days ( http://www.wellho.net/horse) and you 'll see entries about how to move and rename a page without loosing ranking , and how to track down and trace intermittently manifesting bugs , so I 'm never off duty .
While I was answering , it struck me that our " PHP techniques " weekend might be exactly what you need - it 's coming up in 2 months .
It 's described at : [ link ]
That 's a new blog entry - it 's been on my list to write up more formally since I first mentioned it to a few people ( and we already have a booking ) - another illustration of what goes on behind the scenes .
I hope that the above has been helpful - and if it 's right , so see you in May ( and if not , please feel free , still , to ask me further questions , etc !
Whatever your decision , I 'm sure you 'll do fine !
Graham

A room without a view
Related topics : via article database
Lisa and I are staying at the Comfort Inn , in Blue Ridge .
It 's on a road called the " Outlook " and there are views from both sides of the hotel - on the ridge - to the mountains .
What a pity that some tw*t decided to build an oversized awning over the entrance to the hotel and block the view from a handful of the rooms , including ours ...

PHP Course - for hobby / club / charity users .
Related topics : via article database
Are you looking after a PHP based web site but want to do more with it ?
Perhaps it 's the web site for your cricket club , your local school , or a charity or special interest group you work with ?
What is this course all about ?
Traditionally , our courses have run during the week and been aimed at commercial organisations - smaller groups of delegates , intensive courses to get the employees of those companies - for whom time is money - quickly and well trained during work hours .
But more and more requests are coming our way for something that 's more suited for the enthusiast / hobby end of the market .
So we 're running - as an experiment initially - a PHP techniques weekend .
Here are the ' bullets ' :
• The course will be residential at our Melksham , Wiltshire training centre and hotel .
• It is aimed at those with some ( not necessarily a lot ) of PHP experience
• The objective of the two days is to ensure that you 'll have a great learning weekend and leave able to do a lot more of what you want to do
• you 'll be able to get back with the tutor - and perhaps with your fellow delegates - after the course with follow up questions
• and you 'll have fun !
( If you have no prior PHP knowledge , this particular weekend is n't the one for you - please email me - graham@wellho.net )
This is an example that we 'll have available during the course - showing current issues with train service ( lines ) and on the roads ( spots ) in the South West of England .
It 's a dynamic diagram so it may just be an outline - or it may be covered on data to indicate serious transport problems !
See here for a detailed key .
When is the course and how does it run ?
The course will be run by Well House Consultants who run a full training program in Open Source programming at their Well House Manor training centre in Melksham , Wiltshire where clients include many of the top uk companies , educational establishments and government bodies .
The same equipment and training rooms will be used for this course , which will be lead by Graham Ellis who is the author of the material and Director of Well House .
Arrive on the evening of Friday , 22nd May 2009 .
Settle in / get online / get set up using the course web server that will run your code , and get to know your fellow delegates .
Saturday , 23rd May
We 'll start the day after an early breakfast with a review of PHP - a dash through the basics to help you pick up on any little missing holes in your knowledge , and to help you qualify your code so that you 'll start looking at easy of writing and maintainance , and code security , as the future bedrock of your coding .
Those might be low down your priority list at the moment , but they 'll become critical on a popular site .
Linking a series of visits by the same user together into a session is a critical part of many web applications , and after coffee we 'll look at sessions , and how to write good session code - you may have heard terms like " 4 layer model " and MVC and we 'll see how those design approaches can be applied , together with worked examples .
Lunch will be provided .
In the afternoon , we 'll look at some specific subjects , with practical sessions and assistance based on our library of modules .
Each delegate will be invited to broach a subject before these sessions begin , and we 'll cover topics relevant to everyone .
Here 's a taster of some of the subjects on offer :
* Optimising your dynamic pages for the search engines such as Google
* Finding resources - already written code , modules , and answers
* Naughty Word Filtering , Spell Checking , suggesting similar words
* Checking your user is real ( answer a question , type text from a graphic )
* Data Validation / making your site easy to use / Avoiding bloopers
* Getting users to sign in and maintaining user accounts .
" Forgot my password "
* Credit card and other secure payment issues
* Linking web data to and from your other ( nonweb ) databases
* Consistent look and feel and flexibility - using CSS with PHP
* Cutting in feeds from other sites - RSS , SOAP and other options
* Identifying where in the world your visitor is coming from
* Did your visitor arrive via a search engine ?
What are they looking for ?
* Making use of mapping resources such as Google on your site
* Providing User Feedback screens
* Writing for a wide variety of browsers
* Should we be using Flash / Ajax / Javascript ?
* Should I use PHP objects ?
* Producing dynamic maps , diagrams and graphs through PHP
* Sorting results by location
* Site searches - how to produce helpful results
* Caching and other loading issues
* Selecting your web space provider , and running your own server
* This list in not exhaustive - bring your code and questions
We 'll run into the early evening - the training room will be accessible to you as late as you like , and the tutor around until mid evening if required .
Sunday , 24th May
After breakfast , a more formal session will look at the wider responsibility of running a web site - issues from copyright to data protection and privacy , and from usability through security , and from Disability Discrimination to Acceptable User and moderation policies .
These may not be ' PHP Programming ' subjects , but they are just as important for you to have a legal and successful web site .
After Coffee , we 'll spend time on how to write secure , reusable code and how to deal with all manner of security issues .
" Do I really need this for my little site that 's concerned with the Netherhampton Rugby Club " you may ask .
Yes , you do ; if you leave an opening , you could find an application at www.netherhamptonrugbyclub.org.uk that you 've forgotten about has become a hotbed of porn ( I 've been there ! )
Late morning , and afternoon ( lunch provided once again ) , we 'll be back to the list of topics that was drawn up on Saturday .
Late afternoon , and a concluding summary ... and you can be on your way .
You 'll go away with a lot more knowledge of PHP - and a wider knowledge as to how it can be applied to your site .
You 'll go away with ideas , and with links and materials through which you can practically follow them up .
And you 'll leave with a support route and contacts with and through whom you can raise further issues .
Delegates are welcome to stay on Sunday evening and into Monday morning - Monday is a bank holiday , and there 's a great deal to see in Wiltshire !

Where is my new Apache httpd installed
Related topics : via article database Useful link : PHP training
When you 're installing a software package you have the install script writer has a choice - whether to put it all in one place so that you can easily remove it again if it does n't work for you , or whether to spread the elements far and wide so that each element is on an area of the disc which has an appropriate backup strategy and ownership .
And the choice is n't a clear one - neither way of doing it is right or wrong - both are imperfect .
Most of us install much more software than we end up actually using , and the ability to try something out with the knowledge that we can remove it very easily if it does n't work out is attractive - and that " install in one place " philosophy is the approach taken by the Open Source community .
If something that you 've put into /usr / local works out for you , it 's not a big deal to move the start - up script into /etc / init.d and add a couple of links from / etc / rc3.d or /etc / rc5.d , nor to move the dynamic data area to some other area of the file system where it will be regularly backed up .
But even that moving of a few elements around may be more than the home user , wanting a minimal of computer knowledge , is prepared ( or indeed able ) to do , and that 's where the Microsoft / packaged and with install wizzards to wave a wand and throw things into lots of places comes in - and is perhaps well suited for that market .
Here 's a top level directory listing of a recently installed Apache httpd ; the subdirectories will be similar for other open source installs , and if you 're making your install permanent , this is the area where you 'll want to ( a ) move a few things around and ( b ) change your configuration files so that the software ' knows ' you have done so .
What have we in this directory ?
bin , build , lib , include and modules should be left where they are - they are the programs associated with the installation , and all the extra bits of rarely - changing stuff that is brought in at run time .
If you add modules such as jk or php ( yes , PHP loads as a module ) , they will be in the modules subdirectory , for example .
You probably do n't want to move conf although logically it might go into the /etc directory ; it contains the configuration information for the software installed , and should be changed only rarely and only by the administrator - so having it in this well protected , read mostly , rarely backed up area is sensible .
This example is a web server - and so the data at the initial install is the data for the web site that its supports .
And the default location is htdocs , with standard icons for automatic indexes in icons and the httpd manual in manual .
The htdocs should - for sure - be moved ( or , better a new one created elsewhere ) and the config file / usr / local / apache2 / conf / httpd.conf [ default ] changed to reflect the change at two places in the file , please note !.
icons and manual should be left where they are , as you 'll surely not be changing the icons nor altering the Apache manual , will you ?
Programs that the web server can run ( if and only if the facility has been switched on - Options ExecCGI - off by default ) are in the cgi-bin directory , and you really should create a new one of those , and point your configuration file at it , if you 're using the facility .
It 's usual to place the new cgi-bin directory as a sibling of the new htdocs , so that the changing web site ( as looked after by a web site developer ) is all in one neat bundle for backups / copies / looking after .
Finally , logging is to the logs directory .
It 's possible for you to choose to leave this where it is ( but please add a crontab job to move the log file to an archive and start a new one every so often ) .
You could also move it to a separate log are - / var / logs or / var / spool seem sensible places .
And the third popular choice is to move the logs to another sibling of the new cgi-bin and htdocs , allowing the developer / web site maintainer direct access to them .
On a major productions system , / var / summat is probably favoured ; for something not quite so major , the sibling approach would be preferred .
But it 's very much a decision you should make based on the balance and use of the web server .
This subject is covered in some detail on our Linux Web Server course , and at a lesser level on our Deploying Apache httpd and Tomcat course , where the main topic is Tomcat which almost always sits behind a relatively lightly configured httpd .

Blue Ridge and Melksham Chambers of Commerce
Related topics : via article database
Seeing a sign marked " Fannin County - Chamber of Commerce " at the roadside here in Blue Ridge , Georgia , and being elected within the last few months as the President of Melksham 's Chamber of Commerce on a platform of " Let 's have this Chamber be a really effective voice and help for the businesses of Melksham " , I decided to take the bull by the horns , pop in and say ' hello ' and learn a bit about how a Chamber of Commerce works in the USA .
Both Fannin County and Melksham have populations of between 20,000 and 25,000 so the comparison seems a fair one - but the Chambers of Commerce are as different as chalk and cheese .
Now that 's party caused by the different statutory natures of the beasts - in the USA , The Chamber is partly ( largely ? ) funded by a bed tax , levied by hotel and guest houses and self - catering outlets on our of town stayers - and in this county , a holiday area , there are some 1000 beds covered .
And that places The Chamber ( most of who 's members are in the tourist business ) in the role of Tourist Information Centre too .
Here 's me and a Jode Hanson of the Fannin County Chamber of Commerce in their own offices / TIC - open seven days a week for the area 's businesses - and for the customers of those businesses too ( and that largely means tourists ) .
In many ways , it 's streets apart from the Melksham Chamber , which is still recovering from controversies , at a time before Lisa and I were in town , that related to whether or not the chamber should support certain local developments .
For every member that the Melksham Chamber has , the Fannin County chamber has 25 .
And yet when I look at the Fannin County Chamber - and ( we were told ) it is one of the most successful around - I see many things happening which fit our aspirations too .
Support of local businesses and their customers ; supporting members ; local networking ; an information source .
Lisa and I came away with ideas .
And with a variety of samples ranging from maps produced by the chambers to their member directories handed out to area visitors .
And copies of member paperwork too , such as the chamber 's literature advocating membership , listing benefits and including a joining up form .
These will be reminders for us when we get back .
Before the month is out , you 'll see more on the Melksham Chamber of Commerce - both here and elsewhere .
Much of the preparation work has been done behind the scenes .
But it was really great to see a bustling CoC here in Fannin County , giving us confirmation that what we 're looking to do is universal , and along the right lines .

If you have a spelling mistake in your URL / page name
Related topics : via article database
What do I do if someone reports a spelling mistake on one of our pages ?
I check that they 're right ( OK - I usually know straight away that they ARE as I 'm one of the world 's worst spellers and often distort one word into another valid word ) , and fix the page .
And drop them a brief " thank you " of course .
It 's actually a help to us to correct even quite small goofs - helps our huge web site look more professional , and the changes indicate to search engines that they 're not just indexing a decaying archive .
But what if a spelling mistake extends to the URL ?
To correct or not to correct ?
If there are links to the page , especially external ones ( Q - how can you tell ... - you can't be sure , but your combined web log gives you a clue ) , or if it 's been indexed by the search engines and is popular ( Q - how can you tell ... A - same as previous answer ) , you do n't want to loose the URL , nor do you want it to survive unmodified as the current / used link .
So along comes - once again - our " superhero " - mod_rewrite .
Mod_rewrite can be used to rewrite the faulty location to the correct one , and you can place the page at the correct location .
Or you could leave the page where it is , and use mod_rewrite to create a new URL for it .
Perhaps better would be to relocate the page , and send out a " moved permanently " message to the browser - that 's a return status 301 .
The particular example that I had this a.m. related to my corruption of the name Pennines into Penines , in our " share " directory .
The directory already has a .htaccess file , already has mod_rewrite enabled , so the extra line I added to do the " 301 " divert was :
RewriteRule ^penines\ .(.* ) $ / share / pennines .$ 1 [ R=301,L ]
Oh - and I moved the page ;-)
Try it out : penines.html ( wrong ) link and pennines . html ( right ) link

This seven lane highway is on the outskirts on Atlanta ... and the road lines and traffic naturally draw the eye to look at Atlanta Downtown which - although small - is significant in the picture
Even without any formal lines , are n't you looking to the front of this queue at Gatwick to see what we 're waiting for ?

Tracking difficult bugs , the programmer / customer relationship
Related topics : via article database
If you 've been programming for a while , you have probably come across one or two of those code bugs that are really really really hard to reproduce , track down and fix .
And yet - when you do track them down / fix them from live ( production ) code , your users / customers just shrug their shoulders and you get comments like " if it only took you a minute or two to fix when you found what it was , why on earth did it take you so long to find what it was in the first place ? "
I 've had one of these ' incidents ' running over the last few days .
The support pledge to ask people who are in favour of , and would use and benefit from , an improved TransWilts train service ( www.transwilts.org.uk) is backed up by a page that includes a list of signatories so far .
When I wrote it , it worked .
When I tested it , it worked .
When I revisited it , it worked .
When others visited it , it worked .
Then someone report it had failed - a big gap between the two columns of names , and the right - most column so squished that the names folded - fault .
I tested it again - visited the page and ... it worked .
Correspondence - " which browser are you using " and " what 's your screen resolution , but the problem went away - even for the reporter , it worked .
I tried it the next day to make sure , and it worked .
Another failure report came in - fault .
And deciding that there had to be * something * in these reports I visited the page and ( to be honest , to my surprise ) I got fault using exactly the same browser that had previously been working .
But at least I now had evidence on my screen , and I was able to capture the HTML of that evidence and see just WHY it was happening .
Here 's the excuse explanation :
Around 10 % of our signups ask that their name be withheld rather than appearing on our page .
That 's for people in the railway industry , for example , who want to show their support but can't have their names out on our site because of their jobs .
As each name is added on to the display , our code says " am I exactly halfway through the names I have to display " and if the answer is ' yes ' , it starts a new column - thus giving two columns .
However , if there happened to be a " name withheld " exactly halfway through , the answer to that question will be ' yes ' not once ... but twice ( the program loop before AND the program loop after the name to be hidden ) and so the new column code is run twice , and we ended up with an extra blank column ; we also ended up with columns with a total width or 150 % of the width of the table , which browsers may get confused about .
When you think about it , the explanation makes logical sense when looked at against the evidence , with more people signing up as the campaign runs , so the problem appearing and disappearing as a certain Mr M ..... ( name withheld ! ) is exactly halfway through or slides forwards or back a couple of places .
The solution was to replace :
if ( ( $nsf + $ anonc - 1 ) == $ halfway )
$ names .= " < td > < td width=50 % valign=top class=nonitaltext > " ;
by :
if ( $ split == 0 and ( $nsf + $ anonc - 1 ) == $ halfway ) {
$ names .= " < td > < td width=50 % valign=top class=nonitaltext > " ;
$ split=1 ; }
which rather brutally ensures only a single new column by adding a flag variable ( which , yes , I have initialised before the start of the loop ) .
The solution does n't answer he question " if the problem was so small , why did it take you so long ? " , but I hope that this article does - as a whole go some way to providing that answer .
As a footnote , I want to add further comment :
It is very easy - far TOO easy - for the programmer in these circumstances to assume that the problem is caused by user error - indeed , I incorrectly did so at first , and I apologise .
The strong consideration must be given to user error , but not to the extend of it becoming an assumption .
It is hard on the user experiencing the problems too ; should he / should he not keep reporting them - especially if intermittent - so a programmer who 's dubious as to their validity .
And IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE , I want to thank L** who has been the primary reporter for his positive approach and good nature while we have been sorting it .
L** - you 're quite exceptional and I 'm proud to have you as a friend as well as a colleague in campaign .

C , C++ and C# ... Java and JavaScript
Related topics : via article database
With all the words in the world , and the ability to make more up , is n't it astonishing that we have in our business some confusingly similar names for programming languages !
C v C++ v C#
C is the bedrock language that 's used to write all the modern operating systems , device drivers , other languages , and also code that needs to be tuned / run very fast .
Sometimes it's the " grandparent " language rather than the parent in the " is written in " relationship .
C++ is an object oriented language and truly is that very important OO element added to C , maintaining C compatibility .
Yes , there ARE things in C which a good C++ programmer wo n't use as the have been superseded , but the similarity and compatibility is there .
C# is a different language .
It is based on the design philosophies of C , and indeed of C++ , but it removes the extra complexities imposed on C++ by the need to be compatible with C , and it's a much more recent language so can and does include decisions made to help coding be done more quickly at the expense of larger and slower final applications .
You 'll notice that I have a link from the C and C++ paragraphs to our courses ( we offer 2 in C - choose depending on whether you 've programmed before or not , and 3 in C++ depending on whether you 've programmed in C before , or programmed before in something else , or not programmed before ! ) , but we do NOT offer a C# course .
We have a whole lot of reasons why not - let me just start with ( a ) we do n't know the language well enough and ( b ) it 's a commercial language ( Microsoft's ) which does n't fit with our Open Source model .
Java v JavaScript
Java is a very well established , Object Oriented language with a wide variety of applications .
There are huge numbers of options , packages , technologies implemented in Java to the extent that it can become very confusing indeed - we offer courses on the language itself , on how it 's used on the server ( applets , servlets ) and how to deploy it on the server ( Tomcat ) .
JavaScript is a language that 's built into browsers - " DHTML " - which allows local programming capabilities , and you 'll find some examples on our web site .
We can provide some training , but we do n't offer a full formal public course as we do n't go in to JavaScript in enough depth ourselves .
JavaScript is also present / supported , server side , in .asp and .NET .
Other Similar names
PerlScript and Perl are the same language - the difference is more in the name than anything else , with the extra " script " being descriptive of how it works rather than in defining a different language .
We are pleased to train you on either
Jython is Python - implemented in Java rather than directly in C .
Which makes Jython ( which shares its syntax with Python - so ' same language ' ) an ideal language for run time / scripting changes , updates , tailoring of Java applications .
We are please to train you on either

Comparing Java Courses - what can we do ?
Related topics : via article database
In answer to the question " Graham - what options can you offer me for a course similar to [ gave me URL of an advanced server side Java course run by another training company , but not scheduled until late summer ] ? " from a potential course booker .
I replied ...
The description you have referred me to is a more advanced Java course that looks particularly at programming applications for use on a web server in Java , for delegates with prior Java experience in other fields .
These days , we find that most people who are using Java are using it on the web , and that a combined " Programming in Java for the Web " type course - which covers both Java and the web stuff - is more relevant ; there are relatively few delegates who know Java already , but need to add the web element .
So our published course schedule offers :
* Learning to program in Java - 5 days - covering basic programming principles , the Java language , and a somewhat lighter look at the advanced Servlet / JSP type course of the Learning Tree specification you sent me to compare to .
See http://www.wellho.net/course/sjfull.html .
This course is for delegates with no prior programming experience .
* Java Bootcamp - 4 days .
Covering the Java language , and the same somewhat lighter look at the Servlet / JSP subjects of the previous course .
See http://www.wellho.net/course/bjfull.html .
This course is for delegates who do have prior programming experience , but in a language other than Java .
* Apache httpd / Tomcat deployment - 2 days .
This course covers the running of web servers on which Java applications are running , and is n't a programming course at all - it's all about how to run servers that run third party written programs .
See http://www.wellho.net/course/atfull.html
How can we help delegates who already know Java , but need to add in the Server side skills ?
1 . We 've got the material / we can do this on private , tailored courses to match the exact needs of the client company .
That 's cost effective if there are three or more delegates to be trained at the same time - and that is often the case with Java , which is by nature a language that 's used on larger projects where there are multiple ( or even hordes of ) programmers .
2 . I would be willing to fill a gap in our schedule with a three day course covering this material that we already use on private courses - for experienced Java programmers , covering Servlets , the servlet life cycle , database access ( although that 's really a more general Java topic ) , maintaining state so that server requests can be linked into a complete application ( a.k.a. sessions ) .
JSPs , custom tags and the standard tag library , and an overview of Struts .
Also covering the design issues to make sure that applications are going to be easy to use / maintain / upgrade , and will be robust .
Please let me know if you 're interested in either of those options - the first one would vary in price depending on number of delegates and location , the second would be priced at 1030.00 +
VAT per delegate - that 's the residential cost at our Melksham , Wiltshire training centre including hotel room there for three nights .
If the delegate (s ) live in Wiltshire or nearby and can commute daily , the cost is 850.00 + VAT .
P.S. If it turns out that the delegates need to learn Java / are n't all that familiar with it , and the 4 day Java Bootcamp is right ... EXCEPT that they need to cover the Servlet and JSP topics in more detail , we can extend that course by 1 or 2 days ( 350.00 per extra day / 410.00 extra inc. room ) to cover that extra material .
Those days could follow directly on , or be after a short break .

C Programming v Learning to Program in C. Which course ?
Related topics : via article database Useful link : Java training
We offer two C courses - varying depending on the background of the delegates .
For delegates who have prior programming experience , our two day Programming in C course will help them convert from VB , or Perl or Java or Fortran or Cobol ... the course assumes a knowledge of programming techniques such as the use of variables , conditionals and loops , and the naming of blocks of code for re-use in what are know variously as " functions " , " subroutines " , " methods " or " procedures " .
For delegates who are new to programming , our three day Learning to Program in C course covers the background principles that I 've just mentioned above , and in the context of C programming , which is then followed on the second and third day by the same material as we cover on the C Programming course .
By offering two courses , we provide our delegates with a course that is far better tuned to their needs than a " one size fits all " course would do , and by joining the two courses together after the initial " learning to " day , we provide group interaction within the class for the benefit of all concerned - this use of an extra day on the front is something that we do with other languages that we teach too , and although it sometimes provides an element of questioning along the lines of " which course should I book ? " it does allow us to provide a course which is gentle enough for the newcomer , AND a course which is n't boringly slow for the experience programmer who 's converting .
If you 're looking for other programming languages , you 'll find we apply the same principle to PHP , Python , Ruby , lua , tcl , and Java .
In Perl , the two courses are combined from day 1 , and in C++ we offer a third course , which is even more advanced in its starting point - it's for those who have prior expericence in the C language which forms a part of C ++.
So
• Learning to program in C++ for newcomers to programming .
5 days .
• C and C++ programming for delegates with prior programming experience - but NOT in C. 4 days .
• C++ programming for delegate who are already C programmers , and who need to add C++ to their skills .
2 days .

MySQL - licensing issues , even with using the name
Related topics : via article database
MySQL is a really good database and it's been available for a very long time under an open source license - indeed this piece of text will be stored in a MySQL database when I 've added it to our web site using the Movable Type software , and pulled back from there using both Movable type software ( here ) , and also our own software ( here ) .
However , it has always been at the more commercial end of the Open Source movement , with tighter licensing conditions that most .
That was the background for MySQL drivers being withdrawn from PHP at release 5 of PHP ( if you want MySQL in release 5 of PHP , you have to download MySQL yourself , first , before you build as there 's not a bundle - we do this on our LAMP deployment and Web Server Deployment courses .
And that tighter license helped to add to the commercial value of the MySQL company which sold out about a year ago to Sun Microsystems for a reputed 1 billion dollars .
We 've just received an email from Google - and I 'm pretty sure it 's genuine - telling us that we can no longer use the keyword " MySQL " in our Adwords campaigns .
Because " MySQL " is a trademark .

Now that 's an interesting one !
I used to express an opinion that the MySQL folks had done their database a dis - service by having a license that restricted it so that it could no longer be part of the PHP distribution - in some quarters , the lack of the MySQL driver in the PHP distribution persuaded people NOT to upgrade / use a technology where two of the key element 's players could n't agree on a combined , Open Source download .
And that it did not bode very well for the future .
I may be wrong in that opinion as they seem to go from strength to strength and are probably ( I 've not got the commercial figures of course ) doing a good job in making more people purchase rather than use the open source version .
I 've plenty more to do than to do anything to fight to keep the MySQL as a Google keyword , and our model is open source , so I 'll be suggesting to Chris who looks after the various campaigns that we update ads like the one above to push our Lua ( on the most open of open source licenses , and also much more fun to teach as it's a language not a database ) and Ruby courses ...

Books and distance learning from Well House Consultants ?
Related topics : via article database Useful link : MySQL training
A question from my ask the tutor page which really deserves adding to an " FAQ " ... so I 'll publish the question and answer here
> Sender - Xxxx Xxxxxxxx ( xxxx@xxxxxxxxxxxxx.co.uk )
>
> via page - / course/index.html
> do you do any books or distance learning courses
Hi , Xxxx
Thanks for writing / asking .
The answer is " yes and no "
Bookwise , we do write and publish our own training notes to go with the courses , which are very thorough in what they cover , as they are designed to be useful to delegates after the course as well as * during * .
There are samples at http://www.wellho.net/downloads/ and there is a complete download of the Java course and a few others at http://www.training-notes.co.uk/
Trainingwise , we specialise in providing public courses at our own centre , and for groups we also provide private courses at our centre or private courses on your on site - so we could travel to your location .
However , we do n't run courses via video links or use the other distance learning techniques as most of our clients are looking for a short , intensive course with immediate recourse to the tutor who 's physically in the same location .
There * is* a market for online training , training CDs , etc , but that 's not quite the market we 're in and we would be spreading ourselves too thinly if we tried .
One of the things that we have just scheduled may be of interest to you , though , as it's rather different to the traditional course and is intended for the budget conscious trainee - perhaps working on a club or charity site , or for his own business where it would be a huge decision to go away for a few days during the week .
We 're doing a two day residential " PHP workshop " at the end of May bank holiday - arrival on the Friday evening , departure on Sunday evening ( or stay over to Monday morning if you want to see the area ;-) ) at a cost of 100 pounds per day ( + VAT ) - the hotel room being an extra 80.00 per night .
Please do let me know if that ( or anything similar ) would be attractive to you .
Graham
Footnote added to this published version ..
If you are interested in these weekend sessions - this first one being intended for people who know a bit of PHP but really want to make the best of it in their web site ... please ask .
You could do so by filling in the PHP - handled form here where we use captcha scripts to have you re-type a word to ensure you 're ' real ' something covered over that weekend along with many other topics !

Public transport across Wiltshire is truly appalling - after the 06:15 train from Swindon to Salisbury , there is n't another until 18:45 , and if you catch the bus or make a dogleg train journey via Bath or via Reading ( the two routes offered ) you 'll take the best part of two hours .
That really a pretty poor link between the county 's largest town and its city which are just 40 miles apart as the crow flies , and as the private car drives .
It 's not as if the train just passes through open countryside either - it " serves " the next three population centres of the county at Trowbridge , Chippenham and Melksham too .
We hear a lot about sustainable transport , and we hear a lot about encouraging the economy .
We also hear of traffic jams and of people having to look harder and pay more for parking .
And I was listening to a lecture recently where we were told of families dropping back from two cars to just one ...
Would n't it be a sensible time to put some appropriate trains BACK on the TransWilts line which is still very much there ( in fine condition ) and ready to take them !
The way it works is that the railways change their timetables in May and December each year ... we 're probably too late for May but we could be in time for December .
A huge amount of background work has already been done .
Timetable worked out .
Train and crews earmarked .
Financial options ( to seed for first years ) discussed .
A new announcement by Geoff Hoon , the transport secretary , will allow the improvements to be rolled into the next round of railwatch franchising to help safeguard them into the far future .
But it needs the final decision to be made .
The local transport authority in these parts is Wiltshire Council , who have been described as " pro road " .
They have various proposals out for the A350 at present , looking to rebuild / improve the best part of 20 miles over the next fifteen years ( and would need to do more than that if they wanted to deal with certain remaining bottlenecks ! ) .
For the cost of 20 yards , they could ' seed ' the rail service for a year - the government are happy for them to do so ( I was talking in person with Ben Bradshaw , MP , Minister for the South West about it last Saturday ) and First Great Western are willing to run the trains ( I was also talking with Mark Hopwood , the MD of First Great Western on the same day ) .
Wiltshire Council - unlike many other councils - were n't represented at that day 's event and looking through the " apology " list I can't even spot their name there ... so it 's my view that the profile of the case need to be brought rather more thoroughly to their attention .
We have local elections to Wiltshire Council coming up at the start of June .
Now is an excellent time to be in touch with them , to let the incumbents who are standing again know that we are looking - amongst other things - at decent , sustainable public transport , and want then to provide such .
We 're also lobbying the other parties ; it should not be party political , and I can confirm that the main alternative party has already budgeted for that " 20 yards " which would give us a decent service .
Another way of costing it is to say it 's 1 p per council tax bill per week .
Is it a good idea to cut travel time from Trowbridge to Swindon from 50 minutes to 35 ?
And to be able to leave the car behind ?
And to have the travel provided in an all - inclusive way that means that you do n't have to own a car to make the journey a practical commute ?
If you think so , please add your name to our pledge of support at www.transwilts.org.uk
Thank you !
P.S. If you want to know more before you add your name there are plenty of links from the page I have pointed you to ... and I and many others are happy to answer further questions !

Jmeter - a first test case
Related topics : via article database
Would you like to see how your web site performs under load ?
I mentioned ApacheBench ( ab ) in a recent post , but you can also use a tool like Jmeter .
And although Jmeter is written in and runs in Java , you can use it to look at the performance of other servers and network resources too .
In famous " Blue Peter " jargon , ' here is one I put in the oven earlier ' ...
... and the reason I put one in the oven earlier is because like all things Java , the documentation and setup looks very complicated at first .
How did I set this up ?
0 . I fired up Jmeter - previously downloaded and unpacked - making sure that a Sun JRE was ' top dog ' in my PATH .
1. I started a new TEST PLAN
2. I added a THREAD GROUP
( 4 users , 4 seconds ramp up , 200 loops )
3 . I added an HTTP REQUESTS DEFAULT within Config Element
( wellho. net as the server but please use your own if you 're following this ! )
4 . I added an HTTP REQUEST within Samplers
( path to /robots. txt )
5 . I added a GRAPH RESULTS under listener
6 . I saved the configuration as a .jmx file ( robots.jmx )
and I chose " run " ...
Let me fill you in on those results .
There were 800 samples taken as I asked for 200 sets of 4 samples , and I spread the sample sets out over 4 seconds apiece , so the total run time was about 3 minutes .
The sprinkling of black dots represent the individual samples and how long each of them took , with the blue line showing the average time and the purple line showing the median ( time of the 50 percentile sample , which is a little bit different ) .
The red and green lines are on different scales - the red line showing the deviation or variance which was high at first ( probably because the first few samples would have been slow , the later samples consistently faster ) and the green lines shows the throughput achieved - that starts low and rises , again because of early slow samples .
Right .
Here is a stern lesson .
Do NOT run Jmeter against a server that you do n't own / do n't have permission to try it out on .
Tests like the one I have done above are cruel and can bring a server to its knees very quickly , so using Jmeter is a way to make yourself very unpopular !
BUT if you 're configuring a new environment it's a great tool !
I have only started to scratch the surface here ... as you put your first test plan together , follow what I have done on your own server .... and as you put your second plan together , have a look at the manual that covers it from Apache - in particular chapter 5 - here .
You 'll find it 's very clever in terms of logging in , posted data , handling cookies and doing a lot more to simulate real traffic .
Proceed further and you 'll find that you can combine thread groups that are being run by different instances of Jmeter into a single report , and get some very sophisticated load testing running .

Connecting jconsole remotely - the principles
Related topics : via article database
BEWARE - this first is a " shows you how " and is insecure ...
I am doing the demo this way because the security requirements add various issues that would complicate the first demonstration of principle .
1 . Set up your SERVER to allow jmx remote connections on an otherwise unused port - we have done this by changing the Java options in the catalina.sh script - around line 188 in version 6.0.18 ( ahead of the comment shown below ) I added 2 lines :
JAVA_OPTS=" $JAVA_OPTS - Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=9876
"
JAVA_OPTS=" $ JAVA_OPTS - Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false "
JAVA_OPTS=" $ JAVA_OPTS - Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false "
# ----- Execute The Requested Command --------------------------
2. Restart the server via that catalina.sh script
3 . Start the jconsole monitor
jconsole 192.168.200.215:9876
Now ... you should go back and add authenticated users ... lots of instructions available - here are some URLs to start you !

Using ApacheBench and jconsole to test and monitor Tomcat
Related topics : via article database
jconsole lets you monitor Tomcat or another Java application so that you can see how much memory is in use , how many threads you have running , how many classes , etc .
Here 's an example of a Tomcat server that was sitting virtually unused ... which we then exercised through ApacheBench - the ab utility that 's supplied with Apache httpd , as follows :
ab -n 2000 -c 30 http://192.168.200.215:8080/whm_course/demo.jsp
That 's calling for a page to be loaded 2,000 times - with a concurrency of 30 ( in other words for there to be 30 connections all at the same time , simulating visits from 30 different places .
Not surprisingly , the effect of sending 30 concurrent requests was that Tomcat started another 30 threads to handle them (! ) and those threads between them grabbed anothe4 4 Mbyes or so of memory .
The cpu usage spiked to around 20 % .
What is interesting to note is that - once created - the threads live on in case further requests come in .

Java - Memory Allocation and garbage collection
Related topics : via article database
When you 're running a dynamic application ( and most of the languages we teach these days are dynamic ) , memory is allocated and released as necessary at run time , with allocation happening ' as required ' and being released from time to time by a garbage collector - there is no point is collecting a few bytes of memory every time that there is some released as that would be very inefficient - rather like calling out your local council to collect your rubbish every time you finished a packet of crisps .
So if you look at a graph of memory usage , you 'll see a saw - toothed shape like this :
In Java , data ( objects ) are held in memory in different areas , and moved around between them , to make the memory management and garbage collection more efficient , and the memory areas each have their own names .
New objects are allocated memory in the Eden Space memory pool ( as in created in Eden ) and by the nature of most applications in which the majority of objects only survive for a short while , that 's where they remain for their short lives .
Here is a graph showing the size of Eden Space alone - you 'll notice the same general saw toothed shape , but the curve drops virtually to zero at the base of every tooth :
At minor garbage collection time , objects which survive garbage collection are moved to the Survivor Space which , as the name implies , is used for objects that have a longer life span / expectancy .
Here 's a graph of survivor space - you 'll see some gentle ups and downs but in general a much smoother curve !
And that minority of objects that are n't going to be going away but are ' around for the duration ' become a part of the Tenure space .
I would n't describe the graph for tenure as a curve - more like a straight line !
All four sample graphs are taken from jconsole , monitoring a Tomcat server that 's ticking over with just a few test connections / pages being served .
There are also other memory pools used and shown by jconsole - there 's the code cache where the code that 's being run - both Tomcat itself and the classes it is running - resides , and you have permanent areas too - one " rw " ( read / write ) and one that is " ro " ( read only ) .
The code cache graph looks somewhere between the survivor and tenure in shape :
And the permanent areas are close to being flat files ( I have n't reproduced them here ! )

A lot has changed - but the memory lingers on
Related topics : via article database Useful link : Java training
I got an email from a delegate I trained ten years ago - which goes to show just how long a week of training can be remembered .
He wrote " I was trying to figure out how to return EOF in Java when Google showed site Well House .
Well , I could n't remember where I learned Perl but now I do !
Sometime in 99 I took one of your Perl courses - which in fact did turn out to be exactly what I needed . "
It 's good to hear from people after all these years - it helps complete the loop and make it feel all that much more worthwhile knowing that people learn not only for the short but the medium and long term too .
But - my goodness - a lot of water has flowed under the bridge in ten years !
I 'll share my answer ... and help fill in any other past delegates who should stumble across our pages ... it 's a small world after all
In " 99 " , we were running our own Perl courses under contract at First Alternative who in those days had a training centre ( since closed ) at Harwell in Oxfordshire .
In 2000 , we opened our own training centre in Melksham , Wiltshire - initially for our Perl and Java courses , but we rapidly added Tcl , and since then other languages too , most notably ( in terms of business volume ! )
Python and PHP .
We 've specialised in the REALLY niche stuff , so that most of our delegates travel a long way to our courses - and that means that some 80 % of delegates also want overnight accommodation - so in 2006 , we expanded / opened a new training centre / hotel , where we now run all of our public courses .
And we 're teaching Linux , web server deployment , Lua , Ruby and MySQL - also C and C++ - in addition to those subjects mentioned above .
Then we found that people coming to Melksham , or to visit Bath , like to stay with us because we 're a full hotel ... and people want to hire our training rooms to run their own courses ... and we 're now something of a 24 x 7 business !
I may be wrong ... but some vague bell tells me that you were with Oxford University of based near there .
If I have committed the ultimate sin of mixing up my Oxfords and Cambridges - oops - I expect you 'll forgive me .
Did you get your Java " eof " sorted ?
The answer will depend on what method you 're using on what type of object ;-) .... with chance being that it will be a cardinal number like - 1 , a false , or an exception chucked back at you .
Please do let me know if you are not resolved and I 'll have a proper look within 24 hours - there 's no limit to how long I like to help past students .
In fact - I started a blog back in 2004 and I post useful answers such as this up there ... please do have a look at http://www.wellho.net/horse - for " The Horse 's Mouth " .
And if you fancy a weekend away in Wiltshire , do come down and stay at the hotel ... you can refer to the library of around 700 books ( 100 on Java , 100 on Perl ) and we can catch up on old times .
Oh - the hotel web site is http://www.wellhousemanor.co.uk and past delegates can stay at the weekend at a special price of 70 pounds per room per night ;-)
Anyway - let me know if you need a hand with the Java , and if you 're down our way ( but not looking to stay ) put in for a coffee .
Good to hear from you !

Why put Apache httpd in front of Apache Tomcat
Related topics : via article database
Does it seem odd to you that Apache Tomcat is a web server ... and yet the majority of sites run with another web server - Apache httpd - in front of it .
Why do they do it ?
There 's a whole host of reasons !
They including better logging , load balancing , security , speed of serving static pages such as images , allowing other ( non - Java ) content to work efficiently on the same domain , more configuration flexibility and so on .
I sometimes describe Tomcat as being like an aircraft that will get you from " a " to " b " .... but very few people actually want to go from " a " to " b " - they want to go from somewhere 20 miles from " a " to somewhere 40 miles from " b " , so the need something else to complete the journey - a car , or httpd .
So we offer two web server courses - there 's a course that covers Apache httpd alone - the majority of non-Java sites run with that server , and a course that covers Apache Tomcat , and also some Apache httpd and how the two interface - which suits that majority of Apache Tomcat users .
Both courses are two days in duration - the ' pure httpd ' one covering Apache httpd in a lot more detail that the combined course , where httpd is more likely to be used as a wrapper rather than a significantly configured workhorse .

A New Advert for Well House Manor
Related topics : via article database
Who are our hotel customers at Well House Manor ?
We have several distinct groups , and the question comes " how do we arrange our advertising to suit them all ? " ... we really do n't want guests who are visiting Melksham to attend a wedding at the weekend or meet up with family to be put of by our " business hotel " approach , nor do we want our business guests to think that we 're just a leisure destination .
The Melksham Independent News is a well read local paper - distributed to many thousands of homes , and our advert in there ( at least ) can clearly tell the leisure visitors what we offer ... thus the advert above .
We 're delighted to welcome people touring the area , coming to weddings in Wiltshire , visiting their relatives in town - there 's absolutely no requirement for them to have any association with a local company .
If you 're looking for a quiet place , slightly luxurious rooms , freedom to come and go as you please without the feeling that you 're putting the landlord out as you come back after midnight ... we may be the place for you .
If you 're looking for somewhere you can retreat away from the hub - bub of kids ( we have a minimum guest age of 14 ) and perhaps have a ' second honeymoon ' ... we may be the place for you .
And if you do n't usually sleep well when you 're away from home - you want a soft bed , a spacious shower , and a library of books and DVDs ... we may be the place for you .

Supporting Parkinsons and Trains
Related topics : via article database
Duncan Hames , our " Lib - Dem " candidate for the new Chippenham / Melksham / Bradford - on - Avon seat at the next election , is a keen supporter of our campaign to provide an appropriate train service across Wiltshire ... he 's pictured here at the station the other week .
And he 's braver than me - he 's running in the Bath Half Marathon this Sunday - seeking sponsorship on behalf of the Parkinson 's Society , brought about by a familiy connection .
We get lots of requests for support and sponsorship , and there 's only a tiny proportion we can take up - but this is one that I do , willingly support and I 'm sure that Duncan would welcome you supporting him too - see his further details and sponsorship page .
He say the run wo n't be pretty - I 'll leave you to look at his picture on that page and decide for yourself .
Come the next general election ... and I 'm going to be in the unusual position of having met the candidates for all three major parties , and for more than just a handshake .
And I 've got a great deal of admiration and respect for all three of them personally ; it 's going to be a difficult voting choice .
And all three of them personally support an appropriate train service .
Of course , one 's not just voting for the person but for the party and policies too , and I can't help noticing that it was the current Labour Administration that cut the local train service to the current absurd setup in the first place , and the Wiltshire Tory Local Transport Authority who are very detached from providing financial support , whilst ploughing millions into proposals for roads which will be used by private cars ( and not even buses ) .
A decent train service up to the end of the current franchise would cost about as much as 50 yards of road

Weekday or Weekend PHP , Python and Perl classes ?
Related topics : via article database
Should we run training courses during the week , or at weekends ?
Our ' traditional ' business has been 80 % + employees of companies , government organisations and educational establishments who have wanted weekday courses , with the remaining fifth being independents and contractors who are somewhat flexible , but see weekend courses as a bonus as they 're able to learn in what is their customer 's non-prime time .
Our ' traditional ' business has also been in training delegates with a little programming background ( at the least ) in converting them ... from Cobol to Perl , from VB to PHP or from Matlab to Python .
But we 're seeing changes - brought on by dynamic web sites moving from the specialist to the more general , brought on by people having more time and bringing dynamic web sites more into the hobby / club / new career line , and brought on by people with little IT experience taking on the roles formerly occupied by specialists who have now moved ( or been moved ) on .
So there 's a need for us to be able to train Learning to program in PHP as well as PHP Programming .
So we 've added a " Learning to ... " day in front of most of our programming language courses - where delegates who are new to computer programming ( or almost so ) can learn some of the fundamental principles and learn them as they relate to their target language .
These days mean that newcomers get a flying start - typically with a one - on - one day , helping them get up to speed for the main course , with demonstrations and practicals written to suit their particular needs .
And we have decided to add the extra days - in many cases - directly in front of the main ( Monday starting ) course , which puts the extra day on a Sunday .
There 's no ' right ' solution here , but we have done it this way because :
a) It leaves the main course on weekdays
b) It reduces the working days that learners are out of their office
c ) It avoids blocking the week with sparse training days
d ) It allows a continuity from a learning day onto the main course
With 80 % of delegates still ' converting ' , I expect these " Learning to " days to be sporadic in when they run ( this is where our guarantee that once you have booked , we wo n't cancel is so important to you ) ... but they are scheduled now for the rest of the year .
Learning to Program in C - 25th March
Learning to Program in Python - 29th March
Learning to Program in PHP - 19th April
Also ... Learning to Program in Lua , Learning to Program in Ruby , Learning to Program in Tcl , Learning to Program in C++ and Learning to Program in Perl ... click on the individual topic for desctiption and dates .
If you 're looking to learn but must have weekdays ONLY ... or if you want a weekend ONLY set of sessions ... please email me , and we 'll do our best to help .
The illustration that accompanies this article shows our guests at Breakfast - we provide a complete residential course where that 's required - and we find that the discussions on the subject that we 're teaching start over breakfast and continue into the evening - sometimes mixed with football , politics and other subjects too !

Extra PHP Examples
Related topics : via article database Useful links : Python training
Yesterday evening and this morning , I was helping with some specific PHP questions ... resulting in some new examples that I 've put on the web site .
• A program which can be used / allows logins only between 3 pm and 5 pm on a Wednesday afternoon ( and could easily be adapted to let people in at breakfast time on Fridays instead )
Demo and source
• A simple session demonstration , which allows and controls logins ... if you log in with user name " terry " and password " trotter " you can try it out .
Demo and source code for main page and source code for form generator
• And finally , and example of how you should ( and Should NOT ) echo large chunks of HTML from your PHP program ...
I feel really sad when I see a book with loads of echo statements all down one side of the example , when a " here document " or an exit from PHP mode would be so much cleaner .
The illustration is photographed from one of the books in our library , and shows the way constant text output should NOT be done .
It makes my toes curl !
Run the code and see the source
Aside from these examples , I 've added two more articles that relate to the session - the first is about how to set up a MySQL database through PHP and the second covers those vital ancillaries such as Usability , maintainability , and keeping the user in mind .
There is a lot - an awful lot - more to PHP that just this sprinkling of issues - these are just the ones that have come up in the last 24 hours , and for one particular person .
If you 're new to PHP , have a look at our PHP course ; if you 've got some PHP background but want to go further making real use of the power of the language , consider our PHP techniques workshop instead .

Copyright , Portability and other nontechnical web site issues
Related topics : via article database Useful link : PHP training
Sometimes , I get so enmeshed in the technical that it 's good to take a step back and look at our web site ( and web sites in general ) and say " what do we need to consider in the broader picture " .
I had this opportunity yesterday evening , as I ran a short session to look at some PHP issues .
A couple of broader questions ... for you to consider about your site ...
What do we need to consider as well as the code ?
Copyright
Do we have a copyright statement ?
Do we own copyright on all the images and any text we have copied and pasted on to the site ?
Do we have permission from the people who we show or quote to show or quote them ?
Browser Portability
We 've developed the site on Internet Explorer .
Does it work on Firefox and other browsers too ?
How does it look on a reduced size screen ?
Does it print nicely - and does it print nicely on both European and American paper sizes ?
Security
Is it open to injection attacks ?
Can submissions of inappropriate material be easily made to the site ?
Do we have any data files which have accidentally been given URLs ?
Findability
How easy are we to find through the search engines ?
Do we have URLs which will make our pages stand out ?
Are we found on the correct terms ?
When people arrive at our site , do they arrive at an appropriate page ?
Do our URLs remain unaltered so that search engines will continue to send people to pages that continue to exist ?
Maintainability If
When something has to be changed , how easy will it be ?
Can we add an extra box onto a form , an extra page into a navigable set , an extra validation check into a user entry and have that change be consistently applied once it's been written and tested a single time ?
Can we avoid ending up with a mish - mash of different fonts , colours and look - and - feels ?
Usability
Do people find what they want on our web site ?
And if they do , is it in a form that they can make the use of it that they want ?
Disability Discrimination
Is our site accessible to those with various disabilities - people who require larger text , people who are colour blind ( that 's 8 % of males in this country ) , people who are dyslexic , and people who require the text to be provided in shorter blocks ?
Who is [ this ] web site for ?
That 's a big question ... which I 've answered with regard to our web site .
Prospective Delegates ...
Start at our public course schedule or at details of private courses at our centre or at your office
Current Delegates ... will find all the examples on their course under the course schedule [ example ]
Perl Programming , and updated notes indexed on The Horse 's Mouth .
Past Delegates ... will find the source code of all the training course examples , plus technical articles , sorted training module by training module .
There 's a full module index for you to start from .
Hotel Guests ... are catered for by our Well House Manor web site , which has appropriate links back and forth .
Technical questioners ... should land on the subject that 's of interest to them - for example Using MySQL databases from PHP .
There 's also a technical subject index available .
Staff ... have a common page here which contains all the critical information we need to access rapidly ; if you visit the page , though , you 'll only see limited information whereas we see the status of the hotel rooms , who is signed in on duty , notes back and forth between the staff , and an indicator as to what our front door greeting screen is saying .
Friends and family ... can keep updated via The Horse 's Mouth where a proportion of articles will be " newsy " rather than technical and ...
Community Interest
Where individual interests / groups with which we are concerned can start .
We have Melksham Chamber of Commerce diary and news , we have the First Great Western Coffeeshop , and we we have the obscure like the Larkhill Military Railway at Druid 's Lodge and Ratfyn Junction .

Setting up a MySQL database from PHP
Related topics : via article database
Yes ... training on a Sunday ;-) ... I 've been setting up a MySQL database from a PHP script and testing it .
A couple of bits of source to share .
1 . The setup of the database :
<? php
mysql_connect ( " localhost " , " womble " , " wimbledon " ) ;
mysql_query ( " create database gerald " ) ;
mysql_select_db(" gerald " ) ;
mysql_query ( " create table course ( first text , second text ) " ) ;
mysql_query ( ' insert into course values ( " Upper " , " Lower " ) ' ) ;
mysql_query ( ' insert into course values ( " Smiff " , " Yones " ) ' ) ;
?>
2 . A page to test that it 's there :
<? php
mysql_connect ( " localhost " , " womble " , " wimbledon " ) ;
mysql_select_db(" gerald " ) ;
$rs = mysql_query ( " select * from course " ) ;
while ( $ rown = mysql_fetch_assoc( $rs ) ) {
$ html .= " $rown [ first ] ... $ rown [ second ] < br > " ;
}
?>
< html >
< body >
Here it is < br >
<?= $ html ?>
</ body >
</html >
( We had to set it up this way as there is only FTP access to the server ... learn more about these things on our PHP courses and MySQL courses

Converting to Perl - the sort of programs you will write
Related topics : via article database Useful links : PHP training
I 've put many of the examples that I wrote during last week 's Perl Course into our converting to Perl resource , and they 've available for use and download from there , subject to the usual " use at your own risk " exclusion !
Where delegates are used to prescriptive , declared languages such as Cobol ( or being more modern , Java ! ) , the Perl ethoses of ' Perl assumes you know what you are doing " and ' you do n't need to tell Perl - it can work it out ' and 'if you leave out a variable name , it may assume $ _ ' can cause a considerable degree of consternation and be quite hard to accept - after all , they have always been taught to remain in their seat until the aircraft comes to a complete halt , and the idea of getting up at 2500 feet and jumping out is alien to them , however safe the parachute of Perl might be , and however much quicker they 'll get home by jumping out and landing in their own back garden rather than carrying on to some London airport from where they have to get land transport back home .
There 's a wide variety of examples in that directory , then ... let me give you some tasters and you can then explore further ...
• [ link ] to documentation and documentation comment example .
With such a freeflow language as Perl , it 's vital for you to comment it well and also provide user documentation .
• [ link ] to an example that uses list processing ; in Perl , there are many occasions where you do n't need to write code to process every elememt of a list - built in functions do the looping for you resulting in shorter and faster running code
• [ link ] to a context example .
Languages like English use ' context ' to add sense to works .
If I write " Reading is a ... " , you wo n't know if I 'm referring to the town or the skill until I add the next work ... " Thames side " will tell you it 's a town and " useful " will imply that it 's probably the skill .
Perl supports context too - you 'll see different behaviours is some thing 's used as a scalar , as a list , as a string within double quotes , or as an integer .
• [ link ] to a ' live ' web log file analysis example .
This example uses many of the fundamental Perl elements ( list , hashes , regular expressions and more ) for the rapidly wr
Are Alan Greenspan 's new ideas better than the old ?
“ All of the sophisticated mathematics and computer wizardry essentially rested on one central premise : that enlightened self interest of owners and managers of financial institutions would lead them to maintain a sufficient buffer against insolvency by actively monitoring and managing their firms ’ capital and risk positions , ” the Fed chairman said .
The premise failed in the summer of 2007 , he said , leaving him “ deeply dismayed . ”
Self - regulation is still a first - line of defense , Mr. Greenspan said .
But after the financial collapse of 2007 and 2008 , “ I see no alternative to a set of heightened federal regulatory rules of behavior for banks and other financial institutions . ”
ALAN GREENSPAN 's reputation has n't fared particularly well in recent years .
Once heralded as the orchestrator of rapid growth and the master of the business cycle , Mr Greenspan is now seen as the progenitor of a failed theory of central banking , and the last man to recognise the troubling nature of the housing bubble .
But as John Hilsenrath notes ( via Mark Thoma ) the maestro's outlook is changing :
And Mr Greenspan has also told the Financial Times that it may be time to nationalise :
It may be necessary to temporarily nationalise some banks in order to facilitate a swift and orderly restructuring ... I understand that once in a hundred years this is what you do .
Given his record , should this encourage us to feel more favourably or less favourably toward nationalisation ?

Materials
Lays Stacks ( my preferance , holds up better ) / Pringles potato chip can
Foam rubber
Condom
1 1/4'' o-ring
Scissors
Marker Procedure
Empty the chips out of the can .
You can use whatever brand and flavor you prefer , but we like the one shown here for the container ’s ergonomic shape and durable , colorful plastic .
Lay out the foam and trim to fit the length of the container if necessary .
The length of the foam can be up to a half inch longer than the length of the can .
Unroll the condom and drop the O-ring inside .
If you use a lubricated condom , turn it inside out first , so the lube is on the inner surface .
Lay the condom along the foam with the open end slightly above the edge , and mark across where the O-ring lays in the condom .
Cut the foam into two pieces along this line .
Roll up the smaller piece of foam and push it into the bottom of the can .
Lay the condom against the shorter edge of the other piece of foam so that the tip and the O-ring are hanging over one end and the open top of the condom is hanging over the other .
Roll up the foam with the condom inside .
The O -ring should be flat against one end of the foam roll , and the top of the condom should be sticking out of the center of the other end .
With the scissors , make a nick in the tip of the condom , just enough so some air can get through .
Insert the foam roll into the chip container , making sure the open end of the condom stays above the top of the foam .
Leave about ½ ” of foam above the rim of the can .
Use a nail or screwdriver to poke a small hole on the side of the can near the bottom .
Optional : If desired , use a pink or red marker to draw a vagina or lips on the foam around the center hole before covering the foam with the condom .
Carefully stretch the condom around the rim of the can and over the lip so it covers the foam .
The lip of the can will hold the condom in place .
To use your homemade flashlight toy , squirt some water - based , non-greasy lube into the condom and insert your penis .
Cover the hole in the can with the tip of your finger to control the amount of “ suction ” you get .
Closing the hole will increase the suction , so leave it open as you stroke in , and cover it on the out stroke .
Remove the foam roll and replace the condom after use ( or rinse and reuse , if you ’re really cheap , I know I am . ) .
Use a textured condom turned inside out for more stimulation .
Because the condom has a small opening on the end , the foam at the bottom of the can will periodically need to be replaced .

When stored with the lid on , the homemade flashlight can be conveniently camouflaged as an innocent can of potato chips ( the can on the left has an advantage because its lid is opaque ) ..
However , you need to release the edge of the condom from the lip of the can before you put the top on .
If the condom is stretched around the top when you put the lid on , the lid will cut through the thin rubber of the condom .
Leave the top of the condom loose , push the foam in , and cover with the lid .
To use , just pop the top , pull the foam out a bit , and restretch the rubber .

Small talk is lonely and obsessed with fleshlights , and I 'm bored and all of my threads have sucked so far .
So here we go .
None of these items are individually bannable , so I 'm hoping they are n't bannable combined as one .
Empty the chips out of the can .
You can use whatever brand and flavor you prefer , but we like the one shown here for the container ’s ergonomic shape and durable , colorful plastic .
Lay out the foam and trim to fit the length of the container if necessary .
The length of the foam can be up to a half inch longer than the length of the can .
Unroll the condom and drop the O-ring inside .
If you use a lubricated condom , turn it inside out first , so the lube is on the inner surface .
Lay the condom along the foam with the open end slightly above the edge , and mark across where the O-ring lays in the condom .
Cut the foam into two pieces along this line .
Roll up the smaller piece of foam and push it into the bottom of the can .
Lay the condom against the shorter edge of the other piece of foam so that the tip and the O-ring are hanging over one end and the open top of the condom is hanging over the other .
Roll up the foam with the condom inside .
The O -ring should be flat against one end of the foam roll , and the top of the condom should be sticking out of the center of the other end .
With the scissors , make a nick in the tip of the condom , just enough so some air can get through .
Insert the foam roll into the chip container , making sure the open end of the condom stays above the top of the foam .
Leave about ½ ” of foam above the rim of the can .
Use a nail or screwdriver to poke a small hole on the side of the can near the bottom .
Optional : If desired , use a pink or red marker to draw a vagina or lips on the foam around the center hole before covering the foam with the condom .
Carefully stretch the condom around the rim of the can and over the lip so it covers the foam .
The lip of the can will hold the condom in place .
To use your homemade flashlight toy , squirt some water - based , non-greasy lube into the condom and insert your penis .
Cover the hole in the can with the tip of your finger to control the amount of “ suction ” you get .
Closing the hole will increase the suction , so leave it open as you stroke in , and cover it on the out stroke .
Remove the foam roll and replace the condom after use ( or rinse and reuse , if you ’re really cheap , I know I am . ) .
Use a textured condom turned inside out for more stimulation .
Because the condom has a small opening on the end , the foam at the bottom of the can will periodically need to be replaced .

WHAT should we do to minimise the harm cannabis can cause to the health and welfare of users and to society at large ?
One answer , according to a report by a group of prominent academics and government advisers , is to change the law to allow the state to prepare and distribute the drug for recreational use .

We recently updated the PC version of Left 4 Dead with some exploit fixes and Versus balancing .
We are going to be releasing another small update later today that contains some server issue fixes and one small , but very large , gameplay adjustment .
We have made a change to the melee mechanic in Versus and the soon - to - be- released Survival Mode .
Xbox 360 users will see these same gameplay changes in an update coming out with the DLC  which , in case you missed the announcement , will be coming out April 21st .
As we continue to work on Left 4 Dead , our plan is to release more frequently on the PC , and then group those updates for the 360 .
With the upcoming release of the SDK , and the community servers already available on the PC , matchmaking is one place where the two platforms will diverge .
A future blog post will detail our roadmap for PC matchmaking .
Game statistics help us evaluate the success of the changes we 've made to the game .
In Versus , for example , we flipped the order in which teams play the next round based on who was winning the round before it .
We were confident this would help to better balance the game and give neither team a lasting advantage .
That would , in turn , translate into more people playing through the final maps .
Since making that change , we 've noticed the percentage of games being played to the end jump 5 % .
It is a small increase , but a step in the right direction .
But statistics are only part of the picture .
We also use direct feedback from players themselves .
One of the questions people ask is if we read the forums : the answer is yes .
So please post your feedback on the melee and other changes as we make them .
We promise to keep listening to your feedback , making changes and improving the gameplay experience of Left 4 Dead .
Remember :
If you do n't see an issue addressed with this update , that does n't mean it is n't coming .

A few years ago President George W. Bush launched a war in Iraq .
He called for bipartisan support for his actions and Americans responded regardless of political affiliation , often even if they disagreed with the war itself .
Last week President Obama won a hard - fought victory in the House , which passed a bill to create an economic stimulus .
Obama also had appealed to Americans to put aside their political differences and put the public ’s needs first .
Result : Not one Republican voted for this needed legislation , and the people did nothing .
Conservative goofs such as Rush Limbaugh , right - wing bloggers and others suggest that this bill supports socialist agendas — this after the ridiculous giveaways to the banks .
One Republican politician said last week on MSNBC that he cannot support this bill because it gives too much of the money to people who always spend whatever they get .
Do you wonder why we are seeing the decline of America ?
It may sound socialistic , but it is up to the people to make the difference .
While people are losing their jobs , right - wingers are more concerned with regaining their power .
AUSTRALIA'S initiative to drive a new round of nuclear disarmament talks has met with a receptive ear in the Obama Administration , which is likely to give the running on the issue to Vice - President Joe Biden , according to Australia 's chief negotiator on the issue , former foreign minister Gareth Evans .
After years of stalling by nations around the world , Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced last year he wanted Australia to lead the debate on reducing nuclear arsenals and ensuring that the new Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , due to be negotiated in 2010 , had real teeth .
He appointed Mr Evans as co-chair of the International Commission on Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament , an Australian initiative being co-chaired by Japan .
After a shaky start , it now looks likely that the Australian initiative could yield real results , following the change of US administration .
" We have a very serious level of buy - in , " Mr Evans said after high - level meetings in Washington on Friday and Saturday .
EXCLUSIVE :
President Obama ’s executive order closing CIA “ black sites ” contains a little - noticed exception that allows the spy agency to continue to operate temporary detention facilities abroad .
The provision illustrates that the president ’s order to shutter foreign - based prisons , known as black sites , is not airtight and that the Central Intelligence Agency still has options if it wants to hold terrorist suspects for several days at a time .
Current and former U.S. officials , who spoke on the condition that they are n’t identified because of the sensitivity of the subject , said such temporary facilities around the world will remain open , giving the administration the opportunity to seize and hold assumed terrorists .
The detentions would be temporary .
Suspects either would be brought later to the United States for trial or sent to other countries where they are wanted and can face trial .
The exception is evidence that the new administration , while announcing an end to many elements of the Bush “ war on terror , ” is leaving itself wiggle room to continue some of its predecessor ’s practices regarding terrorist suspects .
According to the executive order , “ The terms ‘ detention facilities ’ and ‘ detention facility ’ in section 4 ( a ) of this order do not refer to facilities used only to hold people on a short - term , transitory basis . ”
Analysts inside and outside government say this refers to so - called safe houses , which are buildings where operatives can go to protect themselves from pursuers or can hide people they have taken into custody .
“ This executive order does not close down all operations .
There are still facilities on a temporary basis , often called safe houses , for holding someone for a matter of days , ” an administration official said .
Ken Gude , the associate director of international rights and responsibilities at the Center for American Progress , said the temporary facilities operated by the CIA should not be confused with the Bush administration ’s black sites .
“ My understanding is that these types of temporary facilities can be in no way described as a prison , ” Mr. Gude said .
“ They are temporary holding facilities that the CIA has used in the past for decades , … often parts of exchange agreements with other foreign intelligence agencies . ”
“ For example , we may have an agreement with the Pakistanis , where we agree to pick someone up and we need a place to hold them temporarily while we decide what is the next appropriate course of action , ” he said .
“ This is not like the so - called black site prisons that we heard about as part of the extraordinary rendition program . ”
Michael Kraft , a former senior adviser at the Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism at the State Department , said the temporary facilities could be used for any number of reasons .
“ A scenario might be , someone is picked up in country X , and maybe for logistics reasons , we hold him somewhere else , while a plane with larger fuel tanks is prepared to take him to his final destination , ” said Mr. Kraft , who retired in 2004 .
Duane Clarridge , who founded the CIA ’s Counterterrorism Center , said the temporary facilities may be used for interrogations .
“ It seems to me that they will take down terrorist suspects , bring them to a safe house , which is acquired on a temporary basis and controlled by the CIA or the military , where they interrogate the suspect over a period of days before making a decision on future disposition .
“ We do n’t know what that is ; it could be a variety of things .
It could be turn him over to the country of origin , or for standing trial in a third country , or release , ” Mr. Clarridge said .
The practice of moving terrorist suspects abroad , called rendition , began during the Reagan administration and escalated under President Clinton .
After the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks , the Bush administration began classifying terrorist suspects as enemy combatants and holding them indefinitely without formal charges or the protections afforded prisoners of war under the Geneva Conventions .
The closure of black - site prisons by Mr. Obama was part of a series of orders issued last week that included closing the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , and other measures to undo the previous administration ’s war on terrorism .
The president revoked all executive directives issued by the CIA between Sept. 11 , 2001 , and Jan. 20 , 2009 , that have been used to justify harsh interrogation techniques , which critics have called torture .
Mr. Obama also revoked Executive Order 13440 , which declares al Qaeda and Taliban fighters to be “ enemy combatants ” and therefore not protected by the Geneva Conventions .
The CIA practiced rendition before Sept. 11 , 2001 , and in some cases sent suspected terrorists to countries where human rights groups have claimed they were tortured .
The issue of rendition will be one of the policies studied by a Cabinet - level special task force on interrogation and transfer policies .
While the CIA operated special prisons overseas for high - value al Qaeda and Taliban detainees , the agency holds no such detainees in custody today , two U.S. officials said .
The last person in the CIA detention program was Muhammed Rahim , purported to be a driver for Mullah Mohammed Omar , the leader of the Taliban that governed Afghanistan until being overthrown in a U.S. - led invasion shortly after Sept. 11 .
Rahim was transferred to the Guantanamo Bay prison on March 14 , 2008 .
One of the two officials , when asked about the executive order Tuesday , said : “ The wording seems to preserve the ability to capture terrorists .
But long - term detention by the CIA is out . ”
The loophole for safe houses worries the American Civil Liberties Union , which has pressed for the closing of Guantanamo Bay and the black sites .
“ This is a place where what we all understood to be the CIA ’s secret prison system with prisons in places like Poland and Thailand is shut down here , and there is no future detention authority to operate those facilities , ” said Christopher Anders , senior legislative counsel for the ACLU .
“ But there is a provision on some kind of short - term detention authority , and our position is that the CIA should have no detention authority , ” Mr. Anders said .
“ If President Obama has taken the CIA out of the prison business , he should also take the CIA out of the short - term jailer business as well . ”

Massachusetts Wants Residents to Pay Sales Tax …For Purchases in Tax Free New Hampshire
Massachusetts , like many other states , is in a financial crisis .
But Governor Patrick has come up with a scheme to fleece Massachusetts taxpayers a little more .
He is trying to demand that a store in New Hampshire charge Massachusetts residents the Massachusetts sales tax .
This is just going too damn far .
Currently this is being attempted on just one business , the Town Fair Tire Centers , but if this is allowed to happen it will not end there .
Massachusetts has ordered a tire chain to charge Bay State residents a 5 percent sales tax on their purchases in New Hampshire in an unprecedented move that could have huge implications for consumers and other merchants .
Governor Patrick is desperate to raise more revenue to pay for his outlandish spending and he does n’t like his subjects traveling over the border where they can get a better deal .
In tough economic times you would think that a sensitive liberal like Deval Patrick would be happy that his subjects could save 5 % on goods and services .
But Deval Patrick has dollar signs in his eyes and he has found a way to fuck over Massachusetts residents once more .
Or at least he thinks he has , this is being challenged in the courts .
Town Fair Tire Centers , which is based in Connecticut but has six shops in New Hampshire and 25 in Massachusetts , is fighting back with a lawsuit now before the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court that accuses the state of violating the US commerce clause .
Of course the Massachusetts courts do n’t give a damn about the state constitution never - mind the United States constitution so the likelihood of this communist getting his way is very likely .
Massachusetts wants to stop people from buying products out of state and there is a little known tax that Massachusetts residents are supposed to pay that the governor is trying to use to stop what they consider the deplorable behavior of shopping in New Hampshire .
The use tax is designed to take away an incentive for the buyer to go out of state and not pay the taxes
The problem is that this tax is not enforceable so the Massachusetts governor is going after out of state businesses .
Here is a little idea , if you want to stop people from going out of state to make purchases lower your sales tax .
Once the difference is negligible and it is n’t worth it for people to travel to New Hampshire , the sales will increase in the state and you will probably raise more tax revenue .
It is time for New Hampshire Governor John Lynch to grow a backbone for once and tell Deval Patrick to go to hell and stop meddling in our state .
Deval Patrick and the whole liberal mindset in Massachusetts has driven too many people up here already and as recent elections have shown us they have changed the demographics here to the left .
A message to Deval Patrick ; worry about your own state and leave us alone .
A message to John Lynch ; show some stones for once and tell this man to go to hell .
I do n’t know which is worse , Deval Patrick sticking his nose where it does n’t belong , or John Lynch letting him .
" It 's great for us to be able to do a show that celebrates the spirit of a great city and at the same time allows us , in the spirit of partnership , to allow the kids to access the pools , " Parking Wars ' executive producer and director , Daniel Elias , said yesterday .
Tell me a bit about your life before you joined the military ; where were you born and grew up , why and when you enrolled , and so on ?
I can remember being 16 years old and telling my parents that I would never join the military .
Even though I was raised in a military household , my father did not bring the army home with him .
The military was not something our parents wanted us to do .
We were always told : “ College first and , if you want the military after that , it will be there afterwards . ”
I graduated high school in 1998 with no plans whatsoever for my future .
I was not ready for college .
I was not mature enough and I knew that I could have went , but I for sure would have wasted my parents ’ money .
For two years I did n’t do much other than hang out and work at a local grocery store stocking groceries 40 hours a week .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
In June of 2000 I woke up one day and decided I was going to join the army as a military police officer .
I knew that I needed to do something with my life .
I was not sure what yet , but I knew the military would help me grow up and give me some options for my future .
It is striking how specific your decision to join the Military Police was …
Law enforcement was something I was always drawn to .
It was a field I had hoped to get into ever since I was a child .
At the age of seven or eight , while we were in Fort Knox , Kentucky , I was out back down the hill with a couple friends playing in the dirt .
Suddenly , these two MPs came running our way chasing this guy for some reason .
One of them stopped and asked us where we lived and took us home .
I can remember then saying : “ One day I would like to be that guy . ”
What are some of the strongest memories you have of your training period ?
The very first day I arrived to my basic training company , all we had was the uniform on our back and two duffel bags .
Once the doors on the cattle truck were shut , you quickly knew who was in charge .
The drill sergeants were yelling : “ Get your face in your duffel bag , ” as to say : “ Do n’t look at me !
Look down ! ” I looked over to my right and noticed a guy opening his duffel bag and literally putting his head inside the bag .
It was very hard not to laugh , but I restrained from doing so .
Once we arrived to the company area the doors on the truck came swinging open and there stood more drill sergeants screaming to get off the truck .
Having the two duffel bags , we were instructed to put one duffel on the front of us and lay the second one horizontal on top of that .
Once I did this – me not being the tallest guy in the world – I could not see where I was going .
All of a sudden I came to a halt .
I had ran into something or someone .
My top duffel bag fell to the ground and that is when I noticed I had ran into the back of a drill sergeant who was in the middle of yelling at someone else .
His attention quickly turned in my direction , yelling : “ What the hell is wrong with you ?
What platoon are you going to , private ? ” I replied : “ 1st Platoon , Drill Sergeant . ”
“ Not anymore you are ; you are coming to 4th Platoon with me now , ” he said .
This is when I totally realised I was no longer a civilian .
I was property of the United States Army .
Where were you on 11 September 2001 ?
I was in Fort Hood , Texas , assigned to the 410th Military Police Company .
I was getting dressed for the day after PT when someone came in my barracks room saying : “ Get over here and see the TV . ”
We were told to grab our Kevlars and our gear and grab our M4 rifles and M9 mm out of the armoury , and that the United States was under attack by terrorists .
We were locked and load .
I was placed with other MPs at the east side entrance of Fort Hood , where we searched every vehicle and person coming on to post .
I was ready for revenge .
I was angry .
I was ready to go to war .
Someone or something had attacked my country , and I believed people needed to be held responsible for this .

What was your next assignment ?
My company went to Egypt in late September for a training exercise known as Operation Bright Star .
On 5 January 2002 , I went out with a couple buddies .
We were all at a local club just having a good ol ’ time when my cellphone rang .
It was my platoon sergeant telling me to get back to the company ASAP .
Once I arrived back to the platoon office I was told I had been selected to go to the 401st Military Police Company and deploy .
I was to report there at 0700 hours the next morning for more details .
The next day I was told that we would be deploying to Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , within the next 24 hours .
It was not until later that afternoon that we were told that we would be starting and running a detainee facility , not an EPW ( enemy prisoner of war ) camp .
We were told that a detainee camp had never been ran before , and that this would be the first time in history this had taken place since these people would not fall under the Geneva Convention .
Later that night we finished packing .
I called back home to tell my folks that I would be leaving in the morning and would not be back for at least six months .
I went and showered and just laid there that Saturday night , nervous and very anxious , wondering what I was getting myself into .
I just kept thinking about what we were told all day – that we were going to come face to face with some of the worst people the world had to offer , and that these were the people who had attacked and killed so many people in our country .
Early the next morning , 7 January 2002 , we loaded up on the buses to the airstrip and boarded the plane to Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
It does n’t seem you received a lot of training for your Guantanamo assignment .
Did you receive any training on the Geneva Conventions during your basic training ?
We did not receive any kind of special training for working at Guantanamo .
Nor did we receive any kind of real training on what would happen once we got there and the detainees starting arriving .
No one from the top down in the company knew what was really going on or what to expect .
We went out on a trial - and - error basis .
As far as the Geneva Conventions , we touched very shortly on that in training .
Most of what people knew about them was from their own readings .
Can you describe your arrival in Guantanamo ?
We arrived in Guantanamo early on the afternoon of 7 January 2002 .
Coming from Texas in January it was quite cold , so everyone had their field jackets and cold weather BDUs [ battle dress ] on .
Once we got off that plane I quickly realised I was not in Texas anymore .
It was warm .
Very warm , from what I remember .
Here we were , dressed for cold weather , carrying all these weapons like we were going to a fight a war somewhere .
All the Navy guys who were stationed there and in charge on in - processing us just kind of chuckled .
We quickly turned our weapons in to the local armoury where they would stay for the next six months .
During the bus ride we drove right through the naval base .
I remember seeing all the post , housing the BX ( or Base Exchange ) , McDonald ’s , bowling alley , the gym .
I remember thinking , “ Man !
This is going to be a really nice deployment .
We have all we need . ”
But we kept driving further and further , until there was nothing around us anymore , and in the distance you could see all these tents lined up in a row …
I laid down that first night not knowing at all what to expect .
No one knew what really was going on .
How did you spend the rest of your time before the detainees arrived ?
The next day brought us nothing .
We just sat around in our tents and slept most of the day .
On 9 January , we all got together and marched down to Camp X - Ray and walked around for a quick tour .
It was nothing like I had ever seen before .
The cells – or cages as I call them – were small .
“ Something like you would put a dog in , ” I thought .
And , on top of that , it was all outdoors .
Except for a small metal roof .
The whole camp was rocks .
No matter where you stepped you were stepping on rocks .
But , “ Oh well , ” I thought , I was not going to be staying in there .
We started our training with the Marine correctional officers .
I was placed with the group that would be doing the guarding .
Since we were all MPs we were pretty well trained in handcuffing .
But we covered it anyways : how to properly handcuff and [ use ] leg shackles .
Over and over .
We went over escorting procedures .
It was a two - man job ; one of the people escorting would force the detainee ’s head down while we walked so he could not see where he was going .
Some of us also went through the five - man internal reaction force training .
This team would be called upon supposedly when a detainee was out of control .
The No 1 Man would have the shield .
Once the cage door was open he would go in and hit the detainee as hard as he could with the shield .
No 2 Man would go in and gain control of the detainee ’s left arm ; No 3 Man would gain control of the right arm ; No 4 Man would go for the left leg , and No 5 Man would go for the right leg , take him down , and handcuff him .
This training went on for the next two days and , on 10 January , we were told that the first batch of detainees would be arriving sometime the next day , so we would be on standby the next day .
Did you get any briefing on who the soon - to - arrive prisoners were ?
The only thing I can recall being told about the detainees that would arrive was that they were captured fighting the Americans in Afghanistan .
And that they were known terrorists .
And that many of them helped in the planning of the 9/11 attacks .
We would be coming face - to - face with the worst people the world had to offer .
Our mission would be to guard these terrorists so the United States could get more info on attacks and , possibly , stop more terrorist attacks .
As to us , we talked a lot about the detainees before they arrived .
About them and what they had probably been involved in .
A lot of us , including myself , were pissed off , and many people were out to get revenge for the havoc the United States had been through in recent months by these people .
But , as the months went on , one or two of us would question what was going on here , the way the detainees were being treated , and if they were actually terrorists or not , but being no ones , and young , and dumb , we never questioned anything further ; just did our time until we went home .
So 11 January 2002 finally arrives .
This is the day the first batch of detainees would arrive .
What was the atmosphere like that day ?
Everyone , including myself , was very nervous .
We did not know when or how many detainees would be arriving that day to Camp X - Ray .
I was on standby .
After waiting a couple hours we got the call that the detainees were at the airstrip and being loaded up to bring to the camp .
I started getting really nervous ; almost scared .
I keep thinking : “ Here it comes ; I am fixing to see what a terrorist looks like face - to - face . ”
You could literally hear a pin drop moments before that bus full of detainees arrived .
Marine Humvees with .50 - calibre guns mounted on them led the bus to the camp .
The bus doors opened .
You could hear the Marines screaming at them : “ Shut the fuck up !
You ’re property of the United States of America now . ”
We were not allowed to step on to the bus .
The Marines would push them towards us down the bus stairs and we would catch them .
The first person who got off the bus , I will never forget .
It was a man with one leg .
He was later called Stumpy by everyone .
I do n’t know his name , but he was around 5ft 7in and at least 250 lb .
He was the biggest guy we had for a long time .
Grabbed by the escorting MPs , Stumpy was jumping on one leg , MPs screaming at him to walk faster towards the holding area when , from inside the bus , someone threw his prosthetic leg out on to the ground .
Myself and my partner were next .
The second detainee came off the bus .
We grabbed him like we were trained and took him into the holding area , yelling at him to get on his knees and to shut up .
Also in this bunch of detainees was an Australian .
We were told he was a mercenary caught fighting against the Americans in Afghanistan .
His name was David Hicks .
Throughout the months I would talk to him plenty of times and hear his story , along with many others , including that of Feroz Ali Abbasi .
He was British and was held on Bravo Block along with David Hicks .
How did the in - processing take place ?
After all the detainees were in the holding pen , half of the teams would take them out of the holding pen and bring them into the tent to be in - processed .
One by one the detainees were taken from the holding area to the back side of the camp , where in - processing happened very quickly .
Ear muffs , goggles and masks were taken off , their pictures were taken , and ID bracelets were made and placed on their wrists .
Then the goggles and the surgical mask were placed back on until they got to their cages .
Once in the cages … they were given two buckets ( one for water and one to use as a toilet ) , a green army mat , a small toothbrush , and a sheet .
Did any of the detainees arrive with serious injuries ?
Later that day , after my shift was over , the detainees would be taken out of their cages and go through some sort of physical examination , as many of them had injuries .
I do n’t necessarily remember the injuries of the detainees of the first group , but many of them came with injuries such as gunshot wounds , broken arms , legs .
One injury that sticks out in my mind was on a very slight , malnourished detainee , who had been grazed by a .50 calibre fighting the Americans in Afghanistan ( supposedly ) .
He arrived with the first or the second batch of detainees .
When he arrived , his right arm was in a sling .
I took him to medical a couple times throughout my time at Camp X - Ray .
I will try to explain his injury as best as I can .
Take your arm and fold it like it was in a sling against your chest .
The hole was in his bicep area .
Due to the fact his arm was in a sling , and in that position so long , the muscle had attached to his forearm somewhat , and he would go to medical so they could stretch it out .
It was a very painful time every time he went .
How did your day end ?
After we got off that day , it was late .
No one really spoke much .
I went back to my tent and laid down to go to sleep .
I was thinking : “ Those were the worst people the world had to offer ?
Not what I expected . ”
I guess I was expecting people who looked like monsters or what - not .
So much happened on that very first day …
A lot of it is a blur .
I am very ashamed to admit it and tell you that I was involved in the very first IRFing ( internal reaction force ) incident at Camp X - Ray .
On the first day we had been taking detainees from the in - processing centre to their cages for quite a while when myself and the guy that was my escorting partner grabbed the next detainee to be taken .
He was probably in his mid to late fifties – short and kind of husky build .
I remember grabbing him and then starting to walk first through the rocks and then through the sally port [ a long walkway with gates on both sides ] heading towards Alpha Block .
Then I noticed he was really tense , shaking really bad , and not wanting to walk or move without being forced to do so .
We made our way to Alpha Block , to the cage he would be placed in .
He was instructed to go to his knees , which he did .
My partner then went down and took off his leg shackles .
I still had control of his upper body , and I could still feel him tensing up .
Once the shackles were off my partner started to take off the handcuffs .
The detainee got really tense and started to pull away .
We yelled at him : “ Stop moving ! ” Over and over .
Then he stopped moving , and when my partner went to put the key in that first handcuff , the detainee jerked hard to the left towards me .
Before I knew it , I threw the detainee to the ground and was on top of him holding his face to the cement floor .
At this time my partner had left the cage .
The block NCOIC [ Non-Commissioned Officer in Charge ] was on the radio yelling code red , which meant emergency on the block .
Before I knew , I was grabbed from behind and pulled out of the cage by the IRF team .
They grabbed this man and hog - tied him .
He laid there like that for hours before he was released from that position .
A couple days later , I found out from a detainee who was on that block that the older detainee was just scared and that when we placed him on his knees he thought he was going to be executed .
He went on to tell me that this man had seen some of his friends and family members executed on their knees .
I can remember guys coming up to me after it was over that night and said : “ Man , that was a good job ; you got you some . ”
I did not feel good about what I did .
It felt wrong .
This man was old enough to be my father , and I had just beaten up on him .
I still to this day do n’t know who was more scared before and during this incident , me or the detainee .
I remember seeing him the next day when I walked into camp .
His face was all bruised and scraped up .
I was young and did n’t question anything back then .
As I do nowadays .
But even then , when I was as pissed off as anyone there , I felt ashamed of what I did .
As the years have went on and the more I learn , the more guilt I feel .
This is one of the incidents from my time at Guantanamo that haunts me .
Any incidents of abuse soon after the arrival of detainees ?
One night I was assigned to Charlie Block as a block guard .
The medic was handing medication out on the block .
He made his way over to one detainee on the block and instructed him to drink a can of Ensure [ a lot of detainees were given this as they were underweight and malnourished ] .
The detainee refused to take the Ensure .
The medic told him multiple times to take it and the detainee still refused .
The medic then went and told the block NCOIC of the situation .
The block NCOIC then went to the detainee and gave him the same instructions to take the can of Ensure .
Once again the detainee refused to follow orders .
Next , the on - duty OIC [ Officer in Charge ] was notified of the situation .
The OIC then made his way to the block where a discussion went on about the situation and the conclusion was that the detainee could not refuse any medications at all .
The camp OIC then went over to the detainee and gave him the same instruction to drink the Ensure or , if he refused , he would be forced to take it .
Once again he refused to drink it .
The call was made on the radio for the IRF team .
The IRF team entered the block where they were met by the OIC and the medic .
They were told of the situation and advised once they entered the cell they were to restrain the detainee so the medic could give him the can of Ensure .
The IRF team then started to approach the cage the detainee was in .
Since I was on the block , I walked on the other side of the cage so I could watch what was going on .
Once the IRF team was lined up and got in position to enter the cell the OIC unlocked the lock and pulled it off and opened the cage door .
The detainee just stood there , facing the IRF team .
BOOM !
The No 1 Man hit the detainee with the shield causing him to fall to the cement floor of the cage .
Quickly , the whole team was on top of the detainee .
They stood him up and hand - cuffed him to the fence in the cage .
The person who had the shield held the detainee ’s head so he could not move .
The medic then entered the cage with the can of Ensure .
Once he entered the cage he looked up and saw me .
He then motioned for me to move over to my left ( his right ) .
So I moved over .
I did not think anything about it .
He then opened the Ensure can , grabbed the detainee by the neck , and started to pour it down his throat .
The detainee was attempting to move his head , and he would n’t swallow any of it .
The Ensure just ran down his face all over him .
The medic looked up one quick time and punched the detainee twice on the left side of his face with his right fist .
The medic then just turned around and walked out of the cage like nothing happened .
The detainee was then un-handcuffed from the cage and laid down on the cement in the cage .
He was then hog -tied .
He laid in this position for a couple hours .
When the whole incident was over , I turned around and noticed the guard tower where the Marines were stationed watching over and realised that the medic had placed me in front of the view of the tower and I had not realised it .
I later learnt through other detainees on the block the reason the man refused the Ensure was that he thought he was being poisoned .
That was a ghastly incident …
One day , while on duty at Camp X - Ray , I was assigned to escorting duties .
I was at the very back of the camp .
There was like a big shed there .
This was also where the IRF team was stationed at until called upon .
On this day the call came for the IRF team to come to Bravo Block .
They made their way to the block and , at the time , I was not doing anything , so I made my way down to the block to watch from the outside .
The situation on the block was that a detainee had called a female MP “ bitch ” a couple times .
For punishment , the IRF team was called upon to enter the cage and hog - tie the detainee .
The female MP was very upset , yelling : “ Whip his ass ! ”
The IRF team , along with the camp OIC , approached the detainee ’s cage and told him to stop yelling and lay down so he could be restrained .
The detainee just stood there , staring at them .
The IRF team lined up in position to enter the cage .
The OIC unlocked the lock on the cage door and , when this was done , the detainee turned around , went to his knees and placed his hands on the top of his head .
The lock was taken off and the cage door was opened .
The No 1 Man on the IRF team tossed his shield to the side and , with a quick run towards the detainee , hopped in the air and came down on the back of the detainee with his knee .
This caused the detainee to fall to the cement floor of the cage with the No 1 Man on top of him .
Then the whole IRF team was on top of him , hitting , punching and kicking him .
It seemed like a long time , but in reality it lasted 15 - 20 seconds .
While the IRF team was still on top of the detainee , someone yelled for the female MP that was called a bitch .
She entered the cage and she punched the detainee a couple times in the head and then left the cage .
The detainee laid there cuffed - up but motionless and unresponsive .
Next thing I saw were medics coming from the medical house with a stretcher .
They left the block with the detainee on the stretcher ; they took him to a waiting military ambulance and he was transported to the main hospital .
I went back to work not fully knowing what was wrong or what happened to the detainee .
Anything you want to add about IRFings ?
I do n’t believe the IRF team was used for the right reasons at all .
At least the people on the team used it for the wrong reasons .
It was their way to beat up on someone who was smaller and weaker than them .
I have often wondered why you would need five healthy , grown men , in riot gear , to go take a down a detainee who was most likely underweight and very weak .
You say the Koran was thrown to the floor .
That suggests it was done intentionally …
When the incident happened with the Koran , I was on Alpha Block working that day .
All of a sudden detainees started to yell and chant , and it spread around the camp in a second .
Next thing I know , detainees were throwing their mats out of the cages .
Some were throwing their water out of their bucket out of the cage .
Everyone was going off .
Then we heard that on Charlie Block , during cell search , a guard had thrown the Koran to the ground , and that was the cause of this .
Well , the guard that threw the Koran to the ground was a really good friend of mine .
I talked to him that night about what happened .
He swears he did n’t throw the Koran to the ground being hateful .
He told me he was just doing a cell search – as was to be done every time a detainee left the cage .
We were told to search the Korans , and that ’s what he did .
And he said that , before thinking about it , he tossed it to the side , hitting the ground .
And that ’s when all hell broke loose in the camp .
He was very upset about the whole thing .
He was really worried something would happen to him as far as disciplinary [ action ] through the chain of command , mainly due to the fact the Colonel had stated he wanted that soldier who was responsible for this to be punished .
But he never was and , after a while , it was all forgotten about .
You say that pork was given to a detainee , without warning him and knowing that this violated religious rules ?
There was loud rock music that was played throughout the camp , especially in the early days of X - Ray .
Over time this seemed to stop , but the National Anthem was played every morning at 0630 hours .
Muslim calls to prayer were broadcast after the first week of Camp X - Ray .
During call to prayer , many times soldiers would mock and laugh at the detainees .
Many would also try to sing along to the call for prayer , trying to be funny .
I also know that sometimes , during call for prayer , water would be given out to the detainees in their bucket , and some would spray the detainees with water during prayer , then stating it was an accident .
I remember just talking to some detainees and them telling me that , since they had nothing else to do , they were studying their religion more and reading the Koran to better understand their religion .
I remember thinking I could n’t believe how dedicated these people were to their religion ; always reading the Koran , always praying .
I actually admired them for this , as you do n’t see a lot of people take religion so seriously .
You got detainees to volunteer to empty the waste buckets ?
The waste buckets were to be emptied at the end of every shift – so around every eight hours .
Us guards would empty the buckets , but eventually we started to refuse to do so , due to health reasons , and it was just plain nasty .
A whole bucket full of human waste we would pick up just wearing gloves and carry to a port potty and empty .
Eventually detainees were bribed with candy from the MREs [ ready - to - eat meals ] to empty them , and many of them did this , many stating they did so just to get out of their cage and move around .
Were there any old - timers or children in Guantanamo during your tour ?
Were they afforded any special treatment on account of their age ?
I did see a couple older people , probably in late fifties or sixties .
They were not given any special treatment at all .
They were treated just like the rest of the detainees .
As for children , I never saw any , but there was talk that some had come to Guantanamo during our time there , and that they were being kept at the Navy Brig on the base , where it was all isolation cells .
There was a lot of talk about that .
No one actually ever said there were children being held there .
There was just a lot of talk from the people who worked at the Brig that some of the detainees looked really young …
Were detainees verbally abused ?
Upon arrival , detainees were screamed at throughout the whole process .
They were told to shut up , walk faster , and whatnot .
Some guards would call them “ sand niggers ” .
I never heard that phrase until I was at Guantanamo .
Detainees would be told that their country had been nuked and nothing was left , and that their families were dead .
I know of some guards even telling detainees they could be executed at any time .
This all was being said on the blocks by fellow MPs .
You said that you talked plenty of times with the Australian prisoner David Hicks .
What did you two talk about ?
I remember David Hicks very clearly as , to me , he is one of the two most memorable detainees I came across .
Due to him being able to communicate so clearly with us .
And because he just reminded me of a guy I would have just gone out and have a beer with .
Over time , I would talk to him a couple times while at Camp X - Ray .
He would talk about how he was from Australia .
He would say sometimes how he could n’t wait to receive news from back home from his parents .
I can remember him mentioning a couple times that he was divorced and I believe he had one or two kids .
Even to me , he never denied being in Afghanistan , but he would make it a point to emphasise that he was not fighting the Americans , and said on many occasions he would not fight the Americans .
He said he was there fighting in the country before the United States started to attack .
He then went on to say he was attempting to leave Afghanistan when , one night , he was on board a taxi and the taxi was stopped by the Northern Alliance .
He was captured from there .
He then stated that the Northern Alliance did n’t treat him too badly and that , the next thing he knew , he was told he was being sold to the Americans for $ 1,500 .
Hicks did not come across as the cold - blooded killer that we were told all these guys were .
He was a normal guy like me .
And not much older .
He would sit there , crack a joke , and make small talk .
Just like any other normal person would .
During these times is when I really started to look at the detainees as real people and not just monsters , as I had been told they were .
This man had a family and people that loved him , as I had .
And we both missed them greatly and we both wanted to return to our families as soon as we could .
You say you talked a lot about music with the British detainee Ruhal Ahmed ?
I think being around the same age as him – and since I listened to a lot of music – we could connect on that level .
We also talked about normal stuff guys our age did .
Everything from girls , to what we did when we went out on the town .
Many times , while working Alpha Block , if I did n’t understand someone , or wanted to know what was going on , I would ask Ruhal for help .
I was actually older than he was by a year .
And I was only 21 at the time .
I could not imagine , at that age , suffering what he went through .
The Ruhal Ahmed I saw and spoke with was just a normal , everyday young guy like I was .
If I had seen him walking down the street or at a bar I would not think twice , and I definitely would not have thought he was a terrorist .
I know that being in the position I was in , as an active duty Military Police officer guarding the most dangerous men in the world , that I was not supposed to really interact with the detainees .
But it ’s hard .
Especially when you realise that some of these guys are no different than yourself .
The military trains you not to think and just to react and not feel any compassion for anyone or anybody .
And do what you are told .
No questions asked .
Did you witness any acts of kindness there , either by the guards or the prisoners ?
Just because many of us were guards at Guantanamo does not make us automatically bad people .
I know for a fact , one or two people , including myself , felt sorry for these people – and very ashamed of what we were taking part in .
But what could we say ?
If we questioned anything or talked out against what we thought was wrong , we would have been ridiculed .
And who knows what else we would have had to face ?
So we kept our mouths shut and went to work every day , counting down the days until we could return home to our families and just could forget about this time we spent in Guantanamo .
Although you have already begun to do so , can you tell me how you came to think the way you do about Guantanamo ?
How did your views change ?
When I initially learnt of my deployment to Guantanamo and the purpose we were going for , I was ready to go and face the world ’s most dangerous men ; these terrorists who had plotted and killed thousands of people in my country on 11 September 2001 .
I was ready to seek my own personal revenge on these people in whatever manner I could .
Then the day came when these “ world ’s most dangerous men ” arrived , and they were not what I expected to see .
Most of them were small , underweight , very scared , and injured .
I was expecting these people to come off that bus looking like vicious monsters .
Then , I was one of the people responsible for the older detainee being injured .
And seeing the abuse these detainees went through …
The same people I worked with every day , the same people I went to sleep with every night , were the same people mistreating these detainees .
After speaking with the detainees and realising they had families who loved them , just as I had , I started to realise that these people are no different than me .
Hell !
I was older than some of the ones there .
I also grew to respect the Muslim culture during my time at Guantanamo .
I greatly admired the detainees for praying all the time and being true to their religion .
You do n’t see that in America much any more .
I think everyone can agree that , at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , there are some really bad people .
And there are a lot of good people there as well .
But – innocent , guilty , black , white , Muslim , or Jew , no matter what you are – there is no excuse to treat people in the manner that I and other people did .
It ’s wrong and just downright criminal , and it goes against everything the United States of America stands for .

In ...
After running through a series of ad campaigns designed to make Windows look cool , then victimized , then simply inescapably ubiquitous , Microsoft is now hoping to attack Apple in new ads that portray Macs as unaffordable compared to generic PCs .
According to a report by the Associated Press , Microsoft hired Crispin Porter +
Bogusky , the ad agency behind the campaign pairing Bill Gates with Jerry Seinfeld , to recruit " unwitting subjects by posing as a market research firm studying laptop purchasing decisions . "
Participants found on Craigslist were given between $ 700 to $ 2,000 to buy a computer fitting certain criteria , and were told they could keep the computer they selected .
One participant named Lauren was told to buy a 17 " notebook for less than $ 1000 .
She was then filmed entering an Apple Store where she could n't find one .
Lauren then heads to Best Buy and selects a $ 699 HP machine running Windows .
That experience was turned into a 60 second TV spot for Microsoft after the agency told the buyer that the purpose of the excursion was really to promote Windows .
Shopping for hardware
The new ads do n't go into details on hardware purchases ; they simply make the case that PC laptops can be found for cheaper , playing up tight funds in the tough economy .
Best Buy actually does sell the DV7 - 1245 DX , an HP notebook with 17 " screen , but it lacks fast wireless 802.11n , fast Gigabit Ethernet , digital audio inputs and outputs , weighs 7.75 pounds , and only features the screen resolution of Apple 's 15 " notebooks : 1440 by 900 .
Technically , it is a 17 " notebook in terms of size , but it does n't have the 17 " resolution of Apple 's MacBook Pro , which is 1920 by 1200 .
Video : Laptop Hunters $ 1000 â Lauren Gets an HP Pavilion
The new Microsoft Ad
One HP buyer pointed out that this model series " has the worst screen I have ever seen in my life .
It 's the 1440x900 screen and the viewing angles are so poor that even when sitting directly eye level with the screen it is totally washed out .
If I go a little bit off - axis the screen results in a negative image .
I was using the default settings .
Unfortunately I did n't read reviews before i purchased . "
Shopping for software
More importantly however , the HP notebook runs Windows Vista , rated by ChangeWave as having the lowest operating system satisfaction rating in rankings that were led by Mac OS X Leopard and also included Linux and Windows XP .
Many PC makers continue to add a " Windows XP downgrade " as a feature on their new PCs .
This makes it particularly interesting that Microsoft would advertise its product by citing the price of the hardware it runs on , rather than calling attention to any of the features in its own product .
It 's not that Microsoft has n't tried .
Vista 's first " Wow " campaign portrayed customers in a state of pleasant shock when using it .
Shopping for an ad campaign
After those ads collapsed in an avalanche of bad press complaining about arbitrary changes that did not improve anything and software and hardware compatibility problems , Microsoft rolled out the Mojave Experiment , which showed users a " new OS " that was really just a repackaged version of Vista .
Those ads attempted to claim that Vista 's bad reputation was all due to customers not giving the system a fair shake , but the ads sidestepped the real problems users were experiencing by not allowing participants to run Vista on their own PC or with their existing software and peripherals .
Microsoft then announced a $ 300 million campaign to revive the Windows brand by associating it with skits featuring Gates and Seinfeld which promised to " tell the story of Windows . "
Instead , the ads were canceled mid-production after being poorly received .
Following that , the company released a " Windows vs Walls " campaign reminiscent of Apple 's Think Different commercials , and then a series of " I'm a PC " ads that tried to defuse Apple 's Get a Mac spots by claiming that generic PCs were empowered to do anything , except of course , producing the ads themselves , as it was embarrassingly revealed that those ads were actually created using Macs .
Promoting cheap
Talking about price during a recession where the global PC market is actually shrinking for the first time ever is probably Microsoft 's best bet in trying to stem the tide of switchers buying Macs .
However , the company has to be careful because it's also competing against free software such as Ubuntu Linux , which also runs on generic PCs .
In fact , those PCs get cheaper if they 're sold without Microsoft 's Windows , something the company has worked hard to prevent from happening .
When cheap netbooks surfaced last year and began to sell in increasing numbers , PC makers were able to hit their low price targets by bundling them with Linux .
However , Microsoft stepped in and dumped low cost Windows XP licenses on the PC makers to get them to stop selling Ubuntu 's software as a competing product , according to Ubuntu CEO Mark Shuttleworth .
Shuttleworth " believes that a decent edition of Windows [ 7 ] will mean Microsoft finally has to charge full price and that Redmond will finally stop allowing OEMs to use low - cost copies of Windows XP instead of paying full price for the full version of the official flagship - Windows Vista , " according to an interview published by the Register .
" We are in an awkward situation now because they [ Microsoft ] are giving away XP in the netbook market - they are literally giving it way to OEMs , " Shuttleworth said .
" You can make the argument Linux is more expensive that Windows XP because Microsoft has been very aggressive in licensing . "
With $ 4.00 / gallon gas prices a not - so - distant memory , alternative fuels are all the rage .
But what about the vehicles that run on them ?
Between hydrogen fuel cells , bio diesel , electricity and compressed air , the industrialized world is hard at work creating the next generation of non-oil consuming vehicles .
These new , eco-friendly chariots deserve at least as much attention and fanfare as the fuels that power them , especially these 7 models .
Compressed air

Perhaps the most tantalizing of all the alternative fuels is compressed air .
That ’s all it takes to run this car , which was designed by French engineers and will be available to American drivers by 2010 .
Hard as it may be to believe , this little car that could requires nothing more than compressed air to cruise around town at speeds of up to 35 MPH .
( If your conscience can withstand using a few drops of oil , the engine can heat and compress enough air to let the car get up to 90MPH . )
Best of all , this car will be affordable to virtually everyone at a sub - $ 20,000 price tag .
Vegetable oil
Environmentalists everywhere have been salivating at the idea of running a car on vegetable oil ever since the idea was first proposed , and we have now taken the leap from concept to reality !
Volkswagen aficionados can now drive with a clean conscience in this entirely bio diesel - powered Beetle , and they do n’t have to wait for it , either .
The Beetle shown here belongs to a fleet at Bio-Beetle , the nation ’s first - ever 100 % bio diesel car rental agency headquartered in Maui .
Hydrogen fuel cells

The prospect of hydrogen - powered cars has been enticing eco-friendly motorists for years .
And while car makers are currently grappling with a whole host of technical challenges ( such how to efficiently store hydrogen in a vehicle or how to prevent it from freezing and / or catching fire ) , that has n’t stopped the creation of deliciously fuel - efficient , hydrogen - powered proof of concept cars .
A case in point is this model from luxury vehicle giant Mercedes .
( Just do n’t expect this bad boy to be as affordable as the air - powered vehicles ! )
Ethanol

Most of us are already using ethanol in our vehicles , as federal law requires a certain percentage of it to be in the gasoline we buy .
But by 2010 , Suzuki Motor Company begin selling cars that are completely , 100 % powered by it .
The first such car ( pictured above ) will be the E25 sedan , which goes on sale in Brazil this March .
US models are soon to follow !
Water ( yes , water ! )

This Japanese car ( called the Genepax ) can travel roughly 80 kilometers per hour , for an hour , on just one liter of water as its fuel source .
The ar uses hydrogen electrons from water to produce electricity which , in turn , powers the electric motor of the car .
To all the critics who so dismissively assumed no car could ever run on water , the Genepax is a most welcome retort !

It might look like this car could only exist in a movie , but the Moovie is real and drivable by flesh - and - blood human beings .
The space age looking , 2 - seater concept car from French automaker Peugeot boasts 2 huge front wheels that can rotate at different speeds and swivel a full 360 degrees .
No word on when or if this car will be available for sale , but its mere existence is encouragement enough !

If you are n’t already astonished that there are cars that run on air and water , this one is sure to pique your interest .
The car pictured here literally runs on wood pellets .
That ’s right – essentially the same thing one might burn in a wood stove or campfire for heat is what powers this rugged , outdoors -y vehicle .
It ’s all part of what is known as biomass , a catch - all term referring to living and recently dead biological material that can be used as fuel .
" Put on your Sunday best kids , we 're going to Sears . "
Those were the words of Mike Brady to all the Brady bunch when they set out to celebrate .
Perhaps that 's what some Republicans are doing this morning with word of a new poll showing President Obama 's number slipping -- dramatically .
The Boston Herald , reports that a Zogby poll shows President Obama with only a 50 percent approval rating .
" The honeymoon is over , a national poll will signal today as President Obama ’s job approval stumbles to about 50 percent over the lack of improvement with the crippled economy . "
Doom
That means doom and despair for the president , right ?
And for the terrifying news to come up on the day he addresses the nation .
Perhaps he 's going to have to roll out the teleprompter after all .
Nah , not really .
Why ?
Four words :
It 's a Zogby poll .
Wrong
Nothing against Zogby polls .
But as Comedy Central wrote last year ( and you can quote Comedy Central if they 're right ) , " Zogby polls are always wrong . "
The left and the right will tell you the same thing .
Right
Although Glenn Reynolds touts the poll with only minor trepidation today , last August he was more blunt in his critique of Zogby reliability .
" Bad news for Obama : McCain Makes a Move , Takes 5 - Point Lead Over Obama .
...
The good news for Obama :
It 's a Zogby poll . . . . "
Left
Oliver Willis , in his entertaining " Like kryptonite to stupid " blog , provides his perspective .
" A Zogby poll is like Jim Cramer telling you to buy Bear Stearns but even less accurate , " he writes .
Zogby
Although the poll has n't been released yet , Zogby told the Herald that Obama 's recent gaffes are n't the reason for the dip .
It was more of a " combination of high expectations and that things are n’t moving fast enough with the economy , ” he said .
Other polls
To be fair , it could be right .
Even a broken clock is correct twice a day .
And inevitably his numbers will go down .
They always do .
This poll just does n't sync up with others .
Rasmussen 's daily tracking poll shows the president enjoys a 56 percent approval rating .
Gallup and CBS show a 65 and 64 percent approval rating for the president respectively .
A Palestinian woman is standing in her kitchen when she hears a deafening bang .
Rushing to her living room she sees her family in pieces , spread across floors , walls and ceiling .
The horror is total and meaningless .
Nobody meant it to happen , so what was its cause ?
The tragedy in Gaza surely marks the time when the world declares air - launched bombs and long - distance shells to be illegal under the 1983 Geneva convention .
They should be on a par with chemical munitions , white phosphorous , cluster bombs and delayed - action land mines .
They pose a threat to non-combatants that should be intolerable even in the miserable context of war .
I can accept Israeli claims that they are not intentionally targeting civilians in Gaza - or the United Nations base set on fire yesterday .
But the failure of their chosen armaments had the same effect .
The civilian death toll is now put at 673 , mostly women and children .
It is barely conceivable that the most accurate weapon of war , an infantryman , would deliberately enter a house and massacre unarmed women and children as they have their dinner .
As a result , mercifully few do .
When such cold - blooded murder is committed , from the 1968 My Lai killings in Vietnam to those now coming to light in Iraq , we are appalled , and inquiries , trials and disciplinary procedures follow .
Those killing from the air need have no sight of the carnage they unleash .
They are placed at both a geographical and a moral distance , with a licence allowed no soldier on the ground .
Whether they are dispatching free - fall bombs or GPS - guided missiles , tank shells or predator drones , Hamas 's Qassam rockets or improvised explosive devices , they know they often miss their targets , but they launder any carnage as " collateral damage " and leave politicians to handle the backlash .
The soldier shrugs and walks away , with no obligation to humanity beyond the occasional apology and a reference to the other side being just as bad .
If gas , landmines , chemical weapons and cluster munitions are now banned - a ban broadly obeyed by most civilised armies - why not aerial bombardment ?
Instead , bombing is becoming ever more prevalent .
It precedes any operation , as a sort of overture , and eagerly takes part in each tactical twist .
Counter - insurgency war , in Iraq and Afghanistan , has seen western armies take heavy casualties .
But such is the political aversion to them that Israeli , American and British ground forces operate under strict " force protection " rules to minimise losses .
This has led to the reckless use of stand - off munitions , as regularly reported by embedded correspondents .
Rather than employ infantry to clear an apparently hostile settlement , commanders call in air strikes and pound it to rubble .
The Israelis have responded to the Hamas bombardment of their towns with a far heavier bombardment of Gaza .
Both endanger civilians to a degree that cannot be other than criminal .
That human shield tactics may be involved is no excuse : the law does not permit the killing of innocents in the hope of reaching the guilty .
The bombing of urban infrastructure is an act of terror , meant to weaken the resistance of victims and cause them to surrender .
This was the case with the west 's bombing of Belgrade in 1999 and Baghdad in 2003 , the latter under the openly terrorist rubric of " shock and awe " .
Neither achieved the ambition proclaimed by the champions of air power , Bomber Harris 's promise " to win the war from the air " .
In an extraordinary article on these pages yesterday , David Miliband declared the title " war on terror " to be " misleading and mistaken " .
It apparently " gave the impression of a unified , transnational enemy , embodied in the figure of Osama bin Laden and al - Qaida " .
In reality terrorism was a disparate phenomenon , often internal to state politics .
Besides , wrote the foreign secretary : " Terrorists succeed when they force countries to respond with violence and repression . "
Miliband is right .
But those who have been saying this since 9/11 wonder what has caused this sudden conversion .
Did Miliband protest when Tony Blair reportedly pleaded with George Bush to be the first to bomb Kabul in 2001 ?
Is this the same Miliband who sat silent as a member of the government that supported " shock and awe " ?
Is he now pleading with the Americans to stop using weapons against the Pashtun - such as aerial assassination - that exacerbate both war and terror ?
The truth is that the war Miliband is still waging against militant Islam has been conducted largely by weapons of terror , namely bombs and long - distance artillery shells .
They have killed untold thousands of non-combatants since the " war " began in 2001 - a violence far more devastating than the Israelis have inflicted on Gaza - destroying unimaginable numbers of homes .
In his book Shock of the Old , the science historian David Edgerton cites the bomber as the most overrated of all weapons of war .
Glamorous , noisy , ostensibly sophisticated and easily marketed to " techno - dazzled " generals , it has proved an ineffective killing machine .
Its use against the perpetrators of terror is a classic of soldiers fighting the last war but one .
In Vietnam , Serbia , Lebanon , Iraq and Afghanistan , those deploying bomber power constantly promised more than they could deliver , as they did before D - day .
As Correlli Barnett has remarked , as in Vietnam and Kosovo so now in Gaza , the airman 's bombast , that he could terrify the enemy into surrender , must be rectified by troops on the ground .
Time and again the bomber has been outgunned by the AK - 47 .
No weapon fired at a distance can be sure of its target .
As Colin Powell once said , the phrase " tactical surgical strike " had him racing for the protection of his bunker .
All the electronics in the world seem unable to prevent constant friendly fire deaths .
Meanwhile , the dominance of air forces in procurement battles has left Britain 's land army woefully under -equipped .
In modern asymmetric warfare inaccurate munitions are worse than useless , they are a gift to enemy propaganda .
In the present Gaza turkey shoot , the Israelis cannot have intended to hit the UN , knowing the impact it would have on world opinion .
But once embarked on the campaign they clearly cannot discipline themselves .
In Afghanistan the American commander , David Petraeus , is said to regard his own side 's bombing of villages and wedding parties as utterly counterproductive .
Yet once forces are deployed , with ground and air in partnership , they seem beyond all command and control .
They illustrate Liddell Hart 's comment on military technology , that " the progress of weapons has outstripped the minds of those who wield them " .
If Israel fails to win its political objectives in Gaza , it will in part be because of its massively destructive attempt to terrify the Palestinians into surrender from the air .
Every errant missile explodes on the television screens of the world .
In the complex politics of war , these weapons are like torture .
They numb moral sensibility and do harm beyond all justification of victory .
They should be abolished .
If we wish to kill other people for whatever reason , we should use only weapons that kill the right ones .

The GSM Association announced the creation of a universal cell phone charger that will function with most mobile phones by 2012 .
The technology is based on the popular micro-USB interface .
Not - so - curiously absent from the announcement was Apple and its hugely popular iPhone , which sports a unique charging mechanism .
So what gives ?
Will Apple kill the universal charger ?
It 's not likely , but Apple 's reluctance to alter the design of the iPhone to conform to industry standards may impact the charger 's practicality and popularity .
As of January , the iPhone absorbed about 1.1 percent of the smart phone market share .
Seems like small numbers now , but it 's apparent that Apple is n't slowing down .
With reports of iPhone Nanos in the works ( despite some vehement claims against them ) and the company 's tendency to update products and expand product lines every six months , it 's safe to assume that in the future , Apple may have more than just one phone , and the iPhone may become available on carriers other than AT&T .
Expanding the horizons of the iPhone puts the device in more people 's hands , and limits the usefulness of a universal charger .
Those who are n't looking to drop top dollar on a fancy smart phone may see this as not impacting them , and they may be right : but what about when Apple releases a small , inexpensive flip - phone ?
Cupertino aside , the ever - changing nature of technology itself is another sure - fire reason the universal charger wo n't fly .
Sure , the micro-USB port is prominent right now , but what about when a better tech is invented ?
What about solar - powered cell phones ?
These universal chargers that seemed so useful yesterday add to the compost heap tomorrow .
The universal charger is an ambitious idea , but perhaps five or six years too late .

Imagine being in the perfect position to spy : you can move about without suspicion and your presence is inconspicuous .
You could learn information important to your organization and deliver it without attracting attention .
This was the position that many African - Americans found themselves in during the Civil War .
Intelligence played a critical role in the outcome of the Civil War .
The Union ’s ability to gather information about the Confederacy ’s next move allowed them to prevail in many situations .
How was the Union able to collect such crucial knowledge ?
Many brave black American men and women risked their lives to learn and share intelligence vital to the success of the Union .
Anonymous Heroes
During the war , African - Americans received recognition for their contributions through articles in the press .
However , after the war , the recognition died off .
Racial prejudice and a lack of official records of intelligence activities were factors in the lack of acknowledgment .
In honor of Black History Month and in an effort to give these brave black Americans the recognition they deserve , here are a few of their amazing stories …
The Perfect Spy
African - Americans played an important role in the outcome of the Civil War.
Slaves and freed African - Americans were an invaluable resource to the Union , providing information on the Confederate forces .
This became known as the “ black dispatches . ”
The dispatches were most commonly obtained from debriefing slaves — either runaways or those who had come under Union control .
And a few brave black Americans learned important intelligence about Confederate plans through behind - the - lines missions or by serving as an agent - in - place .
William A. Jackson
Africans - Americans who could serve as agents - in - place were a great asset to the Union .
They could provide information about the enemy ’s plans instead of reporting how the plans were carried out .
William A. Jackson was one such agent - in - place who provided valuable intelligence straight from Confederate President Jefferson Davis .
Jackson served as a coachman to Davis .
As a servant in Davis ’ home , Jackson overheard discussions the president had with his military leadership .
His first report of Confederate plans and intentions was in May 1862 when he crossed into Union lines .
While there are no records of the specific intelligence Jackson reported , it is known that it was important enough to be sent straight to the War Department in Washington .
Harriet Tubman
When it comes to the Civil War and the fight to end slavery , Harriet Tubman is an icon .
She was not only a conductor of the Underground Railroad , but also a spy for the Union .
In 1860 , she took her last trip on the Underground Railroad , bringing friends and family to freedom safely .
After the trip , Tubman decided to contribute to the war effort by caring for and feeding the many slaves who had the fled the Union - controlled areas .
A year later , the Union Army asked Tubman to gather a network of spies among the black men in the area .
Tubman also was tasked with leading expeditions to gather intelligence .
She reported her information to a Union officer commanding the Second South Carolina Volunteers , a black unit involved in guerrilla warfare activities .
After learning of Tubman ’s capability as a spy , Gen. David Hunter , commander of all Union forces in the area , requested that Tubman personally guide a raiding party up the Combahee River in South Carolina .
Tubman was well prepared for the raid because she had key information about Confederate positions along the shore and had discovered where they placed torpedoes ( barrels filled with gunpowder ) in the water .
On the morning of June 1 , 1863 , Tubman led Col. James Montgomery and his men in the attack .
The expedition hit hard .
They set fires and destroyed buildings so they could n’t be used by the Confederate forces .
The raiders freed 750 slaves .
The raid along the Combahee River , in addition to her activities with the Underground Railroad , made a significant contribution to the Union cause .
When Tubman died in 1913 , she was honored with a full military funeral in recognition for work during the war .
Mary Touvestre
Mary Touvestre was a freed slave who worked as a housekeeper for a Confederate engineer who was repairing and transforming the USS Merrimac into the Virginia , the Confederate ’s first ironclad ( warship ) .
She overheard the engineer talking about the importance of the ship and realized that it could be a significant weapon against the Northern blockade .
At great personal risk , Touvestre stole the plans for the ship and fled to Washington , where she met with the Department of the Navy .
Upon seeing the plans and hearing Touvestre ’s report , the Union Navy sped up the construction of its ironclad , the USS Monitor .
It is believed that if Touvestre had not alerted the Union of the Confederacy ’s activities , the Virginia might have caused enough damage to the blockade to allow much needed supplies from Europe to slip through .
John Scobell
John Scobell was a freed slave who was recruited by Union intelligence chief Allan Pinkerton to spy behind Confederate lines .
Scobell was intelligent and a good actor .
He took on several identities , including food vendor , cook and laborer .
Scobell often worked with two of Pinkerton ’s best agents — Timothy Webster and Carrie Lawton — posing as a servant .
Scobell provided valuable information about Confederate order of battle , status of supplies and troop morale .
He also sought out leaders in the black community to collect information about local conditions , fortifications , and troop dispositions .
The stories above are just a few examples of the amazing acts of bravery carried out by black Americans during the Civil War .

Wednesday , at an event in Santa Clara , Sun Microsystems and the Internet Archive announced a joint effort to move the Archive 's growing , three - petabyte ( about 150 Libraries of Congress ) data store into one of Sun 's Modular Datacenters — the famous datacenter in a shipping container , which we 've covered previously .
The Archive , which also hosts the ever - popular Wayback Machine , currently runs on a custom storage architecture .
But , in keeping with the group 's mission of open access to information , they opted to move it to a Sun MD that 's based on Sun Fire x4500 servers and ZFS .
" The Internet Archive offers long term digital preservation to the ephemeral Internet , " said Brewster Kahle , founder of the Internet Archive organization .
" As more of the world 's most valuable information moves online and data grows exponentially , the Internet Archive will serve as a living history to ensure future generations can access and continue to preserve these important documents over time . "
Preserving data over time is a beast of a problem , much more challenging than most people realize .
The problem of data rot is great for Sun , though , because it means that they 'll get to keep selling even more upgrades to the Archive .
Let me elaborate .
If you want to preserve info , write it down
For the past year , I 've been trying to either write or commission an article on the problem of data rot , which is pretty much what it sounds like : no matter what medium you use to store your digital data , it probably wo n't be there in readable form a few years later unless you keep copying it to ever newer media .
Fortuitously , David Pogue has a great interview on exactly this topic in today 's New York Times .
Pogue talked to Dag Spicer , curator of the Computer History Museum in Mountain View , CA .
( I was just there for an event two weeks ago , and it 's fantastic .
I look forward to bringing my daughter when she 's old enough . )
DP : Has n’t anyone tried to create a truly permanent storage medium ?
DS : One of the technologies for really long - term preservation was developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory .
It was , I think , a titanium disk about the size of a long - playing record , and it was supposed to last 10,000 years .
But then they realized that there were some assumptions that were n’t right , and that it would not last 1,000 years , it might only last 20 .
Otherwise , as far as I know , no one is working on this problem .
It ’s really in no one ’s interest , no manufacturer ’s interest ; they want to keep selling you more hard drives every two to five years , or more blank CDs , and what have you .
And that ’s why it ’s almost like your retirement , it ’s something you have to take responsibility for yourself .
No one is going to do it for you .
If you think about Spicer 's comments in light of the ongoing collapse of print and the inevitability of most publications ' transition to an online - only format , it 's clear that future historians could look back at the first part of the 21st century and see a giant lacuna .
I know that I personally have little confidence that my children and grandchildren will be able to access and read the million or so words I 've written for Ars over the years , and I 'll admit that this concerns me .
If the only way to preserve data is to keep copying it to new media , then all that has to happen for my work to disappear is for someone at some point to just not copy it .
And it seems certain that this will happen , eventually — there will be an upgrade , and a data migration , and someone just wo n't copy the Ars back catalog , and then poof .
I hate to end this article on a down note , but I need to shop for acid - free printer paper .

Apple CEO
Tim Cook was this week awarded 667,974 restricted stock units or RSUs worth more than $ 76 million at Apple 's current price , according to a filing with the SEC .
The first half of the RSUs are set to vest in one - third increments in 2023 , 2024 , and 2025 , so Cook will receive 111,329 shares every April starting in 2023 .
The second half of the RSUs are performance - based awards and will vest on October 1 , 2023 , based on Apple 's relative shareholder return .
Cook can potentially receive up to 200 % of the 333,987 RSUs awarded for performance .
These performance - based restricted stock units are scheduled to vest on October 1 , 2023 .
The " target " number of restricted stock units is reported .
Between 0 % and 200 % of the target number of units may vest based on Apple 's relative total shareholder return from the first day of Apple 's fiscal 2021 and ending with the last day of Apple 's fiscal 2023 .
Paired with the time - based stock awards , Cook can earn up to 1,001,961 shares worth more than $ 114 million today if Apple 's performance in the S&P 500 is in the 85th percentile or higher relative to other companies .
This is the first stock grant that Cook has received since 2011 , with the last of that grant set to vest in 2021 .
As noted by Reuters ' Stephen Nellis , Apple 's board of directors issued a statement on Cook 's RSU award :
Tim has brought unparalleled innovation and focus to his role as CEO and demonstrated what it means to lead with values and integrity .
For the first time in nearly a decade , we are awarding Tim a new stock grant that will vest over time in recognition of his outstanding leadership and with great optimism for Apple 's future as he carries these efforts forward .
Several employees on Apple 's executive team have also received stock awards , including Luca Maestri , Deirdre O'Brien , and Jeff Williams , all of whom have been awarded 178,128 shares .
As with Cook 's award , half of these RSUs will vest between 2023 and 2025 , while the rest are performance based awards .
The RSUs serve as bonus compensation for Cook and Apple 's executives , and will encourage employees to stay with the company through at least 2025 , which is when everything will be fully vested .
Cook has been Apple 's CEO since August 2011 , and there has been some speculation lately on how long he will continue to work for Apple .
Cook in a recent interview said that he can't envision his life not working at Apple .
I consider it the privilege of a lifetime to be here in this role at this time .
I love working with this team .
I consider them family .
It 's hard to explain .
It may sound like messaging or something , but it 's not .
It 's that deep in my heart , I really love the people I work with and currently it 's tough to envision my life without that .
So we 'll see .
At some point , of course , we all do something different , but at the moment , there 's no place I would rather be than right here .
When Cook does opt to retire at some point in the future , Apple Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams could assume the role of CEO , according to a recent Bloomberg report .
Williams is " primed " to take over for Cook if necessary and considered the " heir apparent " within Apple .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
With just over a week to go until Christmas , consumers have completed less than half of their holiday shopping - and millions have not even started yet , according to a report released Tuesday .
According to the National Retail Foundation 's " Holiday Consumer Intentions and Actions " survey , holiday shoppers said they had finished 47 % of their gift shopping by the second week of December .
That represents a significant drop from the 53 % of gift purchases completed at the same time last year .
Only 8 % of respondents said their shopping is complete , and more than 41 million people have not even begun their holiday shopping .
The wave of reluctant shoppers comes as retail industry experts say recession and mounting job losses cause households to cut back on gift - shopping this year .
" The consumers have the upper hand this year , " said Pam Goodfellow , senior analyst at BIGresearch , which conducted the survey for the retail group .
" They 're becoming better shoppers .
Everyone is holding out , expecting great last - minute deals . "
Another factor :
This year 's holiday shopping season -- which begins on Black Friday , the day after Thanksgiving , and extends to Christmas -- is five days shorter than it was last year .
Black Friday sales were better than expected this year , and by the end of that weekend first consumers had completed more of their holiday shopping than they had by the end of the same weekend last year .
But now , with a little more than a week before Christmas , shopping has slowed again and slipped behind 2007 levels .
" Since it 's all about budget shopping this year , consumers might not be seeing prices that fit their budgets , " Goodfellow said .
" And they 're sticking to those budgets . "
Hitting the discount shops
As more price - conscious consumers trade down in their gift purchases , the survey showed that discount stores are expected to be the most - shopped retail outlets over the next few days .
The NRF report said 43 % of shoppers said they plan to visit a discounter while 43 % said they would shop at a department stores .
However , another 40 % ( versus 35 % last year ) of people polled for the survey said they would skip stores entirely and hit the Internet for their holiday shopping .
Goodfellow said she expected that retailers will continue to lower prices despite already deep discounts .
" I think we 'll see them talking about those two or three days before Christmas , and even Dec. 26 , " Goodfellow said .
" People will be buying more gifts , but they wo n't be spending that much more money . "
The survey indicated that most shoppers were buying clothes , followed by books , CDs , DVDs , videos or video games , toys and electronics .
The number of people expected to buy gift cards , which have been the fastest growing category over the holiday shopping months of November and December , is expected to slip to 24 % from 30 % this time last year .
One reason for the decline in popularity of gift cards is the ongoing weakness in retail sales which has forced many leading national chains such as Circuit City ( CCTYQ ) and KB Toys into bankruptcy this year .
The concern for consumers is whether a retailer that they buy a gift card from this year might still be around in 2009 .
Using less plastic
Given the tightness in the credit markets , many more consumers say they are opting to make their gift purchases using cash this year versus credit .
The report said 66.2 % of shoppers have primarily used cash , debit cards , or checks so far , up marginally from 64.5 % last year .
" Everybody 's more concerned about prices this year , " Goodfellow said .
" They 're holding off and holding out , but nobody is going to cancel Christmas . "
BIGresearch polled 8,860 consumers for the NRF survey , which has a margin of error of plus or minus 1 % .

Having your motorcycle shipped : why and how to
In one of the more ridiculous Keynesian theories to date , Gauti B. Eggertsson at the New York Fed comes to the conclusion Tax Cuts Will Deepen The Recession .
Simple logic would dictate that letting people and businesses keep more of their money would be a good thing but amazingly Eggertsson comes to the opposite conclusion .
The belief is based on a bunch of incomprehensible ( to the non-economist ) equations such as this one .
I am not going to bother to explain what each symbol means because it is all nonsense .
The theory in English suggests
1 ) Tax cuts will increase aggregate supply
2 ) Tax cuts will reduce wages according to this chart
I am not going to bother explaining that chart either because the number of assumptions that go into the charts and formulas is staggering .
Instead let 's skip to the conclusion of the paper .
The main problem facing the model economy I have studied in this paper is insufficient demand .
In this light , the emphasis should be on policies that stimulate spending .
Payroll tax cuts may not be the best way to get there .
The model shows that they can even be contractionary .
What should be done according to the model ?
Traditional government spending is one approach .
Another is a commitment to inflate .
Ideally the two should be put together .
We are in this mess precisely because consumers spent every cent they had and then some .
Now Eggertsson wants consumers to spend more .
If they do n't spend , then Eggertsson wants government to spend on their behalf .
Excuse me but common sense alone would suggest that is spending got us into this mess so spending is not going to get us out of it .
Furthermore , never do any of these Keynesian clowns tell us what is going to happen as soon as the stimulus is taken away .
Somehow they believe in a free lunch perpetual motion theory of the economy where spending feeds on itself and we all live happily ever after .
In practice Japan tried that for a decade and it did not work and it did not work in the Great Depression either .
A more recent example of the idiocy of fiscal stimulus can be found in 2003 when Greenspan slashed interest rates to 1 % fueling the biggest property bubble in the history of the world .
That bubble has now imploded and the Keynesian clowns did not learn a damn thing from it .
And as soon as the bridges are fixed and the potholes patched and nothing happens , the Keynesian clowns will be back at it wanting government to spend still more taxpayer money .
Not one Keynesian ever has said what happens once the stimulus stops .
Triumph Of Faith Over Reason
Caroline Baum takes the Keynesian clowns to task in Fiscal Stimulus Is a Ruse Absent Fed Pixie Dust
It ’s a jobs - creation program .
No , it ’s investment in our future .
It ’s a tax - relief plan .
Wait , it provides assistance to consumers hardest hit by the economic recession .
It ’s legislation to jump - start the economy .
No , it ’s a recovery program .
It ’s a life raft for state and local governments .
It ’s a spending bill .
Which is it ?
Fiscal stimulus is all things to all people .
In other words , it represents the triumph of faith over reason .
When I first learned about fiscal stimulus according to John Maynard Keynes in an introductory economics course , it made a modicum of sense .
The idea was that at times when the private sector is n’t pulling its weight , the government can step in and spend instead .
It does n’t take an inquiring mind very long to find the flaw in the argument .
How exactly does the government get the money to pay for its spending ?
Neither borrowing ( today ) nor taxing ( tomorrow ) increases aggregate demand .
All they do is transfer the ability to spend from one entity to another and the timing of that spending from the future to today .
“ Empirically , nobody can point to a single Keynesian episode that worked , ” says Dan Mitchell , senior fellow at the Cato Institute , a libertarian think tank in Washington .
Attempts to spend their way out of a slump by Herbert Hoover , Franklin Roosevelt , George W. Bush , Japan ( in the 1990s ) and Europe yielded little in the way of results , Mitchell says .
“ The only thing Keynesians have ever been able to point to that worked was World War II , ” which is n’t something we want to repeat .
Left to its own devices , the economy ’s natural tendency is to grow .
That may sound like a cliche , but it ’s true .
It 's not often that a Singaporean official concedes the limits of the city - state 's economic engineering .
But the downturn is proving so severe that the Finance Minister said in yesterday 's budget speech that the government 's stimulus package " will not get us out of the recession , " but rather " help avert an even sharper downturn . "
That ought to be a wake - up call for Singapore , where government built a modern metropolis by hoarding its citizens ' capital , plowing those savings into designated industries and opening itself up ...
Plane Down at Schiphol Turkish Airlines Passenger Jet Crashes in Amsterdam
A passenger jet carrying 134 people crashed on approach to Amsterdam 's Schiphol airport on Wednesday morning .
Nine people died in the accident , according to local officials .
Hydrogenated Oils Without The Trans Fats
To prolong the shelf life of foods , manufacturers often add hydrogen to natural oils , a process called hydrogenation .
But hydrogenation also results in the production of trans fats , which have adverse health effects such as raising bad cholesterol and increasing the risk for coronary heart diseases .
Trans fats are found in vegetable shortenings , some margarines , crackers , cookies and snacks .
Health authorities worldwide recommend that people reduce their consumption of trans fats .
UC Riverside chemists have designed a catalyst ( a substance that accelerates a chemical reaction ) that allows hydrogenated oils to be made while minimizing the production of trans fats .
In their experiments , the researchers , led by Francisco Zaera , a professor of chemistry , used platinum , a common catalyst for these processes .
By controlling the shape of the platinum particles , the Zaera group was able to make the catalyst more selective .
Catalytic selectivity refers to the ability of a catalyst to select a specific pathway from among many possible chemical reactions .
In the case of the researchers ' experiments , selectivity refers to the production of partially hydrogenated fats without the making of trans fats .
Zaera 's lab found that the platinum catalyst performed most selectively when its particles assumed tetrahedral shapes , with the atoms arranged in a hexagonal honeycomb lattice .
Particles with these shapes allow for the preservation of the harmless cis configuration in the hydrogenated fats .
Other lattices , the researchers found , favor the production of trans fats .
Platinum catalysts such as those used by the Zaera group are considered heterogeneous because they exist in a different phase ( solid ) than the reactants ( liquid or gas ) .
Compared with homogeneous catalysts , where the catalyst is in the same phase ( liquid ) as the reactants , heterogeneous catalysts have the advantages of easy preparation , handling , separation from the reaction mixture , reuse , high stability , and low cost .
But their main disadvantage is that , unlike homogeneous catalysts , which tend to be molecular , heterogeneous catalysts must be dispersed as small particles in a high surface - area support in order to optimize their use .
This typically results in catalysts with surfaces of ill - defined structures .
The research by Zaera and his colleagues is a breakthrough also because it shows for the first time that it is possible to achieve selectivity with heterogeneous catalysts like platinum by controlling the structure of their surfaces .
" The more control we can exert on how we prepare catalysts , the more we can control the catalytic selectivity of a particular chemical process , " Zaera said .
" Our work shows that it is possible to make heterogeneous catalysts that afford us more control on selectivity .
This opens the door , we hope , for chemists to think about achieving selectivity for other reactions via the design of specific heterogeneous catalysts with specific shapes . "
Zaera explained that heterogeneous catalysts tend to be more practical in terms of manipulation , but are harder to control .
" Our paper shows that , thanks to new advances in nanoscience , sophisticated and highly selective heterogeneous catalysts can be made by controlling their structures , " he added .
" In this sense , our paper changes the paradigm of heterogeneous catalysis .
These catalysts can now compete more closely with homogeneous catalysts , which industry traditionally uses for reactions that require high selectivity such as those involved in the manufacture of medicines or other fine chemicals . "
Next in their research , Zaera 's lab plans to find other reactions where selectivity is needed .
The researchers also plan to improve on the synthetic techniques used to make selective catalysts .
Nearly 80 percent of all chemical industrial processes use catalysts .
With annual global sales of about $ 1500 billion , catalysts contribute approximately 35 percent of the world 's gross domestic product .
They are used in the manufacture of commodity , petro- and agro-chemicals , pharmaceuticals , cosmetics , foods , and polymers .
Study results appeared online earlier this week in Nature Materials .
Zaera is a senior editor of The Journal of Physical Chemistry , and serves on the editorial boards of several scientific journals , including Catalysis Letters and Topics in Catalysis .
He was joined in the study by Ilkeun Lee ( first author of the research paper ) , Ricardo Morales , and Manuel A. Albiter of UCR ; and Françoise Delbecq of Université de Lyon , France .
A grant from the National Science Foundation funded the research .
February 2009 might well go down as the month when Twitter replaced Facebook as the hottest and coolest company in Silicon Valley .
First , Twitter closed a $ 35 m ( £ 24 m ) round of venture capital investment at a valuation of about $ 250 m – not bad for a revenue - less start - up in the depths of the worst liquidity crisis since the Great Depression .
Second , research from Pew Internet and American Life Project revealed that a whopping 11 per cent of Americans have used a service such as Twitter .
Third , in a survey of 200 top digital marketing mavens , Abrams Research showed Twitter trounced Facebook in the all - important question of which social media service is the most effective financial investment for businesses – Twitter getting 40 per cent and Facebook only 15 per cent of the vote .
Of course , the 29 person , two - year - old Twitter is in that pre-adolescent stage of development when it can do no wrong in the eyes of the Silicon Valley cognoscenti .
The network has experienced phenomenal growth with active users growing 900 per cent in the past year .
Anyone who is anyone is on Twitter these days : Stephen Fry , Barack Obama , Shaquille O’Neal and Jonathan Ross .
Best of all , the advertising free Twitter has n’t had to worry about the inconvenience of revenue with the San Francisco - based company only getting around to hiring its first head of sales in the past month .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The five - year - old Facebook , on the other hand , has – to excuse the teenage metaphor – collided head - on with the pimples of adolescence .
While Twitter was having a miraculous February , Facebook ’s month has been gruesome .
It all began when the Consumerist website , in an inflammatory post entitled “ We Can Do Anything We Want With Your Content Forever ” noted a number of significant changes in Facebook ’s terms of service and suggested that the company intended to keep the information of users who quit the network .
“ Facebook owns you ! ” cried tens of thousands of paranoid members , thereby forcing Mark Zuckerberg , Facebook ’s 25 - year - old CEO , to publicly rescind the changes and limp back to his original TOS .
The storm is really about how the company transforms the information of Facebook ’s current 175 million social networkers into dollars and cents .
Having been valued at a ludicrous $ 15bn when Microsoft invested $ 240 m in the social network in October 2007 , Facebook is now under immense pressure to prove that its free service can generate significant revenue .
And given the premium advertisers pay for personal information , it is n’t surprising that the real fear of the change in its TOS was about Facebook selling the data of its former members to the highest corporate bidder .
Ev Williams and Biz Stone , Twitter ’s two young co-founders , should learn from Facebook ’s growing pains .
In a year or two , Twitter will have inherited these uncomfortable growing pains .
The micro- blogging site will have been replaced as the start - up darling of the Valley by a fresh - faced new thing .
It will probably also have to quell the digital rebellion of Bolshevik users who claim “ ownership ” of the service .
Most of all , Twitter will soon have to prove to investors that it has a viable strategy for transforming its millions upon millions of Tweets into hard cash .
The following is an article put out by Reuters .
What follows it is the response of a farmer .
Who is asking pertinent questions ?
Or perhaps more seriously , who is asking any questions at all ?
Does Monsanto send out pre-prepared articles for Reuters and other media to use - sparing them all effort to write stories or investigate ?
Is Monsanto using media as a free extension of their own many , large PR agencies ?
And at this time in world history , with countries battling to keep out GMOs and save their own biologic inheritance and biodiversity , does Reuters and other media not have a greater responsibility than ever to function as a real media and bring truths to light since life itself depends on it ?

Calling from C into Ocaml .
I 've got a project where it would be nice to be able to call Ocaml code from a C program .
Although interfacing Ocaml and C is covered in the official manual and the O'Reilly Ocaml book , neither of these sources have a complete example .
As a firm believer in the idea that a 100 lines of working code is worth a thousand lines of explanatory text in a book or on the web , I thought I 'd put together a small but complete example .
First off , here is the Ocaml code ( download ocaml - called-from -c.ml ) :
let ocaml_puts name = Printf.printf
" Program name is ' %s ' .
" name ; (* Must flush stdout before returning to C. *) flush stdout let ocaml_string_join join arr = (* Create and return a string .
*) String.concat join ( Array.to_list arr ) (*
On program initialisation , register functions to be called from C. *) let ( ) = Callback .register " ocaml_puts " ocaml_puts ; Callback.register " ocaml_string_join " ocaml_string_join
There are two functions that will be called from C , ocaml_puts and ocaml_string_join and both functions must be registered as callbacks with the Ocaml runtime using Callback .
register .
To find the function signatures of these functions we can use the ocamlc program :
prompt > ocamlc - i ocaml - called - from-c.ml val ocaml_puts : string -> unit val ocaml_string_join : string -> string array -> string
The first function has a single string parameter and returns nothing , while the second takes two parameters , a string and an array of strings and returns a string .
The C program which calls these two functions looks like this ( download c-main-calls-ocaml. c ) :
#include < stdio.h > # include < stdlib.h > # include < string.h > # include < caml/alloc.h > # include < caml / mlvalues .h> # include < caml / memory.h >
# include < caml/ callback.h> static void call_ocaml_void ( const char * name ) { CAMLparam0 () ; CAMLlocal1 ( ostr ) ; ostr = caml_copy_string ( name ) ; value * func = caml_named_value ( " ocaml_puts " ) ; if ( func == NULL ) puts ( " caml_named_value failed ! " ) ; else caml_callback ( * func , ostr ) ; CAMLreturn0 ; } /* call_ocaml_void */ static void call_ocaml_string ( char * join , char const ** argv ) { CAMLparam0 () ; CAMLlocal3 ( ojoin , oargv , ores ) ; ojoin = caml_copy_string ( join ) ; oargv = caml_alloc_array ( caml_copy_string , argv ) ; value * func = caml_named_value ( " ocaml_string_join " ) ; if ( func == NULL ) puts ( " caml_named_value failed ! " ) ; else ores = caml_callback2 ( * func , ojoin , oargv ) ; printf ( " Ocaml returned : ' %s '
" , String_val ( ores ) ) ; CAMLreturn0 ; } /* call_ocaml_string */ int main ( int argc , char ** argv ) { const char * progname ; int k , count ; progname = argv [ 0 ] ; if ( strstr ( progname , " . / " ) == progname ) progname += 2 ; if ( argc < 2 ) { puts ( " Need at least 1 command line argument . " ) ; exit ( 1 ) ; } ; count = argc >= 2 ? atoi ( argv [ 1 ] ) : 1 ; count = count < 1 ? 1 : count ; printf ( " Count : %d
" , count ) ; /*
Must call this before calling any Ocaml code .
*/ caml_startup ( argv ) ; for ( k = 0 ; k < count ; k++) call_ocaml_void ( progname ) ; for ( k = 0 ; k < count ; k++) call_ocaml_string ( " " , ( char const **) ( argv + 1 ) ) ; return 0 ; } /* main */
The main function is mostly self explanatory ; the only thing to note is that if we want to call any Ocaml code from C , we must call caml_startup first .
Looking at the functions that call into Ocaml , note that these functions begin with a call to CAMLparam0 and ends with a call to CAMLreturn0 .
These are both macros , the first of which sets up the Ocaml specific stack requirements and the second of which cleans up after the first .
The ' 0 ' at the end of their names indicates that there are zero Ocaml managed data objects passed into and returned from the C function respectively .
For values to be passed to Ocaml , we use local Ocaml managed variables set up with CAMLlocal1 if we only have one , or CAMLlocal3 if we have 3 .
Data can be copied into these local Ocaml variables using the caml_copy _* and caml_alloc_ * families of functions .
The Ocaml functions we want to call can be looked up by name using caml_named_value and the function actually called using caml_callback if we only have one parameter to pass or caml_callback2 for two parameters .
For the call to ocaml_string_join which returns a string , we can extract the return value from the Ocaml wrapper using String_val .
There are also other functions to retrieve other data types , the only real caveat being that if the type is n't atomic ( eg int or double ) and you want to return it from the C function it will be necessary allocate memory for it and copy it because the memory area returned from Ocaml will be invalid after the call to CAMLreturn0 .
Finally , building this simple example can be done as follows ( using version 3.10.2 of the Ocaml compiler ) :
ocamlopt -c ocaml - called - from-c.ml - o ocaml- called-from-c.cmx ocamlopt - output-obj - o camlcode.o ocaml-called-from-c.cmx gcc -g - Wall - Wextra -c c-main-calls-ocaml.c -o c-main-calls-ocaml.o gcc camlcode.o c-main-calls-ocaml.o - ldl -lm -L /usr/lib/ocaml/3.10.2 \ - lasmrun -o c-main-calls-ocaml
The first line compiles to Ocaml file into an Ocaml object ( *.cmx ) using the native code compiler , the second takes the Ocaml object and all the other Ocaml objects needed and generates a object file ( camlcode .o ) that can be linked to C code .
The last two lines compile the C code into an object file and then links all the C objects and required libraries into an executable .
prompt > ./c-main - calls - ocaml 4 abc wxyz Count : 4 Program name is ' c - main - calls - ocaml ' .
Program name is ' c - main - calls - ocaml ' .
Program name is ' c - main - calls - ocaml ' .
Program name is ' c - main - calls - ocaml ' .
Ocaml returned : ' 4 abc wxyz '
Ocaml returned : ' 4 abc wxyz '
Ocaml returned : ' 4 abc wxyz '
Ocaml returned : ' 4 abc wxyz '
At this point its probably a good idea to run the program under valgrind and vary the first parameter to prove to oneself that un - freed memory when the program terminates is a constant ( due to the Ocaml runtime ) and does not vary in proportion to the number of times the Ocaml code is called ( which would indicate a memory leak in the interface code ) .

Spending cuts are the theme of the Senate 's compromise draft of legislation meant to inject cash into a flagging economy .
Those include a $ 2 billion reduction in money for rural broadband deployment , bringing the total down to $ 7 billion — though that 's still more than the $ 6 billion allocated for broadband in the House version of the bill .
There 's also disagreement about who will control whatever funds are allocated : the original Senate language puts the money in the hands of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration , but some Senators prefer the House bill 's strategy of splitting the cash between NTIA and the Department of Agriculture .
All of this leaves the prospects for this spending , which still faces a House - Senate reconciliation , very uncertain .
The prospect of an unprecedented federal outlay on broadband deployment , politically unimaginable a year ago , has brought together some strange bedfellows in recent months .
For the first time , it seemed as though advocacy groups like Free Press and Public Knowledge , corporations normally on frosty terms ( such as AT&T and Google ) , and techie academics were all singing from the same hymnal .
With the total spending package expected to top $ 820 billion , and President Obama pledging to invest in high - tech infrastructure , some groups dared to hope for a broadband windfall as large as $ 44 billion
It did n't take long for the serpents to emerge in Eden , of course .
Telecoms — and Republicans — have balked at the " open access " strings on those federal dollars ; these are vague in terms of practical significance , but seen by many as a backdoor imposition of net neutrality regulation .
An untimely Pew survey appeared to show that two - thirds of putatively " underserved " Americans without broadband simply do n't want it .
Meanwhile , the value of broadband spending as " stimulus " has come into question .
Robert Crandall , the Brookings Institution scholar whose research has been used to justify ambitious claims about broadband 's ability to produce jobs , has complained that his findings have been misused , and called assertions that each percentage point increase in broadband adoption could generate 300,000 jobs a " gross overstatement . "
A recent editorial in The Economist argued that money is better spent on other projects if the goal is to create near - term job growth — in part because government dollars may simply displace private funding .
There 's also , of course , disagreement about how " stimulus " money would be managed .
Already , a Minnesota task force has removed several municipal broadband efforts — frowned upon by some private telecoms as unwelcome competition — from a list of " shovel - ready " projects , in part because " state officials will have less control over how the federal money is spent than was previously thought . "
Which federal agencies will have a say in the outlays is also a bone of contention ; both the telecoms and advocacy groups like Free Press would prefer control of the money to be centralized under the supervision of the NTIA , rather than split between Commerce and Agriculture .
But the telecoms are less sanguine about giving the Federal Communications Commission a role — for more or less the same reason that the advocacy groups favor it : it 's likely to mean more regulatory strings .
A cloture vote on the final stimulus bill — expected to be razor thin , with only a few Republicans crossing the aisle to join Democrats , who need 60 votes to overcome a filibuster threat — is slated for Monday .
Assuming that passes , a vote on the bill itself will likely come Tuesday .

Rick�s Picks Friday , December 12 , 2008 � Phenomenally accurate forecasts
A while back , when Microsoft shares were trading in the mid-$ 20s , we used charts to predict they would eventually fall to $ 4 or lower .
How could such a thing happen to a company with a product that dominates the software world , and with cash reserves totaling more than $ 20 billion ?
For starters , consider that Microsoft used to have twice that sum on hand but squandered a big chunk of it on investments that would make the guys at Bear Stearns look like visionaries .
Also , they have not exactly enticed new customers in droves with the clunky Vista operating system .
While the Redmond behemoth may have been able to ram this product down the throats of captive business and institutional customers , much as they have been doing for years with each new , gratuitously enhanced version of Windows , individual buyers have deserted the platform en masse .
Just look around you the next time you �re at Starbucks : probably half of the computers one sees these days outside of the office and commercial airliners are Macs .
The percentage is even higher at college libraries .
These are tomorrow�s business users , and most of them wouldn�t use a PC if it were given to them free .
Meanwhile , Microsoft has promoted the lie that if buyers want new PCs with the old XP operating system , the only choices available are low - end machines .
This is untrue , as I discovered a month ago , when I bought the computer I am working on at the moment , a Dell XPS that is one of the most powerful models in their line .
Microsoft would have been pleased to drop support for the XP operating system a year ago , but it�s plain to see that boxmakers like Dell have simply not allowed it .
Buggier than Ever Another reason Microsoft�s shares , currently trading for around $ 20 , might actually be headed below $ 4 is that the Windows operating system has become too bloated and buggy to run third - party applications smoothly .
Indeed , remedies for even the most minor - seeming problems with these applications are now beyond the capabilities of most vendors� support staffs .
I know , because I spent more than 20 hours on the line with tech support in an unsuccessful attempt to make a high - end sound card work properly in my old PC .
I also had the help of a system administrator who was trained as an audio engineer .
And have you ever tried to get Outlook to remember a password for accessing POP mail at , say , Google ?
I did and failed , even with the help of an online tech wizard nicknamed � War� who had amassed 100,000 points as a troubleshooter at a paid - support Web site .
But the stake through Microsoft�s cold , monopolistic heart may be the new product announced last week by IBM �an office suite that runs on cheap : thin clients � connected to a backroom Linux server .
IBM says customers will save $ 500 - $ 800 compared to what they would spend to license Microsoft�s office suite , which includes the ever popular Excel , PowerPoint and Word .
The savings would come not just from the software , but from , reduced costs for hardware , electricity and air conditioning .
Same Old Architecture
Ironically , the cover story in the current issue of Wired magazine is about a man , Ray Ozzie , who supposedly is going to fix the House That Bill Built .
Ozzie 's qualifications are impressive -- he invented Lotus Notes -- but one wonders whether the culture of mediocrity is so deeply ingrained at Microsoft that the firm is incapable of acting like a start - up , which is Ozzie 's plan .
Keep in mind that for all Ozzie 's talk about innovation , and about moving Microsoft into a position to dominate the " cloud " of wireless possibilities , Microsoft chose to perpetuate its failing business model with the release of Vista .
Although this goes bluntly against Ozzie�s vision , it apparently won�t stop Microsoft from releasing Windows 7 , which is built on the same architecture as the execrated Vista O/S. *** Free Webinar for E - Mini Traders

Diskeeper responds to Godelman 's opposition to motion to strike
I realize that we ’re trundling on down the procedural rabbit hole here , and it ’s pretty easy to get lost , so let me start by providing an enumerated roundup of where we are and how we got here .
1. In November , 2008 , Godelman and Le Shay filed its 3d Amended Complaint , alleging wrongful termination [ pdf ] against Diskeeper .
Among the relief requested is a prospective injunction which would prevent Diskeeper from requiring present and future employees to take Hubbard Management Technology courses .
2. On December 10 , 2008 , Diskeeper moves to strike [ pdf ]
Godelman ’s prospective injunction request , arguing that it is barred as a matter of law , an argument I believe they fell far short in demonstrating .
3 . On January 13 , 2009 , Godelman opposed Diskeeper ’s motion to strike , arguing that the prospective injunction request is permitted by law and that the injunction request was not “ irrelevant , false or improper , ” which is the legal threshold one must establish in order for the court to strike material from a pleading .
3A . After I posted item # 3 , I received a letter from Diskeeper ’s counsel , vaguely threatening me with having violated a court ordered confidentiality stipulation and requesting that I retain ‘ all correspondence related to this matter . ’
I surmised in an ARS post that Diskeeper ’s sensitivity was likely due to the presence of Exhibits C & D from Godelman ’s opposition ( item # 3 above ) .
Exhibit C contained selected pages from the LRH Organization Executive Course , and Exhibit D was excerpted transcripts of Craig Jensen ’s deposition .
This brings us up to date , and brings us to the next chapter of the evolving procedrual saga :
4. Diskeeper ’s Reply to Godelman ’s opposition [ pdf ] , along with a , wait for it … an Objection and Request to Strike Evidence Submitted by Plaintiffs in Support of Opposition to Diskeeper Corporation ’s Motion to Strike .
The Reply first argues , in somewhat convoluted fashion , that ( 1 ) Godelman failed to address Diskeeper ’s argument that a business may adopt a religious practice into its business model ; ( 2 ) a total lack of authority notwithstanding , the federal standard of review for California ’s Labor Law ( FEHA ) with respect to the free exercise of religion should be strict scrutiny , because FEHA ’s “ direct purpose and effect is to regulate or limit religious practice ” ; and ( 3 ) a total lack of authority notwithstanding , California ’s Constitution mandates strict scrutiny with respect to religious free exercise questions .
If the above does n’t make sense to you , it ’s not you –it really does n’t make sense .
Diskeeper ’s argument that the plaintiffs requested injunction “ would violate both statutory and First Amendment and California constitutional protections of an employer ’s right to incorporate religious practices in the workplace ” ( a ) utterly fails to account for plaintiffs ’ free exercise interest , the presence of which renders a motion to strike as entirely improper , given that competing free exercise interests cannot effectively be weighed without trial ; and ( b ) even if plaintiff ’s ’ free exercise interest was not present , Diskeeper ’s argument for application of a strict scrutiny standard is dubious at best , since far a better argument can be made that FEHA is a neutral law of general applicability , and does not , as Diskeeper contends , target and / or regulate religious practice .
As noted above , Diskeeper also filed an Objection and Request to Strike Evidence , which seeks to strike Exhibits C & D from Godelman ’s motion , as well as certain statements made by Diskeeper ’s attorney , Barry Kaufman .
Their basis for this argument is these items are unauthenticated and improperly admitted extrinsic evidence .
Kaufman ’s affirmation is not being offered as evidence , of course [ the statement is , verbatim : “ discovery has by now unequivocably confirmed that new employees at Diskeeper are required to study , learn and apply the so - called ‘ Hubbard Management Technology ’ in performance of their work for Diskeeper ( and that their failure or refusal to do so can result in discipline or discharge ) . “ ] , so I do n’t really know what to make of Diskeeper ’s characterization of the statement as being extrinsic evidence .
Diskeeper also asserts that the Hubbard Management Technology excerpts ( Exhibit C ) are unauthenticated and , despite failing to make any argument as to why the Craig Jensen deposition transcripts ( Exhibit D ) should also be considered extrinsic evidence , moves to strike those as well .
Diskeeper sums up its argument , presumably with a straight face , that Kaufman ’s statements and Exhibits are “ not the proper subject or proper evidence for consideration on a motion to strike , ” but are rather factual disputes more properly brought during trial .
This assertion is especially ironic given that I ’ve said precisely the same thing about Diskeeper ’s motion to strike–they very well could prevail on the merits of their argument that a prospective blanket injunction preventing Diskeeper from requiring ( note emphasis ) LRH Management Technology is improper … but at trial , not in a motion to strike .
The bottom line is that Diskeeper ’s motion to strike Godelman ’s request for prospective injunctive relief opened the door for Godelman to go out on the same limb Diskeeper ’s been granted ; and now Diskeeper wants to limit the limb for itself .
When you think of birds , you most likely think of very docile , perhaps graceful creatures that present themselves in your backyard as you watch them peacefully go about their daily routines .
Perhaps you think of the larger birds such as a hawk or a falcon that you watch in the sky as they glide elegantly through the atmosphere .
What you do n’t think about is getting pounded by wings or legs or getting torn to shreds by beaks and getting your bones crushed by talons .
They look so harmless for the most part , but some birds are not only physically strong enough to kick your ass and in some cases cause death , but some species are aggressive enough to do it .
Some of the these birds on the countdown you ’re going to expect , while others will surely surprise you .
11 . Vulture
Though a vulture ’s prey is normally dead animals , a vulture could kick your ass if you provoked it to want to do so .
Ultimately , a vulture would not be interested in attacking you , but it could do some serious damage if it had to due to its sharp hooked beak that ’s specifically designed to tear flesh .
Ouch !
10 . Canada Goose
Though the Canada goose only weighs between 7 and 14 pounds , it can be very aggressive especially when defending its young .
If a Canada goose attacks you , it may use its sharp beak to penetrate your skin or it could even pound on you with its wings that span between 4 feet and over 5 ½ feet .
9. Seagull
If you ’ve ever been to a beach or any other area where there are seagulls , you ’ll know that they ’re normally very docile though very pushy when it comes to food .
It seems as if they have one scout seagull to lurk near you when you have food and look as pathetic as possible .
As soon as you feed that single seagull , all seagulls within a five mile radius suddenly appear .
They ’re not violent .
They just want your food .
However , if you get too close to their nest , the story of these normally docile creatures changes and they become very aggressive and will attack you with their sharp beak .
They ’ve been known to peck so hard and violently on a person ’s head that there has been at least one case that left someone with injuries severe enough to be hospitalized .
8. Condor
As the largest flying bird in the Western Hemisphere , you could imagine that the condor could do some pretty good damage to a human .
In fact , this was unfortunately put to the test on August 21 , 1999 when a condor attacked a little girl just under the age of three years old at the Columbus Ohio Zoo .
During a show , the condor flew from its handler and knocked the girl down and gave her three bad puncture wounds .
My guess is that the little girl was actually pretty lucky as I fear that this bird could have done a lot worse .
7. Falcon
Like most of the birds in this countdown , the falcon is n’t overly aggressive normally , but I surely would n’t push it by getting too close to a nest .
You can expect to get knocked on your ass if a falcon were to dive at you at up to 124 mph or put some talon pressure on you of over 200 pounds per square inch .
The falcon also has a razor sharp beak that can cut through the spinal cord of its prey .
Though it most likely would n’t be effective for cutting through the spinal cord of a human , it could still do some severe damage .
6 . Hawk
Hawks can easily tear flesh with their overlapping and sharp beaks that resemble the action of scissors .
It ’s unlikely that a hawk will pierce all the way through your skin , but some serious puncture wounds would be a certainty .
The talons would be sure to do you in as well as hawks have crushing pressure in their talons of almost 200 pounds per square inch .
Also , hawks have very keen eyesight and if they were stalking you like prey , you ’d have a very difficult time avoiding it .
I would also be impossible to get away since a hawk can dive at speeds that can reach up to 180 mph .
Can you imagine what a body slam from a hawk would feel like ?
5 . Owl
As there are over 200 species of owls , it ’s a little difficult to describe the damage an owl can do .
For the most part owls will leave humans alone , but if you approach one during mating season or get too close to a nest , you could be in serious trouble .
With 800 pounds per square inch of crushing pressure in its talons , it would n’t be difficult for an owl to break some bones .
If the sharp hooked beak is n’t enough to intimidate you , combine that with up to 125 pounds per square inch of crushing pressure in the beak as well .
4. Rhea
Native to South America and an endangered species , the flightless rhea on average grows to be 60 to 80 pounds , but can weigh as much as 88 pounds .
When we say that the rhea could “ kick your ass ” , that ’s exactly how it could mess you up – by kicking .
The strength in a rhea ’s legs is enough for it to be able to kick at a power of 800 pounds per square inch ; more than enough to just ruin your day .
3. Eagle
As a rule , eagles do n’t bother humans though there have been some reports of such occurrences .
However , if you were to fight against an eagle , your defeat is certain .
First , it has extremely keen eyesight that can spot prey from up to a mile away , giving the eagle an advantage from the start .
Next , if an eagle wanted to attack you , one effective way would be to just dive at you .
Though the bald eagle only weighs 7 to 15 pounds , when in a dive it can travel as fast as 150 to 200 mph .
That ’s some impact .
Additionally , eagles have a scissor - like beak that ’s razor sharp and overlaps making its job to tear through skin very easy and effective .
Lastly , the talons on an eagle are more than enough to crush bones as the crushing pressure can be up to 1,000 pounds per square inch .
2. Ostrich
Though they look awesome from far away , the closer you get to the ostrich , the world ’s largest bird , the more you realize just how massive they are .
An ostrich is taller and also outweighs most humans as they can be up to 9 feet tall and weigh up to 350 pounds .
They could do some serious damage with their beaks , but that would be nothing compared to the damage an ostrich could do with its legs .
An ostrich has a kick so powerful that it can exert about 500 pounds of pressure per square inch in its kick .
Also , due to the strength in its legs , the ostrich has extreme stamina and speed when running , so you have no chance of outrunning one .
An ostrich can run for up to 10 miles straight without stopping and can do so at a consistent 30 mph .
1. Cassowary
Though smaller than an ostrich at five to six feet tall and only about 130 to 150 pounds , the cassowary , native to New Guinea and Australia was named the most dangerous bird in the world in the 2007 edition of the Guinness World Records list .
First of all , cassowaries are extremely aggressive and there are numerous reports of attacks every year .
The single claw on each foot could mess you up as it ’s very sharp and almost 5 inches long , but that ’s the least of your worries .
Like the ostrich , the cassowary ’s strength is in its legs as it can kick with the power of 800 pounds per square inch of pressure .
From this , you should have learned a few things .
The first and most important thing is that you can appreciate the beauty of birds , but it ’s imperative that you respect them and respect their space .
Though encounters can occur from some species of birds unprovoked , most attacks are provoked .
If you remember to marvel at these birds from a distance , you can appreciate them a lot more than if you were to get on the bad side of one of these amazing creatures .
Bernie Madoff Pleads Guilty to Ponzi Scheme , Goes Straight to Jail , Says He's ' Deeply Sorry '
No more penthouse lifestyle for the financial scammer .
March 12 , 2009  --
Applause broke out in a Manhattan courtroom today when a judge denied admitted Ponzi scheme operator Bernard Madoff 's request to return to his luxury penthouse , and instead ordered him handcuffed and taken straight to jail .
Madoff pled guilty to 11 felony counts Thursday including securities fraud , mail fraud , wire fraud , money laundering , and perjury .
He faces a 150 year sentence .
" For many years up until my arrest I operated a Ponzi scheme , " Madoff told the court .
" When I began I thought it would be over shortly , it became difficult to stop . "
Read Bernard Madoff 's courtroom statement here .
For the first time , Madoff offered a public apology saying he is " deeply sorry and ashamed . "
" I knew what I was doing , it was wrong and I 'm deeply sorry , " Madoff said .
Madoff remained passive throughout the hearing .
He required a sip of water before he began to speak and bowed his head every time he answered " guilty " to all 11 counts .
He wore a white shirt and grey suit .
At the close of the hearing , Madoff was handcuffed and led away by marshals .
His attorney , Ira Lee Sorkin , had asked the judge to allow Madoff to remain in his apartment until the sentencing saying that Madoff 's wife Ruth would pay for security to prevent his flight " at her own expense " , at which point the audience broke out in laughter until Judge Denny Chinn quieted them down .
Sorkin said after the hearing that he intends to appeal the decision to remand Madoff to jail .
A handful of his investor victims also spoke in court .
Victims of Madoff's Ponzi Scheme Speak
One victim , Mr. Nurenberg , upon coming up to the podium turned directly to face Madoff and asked him , " Have you looked at the victims in the courtroom ? "
Judge Chinn reprimanded him telling him sternly to direct himself to the judge .
Another victim , Maureen Evel , told the judge she wanted Madoff to face a trial , not be allowed to make a plea .
" We need to comprehend the global scope of this crime , " said Evel .
" No man , no matter who he knows , is above the law .
If we go to trial we have a chance to see the global scope of this scheme . "
Madoff insisted that the salaries and bonuses of his employees were paid by legitimate profits from his legitimate businesses .
Madoff arrived at the Manhattan courthouse earlier Thursday swarmed by media as five news choppers hovered overhead .
One victim who had shown up at the courthouse said , " I have nothing to say to the man I get sick just looking at him . "
Sentencing for Madoff has been set for June 16 , 2009 .
Madoff 's plea does not end the matter and the investigation into the vast scheme will continue .
Madoff is so far the only person charged in the purported fraud , but investigators continue to look for possible accomplices and have not ruled out his sons nor his wife , Ruth .
Madoff has insisted that he committed the massive fraud on his own .
Madoff will have to forfeit any proceeds from his scheme and that any property obtained from the scheme would also be seized .
So far , investigators have recovered about $ 950 million in cash and securities .
Ruth Madoff earlier told prosecutors that she should be allowed to stay in the couple 's $ 7 million Upper East Side penthouse in Manhattan and that she should be able to keep an additional $ 62 million in cash and bonds which she says are not connected to her husband 's alleged scam operation .

Preface
This page shows several examples of how code can be improved .
We try to derive general rules from them , though they cannot be applied deterministically and are a matter of taste .
We all know this , please do n't add " this is disputable " to each item !
Instead , you can now add " this is disputable " on / Discussion and change this page only when some sort of consensus is reached .
Be concise
Do n't reinvent the wheel
The standard libraries are full of useful , well - tuned functions .
If you rewrite an existing library function , the reader of your code might spend a minute trying to figure out why you 've done that .
But if you use a standard function , the reader will either immediately understand what you 've done , or can learn something new .
Avoid explicit recursion
Explicit recursion is not generally bad , but you should spend some time trying to find a more declarative implementation using higher order functions .
Do n't define
raise :: Num a => a -> [ a ] -> [ a ] raise _ [ ] = [ ] raise x ( y : ys ) = x + y : raise x ys
because it is hard for the reader to find out how much of the list is processed and on which values the elements of the output list depend .
Just write
raise x ys = map ( x + ) ys
or even
raise x = map ( x + )
and the reader knows that the complete list is processed and that each output element depends only on the corresponding input element .
If you do n't find appropriate functions in the standard library , extract a general function .
This helps you and others understand the program .
Thanks to higher order functions
Haskell gives you very many opportunities to factor out parts of the code .
If you find the function very general , put it in a separate module and re-use it .
It may appear in the standard libraries later , or you may later find that it is already there in an even more general way .
Decomposing a problem this way also has the advantage that you can debug more easily .
If the last implementation of raise does not show the expected behaviour , you can inspect map ( I hope it is correct :-) ) and the invoked instance of (+ ) separately .
This is a special case of the general principle of separating concerns .
If you can write the loop over a data structure once and debug it , then there 's no need to duplicate that code .
Another example : the function count counts the number of elements which fulfill a certain property , i.e. the elements for which the predicate p is True .
I found the following code ( but convoluted in a more specific function ) in a Haskell program
count :: ( a -> Bool ) -> [ a ] ->
Int count _ [ ] = 0 count p ( x : xs ) | p x = 1 + count p xs | otherwise = count p xs
which you wo n't like after you become aware of
count p = length .
filter p
.
Only introduce identifiers you need
Here is some advice that is useful for every language , including scientific prose ( http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD09xx/EWD993.html): Introduce only identifiers you use .
The compiler will check this for you if you pass an option like - Wall to GHC .
In an expression like
[ a | i <- [ 1 .. m ] ]
where a might be a horrible complex expression it is not easy to see , that a really does not depend on i .
replicate m a
is certainly better here .
Remember the zero
Do n't forget that zero is a natural number .
Recursive definitions become more complicated if the recursion anchor is not chosen properly .
For example the function tupel presented in DMV - Mitteilungen 2004 / 12 - 3 , Jürgen Bokowski : Haskell , ein gutes Werkzeug der Diskreten Mathematik ( Haskell , a good tool for discrete mathematics ) .
This is also a good example of how to avoid guards .
tuples :: Int -> [ a ] -> [ [ a ] ] tuples r l | r == 1 = [ [ el ] | el <- l ] | length l == r = [ l ] | otherwise = ( map ( [ head l ] ++ ) ( tuples ( r - 1 ) ( tail l ) ) ) ++ tuples r ( tail l )
Do you have an idea what it does ?
Let 's strip the guards and forget about list comprehension .
tuples :: Int -> [ a ] -> [ [ a ] ] tuples 1 l = map ( : [ ] ) l tuples r l = if r == length l then [ l ] else let t = tail l in map ( head l : ) ( tuples ( r - 1 ) t ) ++ tuples r t
What about tuples with zero elements ?
We can add the pattern
tuples 0 _ = [ [ ] ]
but then we can also omit the pattern for 1 - tuples .
tuples :: Int -> [ a ] -> [ [ a ] ] tuples 0 _ = [ [ ] ] tuples r l = if r == length l then [ l ] else let t = tail l in map ( head l : ) ( tuples ( r - 1 ) t ) ++ tuples r t
What about the case r > length l ?
Sure , no reason to let head fail - in that case there is no tuple , thus we return an empty list .
Again , this saves us one special case .
tuples :: Int -> [ a ] -> [ [ a ] ] tuples 0 _ = [ [ ] ] tuples r l = if r > length l then [ ] else let t = tail l in map ( head l : ) ( tuples ( r - 1 ) t ) ++ tuples r t
We have learnt above that length is evil !
What about
tuples :: Int -> [ a ] -> [ [ a ] ] tuples 0 _ = [ [ ] ] tuples _ [ ] = [ ] tuples r ( x : xs ) = map ( x : ) ( tuples ( r - 1 ) xs ) ++ tuples r xs
?
It is no longer necessary to compute the length of l again and again .
The code is easier to read and it covers all special cases , including tuples ( - 1 ) [ 1,2,3 ] !
Eliminating the length test can worsen performance dramatically in some cases , like tuples 24 [ 1..25 ] .
We could also use null ( drop ( r - 1 ) l ) instead of length l < r , which works for infinite lists .
See also below .
You can even save one direction of recursion by explicit computation of the list of all suffixes provided by tails .
You can do this with do notation
tuples :: Int -> [ a ] -> [ [ a ] ] tuples 0 _ = [ [ ] ] tuples r xs = do y : ys <- tails xs map ( y : ) ( tuples ( r - 1 ) ys )
Since ( = << ) in the list monad is concatMap , we can also write this as follows .
Where in the previous version the pattern y:ys filtered out the last empty suffix we have to do this manually now with init .
tuples :: Int -> [ a ] -> [ [ a ] ] tuples 0 _ = [ [ ] ] tuples r xs = concatMap ( \ ( y : ys ) -> map ( y : ) ( tuples ( r - 1 ) ys ) ) ( init ( tails xs ) )
The list of all suffixes could be generated with iterate tail but this ends with a " Prelude.tail : empty list " .
tails generates the suffixes in the same order but aborts properly .
More generally , Base cases and identities
Do n't overuse lambdas
Like explicit recursion , using explicit lambdas is n't a universally bad idea , but a better solution often exists .
For example , Haskell is quite good at currying .
Do n't write
zipWith ( \ x y -> f x y ) map ( \ x -> x + 42 )
instead , write
zipWith f map ( + 42 )
also , instead of writing
-- sort a list of strings case insensitively sortBy ( \ x y -> compare ( map toLower x ) ( map toLower y ) )
write
comparing p x y = compare ( p x ) ( p y ) sortBy ( comparing ( map toLower ) )
which is both clearer and re-usable .
Actually , starting with GHC - 6.6 you do not need to define comparing , since it is already in module Data .
Ord .
http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Data-Ord.html
( Just a remark for this special example :
We can avoid multiple evaluations of the conversions with a function that is present in GHC .
Exts of GHC 6.10 :
sortWith :: ( Ord b ) => ( a -> b ) -> [ a ] -> [ a ] sortWith f x = map snd ( sortBy ( comparing fst ) ( zip ( map f x ) x ) )
)
As a rule of thumb , once your expression becomes too long to easily be point - freed , it probably deserves a name anyway .
Lambdas are occasionally appropriate however , e.g. for control structures in monadic code ( in this example , a control - structure " foreach2 " which most languages do n't even support . ) :
foreach2 xs ys f = zipWithM_ f xs ys linify :: [ String ] -> IO ( ) linify lines = foreach2 [ 1 .. ] lines $ \ lineNr line -> do unless ( null line ) $ putStrLn $ shows lineNr $ showString " : " $ show line
Bool is a regular type
Logic expressions are not restricted to guards and if statements .
Avoid verbosity like in
isEven n | mod n 2 == 0 = True | otherwise = False
since it is the same as
isEven n = mod n 2 == 0
.
The definitions
has Space ( a : as ) | isSpace a =
True | otherwise = has Space as
and
has Space ( a : as ) = if isSpace a then True else has Space as
can be shortened to
has Space ( a : as ) = is Space a || has Space as
( I just wanted to show the logic transform .
In the particular example you would write any isSpace , of course . )
The same way
allPrintable ( a : as ) | isSpace a = False | otherwise = all Printable as
and
allPrintable ( a : as ) = if isSpace a then False else all Printable as
can be shortened to
all Printable ( a : as ) = not ( is Space a ) && all Printable as
( but all ( not . is Space ) is even better in this particular example . )
Use syntactic sugar wisely
People who employ syntactic sugar extensively argue that it makes their code more readable .
The following sections show several examples where less syntactic sugar is more readable .
It is argued that a special notation is often more intuitive than a purely functional expression .
But the term " intuitive notation " is always a matter of habit .
You can also develop an intuition for analytic expressions that do n't match your habits at the first glance .
So why not making a habit of less sugar sometimes ?
List comprehension
List comprehension lets you remain in imperative thinking , that is it lets you think in variables rather than transformations .
Open your mind , discover the flavour of the pointfree style !
Instead of
[ toUpper c | c <- s ]
write
map toUpper s
.
Consider
[ toUpper c | s <- strings , c <- s ]
where it takes some time for the reader to discover which value depends on what other value and it is not so clear how many times the interim values s and c are used .
In contrast to that
map toUpper ( concat strings )
ca n't be clearer .
When using higher order functions you can switch more easily from List to other data structures .
Compare
map ( 1 + ) list
and
mapSet ( 1 + ) set
.
If there were a standard instance for the Functor class you could use the code
fmap ( 1 + ) pool
for both choices .
If you are not used to higher order functions for list processing you may feel you need parallel list comprehension .
This is unfortunately supported by GHC now , but it is arguably superfluous since various flavours of zip already do a great job .
do notation
do notation is useful to express the imperative nature ( e.g. a hidden state or an order of execution ) of a piece of code .
Nevertheless it 's sometimes useful to remember that the do notation is explained in terms of functions .
Instead of
do text <- readFile " foo " write
File " bar " text
one can write
readFile " foo " >>= write
File " bar "
.
The code
do text <- readFile " foo " return text
can be simplified to
readFile " foo "
by a law that each Monad must fulfill .
You certainly also agree that
do text <- readFile " foobar " return ( lines text )
is more complicated than
liftM lines ( readFile " foobar " )
.
By the way , the Functor class method fmap and the Monad based function liftM are the same ( as long as both are defined , as they should be ) .
Be aware that " more complicated " does not imply " worse " .
If your do - expression was longer than this , then mixing do - notation and fmap might be precisely the wrong thing to do , because it adds one more thing to think about .
Be natural .
Only change it if you gain something by changing it .

Guards
Disclaimer :
This section is NOT advising you to avoid guards .
It is advising you to prefer pattern matching to guards when both are appropriate .
-- AndrewBromage
Guards look like
-- Bad implementation : fac :: Integer ->
Integer fac n | n == 0 = 1 | n /= 0 = n * fac ( n - 1 )
which implements a factorial function .
This example , like a lot of uses of guards , has a number of problems .
The first problem is that it 's nearly impossible for the compiler to check whether guards like this are exhaustive , as the guard conditions may be arbitrarily complex ( GHC will warn you if you use the - Wall option ) .
To avoid this problem and potential bugs through non exhaustive patterns you should use an otherwise guard , that will match for all remaining cases :
-- Slightly improved implementation : fac :: Integer ->
Integer fac n | n == 0 = 1 | otherwise = n * fac ( n - 1 )
Another reason to prefer this one is its greater readability for humans and optimizability for compilers .
Though it may not matter much in a simple case like this , when seeing an otherwise it 's immediately clear that it 's used whenever the previous guard fails , which is n't true if the " negation of the previous test " is spelled out .
The same applies to the compiler :
It probably will be able to optimize an otherwise ( which is a synonym for True ) away but cannot do that for most expressions .
This can be done with even less sugar using if ,
-- Less sugar ( though the verbosity of if - then - else can also be considered as sugar :-) fac :: Integer ->
Integer fac n = if n == 0 then 1 else n * fac ( n - 1 )
Note that if has its own set of problems , for example in connection with the layout rule or that nested if s are difficult to read .
See Case how to avoid nested if s .
But in this special case , the same can be done even more easily with pattern matching :
-- Good implementation : fac :: Integer ->
Integer fac 0 = 1 fac n = n * fac ( n - 1 )
Actually , in this case there is an even more easier to read version , which ( see above ) does n't use Explicit Recursion :
-- Excellent implementation : fac :: Integer ->
Integer fac n = product [ 1 .. n ]
This may also be more efficient as product might be optimized by the library - writer ...
In GHC , when compiling with optimizations turned on , this version runs in O ( 1 ) stack - space , whereas the previous versions run in O ( n ) stack - space .
Note however , that there is a difference between this version and the previous ones :
When given a negative number , the previous versions do not terminate ( until StackOverflow - time ) , while the last implementation returns 1 .
Guards do n't always make code clearer .
Compare
foo xs | not ( null xs ) = bar ( head xs )
and
foo ( x : _ ) = bar x
or compare the following example using the advanced pattern guards
parseCmd ln | Left err <- parse cmd " Commands " ln = BadCmd $ unwords $ lines $ show err | Right x <- parse cmd " Commands " ln = x
with this one with no pattern guards :
parseCmd ln = case parse cmd " Commands " ln of Left err ->
BadCmd $ unwords $ lines $ show err Right x -> x
or , if you expect your readers to be familiar with the either function :
parseCmd :: -- add an explicit type signature , as this is now a pattern binding parseCmd = either ( BadCmd .
unwords .
lines .
show ) id .
parse cmd " Commands "
Incidentally , compilers often also have problems with numerical patterns .
For example , the pattern 0 in fact means from Integer 0 ; thus it involves a computation , which is uncommon for function parameter patterns .
To illustrate this , consider the following example :
data Foo =
Foo deriving ( Eq , Show ) instance Num Foo where from Integer = error " forget it " f :: Foo ->
Bool f 42 = True f _ = False
* Main > f 42 *** Exception : forget it
Only use guards when you need to .
In general , you should stick to pattern matching whenever possible .
n + k patterns
In order to allow pattern matching against numerical types , Haskell 98 provides so - called n+k patterns , as in
take :: Int -> [ a ] -> [ a ] take ( n + 1 ) ( x : xs ) = x : take n xs take _ _ = [ ]
However , they are often criticized for hiding computational complexity and producing ambiguities , see / Discussion for details .
They are subsumed by the more general Views proposal , which has unfortunately never been implemented despite being around for quite some time now .
The n+k patterns are not in the Haskell 2010 standard .
Efficiency and infinity
A rule of thumb is :
If a function makes sense for an infinite data structure but the implementation at hand fails for an infinite amount of data , then the implementation is probably also inefficient for finite data .
Do n't ask for the length of a list when you do n't need it
Do n't write
length x == 0
to find out if the list x is empty .
If you write it , you force Haskell to create all list nodes .
It fails on an infinite list although the expression should be evaluated to False in this case .
( Nevertheless the content of the list elements may not be evaluated . )
In contrast
x == [ ]
is faster but it requires the list x to be of type [ a ] where a is a type of class Eq .
The best thing to do is
null x
length
atLeast
atLeast :: Int -> [ a ] ->
Bool atLeast 0 _ = True atLeast _ [ ] = False atLeast n ( _ : ys ) = atLeast ( n - 1 ) ys
Additionally , many uses of the length function are overspecifying the problem : one may only need to check that a list isa certain length , and not a specific length .
Thus use ofcould be replaced with anfunction that only checks to see that a list is greater than the required minimum length .
or non-recursive , but less efficient because both length and take must count
atLeast :: Int -> [ a ] ->
Bool atLeast n x = n == length ( take n x )
or non-recursive but fairly efficient
atLeast :: Int -> [ a ] ->
Bool atLeast n = if n > 0 then not .
null .
drop ( n - 1 ) else const True
or
atLeast :: Int -> [ a ] ->
Bool atLeast 0 = const True atLeast n = not .
null .
drop ( n - 1 )
The same problem arises if you want to shorten a list to the length of another one by
take ( length x ) y
since this is inefficient for large lists x and fails for infinite ones .
But this can be useful to extract a finite prefix from an infinite list .
So , instead
zipWith const y x
works well .
It should be noted that length , take can be replaced by genericLength , genericTake et.al. , which allow the usage of Peano numbers .
Do n't ask for the minimum when you do n't need it
The function isLowerLimit checks if a number is a lower limit to a sequence .
isLowerLimit :: Ord a => a -> [ a ] ->
Bool isLowerLimit x ys = x <= minimum ys
It certainly fails if ys is infinite .
Is this a problem ?
Compare it with
isLowerLimit x = all ( x <= )
This definition terminates for infinite lists , if x is not a lower limit .
It aborts immediately if an element is found which is below x .
Thus it is also faster for finite lists .
Even more :
It also works for empty lists .
Use sharing
If you want a list of lists with increasing length and constant content , do n't write
map ( flip replicate x ) [ 0 .. ]
because this needs quadratic space and run-time .
If you code
iterate ( x : ) [ ]
then the lists will share their suffixes and thus need only linear space and run-time for creation .
Choose the appropriate fold
See " Stack overflow " or " Foldr Foldl Foldl ' " for advice on which fold is appropriate for your situation .
Choose types properly
Lists are not good for everything
Lists are not arrays
Lists are not arrays , so do n't treat them as such .
Frequent use of ( !!) should alarm you .
Accessing the n th list element involves traversing through the first n nodes of the list .
This is very inefficient .
If you access the elements progressively , as in
[ x !!
i - i | i <- [ 0 .. n ] ]
you should try to get rid of indexing , as in
zipWith ( - ) x [ 0 .. n ]
.
If you really need random access , as in the Fourier Transform , you should switch to Arrays .
Lists are not sets
If you manage data sets where each object can occur only once and the order is irrelevant , if you use list functions like sort , nub , union , elem , delete , ( \\ ) frequently , you should think about switching to sets .
If you need multi-sets , i.e. data sets with irrelevant order but multiple occurrences of objects , you can use a Data .
Map .
Map a Int .
Lists are not finite maps
Similarly , lists are not finite maps , as mentioned in efficiency hints .
Reduce type class constraints
Eq type class
When using functions like delete , ( \\ ) , nub , and so on you should be aware that they need types of the Eq class .
There are two problems :
The routines might not work as expected if a processed list contains multiple equal elements and the element type of the list may not be comparable , like functions .
Example :
The following function takes the input list xs and removes each element of xs once from xs .
Clear what it does ?
No ?
The code is probably more understandable
removeEach :: ( Eq a ) => [ a ] -> [ [ a ] ] removeEach xs = map ( flip List .
delete xs ) xs
but it should be replaced by
removeEach :: [ a ] -> [ [ a ] ] removeEach xs = zipWith ( ++ ) ( List . inits xs ) ( tail ( List . tails xs ) )
since this works perfectly for function types a and for equal elements in xs .
Do n't use
Int when you do n't consider integers
Before using integers for each and everything ( C style ) think of more specialised types .
If only the values 0 and 1 are of interest , try the type Bool instead .
If there are more but predefined choices and numeric operations are n't needed try an enumeration .
Instead of
type Weekday = Int
write
data Weekday = Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Saturday | Sunday deriving ( Eq , Ord , Enum )
It allows all sensible operations like == , < , succ and forbids all nonsensical ones like + , * .
You cannot accidentally mix up weekdays with numbers and the signature of a function with weekday parameter clearly states what kind of data is expected .
If an enumeration is not appropriate you can define a newtype carrying the type that is closest to what you need .
E.g. if you want to associate objects with a unique identifier , you may want to choose the type Int .
But you do n't need arithmetic and you can make this type distinct from real Int s by defining
newtype Identifier = Identifier Int deriving Eq
Avoid redundancy in data types
I often see data types with redundant fields , e.g .
data XML = Element Position Name [ Attribute ] [ XML ] | Comment Position String | Text Position String
I suggest to factor out the common field Position since this lets you handle the text position the same way for all XML parts .
data XML = XML Position Part data Part = Element Name [ Attribute ] [ XML ] | Comment String | Text String
Miscellaneous
Separate IO and data processing
It 's not good to use the IO Monad everywhere , much of the data processing can be done without IO interaction .
You should separate data processing and IO because pure data processing can be done purely functionally , that is you do n't have to specify an order of execution and you do n't have to worry about what computations are actually necessary .
Useful techniques are described in Avoiding IO .
Forget about quot and rem
They complicate handling of negative dividends .
div and mod are almost always the better choice .
If b > 0 then it always holds
a == b * div a b + mod a b mod a b < b mod a b >= 0
The first equation is true also for quot and rem , but the two others are true only for mod , but not for rem .
That is , mod a b always wraps a to an element from [ 0 .. ( b - 1 ) ] , whereas the sign of rem a b depends on the sign of a .
This seems to be more an issue of experience rather than one of a superior reason .
You might argue , that the sign of the dividend is more important for you , than that of the divisor .
However , I have never seen such an application , but many uses of quot and rem where div and mod were clearly superior .

Partial functions like fromJust and head
Avoid functions that fail for certain input values like fromJust and head .
They raise errors that can only be detected at runtime .
Think about how they can be avoided by different program organization or by choosing more specific types .
Instead of
if i == Nothing then deflt else fromJust i
write
fromMaybe deflt i
Please note , that ( == ) also requires an Eq class instance for the type of i , which from Maybe does not require because it employs pattern matching .
See also # Reduce type class constraints .
If it is not possible to avoid fromJust this way , then use from Maybe anyway and document with an error why you think that the value must be always Just in your situation .
fromMaybe ( error " Function bla :
The list does always contains the searched value " ) ( lookup key dict )
The function head can be avoided by checking with types , that it is never empty .
There is also a function which returns an existing first list element in terms of Maybe : maybeToList

Common Mistakes and Incorrect Beliefs By Haskell Beginners
Ever since Microsoft started to share early versions of Windows 7 with the world last October , the response has been , for the most part , pretty darn enthusiastic .
At least when it comes to folks who blog , write for magazines , and otherwise have soapboxes to speak from .
But vast quantities of civilian Windows users –including quite a few Technologizer community members –downloaded and installed the Windows 7 beta during the time it was available .
I wanted to give more of these savvy laypeople a chance to share their experiences and impressions .
So a couple of weeks ago , we launched a survey ( using PollDaddy ’s excellent service ) to let them speak out .
And the results are in .
In the end , they are n’t startling : Most of our survey respondents like what they ’ve seen of Windows 7 so far .
They reported surprisingly few technical problems considering it ’s a beta , and most of them liked most of the OS ’s new and improved features .
Really liked them , in many cases
Background / disclaimers : A little over 200 people took the survey .
We did n’t screen them or capture demographic info .
You might argue that folks who are interested enough in Windows 7 to go through the trouble of installing it now would be more predisposed to like it than the teeming masses who wo n’t give it any thought until it ships .
You might also point out that it ’s possible that the beta makes a better impression than the final version will , once it ’s installed on shipping PCs and in some cases larded up with unnecessaryware .
You may well be right .
But that ’s okay :
The goal of this survey is to see what people who have actually used the OS in its first public form think .
And hey , once Windows 7 does ship , we can field another survey .
Probably will , in fact .
The report that follows is divided into four parts ; here are links to all of them in case you feel like skipping ahead …
Part one : The Basics : Usage , Setup , Glitches
Part two : Feature - by - Feature Feedback
Part three : Windows 7 vs. the Competition
Part four : The Bottom Line and Verbatim Feedback
The Basics : Usage , Setup , Glitches
Most respondents told us they ’d banged away at the Windows 7 beta enough to get a good sense of its pros and cons– 87 percent said they ’d used it extensively or a fair amount :
Even shipping operating systems have been known to fail to install on a surprising percentage of PCs .
But for a beta , Windows 7 installed on most respondents ’ computers without much hassle .
Actually , 90 percent of respondents said they had no trouble installing it at all .
Eight percent said they encountered a non-serious issue , and two percent had to deal with a severe setup issue .
Once the OS was on the computer , the most common problems folks found by far were missing drivers and apps that would n’t run–reported by 23 and 22 percent of respondents , respectively .
Thirteen percent reported features that did n’t work as expected or crashes / blue screens .
All other issues appeared to be rare –including poor performance .
( 94 percent of respondents were apparently satisfied by how fast the Windows 7 beta ran . )

Baseline Scenario for 2/9/2009 ( 11 pm edition , February 8 ) : link to pdf version
Peter Boone , Simon Johnson , and James Kwak , copyright of the authors .
Summary
1 ) The world is heading into a severe slump , with declining output in the near term and no clear turnaround in sight .
We forecast a contraction of minus 1 percent in the world economy in 2009 ( on a Q4 - to - Q4 basis ) , making this by far the worst year for the global economy since the Great Depression .
We further project no recovery on the horizon , so worldwide 2010 will be “ flat ” relative to 2009 .
2 ) Consumers in the US and the nonfinancial corporate sector everywhere are trying to “ rebuild their balance sheets , ” which means they want to save more and spend less .
3 ) Governments have only a limited ability to offset this increase in desired private sector savings through dissaving ( i.e. , increased budget deficits that result from fiscal stimulus ) .
Even the most prudent governments in industrialized countries did not run sufficiently countercyclical fiscal policy during the boom and now face balance sheet constraints .
The U.S. will provide a moderate fiscal stimulus in 2009 and 2010 , amounting to about 2 percent of GDP in each year .
4 ) The forthcoming ( due this week ) attempt to deal with banking system problems in the US will be insufficiently forceful .
The structure of executive compensation caps introduced last week suggests the Obama Administration currently is unwilling to take on the large banks politically .
The degree of recapitalization will be too small and the measures will help existing management stay in place .
Large banks will remain “ too big to fail ” and shareholders will still be unable to constrain executive compensation .
Lending will remain anemic .
5 ) Compounding these problems is a serious test for the Eurozone : financial market pressure on Greece , Ireland and Italy is mounting ; Portugal and Spain are also likely to be affected .
The global financial sector weakness has become a potential fiscal issue of the first order in these countries .
This will lead to another round of bailouts in Europe , this time for weaker sovereigns in the Eurozone .
As a result , fiscal policy will be even less countercyclical , i.e. , governments will feel the need to attempt precautionary austerity , which amounts to a further increase in savings .
6 ) At the same time , the situation in emerging markets is moving sharply towards near - crisis , particularly as global trade contracts and there are immediate effects on both corporates and the financial system .
Currency collapse and debt default will be averted only by fiscal austerity .
The current IMF strategy – most clearly evident in East - Central Europe – is to protect creditors fully with programs that do not allow for nominal exchange rate depreciation .
This approach increases the degree of contraction and social costs faced by domestic residents , while also making economic recovery more difficult .
These programs will likely prove more unpopular and less successful than were similar programs in Latin America in the 1980s and in Asia in the 1990s .
As East - Central Europe slips into deeper recession , there are severe negative consequences for West European banks with a high exposure to the region ( including Austria , Sweden and Greece ) .
7 ) The global situation is analogous to the problem of Japan in the 1990s , in which corporates attempted to repair their balance sheets while consumers continued to save as before and fiscal stimulus repeatedly proved insufficient .
The difference , of course , is that exports were able to grow and Japan could run a current account surplus ; this does not work at a global level .
Global growth prospects are therefore no better than for Japan in the 1990s .
8 ) A rapid return to growth requires more expansionary monetary policy , and in all likelihood this needs to be led by the United States .
But the Federal Reserve is still some distance from fully recognizing deflation and , by the time it takes that view and can implement appropriate actions , declining wages and prices will be built into expectations , thus making it much harder to stabilize the housing market and restart growth .
The European Central Bank still fails to recognize the seriousness of the economic situation .
The Bank of England is embarked on a full - fledged anti-deflation policy , but economic prospects in the UK still remain dire .
9 ) The push to re-regulate , which is the focus of the G20 intergovernmental process ( with the next summit set for April 2 ) , could lead to a potentially dangerous procyclical set of policies that can exacerbate the downturn and prolong the recovery .
There is currently nothing on the G20 agenda that will help slow the global decline and start a recovery .
The Obama Administration will have a hard time bringing its G20 partners to a more pro-recovery policy stance .
10 ) The most likely outcome is not a V - shaped recovery ( which is the current official consensus ) or a U - shaped recovery ( which is closer to the private sector consensus ) , but rather an L , in which there is a steep fall and then a struggle to recover .
A “ lost decade ” for the world economy is quite possible .
There will be some episodes of incipient recovery , as there were in Japan during the 1990s , but this will prove very hard to sustain .
Background
The current official consensus view ( e.g. , as seen in the World Bank ’s Global Economic Prospects , the OECD ’s leading indicators , or the latest IMF World Economic Outlook ) is that we are having a serious downturn , with annualized growth for the fourth quarter in the US at around minus 4 % .
But the consensus is that a recovery will be underway by late 2009 in the US and shortly thereafter in the Eurozone .
This will help bring up growth in emerging markets and developing countries , so by 2010 global growth will be moving back towards its 2006 - 2007 rates .
Our baseline view is considerably more negative .
While we agree that a rapid fall is underway and the speed of this is unusual , we do not yet see the mechanisms through which a turnaround occurs .
In fact , in our baseline view there is considerably more decline in global output already in the works and , once the situation stabilizes , it is hard to see how a recovery can easily be sustained .
The consensus view focuses on disruptions to the supply of credit and recognizes official attempts to support this supply .
In contrast , we emphasize that the crisis of confidence from mid-September has now had profound effects on the demand for credit and its counterpart , desired savings , everywhere in the world .
To explain our position , we first briefly review the background to today ’s situation .
( Readers who would like more detail on what happened in and since mid-September should refer to the November 10 edition of our baseline scenario . )
We then review both the current situation and the likely prognosis for policy in major economies and for key categories of countries .
While a great deal remains uncertain about economic outcomes , much of the likely policy mix around the world has become clearer .
We conclude by reviewing the prospects for sustained growth and linking the likely vulnerabilities to structural weaknesses in the global system , including both the role played by the financial sector almost everywhere and the way in which countries ’ financial sectors interact .
In the end we come full circle – tomorrow ’s dangers can be linked directly back to the underlying causes of today ’s crisis .
Understanding the Crisis
The precipitating cause of today ’s global recession was a severe “ credit crisis , ” but one that is frequently misunderstood in several ways .
1 . While the US housing bubble played a role in the formation of the crisis and continued housing problems remain an issue , the boom was and the bust is much broader .
This was a synchronized debt - financed global boom , facilitated by flows of capital around the world .
2 . In particular , while the US boom was at the epicenter of the crisis , regulated European financial institutions played a critical role in facilitating the boom and spreading the adverse consequences worldwide .
And , like the US , some European governments ran relatively irresponsible fiscal policies during the boom , making them now unable to bail out their financial systems without creating concerns about sovereign solvency .
3 . The boom exacerbated financial system vulnerability everywhere .
But the crisis in the current form was not inevitable .
The severity of today ’s crisis is a direct result of the failure to bail out Lehman and the way in which AIG was “ saved ” – so that senior creditors took large losses and confidence in the credit system was shaken much more broadly .
4 . The initial problem , from mid-September 2008 , was a fall in the supply of credit .
But this does not mean that the current and likely pending official support for credit supply will turn the situation around .
Now the crisis has affected the demand side – people and firms want to pay down their debts and increase their precautionary savings .
5 . There is no “ right ” level of debt , so we do n’t know where “ deleveraging ” ( i.e. , the fall in demand for and supply of credit ) will end .
Debt could stabilize where we are now or it could be much lower .
Leverage levels are very hard for policy to affect directly , as they result from millions of decentralized decisions about how much people borrow .
Anyone with high levels of debt in any market economy is now re-evaluating how much debt is reasonable for the medium - term .
6 . As a result , while attempts to clean up and recapitalize the US and European financial systems make sense – and are needed to support any eventual recovery – this will not immediately stop the process of financial contraction and economic decline .
7. Fiscal stimulus , similarly , can soften the blow of the recession , but will not directly address the underlying problems .
And many countries already face binding constraints on what their governments can do in this regard .
8 . A dramatic shift in the stance of monetary policy is required in almost all industrialized countries and emerging markets .
Unfortunately , the need for this shift is not currently recognized by official orthodoxy and it is not yet clear when this will change .
The Global Situation Today
United States
Perhaps the most fundamental barrier to economic recovery in the US is the weakness of balance sheets in the private sector .
Households did not save much since the mid-1990s and reduced their savings further this decade , in part because of the increase in house prices ; this was the counterpart of the large increase in the US current account deficit .
Desired household saving is now increasing .
The main dynamic is a fall in credit demand rather than constraints on credit supply in the US .
The US corporate sector is in better shape but , faced with the disruptions of the last three months , is also seeking to pay down debt and conserve cash .
Even entities with deep pockets , strong balance sheets and long investment horizons ( e.g. , universities , private equity ) are cutting back on spending and trying to strengthen their balance sheets .
This desire to save is causing major reductions in both consumption and private investment , creating the economic contraction we see all around us .
There are three major categories of potential policy responses : fiscal , financial , and monetary .
However , each of them faces real constraints .
First , a substantial fiscal stimulus is already in train .
The constraints on this dimension are , first , the ability of the Republican opposition to block legislation in the Senate and , second , the US balance sheet .
The US balance sheet is strong relative to most other industrialized countries – private sector holdings of government debt are around 40 % of GDP .
But the US authorities also have to worry about increasing Social Security and Medicare payments in the medium term , and so are reluctant to accumulate too much debt .
The underlying problem is that fiscal policy was not sufficiently counter - cyclical during the boom .
The federal fiscal stimulus will be helpful , but it will not be enough to prevent a substantial decline or quickly turn around the economy .
One view is that US government debt remains the ultimate safe haven , and this is surely true in general terms – particularly in moments of high stress .
But this excellent recent presentation by John Campbell should give us pause ( technical paper here ) .
His point is that while US long bonds go through episodes when they are good hedges against prevalent risks ( e.g. , now and in the recent past ) , this is not always true .
In particular , if inflation becomes an issue – think 1970s – then long bonds are really quite risky , in both popular and technical meanings of risk .
You may think your bond holdings are a great hedge , but in fact they are a fairly substantial gamble that inflation will not jump upwards .
Campbell ’s worries fit with the recent creeping upwards of the yield on 10 - year US government bonds , from near 2 % towards 3 % over the past 2 months .
We ’re supportive of the fiscal stimulus , at the currently proposed level , and we also strongly support the view that cleaning up the banking system properly will add further to our national debt – probably in the region of 10 - 20 % of GDP , when all is said and done .
( While this seems like a lot , Linda Bilmes and Nobel Laureate Joseph Stiglitz have estimated the long - term cost of the Iraq War at $ 3 trillion which , although this may be on the high end , is over 20 % of GDP . )
And we further agree that some form of housing refinance program will help slow foreclosures , and this should further increase the chances that the financial system stabilizes .
But all of this adds up .
US government debt held by the private sector will probably rise , as a percentage of GDP , from around 41 % to somewhere above 70 % .
This is still manageable , but it should concentrate our minds – we do not agree that the impact of the fiscal stimulus will be adverse , but we agree the US government fiscal position could become more precarious down the road .
The net effect of our financial fiasco is to push us towards European - style government debt levels , and this obviously presses us further to reform ( i.e. , spend less on ) Social Security and Medicare .
And we really need to make sure we do n’t have another fiasco of similar magnitude any time in the near future .
Second , financial sector policy has not been encouraging .
Despite a series of efforts that were both heroic and chaotic , the banking sector today is roughly in the same state it was in after the collapse of Lehman in September : investors do not trust bank balance sheets , further writedowns are expected , and stock prices are above zero mainly because of the option value of a successful government rescue .
Looking at the banks more directly , there are no easy answers .
Dramatic bank recapitalization remains controversial because this would imply effective nationalization , which is not appealing to Wall Street ( and to many on Main Street ) .
The original TARP terms from mid-October are no longer available , as they were very generous to banks and there is widespread backlash against bailouts .
Also , the latest Citigroup bailout ( from mid-November ) , recently repeated for Bank of America , is not appealing as an approach for the entire financial system as this was an even worse deal for the taxpayer .
A clever financial engineering - type approach of ring - fencing bad assets , with some sort of government guarantee , is unlikely to provide a decisive breakthrough .
And a long laundry list of measures ( “ try everything ” ) , each of which is insufficient , does not add up to a comprehensive approach unless and until it fully recapitalizes the banking system .
In fact , a relatively complex and opaque approach to what is really a simple problem – the chronic lack of capital in the banking system – could well generate the ( accurate ) impression that the bankers are availing themselves of a nontransparent approach and in effect stealing resources from the state .
This is the kind of behavior more commonly seen at such scale in a troubled developing economy , and while it does not preclude episodes of growth , it is usually associated with repeated crises , widening inequality and – eventually – social / political instability .
Our baseline view is that the government launches a medium - scale bank recapitalization and balance sheet clean - up scheme .
This will not be enough to really turn around the situation in US banking .
But it could temporarily bolster confidence in the US banking system , causing a rise in equity prices for banks ( as the market expects more government subsidies ) and – most important – a strengthening of debt , both for banks and perhaps for leading nonbank corporates .
Three international consequences seem likely .
1 ) This move forces the rest of the G7/G10 and the Eurozone to do the same , or something very similar .
If we have government - backed banks in the US and somewhat more dubious banks anywhere in other industrialized countries , money will flow into the stronger US banks .
Think back to the consequences of the original infectious blanket guarantees in Ireland in October ; the effects now would be similar .
You can think of the UK ’s upcoming moves either as a smart way to get ahead of this , or as something that will further a destabilizing wave of competitive recapitalizations – the policy is good , but doing it without coordination across countries cantrigger Iceland - type situations .
2 ) If all major economies need to back the balance sheets of their banks , then we have converted our myriad banking sector problems into a single ( per country ) fiscal issue .
Who has sufficient resources to fully back their banks ?
This obviously depends on ( a ) initial government debt , ( b ) size of banks ( and their problem loans , global and local ) , and ( c ) underlying budget deficit .
Ireland and Greece will be in the line of fire , but other weaker Eurozone countries will also face renewed pressure .
Officials are currently trying to work through this predictive analysis , and there is some thinking about preemptive preparations , but events are moving too fast - and the international policy community again ca n’t keep up .
3 ) In some countries – particularly emerging markets but also perhaps some richer countries – the foreign exchange exposure of banks will matter .
Here the issue will be whether the government has enough reserves to back ( or buy out ) these liabilities ; the problems of Russia since September foreshadow thisfor awide range of countries .
The absolute scale of reserves does not matter as much as whether they fully cover bank debt in foreign currency .
Most emerging markets face significant difficulties and need some form of external support in this scenario , particularly as both commodity and manufactured exports from these countries will continue to fall .
If , by good fortune , the US and global recession is already at its deepest – as some in the private sector now hold – then we face a tough situation but the difficulties are manageable .
However , our baseline view remains that the real economy is not yet stabilized , and hence we will see worse outcomes in Q1 and Q2 of 2009 than currently expected by the consensus .
Such outcomes are not yet reflected in asset prices , and the problems for banks – and the implications for fiscal sustainability – around the world will mount .
We will need to readdress the need to fully recapitalize the banks , but really making progress with this depends on a political willingness to take on the powerful banking lobby .
Third , monetary policy can still make a difference .
In particular , we risk entering a deflationary spiral with falling prices and downward pressure on nominal wages .
The inflation swap market currently implies minus 0.3 % average annual inflation for the next two years ( although the five - year expectation is for inflation at 1.5 % per year ) .
Deflation is not yet completely entrenched , so it is still possible to turn the situation around .
However , the Fed has not yet settled on the view that deflation is the main issue , and there is no internal consensus in favor of printing money ( or focusing on increasing the monetary base ) .
Generating positive inflation in this environment is not easy .
One way would be to talk down the dollar .
The fact that this would feed into inflation is not a danger but a help in this context .
Unfortunately , this would be seen as too much of a break from the tradition of a “ strong dollar ” and it would likely upset both Wall Street and US allies .
Ultimately , probably later in 2009 ( and definitely by early 2010 ) , the US will move to a more expansionary monetary policy and manage to generate inflation ; a more explicit form of inflation targeting is also likely to be introduced .
This will weaken the dollar and put pressure on other countries to follow suit – expansionary monetary policy is infectious in a way that expansionary fiscal policy is not .
The net effect on the dollar , of course , depends on how bad the situation is in other regions , particularly the Eurozone .
Western Europe
Major Western European countries , beginning with the UK , have been severely affected by the global recession .
The composite of forecasts tracked by Bloomberg predicts a contraction of 3 % in GDP not only for the UK , whose housing bubble and degree of dependence on the financial sector were arguably greater than in the US , but even in Germany , whose exports are under severe pressure ; their cars , machinery , and similar durables have a great reputation , but how many of them do customers really need to buy this quarter ?
The Eurozone as a whole is expected to contract by over 2 % .
In the UK , the prospect of further bank nationalization now looms .
The UK is an AAA - rated sovereign with its housing market in a nose dive , overextended ( and apparently mismanaged ) major banks , and a government on its way to guaranteeing all financial liabilities and directing the flow of credit moving forward .
The emerging strategy is based more on depreciating the pound – which is contributing to tensions with other European countries – and surprising people with inflation than on fully - funded bank recapitalization .
Additional fiscal stimulus increasingly looks irrelevant and perhaps even destabilizing .
The yield on 10 - year government bonds is , of course rising – now over 3.5 % .
Pressures on individual governments are even greater in some parts of the Eurozone , where individual countries do not have control over monetary policy .
Greece faces the most immediate problems , as demonstrated both by widening credit default swap spreads and increasing spreads of Greek bonds over German government bonds .
The cost of servicing Greek government debt is thus rising at the same time as Greece has to roll over debt worth around 20 percent of GDP in the coming year .
Greece has a debt - to - GDP ratio that is close to 100 percent , so there is real risk of default .
Recognizing that credit ratings are a lagging but not meaningless indicator , Greece ’s downgrade was not unexpected , but Spain ’s downgrade from AAA is a significant milestone .
Further European downgrades are in the air .
What do all these situations have in common ?
Markets are repricing the risk of lending to a wide range of governments .
And this is not just about emerging markets ( East - Central Europe ) or industrialized countries that sustained a boom based on euro convergence ( Portugal , Ireland , Italy , Greece and Spain are now known collectively in the financial markets as the PIIGS ) .
The markets are potentially rethinking the risk of any government ’s obligations .
The reaction that one hears from senior European officials and richer Eurozone countries is that Greece ( and Spain and Italy and others ) should deal with their fiscal problems themselves .
There is very little sympathy .
However , we expect that in the end Greece will receive a bailout from other Eurozone countries ( and probably from the EU ) .
This , however , does not come early enough to prevent problems from spreading to Ireland and other smaller countries ( which then also need to implement fiscal austerity or to receive support ) .
Italy is also likely to come under pressure , due to its high debt levels , and here there will be no way other than austerity .
With or without a bailout , Greece and other weaker euro sovereigns will need to implement fiscal austerity .
The net result is less fiscal stimulus than would otherwise be possible , and in fact there is a move to austerity among stronger euro sovereigns as a signal .
Governments will therefore struggle to dissave enough to offset the increase in private sector savings .
What are the implications for German debt ?
There is no question that Germany will do whatever it takes to maintain a reputation for fiscal prudence .
Despite the severe downturn , the German government recently struggled to pass a stimulus package of only 2.5 % of GDP over two years , and the pressure now is to balance the budget .
But problems in the Eurozone are putting pressure on the European Central Bank ( ECB ) to loosen its policies ( and there are murmurs already about easing repo-rules as credit ratings fall – basically , supporting euro sovereigns during their downward spiral ) , and this has implications for currency risk .
Despite the pressure to relax monetary policy , the ECB will continue to be slow to respond .
The ECB ’s decision - making process seeks consensus and some key members are still more worried about inflation down the road than deflation today .
The ECB ’s benchmark rate is still at 2 % .
Eventually the ECB will catch up , but not before there has been considerable further slowing in the Eurozone .
The current consensus forecast is that the Eurozone will start to recover in mid-2009 and be well on its way to achieving potential growth rates again by early 2010 .
This seems quite implausible as a baseline view .
Japan
The yen has appreciated as carry trades have unwound , so people no longer borrow in yen to invest elsewhere .
This , in addition to the global recession , has had a crippling effect on exports , which fell by 35 % from December 2007 to December 2008 .
Corporates are likely to want to strengthen their balance sheets further and households with already - high savings rates are unlikely to go on a spending spree .
As a result of these factors , the Bank of Japan recently predicted that the country will suffer two years of economic contraction and deflation .
The government ’s balance sheet is weak , but it is funded domestically ( in yen , willingly bought by households ) , so there is room for further fiscal expansion .
However , this is unlikely to come quickly .
The ability of the Japanese central bank to create inflation has proved limited .
Once deflationary expectations are established , these are hard to break .
In the inflation swap market , the average annual rate of inflation expected recently over five years is around minus 2.4 % , and an astonishing minus 1.0 % over 30 years .
This difficulty in creating positive inflation expectations will make it harder for any fiscal stimulus to be successful in restarting the economy .
Overall , it is difficult to see Japan being a major contributor to global growth .
China
The current crisis has shown that China ’s economy is far from invulnerable .
The 6.8 % year - over - year growth rate in Q4 may have implied that the quarter - over - quarter growth rate was around zero , and forecasts for 2009 are in the 6 - 8 % range – below the level commonly understood as the minimum to avoid growth in unemployment .
The major increase in savings by China over the past 10 years was primarily due to high profits in the corporate sector .
Chinese growth now seems likely to slow sharply , and this will likely reduce savings and the current account .
China still does have long - standing scope for a fiscal stimulus .
But the Chinese economy is only about 6 % of world GDP and their effective additional stimulus per year is likely to be around 3 % of GDP .
3 % of 6 % is essentially a rounding error in the world ’s economy , and will have little noticeable effect globally – although it might just keep oil prices higher than they would be otherwise .
India
There are striking similarities between the current policy debate in India and in the Eurozone .
In both places , there is little or no concern that inflation will rebound any time soon .
At least for people based in Delhi , there is as a result confidence that aggressive monetary policy can cushion the blows coming from the global economy .
As in the Eurozone , all eyes are on monetary policy because of fears that fiscal policy cannot do much more than it is already doing , given that government debt levels are already on the high side .
The discordant note comes from the business community .
They feel that Delhi does not fully understand that the real economy is already in bad shape .
Sectors such as real estate and autos are hurting badly .
Small businesses , in particular , are bearing the brunt of the blow .
The banking picture seems more murky , but is surely not good .
And of course the Satyam accounting scandal could not come at a worse time .
Overall , official growth forecasts need to be marked down for India , although the monsoon was good and the agricultural sector is not highly leveraged .
India will likely cut interest rates further quite soon ( and has space for additional cuts ) , but we should not expect much more from the fiscal side .
Other emerging markets
Pressure on other emerging markets continues to intensify .
East - Central Europe ( including Turkey ) , which spent the last several years borrowing heavily from Western European banks , has been especially hard hit by the contraction of credit as those banks turn to hoarding cash .
The IMF is projecting contraction for both East - Central Europe and Russia ; in the latter case , this is a severe turnaround from estimated growth of 6.2 % in 2008 .
The European Union ’s strategy for East - Central Europe is coming apart at the seams .
Supporting exchange rates at overvalued levels does not make sense and actually adds to adjustment costs .
Consequently , social tension is mounting in Latvia and elsewhere .
The Latvian government is struggling to reduce nominal wages ; this is an almost impossible task anywhere .
The government in Iceland has fallen .
Fresh waves of financial market pressure are likely to move throughout the region , probably triggered by the timing of external debt rollover needs .
Worldwide , many emerging market countries will need to borrow from the IMF .
Some countries will be willing to go early to the IMF , but for most the fear of a potential stigma ( and desire to do well in upcoming elections ) will lead them to prefer fiscal austerity ( and perhaps even contractionary monetary policy ) without IMF involvement .
The IMF will be more engaged in smaller emerging markets , such as in East - Central Europe .
But even if the IMF doubles its loanable resources to $ 500bn ( as recently announced ) , it does n’t have enough funding to make a difference for large emerging markets , whose problems are due to their own policy mix , particularly allowing the private sector to take on large debts in dollars .
We should expect the IMF to lend another $ 100bn over the next six months ( worldwide ) , and the G20 needs to keep talking about providing the Fund with more resources .
Larger emerging markets will not suffer collapse , but will increase ( attempted ) savings and , as a result , will experience slowdowns .
The temptation for competitive devaluation will grow over time .
But emerging markets cannot grow out of the recession through exports unless there is a strong recovery in the US or the Eurozone or both , which is unlikely .
Many emerging markets are particularly hard hit by the fall in commodity prices .
While some commodity prices may have reached their floors , a return to the levels of early 2008 will not happen until significant global growth has resumed , which could take years .
Political risks in China and other emerging markets create further downside risks .
In our baseline , we assume no serious domestic or international disruptions in this regard .
Global Policy Implications
One leading anti-recession idea for the moment is a global fiscal stimulus amounting to 2 % of the planet ’s GDP .
The precise math behind this calculation is still forthcoming , but it obviously assumes a big stimulus in the US and also needs to include a pretty big fiscal expansion in Europe .
( Emerging markets will barely be able to make a contribution that registers on the global scale . )
This global policy strategy is already running out of steam .
Very few countries now find room for a fiscal stimulus ; debt levels are too high and fiscal capacity is hard pressed by contingent liabilities in the banking system – particularly with an increasing probability of quasi-nationalization .
As a result , the idea of a 2 % of GDP global fiscal stimulus seems quite far - fetched at this point .
Further monetary easing is therefore in the cards , especially as fears of deflation take hold , both for developed countries and emerging markets .
There may now be some catching up by central banks – in that regard , see the latest Turkish move as a foreshadowing .
Commodity prices will likely decline further as the global economic situation turns out to be worst than current consensus forecasts .
As a result , official growth forecasts for most low income countries seem far too high .
The worldwide reduction in credit continues , largely driven by lower demand for credit as households and firms try to strengthen their balance sheets by saving rather than spending .
The crisis and associated slowdown started in the US , but the recession is now global .
The US economy is no more than 1/4 of the world economy , so even the largest US fiscal stimulus – say 3 % of U.S. GDP per annum – cannot be not large enough to significantly raise the world ’s growth rate at this stage .
If we stabilize our financial system fully and restore consumer credit , this will help .
But remember that we are subject to shocks from outside and the outlook there is worse than in the US in many ways .
Outside the US the tasks look much harder .
One key principle , stated repeatedly by both the G20 and the IMF , is that policy responses need to be coordinated .
This is a basic lesson of the Great Depression , when protectionist trade policies reduced exports across the board without benefiting any nation .
The current crisis has not seen a widespread outbreak of higher trade barriers – although some of the bailout programs national governments have offered to domestic industries could amount to protectionist subsidies .
Instead , however , we are seeing friction over currency valuations , as countries ( who can afford to ) try to boost their exports .
In terms of recent developments , Switzerland threatened to intervene on foreign exchange markets to suppress the value of the Swiss franc .
And the French finance minister criticized the U.K. for letting the pound depreciate .
In addition , fiscal constraints give national governments an incentive to reduce the size of their stimulus packages and attempt to free - ride off of other countries instead .
Many countries are probably looking to the United States and hoping that our reasonably large stimulus – 6 % of GDP , spread roughly over two years – will help turn around the global economy as a whole .
Looking Forward
The first order of business is clearly to revive the US and global economies .
However , it is also imperative that we understand the nature of the global economic order that we live in , with the goal of minimizing the chances of a similar economic crisis in the future and reducing the severity of such a crisis should it occur .
As mentioned above , while the government balance sheet can absorb the cost of restoring the economy this time , it is not clear how many times we can add 20 % of GDP to the national debt .
We also need to recognize that financial crises , just like bubbles , will recur .
Government regulators , no matter how motivated and skilled , are no match for the collective ingenuity of billions of human beings doing things that no regulator envisioned .
The only real way to protect a national economy in the face of systemic financial problems is with a sufficiently strong government balance sheet ( i.e. , low debt relative to the government ’s ability to raise taxes ) .
This requires counter - cyclical fiscal policy during a boom , which is always politically difficult .
However , this implies less room for fiscal stimulus now , or alternatively the need to put in place measures that will compensate for the stimulus once the economy has recovered .
In order to create the conditions for long - term economic health , we need to identify the real structural problem that created the current situation .
The underlying problem was that , after the 1980s , the “ Great Moderation ” of volatility in industrialized countries created the conditions under which finance became larger relative to GDP and credit could grow rapidly in any boom .
In addition , globalization allowed banks to become big relative to the countries in which they are based ( with Iceland as an extreme example ) .
Financial development , while often beneficial , brings risks as well .
The global economic growth of the last several years was in reality a global , debt - financed boom , with self - fulfilling characteristics – i.e. , it could have gone on for many years or it could have collapsed earlier .
The US housing bubble was inflated by global capital flows , but bubbles can occur in a closed economy .
The European financial bubble , including massive lending to Eastern Europe and Latin America , occurred with zero net capital flows ( the Eurozone had a current account roughly in balance ) .
China ’s export - driven manufacturing sector had a bubble of its own , in its case with net capital outflow ( a current account surplus ) .
But these regional bubbles were amplified and connected by a global financial system that allowed capital to flow easily around the world .
Ordinarily , by delivering capital to the places where it is most useful , global capital flows promote economic growth , in particular in the developing world .
But the global system also allows bubbles to feed on money raised from anywhere in the world , exacerbating systemic risks .
When billions of dollars are flowing from the richest countries in the world to Iceland , a country of 320,000 people , chasing high rates of interest , the risks of a downturn are magnified , for the people of Iceland in particular .
Ideally , global economic growth requires a rebalancing away from the financial sector and toward non-financial industries such as manufacturing , retail , and health care ( for an expansion of this argument , see this op - ed ) .
Especially in advanced economies such as the US and the UK , the financial sector has accounted for an unsustainable share of corporate profits and profit growth .
The only solution is to invest in the basic ingredients of productivity growth – education , infrastructure , research and development , sound regulatory policy , and so on – so that our economy can develop new engines of growth .
But this change in the allocation of resources is greatly complicated by the increased political power of the financial lobby .
During the boom years , large banks and their fellow travelers accumulated ever greater political power .
This power is now being used to channel government subsidies into the now outmoded ( and actually dangerous ) financial structure , and in essence to prevent resources from moving out of finance into technology and manufacturing across the industrialized world .
We have done considerable damage to our economies through a debt - fueled bubble .
But it could get worse .
If the financial sector can use its political power to generate a higher level of subsidies from the government , we will convert even more of our banking industry into pure rent - seeking activities ( i.e. , all the bankers will do is lobby , successfully , for more support in various forms ) .
If public policy is captured by banks in the US , Europe and elsewhere , then we face much slower productivity and overall growth rates for the next 20 years .

Photographer Gary Wheeler captured a remarkable series of images telling the story of a pair of Bald Eagles fighting over one clever duck .
In his own words :
I was walking along the shore of Lake Tapps on Monday , and noticed a big commotion a little more than 1/4 - mile away ( as measured later by Google Earth ) .
I saw a Bald Eagle circling and repeatedly diving on what I thought must be a school of fish .
Soon he was joined by another Eagle and they began to fight each other for the prey .
Territorial Eagle fights do happen , but I ’ve never seen one , nor have I seen any good photos …

It is never reassuring to hear that a man who calls himself Count Grishnackh is to be released from prison .
And yet that is what is happening to the Norwegian black - metal icon Varg Vikernes , who murdered Mayhem 's guitarist and set three churches on fire .
It was just 16 years ago that Vikernes was sitting in an Oslo court , smiling as he received a maximum sentence .
Best known as the leader of Burzum – whose first album begins with a song called Feeble Screams from Forests Unknown – Vikernes was also a far - right political activist and , er , grim dude .
Though he was refused four times for parole – most recently in September 2008 – Vikernes is now set to walk free , he told Daglabet magazine .
" I 'm ready for society — and I have been for many years , " Vikernes emphasised in an interview last July .
" I have learned from my mistakes and become older .
Now I just want to be together with my family ...
I have barely seen my son since he came into the world .
Even though I hear his voice on the phone almost every day , it is very tough to not be present while he is growing up . "
For the past couple of years , Vikernes has been allowed to leave the prison and make visits to his family , according to Blabbermouth .
His mother , wife , 18 - month - old son and 16 - year - old daughter all live in Tromsø near the prison .
" I look forward the day that I [ can ] work on my farm , create music , write books and be with the wife and kids around the clock — and live a normal life , " he said .
Though Vikernes will no longer be bound by prison schedules , he will have to regularly report to a parole officer , intially for every two weeks and then once a month .
Count Grishnackh plans to move to a small farm near
Bø and says he no longer has any ties with far - right Norwegian groups .
" My mind has never been in prison , " he said .
" I think all the time about what I should do on the day that I am released . "
May we suggest that he cuddle some kittens ?
Dr. John Dee , the Necronomicon & the Cleansing of the World -
A Gnostic Trail
© Colin Low 1996 , revised 2000
The Necronomicon is the rarest and most terrible of the magical grimoires .
According to New England horror writer Howard Philip Lovecraft , the Necronomicon was
" Composed by Abdul Al - Hazred , a mad poet of Sanaa , in Yemen , who is said to have flourished during the period of the Ommiade caliphs , circa 700 A.D.
He visited the ruins of Babylon and the subterranean secrets of Memphis and spent ten years alone in the great southern desert of Arabia - the Roba al Khaliyeh , or " Empty Space " of the ancients and " Dahma " or " Crimson " desert of the modern Arabs , which is held to be inhabited by protective evil spirits and monsters of death .
Of this desert many strange and unbelievable marvels are told by those who pretend to have penetrated it .
In his last years , Al - Hazred dwelt in Damascus , where the Necronomicon ( Al Azif ) was written , and of his final death or disappearance ( 738 A.D. ) many terrible and conflicting things are told . "
( Lovecraft )
In his history of the Necronomicon , Lovecraft adds that it was translated into English by Dr. John Dee .
This manuscript was never published and survives only in rare and often incomplete copies .
The fabulous Necronomicon ( in freehand copies of the vernacular Dee translation ) features in a number of Lovecrafts better tales , such as The Dunwich Horror .
Despite many attempts to show that the Necronomicon is nothing more than Lovecrafts literary invention , a group of prominent authors and occultists claimed to provide confirmation of part of Lovecrafts claim .
In 1978 a book researched by David Langford and Robert Turner claimed that Alhazreds Necronomicon had been preserved by Alkindi in his treatise The Book of the Essence of the Soul .
In his introduction to Turner and Langfords book , Colin Wilson , the occult writer and author of the classic study of intellectual alienation The Outsider , details Lovecrafts family history .
He notes that Dr. Stanislaus Hinterstoisser , president of the Salzburg Institute for the Study of Magic and Occult Phenomena , claimed that Lovecraft 's father was an Egyptian Freemason and that Lovecrafts father had had access to the Necronomicon .
( In point of fact , Lovecrafts father was a travelling salesman who died a siphilitic while Lovecraft was young , and is almost certainly being confused with Lovecrafts bibliophile maternal grandfather ) .
Co-author Robert Turner , after extensive work on John Dees manuscripts held in the Bristish Museum , showed that Alkindis lost work had been preserved by John Dee in an enciphered form called the Liber Logaeth .
This is not an implausible suggestion .
Dee was a passionate collector of books , and owned one of the largest libraries in Europe .
He was familiar with ciphers and travelled widely on the continent of Europe , to the extent that at least one biographer has suggested he was a 16th .
century James Bond acting on behalf of Queen Elizabeth I and her ministers .
It is known that one of the foremost works on occultism and encipherment of the period , the Steganographia of the Abbot Trithemius , was copied by Dee in longhand over a period of days in an intense burst of activity .
An engraved portrait of Edward Kelly , Dees partner and scryer in the angelic revelations , is shown holding a open volume with the name " Trithemius " on the page .
The Liber Logaeth does exist ( Sloane 3189 ???? ) , and is a combination of an incomprehensible angelic language ( which Kelly understood only while in trance ) and a series of letters composed into a series of 49 by 49 squares .
As if this was not enough , another mysterious cipher manuscript has also been connected with Dee , the baffling Voynich manuscript .
Despite many attempts to decipher this manuscript , it still remains unbroken .
This enigmatic text has also been linked with Lovecrafts Necronomicon .
On the basis of its diagrams all we know is that it might be a herbal .
It could be a cipher manuscript that Dee records as having purchased in Prague .
All else is conjecture .
The claim that Lovecrafts relatives were Masonic initiates is not substantiated by what we know of his family .
An alternative explanation ( promoted by the author in an extended moment of wickedness ) , that Lovecrafts wife Sonia Greene associated with the notorious occultist and poet Aleister Crowley during his residence in New York in 1918 is completely plausible and consistent with both their characters , but entirely untrue .
One of the participants in the Langford - Turner spoof ( Colin Wilson ) has admitted in print that it is a spoof .
It is a good spoof however .
The best spoofs work because they are founded on truth , and the untruths are so deeply embedded one needs be an expert to winkle them out .
It was a technique H. P. Lovecraft understood well , and he used it extensively to add versimilitude to his fiction .
Dr. John
Dee is a pivotal figure in renaissance theurgical magic , and the system he developed not only survives to this day , it is one of the most active areas of modern magic .
Using Dee as a link in the history of the Necronomicon was an inspired move by Lovecraft .
There is a second connection between Dee and Lovecraft 's mythos , and it is much more subtle - and in some ways more bizarre - than any spoof .
This second link between Dee and the Necronomicon has grown out of a 20th .
century , quasi- gnostic myth surrounding the entity Chrononzon ( using Aleister Crowleys spelling ) .
Choronzon is a demonic entity that occurs in the transcript of a lost book that John Dee received through the mediumship of a scryer called Edward Kelley , from non-human entities who claimed to be angels .
Fragments from this book , The Book of Enoch , are scattered throughout his angelic conversations and recorded in Dee 's diaries of the angelic communications .
Choronzon is mentioned only once in John Dees diaries , during a communication from the angels concerning the expulsion of Adam from the garden of Eden :
" But Coronzon ( for so is the name of that mighty devil ) , envying mans felicity , and perceiving that the substance of mans lesser part was frail and unperfect in respect to his purer essence , began to assail man and so prevailed .
By offending so , man became accursed in the sight of God , and so lost both the garden of Felicity and the judgement of his understanding , but not utterly the favour of God .
But he was driven forth ( as your scriptures record ) unto the earth which was covered with brambles .
...
But in the same instant when Adam was expelled , the Lord gave unto the world her time , and placed over her Angelic Keepers , Watchmen and Princes . " ( James p.1 )
In this context C( h ) oronzon is identical with the Serpent of Genesis , and with the rebellious angel Samael in Jewish midrashic and kabbalistic legend .
We can equate Choronzon with the Devil , but I must emphasise this is not the Devil of Christian myth ; this is the Devil from myths that predate Christianity .
In one of the earliest kabbalistic works , The Bahir , it is Samael that rebels against God and tempts Adam through the agency of the serpent :
" [ Samael ] said :  How can we cause him to sin and be exiled from before God . 
He descended with all his host , and sought a suitable companion on Earth .
He finally found the serpent , which looked like a camel , and he rode on it . " ( Bahir p.81 )
After tempting Eve
" [ God ] took the three of them , and decreed upon them a sentence of nine curses and death .
He then cast the wicked Samael and his group from their holy place in heaven .
He cut off the feet of the serpent and cursed it more than all the other animals and beasts of the field .
He also decreed that it must shed its skin every seven years .
Samael was punished and made the guardian angel over the wicked Esau . " ( Bahir p.82 )
Dee 's record states ( see above ) that " the Lord gave unto the world her time , and placed over her Angelic Keepers , Watchmen and Princes " There is a confusion over the identity of the  Angelic Keepers mentioned in Dees record above .
That the earth is watched over by angels is a very old tradition , and it is fascinating to see it surface during Dees angelic communications .
According to Dees angels , the Watchmen and Watchtowers are provided
" against the usurping blasphemy , misuse and stealth of the wicked and great enemy , the Devil .
To the intent that being put to the Earth , his envious will might be bridled ... " ( T& FR p.170 )
The story appears to be straighforward according both to Dees angels and traditional legend : Samael / Choronzon tempted Eve , and was banished into the world with them , and Watchers were set over the creation to maintain its bounds .
However , traditional legend holds a surprise :
" Samael and his angels were banished to a dark dungeon , where they still languish , their faces haggard , their lips sealed ; and are now known as the Watchers " ( Graves & Patai )
This legend is recounted in a book that Dee could not have read because it was lost in Europe until it was brought back from Ethiopia by the Scots adventurer James Bruce of Kinnaird in 1773 .
By an astonishing coincidence this happens to be yet another Book of Enoch .
Although it has been dubbed one of the most boring books ever written , anyone with an interest in Dee and Kellys conversations with angels should read it .
Too much attention has been devoted to the magical system communicated by the angels to Dee ; this occupies a relatively small part of the several hundred pages in Dees transcripts .
The angels have a great deal to say .
It is interesting to meet again many of Dees angels in the visions recounted in the Ethiopian Book of Enoch .
It is interesting to compare their concerns .
Much of the content of the Ethiopian book is about the background to the first destruction of the world , an event brought about by the evil caused by angelic " Watchers " ( Patai suggests an alternative translation " guardian angels " - that is , they are identical with Dees Watchmen and Overseers ) .
Much of the content of Dees transcript is concerned with the final destruction of the world .
This theme occurs constantly , both explicitly and through symbolism which is clearly linked to the Apocalypse or Revelation of St. John .
Dee was well aware of this , and his margin notes show that he understood the references .
Dee divided the world into three ages : the first age up to the Flood , a second age up to the coming of Jesus Christ , and a final age terminated by the destruction of the world .
In common with many ( most ) Europeans of his time , he lived his life in an awareness that this end was not a conjecture - it was a matter of fact - and that it was imminent .
The angels confirm several times that the " end of days " is nigh .
There are so many parallels between events leading up to the first destruction of the world ( the biblical Flood ) and events leading up to the final destruction ( the Apocalypse ) that they must be considered duals - that is , not as unconnected mythic material , but as the beginning and end of the same story reflected like mirror images at opposite ends of time .
The three ages of the world are in some way connected to the three mystical and visionary works that tell the story : the Ethiopian Book of Enoch , Dees Book of Enoch , and the Apocalypse of St. John .
The legend of the Watchers in the Ethiopian Book of Enoch , a book neither Dee or Kelly could have read , is that the angels set to watch over the creation lusted after the daughters of men and came down to earth .
Their name in Hebrew , the Nephilim , means literally " The Fallen Ones " .
The part - human offspring of these unions were terrible and evil " giants " , and Jewish commentaries on the scriptures ( midrash ) make it clear that the Flood was a direct consequence of the evil caused on earth by the fall of the angels ( this is not entirely clear in the Bible itself , but commentaries are very clear about the causality ) .
In his visions , the seer of the Book of Enoch is taken by the angel Uriel to a deep abyss ...
" ... with columns of heavenly fire , and among them I saw columns of fire fall , which were beyond measure alike towards the height and towards the depth .
And beyond that abyss I saw a place which had no firmament of the heaven above , and no firmly bounded earth beneath it : there was no water upon it , and no birds , but it was a waste and horrible place .
I saw there seven stars like great burning mountains , and to me , when I inquired regarding them , The angel said  This place is the end of heaven and earth : this has become a prison for the stars and the hosts of heaven ....
And Uriel said to me  Here shall stand the angels who have connected themselves with women , and their spirits , assuming many different forms , are defiling mankind and shall lead them astry into sacrificing to demons as gods , ( here they shall stand ) , till the day of the great judgement in which they shall be judged till they are made an end of . " ( Enoch )
It is estimated that the earliest parts of this work date from 200 - 150 BC , hundreds of years before any part of the New Testament was written .
The continuity between the fall of the angels , the first destruction of the world , their imprisonment , and the final judgement and end is explicit here and in other passages :
" From the days of the slaughter and destruction and death of the giants , from the souls of whose flesh the spirits , having gone forth , shall destroy without incurring judgement - thus shall they destroy until the day of the consummation , the great judgement in which the age shall be consummated over the Watchers and the godless , yea shall be wholly consumated . "
( Enoch )
There is a strong probability that the seven stars " burning like great mountains " are identical with the seven evil demons of Assyrio - Babylonian sorcery :
" Destructive storms ( and ) evil winds are they ,
An evil blast that heraldeth the baneful storm ,
An evil blast , forerunner of the baneful storm ,
They are mighty children , mighty sons ,
Heralds of the Pestilence ,
Throne - bearers of Ninkigal ,
They are the flood which rushesth through the land .
Seven gods of the broad heaven ,
Seven gods of the broad earth ,
Seven robber gods are they .
Seven gods of might ,
Seven evil gods ,
Seven evil demons ,
Seven evil demons of oppression ,
Seven in heaven and seven on earth . "
( D& ESoB )
There are many incantations and exorcisms against the terrible seven :
" Spirits that minish the land ,
Of giant strength ,
Of giant strength and giant tread ,
Demons ( like ) raging bulls , great ghosts ,
Ghosts that break through all houses ,
Demons that have no shame ,
Seven are they !
Knowing no care ,
They grind the land like corn ;
Knowing no mercy ,
They rage against mankind ;
They spill their blood like rain
Devouring their flesh ( and ) sucking their veins ,
Where the images of the gods are , there they quake ( ? )
In the Temple of Nabu , who fertilizeth the shoots of wheat .
They are demons full of violence ,
Ceaselessly devouring blood . "
( D&ESoB )
The evil giant offspring of the Nephilim in Jewish legend were also noted for their vaste appetites , eating thousands of animals a day , and even human flesh ( obviously a memory of large sacrificial offerings ) .
The " seven evil sons of Ea " described on ancient clay tablets are enumerated as the South Wind , a dragon with mouth agape , a grim leopard that carries off young , a terrible serpent , a furious beast , an evil windstorm and one that cannot be identified because of damage to the clay tablet .
It is possible that these seven evil sons of Ea reappear in the Apocalypse , firstly as the seven angels with seven trumpets whose sounding progressively causes terrible events to occur that mark the end of the world , and also the " seven angels with seven plagues " carrying bowls containing the wrath of God .
It is highly likely that the ninth Enochian key ( from Dee 's angelic transcript ) evokes the same terrible seven :
" A mighty garde of fire with two - edged swords flaming ( which have viols of wrath for two tymes and a half : whose wings are of wormwood and of the marrow of salt ) , have setled their feete in the West , and are measured with their Ministers 9996 .
These gather up the moss of the earth as a rich man doth his threasor : cursed ar they whose iniquities they are in their eyes are milstones greater than the earth
And from their mowthes rune seas of blud :
Their heds are covered with diamond : and upon their heds are marble sleves .
Happy is he , on whom they frown not .
For why ?
The God of righteousness reioyceth in them .
Come away and not your Viols ... " ( James )
Definitely a case of " Dont bring a bottle " - see Revelations XV for a more explicit description of what these angels can bring to a party , hence the exhortation to " Come away and not your viols " ( vials ) .
It can be seen that one slight reference to Chronozon in Dees transcript of his conversations with angels hides a rich and somewhat muddled lore .
That Choronzon is identical with Samael is evident .
The lore concerning Samael is somewhat confusing however .
He tempted Adam and was cast out of heaven to earth .
He was assigned to watch over the earth , but fell ( with his angels ) and begat monsters , culminating in the first destruction of mankind .
He is chief of the evil seven ( seven imprisoned stars in Enoch , seven Assyrio - Babylonian demons , seven deadly angels ) that God keeps at hand for running the more unpleasant parts of the eschatological process .
He will be judged at the end of time .
He will be unleashed at the end of time .
This apocalyptic theme is strongly pronounced in the work of both H.P. Lovecraft and the 20th .
century magician Aleister Crowley .
Crowley had a fundamentalist Christian upbringing , and incorporated many elements from the book of Revelations into his personal myth .
He reinterpreted the symbols to suit himself , but there is no question that like Dee , he had a deep and scholarly knowledge of the book .
It is often forgotten just how thorough Crowleys knowledge of the Bible was - he could quote Biblical passages with the best .
The axis around which Crowleys life turned was the communication of " The Book of the Law " in Cairo " on three successive days , April 8th. , 9th. , and 10th. , in the year 1904 " .
Crowley continues :
" The author called himself Aiwass , and claimed to be  the minister of Hoor - Paar - Kraat ; that is , a messenger from the forces ruling the earth at present ... " ( Crowley , LavL )
The idea that there are forces ruling the earth is a little odd to the modern mind , but it is consistent with very old traditions that the earth is watched over by a hierarchy of powers , and can be traced back to the earliest times when the stars and planets were worshiped literally as the divine rulers of the world ( the Sumerian cuniform for a god is a star symbol ) .
That Crowley was not a million miles from this viewpoint can be seen in his own explanation of " The new Aeon " : " It explains that certain vast stars ( or aggregates of experience ) may be described as Gods .
One of these is in charge of the destinies of this planet for periods of 2000 years " .
Just in case you assume Crowley was talking purely metaphorically ( he was a complex man and routinely talked on several levels at once ... ) one should consider that the 2000 year period mentioned by Crowley refers to the movement of the intersection of the Earths equatorial plane with the ecliptic ( the first point in Aries ) through a sign of the Zodiac , a movement caused by the Earths axial precession .
In other words , Crowley is referring to a zodiacal sign as being " in charge " of the planet .
He is referring to the onset of what is more routinely referred to as " The Age of Aquarius " .
Crowley understood the Book of the Law to be the corporate mission statement of the new planetary management , delivered by the trinity of Nuit , Hadit and Ra-Hoor - Kuit with himself as mouthpiece and prophet .
It has an apocalyptic flavour , firstly because it literally marks the end of one age and the beginning of a new age , and secondly because this new age has something in common with the terrible " end- time " of Revelations .
Crowleys personal identification with the Great Beast of Revelation has deep roots in his desire to usher in the destruction of the stifling world of his childhood .
Crowley admits that many people will find some parts of this small book " repugnant " .
It is tempting to read many passages mystically , magically or metaphorically to blunt the harshness of the message .
These are some extracts from the words of Hadit :
20 .
Beauty and strength , leaping laughter and delicious languor , force and fire are of us .
21 .
We have nothing with the outcast and the unfit ; let them die in their misery .
For they feel not .
Compassion is the vice of kings : stamp down the wretched and the weak : this is the law of the strong : this is our law and the joy of the world .
Think not , o king , upon that lie : That Thou Must Die : verily thou shalt not die , but live .
Now let it be understood :
If the body of the King dissolve , he shall remain in pure ecstacy for ever .
22 I am the Snake that giveth Knowledge and Delight and bright glory , and stir the hearts of men with drunkenness .
To worship me take wine and strange drugs whereof I will tell my prophet & be drunk thereof .
They shall not harm ye at all .
It is a lie this folly against self .
The exposure of innocence is a lie .
Be strong o man !
lust , enjoy all things of sense and rapture : fear not that any God shall deny thee for this .
( Crowley , LavL )
And some extracts from the words of Ra Hoor Kuit :
11 . .... Worship me with fire and blood ; worship me with swords & with spears .
Let the woman be girt with a sword before me : let blood flow to my name .
Trample down the Heathen ; be upon them o warrior , I will give you of their flesh to eat !
46 . I am the warrior Lord of the Forties : the Eighties cower before me and are abased .
I will bring you to victory and joy : I will be at your arms in battle & ye shall delight to slay .
( Crowley , LavL )
If one is to offer an apology for this , then the best that one can do is observe that gods and goddesses tend to be made in the image of their worshippers , and the gods of the ancient world were almost incomprehensibly different from anything now regarded as acceptable in western culture .
It is difficult to find a modern historian who will say anything pleasant about the Assyrians , a people who delighted in warfare , butchery , and torture .
There is a shocked unanimity among Assyrian scholars ; a numbness at having to translate too many commemorative inscriptions recalling their brutal successes in war , plunder , siege and sack .
The words of Hadit and Ra Hoor Kuit have an unpleasant authenticity .
It is interesting to compare the general tone of The Book of the Law with the following passage from one of Lovecrafts most influential stories , The Call of Cthulhu .
" That cult would never die until the stars came right again [ precession of the Equinoxes ? - CL ] , and the secret priests would take Cthulhu from His tomb to revive His subjects and resume
His rule of earth .
The time would be easy to know , for then mankind would have become as the Great Old Ones ; free and wild , and beyond good and evil , with laws and morals thrown aside and all men shouting and killing and revelling in joy .
Then the liberated Old Ones would teach them new ways to shout and kill and revel and enjoy themselves , and all earth would flame with a holocaust of ecstacy and freedom . "
( Lovecraft , CoC )
Many of Lovecrafts stories ( the so - called Cthulhu Mythos ) are based on the premise that at one time in the distant past , various races of beings came to the Earth from the stars .
These beings were cast out or imprisoned , but await the moment when they can return to reclaim the Earth for themselves .
They are neither material or immaterial , partaking of both qualities , and in their exile they are confined not in some far away place , but in dimensions of reality adjacent to our own .
They are continually seeking ways to return , and the danger of texts such as the Necronomicon is that they could tempt an unwary magician into opening the Gate between their dimension and our own .
The return of the Old Ones is apocalyptic because it effectively terminates humanitys short dominion on this planet - it is the end of our world .
There is a substantial identity between the conditions required for the return of the Old Ones ( outlined in the passage above ) and the general conditions mediated by Crowleys New Aeon .
It is worth adding that although Lovecraft and Crowley were contemporaries , there is no evidence that either knew of the others existence .
In another of those strange coincidences that give the impression that there is more going on than meets the eye , Choronzon reappears ( literally ) in the North African desert .
The event is recorded in Crowleys autobiography , and also in a record of his progress through the thirty Enochian Aethyrs , a book he published as The Vision and the Voice in 1911 in Volume 1 , No.5 of The Equinox .
Like a subterranean river , the system of magic given to John Dee by the angels had not disappeared into obscurity .
It " quit the night and sought the day " almost exactly 300 years after its original revealing ( Dees scrying transcripts with Kelly terminated in 1587 , and the Golden Dawn was instituted in 1887 ) , becoming an integral and core part of the magical syllabus taught by the now famous Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn .
Crowley joined the Order in 1898 and played a role in its disintegration two years later .
He also published much of the Orders magical syllabus in his periodical The Equinox .
It was from the Golden Dawn that Crowley acquired his initial knowledge of Dees angelic magic , but in his autobiography he says that he followed that up by visiting the Bodleian library in Oxford to study Dees original manuscripts , in preparation for publishing the Enochian system in The Equinox - he did in fact publish a substantial summary of Dees system ( including much that is not found in the Golden Dawn Knowledge lectures ) in 1912 in Vol. 1 No.7 of The Equinox .
He says he spent " much time and research " clarifying the obscurities of the Enochian system with Frater Semper Paratus ( Thomas Windram ) , an Adeptus Major of the Golden Dawn .
In other words , we must regard Crowley as an independently motivated student of the angelic system , who continued to study and use the system for a decade after he parted company with the Golden Dawn .
Crowley invoked the angels of the first two Aethyrs while travelling and climbing in Mexico in August 1900 .
He did not feel ready ( or able ) to go further for nine more years .
He says he had " no special object " in going to Algiers with his magical protogee , the poet Victor Neuburg ( who is better known through his friendship with Dylan Thomas ) .
Nevertheless , he just happened to discover ( nestling in a crevice at the bottom of his rucksack in amongst the fluff and kif and biscuit crumbs ) one of his magical notebooks containing the Enochian keys , and also his " great golden topaz ( set in a cavalry cross of six squares , made of wood , painted vermillion ) , engraved with a Greek cross of five squares charged with the Rose of forty - nine petals " .
Well , I find that sort of thing in my rucksack all the time .
I even lost my ritual double - handed broadsword once , and had to go through all the pockets before I found it .
The invocations were carried out as they walked across the desert towards Bou Saada , usually one invocation per day , and the entire series took most of a month .
As the Aethyrs progressed in difficulty Crowley began to recite a passage from the Koran 1001 times each day , prostrating himself on the ground with each repetition .
During each invocation Neuburg acted as scribe , and Crowley appears to have recited the Call of the Thirty Aethyrs and then pressed the shewstone against his forehead - he mentions on several occasions the extreme pain this caused .
The " vision and the voice " which were obtained in trance following the Call lasted between 1.5 and 3 hours .
Crowley assigned Dees thirty Aethyrs to the ten sephiroth of the Kabbalah in what is know as " lightning flash " order , beginning in Malkuth with 30 ( TEX ) , 29 ( RII ) and 28 ( BAG ) .
In the system of the Golden Dawn , the magician was initiated through the sephiroth in this " lightning flash " order until the sephira Chesed was reached , at which point the Abyss was encountered , an abyss which separates the microcosm of the magician from the macrocosmic realm of the three supernal sephiroth , which represent ( along with Malkuth ) the manifest God .
According to Crowleys assignment of the Aethyrs , the tenth Aethyr marks the abyss , and it is this aethyr which Crowley calls " accursed " .
It was during the invocation of this Aethyr that the encounter with Choronzon occured .
Crowley received a warning of this encounter during the fifteenth Aethyr :
And even as the shew - stone burneth thy forehead with its intolerable flame , so he who hath known me , though but from afar , is marked out and chosen among men , and he shall never turn back or turn aside , for he hath made the link that is not to be broken , nay , not by the malice of the Four Great Princes of evil of the world , nor by Chorozon , that mighty Devil , nor by the wrath of God , nor by the affliction and feebleness of the soul .
The full " terror of the situation " became apparent to Crowley during the eleventh Aethyr ; the encounter with Choronzon in the Abyss would have to be experienced .
Crowley asked the Angel of the eleventh Aethyr whether anyone would be appointed warden during this encounter , and received as answer " Eloi Eloi lama sabacthani " - the words of Christ in his final despair and agony .
The vision of the eleventh Aethyr continued :
" And he speaketh unto me these words : Behold , a mighty guard against the terror of things , the fastness of the Most High , the legions of eternal vigilance ; these are they that keep watch and ward day and night throughout the aeons .
Set in them is all force of the Mighty One , yet there stirreth not one plume of the wings of their helmets .
Behold , the foundation of the Holy City , the towers and the bastions thereof !
Behold the armies of light that are set against the outermost Abyss , against the horror of emptiness , and the malice of Choronzon .
These things are spoken unto him that understandeth , that is a breastplate unto the elephants , or a corselet unto the angels , or a scale upon the towers of iron ; yet is this mighty host set only for a defense , and whoso passeth beyond their lines hath no help in them .
Yet must he that understandeth go forth unto the outermost Abyss , and there must he speak with him that is set above the four - fold terror , the Princes of Evil , even with Choronzon , the mighty devil that inhabiteth the outermost Abyss .
And none may speak with him , or understand him , but the servants of Babylon , that understand , and they that are without understanding , his servants .
Behold !
it entereth not into the heart , nor into the mind of man to conceive this matter ; for the sickness of the body is death , and the sickness of the heart is despair , and the sickness of the mind is madness .
But in the outermost Abyss is sickness of the aspiration , and sickness of the will , and sickness of the essence of all , and there is neither word nor thought wherein the image of its image is reflected .
And whoso passeth into the outermost Abyss , except he be of them that understand , holdeth out his hands , and boweth his neck , unto the chains of Choronzon .
And as a devil he walketh about the earth , immortal , and he blasteth the flowers of the earth , and he corrupteth the fresh air , and he maketh poisonous the water ; and the fire that is the friend of man , and the pledge of his aspiration , seeing that it mounteth ever upward as a pyramid , and seeing that man stole it in a hollow tube from Heaven , even that fire he turneth unto ruin , and madness , and fever , and destruction .
And thou , that art an heap of dry dust in the city of the pyramids , must understand these things . "
Like Dees Watchtowers , the walls and towers of the Holy City are fortified by the legions of the Most High against the powers of the Abyss , but they look outwards , not inwards .
There is a spectacular twist in this however , and it is worth examining the transcript of the tenth Aethyr in detail for the light it throws on the true nature of Choronzon .
Note in the last paragraph the poisonous , corrupting and destructive nature of Chronozon .
For the invocation of the tenth Aethyr Crowley and Neuburg retreated far into the dunes , made a triangle of evocation in the sand for the demon to manifest into , and poured the blood of three pigeons at each corner to confine it :
Now , then , the Seer ( Crowley ) being entered within the triangle , let him take the Victims and cut their throats , pouring the blood within the Triangle , and being most heedful that not one drop fall without the Triangle ; or else Choronzon should be able to manifest in the universe .
In his commentary to the electronic edition of the Vision and the Voice , Bill Heidrick remarks " Perhaps the joke here is that the manifest universe is itself , in a sense , Choronzon . "
The accuracy of this remark will become apparent later when the nature of Chrononzon is exposed .
Neuburg ( referred to as " the Scribe " in the transcript ) took his place in the magical circle , while Crowley states that he himself abode apart , in his magical robe with its hood drawn over his face .
I had always assumed that Crowley was present in the triangle of evocation during the working and provided the physical basis for the manifestation of Choronzon - that is , for a time , Crowley was Choronzon .
Crowley implies otherwise , stating he was in a secret place and he neither moved or spoke .
On reflection , this is Crowleyan ambiguity at its worst - I believe he means that as a Master of the Temple his essential nature was across the Abyss in the " City of the Pyramids " , a very secret place indeed , a place characterised by stillness and silence .
Neuburgs record of what happened suggests that the body of Crowley , possessed by Choronzon , was very active indeed .
The " vision and the voice " began :
There is no being in the outermost Abyss , but constant forms come forth from the nothingness of it .
Then the Devil of the Aethyr , that mighty devil Choronzon , crieth aloud , Zazas , Zazas , Nasatanada Zasas .
I am the Master of Form , and from me all forms proceed .
I am I . I have shut myself up from the spendthrifts , my gold is safe in my treasure - chamber , and I have made every living thing my concubine , and none shall touch them , save only I .
And yet I am scorched , even while I shiver in the wind .
He hateth me and tormenteth me .
He would have stolen me from myself , but I shut myself up and mock at him , even while he plagueth me .
From me come leprosy and pox and plague and cancer and cholera and the falling sickness .
Ah !
I will reach up to the knees of the Most High , and tear his phallus with my teeth , and I will bray his testicles in a mortar , and make poison thereof , to slay the sons of men .
Note firstly the demiurgic declaration of Chrononzon : " I am I " .
This demon is the master of form .
Note also that he mutilates the body of God and turns it to poison .
Choronzon hath no form , because he is the maker of all form ; and so rapidly he changeth from one to the other as he may best think fit to seduce those whom he hateth , the servants of the Most High .
Thus taketh he the form of a beautiful woman , or of a wise and holy man , or of a serpent that writheth upon the earth ready to sting .
At this point Neuburg literally saw these many forms of Choronzon , even the form of a woman he loved .
Sometimes Choronzon spoke with Crowleys own voice .
Much of the time the voice of Choronzon was an " insane babble " .
And , because he is himself , therefore he is no self ; the terror of darkness , and the blindness of night , and the deafness of the adder , and the tastelessness of stale and stagnant water , and the black fire of hatred , and the udders of the Cat of slime ; not one thing , but many things .
Yet , with all that , his torment is eternal .
The sun burns him as he writhes naked upon the sands of hell , and the wind cuts him bitterly to the bone , a harsh dry wind , so that he is sore athirst .
Give unto me , I pray thee , one drop of water from the pure springs of Paradise , that I may quench my thirst .
I feed upon the names of the Most High .
I churn them in my jaws , and I void them from my fundament .
I fear not the power of the Pentagram , for I am the Master of the Triangle .
My name is three hundred and thirty and three , and that is thrice one .
Be vigilant , therefore , for I warn thee that I am about to deceive thee .
I shall say words that thou wilt take to be the cry of the Aethyr , and thou wilt write them down , thinking them to be great secrets of Magick power , and they will be only my jesting with thee .
I know the name of the Angel of thee and thy brother P. . . . , and all thy dealings with him are but a cloak for thy filthy sorceries .
( Here the Scribe averred that he knew more than the demon , and so feared him not , and ordered the demon to proceed . )
Thou canst tell me naught that I know not , for in me is all Knowledge : Knowledge is my name .
Is not the head of the great Serpent arisen into Knowledge ?
The great serpent referred to is Leviathon , but more particularly this refers to a Golden Dawn diagram which shows the serpent reaching from the worlds of the evil shells below the Tree of Life up to the place on the Tree called Daath , or Knowledge .
What could Neuburg tell the Maker of Worlds what he does not already know ?
Images , images , images , all without control , all without reason .
The malice of Choronzon is not the malice of a being ; it is the quality of malice , because he that boasteth himself " I am I " , hath in truth no self , and these are they that are fallen under my power , the slaves of the Blind One that boasted himself to be the Enlightened One .
For there is no centre , nay , nothing but Dispersion .
Here Choronzon ( or Crowley ) finally and unequivocally gives the show away .
It was obvious before , but now it is spelled out for us .
Anyone who has read the gnostic gospels recovered from Nag Hammadi will know this demon .
The etymology of the name Samael has two derivations .
The most common and traditional derivation is that it derives from the Hebrew word for poison , and means " Poison of God " .
The identification of Choronzon with Samael was made on the basis of his appearance in Dees transcript as the instrument of the Fall , and in Crowley s vision he is the poisoner and despoiler of the world .
However , the eminent scholar of Jewish mysticism , Gershom Scholem , who made an extensive study of ancient gnostic texts , shows that the oldest and most accurate etymology for Samael is " the blind archon " , and he is identical with the demonic demiurge of the Ophites , Ialdebaoth .
He was also known as " the blind dragon " and identified with Leviathon .
In Mandean gnostism Samael is the demon of blindness .
( Scholem , OotK p.295 for extensive sources ) .
A gnostic text found at Nag Hammadi , The Nature ( Hypostasis ) of the Archons , describes the demiurgic demon creator of the world :
" Their chief is blind [ because of his ] power and ignorance [ and his arrogance ] he said , with his [ power ] , " It is I who am God ; there is none [ apart from me ] . "
When he said this , he sinned against the [ entirety ] .
And this speech got up to incorruptibility ; then there was a voice that came forth from incorruptibility saying " You are mistaken , Samael " - which is , " god of the blind " .
His thoughts became blind .
And having expelled his power - that is , the blasphemy he had spoken - he pursued it down to chaos and the abyss ...
When Crowley / Chronozon mentions the " slaves of the Blind One that boasted himself to be the Enlightened One " , it seems unquestionable that he is referring to the gnostic myth of Samael .
Another gnostic text from the Nag Hammadi corpus , " The Secret Book ( Apocryphon ) of John " states :
" Now the archon who is weak has three names .
The first name is Yaltabaoth , the second is Saklas , and the third is Samael .
And he is impious in his arrogance " .
( TNHG )
Choronzon is the master and the maker of form who has no face because he has all faces ( see above ) .
Another text , quoted by Kurt Rudolph , describes Ialdebaoth as follows :
" But Jaldabaoth , Saklas , the many formed , so that he can show himself with any face , gave to them ( the planets ) of the fire which belongs to him ; but he did not give them of the pure light of the power he had drawn from his mother .
For the reason that he ruled over them , because of the glory which was in him from the power [ of the light ] of his mother .
For this reason he himself called " God " in that he resisted the nature from which he had come into being .
And he bound seven powers with the principalities . "
The mother who brings forth the " abortion " Ialdebaoth is the subject of Crowleys vision of the next ( and ninth ) Aethyr - he calls her " the Virgin of Eternity " , otherwise known in Kabbalah as the sephira Binah .
It is significant that the words Crowley / Choronzon uses are not vague stabs in the general direction of gnostism - they might have been copied directly from gnostic texts .
The Nag Hammadi texts were not discovered until 1945 , two years before Crowleys death , so we cannot accuse him of plagiarism , but ( in the comical extreme ) we can imagine Crowley and Neuburg stumbling across troves of Coptic texts amongst the sand dunes and translating them in situ .
More realistically , Crowley , who was astonishingly erudite , could have found traces of this lore in the works of early Church heresiologists such as Irenaeus of Lyons [ Note : since orginally writing this I have inspected the work of Irenaeus and find nothing that would account for Crowley / Choronzon 's prescience .
Any insight into a source for
" the Blind One that boasted himself to be the Enlightened One "
would be appreciated ]
Less easy to rationalise is what comes next .
When I began to read Dees angelic transcripts I was struck by the thought that the God of Dees angels was the same demonic demiurgic God I was already familiar with in gnostic texts .
It is difficult to give much substance to this feeling , other than to say that the original gnostics derived their demiurge by taking the worst qualities of the God of the Jews , transforming him into a demonic entity .
The God of Dees angels is similarly demonic - a God of wrath and punishments and righteousness  who fully intends ( like the God of Revelation ) to turn the world into a charnel - house .
In his book Tetragrammaton , Donald Tyson points out the phrase " God of Righteousness " quoted in the ninth Enochian key ( quoted earlier ) is given as IAD BALTOH in Enochian , a transparent anagram of IALDBAOTH .
For either of Dee or Kelly to be this ingeniously erudite beggars belief .
Crowleys " vision and voice " continued the manifestation of Choronzon :
Would God that I were dead .
For know that I am proud and revengeful and lascivious , and I prate even as thou .
For even as I walked among the Sons of God , I heard it said that P. .
. could both will and know , and might learn at length to dare , but that to keep silence he should never learn .
O thou that art so ready to speak , so slow to watch , thou art delivered over unto my power for this .
And now one word was necessary unto me , and I could not speak it .
I behold the beauty of the earth in her desolation , and greater far is mine , who sought to be my naked self .
Knowest thou that in my soul is utmost fear ?
And such is my force and my cunning , that a hundred times have I been ready to leap , and for fear have missed .
And a thousand times am I baulked by them of the City of the Pyramids , that set snares for my feet .
More knowledge have I than the Most High , but my will is broken , and my fierceness is marred by fear , and I must speak , speak , speak , millions of mad voices in my brain .
The secret of Choronzon is that Choronzon and and " Most High " are the same .
There is nt a sheet of paper that one could insert between them .
This is the origin of Bill Heidricks comment that there isnt much point in preventing Choronzon from manifesting in the physical universe , because the universe is " in a sense " Choronzon .
The " Most High " is as demonically poisonous and destructive as Choronzon , and declares , like Choronzon , the He is the only God .
Every pulpit thumper is Choronzon , declaring the one truth ; and the pulpit thumpers , thundering at the blasphemies and heresies and sacriligious untruths of other pulpit thumpers are the many faces of Choronzon .
Every person who makes a world for other people to live in is the " Most High " , setting down laws of right and wrong , good and evil , and in their demiurgic isolation they are also Choronzon .
Every aspect of Chronozon , declaring " I am I " in brief isolation from the whole , is the Most High , but taken together ( and there can only be one Most High ) they constitute the raving dispersion of Choronzon .
Choronzon is the particular foe of magicians .
Dee , for example , believed utterly in a Most High who had all knowledge .
A common theme in the Enochian Keys is that the magician commands because he is a " true worshipper of the Highest " .
As a magician approaches the heirophantic position in Chesed , the last sephira before the Abyss , he is assumed to have all the answers .
He is a pope in his own world , with faithful followers who demand mysteries with answers , who demand revelations just as Dee prayed for revelations .
That is why Choronzon scorns Neuburgs claim to know more than he - Choronzon has all the answers anyone could ever want .
A problem with having all the answers is that all the other hierophants also have all the answers , and so the eleventh Aethyr is the Holy City with its mighty walls and towers and motionless legions guarding against the terrible powers of the Abyss , where everything is real , and nothing is true , and the mightiest of hierophants is nothing .
Crowley does not beat around the bush on this issue .
In his own words :
For he is wisdom , and by wisdom hath he made the Worlds , and from that wisdom issue judgements 70 by 4 , that are the 4 eyes of the double - headed one ; that are the 4 devils , Satan , Lucifer , Leviathan , Belial , that are the great princes of the evil of the world .
{ 142 } And Satan is worshipped by men under the name of Jesus ; and Lucifer is worshipped by men under the name of Brahma ; and Leviathan is worshipped by men under the name of Allah ; and Belial is worshipped by men under the name of Buddha .
Poor Neuburg , alone in the protective magical circle , had to contend against all the verbal wiles of the mightiest of devils .
Choronzon began to recite the poem Mad Tom OBedlam
With a heart of furious fancies ,
Whereof I am Commander ,
With a burning spear
And a horse of Air
To the wilderness I wander .
( The idea was to keep the Scribe busy writing , so as to spring upon him .
For , while the Scribe talked , Choronzon had thrown sand into the circle , and filled it up .
But Choronzon could not think fast and continuously , and so resorted to the device of quotation .
The Scribe had written two or three words of " Tom o' Bedlam , " when Choronzon sprang within the circle ( that part of the circumference of which that was nearest to him he had been filling up with sand all this time ) , and leaped upon the Scribe , throwing him to the earth .
The conflict took place within the circle .
The Scribe called upon Tetragrammaton , and succeeded in compelling Choronzon to return into his triangle .
By dint of anger and of threatening him with the Magick Staff did he accomplish this .
He then repaired the circle .
The discomfited demon now continued : )
All is dispersion .
These are the qualities of things .
The tenth Aethyr is the world of adjectives , and there is no substance therein .
I am a -cold .
( Here Choronzon , being a couth and literary demon , ceases being Mad Tom OBedlam and becomes poor Tom of King Lear )
( Here Choronzon wanted to leave the triangle to obtain wherewith to cover his nakedness .
The Scribe refused the request , threatening the demon .
After a while the latter continued : )
I am commanded , why I know not , by him that speaketh .
Were it thou , thou little fool , I would tear thee limb from limb .
I would bite off thine ears and nose before I began with thee .
I would take thy guts for fiddle - strings at the Black Sabbath .
I have prevailed against the Kingdom of the Father , and befouled his beard ; and I have prevailed against the Kingdom of the Son , and torn off his Phallus ; but against the Kingdom of the Holy Ghost shall I strive and not prevail .
The three slain doves are my threefold blasphemy against him ; but their blood shall make fertile the sand , and I writhe in blackness and horror of hate , and prevail not .
At the conclusion Crowley wrote the name BABALON in the sand with his magical ring and he and Neuburg lit a great fire in the sand to purify the place .
This incident in the desert is one of the most memorable incidents in Crowleys vivid and memorable life ; perhaps it is the most memorable .
It has been enormously influential , and an elaborate mythology has accreted around Choronzon and the Abyss .
A key part of this development has been the modern interpretation of the non-sephiroth Daath as a gateway .
Daath means knowledge .
Where the word appears in Genesis it is translated into Greek as gnosis .
When Adam knew Eve , the word used was based on the same verb root as the word Daath .
In traditional Kabbalah Daath never made it as a proper sephiroth ( as Sepher Yetzirah puts it , there could only be " ten and not nine ; ten and not eleven " , and so the eleventh quality on the kabbalistic Tree of Life has developed a mystique that comes from being unlike the others .
As the sephiroth represent emantations of the divine in creation , Daath has progressively taken on the quality of an anti-emanation .
It is difficult to place exactly in time the point at which this attribution began to find real coherence .
In a book on Kabbalah published in 1965 the author Gareth Knight attributes to Daath the Roman god Janus , the two - faced god of portals who is forever looking two ways .
However , some of the most vivid depictions of Da'ath as gateway were introduced in the mid 1970s in the writings of the British magician ( and joint biographer of Crowley ) Kenneth Grant .
What Grant has done can best be described by analogy .
Suppose we were to take a normal person and we identified all the occasions when this person was being generous and pleasant and kind , and we also identified all the occasions when they were being irritable and selfish and malicious .
Let us also suppose we gave this person two names ( Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde spring to mind ) and we insisted that instead of one person with a full range of emotions we were dealing with two different people each with a more limited range of emotions .
Having made this distinction we could then mystify the point of transition between the two identities  ( as Robert Louis Stevenson did in his novel by means of arcane chemistry ) .
This is what Grant has done to the Tree of Life , splitting it into two Trees , one of which is the dark reflection of the other , and he has turned Daath into the Gateway between the two Trees .
By removing much of the power from what many people think of as the normal 
Tree he has created a dark reflection of the Tree and by this legerdemain he has provided himself with material for a number of books :
I am fully aware that the averse regions of the power zones are dangerous territory , and at the outset I would remind those who feel that such an exploration had better not be made that one cannot begin this initiation , or journey inward , as one begins ones ascent from Malkuth , for only by projecting consciousness through Daath , the Gate of the Abyss , can one enter the Kingdom of infernal spaces that is under the dominion of Choronzon .
( NoE )
For reasons already given , the transformation of Daath into a hole or gateway is a natural and numinous transformation of a non-sephira into something that complements the images of transition and fear of the unknown associated with the Abyss .
Whether Grants splitting of the Tree into two is symbolically useful or merely an arch - gothic Adams Family caricature of a kabbalistic tradition already pregnant with representations for darkness and evil has to be questioned .
Grants work carries gematria to new heights by showing that any concept can be related to any other , either by numbers , or by the most bewildering and fanciful etymology , so that one has to wonder whether the author himself takes it seriously .
The overwhelming impression given by " The Nightside of Eden " is not that words and symbols signify anything , but they have become an end in themselves , and Grant uses them to weave Chorozonic mysteries of semiotics : the map has become the territory .
It is Kenneth Grant who brings a trail that begins with Lovecraft and meanders through the lives of Dee and Crowley back to Lovecraft once again .
His books are permeated with Lovecraftian imagery .
In The Magical Revival he compares Lovecraftian entities with entities from traditional magic .
In a later book he writes :
" This Cult of the Spectral Hyena persisted when all other forms of its God had perished , and certain magicians and dreamers have received intimations of its existence throughout the centuries .
Dr. John Dee ( 1527 -1608 ) , who first called it down from the spaces of Daath in historic times , named it Choronzon .
Aleister Crowley , who contacted it in our own times , also called it Choronzon , while H.P. Lovecraft sensed it as the monstrous and amorphous slime known as Yog - Sothoth " ( NoE )
We have come full circle , from fiction to fact and back to fiction , and if it is possible for Dee ( in the world of fiction ) to have translated the Necronomicon , then it is certainly possible for Lovecraft ( in the world of fact ) to have met Choronzon .
One of the best descriptions of Yog Sothoth can be found in Lovecrafts The Dunwich Horror , in a supposed extract from an incomplete copy of Dees translation of the Necronomicon :
Nor is it to be thought [ ran the text as Armitage mentally translated it ] that man is either the oldest or the last of earths masters , or that the common bulk of life and substance walks alone .
The Old Ones were , the Old Ones are , and the Old Ones shall be .
Not in the spaces we know , but between them , they walk serene and primal , undimensioned and to us unseen .
Yog - Sothoth knows the gate .
Yog - Sothoth is the gate .
Yog - Sothoth is the key and guardian of the gate .
Past , present , future , all are one in Yog - Sothoth .
He knows where the Old Ones broke through of old , and where They shall break through again .
He knows where
They have trod earth 's fields , and where They still tread them , and why no one can behold Them as They tread .
By Their smell can men sometimes know Them near , but of Their semblance can none know , saving only in the features of those
They have begotten on mankind ; and of those are there many sorts , differing in likeness from man 's truest eidolon to that shape without sight or substance which is Them .
( TDH )
Like the Nephilim of lore , Yog Sothoth can and does join with mortal women to father half - human abominations ( that is the whole point of the story ) .
The description of Yog Sothoth as the guardian and key to the gate entering into the chaotic dimensions of the Old Ones completes the identification with Choronzon , and it is at this point that fact and fiction blend so seamlessly into myth that in his book Tetragrammaton , Donald Tyson concludes about the Enochian Keys ( and one can feel the ghost of Lovecraft guiding his pen ) :
" The apocalypse glimpsed in the vision of St. John is a complex magical working that cannot be initiated by the angels themselves but must be called into the universe by the living Word vibrated in a vessel of flesh that wears the form of the warrior Christ .
The angels of wrath cannot call themselves into being .
What they could , and did , do is teach mankind how to summon them through the guardian gates of the Four Watchtowers that sustain the universe . "
" Once Coronzon and his angels gain access through the Watchtowers , their mere presence in our world will render it unfit for human habitation by increasing the degree of chaos and disrupting the balance of the natural laws that presently provide stability and order .
Coronzon will transform our universe into a suitable dwelling place for himself and his ministers , in the process destroying the human race . "
( Tetragrammaton )
Seriously , ca n’t the Republicans find anyone better to lead the charge against Obama than a hooker - loving Senator who shoves his way through alarmed - doors at airports because , apparently , he ’s more important than the little people ?
The incident happened at United , but I understand that Vitter mistakenly thought he was at Continental , and was hoping to get someone to move their tail for him .

SOUTHERN Cross University student Danielle Dyall regards herself as an optimist .
So although she cannot say exactly what has changed since Prime Minister Kevin Rudd apologised to the Stolen Generation on February 13 last year , she knows such a national outpouring of emotion must mean something .
“ The apology created a really deep feeling of unity .
Everyone in Australia heard it and felt something from it , ” Ms Dyall said .
“ We have n't really heard anything from the Government since , but when something as huge as that happens it has to lead to something - whatever that may be . ”
Ms Dyall is a member of the university 's Indigenous Events Co-ordinating Committee , which aims to foster reconciliation on campus .
Committee member and PhD student Judy Knox said a year on , Mr Rudd 's apology was proving insufficient .
“ There are all these lovely gestures , but they are not hitting the hard stuff , which is directing resources into Aboriginal communities and backing up the rhetoric with policies , ” she said .
Ms Knox is writing her PhD on the Government 's response to the apology .
“ The apology was directed to the Stolen Generation , but the rest of us also deserve an apology for past policies , ” she said .
“ It was a first step towards healing , but I can't see any direct impacts . ”
Bachelor of Indigenous Studies student Leearna Williams said she had not noticed a great deal of difference in general attitudes since the apology .
“ Not much has changed .
You are always going to get people who look at you because of the colour of your skin and no amount of apologies will change that , ” she said .

Rudd's ' sorry ' clears the way for healing : Ballina man
SOME time ago , as I emptied a big pot of pasta water into the sink and waited for the fog to lift from my glasses , a simple question occurred to me .
Why boil so much more water than pasta actually absorbs , only to pour it down the drain ?
Could n’t we cook pasta just as well with much less water and energy ?
Another question quickly followed : if we could , what would the defenders of Italian tradition say ?
After some experiments , I ’ve found that we can indeed make pasta in just a few cups of water and save a good deal of energy .
Not that much in your kitchen or mine  just the amount needed to keep a burner on high for a few more minutes .
But Americans cook something like a billion pounds of pasta a year , so those minutes could add up .
My rough figuring indicates an energy savings at the stove top of several trillion B.T.U.s .
At the power plant , that would mean saving 250,000 to 500,000 barrels of oil , or $ 10 million to $ 20 million at current prices .
Significant numbers , though these days they sound like small drops in a very large pot .
The standard method for cooking pasta , found in Italian cookbooks and on pasta packages , is to heat to a rolling boil 4 to 6 quarts of well - salted water per pound of pasta .
The usual rationales are that abundant water quickly recovers the boil when the pasta is added , gives the noodles room so that they do n’t stick to one another , and dilutes the starch they release , so they do n’t end up with a “ gluey ” surface .
Danny Choo is a guestblogger on Boing Boing .
Danny resides in Tokyo , and blogs about life in Japan and Japanese subculture – he also works part time for the empire .
When I first started to follow Japanese culture back in the UK , I saw these bags in anime ( Japanese cartoons ) , manga ( comics ) and in magazines .
I then came over to Japan and started to wonder why all the kids had one and why there were all the same shape n size .
These bags are known as " Randoseru " which is the Japanese pronunciation of the Dutch word " Ransel " meaning " Backpack " and are used by elementary school children in Japan .
They were first introduced into Japan as a backpack for commissioned officers in the imperial army during the Meiji period and then used in governmental schools as the standard commuting bag .
A randoseru is a compulsory school item that ones grandparents usually buy for their grandchildren and usually cost 2 kidneys and a bladder – the most expensive one in this store cost 628 USD !
The most expensive randoseru that I 've been able to find online costs 1805 USD from Rakuten .
Some modern schools these days do n't enforce use of the randoseru but those are still the minority .
An ad for randoseru below .
So now we know how much it costs to buy a randoseru for elementary school children , I thought we'd look at how much more it costs to send children to school in Japan – costs converted to USD .
- Kindergarten ( 3 years – public ) : 7,943 USD
- Kindergarten ( 3 years – private ) : 17,536 USD
- Elementary ( 6 years – public ) : 21,798 USD
- Elementary ( 6 years – private ) : 89,675 USD
- Junior High ( 3 years – public ) : 15,392 USD
- Junior High ( 3 years – private ) : 41,360 USD
- High School ( 3 years – public ) : 16 , 995 USD
- High school ( 3 years – private ) : 34,078 USD
- Total for all public ( 15 years ) : 62,130 USD
- Total for all private ( 15 years ) : 182,651 USD
University is not compulsory but for those wishing to go would spend an average of 54,412 USD for the 4 years .
Schooling free or cost a few limbs in your neck of the woods ?

For any other aborted business trip , it would be a reasonable request .
But Bank of America has been obliged to apologise for asking 23 staff to refund fares for the US Airways flight which splash - landed in New York 's Hudson River .
The bank 's employees were travelling to the firm 's corporate headquarters in Charlotte , North Carolina , when US ­Airways flight 1549 dramatically ditched off Manhattan last month .
In freezing temperatures , passengers were obliged to clamber onto semi-submerged wings and await rescue by ferry boats .
In the hours following the accident , Bank of America won praise for its response .
It helped supply dry clothes , swiftly arranged alternative transport home for its employees and even organised a locksmith for those who had left keys in abandoned luggage .
But a day or so later , the bank stained its copybook by emailing those involved and asking them to pay back their fares on the grounds that their business travel had been cancelled .
A Bank of America spokesman blamed mid-level employees for following standard procedure for cancelled trips .
" In this case , there was no expectation that they would have to return the money , " the bank told the Charlotte Observer .
" We apologised to them .
The bank is very sorry about this misunderstanding . "
All passengers on the flight were sent two cheques by US Airways - one for $ 5,000 to cover any immediate expenses and a second to return the cost of their tickets .
The aircraft 's crew were awarded ceremonial keys to the city of New York and captain Chesley Sullenberger has been praised as a hero for his airmanship in landing the stricken plane in one piece , allowing all 155 people on board to escape .
Several of the Bank of America staff on the flight were forgiving over their employer 's demand for a refund .
" I was completely cool with it , " Bank of America passenger Pam Seagle told US reporters .
" It was n't my money to begin with . "

In this adventure of Robinson Crusoe , the writer is so bitter that he takes it out on innocent characters in his own imagination , meanly depriving Crusoe of tools , supplies and opportunity .
Seven hundredths of a second after Crusoe thinks , ' I wonder if I could rescue some supplies from the ship ? ' , it sinks almost instantaneously with a perverse Champagne cork popping sound , into a trench a thousand fathoms deep .
Fish leap and play daily in Crusoe 's sight , but too far off for hand fishing .
The giant dwarf coconuts are 500 feet tall , but with mini-nuts that take ten minutes each to crack and yield one calorie .
The island 's unique tortoises can outrun him .
Scrounging for enough food to starve over years instead of days is an exhausting grind .
Crusoe can only dream of capital projects .
There appear to be sources for tool making , but always a little too far from food sources to consider risking .
The problem that Crusoe has , as delineated by many Austrian School economists , is that he must have savings in order to produce tools ( higher order capital goods ) .
Without savings of food , he has to continue as he is , hand gathering for subsistence .
Crusoe plans , estimates and saves a few scraps .
Then Friday shows up .
The two divide the subsistence chores and start to do a little better .
They work out a detailed plan -- by the standards of the island , it 's a massive capital project .
It involves building tools , and tools for building tools , in assembly line fashion .
The savings needed for them to complete their capital project according to their estimate -- a 30 day supply of food .
Crusoe has been maintaining a rather ambitious food storage cave .
He shows this to Friday .
It contains some pathetic food scraps of surplus over subsistence -- the space carefully organized for the bounty that never comes .
Friday , now with considerable excitement about the 30 day plan , examines the potential of the space .
After all this waiting , Crusoe is also catching emerging economy fever , and so as difficult as communication is for them anyway , they 're both hasty , and tragically fail to understand each other .
Friday thinks that Crusoe is showing a food storage cave prepared for Friday to store Friday 's surplus .
Crusoe had only intended to convey that Friday should prepare a similar larder .
The two men dive into the tasks of hand gathering food , sometimes working together , sometimes apart , in accordance with the master plan .
When they work together , Crusoe makes sure to leave half the production outside the food storage cave for Friday to move to his own larder .
Friday is a little puzzled by the extra work that Crusoe keeps leaving for him , but does n't wish to confront his friend , and so simply moves the food into the same cave later .
When Crusoe 's tally indicates that he has 30 days supply , he asks Friday what help he needs with finishing his supply , and is amazed at Friday 's indication that everything 's finished .
Both men are so elated that the savings plan went better than they 'd dared to imagine , that they even expand the tool building plan .
They dive in with a near delirium of hope and ambition .
They 're so excited and work so hard over the following days , that their savings are almost depleted before they realize the error .
The more they look at it , the more sobering the disaster begins to appear .
Without adequate saving to deal with all of the plan 's dependencies , it has turned into a trap .
None of the tools on their assembly line are more than half completed .
A lot of the early production went to make fresh vine lashings .
These lashings need to be in place on the constructed item within a few weeks at most , or they become useless .
A half completed fish weir will wash away without ever endangering a fish .
They become despondent as they look at the same picture everywhere -- it looks like some aggressively inattentive kids have been playing -- half dug pits , trampled brush , scattered rocks , chopped trees .
How could they have been so foolish ?
As a matter of fact it 's pretty easy .
Crusoe and Friday have just engaged in an accidental experiment with fractional reserve banking , absent the banks .
Perhaps ( since most central bankers have magic powers ) , Ben Bernanke was even there , sneaking in to rearrange the supply cave to make it look like the savings were abundant for a little longer so as to protect the illusion of growth .
Regardless , Crusoe and Friday both perceived that the same savings were available for their particular use .
The illusion lasted until they realized their mistake , and then their economy crashed .
As Crusoe and Friday try to recapture their subsistence methods , there 'll be further depressing damage assessment as they see how much of the low - hanging fruit , in some cases literally , they 've stripped away .
The assumption had been that the completed capital projects would more than make up for any lack of care and husbandry during early stages ( something we duplicate in real life bubble economies ) .
For Crusoe and Friday , it may be a more serious issue than just wasteful projects -- the upcoming time of malnourishment may kill them before they can regain their footing .
( From that perspective , we can also see that the quicker the crash came to their economic boom , the better off they were . )
Of course they note a radical difference in work energy from the period of boundless hope , to that of seemingly bottomless despair .
But noticing it wo n't entirely cure it .
( Rather similar to the way it 's useless for some idiot financial analyst on TV to decry that consumers are turning their pessimism into a self - fulfilling prophecy by failing to spend and / or borrow . )
Both ' Crusoe Economics ' and identification of the bubble - inducing problem of credit expansion are traditions of Austrian Business Cycle Theory .
I 've borrowed particularly from economist Jes 's Huerta de Soto for the above Crusoe and credit adventure .
But since I 've personally found a sarcasm - engendered catharsis to roll back the bitter tide for perhaps even as much as a full day , it 's at this point , while Crusoe and Friday have their heads in their hands , that a disoriented whale beaches next to them , and before they can recover from their astonishment , a lightening bolt knocks over and flames a dead palm , creating an impromptu barbecue pit .
( In the roots of the flaming palm , the two discover more than their collective weights in plump , wild sweet potatoes , with a scattering of wild herbs . )
Great rejoicing .
A barbecued whale for our sliding economy , however , absent an intervention from an advanced alien culture , would seem to have a problem of scale .
Too many credit bubbles have been layered on top of each other .
There 's nothing Fed Chairman Bernanke can do , with money or fish , to hide the waste any more .
Credit expansion from fractional reserves -- credit money out of ' thin air '-- must always leave us high and dry ( and whaleless ) at some point , but as perverse as it may seem , the sooner the better .

Bernanke Moves the Sun-Dried Fish ( Fun With Austrian - Style Crusoe Economics )
by Les Lafave
Even common trees are amazing enough , but some trees are just spectacular , whether by their sheer size , age or shape or through mysterious properties they seem to possess .
There ’s the tree that serves as the single sign of life in a vast barren desert , the ones as old as dinosaurs and the almost sinister yet beautiful trees that snake their roots through ancient temples .
There are undoubtedly hundreds of magnificent tree specimens in the world , as there are so many fascinating and visually stunning forests , but here is a selection of 15 particularly incredible trees that are nothing short of breathtaking .
Axel Erlandson ’s Circus Trees
Axel Erlandson was an American ‘ arborsculptor ’ who planted trees in specified patterns and pruned , bent and grafted them into shapes not seen in nature .
He opened a horticultural attraction in 1947 near Santa Cruz , California named “ The Tree Circus ” , and people flocked in from all over the country to view his unusual and striking creations .
After the land changed hands several times , 24 of Erlandson ’s trees ended up in the Gilroy Gardens amusement park .
The 5 pictured are the “ Basket Tree ” , “ Telephone Booth Tree ” , the “ Two Leg Tree ” and two with unknown names .
Pirangi Cashew Tree , Brazil
Upon approaching the world ’s largest cashew tree , you might think you ’re entering a forest .
But despite covering about 8,500 square meters , it is indeed a single tree .
The 117 - year - old tree , which is 80 times larger than an average cashew tree , has become a bit controversial ever since its roots started taking over a nearby highway , only allowing one car to pass at a time .
Specialists fear it might die if trimmed .
It currently takes up an area larger than a soccer field and bears 80,000 fruits per year .
Tree of Life , Bahrain
The Tree of Life ’s mystique is not its size , age or shape – though it is indeed large and beautiful .
What makes this 400 - year - old tree so amazing is the fact that it stands alone in a barren desert at the highest point in Bahrain , in an area that is completely free of water .
Where nothing else will grow , this tree seems to radiate with life .
Local inhabitants believe that it stands in the actual location of the Garden of Eden , and people flock to it in droves .
Chapel Oak of Allouville - Bellefosse
The Chêne - Chapelle , or Chapel Tree , of Allouville - Bellefosse is more than just a tree – it ’s also a religious monument and a building .
Already 500 years old in the 17th century , the tree – which had been hollowed out by a lightning strike – was made into a chapel with a small altar to the Virgin Mary by the Abbey of Detroit and Cerceau .
An additional chapel and staircase were added later .
Today the ‘ Chapel Oak ’ is France ’s most famous tree , and people struggle to protect it , covering damaged portions of its bark with wood shingles and supporting it with poles and cables .
Despite their best efforts , however , the tree may not last much longer – the crown is becoming smaller and smaller as each year passes .
Wawona ‘ Drive - Through ’
Tree
The ‘ Wawona ’ tree , the most famous among the Mariposa Grove of Big Trees in Yosemite National Park , stood at an incredible 227 feet tall .
It was 90 feet in circumference , and a hole big enough for park visitors to drive through had been cut in the base where it had sustained a fire scar .
As such , it ’s often called the ‘ Drive Through Tree ’ or the ‘ Tunnel Tree ’ .
Unfortunately , the Wawona tree fell in 1969 under an estimated two - ton load of snow .
It was approximately 2,300 years old .
Baobab Tree , Madagascar
Baobab trees may be the oldest life forms on the African continent , and many that are still standing today have been around since Roman times .
They ’re leafless for most of the year , and their thick , bloated , fire - resistant trunks store water during the dry months .
Some baobab trunks are so large that people live inside them .
Arabian legend about the baobab says “ the devil plucked up the baobab , thrust its branches into the earth and left its roots in the air ” .
This particular specimen , located in Madagascar , is referred to as the ‘ Teapot Baobab ’ .
General Sherman of Sequoia National Park
It ’s tough to get a sense of just how large the General Sherman tree in Sequoia National Park really is unless you see it in person .
Photographs hardly do it justice .
General Sherman is considered the largest ( though not tallest ) tree in the world , and it ’s also the most famous .
It stands at just under 275 feet tall , and the base of its trunk measures 102 feet in circumference .
In 2006 , its largest branch – itself bigger than most trees – fell off , but considering its height and trunk volume , even that did n’t affect its status as largest tree .
Tule Tree of Oaxaca , Mexico
In Oaxaca , Mexico stands a gnarly , knotted , gigantic cypress known as the ‘ Tule Tree ’ .
At 2,000 to 3,000 years old , it ’s one of the oldest living things known on earth , and some say it ’s the world ’s largest single biomass .
Its trunk measures an astounding 164 feet in circumference .
The Mixe people of the region believe the Tule Tree to be the walking stick of one of their gods , which took root and grew to the amazing size it is today .
Silk Cotton Trees of Ta Prohm , Cambodia
The temple of Ta Prohm , in Angkor , Cambodia , is still best known for the trees that snake their roots through it , despite its high - profile appearance in the ‘ Tomb Raider ’ movie .
It ’s a beautiful example of nature taking spaces back after long periods of human absence , with silk cotton and strangler fig tree roots seemingly wandering over the structures in search of soil and water .
The place has an eerie and romantic feel , making it a favorite destination for tourists .
Cambodian officials have decided to leave the trees alone to preserve the atmosphere of the temple .
Wollemi Pine , Australia

Though unique and beautiful , the interesting qualities of the Wollemi Pine lie not in its looks but in its history .
The Wollemi Pine is a “ living dinosaur ” , and was nearly extinct before it was discovered in Sydney , Australia in 1994 .
Now called “ the crown jewels of the botanical world ” , the Wollemi pine had previously been known only from a 120 - million - year - old fossil .
Very few exist in the wild , but conservation efforts have led to thousands being grown in nurseries all over the world and tree enthusiasts are encouraged to purchase them to grow in their own yards .
Dragon Tree , Canary Islands
The Dragon Tree at Icod de los Vinos in Tenerife , one of the Canary Islands , is quite an unusual specimen .
It has been said to be between 650 and 1,500 years old , though experts ca n’t say for sure since it does n’t have a single trunk , but rather many small trunks that cling together as they grow upward .
It has a dense umbrella - shaped canopy of leaves and gets its name for the resin that is secreted when the bark or leaves are cut , which is said to be the dried blood of dragons and was used in ancient times as a cure for various ailments .
Team owner Woody Johnson has stated clearly that he wants Brett Favre to be the New York Jets ' quarterback next season , but some players seem to be bristling at the thought .
Days after the Jets ' 1 - 4 finish left them out of the playoffs and helped trigger Eric Mangini 's firing as coach , running back Thomas Jones blasted Favre 's final - game performance and seemed to suggest the QB 's play -- nine interceptions and only two touchdown passes in the final five games -- called for his benching .
" We 're a team and we win together ... but at the same time , you can't turn the ball over and expect to win , " Jones said in an interview Tuesday with New York Hot 97 FM .
Favre threw three interceptions in the Jets ' season - ending 24 - 17 loss to Miami that clinched the AFC East for the Dolphins .
" The other day , the three interceptions really hurt us .
I mean , that 's just reality , " Jones told the radio station .
" If I were to sit here and say , ' Oh , man , it 's OK , ' that 's not reality .
... I do n't like it , I know everybody else on the team does n't like it .
Mervyn King urges the government not to introduce more fiscal aid in next month 's budget as Britain 's public finances are already in such dire straits
The government should not unveil any further fiscal stimulus in April 's budget as Britain 's public finances are already in such dire straits , Mervyn King warned today .
Appearing before the Treasury select committee , the Bank of England governor said : " Given how big those deficits are , I think it would be sensible to be cautious about going further in using discretionary measures to expand the size of those deficits . "
" There is no doubt that we are facing very large fiscal deficits over the next two to three years , " he added .
The chancellor of the exchequer , Alistair Darling , introduced a £ 20bn stimulus package in November , but King said the government should be careful about further plans as the country 's public coffers are under even greater pressure from falling tax revenues and higher benefit payouts .
Darling will unveil his next budget on 22 April .
The governor 's caution over a second round of fiscal stimulus measures followed a call from former cabinet minister , Stephen Byers , for the chancellor to abandon the centrepiece of his November package - the temporary cut in VAT to 15 % .
He said it had " run its course both in terms of its overall benefit to the economy and in relation to the political return that comes to the government " .
The Office for National Statistics last week reported a £ 9bn deficit in February , bringing total public - sector net borrowing for the first 11 months of the fiscal year to a record £ 75 bn - more than £ 50 bn higher than for the same period last year .
King also revealed that the Bank 's purchases of gilts in its quantitative easing ( QE ) programme may end up being less than the planned £ 75 bn pounds if the programme works .
Graham Turner at GFC Economics said : " If a central bank is going to do QE , it is pretty pointless flip - flopping on the amount of bonds that may be bought , particularly straight after the release of a higher than expected inflation report .
It sows significant doubts in the minds of gilt investors : the BoE is not really committed to QE , because it genuinely fears a return of inflation .
The policy is unlikely , therefore , to succeed , which is unfortunate , because so far the evidence of QE pushing corporate borrowing costs down is limited anyway . "
Meanwhile , tension is expected to mount between the prime minister , Gordon Brown , and European commission president , Jose Manuel Barroso , over further fiscal stimuli when they meet this afternoon at the London summit on the financial crisis .
Brown said Europe may not have done enough , despite injecting nearly £ 370bn into EU economies , and that the G20 meeting may have to make further decisions on spending , but Barroso is trying to rein in the prime minister 's ambitions .
Shadow chancellor , George Osborne , said : " Today , not only has a former Labour cabinet minister attacked the ineffective VAT cut , but the governor of the Bank of England no less has said Britain cannot afford a further fiscal stimulus .
He goes on to say that monetary policy should be the main tool to tackle the recession .
" This is hugely significant , as it completely vindicates the big decision taken by David Cameron and myself on the economy , and it leaves Gordon Brown 's political plans for the G20 and the budget in tatters .
It is the prime minister who is now isolated at home and abroad . "

Yesterday , I briefly talked about flax .
Today we will discuss hemp , and look for another post about chia seeds soon !
What do you think of when I say “ hemp ” ?
I think of marijuna and hippy homeless young women selling homemade hemp bracelets on the streets .
However , hemp is appearing everywhere now in the form of hemp milk , hemp seed , hemp protein powder , etc .
I decided it was time to look into the matter and see what all of the hype was about .
( I will do a food tasting review of hemp at the bottom of this page , but in case you ca n’t wait to find out , hemp seeds taste great - a little like pine nuts ) .
Benefits
Hemp is a high protein seed containing all nine of the essential amino acids ( like flax ) .
It also has high amounts of fatty acids and fiber as well as containing vitamin E and trace minerals .
It has a balanced ratio of omega 3 to 6 fats at around a three to one ratio .
This wo n’t help correct your omega balance if it ’s off , but it gives you the right balance to start with .
Further the protein content of the hemp seed is supposed to be very digestible .
Many people noted their personal experience of finding that hemp seed protein did not cause bloating or gas , like some of their whey , or other protein shakes did .
And , get this , unlike soy which has super high amounts of phytic acid ( that anti-nutrient that prevents us from absorbing minerals ) , hemp seed does n’t contain phytic acid .
At the very least , this makes hemp seed a step up from soy .
The Body Ecology Diet site has an article discussing hemp here .
It contains a list of benefits including what I mentioned above plus including some others as well .
Hemp contains :
* All 20 amino acids , including the 9 essential amino acids ( EAAs ) our bodies cannot produce .
* A high protein percentage of the simple proteins that strengthen immunity and fend off toxins .
* Eating hemp seeds in any form could aid , if not heal , people suffering from immune deficiency diseases .
This conclusion is supported by the fact that hemp seed has been used to treat nutritional deficiencies brought on by tuberculosis , a severe nutrition blocking disease that causes the body to waste away .
3
* Nature ’s highest botanical source of essential fatty acid , with more essential fatty acid than flax or any other nut or seed oil .
* A perfect 3:1 ratio of Omega - 6 Linoleic Acid and Omega - 3 Linolenic Acid – for cardiovascular health and general strengthening of the immune system .
* A superior vegetarian source of protein considered easily digestible .
* A rich source of phytonutrients , the disease - protective element of plants with benefits protecting your immunity , bloodstream , tissues , cells , skin , organs and mitochondria .
* The richest known source of polyunsaturated essential fatty acids .
This article claims that because hemp ’s protein is in the globulin edistin form it is a superior source of protein .
It ends that thought with this paragraph .
“ The best way to insure the body has enough amino acid material to make the globulins is to eat foods high in globulin proteins .
Since hemp seed protein is 65 % globulin edistin , and also includes quantities of albumin , its protein is readily available in a form quite similar to that found in blood plasma .
Eating hemp seeds gives the body all the essential amino acids required to maintain health , and provides the necessary kinds and amounts of amino acids the body needs to make human serum albumin and serum globulins like the immune enhancing gamma globulins .
Eating hemp seeds could aid , if not heal , people suffering from immune deficiency diseases .
This conclusion is supported by the fact that hemp seed was used to treat nutritional deficiencies brought on by tuberculosis , a severe nutrition blocking disease that causes the body to waste away .
[ Czechoslovakia Tubercular Nutritional Study , 1955 ] “
Can it make you high ?
In short , no .
To grow marijuna you have to have special seed that grows a plant high in THC , the property responsible for the drug response .
Commercial hemp seed contains very low amounts , plus they contain a substance that counteracts THC .
Dr. David
West says :
“ Reality : Hemp oil is an increasingly popular product , used for an expanding variety of purposes .
The washed hemp seed contains no THC at all .
The tiny amounts of THC contained in industrial hemp are in the glands of the plant itself .
Sometimes , in the manufacturing process , some THC - and CBD - containing resin sticks to the seed , resulting in traces of THC in the oil that is produced .
The concentration of these cannabinoids in the oil is infinitesimal .
No one can get high from using hemp oil .
” Hemp and Marijuana :
Myths & Realities
Nutiva also answers that concern
“ Q: What is the difference between hemp and marijuana ?
A. Marijuana and hemp both come from the same species of plant , Cannabis sativa L. , but from different varieties .
There are different varieties of Cannabis , just as Chihuahuas and St. Bernards are different breeds of dogs , Canis familiari .
Marijuana is the flowering tops and leaves of psychoactive varieties of Cannabis that are grown for their high THC content .
Hemp , also referred to as industrial hemp , are low - THC varieties of Cannabis that are grown for their seeds and fiber .
Hemp is grown legally in just about every industrialized country except the USA ”
Nutiva , as well as other companies , are part of the “ Test Pledge ” .
It ’s a pledge that their products wo n’t have amounts of THC in them that would cause someone to fail a drug test .
Was it Historically used as a food ?
One thing is clear .
Hemp has been grown for a long time .
It may even be one of the first crops .
Hemp was used for making paper , clothes , and ropes and oil for lamps .
But was it produced for food , or was it simply eaten in times of famine ?
It looks like it was definitely used as a medicine for a variety of uses .
The Chinese especially utilized hemp seed for medicine .
Go here for some of the historical medicinal uses of hemp seed .
This quote gives a good overview of some of the information I found about the historical uses of hemp as food .
“ The use of hemp for food and medicine may be as old as the human race itself .
Recent interest in the seed arises from the awareness of the nutritional need for omega - 6 and omega - 3 essential fatty acids , as well as the need for cheap sources of protein to feed a burgeoning population in Asia and the developing world .
In addition to its nutritional value , hemp seed has demonstrated positive health benefits , including the lowering of cholesterol and high blood pressure .
In the second century , Galen recorded that some people enjoyed eating fried hemp seeds with their desserts .
As recently as the 1950 ’s in Southern Africa , mothers of the Sotho tribe served the ground seed “ with bread or mealie - pap ” to children during weaning .
Human uses of hemp seed for food are naturally found in India where the oil is pressed to provide a table oil , and in Russia where the oil is made into a kind of hemp butter or margarine .
In Europe , it was once required of monks that three meals made of hemp seed were eaten daily , whether in soups , gruel , or porridges .
In the belief that the spirits of dead relatives visit every Christmas Eve , the Polish and Lithuanian people prepared them a soup of hemp seed which was called “ semieniatka ” .
The Ukrainian and Latvian people made a similar offering on the day of Three Kings .
In China , hemp seed was consumed by farmers in the north and the seed were listed as a famine food for the starving multitudes of China near the end of World War II .
Australians also used the seed during two famines in the nineteenth century .
Today ’s hemp seed products are being developed on the working premise of that which can be done with flax seed and soy beans might also be applied to hemp seed .
Very basic food preparation , and the processing techniques have been the start of such seemingly remarkable foods as a hemp seed tofu and a low fat cheese substitute that even melts and stretches like real cheese . ”
Source
I felt like the historical use of hemp as a food seems about as high as the case for flax historically being used as a food ( some people think that flax was just a “ famine food ” as well . )
Ending Thoughts
I would like to give hemp a chance , but would like to see more long term studies done on hemp before I add it into my daily diet .
It does seem like the Chinese consumed it for a long period of time , and that reassures me .
I would just like to read a little more about the long term effects of eating it often .
Like flax , I wonder if hemp seed is really meant to be consumed on a constant basis in the form of hemp milk , hemp cheese and hemp protein shakes .
That seems to be taking moderation out of the picture .
I do n’t like overly processed foods , so if we were to start adding in hemp seed , it would be in the form of hemp seeds , pure and simple .
I also do n’t think that hemp should replace your animal protein sources - but that does n’t mean it could n’t have a place in your diet .
One last note , I mentioned yesterday that flax was high in phytoestrogens ( in fact , even higher than soy ) , from what I can tell from my reading , hemp either does n’t contain any phytoestrogens or very little .
( One article said it has some and a bunch of others claimed it did n’t have any ) .
I will try to keep my eye out for more information about hemp and flax .
Hemp Product Review
This post was really inspired by some samples of Nutiva ’s hemp products .
I had received some of their Organic Coconut Oil ( which is great ) and some of their different hemp products which they generously gave me .
I have been impressed with the quality of products we received from them .
Here are some of my thoughts on the samples I received .
You can buy Nutiva hempseeds for a great price here at my Amazon affiliate , ( other products below are linked to with an affiliate link ) .
Hemp Seeds
Their hemp seed taste great !
A very nutty , almost sweet taste .
I would have to say that it tastes almost like a pine nut , but a bit more mellow .
I can imagine it would be great in a variety of dishes .
Hemp Oil
This has a slightly nutty flavor and lightly green color ( similar to some olive oil in color ) .
I could imagine adding it to a salad dressings , but not using just hemp oil for the oil part .
Organic Hemp and Flax Seed Bars
These were delicious .
Sweetened only with honey , they were just perfect in their level of sweetness .
Of course , none of the seeds in these bars are soaked and dehydrated , but they sure were good !
All three of us liked them .
If it was n’t for the enzyme inhibitors in seeds , I would definitely like to have these bars around for a quick bite on the run .
HempShakes
We found that we like these better when added to a smoothie base of frozen bananas and coconut milk .
Done this way , they were pretty delicious .
Hemp Protein Powder
We actually have n’t tried this yet , but it seems like it could be a great source of protein .
So there are my thoughts .
What about you ?
Do you have concerns , or do you consume them often ?

You do n't need to know my name .
I was just a lowly salesman at Circuit City .
But know that these people losing their jobs are not just my coworkers .
They are my friends .

[ The following words are quotes from the tales of over a dozen real CC sales folks , managers , liquidators , and corporate workers .
I 've used them to create a insider 's look at what it felt like to be inside the country 's number 2 electronics retailer as it fell to economic hardship .
May all Circuit City workers , like everyone losing their jobs these days , find meaningful , honest work in the near future .
Special thanks goes to those who contributed to this story . ]
We 've all known the closing was probably going to come sooner than later .
It has been so frustrating doing sales for the past 3 - 4 months having to persuade customers to make purchases because of the company 's problems .
I 've never pushed anyone into a sale I did n't think was worth their time ... I have no real reason to anyways due to my lack of commission .

Being an active member of the Circuit City Associate Forum community , an online message board which Circuit City associates could post to using their employee logins , I constantly read through the things which get posted within the forums .
On January 9th I remember hitting that F5 button to refresh the page and reading the news that announced the company 's intention to sell itself .
I was the first to find out at my location and broke the news to the managers and supervisors , we stood in silence for a moment around our firedog counter in shock and then began to wonder what to do .
Our future was an uncertainty .
On January 16th we all woke up and went to work .
We did n't expect the speed of the judgment , at about 10:22 am a TV in the break room had been tuned to CNBC and were reporting their breaking news about Circuit City beginning the liquidation process and closing its stores nationwide .
Four of us watched the announcement ; thirty - four thousand associates were now going to become a part of the unemployment statistic .
Corporate made an official announcement to our associates 20 minutes after that news segment .
On the day the liquidation was announced a few employees spent most of the day crying , these were mostly people who had worked there for most of their adult life .

Once the sales started on Saturday morning , a sick feeling crept over my stomach .
Every weekend up to this , we 've been pretty dead .
We 'd stand around for the first hour doing almost nothing , except help the 1 - 2 customers that came in at this time .
Saturday felt like Black Friday , only in this year 's case , busier
All over 10 - 30 % , when we had much better deals weeks ago ; when our store actually cared about the customer .
It 's very depressing seeing these customers , in which I nicknamed " vultures " , not even giving a crap at how we are losing our jobs , but wanting only a deeper discount .
Advertisement
Liquidation beings out the best and worst in some people .
I 'm not patting myself on the back here , but standing at the CSA counter , I get to see almost everything .
The first day of the announcement , we received a fair number of phone calls from people expressing their condolences before going about their usual business .
Those calls were nice and a bit heartwarming .
Inversely , we got plenty of phone calls from people that wanted to know when our going out of business sales started and how much they would save .
It was sickening to say the least .
Plenty of people have bad things to say about Circuit City , just like any other retailer .
Personally , I always felt this was one of the good stores .
But these past 2/3 weeks have been CRAZY .
We lost our manager a few weeks ago because he needed to be closer to home because of his kid on the way .
We then got a new manager who JUST left a few days ago .
We 've since got some new guy who I 've only met once .... could n't even tell you his name .
Keeping track of who 's in charge has been hell .
Advertisement
So have policies .
When we first started liquidation , we stopped all installs .
Then we got the ok to keep doing them .
We 've since been told to stop .
Our uniform changes daily from fully dressed , to casual , to half - way , to undies and tin foil hats .
The biggest problem that I just found out about from a friend of mine involves bonuses .
The liquidation company gives bonuses to Circuit City employees depending on how their stores sell after liquidation is over .
There have been mixed messages over who is supposed to receive a bonus , but I 've since heard tonight that only the salaried managers will be receiving bonuses so I expect there will be some commotion coming up in the next few days .
Never mind bonuses .
One of the main gripes associates currently have is the complete loss of any accrued Paid Time Off , some associates had as many as 140 hours of it that had accrued from never taking a vacation in a year , which has now disappeared into a puff of smoke
Advertisement
All employees are pretty much security guards nowadays ... that is only when we 're not putting up liquidations signs for 9 bucks an hour .
Instead of having to greet every customer , now we just have to patrol the store .
Good luck getting help though ... most of us really would not like to hassle the manager for his key to grab that camera for you .
The mindset has n't always been this , but liquidation has changed the attitude of most for the worse .
Advertisement
I 've really become close to the people I work with over my time at the store , and this closing has only brought us even more together .
Every day I walk in , and I feel like I 'm saying a premptive goodbye to my extended family .
Circuit City was my first " real " job , besides some basic part time work before .
I 've seen managers come and go , and I honestly think I work for one of the greatest management staffs one could ask for .
These are not just my coworkers or bosses , they are my friends .
While we all try to make the best of a terrible situation , some customers are there to send us back to careless land .
90 % of all customers that walk into the store approach me and ask when they 'll be having " all the good deals " to which I always say " I HAVE NO FRIGGIN IDEA " .
Circuit City did not exist anymore .
The liquidators were in control of the prices and we had no control of anything .
We do n't even know when they were going to lower the prices .
It 's for this reason most of us have hid some type of item we 've been eying throughout the store so we can buy them later when the prices are lower ( haha ) .
We 've already had the cops over a few times and I expect them to keep visiting due to the continuation of violent shoppers with nasty attitudes .
Advertisement
We 've had our share of customers come in yelling that they 've been screwed over by us in some fashion .
This may sound like rhetoric , but 30,000 + associates are about to lose their jobs - how do you think we feel ?
I 've had customer say they are glad that we 're going out of business , all because we can't return their XBox game that they bought , opened , and did n't like .
I 'm sorry , but how does losing $ 30 on a game compare to someone that is about to lose their livelihood ?
I 'm not looking to make this a topic of money , but some associates here live paycheck to paycheck , and the thought of not having a job is scary .
Some associates here just bought a new house , a new car , just got married , or just had a child .
Impending job loss is devastating to them .
I 'm seeing it first hand .
The normally happy - go - lucky attitude of some people is just gone altogether .
It 's sad .
I 've always joked that I hope Best Buy went under before us ( somehow ) or that when CompUSA went under that I saw it coming .
Now ... I regret saying those things .
Watching your store , your second home , your second family , go away in front of you is depressing .
I 'm not going to place blame on anyone .
It would be so easy to fault the liquidators , the customers , the executives , etc .
However , pointing fingers wo n't take the pain away .
Anyone that has every had to go through a liquidation or lose their job I 'm sure feels the same way .
We had to take things the best we could .
We tried to laugh and joke and talk about what stuff we may buy when it gets low enough ... things to enjoy the last few weeks here .
We still helped customers when and how we can , but our power was so limited .
I used to have the ability to do practically anything in the store , but that was taken away .
I could n't do anything but ring up .
Advertisement
We also had signs that said " PLEASE DO NOT OPEN CARTONS " and apparently that meant open whatever you want .
Which creates a chain reaction of people wanting to open boxes and check to make sure that everything is in there .
Which then absolutely destroys the box and then customers demand discounts on those boxes .
Advertisement
Now this all got worse as the sales went on .
I mean cursing , threatening , and just plain flipping a shit .
We had one customer buy something only to return 20 min. later from Best Buy saying that he got ripped off and it was cheaper at Best Buy .
Now while that was true , there are signs that say no returns ALL OVER THE STORE .
Had some more reports of customers being really degrading to employees , to the tune of " Ca n't you knock off another $ 200 on this , it 's not like your job matters " , and others just being generally inconsiderate , the only bonus to those situations is that we technically no longer have to bend over backwards to please them , so if they upset us or do something stupid we can let them know and not get into trouble .
For anyone who 's worked in retail a store closing liquidation sale is probably one of the best times to do it , primarily because if a customer complains about your attitude , or your level of service it does n't matter , hell we kinda joke about it to be honest , " What , he was rude to you , well we just have to let him go .
Mr. Employee on March 31st I 'm going to let you go ! " , in some stores that conversation happens in front of customers , which has frustrated them further because it's the complete opposite reaction of what customers are used to , traditionally you complain to a manager and they scold the employee , now some stores will just mock the customers , sure it 's wrong , but honestly they had it coming for some of the idiot demands they have , especially in our time of loss .

We act the same way our customers do ( if they get angry , we get angry , if they are nice , we are ) , though before my store would bend over backwards to treat the customer right , unlike the Circuit City horror stories I read on Consumerist , which motivated me to do the right thing for the customer which included telling the customer that all HDMI cables under a certain feet were the same for one .
Our store was great at treating customers , and such .
It 's like just because your brother is a bad egg , does n't mean you are .
Still , the rules were gone as far as customer care went .
See , for some reason some folks seem to love bragging about God , being one of the folks who have to call people you'd be amazed how many voice mail boxes you get with people going " God is good all the time , and all the time God is good " , or " God loves you ! " , or and I shit you not , the voice mailbox plays some Christian style music , used to drive me nuts !
So , on one of my last day at the store I decide to work the front register and this one lady calls up the store and I happily pickup the phone

Me : " Thank you for calling Circuit City , how can I help you today ? "
Her : " Yeah , I wanted to know what the discounts were at now on laptops ? "
M : " They 're 10 % "
H : " But the sign says 30 % outside ? "
M : " Up to 30 % , laptops are still 10 % "
H : " Oh , is it true you guys are going out of business ? "
M : " Yes man "
H : " Wow , you guys have been around for ever
M : " Yeah , # 2 consumer electronics retail store and we 're forced to close our doors because the economy failed us and now 34,000 employees are without jobs , all because people did n't wanna go out and spend money to we could keep operating . "
H : " Wow , that 's terrible what 's your name ?
M : " Ted "
H : " Well Ted , are you a Christian ? "
Now , like I said above , it 's not so much a bad customer , so much as an example of policies going out the window .
There I am on the phone with a lady who , while polite and all , was about to do something I did not want to deal with on my last day .
She was about to preach to me about how God does things for a reason , and God has a plan , blah , blah , I have no interest in listening to this , customer like this drive me nuts .
Really , God made Circuit City fail so that 34,000 other people could lose their jobs , among other companies doing lay offs and such .
While I am Christian , I was not in the mood for this .
I hung up on her .
Wow , that was rude of me , probably one of the worst things I 've done in retail , especially to a customer who was trying to be polite and caring and what not , I just had no interest in hearing it .
So I stand at the register for a couple moments and the phone rings again , so I decide to try something slightly different , so in as thick a Russian accent as I can put on I answer the phone .

M : " Zank you for callink Zirkuit Zity , how kan I help you ? "
H : " Hi , I was just talking to Ted a moment ago "
M : " Zorry ma'am but Ted valked avay , how kan I help you ?
H : " I wanted to know if Toshibas were on sale ? "
M : " Yez ma'am , Toshibas are all 10 % off , as are all laptops "
H : " Ok , well I know it 's you Ted and I just wanted to mention that you 're an asshole "
Uh oh , the gig is up
M : " Alright , thanks ma'am buh bye ! "
And hang up again .
For a christian about to preach to me she sure did n't mind calling me an asshole , while probably not the story you were expecting I want you to play that out in your head and tell me that 's not hilarious .
The way she said it " I know it'd you Ted " , man it was awesome .
Prime example of the rule book being tossed .
I actually used the name Ted too , every person I talk to finds the story funny cause she was like " I know it 's you Ted " .

In another store , our associates are coming to work and the moral is NOT rock bottom .
This is mainly because this stores general manager who has been with two other companies as they liquidated .
He is providing great support to all the associates .
They also happen to be lucky enough to have a great " consultant " aka the guy calling all the shots now .
The liquidation consultant , Phil , has bought everyone in the store pizza for lunch / dinner and often comes in the morning with a few big boxes of coffee and donuts .

There was a lot of stolen stuff from the store .
Mostly empty game cases and the biggest section with loss was ..... Spanish music .
I would find tons of CD cases just open with nothing in them .
The biggest problem our store has faced is internal theft from those who no longer respect their work place .
These are some quotes from some emails the director of asset protection sent out in regards to a private firm hired to conduct all AP tasks ...

" " Team ,
As Debbie shared , we have experienced significant shrink issues pushing us to over 160 internal theft cases and nearly $ 400 K in case value in just 6 days .
I would prefer not to spend the money and yet we have members of the team , ( including management ) , that have resorted to theft and fraud over the past 6 days .

This engagement by Protiviti is to ensure the integrity of the inventory as we close down the stores in the company .
I also want to make it clear that this is not the liquidators initiative or project , but is a CC project that we are driving with the liquidators as partners .
This is just one component of the Asset Protection Plan , and we need all of your help as we close the stores remaining vigilant on inventory management and holding yourselves and others to a standard of integrity .
Like you , we are all impacted by this close down .
The first inclination might be to throw up our hands and not show the concern that is warranted to these issues .
I on the other hand subscribe to the idea that most of our people are honest and show integrity .
Unfortunately , there are those that do n't make good decisions , which require us to take the appropriate actions to limit the exposure .
I sincerely wish all of you well and welcome your feedback . "

The biggest let down that I personally experienced was the fact that thousands of people who shopped with us this week could have saved the company by shopping a few weeks ago .
The prices are higher than a month ago , yet we are selling much more than ever before just because there is a big " going out of business sign " above our door .
People are just stupid ...
I have n't bought a single thing since the announement ( then again they did take away our decent employee discount ) .
Now here it was the final day .
We opened and were immediately rushed with people .
I mean it was crazy .
Now we still had some software and ink , plenty of cables , plenty of media , along with other random stuff .
At 1 PM a manager came on the loud speaker .
" For the next 20 minutes only take and additional 50 % off of everything . "
So that continued for two hours .
At 3 he started naming stuff that we had plenty of ( like ink and cables ) and said that the stuff is $ 1 .
So I grabbed a PlayNC card for $ 1 .
And back to work .
By 4 PM most of the stuff had died down , but we still had plenty of cables and ink .
The liquidator just grabbed a cart , filled it with random shit and said " WHOLE CART FOR $ 1 " .
So everything else went out the door fast .
But a buddy of mine did come up with gold .
He got a lens ( which was in plain sight and was n't stashed ) and a flash for $ 10 .
Now the lens was a $ 400 lens and the flash was $ 200 .
So I 'm sure he ebayed that for some pocket .
Advertisement
I looked in a shelving unit to see if anyone had stashed anything for the final days ( we searched the entire store and found tons of stuff .
Lucky for the people who came the next morning to find GTA IV for $ 2 ) .
I had found an entire stash of acc. such as remotes and instructions for iPod docks and various stereos , including an Apple product with the remote and every dock adapter made .
So logically I ask my manager what do do with all this stuff .
" Trash it . "
Well can I have the iPod thing ?
" No , trash it . "
Awesome .
So i proceed to throw away all this stuff .
So now the customers were out , we were closed and the cleaning started .
Mostly taking down all the signs and getting all the fixtures to the front ( they continued to be open until the end of Dec. for selling those ) .
We would all come back the next day to face our final day as CCity employees .
Advertisement
We walked in and talked at the front for a little bit , then started the rest of the clean up .
That took a good 4 hours .
Then we got a treat I did n't expect .
We were told we were going to watch a tape of one of my managers on Divorce Court .
Wow .
That was gold .
After that we all stepped into the store managers office for the final time as he clicked on the termination button .
Most employees stayed for a little while and played football in the store and talked .
Later we left and parted ways .
Some of our skilled associates in the company who 've developed good working friendships with their co-workers are planning on opening their own shops based around their skill , TV installs , PC repairs , or car installs , it 's kinda neat , but overall all sad at the same time .
Advertisement
All I can say , from the perspective of a closing store associate is this : Remember next time you walk in any other retailer / store that is closing - this company is made up of people , just like you and me .
We 're just ordinary individuals trying to make our way in the world .
It 's one thing to hate the company because of a bad experience , but a majority of us are good people , and it 's heartbreaking to see how some people just do n't care .
I 'm not asking anyone to pull a 180 on their views of the company .
All I ask is that if you have negative , malicious thoughts , please keep them to yourselves .
Life is going to be hard enough for some of us as is once we are gone , it does n't help to have someone scream in your face " I 'm glad you 're going out of business "
This company gave me a lot , and I 'm slowly seeing it fade away .
For a generation , the Polaroid camera gave near - instant pleasure to millions of users around the world , chronicling everything from births and weddings to the downright explicit .
But when digital photography came along in the 1990s – with instant images and the ability to edit and delete pictures before they see the light of day – Polaroid was doomed , its iconic white - framed snaps apparently defunct .
When Polaroid announced last February that it would stop production of its instant film , it seemed the much - loved camera was gone forever .
But within weeks , a group of users had started a global campaign for the format to return .
And now , thanks to an unlikely saviour , their pleas have been heard .
If all goes to plan , the Polaroid factory in Enschede , Amsterdam , will soon be making film again thanks to its new owner , an eccentric Austrian artist and businessman named Florian Kaps .
Mr Kaps , 39 , has dedicated the past five years to instant photography .
He set up Polanoid.net , the biggest Polaroid gallery on the web , and the first ever Polaroid - only art gallery in Vienna , called Polanoir .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Now he plans to save the film .
" The project is more than a business plan ; it 's a fight against the idea that everything has to die when it does n't create turnover , " said Mr Kaps .
Dubbed " The Impossible Project " , the development of new film for Polaroid cameras launches today .
Working with the Manchester - based black and white photography company Ilford , the machinery is in place to produce film of two exposure types , each compatible with both the classic SX - 70 cameras popular with artists and the more modern 600 series .
Work has begun on a prototype .
By hiring 11 of the original Polaroid team from the factory floor , Mr Kaps aims to mass produce both colour and black and white film under the Impossible label by December , coinciding with the projected date that existing stocks will run out .
Men who are very sexually active in their twenties and thirties are more likely to develop prostate cancer , especially if they masturbate frequently , according to a study of more than 800 men .
However the UK research team also found that frequent sexual activity in a man ’s forties appears to have little effect and even small levels of activity in a man ’s fifties could offer protection from the disease .
Most of the differences were attributed to masturbation rather than sexual intercourse .
The study , led by the University of Nottingham , looked at the sexual practices of more than 431 men who had been diagnosed with prostate cancer before the age of 60 , together with 409 controls .
Men who took part in the study were asked about all aspects of their sex life from their twenties onwards , including how old they were when they became sexually active , how often they masturbated and had intercourse , how many sexual partners they had had and whether they had had any sexually transmitted diseases .
“ We were keen to look at the links between sexual activity and younger men as a lot of prostate cancer studies focus on older men as the disease is more prevalent in men over 50 ” says lead author Dr Polyxeni Dimitropoulou , who is now at the University of Cambridge .
“ Hormones appear to play a key role in prostate cancer and it is very common to treat men with therapy to reduce the hormones thought to stimulate the cancer cells .
A man ’s sex drive is also regulated by his hormone levels , so this study examined the theory that having a high sex drive affects the risk of prostate cancer . ”
The study participants , who were recruited by their family doctors , were asked to fill in a questionnaire about their sexual habits in each decade of their life since their twenties .
All the men with prostate cancer had been diagnosed in their fifties .
Most of the men who took part in the study ( 97 % ) were white and the majority were currently married ( 84 % ) or widowed , separated or divorced ( 12 % ) .
A number of interesting points came out of the study :
59 % of the men in both groups said that they had engaged in sexual activity ( intercourse or masturbation ) 12 times a month or more in their twenties .
This fell steadily as they got older , to 48 % in their thirties , 28 % in their forties and 13 % in their fifties .
39 % of the cancer group had had six female partners or more , compared with 31 % of the control group .
Men with prostate cancer were more likely to have had a sexually transmitted disease than those without prostate cancer .
More men with prostate cancer fell into the highest frequency groups in each decade when it came to sexual activity ( intercourse and masturbation ) than men in the control group .
40 % of men in the cancer group fell into the highest frequency category in their twenties ( 20 or more times a month ) compared to 32 % in the control group .
Similar patterns were observed in the men ’s thirties and forties .
By the fifties it had evened out , with 31 % in each group falling into the most frequent category ( ten or more times a month ) .
Men with prostate cancer were also more likely to masturbate frequently than men in the control group , with the greatest difference in the twenties ( 34 % versus 24 % ) and thirties ( 41 % versus 31 % ) .
The differences were less pronounced in their forties ( 34 % versus 28 % ) and by the fifties the cancer group was slightly lower ( 25 % versus 26 % ) .
“ What makes our study stand out from previous research is that we focused on a younger age group than normal and included both intercourse and masturbation at various stages in the participants ’ lives , ” says Dr Dimitropoulou .
“ Overall we found a significant association between prostate cancer and sexual activity in a man ’s twenties and between masturbation and prostate cancer in the twenties and thirties .
However there was no significant association between sexual activity and prostate cancer in a man ’s forties .
“ A possible explanation for the protective effect that men in their fifties appear to receive from overall sexual activity , and particularly masturbation , is that the release of accumulated toxins during sexual activity reduces the risk of developing cancer in the prostate area .
This theory has , however , not been firmly established and further research is necessary . ”
Donated scout land often ends up as cash cow

Arias ) A view of harvested land at Camp McCroskey Boy Scout Camp near Tensed Idaho , on Tuesday June 10 , 2008 ( Photo / Seattle Post - Intelligencer , Gilbert W. Arias ) Photo : Gilbert W.

It 's been 62 years since conservationist Virgil McCroskey gave the Boy Scouts 400 acres of timberland near this village in Idaho 's panhandle , with big ideas for a big new camp .
But do n't expect any pup tents or even the faintest whiff of smoke from Camp McCroskey these days .
Rarely used for camping , the land instead has become a moneymaker for the Inland Northwest Council of Boy Scouts .
Over the past 35 years , the council has repeatedly logged the property , collecting hundreds of thousands of dollars .
Some of the money helped pay the mortgage on council headquarters in far - off Spokane , a former council board member says .
Never mind that McCroskey specified how the scouts should use the land when he deeded it in 1947 : " for camp and recreational purposes , the site to be known as Virgil Talmadge McCroskey Camp . "
Council officials interpret McCroskey 's deed to mean they can log the land , so long as revenues are spent on anything related to " recreational purposes . "
Friends and relatives of McCroskey say he'd be appalled .
" They 've basically used it as a cash cow , " said Bob McCroskey , a cousin to the late land donor .
" They just waited till he died . "
Like McCroskey , many donors nationwide have given land to local scout councils , thinking they'd be preserved or used by boys for outdoor activities .
While some gave properties with little more than a handshake , others wrote deed restrictions meant to require councils to conserve the land .
But a Hearst Newspapers investigation found that in dozens of cases , scouting councils have logged or sold such donated properties , sometimes going to court to overturn deed restrictions that might otherwise have interfered , records show .
Such actions have sparked several lawsuits and public outrage in Washington , New York , Texas , Florida , Ohio and other states .
" This has happened in too many places for it to be a random thing , " said Anne Miller , who sued an Arizona scout council to block developers from acquiring land her father donated to the scouts for a camp .
Scouting officials say that as private nonprofits , local councils manage their own lands .
Officials say they do n't want to log or sell donated properties , but sometimes have no other option .
Donated land may not be properly zoned , they say .
It may pose security risks or simply not be suited for camping , they say .
Other land gifts that once served well as camps may have become too costly to maintain or have fallen out of use due to encroaching development or scouting demographics shifts , they say .
" Society at the time that many of these donations were made was so different than it is today , " said Doug Dillow , North New Jersey Council executive .
But critics say scouting officials too often sell off donated lands when seeking to pay other expenses .
That 's a slap in the face to donors , they say .
Bequests and clear - cuts
When their local scout council began clear - cutting Camp Lowman near Athens , Ohio , in 2000 , 8 - year - old Cub Scout Jeb Branner and his father , John , sued .
Businessman Willard Lowman had donated the land in 1948 for a camp .
Officials for the Allohak Council planned to spend most of $ 40,000 in expected logging proceeds for a new dining hall at another camp .
The Branners won an injunction to stop the logging , and after Lowman 's son came forward to testify to his late father 's wishes , the council agreed to preserve the camp , John Branner said .
" It 's a nice camp with a lot of virgin timber that makes for a nice Boy Scouts retreat , " said David Lowman , the donor 's son .
" That 's what ( my dad ) wanted . "
The council executive at the time of the controversy did not return phone calls seeking comment .
In Texas , the Three Rivers Council convinced the nonprofit Stark Foundation to waive deed restrictions in 2001 to allow the sale of Camp Bill Stark , a 132 - acre pine woodland near Beaumont .
Lutcher Stark had donated the land some 70 years earlier , specifying it be used for a camp .
Scouting officials said they could n't afford to maintain it , and promised to use sale proceeds to improve another camp .
But once released from the deed restriction , they sold the land to an investment firm , and most of it was immediately clear - cut .
Foundation Chairman Walter Riedel III , an Eagle Scout , said scout leaders assured foundation officials that part of the woodland would be preserved as a camp .
" Being a scout - I expected them to do the right thing and be honest with us and I 'm not real sure that happened , " Riedel said .
Former executive Jack Crawford , who no longer works for the scouts , declined comment .
Some critics contend the scouts specifically look for ways to profit off land gifts .
John Shontz , a lawyer in Helena , Mont. , said an aging doctor hired him several years ago to help bequeath 1,500 unspoiled acres on the Missouri River to the Montana Council .
But council officials brought in a regional director and a lawyer who refused to agree that the land could only be used for recreation .
That nixed the deal .
" It was obvious to both me and my client ... they wanted to turn around and log , develop or sell it to make a huge profit , " Shontz said .
Retired scouting executive Norman Stone said the dynamic nature of land requires councils to avoid taking gifts with strings .
" I do n't know any organization that will say , ' Restrict me for life on this as a camping property , ' because at some point , it may be unsuitable for camping , " he said .
" You have to be able to divest property that no longer fits your objectives . "
' Recreational purposes '
McCroskey was a dedicated outdoorsman of the 1940s and 1950s who donated the land for two state parks , including Mary Minerva McCroskey State Park in Idaho , which he named for his mother .
Next to McCroskey Park , he set aside land for a scout camp , working for years with boys and volunteers to cut trails , install a well water system and build basic shelters .
Few structures have survived the high - impact logging at the camp .
In 1974 , two years after McCroskey died , the Spokane council sold timber on the camp for $ 675,000 to the Potlatch Corp. , records show .
The ensuing clear - cut harvested about 3 million board feet of timber .
" Virgil would be turning over in his grave if he knew about it , " said Lee Sahlin , a former scout leader whose wife is related to McCroskey .
The council has logged parts of the camp at least three more times since 1996 .
Tim McCandless , the council 's current executive , said recent logging has been responsibly done under a long - term management plan .
Because it 's land - locked with steep terrain , the camp " is n't as desirable for camping " as the council 's three other camps , he added .
Any logging revenue goes into an endowment that pays for other camps ' upkeep , McCandless said .
" So I would argue that Camp McCroskey , indeed , is being used for ' recreational purposes ' as the deed states . "
We ’ve all been there : it ’s a beautiful day and you ca n’t bear the thought of going into work .
So you call in with the lame - old excuse about feeling ill even though you know your boss does n’t buy it .
Besides , “ feeling ill ” is at best only a short - term solution that wo n’t win you any fans at the office .
That ’s why if you ’re going to play hooky , you need an excuse that will help you save face as well as your sanity .
Here are some ideas .
1. ( For women ) “ I have really bad cramps . ”
Now before you dismiss this one , think about it :
Who can argue ?
It ’s such an embarrassing topic that nobody will ever challenge you .
It ’s one of those things that men honestly have no clue about and women can sympathize with .
2. ( For men ) “ I have horrible diarrhea . ”
Again , before you dismiss this one , remember that it ’s such an embarrassing topic — especially for a man — nobody will doubt your sincerity .
Plus , it ’s simple .
You do n’t need an elaborate back story because no one wants to hear the details .
If anything , your boss and co-workers will admire you for your honesty .
3 . “ I ’m having an allergic reaction to _______ , and I need a day to recover . ”
This excuse requires a few details about when and where it happened as well as the details of your food allergy , but Google should give you everything you need .
The upside of this excuse is that you can use it more than once .
The downside is that it requires a good memory and some vigilance : for instance , you ca n’t claim a peanut allergy and then gorge yourself on Thai food at the next company junket .
4 . “ My grandmother ’s / grandfather ’s memorial service is today . ”
This excuse works for two reasons : first , because elderly people die everyday no one is going to think your excuse is unlikely ; second , no one is going to question ( or resent ) a death in your family for fear of offending you .
If you play your cards right , this excuse is good for four free days — one for each grandparent — with each new job .
5 . “ My wife / husband is extremely ill and I need to stay home and take care of them . ”
The excuse is a gem not only because you get a day off , but also because it makes you seem sensitive .
The only drawback is that it requires an accomplice — namely , your spouse .
As such , you may want to save this excuse for a special occasion when the two of you can organize a special three - day weekend .
6 . “ One of my children got in trouble at school .
I need to go meet with his / her teacher and the school counselor . ”
This is only one of a multitude of excuses you can use with mischievous children .
Just recycle the same formula — child gets in trouble , child needs help , parent to the rescue .
This works with children of all ages , from children traumatized by irresponsible day - care workers to playground fights to errant teenagers .
( Hey , this is one of the perks of having kids — they torment us 364 days of the year and we get 1 day off .
Fair trade . )
7 . “ I took some work home last night and will be going through it today from home . ”
Whoever invented telecommuting should be sainted .
Just remember that in order to sell the “ working from home ” excuse you need to email or call the office a couple times throughout the day to maintain the ruse that you ’re working .
The best time to do this is at lunch — that way you get credit for the call but you do n’t have to answer too many questions .
8. “ I have a doctor ’s appointment . ”
At the very least , this excuse is good for a half - day ; however , you can get a full day depending on how you plan it .
Remember that people are nosy and they will probably toss - out some open - ended questions about how you ’re feeling when you get back .
The key is to be vague on the details .
Visits to the doctor are much more effective if shrouded in mystery , which allows you maximum flexibility if you need to use the excuse again .
9 . “ I got pulled over for speeding on my way to work the other day and I have to go to traffic school . ”
The idea here is that you had minor trouble with the law ( emphasis on minor ) and you have to pay your dues .
A variation on this would be letting your license expire — or at least claiming it did — which means you had to go to the DMV and take a written test as well as a driving test , which could easily take a full day .
After all , the DMV has its reputation for a reason .
And finally â€ ¦
10 . “ My accountant made some clerical errors on my taxes and I ’m being audited . ”
In the wake of the Enron scandal and the demise of Arthur Andersen , this excuse is a sure - thing .
The important thing is to make the accountant look like the bad guy — you just need to be there to make sure he does n’t do anything shady .
Once again , the key to this excuse is to make everyone feel sorry for you , not envy you .
What are your best excuses for getting out of work ?
Better yet , what are some of your worst excuses ?

HONG KONG  Rio Tinto , the mining company , said on Wednesday that it would cut 14,000 jobs and sharply reduce spending as demand for raw materials slows .
The company cited the “ unprecedented rapidity and severity of the global economic downturn , ” and said it was shedding 14,000 jobs , 8,500 of them contract positions .
It will also cut capital expenditures next year by more than half .
It said the measures would help to reduce operating costs by $ 2.5 billion a year by 2010 .
Rio Tinto has a work force of 112,000 .
The announcement came just weeks after BHP Billiton , the world ’s biggest mining company , walked away from a long battle to acquire Rio Tinto .
BHP , faced with demands by European regulators that it sell significant assets to secure approval , abandoned the hostile $ 66 billion bid on Nov. 25 , saying the turmoil in the financial markets and declining commodity prices made the transaction too risky .
Luc Pez , an analyst who covers metals and miners at Oddo & Compagnie in Paris , said the Rio Tinto announcement was “ not very surprising , given the focus on reducing debt after BHP abandoned its offer . ”
For the most part , we never notice the “ visual weight ” of a site .
That ’s a good thing .
Experienced front - end developers optimize their site to load quickly and display accurately across all modern browsers .
In this post , I will detail how to analyze the bottlenecks preventing websites and blogs from loading quickly and how to resolve them .
Backstory : They Grow So Quickly
Back when we launched UX Booth , I did n’t pay any mind to the “ weight ” of our site .
It was n’t until a couple of our readers commented about the load times on our site that we decided to take a look .
It was quite the eye - opener .
Unfortunately , we committed a user - experience sin right there : waiting until you get negative feedback to improve the experience .
But we had never noticed the load times ourselves ; probably because we had built the site .
It ’s like watching a child - grow up– –you can’t tell how much they ’ve changed in a year , but their distant relatives can .
One night with a bit too much time , I did some research into the weight of our own site .
Like most , I consulted Google when looking for answers on the subject .
Ironically , I found a whole bunch of good advice from Yahoo !.
Step One : Assess the weight of your site
There are many ways to approach this problem .
As I said , Yahoo ! has detailed plenty of methods for speeding up your site , and numerous other people have had their say .
Who do we listen to ?
Everyone — just in small amounts .
I decided to look at our site as a generic WordPress blog , and optimize it by that standard .
In this way , I believe the approach is applicable to any blog , and to many other sites as well .
If you ’re interested in a more thorough approach to this subject , I suggest you take a look at Yahoo ! ’s book on the subject : High Performance Web Sites : Essential Knowledge for Front - End Engineers .
Use “ YSlow ” To Find Performance Issues
In assessing the weight of our site there were a number of things I did .
First , I grabbed a copy of YSlow .
YSlow is a tool for front - end engineers that analyzes web pages and tells you why they ’re slow .
This analysis is based on the rules for high performance web sites found on Yahoo ! ’s developer network .
Most of these rules are commonsensical , whereas some apply only to websites that receive millions of unique visitors a day .
Indeed , Jeff Atwood of codinghorror.com advises against optimizing your site strictly against these rules .
Nonetheless , we will run our site by YSlow to get an idea where our problem areas lie .
Setting up YSlow is a breeze .
From the Firefox browser , simply select Tools > Add Ons , and type in YSlow .
Follow the instructions presented thereafter .
To use YSlow , browse to a page you would like to grade and select the YSlow icon ( the “ speedometer ” icon ) from the bottom of your browser window .
Running YSlow on http : made the problem a bit more obvious :
Not only did we have a performance grade of 31 , our page load size was at a bloated 1320.5 k .
Wow !
Where is all that weight coming from ?
To get an idea , I checked the size of the image , stylesheet , and javascript folders for our site .
Keep in mind : any bytes that are being sent to the client will create a lag in the display on the page .
Pingdom ’s Full Page Test
Another good tool to see how your browser is downloading content from your webpage is Pingdom ’s Full Page Test .
The benefit here is that you do n’t have to use Firefox ( not that Firefox is a bad thing ) , and the results are much easier to parse .
The graphs do n’t look good .
We ’ve got a page - load time at or around 9 seconds .
I ’m certain we can reduce it , but the engineer in me says that we need to do this strategically .
To understand what ’s keeping your users from seeing the content when they land on your site , we ’ll need a little information about how browsers display content .
How does a browser render my site ?
Modern browsers make use of a Layout Engine or rendering engine , to display content .
A layout engine , or rendering engine , is software that takes marked up content ( such as HTML , XML , image files , etc. ) and formatting information ( such as CSS , XSL , etc. ) and displays the formatted content on the screen .
It “ paints ” on the content area of a window , which is displayed on a monitor or a printer .
A layout engine is typically used for web browsers , e-mail clients , or other applications that require the displaying ( and editing ) of web contents .
Wikipedia.org
To render the contents of your website , your browser must do a number of things : first , the browser must download the content to display ; second , the browser must appropriately style the content to display ; third , the browser is responsible for interpreting any browser - side scripts ( Javascript / Flash ) that are transferred with the content ; fourth , the browser paints , or renders , the display of the content .
Most of the time , this process occurs in this order .
1. Download the Content
Here ’s an interesting fact :
80 % of the end - user response time is spent on the front - end .
Most of this time is tied up in downloading all the components in the page : images , stylesheets , scripts , Flash , etc .
Reducing the number of components in turn reduces the number of HTTP requests required to render the page .
This is the key to faster pages .
http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#num_http
Many people do n’t take this into account when they think of optimizing a site .
The “ backend ” ( or server - side ) code only accounts for about 20 % of the response time of a web application .
This means that the real meat of the problem begins with the browser , and the first thing a browser does is download all the content ( and related assets ) it needs to display to the user .
That makes sense — the browser has to get the content from our server , so what can we do to help it along ?
The answer is pretty easy : simplify what it has to retrieve .
If a browser - agent only has to download 250 kb as opposed to 500 kb , that ’s a plus .
Further , if a browser only has to download one 250 kb file as opposed to two 125 kb files , that ’s another plus .
Why ?
Because initiating a connection to your server takes time .
Yes , that ’s right : every new connection to your server ( they happen in parallel ) takes time , just to create the connection path .
So , to this point , we ’re going to reduce not only the size of the content , but how we deliver it to the user .
That means reducing the size of our assets ( images , stylesheets , javascript ) , and reducing the number of our assets .
2. Style the Content
Nothing too exciting here .
Browsers take our stylesheets and interpret them .
With that said , let ’s try and make our stylesheets as lightweight as possible .
If you ’re like me , you use an IDE like MacRabbit ’s CSSEdit to make sense of the styles you ’re applying to your site .
Make sure to not repeat code .
If you ’ve got segments of code that read :
p.notice{ font - weight : bold ; font - size : 1.33em ; } p.another - notice { font - weight : bold ; font - size : 1.33em }
… replace them with :
p.notice , p.another - notice{ font - weight : bold ; font - size : 1.33em ; }
Not only will your end - users relish in the faster load - time of your site , you will show your colleagues just how much of a CSS Jedi you really are .
3 . Run browser - side scripts
Browser - side scripting languages include things like Javascript and Flash .
Each of these scripts must be interpreted by the user ’s browser and the results of the script are then injected back into the document .
In some cases , the scripts that the browser must interpret take so long to compute that the browser will “ jump ” while loading them .
This does n’t make for the most aesthetically pleasing load .
For the most part , try and use javascript that is only “ run ” on a certain event that the user initiates ( say , a mouse click ) to avoid a jumpy load .
Even in the event that your script is small and depends on the user to call it to action , make sure that it is parsed last .
To do this , Yahoo !
recommends that you place javascript at the bottom of your page .
The problem caused by scripts is that they block parallel downloads .
The HTTP / 1.1 specification suggests that browsers download no more than two components in parallel per hostname .
If you serve your images from multiple hostnames , you can get more than two downloads to occur in parallel .
While a script is downloading , however , the browser wo n’t start any other downloads , even on different hostnames .

4. Render the content
As front - end developers , we have very little control over what browsers our users use to access our site .
Some users will use Safari , while others may prefer Internet Explorer 6 ( say it ai n’t so ) .
While we do n’t have control over this aspect , we can code sites that work well regardless of the browser - agent .
Make sure to minimize your use of CSS expressions targeted at the Internet Explorer browser , for example .
Step Two : Minimize your Visual weight
– Now that we know how a browser is retrieving and displaying our data we can optimize our blog to facilitate this process .
The best way to reduce the visual weight of the site is to reduce the complexity of the graphics displayed on your site .
Does your site employ multiple transparencies or image - substituted text ?
If so — do n’t despair , UX Booth presently does both of these — there are still a number of ways to reduce the download footprint of these elements .
Here , I will detail two ways I approached this problem :
1. Save “ solitary ” images as sprites
CSS Sprites have been around for quite awhile .
Looking at A List Apart , I found an article dating as far back as 2004 .
I suggest you read up .
The idea is simple : for images of similar size ( generally not used in a repeating fashion ) , you can minimize the overhead associated with requesting those graphics from your server by saving them together , as one file .
How do we do this ?
Say that you have a simple icon-list , marked up as so :
< ul class= " icon - list " > < li >< a class= " account " href= " / account " >
Account</a></li> < li >< a class = " help " >
Help </a></li> < li >< a class = " home " >
Home</a></li> </ul >
… and you add icons using the following CSS :
ul.icon - list li a {background : none no-repeat left center} ul.icon - list li a.account { background-image:url ( '../images/account.gif') } ul.icon-list li a.account:hover { background-image:url ( '../images/account-hover.gif') } ul.icon- list li a.help { background - image:url ( '../images/help.gif') } ul.icon - list li a.help : hover { background - image:url ( '../images/help-hover.gif ' ) } ...
It might look something like :
Now , taking these icons and “ stacking them ” we generate a sprite .
We then use CSS to change the background position of our links .
All of the links will use the same background image , but they will only show part of it , depending on which link it is .
Our new CSS looks like :
ul#icon - list li a { background:url ( '../images/sprite.gif ' ) no -repeat left center ; height : 32 px ; } ul#icon - list li a.account { background - position : 0 0 ;} ul#icon - list li a.account : hover { background - position : 0 - 32 px ; } ul#icon - list li a.help {background - position : 0 - 64 px ; } ul#icon - list li a.help : hover { background - position : 0 - 96 p x ; } ...
Here ’s what this css is doing .
The background - position defines where the anchor should look in the sprite .gif file for it ’s starting point .
That way , we simply define many starting points ( at 32px increments ) for our items in one image .
The results speak for themselves :
For more information , check CSS Tricks , and look to Website Performance ’s CSS Sprite generator if you need help generating the sprites and styles .
2. Optimize graphics for the web
In general , there ’s only one format any given image is destined for .
If you need transparency in an image , you ’re probably going to reach for a PNG .
On the other hand , if you ’ve got an image of reasonable size you ’re probably going to save it as a JPG .
Somewhere in the middle , there ’s a place with .GIF files win out .
To save an image for the web from photoshop , go to File > Save for Web .
If you select the JPG format , you ’ll be presented with the “ before and after ” of your image .
When an image is saved for the web it is profiled for the sRGB color space and generally run through a compression algorithm .
I would recommend setting your “ quality ” drop - down at or around 70 % .
That generally makes for the least amount of jpg artifacts coupled with the smallest file size .
Learn more about optimizing images with Photoshop , and how it can speed up your user experience .
Lastly , I wanted to chime in on a tool I just found : http://smush.it/.
This site offers a service that will go through your images and optimize them .
They claim to do so in a way that does n’t degrade the quality of your images .
So I suggest that after you save your images for the web , you batch - upload them to Smush .
it and see how much space they can save you .
If you find yourself using them all the time , they even have a Firefox plugin and a bookmarklet for those late - night compression runs .
One more thing : I just found out that smush .
it offers a wordpress plugin that will optimize your future uploaded images .
Check out the smush .
it plugin for wordpress .
Step Three :
Let the page ’s content load first
By placing your css links in your header , ( you are using external stylesheets , right ? ) you allow the browser to get to work styling the content as it parses the page .
This means that your users see properly - formatted content as they load the page .
Next , place your javascript links “ in the footer ” of your page&mdashl that is , towards the end .
This means that your users can get on their way reading and navigating through your content while your scripts load in the meantime .
Step Four : GZIP & Minimize your assets
This one ’s a biggie .
Perhaps you have seen “ minimized ” versions of javascript libraries .
If you ’ve ever downloaded one and tried to sift through it , you probably drew back in horror .
No worries , your users will should never see your javascript source code…unless they ’re developers .
While it does n’t make much sense to develop with minified libraries , consider deploying your blog with a minimized versin of your scripts .
If you ’re like me , you do n’t really like having two versions of the jQuery libraries to deal with .
For that matter , you probably do n’t want to have to manually “ minimize ” your javascript and CSS files before you place them on your server .
It could get tedious very quickly !
That ’s where WordPress plugins come to the rescue .
To minimize and GZip our blog assets , I used the following plugins :
Click the links above to download and then follow the instructions below to employ them .
1. Install & activate the plugins
If you ’re using wordpress 2.6 , installing plugins is trivially simple .
Simply type the names of the above plugins in ( WP JS , WP CSS , GZippy ) and click install .
Next , visit your plugins page , select these plugins , and click activate .
Easy .
Note that if you ’re only using GZippy , you can stop here .
Yeah , it does n’t have a configuration panel or anything , it just works behind the scenes .
2 . Move images used by your stylesheets
By convention , themes are broken up into specific folders .
Some of these include / images , stylesheets / , and javascripts /.
WP CSS depends on this convention .
If you ’re like me , you code your stylesheets in a manner that does n’t depend on a folder “ outside ” of the stylesheets folder .
For example , before using this plugin , I had images used by the UX Booth stylesheets in / stylesheets / images .
This plugin depends on having images in the / images folder .
The difference is important if you ’re using this plugin .
Fortunately , this is an easy change to make .
But you should be aware of this dependancy before you install the plugin .
( More adventurous users could hack the plugins source code to fix this if they felt the need . )
3 . Enable permissions on the cache folder
Each of Halmat ’s plugins require you to change the permissions on the cache / folder inside of the plugin .
So navigate to wp - content / plugins / wp-css / cache and issue a chmod 777 ( read , write , execute for all users ) .
Do the same for wp - content / plugins / wp - js / cache .
4 . Wire your scripts into the plugins
Whereas before you might have numerous external links in your header :
< link rel=" stylesheet " href = " http:/wordpress/wp-content/themes/UXBooth/stylesheets/master.css " type =" text /css " media= " screen " charset = " utf - 8 " /> < link rel=" stylesheet " href = " http:/wordpress/wp-content/themes/UXBooth/stylesheets/master2.css " type =" text /css " media= " screen " charset = " utf - 8 " />
… you will use :
< link rel=" stylesheet " href= " <? php bloginfo( ' stylesheets/master.css ' , ' stylesheets/master2.css ' ) ; ? > " type =" text /css " media= " screen " />
In a similar fashion , in “ footer ” of our document we replaced
< script src= " http:/wordpress/wp-content/themes/UXBooth/javascripts/syntax_highlighter/shCore.js " type =" text / javascript " ></ script >
… with something like
< script src= " <? php wp_js ( ' javascripts/jquery -1.3.1.min.js , javascripts/facebox.js , javascripts/application.js , javascripts/syntax_highlighter/shCore.js ' ) ? > " type =" text / javascript " charset= " utf -8 " ></ script >
For more detailed instructions , consult the author ’s documentation .
The Results
The numbers show the results .
To give you an idea of how much we were able to improve our own blog with these techniques : Before , UXBooth had a footprint of 1350 kb , and afterwards our page size has dropped to about 450 kb .
That ’s nothing compared to Yahoo ! ’s numbers , but it ’s a great start .
I encourage front - end developers to design their sites from the group up using techniques like CSS - sprites and GZip compression .
I ’ve learned the hard way .
While I ’ve been doing development for years , and I ’ve come across sprites and compression before , I never realized what a difference it could make .
Now that I know , I ’ll always optimize before the complaints roll in .

An article on the psychological characteristic of vicious dog owners has just appeared online in the compelling academic publication , The Journal of Forensic Sciences , finding that those who who own dangerous dogs are more likely to endorse antisocial and psychopathic character traits and more likely to report criminal behaviour .
The study was led by psychologist Laurie Ragatz who collected data from 869 college students who completed an anonymous online questionnaire assessing type of dog owned , criminal behaviors , attitudes towards animal abuse , psychopathy , and personality .
It ’s only a correlational study but the introduction has a nice summary of the research findings as well as a previous study on the same topic :
Each year , 4.7 million people are bitten by dogs , of which 386,000 are seriously injured and over 200 die .
Several dog breeds have been labeled “ vicious ” or of “ high - risk ” for aggression .
To date , only one empirical study has examined the characteristics of persons who choose to own their high - risk dogs .
Barnes et al. reports that owners of Akitas , Chow - Chows , Dobermans , Pit Bulls , Rottweilers , and Wolf - mixes endorsed approximately 10 times more criminal convictions than owners of nonvicious dogs .
Further , vicious dog owners reported more crimes involving aggression , children , alcohol , and domestic violence than owners of nonvicious dogs .
The current research sought to replicate and extend these findings with a college sample .
The present study compared nondog owners and owners of vicious , large , and small dogs on engagement in criminal behavior , general personality traits ( i.e. , impulsive sensation seeking , neuroticism - anxiety , aggression - hostility , activity , and sociability ) , psychopathy , and attitude towards animal maltreatment .
… As hypothesized , a significant difference in criminal behavior was found based on dog ownership type .
Owners of vicious dogs were significantly more likely to admit to violent criminal behavior , compared to large dog owners , small dog owners , and controls .
The vicious dog owner sample also engaged in more types ( i.e. , violent , property , drug , and status ) of criminal behavior compared to all other participant groups .
Personality traits were examined and vicious dog owners were significantly higher than controls on impulsive sensation seeking .
Examining psychopathic traits , owners of high - risk dogs endorsed significantly more characteristics of primary psychopathy ( e.g. , carelessness , selfishness , and manipulative tendencies ) than small dog owners .
Comparing owners of vicious dogs to other groups , no significant differences were found regarding secondary psychopathy ( e.g. , impulsiveness or self - defeating behaviors ) or attitudes towards animal maltreatment .
Among the college sample , the vicious dogs were predominantly male and weighed 68 pounds .
The owners had more self - reported overall criminal behaviors as well as violent criminal behavior .
They endorsed significantly more sensation seeking and primary psychopathic traits .

This year , the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association will focus on the return of Jesus Christ and help prepare believers for life in the last days , according to a recent announcement .
" People ask me , ' Do you really believe that Jesus Christ is going to come back to this earth again ? ' " writes the Rev. Billy Graham in one of the several resources that the ministry is providing on the End Times .
" Yes , I do , " he continues .
" The Bible teaches that Jesus is coming again .
And I do n't see any other hope , because we 're heading toward a catastrophe in our world . "
As part of its effort , the ministry has compiled a number of End Times resources including a message delivered by Graham in 1998 , a 2008 message from BGEA president and CEO Franklin Graham , an article adapted from a message delivered by Anne Graham Lotz in 1996 , an End Times article on the basics of the Second Coming , and a couple of Q& As with Billy Graham that includes a question on whether the world will end in 2009 .
" The most important question , however , is this : Are you ready for Christ 's return ? "
Graham writes after offering his response .
The BGEA is hoping that through its compilation of resources on the Second Coming of Christ , believers will learn how they can fulfill God 's plan for their life , increase their love for the Savior and grow their faith during these times - as if it were their last days .
" If that happens today , are you ready ? " Graham poses .
The world renowned evangelist also reminds believers that regardless of when Christ returns , the end of the world does come for each and every single person – the moment that they die .

" [ A ] nd that could be at any time for any of us .
We never know , " Graham states .
" What have you done to prepare for that moment when your heart stops beating ? "
The latest effort by the BGEA comes just a few months after Graham celebrated his 90th birthday and ahead of the 100th birthday celebration of George Beverly Shea , who for decades was the musical mainstay at Graham 's evangelistic crusades .
It also comes one year before the ministry marks its 60th anniversary .

Annie Lu , 30 , a nurse practitioner , said she called about refinancing when she heard that the economy was officially in a recession .
She and her husband bought their house in Brooklyn about three years ago with a mortgage rate of 6.25 percent .
She is hoping to qualify for a rate almost a percentage point lower .
“ It is good to prepare for the worst , and nobody minds saving as much as we can , ” she said .
The Treasury ’s consideration of additional efforts to breathe life into the housing market was first reported on The Wall Street Journal ’s Web site .
People familiar with the Treasury ’s plans said that Treasury officials had met with top executives at Fannie and Freddie last week but that neither had been notified that any steps were taken toward putting such a plan into effect .
By one account , the new program would be available only to home buyers , not to people who simply want to refinance their existing loan at a lower rate .
But those looking to refinance are already eyeing the lower rates .
“ Borrowers with reasonably good credit and a home that has n’t lost too much value are going to find mortgage money plentiful and readily available , ” said Brad Blackwell , national sales manager at Wells Fargo Home Mortgage .
As rates drop , more people , in theory , qualify for loans because their monthly principal and interest payments will be lower .
But to qualify for the best rates , borrowers need to have impeccable credit — or a credit score of 720 or higher — as well as at least 10 to 20 percent of equity in their homes .
And while experts said they were heartened by the pickup in activity , the overall number of refinancings this year was expected to be only slightly more than a quarter of the volume at the height of the housing boom in 2003 .
Image The Lattanzios are not alone in seeing an opportunity : one index of refinancing activity tripled last week .

“ It is not going to spike up rapidly or anywhere near as it has in the past because credit is still tight , the economy is still weak and there are fewer people that could refinance now than could before , ” said Celia Chen , senior director of housing economics at Moody ’s Economy.com .
“ But the decline in rates will help those that can . ”
Steinbrück und die Eidgenossen Angriff aufs Schweizer Herz
Schweizer und Deutsche sprechen die gleiche Sprache , doch sie verstehen sich nicht .
Wie fremd sich die beiden Länder sind , zeigt Peer Steinbrücks Indianer - Vergleich - und die aggressiven Reaktionen der Eidgenossen .
In his first televised speech before Congress , President Obama asserted that prosperity will return once the government restores the flow of credit in the economy .
It may come as a surprise to him , but an economy can not run on consumer loans .
Furthermore , credit stopped flowing in the U.S. for a very good reason : there was no more savings left to loan .
Government efforts to simply make credit available , without rebuilding productive capacity or increasing savings , are doomed to destroy whats left of our economy .
The central tenets of Obamanomics appear to be that access to credit will enable people to borrow money to buy stuff , the spending will spur production and employment , and thus the economy will grow .
It s a neat and simple picture , but it has nothing whatsoever to do with how an economy works .
The President does not understand that consumption is made possible by production and that credit is made possible by savings .
The size and complexity of modern economies has obscured these simple concepts , but reducing the picture to a small scale can help clear away the fog .
Suppose there is a very small barter - based economy consisting of only three individuals , a butcher , a baker , and a candlestick maker .
If the candlestick maker wants bread or steak , he makes candles and trades .
The candlestick maker always wants food , but his demand can only be satisfied if he makes candles , without which he goes hungry .
The mere fact that he desires bread and steak is meaningless .
Enter the magic wand of credit , which many now assume can take the place of production .
Suppose the butcher has managed to produce an excess amount of steak and has more than he needs on a daily basis .
Knowing this , the candlestick maker asks to borrow a steak from the butcher to trade to the baker for bread .
For this transaction to take place the butcher must first have produced steaks which he did not consume ( savings ) .
He then loans his savings to the candlestick maker , who issues the butcher a note promising to repay his debt in candlesticks .
In this instance , it was the butchers production of steak that enabled the candlestick maker to buy bread , which also had to be produced .
The fact that the candlestick maker had access to credit did not increase demand or bolster the economy .
In fact , by using credit to buy instead of candles , the economy now has fewer candles , and the butcher now has fewer steaks with which to buy bread himself .
What has happened is that through savings , the butcher has loaned his purchasing power , created by his production , to the candlestick maker , who used it to buy bread .
Similarly , the candlestick maker could have offered IOU candlesticks  directly to the baker .
Again , the transaction could only be successful if the baker actually baked bread that he did not consume himself and was therefore able to loan his savings to the candlestick maker .
Since he loaned his bread to the candlestick maker , he no longer has that bread himself to trade for steak .
The existence of credit in no way increases aggregate consumption within this community , it merely temporarily alters the way consumption is distributed .
The only way for aggregate consumption to increase is for the production of candlesticks , steak , and bread to increase .
One way credit could be used to grow this economy would be for the candlestick maker to borrow bread and steak for sustenance while he improves the productive capacity of his candlestick - making equipment .
If successful , he could repay his loans with interest out of his increased production , and all would benefit from greater productivity .
In this case the under - consumption of the butcher and baker led to the accumulation of savings , which were then loaned to the candlestick maker to finance capital investments .
Had the butcher and baker consumed all their production , no savings would have been accumulated , and no credit would have been available to the candlestick maker , depriving society of the increased productivity that would have followed .
On the other hand , had the candlestick maker merely borrowed bread and steak to sustain himself while taking a vacation from candlestick making , society would gain nothing , and there would be a good chance the candlestick maker would default on the loan .
In this case , the extension of consumer credit squanders savings which are now no longer available to finance other capital investments .
What would happen if a natural disaster destroyed all the equipment used to make candlesticks , bread and steak ?
Confronted with dangerous shortages of food and lighting , Barack Obama would offer to stimulate the economy by handing out pieces of paper called money and guaranteeing loans to whomever wants to consume .
What good would the money do ?
Would these pieces of paper or loans make goods magically appear ?
The mere introduction of paper money into this economy only increases the ability of the butcher , baker , and candlestick maker to bid up prices ( measured in money , not trade goods ) once goods are actually produced again .
The only way to restore actual prosperity is to repair the destroyed equipment and start producing again .
The sad truth is that the productive capacity of the American economy is now largely in tatters .
Our industrial economy has been replaced by a reliance on health care , financial services and government spending .
Introducing freer - flowing credit and more printed money into such a system will do nothing except spark inflation .
We need to get back to the basics of production .
It wont be easy , but it will work .
President Obama would have us believe that we can all spend the day relaxing in a tub while his printing press does all the work for us .
The problem comes when you get out of the tub to go to dinner and the only thing on your plate is an IOU for steak .

The Best of Peter Schiff
A coalition of Sea Shepherd and Jakarta Animal Aid is ratcheting the pressure on Japanese whalers .
Fleeing the Sea Shepherd ship the Steve Irwin on December 20 , the harpoon vessel Yushin Maru 2 suffered heavy damage from ice floes in the Southern Ocean and was forced to limp north to Surabaya , Indonesia , for repairs ( amid much cheering from the Sea Shepherd activists , I ’m guessing ) .
“ They only had two choices , ” says Captain Paul Watson of Sea Shepherd .
“ They could have gone south with the Steve Irwin into the lighter ice or they could have gone north to avoid the Steve Irwin into the thicker ice floes .
They chose the more dangerous route and it looks like they suffered damage for that decision . ”
The whalers had to retreat to Indonesia because their illegal whaling activities have gotten them barred from the much - closer Australian and New Zealand ports .
But the Japanese crews ’ woes have n’t ended .
The Jakarta Animal Aid organization has been demonstrating in Surabaya , Indonesia ’s second - largest city , protesting the presence of the Yushin Maru 2 . Jakarta Animal Aid activists are also organizing another protest at the Japanese embassy .
The Yushin Maru 2 is expected to leave Suryabaya on January 16 , the day the Steve Irwin will likely arrive in Hobart , Tasmania , for refueling .
Once refueled , the Steve Irwin will be able to return to the Japanese whaling fleet in the Southern Ocean before the Yushin Maru 2 .
Other vessels in the fleet include the Kaiko Maru , the Nisshin Maru and the Yushin Maru 3 .
The crews of the whaling vessels have gone to considerable trouble and expense to outfit their ships with anti-boarding measures , including spikes and nets around the ships .
“ It really is quite amazing , ” says Captain Watson .
“ The effort and expense that has gone into preventing us from boarding is ambitious .
The ships can literally cover themselves with a net that can be deployed like a shower curtain around the vessel .
Large fenders and sharp spikes protrude from the sides of the ship .
It looks very formidable and very expensive . ”
The Japanese also recently tried to have Australian authorities ban Sea Shepherd from the country ’s ports for refueling the Steve Irwin .
Australia rebuffed the request , and now Sea Shepherd is working to get the Japanese fleet banned from ports in Indonesia because of their illegal whaling activities in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary .
“ We have demonstrated that the whalers can be physically stopped , ” says Captain Watson .
“ If we had just one more ship down here , we could stop them by 90 percent , and we could bankrupt them totally .
Shutting down illegal whaling in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary is a very doable task .
We are doing the best we can with the resources available to us .
With more support we could win this war to save the whales . ”
Sea Shepherd is offering a $ 10,000 reward to anyone able to non-violently prevent the Yushin Maru 2 from departing the harbor for the duration of this year ’s whaling season .
You can bet all this high - seas drama will make for a winning season of Whale Wars .
• Scientists say 4C rise would kill 85 % of the Amazon rainforest •
Even modest temperature rise would see 20 - 40 % loss within 100 years
Global warming will wreck attempts to save the Amazon rainforest , according to a devastating new study which predicts that one - third of its trees will be killed by even modest temperature rises .
The research , by some of Britain 's leading experts on climate change , shows that even severe cuts in deforestation and carbon emissions will fail to save the emblematic South American jungle , the destruction of which has become a powerful symbol of human impact on the planet .
Up to 85 % of the forest could be lost if spiralling greenhouse gas emissions are not brought under control , the experts said .
But even under the most optimistic climate change scenarios , the destruction of large parts of the forest is " irreversible " .
Vicky Pope , of the Met Office 's Hadley Centre , which carried out the study , said : " The impacts of climate change on the Amazon are much worse than we thought .
As temperatures rise quickly over the coming century the damage to the forest wo n't be obvious straight away , but we could be storing up trouble for the future . "
Tim Lenton , a climate expert at the University of East Anglia , called the study , presented at a global warming conference in Copenhagen today , a " bombshell " .
He said : " When I was young I thought chopping down the trees would destroy the forest but now it seems that climate change will deliver the killer blow . "
The study , which has been submitted to the journal Nature Geoscience , used computer models to investigate how the Amazon would respond to future temperature rises .
It found that a 2C rise above pre-industrial levels , widely considered the best case global warming scenario and the target for ambitious international plans to curb emissions , would still see 20 - 40 % of the Amazon die off within 100 years .
A 3C rise would see 75 % of the forest destroyed by drought over the following century , while a 4C rise would kill 85 % .
" The forest as we know it would effectively be gone , " Pope said .
Experts had previously predicted that global warming could cause significant " die- back " of the Amazon .
The new research is the first to quantify the long - term effect .
Chris Jones , who led the research , told the conference : " A temperature rise of anything over 1C commits you to some future loss of Amazon forest .
Even the commonly quoted 2C target already commits us to 20 - 40 % loss .
On any kind of pragmatic timescale , I think we should see loss of the Amazon forest as irreversible . "
Peter Cox , professor of climate system dynamics at the University of Exeter , said the effects would be felt around the world .
" Ecologically it would be a catastrophe and it would be taking a huge chance with our own climate .
The tropics are drivers of the world 's weather systems and killing the Amazon is likely to change them forever .
We do n't know exactly what would happen but we could expect more extreme weather . "
Massive Amazon loss would also amplify global warming " significantly " he said .
" Destroying the Amazon would also turn what is a significant carbon sink into a significant source . "
Jones said the study showed that tree growth in high latitudes , such as Siberia , would increase , but would be unlikely to compensate for the carbon stocks lost from the Amazon .
Even with drastic cuts in emissions in the next decade , scientists say that there will only be around a 50 % chance of keeping global temperatures rises below 2C .
This best - case emissions scenario is based on emissions peaking in 2015 and quickly changing from an increase of 2 - 3 % per year to a decrease of 3 % per year .
For every 10 years this action is delayed , the most likely temperature rise increases by 0.5C .
Environmental campaigners said they were alarmed by the predictions .
" With a rise of over 2C you begin to see a large - scale change to savannah , " said Beatrix Richards , head of forest policy and trade at WWF UK .
" You also lose major ecosystem services , such as keeping carbon levels stable , providing indigenous people with goods and services , and balancing rainfall patterns globally from the US grain belt to as far away as Kazakhstan .
A 4C [ rise ] is a nightmare scenario that would move us into uncharted territory . "
" People have known about the links between climate and forests for some time , but the alarming thing now is the level of certainty because real world observations are feeding into the computer models , " said Tony Juniper , an environmental campaigner and Green party candidate .
" There really is no time for delay .
Governments must cooperate to cut industrial emissions while at the same time halting deforestation , otherwise we 'll have a mass extinction and a global warming catastrophe . "
A separate study from the Met Office shows that , if temperatures do reach 2C , then there is a one - in - three chance they would stay that high for at least 100 years , whatever action was taken on carbon pollution .
The results were announced on the second day of a key climate science meeting in Copenhagen , which is intended to spur politicians into taking action to cut carbon pollution .
It comes ahead of a UN summit in December , also in Copenhagen , where officials will try to agree a new global deal on climate to replace the Kyoto protocol .
The results from the meeting will be published in the summer as a supplement to the 2007 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
Positive feedback
Amazon dieback is one of the key positive feedbacks brought about by global warming .
These are typically runaway processes in which global temperature rises lead to further releases of CO² , which in turn brings about more global warming .
In the Amazon this happens on a more localised scale but the result , increased forest death , also releases carbon into the atmosphere .
Experts predict that higher worldwide temperatures will reduce rainfall in the Amazon region , which will cause widespread local drought .
With less water and tree growth , " homegrown " rainfall produced by the forest will reduce as well , as it depends on water passed into the atmosphere above the forests by the trees .
The cycle continues , with even less rain causing more drought , and so on .
With no water , the root systems collapse and the trees fall over .
The parched forest becomes tinderbox dry and more susceptible to fire , which can spread to destroy the still - healthy patches of forest .
Other positive feedback effects expected by scientists , are releases of carbon stored in frozen arctic ecosystems and an increase in the sun 's energy absorbed by the planet as ice melts .
The Queensland Government has set up a task force to investigate fish abnormalities and deaths in the Noosa River on the Sunshine Coast .
An independent fish expert Dr Matt Landos will join staff from the Department of Primary Industries , the Environmental Protection Agency and Queensland Health in a meeting in Brisbane today .
Locals are concerned that agricultural products are to blame for creating two - headed fish larvae at a fish hatchery in the Noosa River , while others are concerned about a possible cancer cluster forming in the region .
Primary Industries Minister Tim Mulherin says he hopes the investigation will provide some answers .
" That 's why I 've set up this independent task force to ... look at all the issues , including chemical spray - drift , to see what is causing this , " he said .
Dr Landos says the task force should immediately begin safety tests on farm chemicals because there are some that have never been tested for their safety on fish .
He believes some farm chemicals are to blame .
" We 've got to be aware that to date there has been no testing of these chemicals to safety on fish larvae , " he said .
" Right throughout their registration process there is no requirement for testing for safety on fish eggs and larvae , and that 's the precise point we 're seeing on these tiny little fish . "
McCain pleased with Obama Afghan plan
McCain said Obama 's strategy will prevent Afghanistan from becoming a base for terrorists .
" I think the outlines of this proposal are good .
The best way to get out of Afghanistan fast is people to think we 're staying , " McCain said .
He said he knows more troops are required in Afghanistan and that the American people need to be prepared for more causalities there .
" The main thing I would have done in that speech , I 'm sorry to say , is to tell the American people that it 's going to be long and hard and tough , " McCain said .
" We 've got to prepare the American people for a significant expenditure of American blood and treasure . "
He said he defines victory in Afghanistan the same way as he defines it in Iraq , " a place where al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations cannot base attacks on the United States and our allies .
You have a government that functions , " McCain said .
There 's a lot of sound and fury in the debate over mark to market accounting but we 're probably over - estimating it 's impact .
The overwhelming majority of assets held by banks are n't subject to mark to market accounting .
David Reilly at Bloomberg breaks down the numbers and shows that only a minority of the $ 8.46 trillion in assets at financial firms are marked to market under current rules .
Only 29 % of the assets at the 12 largest banks are marked to market .
At General Electric 's financial subsidiary , just 2 % are market to market .
Reilly explains why so much of what the banks hold is n't marked to market , despite the fact that they are producing losses .
What are all those other assets that are n’t marked to market prices ?
Mostly loans -- to homeowners , businesses and consumers .
Loans are held at their original cost , minus a reserve that banks create for potential future losses .
Their value does n’t fall in lockstep with drops in market prices .
Yet these loans still produce losses , thanks to the housing meltdown and recession .
In fact , bank losses on unmarked loans are typically bigger than mark - to - market losses on securities like bonds backed by mortgages .
So before you get too worked up about how mark to market rules are crippling financial firms , keep in mind that we 're only talking about a fraction of the assets .
The most illiquid assets are n't marked to market prices right now .
Much of this debate seems fueled by misinformation about the rules .
CORAL GABLES , FL . ( March 11 , 2009 ) -- Researchers at the University of Miami and at the Universities of Tokyo and Tohoku , Japan , have been able to prove the existence of a " spin battery , " a battery that is " charged " by applying a large magnetic field to nano - magnets in a device called a magnetic tunnel junction ( MTJ ) .
The new technology is a step towards the creation of computer hard drives with no moving parts , which would be much faster , less expensive and use less energy than current ones .
In the future , the new battery could be developed to power cars .
The study will be published in an upcoming issue of Nature and is available in an online advance publication of the journal .
The device created by University of Miami Physicist Stewart E. Barnes , of the College of Arts and Sciences and his collaborators can store energy in magnets rather than through chemical reactions .
Like a winding up toy car , the spin battery is " wound up " by applying a large magnetic field -- no chemistry involved .
The device is potentially better than anything found so far , said Barnes .
" We had anticipated the effect , but the device produced a voltage over a hundred times too big and for tens of minutes , rather than for milliseconds as we had expected , " Barnes said .
" That this was counterintuitive is what lead to our theoretical understanding of what was really going on . "
The secret behind this technology is the use of nano - magnets to induce an electromotive force .
It uses the same principles as those in a conventional battery , except in a more direct fashion .
The energy stored in a battery , be it in an iPod or an electric car , is in the form of chemical energy .
When something is turned " on " there is a chemical reaction which occurs and produces an electric current .
The new technology converts the magnetic energy directly into electrical energy , without a chemical reaction .
The electrical current made in this process is called a spin polarized current and finds use in a new technology called " spintronics . "
The new discovery advances our understanding of the way magnets work and its immediate application is to use the MTJs as electronic elements which work in different ways to conventional transistors .
Although the actual device has a diameter about that of a human hair and cannot even light up an LED ( light - emitting diode - - a light source used as electronic component ) , the energy that might be stored in this way could potentially run a car for miles .
The possibilities are endless , Barnes said .
" There are magnets hidden away in many things , for example there are several in a mobile telephone , many in a car , and they are what keeps your refrigerator closed , " he said .
" There are so many that even a small change in the way we understand of how they work , and which might lead to only a very small improvement in future machines , has a significant financial and energetic impact . "

Faced with a $ 65 million advertising shortfall , the CBC is reaching out to Ottawa for bridge financing , an unprecedented request of a Conservative government that has historically had a cool relationship with the public broadcaster .
" The revenues fell off a cliff .
... I have not seen a slide that precipitous and that deep in my entire life , " Richard Stursberg , executive vice - president for English services , told employees yesterday .
" We have not been able to bail the boat as quickly as the water is coming in over the gunwales . "
The public broadcaster says it has used surpluses from other divisions and money in reserve to narrow the budget shortfall to $ 12 million during the current fiscal year , which ends March 31 , but ad revenues are forecast to continue to plummet in the coming year .
Stursberg , who confirmed the move at the monthly town hall meeting yesterday , conceded he did not know what type of reception he would receive from the Conservatives , who , while in opposition , were often overtly hostile to the CBC .
" We do n't know how receptive the government will be to the request , " he said .
A spokesperson for Heritage Minister James Moore said he was already in discussions with the CBC and indicated the door was open to help the corporation .
" In these difficult economic times all broadcasters , including the CBC , are facing challenges , and he is open to working with everyone in a way that will serve all Canadians , " Deirdre McCracken told the Star .
Stursberg did not specify the amount of the bridge loan the CBC is seeking from the government or from a private bank .
" The money ... is not a handout .
...
It would be paid back , " he said .
Advertising revenues in the corporation 's English - language TV operations went into decline last summer .
Canada 's private TV networks , CTV and Canwest Global , are also in crisis because of falling ad revenues , exacerbated by the recession .
Just how much the CBC needs to survive is a matter of conjecture .
" We 've been in discussions with the federal government about ( the bridge financing option ) for the past month , " said Jeff Keay , the broadcaster 's head of media relations .
" Senior management is focused on managing ( the shortfall ) without putting programs , services or jobs at risk . "
Management is working on a strategic plan to present to its board of directors before the end of March , he said .
But the corporation may be in deeper trouble than Stursberg is admitting , said Ian Morrison , spokesperson for Friends of Canadian Broadcasting , a broadcast industry watchdog group .
" We believe that the shortfall is $ 100 million or more , attributable to the decision last year to purchase several expensive U.S. TV properties , including Jeopardy , Wheel Of Fortune and The Martha Stewart Show , on airtight , multi- year contracts , " he said .
Even though the programs have won substantial audiences , the anticipated income has not materialized because of the media - wide decline in advertising revenue , coupled with the recession , Morrison said .
" It 's a perfect storm , the beginning of a death spiral .
" A $ 45 million shortfall in the summer has grown to $ 100 million or $ 125 million , " he said .
" To get out of that hole , CBC will have to make massive layoffs , as many as 600 or 700 of the most senior , costly employees , forcing the national broadcaster to be more centralized in Toronto and Montreal , and weakening its functions , scope and appeal . "

We 're Just Not That Into These Boots
Google will announce the next step in Gmail 's evolution , a new product with " a European multilingual angle , " on Monday .
At an event in Brussels to mark Gmail 's fifth birthday , Google will look at the impact of cloud computing on how people manage their daily tasks , review Gmail 's evolution to date and announce the next step in its progression , the company wrote in an invitation .
" Google is celebrating with the launch of an exciting new product " said the invitation .
Gmail , a free Web - based e-mail service with the then - unheard - of storage capacity of 1GB and Google 's trademark search capability , launched in 2004 .
Google 's playful announcement of the service , dated April 1 , proclaimed " Search is Number Two Online Activity -- Email is Number One ; ' Heck , Yeah , ' Say Google Founders . "
It looked like an April Fool 's Day joke at a time when Yahoo and Microsoft were offering Web mail accounts with under 10 MB of storage , with Yahoo offering an upgrade to 100 MB for US $ 50 a year .
It turned out to be true , prompting Yahoo and Microsoft to upgrade their offerings a few weeks later .
Five years after its launch , Gmail now offers over 7GB of storage but is still labelled as a beta version .
Monday 's announcement is not about the end of the beta trial , though : " It has more of a European multilingual angle to it , " a Google spokesman said .
Google already offers multilingual versions of the Gmail interface .
Initially available only in English , it now comes in 52 language options available , including most European languages and many in non-Roman writing systems , such as Chinese , Japanese and Korean .
The company has long offered tools that will translate a Web page on the fly into a language specified by the user .
It is also experimenting with a Translated Search service , still in beta , that allows surfers to make a search request in one language and receive results in another , then have those automatically translated into the first language .
The tool is particularly useful for those searching for information that is not readily available in their native language , and for which they would have difficulty formulating an appropriate search query .

The sheriff 's office in Richland County , S.C. , is investigating a report -- prompted by a photo of the event published in a British tabloid -- that Olympic hero Michael Phelps smoked marijuana there .
It 's possible Mr. Phelps will be prosecuted .
That 's right :
For those of you who do n't know , marijuana is illegal .
I 'm guessing it wo n't take much investigating to discover that Mr. Phelps used the drug at a University of South Carolina house party last November .

There ’s been some discussion around the blogosphere that Rick Warren doth protest too much about his feelings about gays and lesbians .
He loves us , he says , while he likens our relationships to pedophilia and incest .
Rick says he ’s got loads of gay friends who apparently believe it ’s natural to be promiscuous .
Some , like Susie Bright , say , however , that Rick ’s arguments and positions are eerily similar to another pastor who has now been shunned by fundamentalists :
Deja vu : major Fundie evangelist can’t stop talking about how disgusting gay people are , comparing them to incestors and pedophiles .
Decries loose women having abortions .
Demands his enemies be offed .
Then caps it all off with how much he “ loves ” everybody .
Send your check now !
Warren has all the earmarks we saw with Ted Haggard , Larry Craig , Bob Allen , David “ DiaperPants ” Vitter , et al .
It ’s a bad rerun .
In the heat of the controversy surrounding Warren ’s invitation to pray at Obama ’s inauguration , the web site at his Saddleback Church has been scrubbed of previous mentions that gay and lesbian people who are unwilling to “ repent ” of the “ lifestyle ” of homosexuality would not be able to join the church .
( Here is a cached version of the scrubbed page . )
A new page , however , repeats the same offensive anti-gay theology , comparing the sexual orientation of gays and lesbians to alcoholism and adultery .
As a lesbian who fully believes that I was born this way , I find it offensive to be told that my natural inclination to seek a long term , loving relationship with another woman is on par with an alcoholic jonesing for his next drink .
It pains me to have to point out to otherwise seemingly intelligent people that they are comparing apples and oranges .
Alcoholics and adulterers cause great harm to families and societies by abusing themselves and breaking covenant with others .
Certainly , there are gay and lesbian people who have drinking problems or have cheated on their partners .
However , their innate sexual orientation does not mean that they will automatically — because they are gay or lesbian — act in ways that are harmful to themselves or others .
The argument is spurious , but just reasonable enough to convince the uneducated and gullible that they can “ love the sinner , but hate the sin . ”
Just before Haggard ( who , by the way , did abuse himself and broke covenant ) admitted buying drugs and engaging in sex with a male prostitute , his views against homosexuality were front and center just like Warren ’s are now .
He appeared in the movie Jesus Camp pontificating on the evils of homosexuality .
In a new HBO documentary , airing January 29 , Haggard says he never claimed to be heterosexual and has struggled with his sexual identity his entire life .
In the end , he hid his true self fearing , “ that my friends would reject me , abandon me and kick me out , and the church would exile and excommunicate me .
And that happened and more . ”
In that , my heart goes out to Haggard .
Were it not for the vociferous anti-gay theological rhetoric coming from the church , perhaps a young Ted Haggard would have had the self - esteem required of a young gay man to be who he really was created to be .
If he had found support and love from a good church home , perhaps Ted Haggard would have become a great leader in the struggle for gay and lesbian rights .
Sadly , he ’s now a marginally successful insurance salesman — a “ loser , ” as he describes himself — and he still will not embrace his authentic self — believing the lie that he cannot be both gay and Christian .
Too many gay and lesbian people know Haggard ’s struggle and heartbreak over the church .
They ’ve been ostracized by their friends and family and exiled from church communities .
Warren ’s church is among those who have publicly proclaimed that no “ unrepentant ” gay and lesbian person is welcome as a member there .
The church has done such damage to the souls of God ’s gay and lesbian children and I grieve not just for them but for the church that has rejected the gifts and talents of gays and lesbians .
Churches are not supposed to be a place filled with saints .
Instead , it is to be a place where all broken and wounded people can be bound up by grace and encounter God ’s unconditional love .
Do I think Rick Warren is really gay and protesting too much ?
That ’s between him and God .
I ca n’t say .
What I can say is that the human damage from the kind of teachings Warren purveys is growing day by day .
About that we simply cannot protest too much .
why is global warming so cold ?
Just because it 's cold outside in your part of the world does n't mean global warming is n't happening .
It ’s cold where I am .
Really cold .
It ’s been really cold for the last two weeks and it ’ll be really cold for at least another week .
Then again , it ’s the middle of winter and I can’t say that I ’m surprised that it ’s cold at this time of the year .
It ’s kind of expected when you think about it .
But do n’t tell that to the anti-global warming crowd which is using this bitterly cold January to make snarky jokes about Al Gore and write editorials in which they say that there ’s no way a planet can be heating up when we ’re in the middle of a cold snap .
As shocking as it might sound , even in a warmer world it will still be cold and there will still be freezing rains , icy temperatures and bitter cold snaps .
When scientists talk about a warming trend , they ’re talking about a maximum warming of five or six degrees averaged for the entire planet .
The middle of winter will still be cold and snowy , it ’s just that the places where it will be cold will be farther north than they are today .
Do n’t get me wrong though .
Five or six degrees up or down for the entire planet is the difference between an ice age and a hothouse .
In the last Ice Age it was just five degrees colder than it is today .
And yes , there were warm , humid places during the ice ages , it ’s just that the polar ice sheets grew to cover much more area than they do today and winters in the north lasted longer .
Global warming does n’t mean that temperatures wo n’t go down by more than a few degrees as the forests around you burn to a cinder and your backyard turns into a barren desert .
Likewise , a cold snap does n’t disprove averages compiled over decades .
We ca n’t accurately predict the weather because weather is chaotic and measured by hours and days .
It ’s like a coin flip .
Heads or tails .
But climate is an average of hundreds of these coin flips and we know that over time , if we toss enough coins , we ’ll have a similar number of heads to tails .
Climate modeling just ups the temperature ranges we measured over many decades and tries to see what happens to our planet when the average temperature across the globe is higher or lower than it is today .
If you want to disprove our grip on climate , show some data for winters with average temperatures of 30 degrees randomly interchanging with 70 degree winters without a special cause behind it .
Finally , there ’s the Al Gore thing .
I ’ve written before how Gore did a disservice to climatologists by injecting partisan bickering into what should ’ve been a purely scientific debate .
Really , this issue is n’t about a person who embraced global warming as a cause to stay in the limelight .
It ’s about the science and trying to stay objective .
With the amount of vitriol many critics direct at the former vice - president , I ca n’t help but wonder if the same crowd would be lambasting him for missing the “ threat to our planet ” were he a global warming denier instead …
update 01.06.2010 :
As odd as it may seem , it ’s cold in the winter of 2010 too , and due to a peak in this post ’s traffic , I thought it would be beneficial to revisit the topic of weather vs. climate and cover more information on the politics and science of global warming in a follow up entry .
THE community 's need for extreme fire warnings must be balanced with the heightened risk of arson , the Country Fire Authority says .
Telecommunications companies on Monday sent Victorians just under 5 million text messages advising of extreme weather forecasts .
A grass and scrub fire noticed about 12.30 am yesterday on the foreshore at Chelsea , in Melbourne 's south - east , was " definitely due to arson " , CFA chief fire officer Russell Rees said .
Police are also investigating a spate of fires believed to have been deliberately lit in Melbourne 's north on Friday .
Last night , we had a sweet tryst with the Planet Express gang .
NYCC screened the fourth direct - to - DVD movie Into The Wild Green Yonder for hundreds of Futurama fanatics .

Watching " Into the Wild Green Yonder , " the fourth and final installment in Futurama 's mostly excellent series of direct - to - DVD releases , I was reminded of a Simpsons commentary ( or several ) , where the writers mention what a joy it is to watch the show with an audience of fans at conventions .
Hence , viewing " Yonder " in a packed auditorium full of sci - fi geeks made the film feel like an old favorite you catch on Adult Swim at 3 AM .
Time will tell how it holds up on future viewings .
" The Simpsons Movie " felt like a season five classic when I saw it at a sold - out midnight screening .
Yet its quality diminishes ever so slightly on subsequent HBO viewings .
But for now , I 'm pleased to report that " Into the Wild Green Yonder " is a fantastic conclusion to a DVD series that produced only one real dissapointment .
( That being D&D - themed dullfest " Bender 's Game . " ) " Yonder " meets all the prerequisites for a quality Futurama episode .
Endless scifi winks / nods / rip - offs , ingenious robot - related visual gags and the usual sprawling cast of beloved characters .
The Hypno - Toad 's blink - and - you 'll - miss - it cameo was met with rapturous applause .
And Zapp Brannigan received such a warm welcome you 'd think Billy West was sitting on stage waiting to moderate the cast and crew panel .
( Alas , there was no panel . )

And as always , since the Futurama writing team is stocked with more Harvard math majors than Texas Instruments , there 's a couple of science references clearly meant for about .01 % of the audience .
Personal favorite : a space - zamboni buffs the rings of Saturn , while a sign in the background reads " Mind The Keeler Gap . "
That being the 42 - kilometer wide gap in Saturn 's A-ring , not a nod to Futurama / Simpsons scribe Ken Keeler .
Hey guess what , Keeler majored in Applied Mathematics at Harvard University !
Hmm , what am I forgetting ?
Oh right , the plot .
Just a little trifle about 12 % of the Milky Way in danger of being vaporized to make way for an interstellar " miniature " golf course .
I put miniature in quotes because it just does n't seem right to call a King Kong themed mini golf hole in space that would have to be many , many ( many ) miles long " mini . "
The King Kong hole also bears an uncanny similarity to the one located in Springfield 's " Sir Putt - A - Lot 's Merrie Olde Fun Centre , " where Bart and Todd Flanders once battled and also where Bart was in fact conceived .
( Please refer to Simpsons classics " Dead Putting Society " and " I Married Marge " for more information . )
So yeah , the fate of the galaxy hangs in the balance , and of course the only people around to save the day are the crew of the Planet Express .
I 'd go into more detail , but why spoil the fun when you can see for yourself when " Into the Wild Green Yonder " drops on February 24th .
The only question left to ponder is whether this is really the last we 'll see of Futurama .
88 episodes and four feature - length films leaves a lot to cherish , and it 's pretty damn plentiful compared to other TV cancellation tragedies .
( Firefly , Arrested Development , Mr. Show ... shall I continue ? )

Harvard economist : Prohibition creates violence , legalize all drugs David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Tuesday March 24 , 2009
Print This Email This Because of his title as a Harvard economist , people tend to listen to Jeffrey Miron .
And , if the old principle holds true and controversy always creates interest , expect a lot of people to be talking about Miron 's latest volley into the mainstream media .
" Prohibition creates violence because it drives the drug market underground , " he wrote in an essay published by CNN on Tuesday .
" This means buyers and sellers cannot resolve their disputes with lawsuits , arbitration or advertising , so they resort to violence instead .
" Violence was common in the alcohol industry when it was banned during Prohibition , but not before or after . "
Miron 's proposed solution to ending the cartel war along the US - Mexico border is both simple and enormously complex .
" Violence is the norm in illicit gambling markets but not in legal ones .
Violence is routine when prostitution is banned but not when it 's permitted , " he wrote .
" Violence results from policies that create black markets , not from the characteristics of the good or activity in question .
" The only way to reduce violence , therefore , is to legalize drugs . "
In 2005 , Miron published a study titled , " The Budgetary Implications of Marijuana Prohibition " ( PDF link ) , funded by the Marijuana Policy Project .
Over 500 professional economists , including Milton Friedman , signed on to the report , which was sent to then - President George W. Bush .
Miron 's report found that " marijuana legalization would save $ 7.7 billion per year in state and federal expenditures on prohibition enforcement and produce tax revenues of at least $ 2.4 billion annually if marijuana were taxed like most consumer goods . "
He also discovered a potential for $ 6.2 billion or more , were marijuana taxed similarly to alcohol and tobacco .
However , during a CNN appearance on Tuesday , he took the anti-prohibition sentiment of his prior study on marijuana and applied it universally , telling anchor Kiran Chetry , " A lot of the violence we 're seeing and a lot of the underground market is not related to marijuana but related to the other drugs .
" If we only did marijuana we would only have a small impact on the violence and corruption and disruption of other countries that is caused by U.S. prohibition of drugs and the U.S. forcing prohibition of drugs on other countries . "

Kenny Chesney Opens Up About Renee Zellweger Split
It has been a long time in coming but country music sensationhas finally opened up about his four month marriage to actress
Admitting that he could not commit to marriage and his music career , Kenny did n't know what marriage really meant and more to the point , what it meant to be thrust into the media spotlight .
He claims that he really lived under the radar until he wed Renee back in 2005 .
Reports claimed that Kenny was blindsided when Zellweger filed for divorce .
Not so , says Chesney .
Somebody had to do it and he knew it was coming and he was " fine with it . "
" My band , my crew , everybody on the road - they were acting differently .
I 'd go to a concert and there would be helicopters circling , trying to get a picture of me and her together .
I never really had any kind of attention from the paparazzi .
It went from zero to the complete other end of the spectrum ... I thought it would be like that all the time ... I panicked ... I ran ... I pushed her away ... I did n't want to be married to her anymore . "
Chesney said that he has n't spoke to Renee in over a year and the last time he called her they spoke for only 5 minutes .
He said it 's just too hard .
Check out more Renee photos here .
Lucy , the world 's most famous fossil human ancestor , has gone digital in 3 - D .
A new high - resolution CT scan of the 3.2 million - year - old skeleton will provide scientists around the globe with information that may help settle debates about human evolution .
The virtual Lucy could prove invaluable to scientists by giving them their first glimpse inside her fossilized bones .
The scans reveal microscopic details of the internal structure of Lucy ’s bones and teeth that give clues to how she moved and ate .
“ These scans will ensure that future generations are familiar with Lucy , ” said Jara Mariam , director general of Ethiopia ’s Authority for Research and Conservation of Cultural Heritage , “ and will know of Ethiopia ’s central contribution to the study of human evolution .
A virtual Lucy will be able to visit every classroom on the planet . ”
Several versions of the virtual Lucy will eventually be available to the public , according to paleoanthropologist John Kappelman of the University of Texas .
A website with a basic version will allow students to look at Lucy and compare her skeleton with those of modern humans and apes , while researchers will be able to access high - resolution files .
Lucy 's bones , discovered in Ethiopia in 1974 , represent the most complete remains of any adult human ancestor that walked on two feet .
The prized fossil — currently on display at the Pacific Science Center in Seattle , Washington — sparked a controversy in 2007 when it was shipped to the United States from Ethiopia , because of concerns that it could be damaged .
Now that Lucy has been digitally archived , scientists and students will be able to harmlessly examine the bones using tools available on the web .
Medical CAT scans like those done in hospitals show a cross-section of a patient ’s body with 1 - 2 mm resolution .
But because Lucy is n't a living patient , much higher - energy X - rays can be used .
The computed tomography , or CT , scans done on Lucy reveal internal details on the order of 5 - 50 microns — less than the width of a human hair .
That level of detail could yield unprecedented insight into our ancestors .
Pre-digital Lucy has already clarified key issues in the study of human evolution .
Previous examinations revealed that our ancestors started walking on two feet before they developed large brains .
The shape of her pelvis , feet , knees , and hip joints are all indicators that Lucy walked upright despite having a brain about the size of a chimpanzee .
But many questions remain .
Although there is little doubt that Lucy ’s species , Australopithecus afarensis , walked on two feet , it is less clear whether she and her kin also spent much time in the trees .
Certain features of her skeleton — curved fingers and toes , the orientation of the shoulder joint , and relatively long arms — suggest at least a partially arboreal lifestyle .
However , other experts contend that these features are evolutionary holdovers from tree - dwelling ancestors .
The question of whether Lucy ’s species actually climbed trees or just inherited traits associated with tree - climbers is a long - standing debate among paleoanthropologists that the CT scans may help resolve .
“ If we can compare the cross-sectional structural features of the limb bones we should be able to answer this question definitively , ” said anthropologist Christopher Ruff of Johns Hopkins University .
Because bones get reinforced when they are extensively used ( a right - handed tennis player will have thicker bones in the right arm than the left ) researchers can compare Lucy ’s upper versus lower limbs to see which she used more often .
“ Your bones respond to how you use them , ” explained paleobiologist Brian Richmond of George Washington University .
“ We know that spongy bone is especially sensitive to changes in activity and exercise . ”
By comparing the thickness and the distribution of spongy bone in Lucy ’s arms versus her legs , the researchers hope to finally determine if she spent much time in trees .
Because Lucy ’s skeleton is so complete — nearly 40 percent of her remains were discovered — she is the only fossil of her species where such a test is possible , because comparing the arm bone of one individual with the leg bone of another could be misleading .
The scans were conducted at the University of Texas at Austin ’s High Resolution X - Ray CT Facility , which has extensive experience with unique and valuable specimens including the brain case of Archaeopteryx and a Martian meteorite .
Yet , because of her high profile status , having Lucy at the facility provided a new challenge .
“ It ’s the first national treasure we ’ve ever scanned , ” said geologist Richard Ketcham , director of the facility .
Only Alemu Admassu , the curator of Ethiopia ’s National Museum , was allowed to actually touch the fossils during the scanning process .
Careful inspections before and after the scans verified that Lucy was not damaged during the procedure .
Now that the delicate work of conducting the CT scans is complete , the tedious job of analyzing the vast amount of data will begin .
The team of researchers will spend the next few months trying to extract as much information as possible from the virtual Lucy .
“ In some ways , ” Ketcham said , “ scanning Lucy was the easy part . "

10 Germ Myths Under the Microscope
Experts Tell Which Germ Concerns Are Legit
As you take steps to avoid the germs and viruses that proliferate as winter progresses , you 've no doubt received a good share of advice on how to avoid catching whatever 's going around .
ABCNews OnCall + spoke with experts about some of the popular myths about germs that tend to spread as fast as the bacteria themselves this time of year .
Is a dog 's mouth cleaner than a person's ?
How unsafe are public toilet seats ?
Some of these questions lack hard data , and the study findings sometimes conflict .
So before taking advice from your friends , you might want to check their wisdom about our microbe neighbors .
Fact or Myth ?
You can get infections or illnesses from sitting directly on a public toilet seat .
Answer : Myth
" Just sort of sitting on the seat and having that contact with the skin on your butt is n't going to be a way of transmitting an infection , " said Elizabeth Scott , co-director and founder of the Simmons Center for Hygiene and Health in Home and Community Settings at Simmons College in Boston .
" I think that one 's associated with the fact that we all find public toilets very disgusting , " she said , adding that you were more likely to get sick from touching the toilet seat or the flush handle with your hand .
Dr. J. Owen Hendley , professor of pediatric infectious disease at the University of Virginia Children 's Hospital , said that this myth has been a persistent one .
Of getting an infection , he said , " I guess you could , but I 've never known of a documented case where that actually happened . "
But that has not stopped the myth .
Hendley noted that the concern might have originated with a fear that syphilis could spread through toilet seats .
He said that that fear is likely behind the design of many public toilet seats in which the seat itself is open in the front , preventing contact between the person and the seat in that area .
But the knowledge that sitting directly on the seat does n't spread the germs does n't seem likely to make it more appealing .

" I could n't imagine it [ spreading infection ] , " said Hendley .
" Which is not to say I would like to go into a public restroom and sit down on the toilet seat . "
Fact or Myth ?
If you keep your toothbrush within 6 feet of your toilet , you 're brushing your teeth with toilet water .
Answer : Possibly a Fact
" You get a great spray out of the toilet when you flush it , " said Charles Gerba , a professor of microbiology at the University of Arizona .
" This throws bacteria out of the toilet . "
Gerba 's research showed a spray coming out of toilets when they are flushed .
That spray goes out and puts fecal bacteria and whatever else is in the toilet all over everything else in the bathroom , right ?
Maybe not .
A few years ago , the Discovery Channel 's " Mythbusters " tackled the issue .
In its tests , the show placed toothbrushes near the toilet , in a bathroom cabinet and in the kitchen of a house .
At the end of the test , the show declared the toilet - toothbrush - shower a myth , with all three toothbrushes having similar amounts of fecal bacteria , regardless of placement .
So we know there 's a spray when the toilet gets flushed , but it 's unclear how far it travels and what ends up where .
Ultimately , the problem may be that there has n't been a peer - reviewed study of toothbrush hygiene .
We do n't know where the bacteria travel , and we do n't know the source of bacteria that may have ended up on the toothbrushes placed in various areas .
" A lot of the droplets that are generated when you flush a toilet , they are too large to spread probably more than a foot or two , " said Sattar .
Fecal bacteria means the bacterium E. coli , which is found in fecal matter , among other things .
While often used to gross someone out about bacterial contamination , just finding it does n't mean the germs came from the toilet .
So it 's not entirely clear that your toothbrush is showering in your toilet water just because it 's nearby .
But it may not be a bad idea to put the lid down when you flush .
Fact or Myth ?
The blowing air from a hand drier in a public restroom spreads germs .
Answer : Myth
Syed Sattar , a professor emeritus of microbiology at the University of Ottawa , has looked into this issue , and was more than happy to declare it an outdated concern .
" That is certainly a myth , because we have done our own studies in that regard , " he said .
Sattar said his team had sampled the air around driers in various public restrooms as people were using them and found no increase in bacteria .
As to the rumor that dust accumulates inside , he said his team had taken apart multiple hand driers in places like bus stations and busy shopping centers and also found nothing .
The real worry about hand driers , said Scott , is having to touch something to start them .
" It 's always good to look for systems that do n't require you to touch , " she said , because the buttons will accumulate germs .
Ideal restrooms , Scott said , would n't have doors or handles for the faucet , and would have electronic eyes to start hand driers , faucets and flush mechansms on toilets .
" No - touch is ideal , " Scott said .
Fact or Myth ?
Antibacterial soap keeps your hands cleaner than regular soap .
Answer : Myth
This myth may stem from a misconception about what we do when we wash our hands .
By rinsing in soap and water for at least 20 seconds , we are n't supposed to be killing bacteria , but simply getting germs and viruses off our hands .
" If you can get to a sink and you can wash your hands thoroughly 15 to 20 seconds with regular soap and then rinsing -- that is the most effective method of ' de - germing ' , or removing germs from your hands , " said Scott .
She noted that washing with soap and water does n't remove all the microbes from our hands , because some are an important part of our skin , and even if we did kill them , they would return .
Given that regular soap and water removes the germs , there is no need for an antibacterial agent , and it probably wo n't work anyway .
" The speed of action of these ingredients that are added is rather slow , so that they are not there on the hands long enough to present the desired level of reductions , " said Sattar .
So the antibacterial agents added to soap , typically triclosan , is n't effective in this case but may present problems , as our next myth explains .
Fact or Myth ?
Alcohol rubs cause bacterial mutation and help create resistant strains .
Answer : Myth for Alcohol Rubs , Possibly a Fact for Antibacterial Soap
The alcohol - based antibacterial rubs are effective enough that they do not create resistant strains , explained Scott , but the antibacterial soaps may present a hazard .
While the alcohol rub stays on the hands and is not meant to be rinsed off , the antibacterial triclosan is rinsed off before it can do all its work and then enters the water supply .
" The reason I do n't like it is because it gets in the water supply and stuff like that , " said Hendley of his opposition to triclosan in soap .
Scott notes that resistant strains of bacteria have been created in labs using triclosan , although it remains to be seen if it will happen in the natural environment .
" It 's something that 's been observed in the laboratory , and it 's something that needs to be researched , " she said .
For Sattar , the long - term risks of triclosan in the environment also need to be looked at .
" Their accumulation in the environment or chronic exposure to them on a long - term basis , especially for children , may have a long - term risk that we will not discover until later on , " he said .
Ultimately , Sattar said , antibacterial soap does n't do enough to justify its use .
" Do n't take risk without a demonstrated benefit , " he said .
Fact or Myth ?
Sponges typically do n't help keep your kitchen cleaner , they just spread germs around .
Answer : Fact
Sponges pick up various contaminants when used to clean used to clean dishes or surfaces that food has touched , and those contaminants can be easily spread .
" Sponges are probably the most germ - laden object in the household , " said Gerba .
" They usually contain 10,000,000 or more fecal bacteria .
In a study we did some years ago , we found salmonella in 10 percent of them .
The reason is that they are wet and pick up food for the bacteria .
They do a great job of spreading bacteria around the household . "
So in order to keep sponges from being bacteria farms for your kitchen , several steps should be taken .
Hendley said he maintains separate counter and dish sponges and makes sure to have detergent in the sponge whenever he uses it .
Scott said that maintaining separate dish and counter sponges is key .
" I think the best practice is to keep the sponge at the kitchen sink for washing up , and to use paper towels for wiping down kitchen surfaces , " she said .
Sponges can be placed in the dishwasher or laundry to decontaminate them , although the research on how much that helps remains unclear .
Perhaps the best way to clean sponges is by microwaving them , but it 's important to ensure that they are wet before putting them in .
Fact or Myth ?
Plastic cutting boards are more sanitary than wooden ones .
Answer : Fact -- if the board 's handled right
The difference in sanitation has little to do with the cutting boards themselves .
" [ The cutting boards ] are about the same , " said Gerba .
" In the average household they have 200 times more fecal bacteria that the average toilet seat . "
Scott explains that the wear on the cutting board affects its cleanliness more than the material from which it 's made .
" The most important thing is , whatever cutting board anyone 's using , it 's not badly scoured , " she said .
So why did we deem this a fact ?
As Scott explained , a plastic cutting board is easier to clean , by bleaching it at the sink or putting it through the dishwasher .
In any case , she noted , separate cutting boards should be used for raw chicken or beef and vegetables .
And ultimately , the plastic cutting boards are more sanitary , Scott said , because they 're cheaper -- so people are more likely to throw them out and replace them .
Fact or Myth ?
The makeup at a cosmetics counter is unsafe to use -- it harbors a multitude of germs .
Answer : Probably a Fact
The safety of using sample cosmetics from the counter may depend on how they 're used , but the prospect of what could be in that makeup is enough to keep Scott away from them .
" I do n't like that idea at all , " she said .
" There is the possibility that someone handled the cosmetic who had pathogens on their hands or a skin infection or an eye infection .
That all might be transmitted by that cosmetic . "
There does n't appear to much hard data on what the cosmetics at the counter contain , but their usage could lead to the spread of infection .
Scott 's advice is to stick to single use samples and avoid the communal beauty sources .
Fact or Myth ?
A dog's mouth is cleaner than a person 's mouth .
Answer : Myth
If you heard this myth , it probably came from a dog lover as they justified why they let their pet lick their face .
And in one sense , they may be right : A dog 's mouth is likely to contain fewer microbes that are harmful to humans .
" If I were forced to be bitten by a dog or a human , I 'd take a dog , " said Hendley .
But that does n't mean a dog's mouth has fewer microbes , or that it 's " clean . "
" I 'm thinking , what was the dog last licking ? " said Scott .
Hendley and Scott noted that dogs tend to lick themselves , particularly after scraping themselves , and their mouths tend to come in contact with animal feces .
Scott also noted that germs can be picked up by stroking the animals , and you should wash your hands anytime you touch them .
Fact or Myth ?
Airplanes are a major source of contamination because of the recirculated air .
Answer : Unclear
Airplanes put many different people in a confined space for several hours with the same air .
Small wonder that some see planes as flying germ houses .
But while germs may once have recirculated freely , new technology may have removed some of the flight concerns .
ABCNews OnCall + has previously looked at the issue , and travel can increase risk of flu ( which comes from a virus , not a germ ) , but that is a concern in any crowded area , not just an airplane .
The recirculated air , however , is not as much of a concern as it may once have been .
" It probably was true in the sense that inside of an aircraft cabin , if filled to capacity , you would have a lot of people breathing germs in and out , " said Sattar .
But , he said , " More recent aircraft design has created engineering controls which reduce that risk . "
Sattar notes that HEPAs , or high efficiency particulate arresters , which were developed around World War II , trap tiny particles in the air so that any particle that might be carrying viruses or bacteria is caught when viruses pass through the air system in the aircraft .
So planes , like any crowded area , pose an increased disease risk , but it is n't clear how much , if any , of that is due to the recirculated air .
Sattar also noted that the World Health Organization will be examining this issue to ensure that passengers are n't sharing illnesses with their fellow travelers .

Over the centuries , the French have cultivated the fine art of rebellion .
The list of targets encompasses tyrants , wars , colonialism and , above all , capitalism in its many manifestations .
The latest enemy may seem unlikely : billboards .
The Dismantlers , as a nationwide group of anti-ad crusaders call themselves , are n’t violent or loud or clandestine .
In fact , they invite the police to protest rallies where they deface signs .
With a copywriter ’s flair , one of their slogans warns : “ Attention !
Avert your eyes from ads :
You risk being very strongly manipulated . ”
The goal of the Dismantlers is to get arrested , argue the righteousness of their cause in court and , you guessed it , gain publicity .
“ We challenge the mercantile society that destroys all human relationships , professional relationships , health , the environment , ” said Alexandre Baret , 35 , a founder of the group .
“ It ’s a message that proposes to attack advertising as the fuel of this not very healthy society . ”

Despite the stick - it - to - the - man rhetoric , there were neckties and briefcases in the crowd at an evening rally here a while back .
Part - time insurgents had come from work for the gathering in the Place Malesherbes , an elegant , tree - lined plaza graced by statues of the author Alexandre Dumas and his musketeer hero D’Artagnan , one of literature ’s most irrepressible swashbucklers .
The 80 - odd demonstrators , looking bohemian and stylish , listened to Baret set the ideological stage .
The red - bearded schoolteacher and father of four explained that he does n’t want to abolish advertising , just limit signs to no more than 1.2 feet by 1.6 feet .
The current wall - size dimensions are obtrusive and oppressive , he said .
The large and colorful billboards that are a fixture of the Paris streetscape are hard to ignore , especially the many suggestive ads for undergarments .
Some consider them artistic ; religious fundamentalists condemn them as proof of Western decadence .
“ You see commercial messages every day , you get them right in the face , in the subway , in the street , all the time , and if you do n’t want to , you do not have the choice , ” Baret declared over a megaphone .
“ So we are obliged to resort to civil disobedience .
In a symbolic manner , we will tag a few billboards in order to provoke debate and push for things to progress . ”

Baret urged the crowd to give a cordial welcome to the police .
Advised by the activists ahead of time , the authorities had dispatched a squad of riot police , the renowned head - thumpers of the CRS , or Republican Security Companies .
The officers formed a cordon : burly and stern in blue uniforms , black gloves , pants tucked into lace - up boots .
They looked bemused .
They were no doubt thankful to tangle with polite leftists instead of housing - project gangs who have been known to “ welcome ” police with bricks , Molotov cocktails and gunfire .
Under Baret ’s direction , three activists approached billboards promoting audiovisual products and a television talk show and spray - painted them with slogans .
The police slapped on handcuffs and led their prisoners to a van .
There was applause .
An accordion accompanied the crowd in a popular song , “ The Deserter , ” with lyrics modified for the occasion .
And that was that .
The Dismantlers represent an enduring contradiction of the French mentality .
The center - right won the last elections by a comfortable margin .
Juggernaut industries sell the world everything from jets to trains to wine .
The average citizen enjoys long vacations , a beach or country home and a lifestyle that is the envy of the West .
Advertisement
Nonetheless , a large percentage of the population tells pollsters that it is hostile to the capitalist system .
That ideological current produced the anti-advertising movement , which took off in 2003 and has won sympathy with its mix of economic and environmental messages .
“ I think that when you get down to it , they are right , ” said Marina , 33 , a restaurant worker who stopped to see what the fuss was about in the Place Malesherbes .
“ Between TV , Internet and advertising billboards , we are told about consumption all the time . ”
But Marina expressed doubt that this particular mini-revolution would triumph .
“ I find it funny , but a little useless , ” she said .
“ I think tagging ads bothers passersby more than anything .
A sign full of graffiti is even worse than having to look at an ad . ”
Advertisement
Unlike anarchists or other groups that engage in hit - and - run tactics , the Dismantlers see the courtroom as a battlefield of choice .
They gather contributions to pay fines that are often low because judges tend to be lenient and the vandalism is calculated to remain minimal .
Baret appeared at a hearing last month on charges of “ unauthorized advertising . ”
The case involved an incident in 2007 when he was caught plastering commuter trains with the “ avert your eyes ” stickers .
Baret , who like his fellow insurgents is a veteran defendant , had refused to pay the $ 58 fine .
His lawyer argued that his actions were less destructive than the 57,000 giant signs that fill the train stations of France .
“ The advertisements are energy - intensive , they use paper from forests , ” the lawyer said .
“ It ’s an assault on individual liberties , an advertising aggression . ”

In response , the prosecutor reminded the accused that “ the tribunal is not a tribune . ”
A lawyer representing the French railroad company , which demanded a symbolic $ 1.30 in damages and $ 650 for legal costs , chided the activists for returning to rabble - rousing of “ years ago . ”
A verdict is expected in February .
But the Dismantlers say they have already won by making people stop and think about the messages that bombard them each day .
“ The advertising budget in France is $ 39 billion a year , ” said Antoine Trouillard , a 26 - year - old philosophy student and activist .
“ That ’s equivalent to the entire education budget in France . . . .
Our movement goes a lot further than a simple symbolic gesture .
And that ’s what we want the public to understand . ”

Geert Wilders lives under police protection because of death threats A Dutch court has ordered prosecutors to put a right - wing politician on trial for making anti-Islamic statements .
Freedom Party leader Geert Wilders made a controversial film last year equating Islam with violence and has likened the Koran to Adolf Hitler 's Mein Kampf .
" In a democratic system , hate speech is considered so serious that it is in the general interest to ... draw a clear line , " the court in Amsterdam said .
Mr Wilders said the judgement was an " attack on the freedom of expression " .
" Participation in the public debate has become a dangerous activity .
If you give your opinion , you risk being prosecuted , " he said .
Not only he , but all Dutch citizens opposed to the " Islamisation " of their country would be on trial , Mr Wilders warned .
" Who will stand up for our culture if I am silenced ? " he added .
' Incitement '
The three judges said that they had weighed Mr Wilders 's " one- sided generalisations " against his right to free speech , and ruled that he had gone beyond the normal leeway granted to politicians .
This is a happy day for all followers of Islam who do not want to be tossed on the garbage dump of Nazism
Gerard Spong , lawyer
Profile : Geert Wilders Relief over MP 's anti-Islam film " The Amsterdam appeals court has ordered the prosecution of member of parliament Geert Wilders for inciting hatred and discrimination , based on comments by him in various media on Muslims and their beliefs , " the court said in a statement .
" The court also considers appropriate criminal prosecution for insulting Muslim worshippers because of comparisons between Islam and Nazism made by Wilders , " it added .
The court 's ruling reverses a decision last year by the public prosecutor 's office , which said Mr Wilders 's comments had been made outside parliament as a contribution to the debate on Islam in Dutch society and that no criminal offence had been committed .
Prosecutors said on Wednesday that they could not appeal against the judgement and would open an investigation immediately .
Gerard Spong , a prominent lawyer who pushed for Mr Wilders 's prosecution , welcomed the court 's decision .
" This is a happy day for all followers of Islam who do not want to be tossed on the garbage dump of Nazism , " he told reporters .
' Fascist book '
In March 2008 , Mr Wilders posted a film about the Koran on the internet , prompting angry protests across the Muslim World .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The opening scenes of Fitna - a Koranic term sometimes translated as " strife " - show a copy of the holy book followed by footage of the bomb attacks on the US on 11 September 2001 , London in July 2005 and Madrid in March 2004 .
Pictures appearing to show Muslim demonstrators holding up placards saying " God bless Hitler " and " Freedom go to hell " also feature .
The film ends with the statement : " Stop Islamisation .
Defend our freedom . "
Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende said at the time that the film wrongly equated Islam with violence and served " no purpose other than to offend " .
A year earlier , Mr Wilders described the Koran as a " fascist book " and called for it to be banned in " the same way we ban Mein Kampf " , in a letter published in the De Volkskrant newspaper .
Mr Wilders has had police protection since Dutch director Theo Van Gogh was killed by a radical Islamist in 2004 .
Correspondents say his Freedom Party ( PVV ) , which has nine MPs in the lower house of parliament , has built its popularity largely by tapping into the fear and resentment of Muslim immigrants .

When most people gaze up on a clear , dark night , they are struck by how many stars there are .
Astronomers have an opposite reaction :
They marvel at the stars ’ amazing scarcity .
Considering the total amount of raw material available in our galaxy for star formation , there should be up to 10 times the current count .
Why , then , does the night sky not blaze with starlight ?
It is not a bad thing that there are so few stars ; quite the opposite .
Stars burn gas , mostly hydrogen .
All of the hydrogen gas in the universe was formed during the Big Bang , some 13.8 billion years ago .
Each galaxy possesses a finite portion of this primordial fuel , and there is no way to make any more of it .
If there were more stars , galaxies would burn through their fuel reserves more quickly and would shine more briefly before lapsing into eternal darkness .
Understanding how stars form and why they are so hard to make does much more than just foretell our far - off cosmic future .
Star birth also explains where the atoms in our bodies come from and why the universe looks the way it does today .
As astronomer John Bally of the University of Colorado puts it , “ Star formation is the single most important process for determining the fate and evolution of normal matter in the universe . ”
Yet until recently , the details of how stars are born were literally shrouded in mystery : Stars form within dense clouds of dust and gas that block visible light .
Now astronomers are parting the veil with telescopes that detect infrared light , the kind of light central to terrestrial night - vision systems .
“ Seeing in infrared light is important because the diminution of visible light from inside a dusty cloud can be enormous , ” says Judy Pipher , a professor of observational and experimental astronomy at the University of Rochester in New York .
“ This is not a problem when you use an infrared camera because at those longer wavelengths the cloud will be a million times more transparent . ”
If galaxies raced through their fuel reserves , creating lots of first - generation stars early on , few stars with rocky planets would be born later .
The odds for life would be much worse .
Earth might very well not even exist .
The picture of star formation given to us by infrared telescopes is one of unexpected violence , and it is this violence that is the key to understanding why there are so few stars .
The birth of one disrupts the formation of others nearby , limiting the rate at which raw hydrogen can be assembled into shining stars .
Efforts to spy on the star - birth process got a huge boost with NASA ’s launch of the Spitzer Space Telescope in 2003 .
Pipher , considered by many to be the mother of infrared astronomy , worked for 20 years with collaborators William Forrest and Dan Watson to develop the detectors that form the heart of this 2,000 - pound floating observatory .
Spitzer does not orbit Earth but trails behind us in space , following Earth ’s orbit around the sun at a distance of about 56 million miles .
Spitzer was sent so far out because its delicate infrared - sensitive instruments must be kept at a frigid temperature just above absolute zero , and it is easier to maintain that temperature by operating far from the heat that radiates from the surface of our planet .
Spitzer ’s new views of stellar nurseries as places of chaos and turbulence contrast sharply with astronomers ’ old preconceptions .
In the absence of the direct view provided by infrared telescopes , scientists spent the bulk of the last century building beautiful theories of individual gas clouds collapsing gracefully under their own gravity to form individual stars .
The basic model of star formation was mapped out by British astrophysicist Sir James Jeans a little over 100 years ago .
Jeans began with a large cloud of interstellar gas whose inward pull of gravity perfectly balanced the outward push of pressure from its own internal heat .
Jeans found that this balance was unstable .
With just a nudge — from , say , the remnants of a super­nova shock wave — gravity would win the tug - of - war and start the cloud ’s collapsing in on itself .
At the center of the cloud , matter would pile up to densities and temperatures that ( scientists later realized ) were high enough to allow hydrogen atoms to fuse into helium .
When fusion began , a star was born .
Most of the 20th century was spent filling in the details of Jeans ’s story .
“ You begin with single stars because they are simple , ” says Héctor Arce , an astrophysicist at Yale University .
“ They are kind of a theorist ’s dream . ”
These early models paid scant attention to the way infant stars might influence each other .
“ Before we could understand how neighbors affect individual star formation , ” explains Arce ’s former thesis advisor , Alyssa Goodman of the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics , “ we had to understand the evolution of stars in isolation .
That was pretty complicated in itself . ”
During the 1980s and 1990s , Spitzer ’s less sophisticated predecessors put astronomers on the trail of a more holistic model of star formation .
From hard - won infrared images , a story much more complex than Jeans ’s emerged about the birth of stars and planets .
Star formation , those first pictures hinted , is distinctly a family affair — with all the turbulence , chaos , and tumult that implies .
Astronomers realized that spinning disks of gas always form around the nucleus of a new star , feeding it matter and serving as an incubator for the development of planets .
The disks form because of the natural rotation of the original gas clouds .
Just as a spinning ice - skater who pulls her arms inward will increase the speed of her spin , gas in a collapsing cloud will rotate more quickly until it naturally forms a spinning disk .
If interstellar magnetic fields thread the cloud , then they , too , will be carried downward with the collapsing , spinning gas .
The twisting magnetic fields will act as drive belts , tapping the enormous energy of the spinning disk to launch powerful jets of gas along the axis of the disk and back out into space .
These jets are remarkably long lived , driving 10 light - years or more across the star - forming environment .
The discovery of jets pushing away from dust - shrouded protostars at hundreds of miles per second was the first hint to astronomers that star formation was a far more chaotic process than they had envisioned .
Over the past couple of decades , intense effort in both theory and observation allowed astronomers to develop a coherent , consistent picture of how single stars were born that included gas disks and jets .
But researchers knew their story was still woefully incomplete because it did not take into account how one star ’s formation might affect another ’s .
“ The problem , ” Goodman explains , “ is that you need to see into the entire cloud where many stars are forming at once .
But the clouds are dense , and they extend over large chunks of the sky .
You need new instruments , and you have to be systematic if you really want to understand what is going on . ”
Spitzer was built , in part , to answer these needs .
With Spitzer ’s three - foot - wide infrared eye , astronomers can see deep into the youngest stellar nurseries where stars are just beginning to form .
They can see protostellar disks taking shape and pushing their jets out into space , and they have worked to integrate the new data with results from optical and radio telescopes ( radio waves , millimeter wavelengths in particular , can penetrate the dust and gas too ) .
Combining radio and infrared observations , researchers like Goodman and Arce created high - resolution , multiwavelength images of entire star - forming clouds .
This multiyear , multi-institution project , called the Complete Survey , gave astronomers the view they needed to study star formation in a global context .
Finally they could map out the detailed nature of interactions between infant stars and their environment , and a true portrait of star formation began to emerge .
“ You really have to think about star formation in a kind of urban , suburban , and rural context , ” Goodman says .
“ It matters who you are born close to , and it also matters what you mean by ‘ close . ’ ”
Stellar nurseries come in low - and high - mass varieties .
In the high - mass kind , like the great Orion nebula , which is about 1,500 light - years away , stars are packed together like a swarm of bees .
( In our neighborhood of the galaxy , the sun floats alone in a cube about three light - years on a side .
In a high - mass star - forming cluster , thousands of stars occupy the same amount of space . )
More important , high - mass clusters produce high - mass stars — brightly burning nuclear furnaces 10 to 100 times the mass of our sun .
These behemoths live fast and die young .
Our sun will burn for 10 billion years , but high - mass stars are lucky to make it to 10 million .
“ Massive stars have a huge impact on star formation , ” Bally says .
“ They emit powerful winds and a lot of ultraviolet radiation . ”
The winds and UV light tear apart the surrounding gas , carving vast , glowing “ blisters ” that disrupt the cloud .
This turmoil can inhibit other stars from forming — or promote star birth in other regions .
The picture of star formation given to us by infrared telescopes is one of unexpected violence , and it is this violence that is the key to understanding why there are so few stars .
Only over the past decade have astronomers come to understand how common and significant the feedback between stars and their stellar nurseries can be .
“ There is a kind of self - regulation going on , ” Bally says .
“ The stars that form can change their own star - forming environment . ”
The Pillars of Creation in the Eagle nebula ( pictured in one of the most famous images captured by the Hubble Space Telescope ) are one clear example of this feedback .
Like the dense rock spires that form from erosion in a windblown desert , the gaseous pillars in the Eagle nebula have been shaped and compressed by the stellar winds and energetic ultraviolet light from the nebula ’s massive stars .
Spitzer images of the Eagle nebula show that this compression is in turn triggering the formation of new stars within the pillars .
The complex environment in which a star forms affects the creation of planets , too .
In fact , the effect of massive stars on the disks around infant stars — where planets arise — can be deadly .
“ The UV radiation from a massive star will ionize and heat up disks of gas surrounding nearby low - mass stars , ” Bally says .
“ The gas in the disks will then evaporate into space .
It can take a planet 10 million years to form , but the UV radiation from a massive star can burn away the outer part of a disk in just 10,000 years . ”
With their gas depleted , it may be impossible for the disks around stars in massive clusters to form giant planets like Jupiter or Saturn .
It might still be possible for an Earth - like world to form close to a star where the disk is undisturbed , but that point remains debatable .
Massive stars can also cause havoc within a cloud when they die .
At the end of its life , a massive star inevitably explodes as a supernova .
This dumps apocalyptic quantities of energy into the surroundings : A supernova can briefly outshine an entire galaxy .
Supernovas also create all the elements heavier than iron .
With such short lifetimes , massive stars expire close to where they were born , often still within the star - forming region where they began .
Some astronomers have argued that the formation of our sun was triggered by a blast wave from a nearby stellar explosion .
“ There is strong evidence that our own solar system was born near a massive star that went supernova , ” Bally says .
“ Even if our formation was n’t triggered by a supernova , the presence of decay products of certain radioactive elements points to a supernova perhaps seeding the already formed young solar system with enriched elements . ”
This implies that our star was born near the edge of a high - mass cluster — close enough to feel the effects of a supernova , but not so deep inside that our protoplanetary disk was shredded .
The havoc of star - formation feedback is not confined to high - mass clusters .
Low - mass clusters like NGC 1333 ( a nebula and stellar nursery about 1,000 light - years away ) contains only hundreds , rather than thousands , of stars .
Even though no massive stars form in such clusters , the stars there all produce protostellar jets from their accompanying disks , and these , too , can play a dramatic role in shaping a cluster ’s fate .
Spitzer images of NGC 1333 and other low - mass clusters show them threaded with graceful arcs of jet material that extend from one side of these stellar nurseries to the other .
In low - mass clusters , feedback from the jets may play the same disruptive role as do winds and UV radiation from big stars in high - mass clusters .
Unfortunately , we do not yet have enough information to say whether most stars in the galaxy were formed in high - mass or low - mass clusters .
If we knew the answer , we could move closer to estimating how many solar systems like our own exist .
The combined effects of jets , winds , radiation , and supernova explosions show that nature may enforce a kind of celestial family planning .
Stars can beget other stars , but they can also shut down the birthing process .
“ We can see the jets from different stars interacting with each other , ” Arce says .
“ Those outflows can either trigger the formation of new stars or disperse gas that would have been part of the star - formation process . ”
The impact of this stellar birth control is still hotly debated , however .
Some astronomers believe that such internal processes are not the key players in inhibiting star formation .
They say factors external to the cluster , such as shearing forces produced by the galaxy ’s rotation , disrupt the cluster more intensely and prevent stars from forming .
But images from Spitzer have provided stunningly beautiful evidence to support the case for internal processes .
Recent computer simulations have shown how hundreds of jets can act as hypersonic swizzle sticks stirring a cluster ’s gas into turbulent motion that inhibits new stars from forming .
And new studies give added weight to the idea of stellar feedback .
“ With the Complete Survey we nearly tripled the number of outflows we could see impinging on the cloud , ” Goodman says .
As astronomers have investigated the feedback mechanisms that operate in high - and low - mass clusters , there remains a mystery related to the biggest potential star - forming regions of all .
Both low - and high - mass clusters form within larger complexes of gas and dust called giant molecular clouds .
Some of these clouds are dominated by high - mass clusters , others by low - mass clusters , and some have both .
A typical cluster will extend across a few light - years .
Its parent cloud can stretch across 300 light - years and contain enough matter to make a million stars .
But a million stars do not form .
Instead , star formation across a giant molecular cloud is a rather anemic process , and relatively few stellar nurseries arise .
Only 10 percent of the mass of the cloud , on average , is converted through gravitational collapse into stars .
The rest of it never collapses and eventually disperses into the tenuous interstellar medium throughout the galaxy .
What is preventing the vast clouds from collapsing under their own weight ?
Some astronomers believe the answer rests with the powerful magnetic fields that are known to thread the clouds .
Others think galactic shock waves that ripple through them keep the bulk of their gas from collapsing .
Still others say the stellar feedback that astronomers see operating in high - and low - mass clusters is sufficiently powerful to disrupt even the much larger molecular clouds .
“ You have to ask why only 10 percent of the cloud turns into stars , ” Bally says .
“ But we know that star formation adds energy to the system through winds , radiation , and jets .
The supernova blast waves , of course , just add insult to injury . ”
“ If all these stars create turbulence , ” Goodman says , “ then that turbulence acts like a kind of heat that keeps the cloud inflated . ”
The mechanism that prevents giant molecular clouds from collapsing — whatever it may be —has a lot to do with why we exist in the first place .
Stars are factories that convert lightweight elements into heavier atoms .
These atoms include carbon , oxygen , nitrogen , and all the other elements that are essential for life as we know it .
When a star dies , this material is cast into space .
When later generations of stars form , some of that material congeals into rocky planets like Earth .
If galaxies raced through their fuel reserves , creating lots of first - generation stars early on , few stars with rocky planets would be born later .
The odds for life would be much worse .
Earth might very well not even exist .
By looking out to star - forming nurseries across the galaxy , astronomers have shown us something innate and strangely familiar about the birth of our own star and planet .
Psychologists know that in human families the role of siblings can be just as important as that of parents .
Thanks to the Spitzer telescope , the same might now be said of the heavens .
Trends and Policy Issues For The Nexus of Energy and Water
Testimony of Michael E. Webber , Ph.D .
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee , thank you so much for the invitation to speak before your committee on the nexus of energy and water .
My name is Michael Webber , and I am the Associate Director of the Center for International Energy and Environmental Policy and Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin .
I appear here today to share with you my perspective on important trends and policy issues related to this nexus .
My testimony today will make four main points :
1. Energy and water are interrelated ,
2 . The energy - water relationship is already under strain ,
3 . Trends imply these strains will be exacerbated , and
4 . There are different policy actions that can help .
I will briefly elaborate on each of these points during this testimony .
Energy and Water Are Interrelated
Energy and water are interrelated : we use energy for water , and we use water for energy .
For example , we use energy to heat , treat and move water .
Water heating alone is responsible for 9 % of residential electricity consumption in the U.S.
And , nationwide , water and wastewater treatment and distribution combined require about 3 % of the nation ’s electricity .
However , regionally , that number can be much higher .
In California , where water is moved hundreds of miles across two mountain ranges , water is responsible for approximately 15 % of the state ’s total electricity consumption .
Similarly large investments of energy for water occurs wherever water is scarce and energy is available .
In addition to using energy for water , we also use water for energy .
We use water directly through hydroelectric power generation at major dams , indirectly as a coolant for thermoelectric power plants , and as a critical input for the production of biofuels .
The thermoelectric power sector — comprised of power plants that use heat to generate power , including those that operate on nuclear , coal , natural gas or biomass fuels — is the single largest user of water in the United States .
Cooling of power plants is responsible for the withdrawal of nearly 200 billion gallons of water per day .
This use accounts for 49 % of all water withdrawals in the nation when including saline withdrawals , and 39 % of all freshwater withdrawals , which is about the same as for agriculture .
On average , anywhere between 1 to 40 gallons of water is needed for cooling for every kilowatt - hour of electricity that is generated .
However , while power plants withdraw vast amounts of water , very little of that water is actually consumed ; most of the water is returned to the source though at a different temperature and with a different quality .
Thus , while power plants are major users of water , they are not major consumers of water , which is in contrast with the agriculture sector , which consumes all the water it withdraws .
The Energy - Water Relationship Is Already Under Strain
Unfortunately , the energy - water relationship introduces vulnerabilities whereby constraints of one resource introduces constraints in the other .
For example , during the heat wave in France in 2003 that was responsible for approximately 10,000 deaths , nuclear power plants in France had to reduce their power output because of the high inlet temperatures of the cooling water .
Environmental regulations in France ( and the United States ) limit the rejection temperature of power plant cooling water to avoid ecosystem damage from thermal pollution ( e.g. to avoid cooking the plants and animals in the waterway ) .
When the heat wave raised river temperatures , the nuclear power plants could not achieve sufficient cooling within the environmental limits , and so they reduced their power output at a time when electricity demand was spiking by residents turning on their air conditioners .
In this case , a water resource constraint became an energy constraints .
In addition to heat waves , droughts can also strain the energy - water relationship .
During the drought in the southeastern United States in early 2008 , nuclear power plants were within weeks of shutting down because of limited water supplies .
Today in the west , a severe multi- year drought has lowered water levels behind Hoover Dam , introducing the risk that Las Vegas will lose a substantial portion of its drinking water at the same time the dam ’s hydroelectric turbines quit spinning , which would cut off a significant source of power for Los Angeles .
In addition , power outages hamper the ability for the water / wastewater sector to treat and distribute water .
Thus , strain in the energy - water nexus is very real in the United States and is here today .
It is important to note that while constraints in one resource introduce constraints on the other , the corollary of that relationship is also true .
That is , both resources can be enabling for the other : with unlimited energy , we could have unlimited freshwater ; with unlimited water , we could have unlimited energy .
Trends Imply These Strains Will Be Exacerbated
While the energy - water relationship is already under strain today , trends imply that the strain will be exacerbated unless we take appropriate action .
There are four key pieces to this overall trend :
1. Population growth , which drives up total demand for energy and water ,
2. Economic growth , which can drive up per capita demand for both energy and water ,
3. Climate change , which intensifies the hydrological cycle , and
4. Policy choices , whereby we are choosing to move towards more energy - intensive water and more water - intensive energy .
Population Growth Will Put Upward Pressure on Demand for Energy & Water
Population growth over the next few decades might yield another 100 million people in the United States over the next four decades , each of whom will need energy and water to survive and prosper .
This fundamental demographic trend puts upward pressure on demand for both resources , thereby potentially straining the energy - water relationship further .
Economic Growth Will Put Upward Pressure on Per Capita Demand for Energy & Water
On top of underlying trends for population growth is an expectation for economic growth .
Because personal energy and water consumption tend to increase with affluence , there is the risk that the per capita demand for energy and water will increase due to economic growth .
For example , as people become wealthier they tend to eat more meat ( which is very water intensive ) , and use more energy and water to air condition large homes or irrigate their lawns .
Also , as societies become richer , they often demand better environmental conditions , which implies they will spend more energy on wastewater treatment .
However , it ’s important to note that the use of efficiency and conservation measures can occur alongside economic growth , thereby counteracting the nominal trend for increased per capita consumption of energy and water .
At this point , looking forward , it is not clear whether technology , efficiency and conservation will continue to mitigate the upward pressure on per capita consumption that are a consequence of economic growth .
Thus , it ’s possible that the United States will have a compounding effect of increased consumption per person on top of a growing number of people .
Climate Change Is Likely To Intensify Hydrological Cycles
One of the important ways climate change will manifest itself it through an intensification of the global hydrological cycle .
This intensification is likely to mean more frequent and severe droughts and floods along with distorted snowmelt patterns .
Because of these changes to the natural water system , it is likely we will need to spend more energy storing , moving , treating and producing water .
For example , as droughts strain existing water supplies , cities might consider production from deeper aquifers , poorer - quality sources that require desalination , or long - haul pipelines to get the water to its final destination .
Las Vegas , San Diego and Dallas are already considering some version of these options , all of which are extremely energy - intensive .
Desalination in particular is alarming because it is approximately ten times more energy - intensive than production from surface freshwater sources such as rivers and lakes .
Some areas are considering a combination of desalination plus long - haul pipelines , which has a compounding effect for energy use .
Policy Choices Exacerbate Strain in the Energy - Water Nexus
On top of the prior three trends is a policy - driven movement towards more energy - intensive water and water - intensive energy .
We are moving towards more energy - intensive water because of increasingly strict treatment standards for water and wastewater , which requires more energy than traditional approaches that met prior standards .
In addition , instead of a push for water efficiency and conservation , many municipalities are pushing for new supplies of water starting with sources that are farther away and lower quality , and thereby require more energy to get them to the right quality and location .
For a variety of reasons , including the desire to produce a higher proportion of our energy from domestic sources and to decarbonize our energy system , many of our preferred energy choices are more water - intensive .
For example , nuclear energy is produced domestically , but is also more water - intensive than other forms of power generation .
The move towards more water - intensive energy is especially relevant for transportation fuels such as unconventional fossil fuels ( oil shale , coal - to - liquids , gas - to - liquids , tar sands ) , electricity , hydrogen , and biofuels , all of which can require significantly more water to produce than gasoline ( depending on how you produce them ) .
It is important to note that the push for renewable electricity also includes solar photovoltaics and wind power , which require very little water , and so not all future energy choices are worse from a water - perspective .
Almost all unconventional fossil fuels are more water - intensive than domestic , conventional gasoline production .
While gasoline might require a few gallons of water for every gallon of fuel that is produced , the unconventional fossil sources are typically a few times more water - intensive .
Electricity for plug - in hybrid electric vehicles ( PHEVs ) or electric vehicles ( EVs ) are appealing because they are clean at the vehicle ’s end - use and it ’s easier to scrub emissions at hundreds of smokestacks millions of tailpipes .
However , powerplants use a lot of cooling water , and consequently electricity can also be about twice as water - intensive than gasoline per mile traveled if the electricity is generated from the standard U.S. grid .
If that electricity is generated from wind or other water - free sources , then it will be less water - consumptive than gasoline .
Hydrogen can also be more water - intensive than gasoline , depending on how it is produced .
If made from steam methane reforming or electrolysis from water - free electrical sources such as wind , then hydrogen is no worse than gasoline ( and potentially much better ) .
However , if hydrogen is made from electrolysis using electricity from the standard U.S. grid , then producing hydrogen might consume more than 25 gallons of water and withdraw more than 1000 gallons for every gallon of gasoline equivalent energy that is produced .
Though unconventional fossil fuels , electricity and hydrogen are all potentially more water - intensive than conventional gasoline by up to a factor of 10 or so , biofuels are particularly water - intensive .
Growing biofuels consumes more than 1000 gallons of water for every gallon of fuel that is produced .
Sometimes this water is provided naturally from rainfall , however for a non-trivial proportion of our biofuels production , irrigation is used .
Irrigated biofuels from corn or soy can consume twenty or more gallons of water for every mile traveled .
Note that for the sake of analysis and regulation , it is convenient to consider the water requirements per mile traveled .
Doing so incorporates the energy density of the final fuels plus the efficiency of the engines , motors or fuel cells with which they are compatible .
If we compare the water requirements per mile traveled with projections for future transportation miles and combined those figures with mandates for the use of new fuels , such as biofuels , the water impacts are startling .
Water consumption might go up from approximately one trillion gallons of water per year to make gasoline ( with ethanol as an oxygenate ) , to a few trillion gallons of water per year .
To put this water consumption into context , each year the United States consumes about 36 trillion gallons of water .
Consequently , it is possible that water consumption for transportation will more than double from less than 3 % of national use to more than 7 % of national use .
In a time when we are already facing water constraints , it is not clear we have the water to pursue this path .
Essentially we are deciding to switch from foreign oil to domestic water for our transportation fuels , and while that might be a good decision for strategic purposes , I advise that we first make sure we have the water .
There are Different Policy Actions That Can Help
Because there are many rivers , watersheds , basins and aquifers that span several states and / or countries , there is a need for federal engagement on energy - water issues .
Unfortunately , there are some policy pitfalls at the energy - water nexus .
For example , energy and water policymaking are disaggregated .
The funding and oversight mechanisms are separate , and there are a multitude of agencies , committees , and so forth , none of which have clear authority .
It is not unusual for water planners to assume they have all the energy they need and for energy planners to assume they have the water they need .
If their assumptions break down , it could cause significant problems .
In addition , the hierarchy of policymaking is dissimilar .
Energy policy is formulated in a top - down approach , with powerful federal energy agencies , while water policy is formulated in a bottom - up approach , with powerful local and state water agencies .
Furthermore , the data on water quantity are sparse , error - prone , and inconsistent .
The United States Geological Survey ( USGS ) conducted its last survey on water consumption in 1995 and its last published data on water withdrawals are from 2000 .
National databases of water use for power plants contain errors , possibly due to differences in the units , format and definitions between state and federal reporting requirements .
For example , the definitions for water use , withdrawal and consumption are not always clear .
And , water planners in the east use “ gallons ” and water planners in the west use “ acre- feet , ” introducing additional risk for confusion or mistakes .
Despite the potential pitfalls , there are policy opportunities at the energy - water nexus .
For example , water conservation and energy conservation are synonymous .
Policies that promote water conservation also achieve energy conservation .
Policies that promote energy conservation also achieve water conservation .
It is my opinion that robust energy and water policies should begin with conservation because of the cascading cross -over benefits they offer .
Thankfully , the federal government has some effective policy levers at its disposal .
I recommend the following policy actions for the energy - water nexus :
► 1. Collect , maintain and make available accurate , updated and comprehensive water data , possibly through the USGS .
The Department of Energy ’s Energy Information Administration maintains an extensive database of accurate , up - to - date and comprehensive information on energy production , consumption , trade , and price available with temporal and geographic resolution and standardized units .
Unfortunately , there is no equivalent set of data for water .
Consequently , analysts , policymakers and planners lack suitable data to make informed decisions .
► 2. Establish federal oversight for water quantity .
The Environmental Protection Agency has oversight of water quality , but it ’s not clear if any agency has oversight of water quantity .
► 3 . Establish strict standards in building codes for water efficiency .
Building codes should include revised standards for low - flow appliances , water - heating efficiency , purple - piping for reclaimed water , rain barrels and so forth in order to reduce both water and energy consumption .
► 4 . Invest heavily in water - related R&D to match recent increases in energy - related R&D. R&D investments are an excellent policy option for the federal government because state / local governments and industry usually are not in a position to adequately invest in research .
Consequently , the amount of R&D in the water sector is much lower than for other sectors such as pharmaceuticals , technology , or energy .
Furthermore , since energy - related R&D is expected to go through a surge in funding , it would be appropriate from the perspective of the energy - water nexus to raise water - related R&D in a commensurate way .
Topics for R&D include low - energy water treatment , novel approaches to desalination , remote leak detectors for water infrastructure , and air - cooling systems for power plants .
In addition , DoE ’s R&D program for biofuels should emphasize feedstocks such as cellulosic sources or algae that do note require freshwater irrigation .
► 5 . Support the use of reclaimed water at powerplants , industry and agriculture .
Using reclaimed water for powerplants , industry and agriculture spares a significant amount of energy .
However there are financing , regulatory and permitting hurdles in place that restrict this option .
► 6 . Rethink water markets .
Water is widely expected to be free and unlimited , even though water is a limited resource that we should value highly .
Consequently , it is worthwhile to consider implementing water markets that balance our competing needs to meet our social justice and human rights goals ( that is , everyone needs water to survive , whether rich or poor ) , while also meeting our need to discourage water waste through high prices .
Block pricing , whereby the first amount of water usage is cheap or free in order to meet our survival needs , after which the price escalates significantly in order to curtail water use for non-critical purposes , might be a fruitful approach .
The energy - water nexus is a complicated , important issue , and so I am very pleased to know that you are being attentive to the matter .
Mr. Chairman , that concludes my testimony .
I ’ll be pleased to answer questions at the appropriate time .
This is the apartment complex of post- racial America : Yesterday morning a faulty light in 30 Rock star Tracy Morgan 's large aquarium ( home to his pet shark ) set off a small fire in his Upper West Side home .
Morgan was n't there at the time , but the apartment 's sprinkler system ( and the timely arrival of the FDNY ) extinguished the blaze quickly , keeping the fish safe .
Unfortunately , Morgan 's neighbors were n't so lucky .
According to The View's Sherri Shepherd ( a frequent 30 Rock guest star ) , the sprinkler system flooded her apartment .
Shepherd told The New York Post : " I love my husband … he 's my TV husband .
And if any of my clothes got messed up , I 'm sure Tracy will pay for them . "
And if not , perhaps the shark will .

This is already a busy 2009 for the American Civil Liberties Union , always at the ready to jump on perceived church - state issues .
Is the Catholic Church forcing victims of sex trafficking to follow its religious guidelines ?
The Boston Herald says the ACLU makes that accusation in a federal court suit .
According to the complaint , the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services contracted with the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops ( a contract worth more than $ 6 million since 2006 ) to provide services to trafficking victims but also allowed the Church to prohibit subcontractors providing services from providing " referral for abortion services or contraceptive materials . "
The Church views providing such services or referrals for them as cooperating with an " intrinsic evil . "
Sister Mary Ann Walsh , a spokesperson for the USCCB , told the Herald :
We will continue to provide those services in the contract that are consistent with our belief in the life and dignity of the human person . "
Meanwhile , down in Florida , the Pensacola News Journal reports that Santa Rosa County officials have admitted liability in an ACLU lawsuit claiming the officials sponsored school prayer , promoted prayer at school events , even held those events in churches although other facilities were available .
U.S. District Court Judge Casey Rodgers ruled last week after the School Board , the superintendent and the Pace High School principal admitted such actions as teachers and staff preaching about " Judgment Day with the Lord " in high school classrooms and " offering Bible readings and biblical interpretations during student meetings . "
Although those activities are now under injunction , the newspaper story quotes a local resident saying she is saddened because she thinks people can no longer pray in school .
Of course , they can pray and read the Bible in school .
But staff and teachers cannot initiate or lead it or require students to attend prayer or church - related events .
Most school systems got that message years ago .
What 's allowed is spelled out in the News Journal .
My questions tend to focus less on the law than on the individuals who may be affected by these suits :
Miss Vessey said : " One day a little boy came up , he must have been about four and he saw me taking off my ( prosthetic ) legs and he started with the ' why ' questions , you know , ' why have n't you got any legs ' , etc .
Wounded Palestinians pour into overrun hospitals as Israel continues to pound the Gaza Strip in the 10th day of its offensive
Every day , we are tested .
Whether it ’s a cookie tempting us from our diets or a warm bed coaxing us to sleep late , we are forced to decide between what we want to do and what we ought to do .
The ability to resist our impulses is commonly described as self - control or willpower .
The elusive forces behind a person ’s willpower have been the subject of increasing scrutiny by the scientific community trying to understand why some people overeat or abuse drugs and alcohol .
What researchers are finding is that willpower is essentially a mental muscle , and certain physical and mental forces can weaken or strengthen our self - control .
Studies now show that self - control is a limited resource that may be strengthened by the foods we eat .
Laughter and conjuring up powerful memories may also help boost a person ’s self - control .
And , some research suggests , we can improve self - control through practice , testing ourselves on small tasks in order to strengthen our willpower for bigger challenges .
“ Learning self - control produces a wide range of positive outcomes , ’’ said Roy Baumeister , a psychology professor at Florida State University who wrote about the issue in this month ’s Current Directions in Psychological Science .
“ Kids do better in school , people do better at work .
Look at just about any major category of problem that people are suffering from and odds are pretty good that self - control is implicated in some way . ’’
Last month , Dr. Baumeister reported on laboratory studies that showed a relationship between self - control and blood glucose levels .
In one study , participants watched a video , but some were asked to suppress smiles and other facial reactions .
After the film , blood glucose levels had dropped among those who had exerted self - control to stifle their reactions , but stayed the same among the film watchers who were free to react , according to the report in Personality and Social Psychology Review .
The video watchers were later given a concentration test in which they were asked to identify the color in which words were displayed .
The word “ red , ” for instance , might appear in blue ink .
The video watchers who had stifled their responses did the worst on the test , suggesting that their self - control had already been depleted by the film challenge .
But the researchers also found that restoring glucose levels appears to replenish self - control .
Study subjects who drank sugar - sweetened lemonade , which raises glucose levels quickly , performed better on self - control tests than those who drank artificially - sweetened beverages , which have no effect on glucose .
The findings make sense because it ’s long been known that glucose fuels many brain functions .
Having a bite to eat appears to help boost a person ’s willpower , and may explain why smokers trying to quit or students trying to focus on studying often turn to food to sustain themselves .
Consuming sugary drinks or snacks is n’t practical advice for a dieter struggling with willpower .
However , the research does help explain why dieters who eat several small meals a day appear to do better at sticking to a diet than dieters who skip meals .
“ You need the energy from food to have the willpower to exert self - control in order to succeed on your diet , ” said Dr. Baumeister .
Kathleen Vohs , professor of marketing at the University of Minnesota , says that in lab studies , self - control is boosted when people conjure up powerful memories of the things they value in life .
Laughter and positive thoughts also help people perform better on self - control tasks .
Dr. Vohs notes that self - control problems occur because people are caught up “ in the moment ’ ’ and are distracted from their long - term goals .
“ You want to look good in a bikini next summer but you ’re looking at a piece of chocolate cake now , ’’ said Dr. Vohs .
“ When we get people to think about values we move them to the long - term state , and that cools off the tempting stimuli . ’’
Finally , some research suggests that people struggling with self - control should start small .
A few studies show that people who were instructed for two weeks to make small changes like improving their posture or brushing their teeth with their opposite hand improved their scores on laboratory tests of self - control .
The data are n’t conclusive , but they do suggest that the quest for self - improvement should start small .
A vow to stop swearing , to make the bed every day or to give up just one food may be a way to strengthen your self - control , giving you more willpower reserves for bigger challenges later .
“ Learning to bring your behavior under control even with arbitrary rules does build character in that it makes you better able to achieve the things you want to achieve later on , ” said Dr. Baumeister .
“ Self - control is a limited resource .
People make all these different New Year ’s resolutions , but they are all pulling off from the same pool of your willpower .
It ’s better to make one resolution and stick to it than make five . ”
“ The War on drugs fails , and is doomed to perpetual failure , because it is directed not against the root causes of drug addiction and of the international black market in drugs , but only against some drug producers , traffickers and users … the War is doomed because neither the methods of war nor the war idiom itself is appropriate to a complex social problem that calls for compassion , self - searching insight and factually researched scientific understanding . ”
— Dr. Gabor Mate , well known Vancouver physician and author of In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts .
In the early 1930s , The United States was moving towards repealing Prohibition .
In the New Yorker appeared a cartoon that showed a large truck , obviously laden with contraband booze , sailing down the highway with a bumper sticker that said “ DON’T REPEAL , ENFORCE . ”
The booze criminals obviously had more reason to see alcohol prohibited than did the Women ’s Christian Temperance Union , who started it all back in the mid 1800s when Carry Nation busted up saloons with her trusty axe .
During the period of Prohibition , more liquor was sold than ever before .
Smuggling liquor became an art form that made several Vancouver men rich , vaulting them to the top of the social ladder .
I have now been on this planet a remarkable number of years considering how I spent my youth and early manhood and thus have watched the drug scene since the 1940s .
Then , the byword was “ enforce . ”
As , lamentably , it ’s been ever since .
In all those years , the only thing that has n’t been tried has been legalization or decriminalization .
Besotted hypocrites
Our society is , of course , as hypocritical as hell as it peddles well - advertised alcohol , the most dangerous of all drugs .
The cost of alcohol to society is in the billions and even then things like broken homes , single parent families , costs to business operations and so on make it impossible to even come up with an educated guess at the real cost of booze to society .
Yet no one seriously says we should go back to Prohibition and bring back the illegal stills , bootleggers , rum runners and dives or speakeasies that do so well when their product is illegal .
Logically , the legalization or , at least , decriminalization of drugs makes sense .
The beneficiaries of our present system are criminals , the same criminals in large measure who are responsible for the ubiquitous shootings in Vancouver reminiscent of Chicago of the 1920s .
The cost of enforcing drug laws , according to research , is mind boggling .
Federally , 11 departments and agencies spend approximately $ 500 million annually to address illicit drug use in Canada .
Since 1997 , most of the government ’s legislative changes related to illicit drugs have focused on supply reduction ( enforcement ) , not demand reduction .
While estimates vary , the United Nations believes that the annual global sales of illicit drugs are between $ 450 billion and $ 750 billion .
In Canada , the government ’s estimates of sales range from $ 7 billion to $ 18 billion .
For the roughly 50,000 persons charged , 90 per cent of the charges related to cannabis and cocaine .
Cannabis accounted for more than two thirds of the charges , and about half of all charges were for possession .
An estimated 125,000 people in Canada inject drugs .
The economic costs , including health care ( for example , HIV / AIDS and hepatitis ) , lost productivity , property crime and enforcement , are estimated to exceed $ 5 billion annually .
Let me pause here and say that hard numbers are difficult to assess but I quote the above to give readers some idea of what we ’re spending in public money .
No ‘ cure ’ for this disease
If , then , we take the profit motive out of drugs , have we solved our problems ?
Of course not .
Addiction , whether to alcohol or so - called hard and soft drugs , will always plague society .
What it will do is vastly reduce crime .
That is certainly the experience in Holland .
Studies across the EU since 2000 show that The Netherlands ranks seventh in the use of marijuana — after Cyprus Spain , the U.K. , France , Germany and Italy .
The prevalence is similar for other types of drugs .
There is another cost being ignored and it probably can’t be quantified using precise figures as they would include the death , maiming and psychological damage to our soldiers .
The main cash crop for Afghanistan , Burma , Colombia and other countries is drugs .
The Taliban / al Qaeda forces in Afghanistan , who kill our soldiers , are , ironically , partly funded by drug sellers and users in Canada .
If the United States , the EU and Canada decriminalized drugs , those exports would cease .
As I mentioned , Canadians have a thing about drugs and are pretty blasé about alcohol .
I have trouble with the thought that it ’s perfectly legal for one to drink themselves into a stupor yet illegal to use any other drug .
If we were really concerned about alcohol and cigarettes , we ’d treat them as we do cocaine and heroin but we do n’t because we know that banning these substances would increase the supply because the public demand would increase .
Since we know prohibition of “ legal drugs ” would increase smuggling , crime costs and health - related costs , then why do we think that prohibiting other drugs would be any different ?
Rethinking addiction
To embark on a program to decriminalize drugs by taking the profit out requires a plan that deals with health , welfare and education .
It would also take government commitment , a change in law enforcement culture and popular understanding of the solutions proposed and why it would improve our health and reduce gangs and shootings .
I do n’t believe for a moment that if you decriminalized drugs that there would be a massive march into the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver by people wanting to try them , which is the image the enforcers display .
I hate to say this but could it be that the large “ drug enforcement profession ” do n’t want their jobs threatened by taking away their “ clients ” ?
Considering the abject failure , over decades , of enforcement standing alone surely we should try a new approach as Holland has done .
It could hardly make things any worse .

WASHINGTON — Proclaiming a “ once in a generation ” opportunity , President Obama proposed a 10 - year budget on Thursday that reflects his determination in the face of recession to invest trillions of dollars and his own political capital in reshaping the nation ’s priorities .
Mr. Obama would overhaul health care , begin to arrest global warming , expand the federal role in education and shift more costs to some corporations and the wealthiest taxpayers .
In a veiled gibe at the Bush years , Mr. Obama said his budget broke “ from a troubled past ” and attributed the current economic maelstrom to “ an era of profound irresponsibility that engulfed both private and public institutions from some of our largest companies ’ executive suites to the seats of power in Washington , D.C. ”
Without trimming his ambitious campaign promises , the president projects a budget for the 2010 fiscal year of nearly $ 3.6 trillion .
He said he would shrink annual deficits , now at levels not seen in six decades , mostly through higher revenue from rich individuals and polluting industries , by reducing war costs and by assuming a rate of economic growth by 2010 that private forecasters and even some White House advisers consider overly rosy .
When it comes to Tax Resolution and settling debts with government institutions , you ca n’t afford to mess around – but nor can you afford to get in bed with “ sales rooms ” masquerading as a professional tax office .
There ’s simply too much at stake .
And there are too many landmines along the path .

I just watched a segment of Lou Dobbs Tonight talking about the decline in religious belief over the past decade or more , and I am very annoyed with the guests who were chosen and what they said .
The two guests for the piece were blowhard Bill Donahue , President of the Catholic League , and Tony Perkins , President of the vile Family Research Council .
Did anyone actually expect to get a good unbiased view of the subject from these guys ?
Donahue is an enormous ass on the conservative end of the Catholic spectrum , and of course Perkins is off the deep end , and both are very opposed to us and most of what we stand for .
Neither of them was anywhere close to speaking for the 15 % of people who explicitly stated in the American Religious Identification Survey that they were not Christians and not religious .
Apparently 15 % is n’t enough to get a voice on television .
There are enough of us to get religious people on to talk about us and dismiss us , but I guess it ’s too much to ask to have someone who even remotely represents our views there to defend us .
Essentially both of the guests tried to downplay the loss of faith , attempting to claim the large number of non-religious people who are n’t ready yet to say that there is no “ higher power ” as their own , and claiming that due to the bad economy , terrorism and other problems , people are going to come crawling back to them .
Bibles do n’t stop bullets
Where are the miracles ?
Really , on the same show I saw that a man in Illinois had walked into a church , talked to the pastor and then shot and killed him .
The pastor tried to block the shot with his Bible , but of course it failed .
If God ’s most devoted servants can’t hope for his protection in His own house of worship , then where can we hope to see a miracle ?
Maybe we ca n’t expect to see them because they just do n’t happen .
It ’s sad that that point is somewhat true , but the fact that they not only admit that this kind of suffering and hopelessness is what brings people to their business but seem to be proud and smug about it is disgusting .
It ’s like an undertaker rubbing his hands with glee as he hears about a horrible disaster because it will bring him business .
Most personally annoying to me was the fact that they basically dismissed atheists and even agnostics as inconsequential , and they could do it because none of us were there to defend ourselves .
They may not admit it , but they must know that the people who have fallen away from religion may very well end up as atheists or permanent agnostics , especially if we are brave and open enough to present our side , and they should know that there are many of us out there .
If you are an atheist or agnostic , or if you have any other minority view on gods and the supernatural , please do n’t keep it to yourself .
The majority needs to be challenged , and the people who are on the fence need to be informed about the serious debate on these subjects , not just indoctrinated by a new church without ever knowing another way is out there .
Let ’s show people like Bill Donahue and Tony Perkins that we actually are out here , and that we will not be ignored and stepped on by them and their ultra-conservative religious agendas anymore .

Black holes are objects with such incredible mass and strong gravitational fields that visible light can't escape them .
Often , astronomers can perceive black holes because they are sucking gas from neighboring stars , and then spitting energy back out in the invisible , super - hot x-ray region of the spectrum .
While we understand black holes far better than we did even a decade ago , there is still no conclusive theory that explains why black holes exist or how , exactly , they function .
Their mystery is part of what makes them such a tantalizing subject of science illustration - as well as science fiction film and art .

There has been talk of war with Iran going back several years now , mostly with Israel initiating and various AIPAC - supported US politicians nodding sagely in agreement .
But the fly in the ointment has always been Russia , which is not only actually building Iran 's power station but has a mutual defense contract with its 7th largest trading partner .
Putin has made it very clear that in the event of war , Russia will support Iran at least logistically .
In November of 2007 , both American and Israeli support and training to Georgia increased significantly , along with pressuer for Georgia to clamp down on the breakaway regions .
This led to the thankfully brief war between Russia and Georgia in August of 2008 .
In hindsight , it appears the strategic thinking had been to create a prolonged border conflict along the Caucasus Mountains , in order to limit Russia 's ability to supply Iran by convoy thruogh the tunnels under the mountains .
If that was the plan , it failed miserably as Russia blew through the Goergian forces as if they were wet kleenex .
More than likely Putin realized the real issuer and decided to send a message .
In any event , no sooner had it bome obvious that the passes throough Georgia would remain open then talk of an attack on Iran began to fade from the media , and talk of going into Pakistan began to appear , even ahead of November 's convenient " terrorist " attack in Mumbai .
As we approached the anniversary of September 11th , there was concern that there might be another attack of some kimd possibly false - flag to spur the nation onto yet another war .
And it now appears that there may have indeed been one after all !
On January 27th , 2009 , Representive Paul Kanjorski ( D - PA ) , Chairman of the Capitol Markets Subcommitee , was answering questions on C - SPAN .
At 2:20 the big ugly secret came out .
There had been an electronic run on the banks in Mid-September .
Within an hour , some $ 550 billion was electronically withdrawn from the money market accounts .
The claim is that had the government not blocked further withdrawals and stared offering guarantees , the US and World economies would have been collapsed .
Kanjorski gives the date as " Around " September 15th , then mentions that the activity took place on Thursday .
The Thursday before the 15th was September 11th .
Now , had our enemies in wealthy Arab nations brought our banking system to the edge of collapse , we would have heard about it the day that it happened .
But prior to Kanjorski's admission on C - Span , from September 11th 2008 to Januray 27th , 2009 , not a word of the intentional attack on the US economy appeared in the corporate media .
Even after Kanjorski's admission , ABCNNBBCBS remains ominously silent .
Just two weeks after this financial attack , any reporters that might have been looking into it were distracted as Israel attacked Gaza and kicked off a very news - worthy invasion .
Meanwhile , rather than aknowledge the attack , the US Government threatened Congress into looting the taxpayers to make up the lost funds .
And now we are seeing a ramping up of the pressure to invade Iran again .
So , from here it looks like we may have dodged another false - flag attack on September 11th .
But with that attack came a warning that whoever was behind it would try it again if certain foreign policy demands were not met .
Which would explain why the Obama administration is promoting the already - discredited claims of an Iranian threat put forward by his predecessor , and why his staff is dominated by strong supporters of Israel .

Rove says he wo n't comply with congressional subpoenas John Byrne
Published : Thursday February 5 , 2009
Print This Email This Lawyer signals Rove cooperating with Justice Dept. Former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove " wo n't comply " with congressional subpoenas , according to a newspaper report of an event held in Los Angeles earlier this week .
Rove spoke Tuesday evening at Loyola Marymount University , a Jesuit institution in Los Angeles , as part of the school 's " First Amendment Week . "
" One man loudly denounced Rove as a ' traitor ' before he was escorted out , " the Loyola Daily Breeze noted .
" A woman held up a pair of handcuffs and said she would like to see Rove wearing them . "
Rove mounted a " sprited defense " of Bush policies : warrantless wiretapping , Guantanamo Bay and so - called harsh interrogations .
But among the questions bearing relevance on Rove 's current predicament -- one answer stood out .
One questioner asked Rove whether he would comply with Congressional
subpoenas .
Rove was subpoenaed last month to testify to the House Judiciary Committee about his knowledge surrounding the firings of US Attorneys and the prosecution of former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman .
Rove " said he would not , and cited Janet Reno , President Clinton 's attorney general , as his authority in resisting Congressional infringements on executive privilege . "
His answer seems to contrast the sentiment of his Rove 's lawyer , Robert Luskin , who told an investigative reporter earlier this week that Rove was cooperating with two Justice Department probes into the US Attorney firings and the Siegelman case .
" I can say that he would cooperate with the [ Justice Department ] investigation if asked , " Luskin said .
He made no such specific commitment to an investigation by the House Judiciary Committee , or the Senate Judiciary Committee , both of which have subpoenaed him to testify on the cases .
Luskin told Raw Story Thursday that while he had n't seen the specific remarks , he was " confident that I 've accurately expressed his position in this matter and it's consistent with what I have conveyed to [ House Judiciary Chairman ] Conyers and to the White House . "
Rove also told the Los Angeles crowd that media coverage leading up to the election was " unbelievably tilted toward Obama , " and " not healthy for the system . "
" That coverage is putting a finger on the scale , " Rove said , adding that most members of the national press corps live in Washington and New York and went to schools with a liberal bent .
The following video is Karl Rove 's response to a Loyola Marymount University student when asked about the subpoena issued to him by House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers Jr. on Tuesday , Feb.

Wellness Wednesday - Opposite but not equal
An old children 's riddle goes something like this , " What weighs more ... five pounds of feathers or five pounds of rocks ? "
Of course , this easily fools 5 - year - olds and feeble - minded newsletter editors , as five pounds are five pounds -- be they feathers or rocks .
But it also leads to another question , which packs more punch ?
( EDITOR'S NOTE :
Hit me with the feathers , please ! )
In a bit of a twist on the riddle , consider the picture below , which features models commonly used by Jayme Nekuda , director of the UNMC Employee Benefits and Work - Life Programs Division of Human Resources and UNMC 's wellness manager , to illustrate what five pounds of fat looks like compared to five pounds of muscle .
The red muscle model shows tissue that is lean , dense and metabolically active , which means it burns energy ( and fat ) even while at rest .
The fat meanwhile is obtuse , unruly and basically useless , unless one exercises enough to burn it as energy .
The benefits of increased muscle mass are many as are the health dangers of having excess body fat .
So when it comes to these two substances , the riddle is easy to solve , only muscle truly packs a punch .

Apple may be working on more effective wireless battery management systems for personal electronic devices , with a Mac serving as the hub , according to newly discovered company filings .
A trio of patent requests published by the United States Patent and Trademark Office this week describe intelligent , universal , and rechargeable batteries that would be capable of powering a plethora of devices like cell phones , wireless keyboards and mice , speakers , mp3 players , PDAs , laptop computers , microphones , headphones , and headsets .
With a global shift towards portable computing , consumers are using more and more wireless devices interconnected through infrared , Bluetooth , and ultra - wide - band , the filings note .
" One problem often encountered by a user of a wireless personal area network is the constant need to re-charge or replace the batteries of the wireless devices , " Apple wrote .
" Not only is this inconvenient , but it can also decrease productivity .
When a critical device such as a wireless mouse or wireless keyboard runs out of power , a user may have to wait until the device is charged ... to use the computer wirelessly again . "
The patent applications go on to propose a system for battery management where the Mac takes a central role .
Desktops and portables would have battery charging slots built in and serve as the host for the entire system .
Low batteries would send an alert to the host machine , leading it to inform the user which battery needs to be recharged or replaced , directing the user toward a specific charging slot for a compatible , charged battery .
Alerts would be sent early enough so users can save settings or any other work before an imminent power shutoff , the filings note .
In locations where there are networked Macs , the system might recommend host machines in other floors , halls , groups or departments if they have fully charged compatible batteries in their slots .
Apple implies that the host computer would be capable of controlling the rate of charge to maximize overall battery life or maximize the energy charged .
A detailed charging history , including number of charge cycles and how many were " fast " or " slow " , could be accessed direct from the battery .
The host system would also be capable of automatically initiating a reconditioning charge after a certain number of cycles to ensure optimum performance , the company said .
Each universal battery would include built - in circuitry to communicate with the device it 's connected to before it ever begins to discharge .
After an agreed amount of power is negotiated , the battery would provide power at the precise level needed .
By negotiating the minimum amount of power required by the device , battery life could be maximized , the filings explain .
If negotiation fails or an accidental short occurs , a safety shutoff would automatically disconnect the battery core from the battery terminals , avoiding major damage or power drain .
When the time comes for the battery to finally be replaced , the host would direct the user to a website to place an order .
As an incentive to return the old battery , users would be eligible to earn recycling credits .
Just after October 6 , 2008 , when Iceland effectively went bust , I spoke to a man at the International Monetary Fund who had been flown in to Reykjavík to determine if money might responsibly be lent to such a spectacularly bankrupt nation .
He ’d never been to Iceland , knew nothing about the place , and said he needed a map to find it .
He has spent his life dealing with famously distressed countries , usually in Africa , perpetually in one kind of financial trouble or another .
Iceland was entirely new to his experience : a nation of extremely well - to - do ( No. 1 in the United Nations ’ 2008 Human Development Index ) , well - educated , historically rational human beings who had organized themselves to commit one of the single greatest acts of madness in financial history .
“ You have to understand , ” he told me , “ Iceland is no longer a country .
It is a hedge fund . ”

An entire nation without immediate experience or even distant memory of high finance had gazed upon the example of Wall Street and said , “ We can do that . ”
For a brief moment it appeared that they could .
In 2003 , Iceland ’s three biggest banks had assets of only a few billion dollars , about 100 percent of its gross domestic product .
Over the next three and a half years they grew to over $ 140 billion and were so much greater than Iceland ’s G.D.P. that it made no sense to calculate the percentage of it they accounted for .
It was , as one economist put it to me , “ the most rapid expansion of a banking system in the history of mankind . ”
At the same time , in part because the banks were also lending Icelanders money to buy stocks and real estate , the value of Icelandic stocks and real estate went through the roof .
From 2003 to 2007 , while the U.S. stock market was doubling , the Icelandic stock market multiplied by nine times .
Reykjavík real - estate prices tripled .
By 2006 the average Icelandic family was three times as wealthy as it had been in 2003 , and virtually all of this new wealth was one way or another tied to the new investment - banking industry .
“ Everyone was learning Black - Scholes ” ( the option - pricing model ) , says Ragnar Arnason , a professor of fishing economics at the University of Iceland , who watched students flee the economics of fishing for the economics of money .
“ The schools of engineering and math were offering courses on financial engineering .
We had hundreds and hundreds of people studying finance . ”
This in a country the size of Kentucky , but with fewer citizens than greater Peoria , Illinois .
Peoria , Illinois , does n’t have global financial institutions , or a university devoting itself to training many hundreds of financiers , or its own currency .
And yet the world was taking Iceland seriously .

The private - sector student loan industry would be dealt a major blow under the federal 2010 budget proposed by President Barack Obama on Thursday .
Shares in Sallie Mae , the nation ’s largest student loan group , fell sharply on Obama ’s proposal to shift all federal student loans into the so - called direct - loan program administered by the U.S. Department of Education .
The budget for fiscal 2010 , which begins on October 1 , said it would save more than $ 4 billion annually by ending “ entitlements ” for financial institutions that lend to students .
“ Right now , the subsidies in the government - guaranteed student loan program are set by the Congress through the political process .
That program has not only needlessly cost taxpayers billions of dollars , but has also subjected students to uncertainty because of turmoil in the financial markets , ” the budget document said .
The change , subject to review by Congress , could spell the end of the Federal Family Education Loan Program , a source of revenues for years for many student loan groups .
“ President Obama proposes that , beginning in 2010 - 2011 , all new student loans would be originated through the direct student loan program , ” said California Democratic Rep.
George Miller , chairman of the House education committee , in a statement praising the president ’s proposal .
Shares in Sallie Mae , known formally as SLM Corp , were down $ 3.29 or 39 percent at $ 5.10 each in midday New York Stock Exchange trading after dipping as low as $ 4.72 earlier .

Using a ladder , the bather climbs in through an opening on top of the machine , which stands about 2 meters ( 6 ft ) tall .
Once the desired water temperature is set and the main switch is activated , the pre-rinse cycle starts , spraying the user with jets of hot water for 5 minutes .

Farmers across the tropics might raze forests to plant biofuel crops , according to new research by Holly Gibbs , a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford ’s Woods Institute for the Environment .
“ If we run our cars on biofuels produced in the tropics , chances will be good that we are effectively burning rainforests in our gas tanks , ” she warned .
Policies favoring biofuel crop production may inadvertently contribute to , not slow , the process of climate change , Gibbs said .
Such an environmental disaster could be “ just around the corner without more thoughtful energy policies that consider potential ripple effects on tropical forests , ” she added .
Gibbs ’ predictions are based on her new study , in which she analyzed detailed satellite images collected between 1980 and 2000 .
The study is the first to do such a detailed characterization of the pathways of agricultural expansion throughout the entire tropical region .
Gibbs hopes that this new knowledge will contribute to making prudent decisions about future biofuel policies and subsidies .
Gibbs will present her findings in Chicago on Saturday , Feb. 14 , during a symposium that begins at 1:30 p.m. CT at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science .
The symposium is titled “ Biofuels , Tropical Deforestation , and Climate Policy : Key Challenges and Opportunities . ”
She will participate in a press conference at 12 p.m. CT on the same day .
With climates ideal for growing biofuel crops and an abundance of arable land , tropical countries such as Brazil , Indonesia and Malaysia have already responded to growing demand for food , feed and fuel from crops such sugarcane , soy and oil palm by increasing their production , Gibbs said .
For example , the area of cropland dedicated to soybean production in Brazil has increased at a rate of nearly 15 percent per year since 1990 , and Indonesia ’s oil palm production tripled during the 1990’s and then doubled again from 2000 to 2007 , said Gibbs .
These increases are due in part to soaring global demand for food and feed .
However , scientists have reason to suspect that biofuels also are playing a significant role in recent cropland expansion .
“ Biofuels have caused alarm because of how quickly production has been growing : Global ethanol production increased by four times and biodiesel by 10 times between 2000 and 2007 , ” Gibbs said .
“ Moreover , agricultural subsidies in Indonesia and in the United States are providing added incentives to increase production of these crops . ”
“ The crops that are most prized as current - generation biofuels , such as oil palm and sugarcane , also are those crops most suited to tropical countries , ” she added .
Land expansion controversy
Before Gibbs ’ study , few had focused on the question of the origin of new croplands — a question that has been a source of heated debate among scientists and policymakers alike over the past few years .
“ Biofuel producers typically indicate that they are establishing new soy fields or oil palm plantations on degraded or already cleared lands , ” Gibbs said , “ while environmental groups and some scientists point to Amazonian rainforests or Southeast Asian peat swamps as the land sources . ”
Gibbs was one of the first to approach the question by quantifying the types of land — pristine forest , disturbed forest , woody savannas , grasslands , plantations or agricultural land — that are being cleared to make space for the new cropland .
“ If biofuels are grown in place of forests , we ’re actually going to end up emitting a huge amount of carbon .
When trees are cut down to make room for new farmland , they are usually burned , sending their stored carbon to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide .
That creates what ’s called a carbon debt , ” Gibbs said .
“ This is because the carbon lost from deforestation is much greater than the carbon saved from using the current - generation biofuels . ”
Indeed , tropical forests are the world ’s most efficient storehouses for carbon , harboring more than 340 billion tons , according to Gibbs ’ research .
This is equivalent to more than 40 years worth of global carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels .
Gibbs ’ previous findings asserted that the carbon debt incurred from cutting down a tropical forest could take several centuries or even millennia to repay through carbon savings produced from the resultant biofuels .
On the other hand , planting biofuel croplands on degraded land — land that has been previously cultivated but is now providing very low productivity due to salinity , soil erosion , nutrient leaching , etc. — could have an overall positive environmental impact , Gibbs said .
“ In a sense that would be restoring the land to a higher potential to provide environmental services for people , ” she added .
Both Brazil and Indonesia contain significant areas of degraded land — in Brazil , the total area may be as large as California — that could be replanted with crops , thereby decreasing the burden on forested land .
“ But this is challenging without new policies or economic incentives to encourage establishing crops on these lands , ” Gibbs said .
This is because farmers who convert degraded land to cropland must shoulder the costs of fertilizer and learn improved soil management practices to make the lands productive , whereas farmers who clear forested land often avoid these burdens .
“ Government subsidies , environmental certification schemes or carbon markets could provide incentives to grow crops on degraded rather than forest lands , ” Gibbs said .
However , in some cases , allowing the degraded land to be returned to its natural , forested state might be the wisest use of the land , absorbing more carbon and providing ecological services such as flood mitigation , rainwater recycling and habitat for endangered species , Gibbs said .
“ There are tradeoffs in all these decisions that need to be made on a case - by - case basis , ” she said .
“ We need to keep in mind that more cropland will be needed to meet the global demands for food , feed and fuel , so the best options will likely vary by circumstance . ”
Analyzing changing lands
The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization ( FAO ) maintains a database of detailed satellite images taken over the last 20 years through the Global Forest Resources Assessment , an initiative that dates back to 1946 .
The FAO releases a new global assessment every 10 years .
Working closely with the FAO , Gibbs analyzed satellite data for more than 100 randomly selected sites across the tropics .
By comparing satellite images taken of each specific site in 1980 , 1990 and 2000 , Gibbs was able to clearly see whether croplands were expanding , and if so , what they were replacing .
She examined more than 600 satellite images from the FAO and other organizations , and noticed a clear trend : “ What we found was that indeed forests were the primary source for new croplands as they expanded across the tropics during the 1980s and 1990s .
So cropland expansion , whether it ’s for fuel , feed or food , has undoubtedly led to more deforestation , and evidence is mounting that this trend will continue . ”
For example , Gibbs ’ data show that between 1980 and 2000 , more than half of new cropland came from intact rainforests and another 30 percent from disturbed forests , “ This is contrary to what some biofuel proponents have suggested is occurring today , ” she said .
“ This is a major concern for the global environment , ” Gibbs said .
“ As we look toward biofuels to help reduce climate change we must consider the rainforests and savannas that may lie in the pathway of expanding biofuel cropland . ”
The FAO is in the process of collecting and interpreting the data for the current decade .
“ This will be important to provide more recent information about expansion of croplands occurring in the midst of the biofuels boom , ” Gibbs said .
Although Gibbs recognizes that biofuels have certain drawbacks , including those documented in her study , she is not opposed to their regulated use .
“ I think that biofuels may have a critical place in our future energy plan , ” she said .
“ But the way that we ’re currently going about producing biofuels could have a lot of unintended consequences . ”
“ The new administration should carefully consider the full consequences of any energy plan to make sure we protect the carbon stored in rainforests as well as reduce our fossil fuel emissions , ” she said .
US ' war on terror ' eroded rights worldwide : experts Agence France - Presse
Published : Monday February 16 , 2009
Print This Email This President Barack Obama 's new administration presents a unique chance for Washington to remedy human rights violations committed in its anti-terror efforts , a rights report said Monday .
" The change in US administration provides a unique opportunity for change , " the International Commission of Jurists ( ICJ ) said in its report , " Assessing Damage , Urging Action . "
" In the course of this inquiry , we have been shocked by the extent of the damage done over the past seven years by excessive or abusive counter - terrorism measures in a wide range of countries around the world , " said ICJ member Arthur Chaskalson , former chief justice of South Africa .
" Seven years after 9/11 it is time to take stock and to repeal abusive laws and policies enacted in recent years , " said ICJ President Mary Robinson , a former UN human rights commissioner and president of Ireland .
" Human rights and international humanitarian law provide a strong and flexible framework to address terrorist threats , " she added .
" It is now absolutely essential that all states restore their commitment to human rights and that the United Nations takes on a leadership role in this process .
If we fail to act now , the damage to international law risks becoming permanent . "
The report focussed on abuses committed by states in the " war against terrorism , " a phrase that it appealed for the international community to reject .
" The present political climate may provide one of the last chances for a concerted international effort to take remedial measures and restore long - standing international norms , " the ICJ added .
The report was damning in its assessment of the United States ' counter - terrorism measures , accusing it and other leading liberal democracies of having " actively undermined " international law .
" The panel found that the framework of international law is being actively undermined , and many states are reneging on their treaty or customary law obligations , " said the group .
The report , which covers over 40 countries , looked at instances of people being tortured in secret prisons as well as others held for extended periods without access to the external world , including lawyers and courts .
Teacher : Wrong Computer Click Ruined My Life Teacher Julie Amero faced charges after spyware caused porn to show on her PC .
Jan. 27 , 2009  --
In 2004 Julie Amero was a 37 - year - old substitute teacher who looked forward to the impending birth of her first child and enjoyed educating students .
But her life took a drastic turn on Oct. 19 of that year and now , four years later , Amero has a scarred reputation and said she has suffered emotional distress after facing serious pornography charges that destroyed her teaching career .
" Everybody out there should be afraid , " the now 42 - year - old Amero said on " Good Morning America " today .
" If it can happen to me it can certainly happen to you . "
The Back Story : Spyware Cause Porn Popups on Teacher 's Computer
Amero started that fateful school day at Kelly Middle School in Norwich , Conn. , by checking her personal e-mail and then she stepped out of the classroom to use the bathroom .
While she was away from her desk , the computer began displaying a flurry of pornographic images .
She returned to find two students giggling at the computer screen .
Amero said she tried to close the inappropriate images , but to no avail .
" The pop-ups never went away .
It was one after another .
They were continuous .
Every time I clicked the box in the corner , the red box , the red X , more were generated , " she said according to a court transcript .
For several hours she says she tried to get the images of " women in lingerie , bathing suits " and more to stop .
What Amero did n't do , though , was shut down the computer .
" I did n't even know where the button was , " she said , " never been shown , never been told . "
Amero said she was n't computer savvy and had limited knowledge of how to use the device .
" [ My husband ] had just taught me recently how to do the computer , " Amero said .
She alerted the school 's vice principal about the incident on her break and the administrator initially told her not to worry .
But then several angry parents who learned of the incident from their children called the school to complain .
" I knew there was a problem the third day at the end of that school day , " Amero said .
" At the time no big deal was made of it .
Then kids went home , told their parents and it exploded from there , " said Hartford Courant newspaper columnist Rick Green , who has followed the case .
The school notified police and told Amero she could never work as a substitute teacher again .
Shortly afterward she was arrested on 10 counts of risk of injury to a minor .
A Wrongful Guilty Verdict
Eventually , authorities dropped six of the counts , but Amero still faced four and a total of 40 years in prison .
" It 's a fascinating glimpse into what can happen to you if you are arrested in a wrongful situation , " Green said .
Prosecutors claimed that Amero had been surfing pornography Web sites in the seventh - grade classroom .
They offered her a deal that would have expunged the charges from her record after two years of good behavior .
Amero refused the deal and maintained her innocence .
In the 2007 trial , Amero was convicted , but computer experts following the case disagreed with the verdict .
After their outcry , prosecutors sent the computer 's hard drive to state police forensics laboratory where analysis found evidence that contradicted the state 's expert witness .
" This Web page that she had allegedly clicked on , which had been presented at the trial as evidence , clear evidence by the prosecution , everything indicated to the exact contrary that she had not clicked on that link , " said Sunbelt Software CEO Alex Eckelberry , who came to Amero 's aid after reading about her case in the newspaper .
Combatting the Conviction
The bevy of computer experts that came to Amero 's aid proved that the true culprit of the pornographic pop-ups was a malicious spyware program .
The evidence was so compelling that a judge overturned Amero 's conviction , saying the prosecution 's star witness , a computer forensics expert , had given false testimony .
But for 18 months prosecutors pondered whether they should retry the former educator .
They dropped the felony charges , but in November 2008 Amero pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct .
She can never work in a classroom again .
She said the plea bargain was the result of not wanting to spend more time in a courtroom because the entire ordeal had taken a serious toll on her health .
" They got a pound of flesh , " said Amero , who remains unemployed and says she 's unable to get work thanks to the ordeal .
" The doctors all agreed that I would not make it through another trial . "
Amero said the stress of the trial caused a miscarriage and prompted breathing troubles .
Her husband , 57 - year - old Wes Vello , said he sees the plea agreement as the state 's way of being inflexible .
" They were unwilling to admit they 'd made a mistake , " said Vello , who works seven days a week as a shipbuilder .
" In my opinion it was just a saving face for the state . "
Dollar is " Absolutely Doomed "
With promises of more U.S. government intervention , we are going to be in a situation of hyperinflation and a dollar that is absolutely doomed , warns Kirby Daley , senior strategist at the Newedge Group .

Excerpt : ' You : Being Beautiful ' on the Biology of Sex Read an excerpt of Dr. Oz 's book that delves into the biology of sex .
March 9 , 2009  --
In the book he co-wrote with Michael Roizen , Dr. Mehmet Oz takes a look at beauty in all its aspects .
" You : Being Beautiful " is an " owners manual " to discovering inner and outer beauty and lends advice for work , love and life .
In the excerpt below , Oz takes a look at the biology of sex and the scientific side of what gets men and women all hot and bothered .

The Biology of Sex
Humans are the most sexual species around .
How do we know ?
( The answer is not from National Geographic specials . )
One example : Women are sexually active for almost their entire lives and throughout all times of their menstrual cycle — meaning that they can choose to have sex even during times when they are physiologically unable to produce offspring .
That means that sex must have some higher purpose and function than simply reproduction .
Another :
Sex drive does not need to decrease with age , meaning that we strongly desire the physical connection even after we 're unable to bear children .
What 's that higher purpose ?
For one , sex can serve as that nirvana moment between couples — a time when you feel complete happiness and intimacy , a time when you express your love to your mate .
In other words , sex is designed to make you feel good .
Real , real good .
How good ?
For starters , consider that :
Men who have sex three times a week can decrease their risk of heart attack and stroke by 50 percent .
Women who enjoy sex tend to live longer than those who do n't .
Great sex makes your body feel and be the equivalent of two to eight years younger — same for men who have 150 to 350 orgasms a year , compared to the average of once per week .
Having orgasms seems also to help decrease general pain .
Increasing sex from once a month to once a week , according to researchers , is the happiness equivalent of an additional $ 50,000 in income for the typical American .
It 's also interesting to look at the gender - based evolutionary functions of sex .
Thousands of years ago , the woman felt that it was her job to grow the species and raise the children , so she needed someone who could protect the family .
Her body responded better to intimacy ( she provided that intimacy so that men could help her reach orgasm ) .
A man had different intentions .
When he saw a bunch of marauders marching through camp , he would get aroused by the threat to his family and mate — a signal that his sperm needed to beat out other men's sperm .
So a man responds sexually to anxiety , risk , and excitement , in contrast to a woman 's desire for intimacy .
That hard - wired difference is one way to explain the different ways that men and women feel aroused — and it 's the basis for helping you figure out how to better mesh the sexual preferences and differences in your own relationships so that you do n't only go through the motions when it comes to sex but also experience the emotions .
While you may think that the biggest sex organ of all is one that 's covered up by the latest style from Jockey or Victoria 's Secret , your brain is actually your biggest sex organ .
Some researchers have said that sexual thoughts , for example , go through a man 's brain once every 52 seconds and through a woman 's only once a day .
And even conservative researchers say that men have many more sexual thoughts than women do .
Perhaps that 's because men have 2.5 times the amount of brain space devoted to sexual drive that women do ( or because women have more important things to think about ) .
Sex , of course , is more than just thinking about it ; it 's also about craving it .
That craving originates in a part of the brain called the insula .
Blocking messages to the insula is one of the ways that cigarette cessation techniques work — good news for many , they do n't block sexual craving messages ; in fact , bupropion , the drug we most often use in our breathe - free program with nicotine , actually increases libido in most people .
The insula ( remember it from chapter 8 ? ) , a primitive area of the brain , is especially active in women who have more frequent orgasms .
Let 's now look at the way men and women biologically work when it come to sex :
WOMEN : During sex , your pupils dilate , nostrils flare , heart rate increases , oxytocin level increases , sweat glands open for cooling , breasts enlarge by 25 percent , and nipples increase in height by half an inch .
Infrared cameras also show increased blood flow to the lips , nose , and labia .
All of these things happen as the sexual stimuli build up to the almighty orgasm ( see Figure 10.3 ) .
A good question to ask right about now :
Why do women have orgasms ?
Evolutionarily , it was one of the ways that women could tell whether a man would be a good lifelong partner , because it could help women distinguish between a caring , patient male and a selfish or impatient one .
Nevertheless , female orgasm can be so subtle that some women do n't even know when they 've had one .
Here 's what happens :
During intercourse , your vaginal walls make fluids that let your partner 's penis slide with just the right amount of friction .
Together with the sights , sounds , and smells of sex , the stimulation to the clitoris , labia , and breasts all builds up a crescendo of intense physical sensation .
This is about the time when your brain tells your vagina and nearby muscles to contract .
Why ?
To bring his penis in deeper and increase the chance of his sperm hitting its target — the egg .
In the process , some women even ejaculate .
During orgasm , the uterus dips in like an anteater and sucks up the semen into the uterus to further increase the chance of fertilization .
The female orgasm also causes hormones to increase contractions in the vagina and uterus and help move semen into the uterus ( women who orgasm between 1 minute before and 45 minutes after their partner 's ejaculation have a higher tendency to retain sperm compared to those who do n't have an orgasm ) .
The female orgasm , of course , is n't an easy thing to describe .
The brain serves as the main conductor in this symphony , but it might involve many different instruments , sometimes including the area known as the G - spot , which is parallel to a gathering of nerves on the male prostate .
Women usually do not have a single spot like some magic sex - me - here button but rather a region of nerves like those spread over the surface of the male prostate .
That 's because as a woman 's reproductive organs develop in utero , her rudimentary prostate moves away so these nerves end up on the vaginal wall .
So if you insert your index finger upward into the vagina and make the " come here " movement , you will touch the G - spot region that exists in some women .
The region is often not that sensitive either , but you never know until you try .
The fact that women can be stimulated to orgasm through not only the genitals but also the mouth , nipples , and other parts of the body points to the complexity of the system — and reinforces the fact that the true biology of sex really evolves within the brain .
( One theory is that sexual stimuli are carried from the cervix and uterus to the brain through the vagus nerve — one of the nerves stimulated during deep breathing and meditation . )
MEN : If you allow us a few moments to talk about the male anatomy , we think you 'll be pretty amazed .
Biologically , men 's sexual organs are much different than those of other species .
For one , a man 's penis does n't have a bone , unlike those of other species .
Why ?
The bone makes for easy and fast access for males in the animal kingdom ( to inseminate their partners quickly ) ; men give up the bone but gain a disproportionately large penis for their body size in return .
The evolutionary implications :
One , men use the penis as a tool of attraction , implying that women do place some value in using it as a diagnostic for evaluating potential mates ( not so overtly these days ) .
And two , the lack of bone implies that men do equate emotions with sex , since they must be aroused for an erection ; instead of easy and fast access , which can be painful to the females , it takes more care to have a sexual relationship between two people .
Another interesting observation : Humans have proportionally smaller testicles than males in other species ; that 's because other species need to ejaculate more semen to fertilize partners who are in heat prior to other males of the tribe and ensure propagation of their genes .
Human males do n't need the size because of the biological drive to be monogamous ( at least serially ) .
Now , it does n't take a sexologist to know the purpose of the male orgasm :
Find the egg , fertilize the egg , begin shopping for Barbies .
But what 's interesting is that this mad dash to the egg is n't some New York City marathon where all the starter sperm strap on their Nikes with the goal of making it to the finish line .
Some of the sperm do that , but others are more like defensive linemen .
Their job : to stop other men's sperm from scoring .
Some sperm even have a dual role — blocking other sperm but allowing their own sperm with their genes to penetrate more effectively .
Now , during a man 's orgasm , the brain is firing like a lit - up pinball machine , causing contractions in most muscles of the body .
The purpose : Like a woman's , these contractions help increase the chance of pregnancy by enabling the penis to penetrate as deeply as possible .
The glands that make semen , mostly the prostate , squeeze repeatedly , propelling sperm as deep and as far as possible .
The prostate , by the way , is often referred to as the male G - spot , because it 's made up of some of the same types of tissues as some of the spots identified around the nerve plexus that is the G - spot in women and can be stimulated in a similar fashion by some adventuresome couples .
Normally , ejaculation cannons semen forward through a man 's urethra and out the tip of his penis .
Semen , by the way , contains hormones like oxytocin that also have a feel - good effect on women .
The reason ejaculation never gets mixed up with urine is that there 's a tiny muscle at the entrance of the bladder that prevents semen from slipping backward or urine from propelling forward during orgasm ( it 's a roadblock of sorts , so the only way for the semen to go is out ) .
Now , some men suffer from what 's called retrograde ejaculation , in which that tiny muscle does n't work right , causing semen to backtrack into the bladder rather than to the promised land ( causes for this include some side effects of surgery or medication ) .
Retrograde ejaculation does n't affect a man 's ability to achieve an erection or ejaculate , but it may affect his fertility .
The opposite of retrograde ejaculation , of course , is when semen shoots out faster than a round from an Uzi— something that can cause angst in men and stop a satisfying sex session in its tracks .
Premature ejaculation can be caused by a number of things , including medication , hormonal changes , high blood pressure , and stress . *
One of the other causes — an enlarged prostate .
Since the prostate generates 95 percent of the substance that comes out during ejaculation , it 's no wonder that it has a lot to say about what comes out and when .
Since an enlarged prostate gets more stimulation during sex , the friction can stimulate orgasm — leading a man to ejaculate whether he wants to or not .
* Premature ejaculation affects one - third of men .
Some treatment options include antidepressant medications ( SSRIs ) and behavioral techniques .
Some docs suggest the man masturbate an hour or two before sex to help delay ejaculation during sex .
Another technique is called the squeeze technique , in which the woman squeezes the penis at the point where the head meets the shaft for several seconds , right before a man feels like he 's going to ejaculate .
That should help delay orgasm ; wait 30 seconds , then continue .
YOU Tips !
Try Tantric .
When you hear the term tantric sex , you may assume that we 're talking about the ability to have a sexual interlude that lasts longer than a transcontinental flight .
But that 's not really the goal of tantric sex .
The goal stems from the desire and ability to have more of a physical and spiritual connection during sex .
Physically , for men , that means developing the ability to , as tantrics say , " retain the seed " — that is , having the ability to control ejaculation to allow sexual energy to flow .
But the essence of that practice — and of the tactics below — is really about mindfulness , or being deeply aware of yourself , your partner , your life , and what 's called the sacred life force .
These tips can help you maximize your sexual experience — and bring deeper emotional levels to your relationship .
Change your mind - set : Stop thinking that your sexual satisfaction is the responsibility of your partner .
We 're all responsible for our own experience .
Be open to discussions about sex with your partner , and be open in exploring your own body to help your partner help you .
Men , when you 're by yourself , you can practice increasing your sexual energy .
Bring yourself to two or three peaks at a time — ejaculating only after you 've come close to the edge a few times .
( Deep breathing can help you teeter on the edge without falling over . )
What you 're doing is priming your prostate gland like a pump to help improve sexual performance .
Challenge yourself .
You give yourself goals at work and in life , so why not create some for the bedroom ?
It can be anything — practicing Kegel exercises during the day or working to locate your G - spot if you have n't .
Be softer .
One of the main tenets here is to slow things down .
Do n't be in such a rush to get to bed or to finish up .
Carve out time to have a marathon lovemaking session in which the final goal is n't necessarily an orgasm but simply the journey itself .
Play to Your Partner 's Strengths
We all know the whole Mars and Venus debate .
Men are different sexual creatures than women .
Men respond to new visual cues ; women respond to friendly emotional ones .
Go a little deeper , and you understand that it 's more that men respond to fear and excitement , and women respond to intimacy .
Instead of agreeing to disagree , couples should capitalize on their differences to help make their partners more comfortable in bed .
So what does that mean ?
A man should make it a habit to look into his partner 's eyes during sex :
That eye lock is a way to increase intimacy ( and oxytocin ) .
And a woman should acknowledge that her partner 's arousal may be based more on urgency , meaning that it 's not so bad to have the lights on during sex , crave a quickie , or meet up for a lunch hour that involves absolutely no lunch at all .
Go Crazy
There 's a reason why bungee jumping , river rafting , and sneaking into the supply closet can make the perfect first date .
Doing novel things with another person stimulates dopamine — the feel - good chemical that 's elevated when you 're in love .
Also , since men are aroused by fear and anxiety and heart rates are elevated during both attraction and danger , it increases the likelihood that a man will find his partner more attractive during a daredevil date .
The dopamine is actually firing high when you first get together but not necessarily on the 80th date , so it 's even better to make special new adventures or variations more common the longer you 're together .
Novel choices are especially great for couples whose libido has diminished or whose sex life has gone stale .
Mix it Up
Guys , listen up .
While men have orgasms in 95 percent of sexual encounters , some reports have women having orgasms in 69 percent of encounters .
*
Interestingly , the more varied the sexual activity , the more likely a woman is to have an orgasm .
* We could n't have made up a better number for this statistic if we tried , eh ?
Of course , getting these numbers is hard to do , and some reports have much lower numbers .
That means mixing it up among manual , oral , and genital stimulation .
Oral sex , by the way , increases a woman 's chance of having an orgasm .
Open the Fridge
While you 're probably thinking that we 're going to tell you to get some chocolate sauce and whipped cream , the truth is that food plays a vital role in our sexual desire — some because of the smell , some because of the shape , and some because they alter your body chemistry to make you a more desirable mate .
Our choices :
Take advantage of pheromones : Capitalize on those scents by exposing yourself to them : Research shows that the scents of lemons , doughnuts , and licorice increase penile blood flow ( necessary for men to achieve an erection ) .
Do n't eat the doughnuts ( that slows blood flow dilation down ) ; just smell .
For women , it 's licorice and cucumbers .
Why ?
For women , the phallic shape subconsciously plays a large part in that .
Another good one to smell for its pheromone effect : baby powder .
It makes the female partner think of the evolutionary goal of sex , at least subconsciously .
Strengthen the sperm :
If your goal is to consummate your attraction with reproduction , then you should also supplement yourself with zinc , selenium , folic acid , and vitamins C and E , which have been shown to increase sperm count .
But most important is DHA - omega - 3 fats — the active ingredient in fish oil that can be obtained in even more purified form from the algae they eat .
Go back to that sauce : Chocolate has long been considered a love drug , because some of the ingredients * have a feel - good effect .
One study also shows that caffeine may have a positive effect on female libido .
Get Your Drive Back
If you feel as if you 've lost some of your sex drive , try these tactics for restoring some of your long - lost libido :
Check out our battery of tests from chapter 6 .
A change in hormones or energy levels could be a primary driver .
Ask yourself what happened in your relationship when you noticed your sex drive changing .
If you can ID the out - of - bed problem , it can help lead to an in - bed solution .
If you 're suffering from some kind of vaginal pain ( see chapter 7 ) , some strengthening exercises ( called Kegels ) may help , depending on the issue .
Experiment with more oral sex , fantasies , or watching each other in videos or in real life .
Change things up to charge things up .
Phenylethylamine , tryptophan , and anandamide .
Get comfortable with yourself .
You can try to reboot your system by experimenting with your body and finding what brings you joy ( for instance , many women like the shaft of their clitorises stimulated , rather than the tip , so you need to be able to communicate that to your partner ) .
Get comfortable with the fact that a mirror , sex toys , and locked doors can be a healthy part of a solo experience that can energize your sex life with your partner .
Check Your Waist
Fat does n't just make it hard for you to see your organs .
It also makes it hard for them to function , which is why increasing waist size means decreasing libido .
One of the reasons why men lose libido : omental fat ( fat around the belly ) .
That omental fat converts testosterone to estrogen and thus diminishes sex drive .
So if you 're experiencing a loss of sex drive , a doc may first check the size of your testes ( they should be roughly a ratio of 11/ 2 inches height to 1 inch width , or three finger widths by two finger widths ) .
If they 're normal size , it could mean that omental fat is causing the testosterone drop .
While you 're losing the belly fat , a medication called clomiphene , which blocks the conversion from testosterone to estrogen , may help .
If you want to keep your libido ( or get it back ) , get your waist size to less than half your height .
Go All Lombardi on Him
When it comes to sex , some women are as silent as a 1920s movie .
They fear that they can't tell their men what they want in bed — maybe because they 're shy , maybe because they 're embarrassed , or maybe because their partner 's ego is as delicate as a silk blouse .
But the best thing you can do with your mouth to improve your sex life has nothing to do with the X - rated thoughts crossing your mind right about now ; it 's talking .
Women need to teach , coach , and encourage their men to give them what they want — and how they want it .
Believe us , it 's much more of an ego boost for men to know they 're pleasing their women than not to know something was wrong in the first place .
Keep It Pumping
Good sex is n't just about blindfolds and finger paints .
It 's really about good blood flow .
That ensures you 're getting the right nutrients to your brain , as well as the right stimuli to your sex organs .
So improving your sex life means avoiding the things that decrease blood flow ( nicotine , drugs , saturated fat , trans fats , sugar , syrups , diabetes , high BP ) and embracing the things that increase blood flow ( exercise , avocados , fruits , vegetables , 100 percent whole grains , ginseng , ginkgo biloba , l- arginine , lemon , citriulline ) .
There are not too many big eats in Denver but this is one : 7 pound breakfast burrito at Jack - n - Grill .
Yesterday - with T - Bonz , the scale , and the camera - I went to check it out .
Females who finish it get free food at Jack - n - Grill for life .
Males get TWO things : JACK and SQUAT .
Before going inside , me : We ordered .
T , a combo plate .
Me , the grande :
The burrito is stuffed with potatoes , eggs , onions , and ham bits .
Lots of cheese on top .
Smothered in green chile or red .
I got the pork green chile .
Here it is compared to a combination plate :
The dish it came in was maybe 18 " x 5 " and deep .
The two big tortillas did not go all around it but they sort of hooded the sides and top .
The burrito was steaming hot for about the first twenty minutes or so .
For the first half of it or so it was very delicious .
The pork green chile is very very good .
Trade out bacon for the ham and this thing would kick ass .
I kept eating .
And eating .. And eating ... I think this was the point : Waving the white flag :
What was left : I separated it into a pound on the left and a pound on the right .
Maybe - MAYBE - I could have stuffed one side in me , but not both sides .
When I weighed in after , as expected up 5 : The stomach bulge is usually a bit lower .
It was riding high then : Next time : 1 . Get bacon .
2 . No Coke .
3 . Do not eat breakfast first .

Internet service providers and wireless carriers should be forced to pay fees to support Canadian artists just like traditional broadcasters , since they make money off internet radio , Canada 's broadcast regulator has been told .
" They are benefiting from the privilege of being able to broadcast to Canadians , but unlike traditional broadcasters , they currently have no obligations commensurate to that benefit , " Sherry Kerr , vice - president and general counsel for the satellite radio company Sirius Canada Inc.
Friday told a hearing in Gatineau , Que .
The hearing is one of a series being held by the Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission to determine whether broadcasting over the internet should be subject to federal regulations .
Kerr argued that internet radio is a direct competitor and a serious threat to satellite radio , especially now that it is becoming increasingly available on portable wireless devices and even some devices that can be built into the dashboard of a car .
" This view is supported by an increasing number of articles in the press opining that internet radio is a category killer and the category that it would kill would be ours , " she said .
That would be bad for Canadian artists , as satellite radio broadcasters are required by the CRTC to offer significant support for Canadian artists by ensuring a certain percentage of their content is Canadian — specifically supporting emerging artists and contributing money to a fund to support Canadian artists .
Other broadcasters have similar obligations , which also indirectly force them to exclude certain non-Canadian content , Kerr said .
At the same time , wireless and ISPs now have revenues in the billions per year , some of that driven by audio broadcasting , and some are increasingly behaving like broadcasters .
For example , Kerr said , Bell Mobility provides a service that gives customers access to 60 internet radio stations for $ 8 a month .
Geoblocking suggested as solution
Kerr said one way to level the playing field would be requiring ISPs to geoblock — make unavailable to Canadians — audio content that does n't comply with Canadian content requirements .
That move would thrill satellite radio companies , Kerr added .
" We would actually throw a party for you .
Nothing else would level the playing field for us from a regulatory perspective , " she said .
" However , we recognize that this approach flies in face of the principles of openness and freedom of choice that governs the internet . "
She suggested that an alternative would be to require wireless carriers and ISPs to pay a levy proportional to their revenues related to broadcasting .
That would n't completely level the playing field , as broadcasters are still bound by Canadian content rules that internet radio is not , Kerr said .
Because of that , she said , new media should pay a higher levy while the levy should be lowered for her own company .
She acknowledged that some people would be opposed to the new fee and consider it a tax that could boost internet fees for wireless and broadband internet customers , and discourage them from buying those services .
However , she said , given that people are willing to pay much higher fees for faster internet and the fact that it is becoming a necessity , it 's unlikely the levy would cost the companies customers .
" Customers are highly unlikely to cancel their service because they 're paying an extra dollar a month , " she said .
Published in : Google
Google is normally quite secretive about their search infrastructure but , in a break from tradition , they have revealed that a single search query on Google can consume the processing power of 1000 machines .
Google Fellow Jeff Dean , in a keynote talk at WSDM 2009 , shared some numbers about Google ’s impressive growth run from 1999 to 2009 .
According to Dean , while both search queries and processing power have gone up by a factor of 1000 , latency has gone down from around 1000ms to 200 ms .
Crawler updates now take minutes compared to months in 1999 .
Another significant change was the switch to holding the complete search index in memory , resulting in the use of 1000 machines to handle a single query compared to just 12 previously .
This revelation may be a bit embarrassing for Google , which has defended its ecological record in the past , claiming that a single Google query takes just 0.0003KWh of energy and that the Google datacenters are “ the world ’s most efficient . ”

Add Thomas Friedman to Tyler , myself , Lee Ohanian and others suggesting immigration as a way to alleviate the recession :
Leave it to a brainy Indian to come up with the cheapest and surest way to stimulate our economy : immigration .
“ All you need to do is grant visas to two million Indians , Chinese and
Koreans , ” said Shekhar Gupta , editor of The Indian Express newspaper .
“ We will buy up all the subprime homes .
We will work 18 hours a day to
pay for them .
We will immediately improve your savings rate – no Indian
bank today has more than 2 percent nonperforming loans because not
paying your mortgage is considered shameful here .
And we will start new
companies to create our own jobs and jobs for more Americans . ”
Note that the multiplier on the “ buy a house , get a visa ” strategy would be much larger than any possible domestic multiplier since the money would come from outside the economy ( and efficiency would improve as well . )
I think there would be considerable support among economists that immigration ( buy a house , get a visa ) , a payroll tax cut and maintaining state and local funding would be reasonably good policies in this recession ( albeit not necessarily sufficient ) yet these policies seem to be the ones that the political system rejects out of hand .

Now , I can understand rejecting these policies as compared to doing nothing , ala a precautionary principle , but why these policies are rejected compared to taking a trillion dollar gamble is puzzling even to someone like myself schooled in public choice .
“ It is the very error of the moon .
She comes more near the earth
than she was wont .
And makes
men mad . ”
— William Shakespeare , Othello
ACROSS THE CENTURIES , many a person has uttered the phrase “ There must be a full moon out there ” in an attempt to explain weird happenings at night .
Indeed , the Roman goddess of the moon bore a name that remains familiar to us today : Luna , prefix of the word “ lunatic . ”
Greek philosopher Aristotle and Roman historian Pliny the Elder suggested that the brain was the “ moistest ” organ in the body and thereby most susceptible to the pernicious influences of the moon , which triggers the tides .
Belief in the “ lunar lunacy effect , ” or “ Transylvania effect , ” as it is sometimes called , persisted in Europe through the Middle Ages , when humans were widely reputed to transmogrify into werewolves or vampires during a full moon .
Even today many people think the mystical powers of the full moon induce erratic behaviors , psychiatric hospital admissions , suicides , homicides , emergency room calls , traffic accidents , fights at professional hockey games , dog bites and all manner of strange events .
One survey revealed that 45 percent of college students believe moonstruck humans are prone to unusual behaviors , and other surveys suggest that mental health professionals may be still more likely than laypeople to hold this conviction .
In 2007 several police departments in the U.K. even added officers on full - moon nights in an effort to cope with presumed higher crime rates .
Water at Work ?
Following Aristotle and Pliny the Elder , some contemporary authors , such as Miami psychiatrist Arnold Lieber , have conjectured that the full moon ’s supposed effects on behavior arise from its influence on water .
The human body , after all , is about 80 percent water , so perhaps the moon works its mischievous magic by somehow disrupting the alignment of water molecules in the nervous system .
But there are at least three reasons why this explanation does n’t “ hold water , ” pardon the pun .
First , the gravitational effects of the moon are far too minuscule to generate any meaningful effects on brain activity , let alone behavior .
As the late astronomer George Abell of the University of California , Los Angeles , noted , a mosquito sitting on our arm exerts a more powerful gravitational pull on us than the moon does .
Yet to the best of our knowledge , there have been no reports of a “ mosquito lunacy effect . ”
Second , the moon ’s gravitational force affects only open bodies of water , such as oceans and lakes , but not contained sources of water , such as the human brain .
Third , the gravitational effect of the moon is just as potent during new moons — when the moon is invisible to us — as it is during full moons .
There is a more serious problem for fervent believers in the lunar lunacy effect : no evidence that it exists .
Florida International University psychologist James Rotton , Colorado State University astronomer Roger Culver and University of Saskatchewan psychologist Ivan W. Kelly have searched far and wide for any consistent behavioral effects of the full moon .
In all cases , they have come up empty - handed .
By combining the results of multiple studies and treating them as though they were one huge study — a statistical procedure called meta - analysis — they have found that full moons are entirely unrelated to a host of events , including crimes , suicides , psychiatric problems and crisis center calls .
In their 1985 review of 37 studies entitled “ Much Ado about the Full Moon , ” which appeared in one of psychology ’s premier journals , Psychological Bulletin , Rotton and Kelly humorously bid adieu to the full - moon effect and concluded that further research on it was unnecessary .
Persistent critics have disagreed with this conclusion , pointing to a few positive findings that emerge in scattered studies .
Still , even the handful of research claims that seem to support full - moon effects have collapsed on closer investigation .
In one study published in 1982 an author team reported that traffic accidents were more frequent on full - moon nights than on other nights .
Yet a fatal flaw marred these findings : in the period under consideration , full moons were more common on weekends , when more people drive .
When the authors reanalyzed their data to eliminate this confounding factor , the lunar effect vanished .
Where Belief Begins
So if the lunar lunacy effect is merely an astronomical and psychological urban legend , why is it so widespread ?
There are several probable reasons .
Media coverage almost surely plays a role .
Scores of Hollywood horror flicks portray full - moon nights as peak times of spooky occurrences such as stabbings , shootings and psychotic behaviors .
Perhaps more important , research demonstrates that many people fall prey to a phenomenon that University of Wisconsin–Madison psychologists Loren and Jean Chapman termed “ illusory correlation ” — the perception of an association that does not in fact exist .
For example , many people who have joint pain insist that their pain increases during rainy weather , although research disconfirms this assertion .
Much like the watery mirages we observe on freeways during hot summer days , illusory correlations can fool us into perceiving phenomena in their absence .
Illusory correlations result in part from our mind ’s propensity to attend to — and recall — most events better than nonevents .
When there is a full moon and something decidedly odd happens , we usually notice it , tell others about it and remember it .
We do so because such co-occurrences fit with our preconceptions .
Indeed , one study showed that psychiatric nurses who believed in the lunar effect wrote more notes about patients ’ peculiar behavior than did nurses who did not believe in this effect .
In contrast , when there is a full moon and nothing odd happens , this nonevent quickly fades from our memory .
As a result of our selective recall , we erroneously perceive an association between full moons and myriad bizarre events .
Still , the illusory correlation explanation , though probably a crucial piece of the puzzle , does not account for how the full - moon notion got started .
One intriguing idea for its origins comes to us courtesy of psychiatrist Charles L. Raison , now at Emory University , and several of his colleagues .
According to Raison , the lunar lunacy effect may possess a small kernel of truth in that it may once have been genuine .
Raison conjectures that before the advent of outdoor lighting in modern times , the bright light of the full moon deprived people who were living outside — including many who had severe mental disorders — of sleep .
Because sleep deprivation often triggers erratic behavior in people with certain psychological conditions , such as bipolar disorder ( formerly called manic depression ) , the full moon may have been linked to a heightened rate of bizarre behaviors in long - bygone eras .
So the lunar lunacy effect is , in Raison and his colleagues ’ terms , a “ cultural fossil . ”
We may never know whether this ingenious explanation is correct .
But in today ’s world at least , the lunar lunacy effect appears to be no better supported than is the idea that the moon is made of green cheese .
In 2017 , it ’s going to be important for any law firm to have a strong internet presence .
More and more people are searching for representation online , and any firm that does not spend time and resources on its online presence will regret it .
Attorney marketing is no longer what it once was : a question of buying the biggest ad in the yellow pages , putting up some billboards around town , and relying on past clients to generate word of mount business .
Practices are living and dying by their digital marketing
以前、とあるシステムのソースコードを読む機会があったのだけどあまりにひどかった。あのひどいコードでまあまあまともに動いているというのが逆に信じられない。今日昼ご飯を食べながら少し話していたのだけど意外と知られていないようなので、話せる範囲でいかにひどいのか説明してみようと思う。
まず、ソースコードが大雑把に見積もって3750万行あるのだけど、その中でまともに機能しているコードは3%しかない。10分の1程度のソースコードで同程度の機能を実現しているシステムもあるのでほんとあのシステムのコードはゴミだと言っても過言じゃない(*1 )
プログラマとしてはなんでそのプロジェクトはそんな状態になってしまったのか気になるところだけども、まあ多くのプロジェクト同様、真相を知る人は誰もいない。でもまあ、実際に機能しているコードのコピーみたいなものがあちこちに散らばっていることからしてコピー＆ペーストが盛んに行われていたのは間違いないと思う。それもゴミコードの40%くらいは「コピペして書き換えて新しい機能を実装」ですらない。とりあえずコピペだけして放置。全く役に立っていない。(*2 )
Pythonのコードで説明すると
def func_a (... ) :
という関数があるところにコピペが行われて
def func_a (... ) : def func_b (... ) :
こんな状態になっていたりする。func_aとか例えていえばファイルを開いたけど読まないとか、SQLクエリを作ったけど発行しないとか、そういう役に立たないコードになっている。func_bの後半にくっついているAのコードに関してはBのコードの最後でreturnしているのでそもそも呼ばれすらしなかったりする。Pythonで書かれているわけじゃないんだけどこういうレベルのクオリティって話。まともに動いているのが信じられないよね。
なんでこれで機能停止せずに動き続けているかっていうと、まあ設計者が神がかっていたというかいかれてたというかフレームワークが「モジュール内の特定の条件を満たす関数を全部呼ぶ」という設計になっていて、壊れたAのコピーがあったとしても壊れていないAのコピーが1個でも残っていれば機能が失われないからなんだ。まあ100%安心ってことはないんだけどさ。で、そういう設計なので壊れて条件を満たさなくなった関数がゴロゴロしていても平気。ウェブアプリで言えば「/add_itemにアクセスするとアイテムの追加画面が出るんだけど、実は/append_itemにアクセスすると古い今では機能しない追加画面が出る」とかいう状況。
そうそう、ソースコードのバージョン管理もひどいんだ。っていうかバージョン管理してない。リポジトリがない。コードをいじりたかったらまず適当な人にコードをコピーしてもらう。で、いじる。いじって壊れて動かなくなっちゃったらデバッグできる人がいないから丸ごと削除して、また新しくコピーを貰う。そりゃー、重要なコードのコピーがあちこちにある方が壊れにくいから引き継がれやすいよね。なんか最近では「ソースコードはほぼ同じ内容のを2コピー持つ。引き継ぐときは二人の人から1個ずつもらうこと」なんて運用で致命的なバグを入れちゃう確率を下げているらしい。(*3 ) その貰った二つのコードセットをマージするところでまた適当にマージするもんだから同じものを2個入れてしまうとか逆になくしてしまうとかもよくやるらしい。ある機能に関してはもともと4タイプの入力フォーマットを受け付けていたのにいつの間にか2つに減ってしまって、仕方がないので1個コピーして3つ目を作っただの、ものによっては実は4つに戻ってるだのと…。(* 4 )
よくこれで動いていると思うよ。誰かリファクタリングしないのかなぁ。無理か。

I spoke with Steve Scott on WCBS 880 about the rough week ahead and the future of air travel .
Articles about my findings in Programming , CakePHP , PHP , C++ , cross platform programming , and just life in general .
I am a fan of file and folder comparison utility Beyond Compare from Scooter Software .
It is a very polished and powerful piece of software with a big following .
But I was intrigued by some of the unusual decisions they had taken : competing in a market with lots of free alternatives ; going 6 years between major upgrades ; re-writing from scratch ; releasing a Linux version ; and having an extremely generous trial policy .
How had they succeeded despite ignoring much of the conventional wisdom ?
Craig Peterson of Scooter Software kindly agreed to answer my questions .
Can you tell me a bit about your background before working on Beyond Compare .
I started at Scooter Software straight out of college .
I did a lot of programming for fun before then , but this was my first professional job and my first introduction to Delphi .
How long have you been working on Beyond Compare and what is your role ?
I ’m the lead developer and I started here in late 2000 , a few months before significant development on v2 started .
Most of my time is spent working on the directory comparison and the virtual filesystem layer ( ftp , zips , version control ) , but there are very few places in the program that I have n’t worked on .
My non-development tasks include managing the build process , interfacing with our component vendors , keeping track of any interns , and tech support , when there ’s difficult questions or when the dedicated staff do n’t have time .
How many other people work on Beyond Compare on the business side and on the development side ?
There ’s one other full - time developer , one part time developer , two in tech support , two in sales , and our president , who handles everything else .
There are lots of different file comparison tools .
How do you manage to run a successful business with so many competitors , many of them free ?
Competing with the free tools has n’t been as hard as I expected .
The big advantage we have here is that people are paying us for the software , so we have strong incentive to provide good tech support and to provide the features they want .
We work 8 hours a day on it , which gives us more time to develop new features than someone doing it as a hobby , and we can afford commercial libraries that someone providing a free utility can’t .
As for the commercial competitors , it ’s mostly a matter of providing something that they do n’t .
In our case BC ’s directory comparison is much more powerful than the alternatives , and we have viewers for other file types like images , binary files , and data files .
That allowed us to keep competing even when we were lagging in other areas .
What are the main methods you use to promote Beyond Compare ?
We rely almost entirely on word of mouth .
We ’ve had lots of customers tell us that they brought BC with them when they switched jobs and ended up getting their companies to spring for larger licenses .
We do spend some money on Google AdWords , and we hired a company to periodically submit our site to search engines and download sites , but we ’ve never run a print or banner ad .
scootersoftware.com has an enviable Google page rank of 6 and ranks second for “ file comparison software ” .
Have you spent a lot of effort on SEO ?
We had a company help with SEO for a lot of the 2.x lifetime , and they ’d suggest tweaks to improve things .
For v3 we took a different approach and redesigned the site to make it more accessible to potential customers .
I ’m sure some of those changes helped , since we ended up adding more descriptions and using more synonyms , but it was primarily a case of asking how we could make it easier to find the information someone would want and expanding on that .
We still have a fairly wordy page title though , and I think that ’s entirely for the search engines ’ benefit .
Are most of your customers programmers , or does the software appeal to a wider audience ?
I ’d say more than 50 % are programmers , but there ’s definitely a wider audience .
System administrators use it for migrating servers , web developers use it instead of a traditional FTP client , and non-techs use it for backups or synching their laptops and desktops .
How long do you allow people to use the trial version ?
The trial is for 30 days , but it only counts days you actually run it , so if you use it infrequently you could easily go six months or more before it times out .
I used Beyond Compare for ages before I bought a licence .
I would have bought it sooner if you had been less generous with the trial .
Why did you go for such a long trial period ?
That goes back to competing with all the other products out there .
If someone installs two programs to evaluate , and then does n’t have a chance to really try them out until a month later , the one that works is more likely to get the sale .
It also makes it more likely that potential customers will learn the application and start relying on it , so when it does come time to pay they ’re less likely to throw out that investment and switch to another tool .
I understand Beyond Compare v3 is a complete re-write .
Why did you feel a complete re-write was necessary ?
Was it a good business decision in hindsight ?
There were two reasons why we felt a re-write was justified : ( 1 ) we had a lot of features we wanted to implement that would n’t work in the current framework , and ( 2 ) we over - estimated the speed that we could re-write it .
In the text compare we wanted inline editing with dynamic re-comparisons and 3 - way merge , neither of which would have been easy to integrate into the v2 codebase .
The directory compare had similarly major changes , though a lot of that is internal and in preparation for other features , so it is n’t as visible .
There was also all the work we did to get a Linux release out .
It was n’t a complete re-write though .
Anything that did n’t need significant changes , like our reporting engine , was brought over mostly as is .
I think it was a good business decision in that it allowed us to rethink and rework a lot of things without the old baggage , but it was bad in that it significantly limited what we could release in the meantime .
We ended up going 6 years between major versions and even though we were always busy adding new features , we could n’t release them until we got back to feature parity with v2 .
Beyond Compare is written is Delphi .
What would you say are the advantages and disadvantages of Delphi compared to other development ‘ stacks ’ ?
I think Delphi is still the best tool for developing a native Windows application quickly .
It ’s very easy to mock up interfaces and then fill them in with code .
The resulting exes do n’t have any external dependencies , which makes redistributing them easy .
The VCL ( UI framework ) ships with source code , and that has permeated the community , so the vast majority of third - party components also include source .
On the flip side , it still ca n’t produce 64 - bit executables and is n’t cross platform .
It does n’t have a garbage collector or as large of a class library as Java or C# .
The community is n’t as large either , so there ’s usually only a couple of choices when you ’re looking for specific components , and if that vendor stops developing it , there are n’t as many people to pick up the slack .
If you had to do it all again , starting now , would you still choose Delphi ?
Probably , but I would seriously consider C# or Qt .
In our case we have a lot of experience with Delphi and we know the libraries , so starting from scratch in another language would be a significant barrier .
Beyond Compare has a very slick user interface .
Did you do any usability testing ?
Not as such .
Our primary usability improvements come from using our own product .
We use BC every day , for every comparison we do , so anything that sticks out tends to get squashed quickly .
We also get alpha / beta versions into customers ’ hands as soon as possible , and keep iterating until they ’re happy .
V2 and v3 both had private beta tests that lasted over a year and a half , and some of the features changed dramatically in response to that feedback .
Beyond Compare has a nice integration with Windows Explorer .
Was that difficult to do ?
Were you able to do it in Delphi ?
The first version of it was submitted by a user , so it was n’t difficult at all .
It has taken a lot of refinement to get perfect though , and we were changing it all the way through to the final 3.0 release .
It is written in Delphi , though I did rewrite it in C++ in order to get a 64 - bit version working .
FreePascal has since started producing 64 - bit binaries , so we ’re back to the single Delphi version again .
You have Windows and Linux versions .
What did you use to write the Linux version ?
We ’re using a heavily customized version of Borland ’s now - dead Kylix product , which was Delphi for Linux .
It does allow us to compile both versions from the same source code , but it ’s showing its age and I would n’t recommend it to anyone else .
Our driving goal is to have the best Windows version we can , which means sticking with Delphi and using what ’s available to produce the Linux version .
If OS X and Linux support outweighed that we would use a cross- platform option like Qt or Java , but we believe the Windows version would suffer in that case .
Do you sell many licences for Linux ?
We sell enough to fund its development , so it ’s a successful product .
It does introduce new challenges though , both in development and tech support , so if we were a smaller developer it probably would n’t be worth the overhead .
Do you think there will there ever be a web version of Beyond Compare ?
I can see it as a possibility , and it would be interesting to explore , but it ’s not something we ’re looking into right now .
I think it would have a different audience than the current product , and would probably never be as powerful as what we can do locally .
How did you choose the price ?
Our $ 30 standard edition is about the same price as our commercial competitors , and seems to be the standard shareware utility price .
The pro edition was priced based on our competitors , what our customers were telling us they ’d pay , and what we felt the downward pressure of the freeware / opensource alternatives introduced .
We keep the price low in order to make our profits on larger quantities sold , instead of a larger margin per-unit .
We have increased our multi-user pricing considerably over the years though ; the discounts were very steep in v1 and v2 , and the feedback we got was that it was just too cheap for what it provided .
I see some translator credits on the website .
Is v3 available in languages other than English ?
Not officially , but we have just released beta versions of a couple of languages .
The current credits are for the v2 translators , who are generally the same people working on v3 translations .
How important are resellers to your sales ?
We get a lot of sales through resellers , but it ’s generally from people who would buy it either way .
Foreign resellers are a help to the customers though , because they allow them to order in their own language using the local currency .
Does Scooter Software have any other products besides Beyond Compare ?
No , BC keeps us plenty busy .
Thank you Craig .
You can download a free trial of Beyond Compare from the Scooter Software website .
I have no affiliation with Scooter Software beyond being a paying customer .

British oil firms are facing a legal battle over exploitation of the huge Canadian tar sand fields with indigenous people who claim the industry is ruining their traditional lands .
The Co-operative Bank will announce today that it is to fund a legal challenge by the Beaver Lake Cree Nation , which claims the boom in tar sands extraction is destroying their hunting and fishing lands .
The court challenge calls for an injunction to stop more than 16,000 permits issued by the Alberta state government and , if successful , could dramatically reduce or even stop what has been described as a modern day " gold rush " for the oil , spurred by the expectation of high long - term oil prices .
Last year the International Energy Agency estimated that the amount of oil in tar sands and other " unconventional " sources , especially in Canada and Venezuela , was 1 - 2tn barrels , only slightly less than the remaining conventional oil sources .
Companies involved include Shell , BP , ConocoPhillips and Total .
Visiting London this week to highlight the case , the Beaver Lake Chief Al Lameman said they had taken action after evidence began to emerge that caribou , elk , moose , deer and other animals were disappearing and infected with diseases , fish stocks were damaged by pollution in the water , and plants used for traditional medicine were under threat .
A study funded by the US - based Natural Resources Defense Council estimated more than 160 m migratory birds could die early over the next 30 - 50 years because of disturbance of migratory grounds and pollution .
There have also been claims of an increase in human health problems .
" The impacts are very , very devastating sometimes , " he said .
" We refer to the earth as our mother , the mother of all things . "
The census records 922 Beaver Lake Cree people , of which about half live on the reserve .
Most of them regularly hunt , fish for winter food supplies and gather medicinal plants , said Jack Woodward , theindigenous peoples ' rights lawyer who is handling the case .
" People tend to think first nation [ indigenous peoples ] culture is dying off and gone , and it's not , " he added .
The case rests on a treaty signed in 1876 under which the Beaver Lake Cree gave up their ownership of huge areas of land , in return for a guarantee that " as long as the sun shines , the rivers flow and the grass grows , we can continue our traditional way of life " , including " traditional rights to hunt , fish , trap and gather for food and support " .
However another clause in the treaty excluded land that may " be required or taken up for settlement , mining , lumbering or other purposes . "
In 2007 , Woodward helped win a landmark ruling in the British Columbia Supreme Court that the provincial government had overstepped its authority in granting land - use rights to companies without the approval of the local Tsilhqot 'in first nation .
He said the precedent should help the case against Alberta , which was originally lodged in May 2008 .
A spokesman for the Alberta state government said : " The province has not yet filed a statement of defence , although the intent is to rigorously defend ... this lawsuit . "
He noted the economic benefits of tar sand exploitation , saying that between 2000 - 2008 an estimated CAN $ 87bn ( $ 67.5 bn ) was invested in oil sands projects in Alberta , that and every dollar invested in the oil sands creates about $ 6 worth of economic activity in Alberta and another $ 3 elsewhere .
The Co-operative Bank has offered the Beaver Lake Cree nation £ 50,000 initially and more funding if necessary in future .
Paul Monaghan , head of social goals and sustainability for Co-operative Financial Services , said the company wanted to help fight the legal battle and publicise the problem internationally .
If the Beaver Lake case is successful , other indigenous groups could also mount legal challenges and oil companies could be hit with potentially " massive investment damages " , said Monaghan .
" In addition to the ecological devastation , the extraction and production of these fuels emits between three and eight times more carbon dioxide than conventional oils , " he added .
" If unchallenged , this trend risks making attempts to avoid dangerous levels of climate change almost impossible . "
In the Beaver Lake area , future extraction might not stop altogether , but would be much more tightly controlled " to the point it is not a danger any more " , said Lameman .
" What we want is control over what 's happening on it . "

DETROIT —
In recent years , despite many challenges to his leadership of General Motors , Rick Wagoner had managed to keep a firm grip on his job , like hands wrapped tight around a steering wheel .
During his tenure as chief executive , beginning in 2000 , the company ’s stock has fallen from $ 70 a share to less than $ 4 now , and its market share has fallen roughly 10 percentage points .
There have been many challenges to his authority , most notably from the investor Kirk Kerkorian in 2006 and from angry members of Congress during hearings last fall .
Throughout the attacks , he had managed to retain the unwavering support of his board .
For a time , it seemed he might become the rare chief executive who gets another chance , this time to try to fix many of the problems that occurred on his watch .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Global warming concerns took center stage Monday as two organizations held rallies to draw attention to an issue that President Barack Obama has promised to place near the top of his agenda .
Demonstrators stand outside the Capitol Power Plant in Washington on Monday to protest the plant 's use of coal .
A group of young protesters gathered in front of the Capitol to rally on behalf of legislation to reduce carbon emissions , decrease dependence on coal and oil , and speed a national drive toward " clean " energy .
Later Monday , hundreds of representatives of a coalition of environmental , public health , social justice and other advocacy organizations marched around Capitol Hill and encircled a Washington coal - fired power plant to highlight the issue of climate change .
The group , protesting the Capitol Power Plant 's use of coal , stood in front of the plant 's gated entrances .
The plant powers the heating and cooling systems in the Capitol , as well as roughly a dozen other federal office buildings on Capitol Hill .
" The Capitol Power Plant , sitting just blocks from Capitol Hill , symbolizes the stranglehold coal has over our government and future , " the group said on its Web site .
" It 's not the largest or the dirtiest power plant in the country , but as the plant that is actually run by and for Congress it serves as an incredibly iconic symbol of what is wrong with our country 's energy and climate policy . "
No arrests were made as a result of the protest , which " did n't affect the operations of the power plant , " Capitol police Sgt. Kimberly Schneider said .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid released a letter Thursday calling for the plant to convert to 100 percent natural gas by the end of 2009 .
" Taking this major step toward cleaning up the Capitol Power Plant 's emissions would be an important demonstration of Congress ' willingness to deal with the enormous challenges of global warming , energy independence and our inefficient use of finite fossil fuels , " they wrote .
Several members of Congress and environmental leaders addressed the earlier rally , which was held at the conclusion to Power Shift ' 09 , a four - day environmental summit organized by the Energy Action Coalition .
The coalition describes itself as an umbrella organization of 700 groups fighting for " clean energy solutions and the creation of a new green economy . "
It 's time to " turn up the political heat in Washington so we can turn down the heat on Mother Earth , " Rep. Chris Van Hollen , D - Maryland , told the crowd .
" The science tells us that the time for talking about this problem is over .
The time for action is now . "
The concept of " clean coal " is a " dirty lie , " added environmental activist Robert F. Kennedy .
" The most important thing you can do is not to change your light bulb but to change [ members of Congress who have been ] corrupted by ... dirty , filthy industry . "
America needs to be freed from the " carbon cronies , " who are part of the " biggest threat to civilization , " Kennedy said .

The sentencing of a widow to 40 lashes for mingling with two young men has sparked new criticism of Saudi Arabia .
Khamisa Sawadi , who is Syrian but was married to a Saudi , was convicted and sentenced last week for meeting with men who were not her immediate relatives .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The two men , including one who was Mrs Sawadi 's late husband 's nephew , were reportedly bringing her bread .
They were also found guilty and sentenced to prison terms and lashes .
The woman 's lawyer , Abdel Rahman al - Lahem , said today that he plans to appeal against the verdict , which also demands that Mrs Sawadi be deported after serving her prison term .
Saudi Arabia 's strict interpretation of Islam prohibits men and women who are not immediate relatives from mingling and women from driving .
The playing of music , dancing and many movies also are a concern for hard - liners who believe they violate religious and moral values .
A special police unit called the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice enforces these laws , patrolling public places to make sure women are covered and not wearing make - up , sexes do not mix , shops close five times a day for Muslim prayers and men go to the mosque to worship .
But criticism of the religious police and judiciary has been growing in Saudi , where many say they exploit their broad mandate to interfere in people 's lives .
Last month , the Saudi king dismissed the chief of the religious police and a cleric who condoned killing of TV network owners who broadcast " immoral content " - part of a shake - up signalling an effort to weaken the kingdom's hard - line Sunni Muslim establishment .

In Mrs Sawadi 's case , she met the two 24 - year - old men last April after she asked them to bring her five loaves of bread .
The men - the nephew , Fahd al - Anzi , and his friend and business partner Hadiyan bin Zein - went to Mrs Sawadi 's home in the city of al - Chamil , north of the Saudi capital Riyadh .
After delivering the bread , the two men were arrested by one of the religious police .
The court said it based its 3 March ruling on " citizen information " and testimony from Mr al - Anzi 's father , who accused Mrs Sawadi of corruption .
The court verdict read : " Because she said she does n't have a husband and because she is not a Saudi , conviction of the defendants of illegal mingling has been confirmed . "
Mrs Sawadi told the court that she considered Mr al - Anzi to be her son , because she breast - fed him when he was a baby , but the court denied her claim , saying she did not provide evidence .
In Islamic tradition , breast - feeding establishes a degree of maternal relation , even if a woman nurses a child who is not biologically hers .
Mrs Sawadi commonly asked her neighbours for help after her husband died .
Some commentators have spoken out over the case , accusing the religious police of going too far .

LIFE Magazine , Spring 2009
There is a priceless exchange in the 20th episode of “ The Sopranos ” — the soap - opera about a New Jersey mobster whose stressful career brings him to the couch of a psychotherapist , Jennifer Melfi .
Tony Soprano is annoyed with his teenage son , who has been moaning about the ultimate absurdity of life :
Melfii : Sounds to me like Anthony junior may have stumbled onto existentialism .
Tony : Fuckin ’ internet !
Melfi :
No , no , no .
It ’s a European philosophy .
Quite so ; one cannot blame the internet for everything .
Existentialism has roots in the 19th - century thought of Kierkegaard and Nietzsche , but it is most famously linked with restless French students in the 1960s and the writings of Jean - Paul Sartre and Albert Camus .
Sure enough , Anthony junior has been assigned Camus ’s novel “ L’Etranger ” in class .
It also does n’t help his precarious state of mind when his grandmother bitterly tells him “ in the end , you die in your own arms …
It ’s all a big Nothing . ”
Well , plus ça change .
It is not only on television that nihilist strains of existentialism continue to tempt young minds , and no doubt the minds of some grandmothers .
Last autumn I taught a seminar about ideas of nothingness at the New School , a university in New York .
Most of the students were already keen on Sartre and Camus , and among the many facets of nothingness that we looked at in science , literature , art and philosophy , it was death and the pointlessness of life that most gripped them .
They showed a polite interest in the role of vacuum in 17th - century physics and in the development of the concept of zero .
But existentialist angst was the real draw .
Existentialism may have flourished in the 1960s , but its themes are the oldest in the world — indeed , one puzzle about existentialism is why it took so long to come into existence .
The eponymous hero of the Mesopotamian “ Epic of Gilgamesh ” , which was written in the second millennium BC , is plunged into gloomy thoughts of his own mortality after his beloved friend Enkidu expires .
Gilgamesh belatedly realises that he , too , must die , and this fact makes all of life seem empty to him :
The river rises , flows over its banks
and carries us all away , like mayflies
floating downstream : they stare at the sun ,
then all at once there is nothing .
Emptiness , void , the abyss : synonyms for nothingness provide the most popular metaphorical images for death .
Winston Churchill liked to refer to it as “ black velvet ” .
And just as morbid fears make people think of nothingness , the reverse is also true .
In the 17th century , contemplating the empty vastness of the heavens , Pascal recorded in his “ Pensées ” that “ the eternal silence of these infinite spaces fills me with dread . ”
It is also terrifying , he wrote , to consider the “ new abyss ” freshly revealed in the minutest parts of nature .
Pascal , it seems , found nothingness everywhere , though he noted that on the whole man is , perhaps fortunately , “ incapable of seeing the nothingness from which he emerges . ”
How anything can emerge from nothingness is a question which the ancient Greeks answered by saying that it can’t .
There must , they reasoned , have always been something .
But that seems to raise a further question , which was given its most concise formulation by Leibniz at the end of the 17th century : why is there something rather than nothing ?
Another German philosopher , Martin Heidegger , who died in 1976 , argued that this puzzle was the most important question of all , though he never quite got round to answering it .
Heidegger was infamous for his bizarre neologisms and contorted language , which were especially evident when he wrestled with nothingness .
He even invented a verb to describe what nothingness does : in the English translation , it “ noths ” .
Well , maybe it doth , but this does not get us very far .
One might think that science will eventually be able to explain the matter ; certainly many cosmologists have said so .
But there is an eternal snag , because any answer to the question of why there is something rather than nothing will end up chasing its own tail .
Any law of nature or mathematics , any purported set of physical conditions , indeed any fact at all counts as “ something ” , and is thus itself part of what is supposed to be explained .
Every explanation must start somewhere .
But there is not , and never could be , anywhere left for this one to start .
Faced with the apparent impossibility of making much headway with nothingness , poets have resorted to cracking jokes about it , many of which are abominable puns .
Most of these revolve around the double meaning exemplified in the title of a memoir on death by the novelist Julian Barnes , published last year : “ Nothing to be Frightened of ” .
His readers may find some comfort in the fact that , however broodingly terrified they are by their own mortality , Barnes has an even worse case of the disease .
Shakespeare , too , made much merry play with the word “ nothing ” , and not only in “ Much Ado ” .
Whether or not something may come of nothing is a recurring theme in “ King Lear ” , and there is a particularly convoluted verbal joust between Hamlet and Ophelia — some of which escapes contemporary readers unaware that in Elizabethan slang “ nothing ” can mean “ vagina ” .
One verbally agile philosopher remarked in an encyclopedia entry that it is perhaps not Nothing that has been worrying existentialists , but they who have been worrying it .
One wonders what Tony Soprano would have had to say about that .

Advertisement Scientists from Queen 's University in Belfast have become the first to study an asteroid before it impacts with Earth .
The asteroid in question , 2008 TC3 , weighed 80 tonnes and had a diameter of four metres .
It landed in the Nubian Desert in Sudan last October , where it scattered after exploding at an altitude of 37 km .
Astronomers from Queen 's Astrophysics Research Centre observed the asteroid as it hurtled toward Earth and captured the only spectrum of it before it exploded in our atmosphere .
" This was the first ever predicted impact of an asteroid with the Earth and the very first time an asteroid of any size has been studied before impact , " said Professor Alan Fitzsimmons , from Queen's .

" The faint observed brightness implied a small size , which in turn meant there was little advance warning .
" It was important to try and figure out what type of asteroid it was before impact in order to give us a better idea of its size and where it came from . "
The scientists were only able to track the 2008 TC3 thanks to a lucky coincidence which saw astronomers from two institutions in Northern Ireland at the William Herschel Telescope on La Palma at the same time .
They were Sam Duddy and Dr Henry Hsieh from Queen 's and Dr Gavin Ramsay from The Armagh Observatory .
" Dr Gavin Ramsay from the Armagh Observatory was scheduled to use the telescope that night , " said Sam .
" When we realised this was an unusual event , Dr Ramsay agreed to help us observe it .
Larger impacts with asteroids and comets the size of mountains occur every few tens of millions of years
Professor Richard Crowther
" It was an exciting couple of hours , planning the details of the observations .
Performing the observations of an object that was certain to impact the atmosphere was a great but challenging experience . "
Dr Ramsay added : " These observations were technically quite difficult .
The William Herschel Telescope really rose to the challenge , demonstrating what a versatile telescope it is .
There was a great sense of excitement in the control room . "
Some small fragments survived the high - altitude explosion that vaporised most of the delicate asteroid .
Dr Peter Jenniskens of the SETI Institute in California , teamed up with Dr Muawia Shaddad and 45 students of the University of Khartoum to search the Nubian Desert .
Fifteen meteorites were recovered over an area 29 km - long along the calculated approach path of the asteroid .
According to Dr Jenniskens : " The recovered meteorites were unlike anything in our meteorite collections up to that point .
The 2008 TC3 weighed 80 tonnes and had a diameter of four metres " The asteroid has been confirmed as a rare type called F - class , corresponding to dark ureilite achondrite meteorites with a texture and composition unlike any other ureilite meteorites found on earth before . "
The spectrum gathered by the astronomers allowed them to establish the first direct link between an asteroid and the individual meteorites produced as it breaks up in our atmosphere .
Comparing the asteroid and meteorite data tells us that 2008 TC3 may have only spent a few million years existing in the inner Solar system before it hit our planet .
Professor Richard Crowther of the Science and Technology Facilities Council and chair of the UN working group that deals with Near Earth Object ( NEO ) threats said : " The search for and study of asteroids is extremely important as not all impacts are as harmless as this small one in October .
" Larger impacts of the size associated with the Tunguska event of 1908 occur every few hundred years and even larger impacts with asteroids and comets the size of mountains occur every few tens of millions of years .
" Any extra knowledge we can gain about asteroids will help us mitigate the potential effects of such impacts in the future . "

John Coale , currently advising Sarah Palin on running for president in 2012 , is a Scientologist .
And according to a memo obtained by Gawker , Coale once plotted to use friendly politicians to advance the power - hungry cult 's agenda .
Coale is a prominent Washington power broker and husband to Fox News ' Greta Van Susteren .
According to the Washington Post , he is running Palin 's political action committee behind the scenes and " guiding [ her ] political image in Washington . "
In 1986 , he masterminded a plan — which was never executed — for Scientology to get into the " MONEY and VOTES game " in order to " create power " for Scientology and win influence Washington , D.C .
[ You can read Coale 's complete memo and other documents outlining his scheme here . ]
Reached this morning , Coale confirmed that he had launched the plan for what he called the FLAGG PAC .
" I thought it was a brilliant idea , " Coale said , " but no one else did , so it never went anywhere .
I was looking at ways to move a new religion forward .
I looked at the history of Mormons , who had a lot of people in office , and I looked at the Jews , who were very successful and influential .
But the church did n't want to be part of it .
They did n't want to be misconstrued .
There was one small meeting with parishioners in DC .
Maybe 9 or 10 people showed up . "
Coale denies playing any role in Palin 's political career aside from that of a friend who e-mails her once a week or so .
And he insists that he has never used his political influence — in addition to Palin , his friends include the Clintons and Speaker Nancy Pelosi , among many others in Washington — to advance the aims of Scientology .
" I do n't think I have ever said , to the Clintons or Nancy Pelosi , or anyone else , a word about Scientology .
Not a word . "
The idea was to launch a political action committee that would attract donations from Scientologists but could be plausibly distanced from the cult , which claims to be a church and therefore barred from engaging directly in political activities .
The PAC was to be called FLAGG PAC , which stood for " Freedom , Liberty , and Good Government Political Action Committee , " but would act as a sort of dog whistle for Scientologists , who would hear an echo of " Flag Land Base , " the group 's international headquarters in Clearwater , Florida .
Its goal would have been to advance the Scientology creed , which calls for an end to " insanity " ( good idea ! ) and the abolition of psychiatry .
But Scientology also had a more concrete problem that a PAC could address .
In the mid-1980s , it was in the midst of a 26 - year battle with the Internal Revenue Service , which involved bugging IRS offices , infiltrating the Department of Justice , and breaking into federal buildings , to secure tax - exempt status as a church .
According to a document outlining FLAGG PAC's " Production Targets , " Coale hoped that the IRS could be brought to heel .
In January 1986 , Coale spoke at a Scientology " government awareness seminar " in Washington , D.C. , to pitch parishioners on the idea and begin raising money .
Attendees were given detailed surveys from the church 's Office of Special Affairs — the arm that handles public affairs and conducts covert operations — asking for personal data on any powerful political , media , or financial figures they may know so that the OSA could " better coordinate our activities . "
The documents identify Coale as the force behind the PAC idea , and as the point man for people interested in contributing .

from Locus Magazine , December 2007
Here 's the British playwright Alan Bennett , ending his review of John Osborne 's autobiography A Better Class of Person : " It constantly brings to life that remotest of periods , the recent past . "
I know what he means .
For the 18 months I 've been writing this column , I 've talked almost exclusively about books published before I started reading SF , and often about books published before I was born .
I 've been trying to articulate how good or dated they seem , what allowances a contemporary reader has to make , and how they 've become canonical within SF .
This time , I want to do something a little different : to look at some more recent novels that seem to be becoming canonical , and ask similar questions .
It feels ( at least to me ) a far more complicated task .
An author like Heinlein is absorbed into the bloodstream of SF .
It 's not quite that he 's been normalised  some of his books , like Starship Troopers , are so deliberately ornery that they probably wo n't ever be .
But someone writing in a similar tradition now  John Scalzi , say  is doing so in relation to works that are fixed .
If nothing else , the author is n't around any more to amend his body of work .
Whereas all the books I want to look at this time are by living authors , and some of the books are no more than five years old .
The occasion for all this is the reissue , by Gollancz in the UK , of eight of their backlist titles as " Future Classics . "
The books are arrestingly designed , to a fault .
( They do n't carry either the author or the title on the cover , using instead semi-abstract designs , often with no strong link to the content of the book .
If the Locus layout wizards do their usual thing and reproduce all eight covers here , you can have fun trying to figure out which is which . )
The oldest dates from 1985 , the newest from 2002 .
Five are by British authors , two by Americans , one by an Australian .
None are women .
Looking at the eight books , the questions that arise are in some ways the same as for Heinlein or Bradbury .
Are they " dated , " and do we have to make allowances for them ?
The answer is emphatically no for Greg Bear 's Blood Music ( 1985 ) .
It 's the simplest of all of them in plot : researcher creates DNA - altering virus in California lab , injects himself , infects the rest of humanity , transcendence ensues .
The exposition is frontloaded into the first few chapters as the researcher , Vergil Ulam , gets progressively alienated from Genetron , the company where he works .
So far as I can paraphrase the science  not very far  the first argument Blood Music puts forward is that our DNA is a language that can be spoken to and with .
Vergil 's virus stimulates , in the first instance , an intelligent restructuring of his own body .
There 's a fine scene where he has a medical exam and baffles the observer and his computer : it looks like his spine has suffered massive trauma , but it is in fact better functioning than ever .
But Bear 's second argument is that this change , once set in motion , ca n't be stopped .
The tool to remake humanity 's DNA is , by definition , a self - reproducing and intelligent one , and will necessarily outpace any attempts to stop it .
So much of the second half of the book is given over to a kaleidoscope of perspectives on the world - altering shifts it engenders .
Some of these are more effective than others .
I was n't so convinced by the adventures of Suzy McKenzie , a young woman wandering round a deserted New York : her story seemed too similar to many other cosy catastrophes I 'd read .
But another chapter , the transcript of an aerial reconnaissance mission over a North America transformed by the virus , is superb , as pure a rendering as I can imagine of what it would be like to witness the utterly strange .
The third argument of Blood Music is that beyond a certain point , alterations in humanity and its now collective consciousness will create alterations in the deep structure of reality .
Bear is fuzzy about why this will happen , and frankly I do n't believe him .
But by the point in the book where this prospect is on the table , Bear has built up such a head of steam that you just follow him .
The transcendence that follows has , as many readers have noted , an obvious kinship with Arthur C. Clarke 's Childhood 's End ( 1953 ) .
But Bear asks further questions about what it would be like to live inside such a singularity .
In doing so , he provides an earned " happily ever after " ending , aesthetically ( if not logically ) the only place the story could end .
Notwithstanding such formidable later novels as Eon ( 1985 ) and Queen of Angels ( 1990 ) , this still seems to me Bear 's most complete and satisfying work .
One of the interesting tensions in Bear 's work is between the American and British strains of SF .
Broadly ( and here I 'm borrowing from Brian Stableford 's The Scientific Romance in Britain ( 1985 ) ) , British SF derives from the scientific romance tradition of Wells and Stapledon , in which protagonists observe ( often in wonder ) but do not change the world .
In American SF , they do , and the future is something to be worked on , conquered , perhaps owned .
The difference , therefore , is agency : how much the characters do , and how much change their actions effect .
In Blood Music , arguably , only one action really matters : Vergil injecting himself with the virus .
Everything else is just playing out the consequences of that action .
Stephen Baxter 's Evolution ( 2002 ) is a pure example of latter - day scientific romance , which provides a panorama across life on Earth from 65 million years ago to the present , and then ( briefly ) the future .
The viewpoint is omniscient , the tone calm : " The turtles , ancient , had already passed the zenith of their diversity .
But where more spectacular creatures had perished en masse , the turtle had survived .
In a dangerous world , humility made for longevity . "
Individual actions are important in their context , but are subsumed in far huger trends .
A book like Evolution is , among other things , a powerful argument for saying that you can't read SF novels in the same way that you would Jane Austen or William Faulkner .
There are characters in it , to be sure , but differentiating them or representing the delicacies of their emotional responses is not the point .
The enjoyment you get from it is more like what you get from watching a really good nature documentary .
When Baxter follows the stories of his turtles or primates , he 's putting the lightest cladding of story on a scaffolding of research .
What 's remarkable is how successful Evolution is , how much one does n't mind its inevitable didacticism .
Baxter 's tone , with its echoes of Clarke and Stapledon , is a great help here .
About halfway through the book , Baxter is talking about early toolmakers :
Each lump of flint was a miniature cemetery .
In some long - vanished sea the corpses of crustacean shells had settled into sediment , and minute glassy needles that had once formed the skeletons of sponges became the nuggets of flint embedded inside the gathering chalk seams .
By that point , of course , we 've spent time in those seas with those crustaceans , and it's a sobering shock that even at this point , millennia before the current day , human endeavour is founded so intimately on the past .
There 's a different take on the past , and on agency , in Christopher Priest 's alternate history The Separation ( 2002 ) .
Some of the Future Classics were new to me , but this was the third or fourth time I 've read The Separation .
This time around , I was less impressed than I had been before by its central argument , that a peace with Hitler after 1941 would not have produced as disastrous an outcome as we might suppose .
The book follows the twins Jack and Joe Sawyer , one seemingly embedded in our universe , one in another wherein a peace is made in 1941 .
Perhaps my experience was skewed by having recently re-read Philip K Dick 's The Man in the High Castle ( 1962 ) , in the new Library of America omnibus .
Like Dick , Priest clearly delved deeply into the bones of World War II .
But although Dick 's novel takes place many miles from the European heart of Nazism , you never have the sense  as you do sometimes with Priest  that he 's scanting on describing the evil it embodied .
I think this is because Priest , as I said , is presenting an argument ; and in order to do that , he marshals the evidence to support him .
This is a long way from the multiplicity of perspectives that Dick presents .
Instead , we have the lives of Joe and Jack Sawyer relayed through their journals and other official documents , so that the crucial moment of decision is an abbreviated minute of a cabinet meeting .
There , " J.L. Sawyer , " as a Red Cross representative , argues the pacifist case against war : that it is always illegitimate , that it never produces the outcome desired , that violence in itself is so wrong that it should not be countenanced .
He wins the argument , and the deaths of millions are avoided .
So Priest 's novel pivots on a single decision , but it feels like a trapped decision : a judge summing up in favour of one side , but telling the jury it 's a matter for them .
That 's not to diminish the skill with which Priest tells the story , or the readability he gives the book .
If anything , my admiration for his technical facility increased this time round .
Each of the documents making up the book feels authentic , and justified in its own right , as well as for the place it takes in the larger story .
And if Priest 's intent was to make people think again about World War II , he 's succeeded ; he 's just not succeeded at getting me to agree with him .
After this , it was something of a shock to run into Greg Egan 's Schild 's Ladder ( 2001 ) , the only book in the Future Classics series whose presence I really question .
Normally , I have a very high regard for Egan 's work , especially his short fiction .
But this for me is the book where his cosmological speculations become so abstract ( almost aggressively abstract ) that there are many SF fans I 'd hesitate to give it to , let alone someone new to the genre .
In a sense , the story is very similar to that of Blood Music : a scientific experiment has unexpected consequences , and most of the book is devoted to seeing if they can be unpicked .
Except that in Schild 's Ladder , the experiment is in " quantum graph theory , " and creates an expanding area of the universe with different physical laws .
Inside this area , it transpires , new forms of life are created ; the central debate of the book is how and whether the two areas might communicate .
Part of the problem is that Egan 's characters are so far removed from us and our concerns that it 's difficult to find empathy for them .
This need not be a terminal problem , as he 's given us plenty of fine stories which feature characters in radically different situations to the present - day world .
More pressing , I think , is the level of scientific knowledge needed to follow what 's going on .
Without wanting to grandstand , I 'm the possessor of a rusty but by no means disused university education in mathematics , and I doubt if I followed Egan 's science more than half the time .
The first chapter alone has such a density of speculation about graphs , nodes , quantum theory , and cosmology that I might well have given up on the book if I had n't been reviewing it .
That would have been a shame , since those of Egan 's speculations I can follow  for instance on what life would be like in the new zone of the universe  embody very striking images .
As I say , the choice of Schild 's Ladder seems odd to me on many levels , especially since Egan 's back catalogue contains works which combine human stories and more accessible science .
Either , say , Teranesia or Distress would have been more understandable choices .
But as it stands , this weird novel feels like a scientific romance aimed at the highest level of scientists .
It 'd be difficult to think of a greater contrast to the chilly , cerebral Egan than Richard Morgan 's first novel Altered Carbon ( 2001 ) .
Fast , garish , kinetic , and violent , it demonstrates how far British SF has come since the days of the scientific romance .
The story follows the mercenary Takeshi Kovacs through a 26th - century future for which " brutal " seems too polite an adjective .
Some of the SFnal speculation is new , and some just feels new , but what matters is the energy with which Morgan presents it all .
A concept like " sleeving "  being able to dump a consciousness into a new body  doubtless has many antecedents , but you 're onto the next idea before you have chance to breathe .
If I have a problem with the novel , it 's with the brutality , the extent and the severity of the violence it depicts .
Morgan 's response would doubtless be that he sees the world heading in this direction ( accelerated by sleeving ) , and that he has a duty to depict it fully .
He puts the opposite point of view into the mouth of one of Kovacs 's antagonists towards the end of the book :
" I was young and stupid , " [ Kovacs ] said simply .
" I was used .
I killed for people like you because I knew no better .
Then I learnt better .
What happened at Innenin taught me better .
Now , I do n't kill for anyone but myself , and every time that I take a life , I know the value of it . "
" The value of it .
The value of a human life . "
Kawahara shook her head like a teacher with an exasperating student .
" You are still young and stupid .
Human life has no value .
Have n't you learned that yet , Takeshi , with all you 've seen ?
It has no value , intrinsic to itself .
Machines cost money to build .
Raw materials cost money to extract .
But people ? "
She made a tiny spitting sound .
" You can always get some more people , whether you want them or not .
They are abundant , Takeshi .
Why should they be valuable ? "
That 's all very well as a portrait of capitalism : a particular kind of capitalism , extrapolated far beyond the level it 's at presently .
And Kovacs 's story , as a servant of this worldview who learns better , is well told .
But I can't help feeling that Altered Carbon is a book that wants to have its cake and eat it : that it enjoys the guns , the explosions , the exercise of power while at the same time condemning them .
( I should add that of all the books I 'm looking at , it 's the one with the most obvious detail that will date it : people smoke cigarettes , and sometimes they do n't even feel guilty about it .
Wherever you stand on the public health versus individual liberties argument on smoking , it 's hard to imagine this particular noir emblem will persist five centuries from now . )
It seems worth considering the next two books together : Dan Simmons 's Hyperion ( 1989 ) and Alastair Reynolds 's Revelation Space ( 2000 ) .
Both are bulky space operas , both are the start of a series , both have multiple plot - lines running through them .
Yet they could n't be more different .
I first read Hyperion more or less when it came out , and remember thinking that it was an almost perfect reading experience , a demonstration of how great the possibilities of space opera were .
This time around , I was n't quite so impressed perhaps partly because I 've read the rest of the sequence and know which surprises Simmons was withholding here .
But it 's still an amazingly readable book .
It follows seven pilgrims as they make their way to a planet called Hyperion , whose " Time Tombs " are watched over by a mysterious and deadly creature called the Shrike .
As they travel , they tell each other their stories , Chaucer - fashion ; it turns out that they 've all had encounters with both the planet and the Shrike before .
These stories work as little samplers of SF 's subgenres : military SF in the Soldier 's Tale , cyberpunk in The Detective 's Tale , and so on .
In the process , they outline Simmons 's far - future world , one held together by a " human hegemony " , and governed more than anything else by the availability of matter transmitters or " farcasters . "
Some of Simmons 's bad habits can be seen in embryo here , such as taking whatever he 's read most recently and integrating lessons about it didactically into a fictional frame .
In this case , the influences are Keats and Chaucer , but he also brings enough invention of his own to the book .
The journey to Hyperion is expansive and vivid , and each pilgrim 's tale is starkly differentiated from the others .
( I had a problem with only one , that of the poet , Martin Silenus .
Silenus is a ludicrously self - dramatising writer who revolutionised the Hegemony with his poems about Hyperion , and then fell into semi-obscurity .
He 's so over - the - top  in particular in contrast to the other pilgrims , who mostly keep a tight lid on their emotions  that he feels like he 's wandered in from a different , cruder book . )
The real problem with Hyperion is that it 's only half a book .
Each of the stories started here is only resolved in the sequel , The Fall of Hyperion ( 1990 ) , and Hyperion is really just a set - up for that .
The ideal would be to have both books within one set of covers as a Future Classic  and indeed Gollancz have published them before as a one - volume omnibus .
It would n't be fair to say the same of Revelation Space .
Although it 's the first in Reynolds 's Inhibitor sequence , and sets up issues only resolved in later books , it stands effectively enough on its own .
It does , however , feel , if not dated , then at least pale by comparison with his later books .
The large - scale spaceship action owes an obvious debt to Iain M. Banks , but Reynolds has an interest in technological and scientific speculation Banks does n't .
The downside of this is that the multiple plotlines end up feeling too similar in their affect .
The obsessive archaeologist delving into lost alien secrets and the obsessive starship crew with their insane captain and hideously destructive weapons feel interchangeable .
And after the skill of Simmons and Priest , this book felt far less of a compulsive read .
In a sense , Reynolds 's book should be seen here as emblematic of what other British writers have been doing recently : taking the props of American SF and putting a distinctive dark perspective on them .
( The zenith of this so far is M. John Harrison 's Light ( 2002 ) , a future classic if ever I saw one . )
The end of the book opens up the sort of cosmological perspectives one associates with Stapledon ( or Baxter ) , but does so in a story where individual actions make a difference .
The reader can be excused for thinking she 's been messed around on the way to these revelations : in a book this length , the slow drip - feed of information about the central mysteries can seem arbitrary , a device to prolong tension .
As a general point , these Future Classics are very much longer than the Golden Age books I 've been reviewing before , scarcely any of which are over 300 pages .
The Reynolds is just the extreme example here of a more general trend : the books that you feel are somehow too long , which confuse word - length with scope .
Put it like this : you read The Stars my Destination , The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch or Fahrenheit 451 , and you wish the story would go on longer .
How many contemporary books can you say the same of ?
You may want to hear more about the world , but that 's different .
I wish I could hear more about the story and the world of the last Future Classic .
Paul J. McAuley 's Fairyland ( 1995 ) is , along with Blood Music and Evolution , the strongest of these reissues .
Its premise sounds rather familiar : we 're in a near - future Europe , and the book is mainly about the effects that genetic engineering has .
However , the execution is anything but familiar .
Early on , the book notes that , " Organic synthesis is still a black art resembling alchemy , in that operations have to be conducted in an exact and precise way that approaches ritualization , often for complicated reasons that are difficult to fully figure out . "
In other words , beyond a certain point , science starts to resemble magic .
As the book goes on , the metaphorical or fantasy ideas keep becoming literal : there is , for instance , a genuine caste of fairies here , but created through scientific means .
McAuley also has all sorts of ironic fun with that other venue of fantastic tales , ( Euro - ) Disneyland .
None of this would work so well , though , if it were n't rooted in a believable starting - point .
The novel 's first chapters are set in a grimly realistic London , plagued by terrorist bombings and too chaotic for anyone to care who really set them off .
Having this as his root - note enables McAuley to spin his baroque fantasies later on far more freely .
And unlike , say , the Egan , his scientific speculation is integrated into the narrative : he tells us enough to get by , but not so much that we feel trapped in a corner with a biochemistry lecturer .
In fact , having started out by wondering whether any of these novels would feel dated , I have to say that the McAuley feels more contemporary than many books published in 2007 .
That 's not just because it taps into the pervasive anxieties about terrorism or biotech .
It 's more to do with its willing acceptance of chaos , a world in which politics , technology , and the personal are irretrievably mixed together .
Despite the title , science offers no magic fixes , just new guises for the human condition .
A present classic .
There 's one leap of the imagination that 's especially difficult for me to make in assessing these books .
How would they seem to a non-SF fan picking them up as a first genre purchase ?
( That 's evidently Gollancz 's intention for this series , though I think the over - designed , no - rocketships - here covers will be a hindrance . )
With Schild 's Ladder , as I 've said , I think the density and specialisation of the argument may be too much for the lay reader .
But I 'm too far gone as an SF reader ( as , I 'm sure , are most Locus readers ) to unlearn that part of me .
My guess is that most of them will travel pretty well , though I 'm worried that a book like the McAuley , arguably the " best " as a piece of all - round SF may be too rooted in revising past works to make as much sense outside our field .
The Simmons probably is both accessible and ( in its full series form ) destined to be a part of SF 's canon .
I 'm less sure about the durability of the Morgan and the Reynolds ; both authors have done more complex work later in their careers .
I would like to think that the Priest and the Baxter will last , though both are odd books , even for SF .
Of all eight , though , I guess the Morgan is most accessible , not least because its influences are most cinematic .
But this sort of prediction is a mug 's game : the SF virus continues to mutate and you can never tell which iteration will be catching .
During a revealing Game Developers Conference talk , designer and Lionhead founder Peter Molyneux explained his studio's approach to internal experimentation -- and demonstrated a number of projects .
He began by thinking back to the company 's origins .
" We were sitting in a pub getting drunk -- that 's how companies are born , " Molyneux remembered .
When the team was only comprised of about 30 members and working on Black & White , " innovation was easy and cheap , " he said , but " it really was utter and complete chaos . "
During development , some extraneous ideas -- such as Molyneux 's intention for the in - game weather to match the weather outside in the real world -- ended up eating up lots of resources and taking focus away from core mechanics .
But still , the designer argued , " If I was a betting man , I 'd bet that what our customers really want is innovation .
They want to be shocked and surprise and awed every time they spend an untold fortune on that game at retail , " and the press " wants innovation , feeds on innovation . "
Furthermore , developers love to explore new ideas .
And if they are unable to do that within their existing place of employment , " What do they do ? " Molyneux asked .
" I 'll tell you what they do -- they leave their company and go somewhere else , because their idea is so smart . "
All of that is why Lionhead established Lionhead Experiments , a forum for small experimental teams .
" If you have a small experimental team that can spend a man- month , " you can do a great deal of experimentation , without being financially prohibitive , Molyneux said .
Such projects range from one to 12 weeks , averaging a four - week cycle , with teams of one to five developers .
Even lower - level developers can propose those ideas , but they must be " sponsored " by a senior member of the staff as a " shepherd " for the project -- that sponsore then pitches the idea to an internal Lionhead board of about eight staff that oversees the entire Lionhead Experiments program .
The company maintains a high - level prototype engine expressly intended for rapid creation even by non-programmers , tied into existing game engines .
Lionhead also has a structure called " concrete " that allows assets from one game -- say , a tree from Black & White -- to take directly into a totally different game -- such as Fable 2 .
Further off , Molyneux would like to expand that out to systems like AI , to allow prototypes to be quickly assembled in a modular fashion .
Later on , the board assesses the success of the experiment :
Why is it being attempted ?
How much would it cost to make ?
How often would it be seen in a game ?
How would it be taught to the player ?
Ultimately , the final question is whether the idea should be executed and put into a game .
Interestingly , in the past , experiments have made it into Lionhead games but ended up not being significantly used by the games ' designers , so the studio now puts more emphasis on ensuring designers are familiar with the additions .
" Where does the money come from ? " an audience member asked .
" Well , we do a lot of busking on streets , " Molyneux joked , then explained that experiments for a particular game come out of that game 's budget , while broader projects come out of the budget for Lionhead 's Central Technology Group .
" We generally find it rare that you can't justify it , " he said , since the teams and development cycles are not extensive .
" They 're very small amounts of money . "
Experiment Examples
After his overview of the process , Molyneux demonstrated a number of actual experiments .
He began by showing an early version of Fable II 's dog , which he himself designed and which ended up factoring heavily into the full game .
" This is probably one of the most valuable experiments we ever did , " he said .
Using the original Fable engine , the team asked itself , " Why do n't we think how the dog can actually move and be a companion to the player ? "
They decided to focus on exploring what a dog would do , rather than try to slot a canine into existing typical video game companion tasks .
This led to the mechanic of the dog running out in front of the player , rather than beside or behind the player as most game AI companions are positioned , which had a huge impact on the dog 's role .
A number of experiements were demonstrated in quick succession : one used the graphics chip to generate thousands and thousands of animated creatures ( which ended up not making it in time for Fable 2 , one that took one coder ten days to develop more advanced fluid physics effects , one about using lighting for shoft shadows , one that attempted emotive facial expression technology .
Molyneux then referred back to a talk he once gave about his frustration that more people could n't experience combat - heavy video games due to the dexterity required to operate multi-button controls .
Following the talk , a Lionhead employee told him , " I 've got this really cool idea for something called one - button combat , " so he was set up with Lionhead 's prototype engine to try and design the heavily context - sensitive systems .
That ended up being the core of Fable II 's combat --
" The cost was enormously high implementing that into Fable II , but the reward was massive , " he said .
Next up was something called The Room , which Molyneux had previously demonstrated at a past Game Developers Conference and which he said ultimately proved unsuccessful after spending a great deal of time on it .
Set in an elegant living room , it allows players to shape objects with small blocks of clay , which the game then turns into nicely - modeled objects , but also contains portals ( similar to those of Portal , but developed before the release of that game ) that not only transport objects in real - time but also change their size and other properties in proportion to the relative size of the two portal openings .
Molyneux noted that the portal technology can even be used to connect two different players over an online connection , but unfortunately , " it was n't really an experiment that ever went anywhere . "
Interestingly , some of the developers behind that very project ended up going on to leave Lionhead and form Media Molecule , which released last year 's LittleBigPlanet .
Anarchism vs. Marxism :
A few notes on an old theme By Ulli Diemer
More than one hundred years after the socialist movement split into warring Marxist and anarchist factions , there are signs , at least on a small scale , that people calling themselves anarchists and people calling themselves Marxists or " libertarian socialists " are finding ways of working together fruitfully .
Questions immediately present themselves :
To what extent are the old labels still valid ?
Have their meanings changed in the course of the last century ?
How solid is the new basis of unity ?
Have the old divisions been transcended ?
But is it necessary to re-examine the old labels and divisions at all ?
Would it not be best to let sleeping polemics lie and simply concentrate on working together ?
The problem is that a socialist movement - or libertarian movement : what terms can we validly use ?
- that hopes to develop has to confront historical , strategic , and theoretical questions .
A socialist movement worthy of the name has to do more than get together for simple actions .
It has to ask itself where it is trying to go , and how it proposes to get there : precisely the issues which sparked the fateful anarchist - Marxist split in the 1870's , and which kept the movements separated until today .
Political question which are ignored do not vanish , they only reappear with all that much more destructive impact at a later date .
They must be dealt with frankly .
But this does not mean that we are fated to barrenly re-fight old battles and re-live the splits and hostilities of the past .
The world has changed a great deal since the 1870's , and the experience of the socialist movement during the past century has changed the problems we face immeasurably .
Of no little importance is the re-vitalization of a Marxist current that is militantly anti-Leninist , and the re-emergence of an anarcho - communist movement which accepts ( although not necessarily consciously ) a good deal of Marxist analysis .
There is a good deal of common ground on which we can come together .
It should also be acknowledge that while the differences between Marxists and anarchists have been real , it has been the case that too often in the past the disputes between them have generated more heat than light .
A problem in many polemics is that each side tends to take partial tendencies of the other side and extrapolates them to be the whole , and in that sense misrepresents .
A serious analysis has to go beyond the simplicities of black and white ( black and red ? ) argumentation .
At the same time , it is true that posing questions sharply generally implies a polemical tone , so we should not shrink back from polemic if this means that important questions will be glossed over or ignored .
My own position is pro-marxist , and is in many respects quite critical of anarchism .
It is therefore imperative to note two things :
One , that there are many positive things about anarchism which I leave unacknowledged , because I am attempting , in this , and the subsequent article ( " Bakunin vs. Marx " ) , to criticize certain specific aspects of the total doctrine which I think greatly weaken it .
I am not purporting to give a balanced evaluation of anarchism as a whole .
Two : I am far more critical of the " Marxism " of most " Marxist - Leninists " than I am of anarchism .
While I regard most anarchists as comrades in the libertarian movement , I consider the very expression " Marxist - Leninist " to be a contradiction in terms , and consider " Marxism - Leninism " to be an ideology that is diametrically opposed to the emancipation of the working classes .
( 1 ) It is not possible to cover the whole anarchist / marxist debate adequately in one or two articles .
What I propose to do here , and in the accompanying notes on Marx and Bakunin , is to concentrate on the most common and basic anarchist objections to Marxism , and to examine them briefly .
These notes should be seen as just that - notes that make a few basic points .
I hope that they will provoke a lively discussion that will make it possible to examine the questions raised , and others , in much greater detail .
The impetus for seeking a debate on Marxism and anarchism comes primarily from reading a number of recently published pieces on anarchism which all seem to display an astonishing misunderstanding and ignorance of Marx and what he wrote and did .
( e.g. Bakunin on Anarchy , with the Preface by Paul Avrich and the Introduction by Sam Dolgoff ; Mark Brothers ' article on Anarchy in Open Road No. 4 ; the piece on Bakunin in Open Road No.2 , and P. Murtaugh 's article in this issue of The Red Menace . )
All of these - and most anarchist writings - expend a great deal of effort in attacking something called " Marxism " .
In every case , the " Marxism " that is attacked has little or nothing to do with the theories of Karl Marx .
Reading these polemics against a " Marxism " that exists mainly in the minds of those attacking it , one can only mutter the phrase Marx himself is said to have repeated often in his later years , only regarding the works of his ' followers ' :
" If this is Marxism , than all I know is that I am not a Marxist . "
If there is to be any dialogue between Marxists and anarchists , if the negative and positive aspects of the Marxian and anarchist projects are to be critically analyzed , then it is incumbent upon those who oppose Marxism , as well as those who support it or seek to revise or transcend it to at least know what they are talking about .
Nothing is solved by setting up and attacking a straw - man Marxism .
And it is important to understand and know Marx not only because there are " libertarian Marxists " but because Marx is without dispute the central figure in the development of libertarianism and socialism .
It is not possible to understand the development of any left - wing political movement or system of thought in the last century without knowing Marxism .
It is not possible , in fact , to understand the development of any ideology in this century , or indeed , to understand the history of the last hundred years , without knowing something about Marxism .
The political history of the twentieth century is to a very great extent a history of attempts to realize Marxism , attempts to defeat Marxism , attempts to go beyond or amend Marxism , attempts to develop alternatives to Marxism .
Anarchism is certainly no exception .
It originally defined itself in opposition to Marxism , and continues to do so to the present day .
Unfortunately , anarchists seem totally unaware - or unwilling to realize - that Marxism is not a monolith , that there are , and always have been , enormously different currents of thought calling themselves Marxist .
Anarchist critiques invariably identify Marxism with Leninism , Leninism with Stalinism , Stalinism with Maoism , and all of them with Trotskyism as well .
There is usually not a hint of guile in this remarkable bit of intellectual prestidigitation - your average anarchist simply thinks it is a universally accepted , established fact that all these political system are identical .
( 2 ) This is not to say that it cannot be argued that all these political system are fundamentally the same , that their differences , no matter how violent , are secondary to certain essential features that all have in common .
But the point is that it is necessary to argue the case , to marshal some evidence , to know a phenomenon before condemning it .
One can't simply begin with the conclusion .
But the fact is that Marxism is not a monolith .
Despite Murtaugh 's uninformed assertion that " Libertarian Marxism is a rather recent development , as far as political theories and movements go " , and despite the fact that the term " libertarian Marxism " is new - and unnecessary - the tradition goes back a long way .
For example , Rosa Luxemburg - surely one of the central figures in any history of Marxism - was condemning Lenin 's theories of the vanguard party and of centralized , hierarchical discipline three quarters of a century ago , in 1904 .
In 1918 - while many anarchists were rushing to join the Bolsheviks - she was criticizing the dictatorial methods of the Bolsheviks and warning of the miscarriage of the Russian Revolution .
After her death there were other thinkers and movements that condemned Bolshevism as an authoritarian degeneration of Marxism : Anton Pannekoek , Karl Korsch , the Council Communists , the Frankfurt School , right up to the new left of the 1960's and 1970's .
And even within the Leninist tradition there were thinkers who made contributions that challenged the hold of the dominant interpretation and helped to nourish a libertarian Marxism ; for example , Georg Lukacs , Antonio Gramsci , and Wihelm Reich .
A number of libertarian currents emerged from the Trotskyist movement in the 1940's and 1950's .
Any liberation movement that proclaims itself the issue of a virgin birth in the 1970's , or that acknowledges only one thin anarchist strand as ' true ' libertarianism through the ages , while cutting itself off - whether because of dogma or because of ignorance - from all other contributing currents , only impoverishes itself .
Yet anarchists writing on Marxism seem to deliberately and almost perversely shut their eyes and ears to anything except the dominant Leninist tradition , and so manage always to reconfirm their own prejudices about Marxism .
All this does not prove of course that the libertarian interpretation of Marx is the correct one .
But it should be possible to agree on a basic analytical point : if there is doubt about what Marx stood for , then it is necessary to read Marx , not to take the words of either his enemies , or those who claim , justifiably or not , to be his followers .
Once this is accepted , and only then , is it possible to begin an anarchist / marxist dialogue on a serious level .
My own attitude to Marx is not unequivocally favourable .
There are in my view serious questions to be raised about aspects of Marx 's thought .
Marxism , like everything else , must be subjected to criticism , criticism that may lead to transcending Marx , but not , I think , to rejecting him .
" Marxism is a point of departure for us , not our pre-determined destination .
We accept Marx 's dictum that our criticism must fear nothing , including its own results .
Our debt to Marxism will be no less if we find that we have to go beyond it . "
The essential point , however , is that the Marxian project must be the heart of any libertarian politics .
It may possible and therefore necessary to transcend Marx , but to transcend him it is first necessary to absorb him .
Without Marx and some of the best of the " Marxists " , it is not possible to create a libertarian praxis and a libertarian world .
Finally in judging Marx 's work , it is necessary to keep in mind that his writings and actions span some 40 years as a revolutionary , that he often wrote letters and made notes that represent partial insights which he was not able to return to and expand , that many of his works were polemics against particular doctrines and are one - sided because of that .
It would be a mistake , therefore , to take each sentence and each quotation in the corpus of his work as finished holy writ , or to expect that his work is wholly consistent or that he thought the implications of all of his theories through to the end .
Marx 's work is an uncompleted , uneven , but enormously fruitful and brilliant contribution that must be approached as he himself approached everything : critically .
At this point , it is necessary to confront one of anarchism 's tragic flaws , one that has made it incapable of becoming a serious historical alternative : its strong tendency toward anti-intellectualism .
With a very few exceptions ( e.g. Kropotkin , Rocker , Bookchin ) anarchism has failed to produce proponents interested in developing a rigorous analysis of capitalism , the state , bureaucracy , or authoritarianism .
Consequently its opposition to these phenomena has tended to remain instinctive and emotional ; whatever analyses it has produced have been eclectic , largely borrowed from Marxism , liberalism , and other sources , and rarely of serious intellectual quality .
This is not an accidental failing - there has been no lack of intelligent anarchists .
But anarchists , perhaps repelled by the cold - bloodedness of some ' official '
Marxist intellectuals , perhaps sensing instinctively the germ of totalitarianism in any intellectual system that seeks to explain everything , have been consciously and often militantly opposed to intellectual endeavour as such .
Their opposition has been not simply to particular analyses and theories , but to analyses and theory as such .
Bakunin , for example , argued - in a manner reminiscent of the medieval Pope Gregory - that teaching workers theories would undermine their inherent revolutionary qualities .
What happens when a movement 's leading theorist is explicitly anti-intellectual ?
The result for the anarchist movement have been crippling .
Anarchism as a theory remains a patchwork of often conflicting insights that remain frustrating especially to critical sympathizers because the most fruitful threads rarely seem to be pursued .
Most anarchist publications avoid any discussion of strategy , or any analysis of society as it is today , like the plague .
( Even one of the best anarchist publications , The Open Road , remains essentially a cheer - leader for anything vaguely leftist or libertarian .
People organizing unions and people organizing against unions receive equally uncritical coverage ; pie-throwing and bomb - throwing are seen as equally valid activities , and no attempt is made to discuss the relative strategic merits of the one or the other in a given context . )
Most anarchist publishing houses seem interested in nothing except ( a ) re-fighting the Spanish Civil War , ( b ) re-fighting Kronstadt and ( c ) trashing Marxist - Leninists yet one more time .
Even these preoccupations , which have become routine as to make anarchism for the most part simply boring , are not pursued in such a way as to develop new insights relating to the history of capitalism , the revolutionary process , or Bolshevism , for example .
Rather , the same arguments are simply liturgically repeated .
Rarely is there any serious political debate within the anarchist movement , while polemics against the bugbear of " Marxism " ( as essential to anarchism as Satan is to the Church ) are generally crippled by a principled refusal to find out anything about what is being attacked .
Arguments are mostly carried on in terms of the vaguest generalities ; quotations are never used because the works of the supposed enemy have never been read .
As a consequence of its anti-intellectualism , anarchism has never been able to develop its potential .
A movement that disdains theory and uncritically worships action , anarchism remains a shaky edifice consisting essentially of various chunks of Marxist analysis underpinning a few inflexible tactical precepts .
It is held together mainly by libertarian impulses - the best kind of impulses to have , to be sure - and by a fear of organization that is so great that it is virtually impossible for anarchists to every organize effectively on a long - term basis .
This is truly a tragedy , for the libertarian movement cannot afford to have its members refusing to use their intellects in the battle to create a new world .
As long as anarchism continues to promote anti-intellectualism , it is going nowhere .
Footnotes : ( 1 ) On the other hand , I do not see all " Marxists - Leninists " as counter - revolutionaries , as many anarchists seem to do .
Many ( particularly Trotskyists ) are sincere revolutionaries who do not understand the implications of the ideology they adhere to .
The fact that " Marxism - Leninism " as an ideology is counter - revolutionary does not mean that every " Marxist - Leninist " is a counter - revolutionary , any more than the fact that Christianity is reactionary makes every individual Christian a reactionary .
Nor are the political differences that divide the left always as absolute as they are made out to be .
There are of necessity always gray areas , where , for example , anarchism and Marxism begin to converge , or Marxism and Leninism , or - yes - anarchism and Leninism .
Life does not always lend itself to analysis by the categories ' them ' and ' us ' , if for no other reason than that all of us have internalized at least some of the repressive baggage of the dominant society .
All of us have something of the ' counter - revolutionary ' in us .
( 2 ) For example , Mark Brothers in his article " Anarchy is liberty , not disorder " in Issue 4 of The Open Road , uses the terms ' Marxism ' and ' Marxism ' Leninism ' interchangeably , and is either unaware or does n't think it worth mentioning that two of the three concepts he criticizes - the vanguard party and democratic centralism - are nowhere to be found in Marx , while the third , dictatorship of the proletariat , was given completely different meanings by Marx and the Leninists .
Similarly , Murtaugh ( The End of Dialectical Materialism : An Anarchist Reply to the Libertarian Marxists ) knows so little about Marxism that he does not even know that neither Marx nor Engels ever even used the term " dialectical materialism , " , which he blithely supposes " libertarian marxists " adhere to , and which he disposes of in four pages .

Inventor Patents " Tree - Hugging " Hollow Wind Turbine For Urban Areas
January 14th , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
Finding the space for wind turbines in urban areas is difficult — even for vertical turbines like Mariah Power ’s Windspire .
But a new design from Sridhar Condoor could drastically reduce the space requirements for wind turbines .
Condoor ’s turbine is hollow , cylindrical , and lacks a central hub .
Its hollowness allows it to be placed around existing objects — so you could literally have a tree - hugging turbine .
The outside of Condoor ’s turbine is fitted with inlets that catch the wind from all directions .
The inlets are toothed on the inside to drive a gear that powers an internal generator .
An inner frame on the turbine lets the main cylinder rotate freely , and also provides the option for the turbine to be mounted around other objects either vertically or horizontally .
In addition to minimizing space requirements , this feature could also help hide some of the turbine ’s “ uglier ” features .
Condoor filed for a patent on December 9 , 2008 , so chances are that he has a long way to go before his turbine is ready for commercialization .
Still , his design is something to keep an eye on .

What shall we do with the 17,000 drunken sailors ?
Survey reveals shocking extent of alcohol abuse in Royal Navy
In Nelson 's day it may have been the done thing to go into battle three sheets to the wind .
But a new report has revealed that drunkenness in the modern Navy has spiralled to such an extent that it could be damaging fighting capability .
Damning research commissioned by defence chiefs shows that alcohol abuse is a much bigger problem among naval personnel than among the civilian population .
Got a problem ?
In a new survey one in five sailors said they drank over 50 units of alcohol a week ( file picture )
In the new survey , one in five sailors said they drank over 50 units of alcohol a week – more than double the recommended safe limit for men , which is 21 units .
Almost half admitted to binge - drinking at least once a week , and about 15 per cent were classed as ‘ problem drinkers ’ who had been asked to cut down by bosses , friends , doctors or loved ones in the past year .
This compares with six per cent of men in the general population .
The researchers said that if the survey was a true reflection of boozing in the Navy , it would indicate that 17,000 Royal Navy personnel were regularly drinking to ‘ hazardous levels ’ – that is , to such an extent that it was having a direct impact on their health .
The research was carried out by the King ’s Centre for Military Health Research in London to assess the scale of the Navy ’s drinking culture .
The researchers said : ‘ Our results demonstrate that alcohol misuse is common within the Royal Navy .
Different era : Sailors being issued with rum at the Royal Navy barracks in Portsmouth in 1933
‘ It may be argued that the military culture makes service personnel especially vulnerable to the consequences of heavy drinking ; in effect , alcohol misuse may be viewed as an occupational hazard of military life .
‘ The direct impact of alcohol misuse upon operational effectiveness is not yet known .
But it is unlikely that this would not have a detrimental operational effect . ’
The researchers said that there was a tendency for sailors to ‘ alternate between restraint while at sea and the opportunity for excess while on shore ’ .
Last year researchers at King ’s published a study that looked at the drinking habits of all of the UK ’s armed forces .
It uncovered a worrying culture of drinking and suggested that it was driven in part by isolation and boredom .
But they said it could also be fuelled by a need to bond with colleagues after intensive periods of duty or training .
A sense of communal risk - taking and comradeship is thought to promote drinking as a way of bonding .
The Navy survey of 1,333 personnel found those most at risk were young , single , low - ranked sailors .
The results appear to show that efforts to curb heavy drinking , including alcohol - awareness days and penalties for staff who commit alcohol - related offences , have failed to tackle widespread abuse .
Defence Minister Kevan Jones said : ‘ I ’m well aware of the potential harmful effects of alcohol and there is no room for complacency . ’
The Royal Navy ’s history is awash with alcohol .
From as early as 1590 , a sailor ’s daily rations included a gallon of beer – and the further from home , the stronger the brew .
As the Navy ventured even further afield , easier - to - preserve spirits such as brandy or arrack – an Arabic spirit – became a common substitute .
After 1655 , when Jamaica was captured , rum became popular , and it was officially issued from 1731 , when a half a pint was deemed equal to a gallon of beer .
Jolly tars : Sailors enjoying a beer
Men were traditionally given a double ration after the strenuous task of repairing the mainbrace – a heavy part of a ship ’s rigging – and the order ‘ Splice the mainbrace ’ ultimately became a euphemism for any issue of extra drink .
Double rations were often served before battles .
In 1850 , the Admiralty ’s Grog Committee found , unsurprisingly , that rum was linked to discipline problems , and in the following year decreased the ration to one eighth of a pint – still potent , given that the official proof of Navy rum was set at 94.5 per cent soon afterwards .
To combat drunkenness , the Admiralty also directed that no officer was to partake of liquor until the sun was over the fore yardarm .
Rum rations were abolished on July 31 , 1970 , known as ‘ Black Tot Day ’ .

Excerpt :
' Most criminal justice data documents that in serious incidents females do suffer from more injurious and fatal violence than males .
However , as the POPIPV documents most IPV incidents are minor or there is no empirical evidence to demonstrate who initiated the assaultive behavior .
Contemporary unprecedented IPV training curriculums establish a bias found nowhere else in the criminal justice system .
IPV trainers simply refer to females as victims and males as offenders .
Some states have provided “ primary or dominant aggressor ” laws and IPV training that are based on what the POPIPV may refer to as “ gender clues . ”
The intent of the “ gender clues ” is to suggest to officers which gender is the offender .
These primary or dominant aggressor laws or training implies that when there is little physical evidence or it is difficult to determine who is guilty , the officer ’s should make an arrest based on the difference in size and strength of the partners or which partner of the two appears most fearful .

How well do you know your wife or significant other ?
After all those years together , are you confident in your knowledge about the woman in your life ?
Up until today , I would of answered yes .
Now thanks to those stupid Cosmopolitan magazine quizzes I am not so sure .
I guess my relationship with Cosmo is still not paying off even after all of these years .
You see , this magazine is the sole reason I chose to embarrass myself by joining the high school swim team and prancing around in a Speedo .
One evening I was covering the local swim meet for the school paper and noticed how the girls gathered around and read fashion magazines in between races .
Being smarter than the average bear , I reasoned this could be my “ in ” to girl time so I quickly learned how to do the backstroke .
At first the plan worked to perfection .
Considering I was like a brick in the water , this meant I normally had only swam in one event leaving me plenty of opportunities to answer questions on celebrity crushes , rules for breaking up with someone and what lipstick fits your personality .
The girls felt they were unlocking the male brain and I thought I was getting closer to an actual date .
Sadly , both of us were mistaken .
All the Cosmo quizzes got me back in high school was the friend card and a girl crying on my shoulder when their jerk of a boyfriend broke up with them .
Fast forward to present day and the results have me wondering how well I pay attention to my spouse .
I thought the only time I disengaged was on Sunday afternoons during football season , but maybe I do not realize how often my eyes glaze over and I go off to my happy place .
Thinking this had to be some sort of fluke , I Google “ How Well Do You Know Your Wife Quiz ” and decided to press my luck .
Some tests were so easy an untrained monkey could pass them causing me not to put a lot of stock in the results .
Then you had others that were more challenging than taking the SAT’s .
Their sole goal was to make the male feel like the ultimate goober of a husband so they would shell out 3 payments of $ 39.99 ( shipping & handling not included ) for the communication CD ’s they were hawking .
After a few moments of searching , I finally came across a quiz that seemed semi-legitimate with no hidden agenda .
Jenn humored me and followed along with this whole charade .
A few of the questions seemed odd like how many keys does she carry .
I have n’t the slightest clue if it is 2 or 10 , but I do know chances are good she has misplaced them .
I also think chances are good that I will be paying later for sharing that tidbit .
Some of my answers were right on point as they were no brainers : Jenn ’s favorite restaurant is The Little Dipper , she has been known to read cookbooks just for fun and would love nothing more than to replace the couches in the living room .
Unfortunately , there was a fair share of responses that had Jenn rolling her eyes wondering how she married a guy as clueless as myself .
I struck out on the favorite color question going for green ( it ’s red ) .
Ditto on her favorite clothing store ( Ann Taylor Loft ) and mother ’s maiden name ( do you think I ’d be foolish enough to post this on the Internet … ) .
This whole experience opened the door for conversations and taught me that no matter if you ’ve are a newlywed or have been married for 50 years , there are parts of your spouse ’s story you do not know .
Go back to those conversations from yesterday .
What dominated a large portion of the discussions ?
Presumably , you chitchatted about the kids , work , friends , weather , news headlines or what was on television the night before .
We center our sights on general issues while the important details of our life go largely ignored .
What chapters of his or her story are you missing ?
What is something they regret doing or not doing ?
What big life questions keep them up at night ?
How much do you know about the family they were raised in and the effects it had on shaping them into the person standing before you ?
Are they content in their career and purpose in life ?
If they are a parent , do they feel hopeless when it comes to raising their kids ?
Are there areas in their life where their integrity is compromised ?
What past mistakes are they struggling to learn from ?
Who or what do they struggle to forgive ?
In order to fall in love with Jenn all over again , I must begin to enter her world by asking questions that drive to the heart .
This requires an investment where my responsibility is being attentive and a student of her world .
Little details like knowing her favorite candy or how she likes her steak cooked are important , but pale into comparison to knowing her heart .
This is something you ’ll never learn in Cosmo .
Trust me , I read numerous issues cover - to - cover waiting to come in last place in the 100 M backstroke .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Citigroup reversed course Tuesday , a day after a Treasury Department official called the struggling company and " told them it was unacceptable " to accept delivery of a new $ 42 million corporate jet , a senior administration official said .
The move comes as new Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner tries to quickly bring more accountability and oversight to the much - maligned TARP program he now oversees .
Under that program , Citigroup has already received some $ 45 billion in government bailout funds , which is why a New York Post report about the scheduled delivery of the new jet sparked outrage .
White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Monday the president believes private jets are n't " the best use of money at this point " with America facing a financial crisis .
Citibank spokesman Michael Hanretta told CNN
Tuesday the company has " no intent to take delivery of any new aircraft . "
This came after the company initially said on Monday it could not comment on whether it was purchasing the jet , citing security reasons .
Hours later it reversed course , issuing a statement saying it signed a contract in 2005 for a replacement aircraft as part of a plan to reduce the number of planes it owns and cut operating costs .
" Refusing delivery now would result in millions of dollars in penalties , " it said .
" Citi is exploring all its options for these assets , including the potential sale or lease of the aircraft . "
Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) paid $ 42 million for the corporate jet , according to a source familiar with the situation .
The company will get most of that money back , but is likely to have to pay a penalty in the range of $ 3 million to $ 4 million , the source told CNN .
The exact amount and terms were still being negotiated .
The luxury jet that was to be purchased is a Dassault Falcon 7X , which seats 12 .
It is so exclusive that Dassault says only 21 are operating around the world .
It said the price is listed at $ 45 million .

Interview a donor and use their quotes on the donation page on the website .
Start up a dialogue with them using social media .
Ask them why they donated .
Give them opportunities to share their experiences with their friends .
Sometimes we have a tendency in nonprofit organizations to hold our donors at arm 's length .
We pat them on the head , thank them for the money and sometimes forget about them .
Rarely do we ask their opinion , even more rarely do we let them help .
Yet , donors are a big part of what makes any organization work .
So how can we get them more involved ?
Give them a voice .
Give your donors opportunities to share why they love the organization .
What ways can you do this ?
There are many advantages to connecting with your donors in this way .
Firstly , they will feel more involved with the organization and may be encouraged to donate more .
Secondly , you will recieve a bevy of information that promotes your organization .
I 'm not recommending you do this with every donor , but pick a few and see if it works .
How do you treat your donors in your organization ?
Sound off below .
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
With energy prices tumbling 20 % , U.S. consumer prices were unchanged over the past 12 months , the lowest inflation rate since 1955 , the Labor Department reported Friday .
In January , the consumer price index rose a seasonally adjusted 0.3 % , as expected by economists surveyed by MarketWatch .
It was , the government said , the first increase since July .
Energy prices rose 1.7 % last month , also the first increase since July .
The core CPI -- the measure of retail - level inflation that strips out food and energy prices to get a better handle on underlying inflationary trends -- increased 0.2 % on a seasonally adjusted basis , higher than the 0.1 % gain expected by economists for January .
It 's the largest gain in the CPI since August .
See Economic Calendar .
Over the past 12 months , the core CPI is up 1.7 % , the lowest rate seen for core inflation since mid-2004 .
Read the full report .
Most economists believe the annualized CPI rate will go negative in February even if energy prices continue to inch higher .
The global recession is forcing producers to slash prices in the face of falling demand for many commodities .
" We expect to see the headline CPI fall close to 2 % on average this year , " said Nigel Gault , chief U.S. economist for IHS Global Insight .
" Disinflation pressure is still intense and will stay that way for some time , " wrote Ian Shepherdson , chief domestic economist for High Frequency Economics .
Some economists are beginning to worry about deflation -- a general decline in prices and wages .
Even the Federal Reserve has signaled that deflation is now a greater immediate threat than inflation , although the U.S. central bank 's policy makers recognize the risks of inflation bubbling up again in a few years if they do not slow down the growth of money supply .
See related story .
Other economists said fears of deflation are overblown .
There 's not " even a sliver of evidence " that shelter prices are falling , which would be required to get to deflation , said Stephen Stanley , chief economist for RBS Greenwich Capital .
As long as the economy avoids the abyss of depression , " we believe that core inflation will accelerate as activity normalizes , " he said .
Details of the CPI
With prices rising 0.3 % for urban workers and average hourly earnings also up 0.3 % , weekly earnings fell 0.1 % in January on an inflation - adjusted , or real , basis .
Real weekly earnings are up 3.4 % in the past year .
Over that time , 3.6 million jobs have been lost , many of them in low - paying occupations such as temp - help and retail .
In January , housing prices were unchanged , with large declines in hotel rates and household fuel bills offsetting modest increases in rent and homeownership costs .
Housing costs , which represent 43 % of the CPI , have fallen 0.2 % over the past six months but were up 2.2 % in the past year .
Food prices rose 0.1 % in January , putting the annualized rate of increase at 5.3 % .
Prices of food purchased to consume at home fell 0.1 % last month .
Energy prices rose 1.7 % , including a 6 % increase in gasoline prices , while natural - gas and fuel - oil prices dropped .
Energy prices are down 20.4 % in the past year .
Although they rose 0.3 % for January , apparel prices are down 0.9 % in the past year .
Transportation prices increased 1.3 % on the recent move higher in gasoline prices .
Prices for new car prices rose 0.3 % , while air fares fell 2.1 % .
January 's medical - care prices rose 0.4 % , the biggest gain in a year .
Tobacco prices increased 0.8 % on the month .
A while back , I wrote a blog post about spherical robots .
I had taken it upon myself to learn a bit more about robotics with the intention of building a simple autonomous robot .
Well , over two years later , I ’m at a point where I can do some actual robotics work .
I look back on what I ’ve learned … and the rabbit hole of a trek that led me here .
The Coursera Rabbit Hole
What goes into a robot ?
Well , naively I thought that you hook up servos and sensors tosome kind of micro controller and away you go .
It ’s the Lego Mindstorms version of Robotics .
Of course , that * IS * one way to look at robots … but really , that ’s just the beginning … the “ Hello World ” program of building robots .
I wanted to build something a little more sophisticated than the “ recommended age 12 - adult ” crowd .
Well , for the answer we look to the Control of Mobile Robots class offered on Coursera .
In this class , Dr. Magnus Egerstedt introduces Control Systems .
The class itself does not get into the hardware of building robots , but digs into the abstraction layers necessary for successfully modeling and controlling things that interact with the real world .
What exactly do I mean when I say “ Control things ? ”
Well , think about yourself for a moment .
If you ’re standing and someone shoves you , you are able to react in a way to keep yourself stable and standing … or simply put you ’re in control of your body .
The act of keeping yourself upright is a complex set of muscle movements that need to be carried out correctly but you do n’t need to think about how to control each muscle … you just do it .
The instinctive impulse to lean or step is handled by your innate control system .
It ’s not enough , however , for a robot to be “ controllable ” .
My goal is to build a robot that ’s autonomous .
That requires some form of higher level artificial intelligence .
It turns out that Coursera offers another class geared toward exactly this : Artificial Intelligence Planning !
In this class , Dr. Gerhard Wickler and Professor Austin Tate take you through a survey of programmatic problem solving algorithms .
I was amused to learn that like all other computer science problem , artificial intelligence problem solving comes down to a search algorithm .
At the end of this course , you ’ll be able to write a program that given some set of circumstances and corresponding set of possible actions , it will figure out what to do to accomplish its goals ; assuming that some possible set of actions can achieve the goal .
This lead me to the next problem … perception .
An autonomous robot has sensors and it needs to be able to figure out some “ state ” of the universe in order for it to use its problem solving capabilities .
How on earth do you map images / sounds / echolocation to logical states of the universe ?
Through machine learning .
As it turns out , Coursera offers a LOT of classes on exactly this .
The most notable of these classes is Coursera ’s co-founder ‘s class on Machine learning …
Here , you learn all kinds of algorithms for automatically classifying and identifying logical states based on noisy or confusing input .
A more advanced class that I really enjoyed focused on state of the art Neural Networks .
The class is called Neural Networks for Machine Learning and is taught by Dr. Geoffrey Hinton .
This class goes into great depth on various kinds of Neural Networks .
This class totally blew my mind .
I have no doubt that the correct application of neural nets with the right kind of self - motivating planner will lead to formidable AIs .
Putting it all together
First let ’s talk about hardware .
Below is a list of hardware that I ’m going to use and I ’ll parallel it with what I feel may be the human anatomy counter - part .
I ’m going to use an Arduino Uno as the primary interface with all of my robot ’s actuators .
It represents the spinal cord and instinctive nervous system of the robot .
The Arduino is a very simple microcontroller that is n’t terribly fast .
It also does n’t have much in the way of memory .
It does have extremely easy interfaces with motors and sensors .
This makes it ideal for running a closed loop System .
( See Control of Mobile Robots class for details ) .
Connected to the Arduino will be a Raspberry Pi. The Pi will be the brains of the Robot .
All higher order problem solving will occur here .
The brain and the spinal cord will talk to each other using SPI .
Naturally the Raspberry Pi will be the master of the SPI bus .
As the robot gets more complex , it might be necessary to attach more than one microcontroller ( maybe not all arduinos ) … especially if I start working with more complex sensors .
The supports and overall skeleton of my robot will be created with Shape Lock .
It ’s a material that can be melted , shaped and re-used over and over .
It claims to be machinable ( using my dremmel ) and durable .
I imagine that if I need stronger load bearing parts , I can prototype in shape lock and carve some other material based on the prototype .
Wood is a likely candidate .
Okay .
The big pieces are out of the way .
Now the fun stuff .
What sensors / servos will I use ?
I have a variety of electric motors , solenoids and steppers that I picked up from Adafruit .
It ’s likely that my first robot will be a simple differential drive deal .. but eventually I ’d like to go back to my ideas in the original blog post and create a spherical robot .
In the end , the actual drive system and sensors do n’t matter that much … they ’re just the accessories of the Mr. Potato head .
All interchangeable .
Takes a certain amount of skill to cause that much chaos
“ We want to make sure that you look at the soil , the vegetation , the hydrology , so that you are improving  or certainly not harming  the natural ecosystem , ” he said .

Deon Glaser , a landscape architect on the staff of the council who helped write the initiative , said that LEED has requirements concerning landscape , which address issues like reducing runoff from buildings and barring development within 100 feet of a wetland .
“ But it does n’t have specific requirements of how to do that , ” Ms. Glaser said .
The initiative , on the other hand , goes into detail , specifying the kinds of plants , for example , that can be used to cleanse a disturbed wetland ; how trees can be used to shade a building , protect it from wind , prevent erosion and clean the air ; and what kind of plantings enhance mental health , draw people outside the building and even engage them in tending the landscape .
The Green Building Council “ definitely wants to incorporate those aspects of green design and construction into LEED , ” Ms. Glaser said .
But that requires a long review process , she added , and a vote by the membership .
Still , Mr. Mims said , “ we ’re hoping that it will be incorporated into LEED in 2011 . ”

Comments are being accepted until Jan. 20 ; then the guidelines will be revised and tested on pilot projects . )
IN its efforts to be more sustainable , the United States Botanic Garden now sends all its green waste to the Department of Agriculture ’s composting facility in Beltsville , Md. , or to Pogo Organics , a commercial composting system in Sunshine , Md . It also recycles paper , cardboard , bottles and cans , and sends plastic pots to a center in northern Maryland where they are cleaned , ground up and sold to a plastics manufacturer .

Midway remains financially dazed , but nobody is yet calling for creditors to " finish him ! "
Faced with a seemingly insurmountable debt load of $ 240 million , the Mortal Kombat publisher revealed in December that it had until mid-January to pay off $ 150 million of the outstanding credit .
Last week , Midway said that it had received a reprieve of sorts , reaching an agreement with a portion of its creditors to delay payment on half of the debt until February 19 .
Things could be worse .
Now , Midway has gained a measure more of breathing room .
Last night , the publisher announced it had reached a new agreement with its creditors , saying that the entire $ 150 million sum is now due by February 12 .
The publisher 's grim financial situation was spurred by National Amusement CEO Sumner Redstone 's fire sale of his controlling stake in the game maker in November .
The 85 - year - old media mogul , whose company faces mounting debt of its own , sold his 92.1 million shares for a mere $ 100,000 to private financier Mark Thomas .
The transaction came out to roughly $ 0.0012 a share , far below the $ 0.33 - per - share price the publisher had been trading at before the sale .
In announcing the first half of its credit extension last week , a senior Midway representative confirmed for GameSpot that the financial upheaval was not expected to affect the ship date of The Wheelman , which is expected to arrive for the Xbox 360 , PlayStation 3 , and PC on February 16 .
The recently released Operation Anchorage episode for Fallout 3 helped flesh out some of the game 's story , as well as introduce a new area outside of the Capital Wasteland .
The next episode , The Pitt , will look to do the same by bringing gamers to the ruined remains of Pittsburgh , and now we have a few more details on what we can expect in this new area .
A feature in the most recent issue of UK Official Xbox Magazine ( via CVG ) gives some of the first details on the upcoming DLC .
The Pitt will feature a new dungeon , but will also include a new settlement to explore .
This area is divided into two sections : the downtown area is home to the slaves , while the masters take residence in Haven .
It looks like the new episode will have players interacting with raiders for the first time — and by interacting I mean talking , not removing limbs — with a main quest that will see players take on the role of a slave to investigate rumors about a cure for mutation .
Additionally , The Pitt will also feature an abandoned steel yard for players to investigate .
Of course , the area will also feature a number of new weapons and pieces of armor .
One such item is the Auto Axe , which the mag describes as " a bit like a chainsaw crossed with a Black & Decker hedge trimmer . "
Definitely sounds like something you could have some fun with .
The Pitt is expected to be released next month , for both the Xbox 360 and Games For Windows Live .
Expect more details as the release date nears .

The AppStore has enjoyed months of success now at the hands of millions of iPhone users around the world .
The AppStore brought the ease and affordability of fun and useful apps to the fingers of Apple ’s Smartphone users in every corner of the globe .
There are huge amounts of apps on the AppStore from IM apps to gaming apps – but which ones did n’t make the cut ?
Would n’t you just love to know which apps were too ridiculous to convince the guys at the AppStore to give them a place in the hearts of iPhone users ?
Read on to find out !
• Obama Trampoline – Ever wanted to throw a bunch of American politicians on a huge trampoline and watch them bounce up and down ?
No ?
Me neither and the guys at the AppStore did n’t either …
Obviously the developers behind the game , Swmiware , are n’t too excited about being turned down and the CEO and President of the company , Patrick Alphonso , said , “ We spent a lot of time and money on this product .
It sucks to develop an app and get it rejected for reasons that you were n’t aware of . ”
• My Shoe – Remember when that Iraqi guy threw a shoe at President Bush ?
We all had our views over the whole situation and so did the journalist who chucked it , but apparently the game version of the incident did n’t spark any interest for the AppStore guys who tossed the game straight out of the window .
• I Am Poor –
There was a game that was released on the iPhone a while ago that absolutely bombed just days after it hit the AppStore called I Am Rich .
Perhaps the game did n’t do well because all it involved was to put a little icon on your screen – not the stuff of chart topping apps , obviously .
But the lesser - known I Am Poor did n’t even make the cut – the poorer game swapped the shiny icon for a pot of noodles or an image of tuna , as apparently that ’s what symbolises poverty .
Apple thought it was a waste of time and space and turned the idea out on its poor bottom .
• The South Park App –
One of the most successful programmes ever has actually been told that it ca n’t get its little app onto the AppStore .
The app was going to allow users to get a little closer to the cartoon that has been cussing its way into our lives for years , however Apple deemed it as being too crass for its iPhone users .
Meanwhile Apple are happy enough to continue taking profits from the show ’s sales through iTunes of course and the whole situation has left South Park ’s creators , Trey Parker and Matt Stone , dazed , confused and a little upset .
“ After a couple of attempts to get the application approved , we are sad to say that our app has been rejected .
According to Apple , the content was ‘ potentially offensive , ’ ” explained the creators behind South Park .
What ’s your favourite game that did n’t make the cut ?
Let us know what gems that are n’t in our list that you wanted to see on the iPhone …

TOPEKA , Kan. , Jan. 14 ( UPI ) --
Some 3,000 pets will be offered up for free adoptions at animal shelters throughout the United States on an upcoming day , the event 's organizer says .
Hill 's Pet Nutrition , a pet food chain based out of Topeka , Kan. , has organized Change a Pet 's Life Day for Jan. 24 to draw in individuals to adopt new pets and bring attention to the 300 participating shelters , USA Today said Wednesday .

" Eight million pets a year enter shelters , " Janet Donlin of Hill 's said .
" We are hoping that people who have been thinking about adding a pet to their family will take this opportunity to do so . "
The 3,000 free animal adoptions will represent the first 10 animals adopted at each of the 300 locations on Jan. 24 .
Hill 's is paying all fees for those initial adoptions , which can range from $ 25 to $ 300 .
A full list of the participating centers is available at feedingisbelieving .com .
USA Today said the event is being championed by " The Closer " star Kyra Sedgwick , who is promoting the event in a number of appearances this week .
" I hope people will at least consider the possibility of getting a shelter pet , " the TV star offered .
It ’s a sentence that Saddam Hussein ’s notorious cousin , known as “ Chemical Ali , ” is used to hearing , and Monday he heard it for the third time : death by hanging , for a 1999 crackdown on Shiite Muslims by the Sunni Arab - dominated regime .
Chemical Ali , whose real name is Ali Hassan Majid , also had been convicted and sentenced to death for the killings of tens of thousands of Kurds in northern Iraq in the late 1980s , and for a 1991 crackdown on Shiites in southern Iraq .
Monday ’s execution order seemed routine to both judge and defendant in the courtroom of the Iraqi High Tribunal , which is hearing Hussein - era cases .
Majid stood droopy - eyed in the defendant ’s wooden enclosure , a gray mustache shadowing his small , down - turned mouth .
The judge announced the guilty verdict and sentence , then tersely rapped his red folder on the desk as if straightening a deck of cards .
“ Thank you , thank you again , ” Majid said sarcastically as the judge walked out .

Another high - profile defendant , Tariq Aziz , the former foreign minister and then - deputy prime minister , was acquitted in the case , which stems from the Feb. 19 , 1999 , death of Ayatollah Mohammed Sadeq Sadr , a leading voice of opposition to President Saddam Hussein .
Government agents allegedly were the killers of the Shiite cleric and two of his sons .
A surviving son , cleric Muqtada Sadr , has emerged as the most prominent Shiite opponent of the U.S. presence in Iraq .
The Sadr assassination was followed by raids on Shiite strongholds to prevent his followers from gathering to protest his death .
Dozens were killed and their homes destroyed .
The judge declared the evidence against Aziz insufficient .
With Hussein rarely traveling abroad because of security concerns , Aziz , with his thick white hair and large , thick - rimmed glasses , was the face of Iraq in the outside world .
Two other defendants were found guilty .
Iraq ’s premier legal scholar , constitutional attorney Tariq Harb , said the finding was a promising sign for the government - appointed tribunal , which has been accused of bias against Sunni Arabs and others associated with Hussein .
The allegations have come from international groups such as Human Rights Watch as well as Sunni politicians .
Last year Sunni lawmakers demanded that the tribunal be closed .

“ The verdict today only proves that the Iraqi special court is neutral , non-political , and constitutional .
All the accusations made against the Iraqi judicial system are fraud , ” Harb said .
Aziz still faces charges in another case ; a verdict is expected March 11 .
It involves the execution of 42 Baghdad merchants in 1992 accused of price - gouging after international sanctions were imposed on Iraq .
Aziz could be sentenced to death if convicted of signing the death warrants .
Aziz and Majid have said the charges against them are politically motivated .
Majid ’s fate remains in limbo despite his growing collection of death sentences .
He was scheduled for execution early last year for the mass killings of Kurds , in which government aircraft dumped mustard and nerve gas on thousands .
But when the execution of two co-defendants was postponed by political wrangling , so was Majid’s .
The dispute has not been resolved .

Majid received his second death sentence in December .
He has yet to stand trial in other unrelated cases .
Those convicted Monday in addition to Majid were Mahmood Faizi Hazaa , a former intelligence official , and Aziz Saleh Numan , who served as a top official in the ruling Baath Party under Hussein .
Also Monday , former Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani arrived in Iraq for an official visit .
Iran has sought to strengthen ties with Iraq , which U.S. officials have increasingly conceded is to be expected given the countries ’ lengthy shared border .
The United States has long accused Iran of aiding Shiite militias that attack U.S. and Iraqi forces and of allowing bombs and supplies to flow across the border .
Iran has denied the accusations .
With violence at its lowest level since the U.S. - led invasion in March 2003 , the allegations have quieted , though American officials remain skeptical of Iranian intentions .

Rafsanjani is considered a moderate among Iran ’s political and religious leaders and has suggested that U.S. - Iranian relations could improve under President Obama if he avoids the hawkish rhetoric of the Bush administration .
In Baghdad , the U.S. military said a soldier was killed while on patrol north of the capital .
At least 4,254 U.S. troops have died in Iraq since the start of the war , according to icasualties.org .

Well , not all of them of course , but sometimes Persian gets a bad rap for being the official language of Iran ( plus Afghanistan and Tajikistan ) and so the only Persian you usually get to hear is some crusty politician or bearded ayatollah on the news denouncing something or other .
Plus except for Tajikistan it uses the Perso - Arab script , so a lot of people mistake it for some sort of variety of Arabic when it's really an Indo - European language , which can easily be seen in cognates with English like ( father ) , ( brother ) , ( bad ) , ( not , think German ) , ( is ) , ( to die , thinkality ) , and tons of others .
This video is just a few minutes of Deutsche Welle 's Persian news service with all the other voices cut out , except for that part closer to the end where she is conducting a phone interview and it would sound strange to just hear her asking herself question after question .
I still cut out most of the answers though as they 're pretty long , so it still sounds a bit like she 's really peppering the guy with questions but the real interview was n't like that of course .
The image in the video is Tehran in the winter .

Mr Mohamed has said he was tortured while he was held in US custody A UK resident detained at Guantanamo Bay has released alleged MI5 memos which he claims show government collusion in his interrogation .
Ethiopian - born Binyam Mohamed , 30 , told the Mail on Sunday they were sent to the CIA in November 2002 , at a time he said he was being tortured in Morocco .
His claims of British collusion are being investigated by the government .
He also told the paper he was held in continual darkness for weeks on end in a prison in Kabul , Afghanistan .
' Dark prison '
Mr Mohamed claims MI5 agents fed his US captors specific questions which led to him falsely confessing to terrorist activities .
In the first memo , the writer asked for a name to be put to him and then for him to be questioned further about that person .
The longest was when they chained me for eight days on end , in a position that meant I could n't stand straight nor sit
Binyam Mohamed
The second telegram asked about a timescale for further interrogation .
Mr Mohamed claims he acquired the telegrams through the US legal process when he was fighting to be freed from Guantanamo Bay .
Daniel Sandford , BBC Home Affairs correspondent , said Mr Mohamed 's claims would be relatively simple to substantiate .
" As time progresses it will probably become quite apparent whether indeed these are true telegrams and I think it 's unlikely they'd be put into the public domain if they could n't eventually be checked back . "
The Conservatives have called for a police inquiry into his allegations of British collusion .
Shadow Justice Secretary Dominic Grieve said there should be a judicial inquiry into the allegations and the matter referred to the police .
Mr Mohamed told the paper the worst part of this captivity was in Kabul 's " dark prison " .
" The toilet in the cell was a bucket , " he told the paper .
" There were loudspeakers in the cell , pumping out what felt like about 160 watts , a deafening volume , non -stop , 24 hours a day .
We abhor torture and never order it or condone it
Foreign Office spokesman
He added : " They chained me for eight days on end , in a position that meant I could n't stand straight nor sit .
" I could n't sleep .
I had no idea whether it was day or night . "
Shami Chakrabati , director of campaign group Liberty said : " These are more than allegations - these are pieces of a puzzle that are being put together .
" It makes an immediate criminal investigation absolutely inescapable . "
' Abhor torture '
The legal organisation Reprive , which represents Mr Mohamed , said its client was shown the telegrams in Guantanamo Bay by his military lawyer Lieutenant Col Yvonne Bradley .
Mr Mohamed spent just under seven years in custody , four of those in Guantanamo - the US 's camp in Cuba .
He was arrested in Pakistan in 2002 as US authorities considered him a would - be bomber who fought alongside the Taleban in Afghanistan .
But last year the US dropped all charges against him , and he was released in February .
A Foreign Office spokesman said : " We abhor torture and never order it or condone it .
" We take allegations of mistreatment seriously and investigate them when they are made .
" In the case of Binyam Mohamed , an allegation of possible criminal wrong - doing has been referred to the Attorney General .
" We need now to wait for her report . "

I think many of you like to see and to know details about their dream cars , especially if you have seen is the sixth generation of Golf GTI presented at the Auto Salon in Paris ( in 2008 ) since the time when it was just a concept .
In 1976 , Volkwagen Golf MK1 GTI was the dream car for the sport that he wanted something but not too expensive , the weather is equipped with a gearbox in four steps and a 1.6 liter engine that develops 110 HP .
Volkswagen Golf GTI MkVI
Today , when there are several days to reach the first distributors in Germany , the Golf GTI is equipped with a 2.0 liter engine producing TSI 210CP and a torque of 280 Nm .
It consumes 7.5 liters per 100 kilometers and emits 178 grams of CO2 per kilometer .
In exchange for these figures , I would say very good , the car gets from 0 to 100 km / h in 6.9 seconds and reaches a maximum speed of 240 km / h .
The model itself is longer and wider with stainless steel pedals , radio and navigation controls with touchscreen and heating in the seats .
After a lonely Valentine 's Day , let 's head over to the infamous Craigslist Casual Encounters , see if we can find some zombies to join some hot w4 mmm action .
I 'm clean and real , you be too .
As you can see , these ads were still active on the S.F .
Bay craigslist as of 1 pm Crecente time .
Here they are commingled with other lonely ( and creepy ) hearts seeking some nsa companionship .

This wintry week surprised Southern California with shape - shifting clouds hitched to chilly wind , rain in the valleys , snow in the mountains -- just right for a cozy Valentine ’s Day spent corralled around the hearth , logs ablaze .
Or is it ?
These days , environmental concerns and new governmental regulations about wood - burning fireplaces give some people pause .
Burn wood logs and you create pollution .
Burn natural gas and you consume a nonrenewable resource .
Residents are left wondering :
What is the future of the fireplace , the figurative heart of the home , the focal point around which we arrange furniture , the sentimental place where we gather families ?
New regulations apply to wood - burning fireplaces specifically .
In March the South Coast Air Quality Management District passed Rule 445 , which regulates permanent indoor and outdoor wood - burning devices , spokesman Sam Atwood said .
The rules , some of which went into effect last year , apply to Orange County and large portions of Los Angeles , Riverside and San Bernardino counties .
Since October , the estimated 5 million households and 16.5 million people covered by the district can no longer add an open - hearth , wood - burning fireplace to an existing residence or to their yard .
Starting March 9 , wood - burning fireplaces no longer will be legal in newly constructed homes covered by the district .
Only gas hearths will be allowed .
In November 2011 , the AQMD may begin to restrict the burning of wood .
Even if an old wood - burning fireplace is legal , using it could be limited , in specific regions , on days when air quality is forecast to be unsafe .
“ The ‘ no burn day ’ requirement is a pretty reasonable lifestyle adjustment for people , considering the beneficial impact on the environment , ” Atwood said .
“ The rule is in line with Denver and cities in the Northwest which have had these kind of restrictions for more than 20 years . ”
The reasons are compelling .
As more households grow conscious of their carbon footprints , it ’s only natural that efforts to recycle waste , save water and minimize household toxins would be complemented by attempts to limit the pollution we release into the air .
Burning wood creates tiny particulate matter called PM2.5 , which is small enough to “ lodge deep in the lungs and cause a variety of respiratory health problems , ” according to studies cited by the AQMD .
Still , some question the new rules .
“ It ’s a foregone conclusion that particulates are mostly placed in the air by other things like wildfires and diesel fuel , ” said Dave Laverdiere , owner and president of Boston Brick & Stone in Pasadena .
“ We ’ve done about 50,000 chimney inspections in 17 years , and the vast majority of these fireplaces are either unused or barely used .
I do n’t think people in L.A. are that interested in fireplaces , except for special occasions . ”
For builders such as KB Home , the new rules will have minimal effect .
Its houses have n’t included open - hearth wood - burning fireplaces for years , spokesman Craig LeMessurier said .
Los Angeles architect Andy Liu said most Southern Californians see value in a fireplace , wood or gas , even if they use it only once or twice a year .
“ People have a passionate attachment to the hearth , ” he said .
“ They want the visual experience of seeing a flame .
Even if it is done in a modern way , people still like it and gravitate toward it . ”
University of Arizona cultural anthropologist Kathryn
Coe went a step further , saying the hearth is much more than the focal point in a living room or a place for guests to congregate outdoors .
“ Fire is something ancient and deep within us , ” she said , adding that what was once crucial for survival remains an elemental need , even in a modern age .
The most common alternative to the wood fireplace is one fueled by natural gas .
Though not a sustainable resource , natural gas burns cleaner than wood , according to the air quality district .
Some modern designs use sustainable biofuel .
Existing wood - burning fireplaces can be converted to gas .
Another solution is a fireplace insert that burns pellets , said Rob Lewis , Pacific region president of the Hearth , Patio & Barbeque Assn. and owner of Canyon Fireplace in Anaheim .
“ Pellets are recycled and green , and offer controlled combustion and low particulate output , ” Lewis said .
Fullerton - based landscape architect Alison Terry expects Southern Californians to take the changes in stride .
“ There is a growing awareness among clients that green is the way to go , ” she said .
Terry expects residents forced to switch from burning wood to gas will understand the need .
“ It does n’t crackle or smell the same , but it ’s a fire .
People will still gather around it . ”

MUSIC NEWS - The head of Ticketmaster , Irving Azoff , took time off from the heavilly rumored Live Nation / Ticketmaster merger negotiations and responded to the outcry over the problems of their sale of BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN tour tickets .
Not only did Ticketmaster upset comsumers and a NJ state senator ( Bill Pascrell ) , they angered Bruce Springsteen and his manager , Jon Landau !
Mr Azoff stepped in and issued an apology after Springsteen 's official website posted a message accusing the ticketing giant of deliberately and misleadingly redirecting fans to their secondary ticketing resale site ( TicketsNow ) .
Springsteen 's team commented after many fans complained that when they tried to buy tickets for one his shows via the Ticketmaster website they consistently received an error message , which then redirected them to TicketsNow , where they could buy tickets on the secondary market , at a considerable mark up ( Ticketmaster , of course , receives a % of the mark up from their TicketsNow site ) .
Irv claimed Ticketmaster provides the link to TicketsNow only when their main site is unable to sell primary tickets for an event , either because they are not an agent for that event , or because all primary tickets are sold out .
He argued that TicketsNow provides an added value service for consumers wanting to get tickets by any means .
However , with regard to the Springsteen tix , it seems that fans were redirected to the broker website when the primary site ( Ticketmaster ) was unable to cope with demand .
Azoff quickly issued a statement apologzing , and pledged to restrict when the Ticketmaster site directs consumers to TicketsNow , and to only offer the secondary ticketing options when / if an artist approves .
He wrote : " While we were genuinely trying to do the right thing for fans in providing more choices when the tickets they requested from the primary on - sale were not available , we clearly missed the mark .
Fans are confused and angry , which is the opposite of what we hoped to accomplish .
We sincerely apologise to Bruce , his organisation and , above all , his fans " .
He continued : " We recognise that we need to change our course .
We have committed to Bruce and state publicly here that we have taken down all links for Bruce 's shows directing fans from Ticketmaster to TicketsNow .
This redirection only occurred as a choice when we could not satisfy fans ' specific search request for primary ticket inventory , but to make sure there is no misunderstanding in the future , we also publicly state that we will never again link to TicketsNow in a manner that can possibly create any confusion during a high - demand on - sale .
Specifically , we will not present an option to go to TicketsNow from Ticketmaster without the consent of the artist and the venue , both of whom work together to bring the joy of live entertainment to millions of fans " .
And he concluded : " If any fans inadvertently purchased tickets in the resale marketplace believing in error they were purchasing from the initial on - sale , we will refund the difference between the actual purchase price and the face price of the ticket .
( Please do n't abuse this good faith gesture - we did not give brokers any preferential access to tickets ) .
We are committed to helping deliver the most transparent and best live entertainment experience to fans .
We will do better going forward " .
They 'll need to , as the NJ Attorney General has announced an investigation into the incidents .
This recent incident should receive even more attention from the Federal Goverment and media , especially with a possible merger of Live Nation and Ticketmaster .
Such a merger would create a near monopoly in the sale of entertainment event tickets in the USA .

はちみつとローヤルゼリーはどう違うの？
ミツバチが作り出した自然の恵みはと聞かれると、まず思い浮かぶのは、はちみつではないでしょうか？はちみつは普段から日常的に取り入れている方も多いでしょう。同じミツバチ産品の一つに、ローヤルゼリーがあります。高級なイメージから、はちみつの高級品と思われている方もいるようですが、実は全く違うものなのです。
では「 はちみつ 」 と「ローヤルゼリー」は何が違うのか、みていきましょう。
はちみつとローヤルゼリーってどんなもの？
はちみつ
最も身近なミツバチ産品として知られている、天然の甘味料です。その作られ方は、ミツバチが花蜜を集めて巣に持ち帰り、水分を蒸発させます。その後、糖度を80％まで濃縮させて完成します。
ミツバチがどの花から花蜜を採取したかによって、味や風味が変わる特徴を持っています。ミツバチが蜜源とする花は世界では4000種類以上が報告され、日本だけでも373種類が確認されています。
ローヤルゼリ ー
はちみつの甘さとは対照的に、強い酸味を特徴に持つ乳白色をしたクリーム状の物質です。ミツバチが花粉とミツバチを食べ、体内で分解・合成したあとに下咽頭腺から分泌されます。
孵化した女王バチが最初に食べる餌となり、孵化後4日目からは女王バチ以外は食べることを許されない特別な食べ物です。他の働きバチに比べて、女王バチの寿命を40倍にも延ばし、1日に2000個以上も産卵できる能力を与える神秘的な力を持っています。
はちみつとローヤルゼリーの成分の違い
はちみつ
原料の2割が水分、残りはほぼ糖質です。はちみつの甘さの秘密は、グルコース(ブドウ糖)とフルクトース(果糖)が主成分となっていることから、原料の大部分を占める糖質の豊富さが生み出しています。
糖質はカロリーが心配になりますが、はちみつのカロリーは意外と白砂糖よりも低く、量も半分ほどで同じ甘さを感じられます。また、糖質はエネルギーの生産効率に優れ、ブドウ糖は脳にとって唯一の栄養となります。
抗酸化作用を発揮するポリフェノールなど、ローヤルゼリーには含まれない成分も種類を多く含んでいるのも特徴です。ただ、糖質以外の含有量自体は、ローヤルゼリーに比べ大幅に少なくなっています。
ローヤルゼリ ー
私たちの健康な身体作りに欠かせないタンパク質・炭水化物・脂質の3大栄養素を豊富に含んでいます。はちみつに比べ糖分が少ない分、他の栄養素が豊富含まれ、特に多いのがアミノ酸です。体内では合成できない全ての必須アミノ酸9種類を含め、全24種類をバランスよく含み、質の良いタンパク質を作り出してくれます。
またビタミンやミネラルの量も豊富で、ビタミンに関しては、はちみつの数十倍も含まれています。中でも美容成分とも呼ばれる「パントテン酸」、記憶力を高める「アセチルコリン」はともにビタミンB群の一種で、食品の中で最も多い含有量を誇ります。
特に注目したいのは、他の食品には含まれていないローヤルゼリー特有の成分の多さです。新陳代謝を促し若返りホルモンと呼ばれる「類パロチン」、抗酸化作用でアンチエイジング効果を生み出す「ビオプテリン」など、美容に嬉しい成分が含まれています。
さらに、もう一つの特有成分 「デセン酸」は、ローヤルゼリーの品質を左右する重要な成分で、ホルモンバランスを整える働きがあります。
はちみつとローヤルゼリーの効能・効果の違い
はちみつ
はちみつは、水分量の少なさと強いとろみが保湿に働き、高い抗菌作用が期待できます。
傷の回復を早め る
口内炎の治 療
虫歯や歯周病の予 防
喉の痛みや咳止 め
美肌効果
糖質を豊富に含むはちみつは、エネルギーを効率よく作り出してくれるので疲労回復にも効果的です。
ローヤルゼリ ー
ローヤルゼリーの効能や効果については様々な報告があり、中には確証の得られない内容もあるようです。そんな中、確かな研究によって効果が実証され、以下の症状への効果が明らかになっています。
高血圧の予 防
コレステロール値上昇の予防
糖尿病の予 防
加齢による筋力低下の予防
骨粗しょう症の予 防
更年期障害による肩こりの軽減
冷え性の軽 減
耳鳴りの軽 減
精神的不安の軽 減
美肌効果
肌の潤いを保つ効 果
はちみつとローヤルゼリーはどっちを選べばいい？
はちみつもローヤルゼリーも、ミツバチが集めてきた自然の恵みが豊富に含まれています。ただ、大きく差が出るのは成分の違いです。ほぼ糖分が原料となっているはちみつは、効果を求めるというより甘味料としての役割が大きいかも知れません。
一方のローヤルゼリーは栄養成分を豊富に含み、健康面、美容面ともに様々な効果を与えてくれる、私たちに欠かせない栄養源といえるでしょう。
栄養価で選ぶならローヤルゼリーがお勧め
ローヤルゼリーは、女王バチを驚異的に成長させる特別な力を持つ食品です。その効果を生み出す秘密は、何といっても含まれている栄養素にあります。
ローヤルゼリーに含まれるタンパク質・炭水化物・脂質は、身体のエネルギー源となる重要な3大栄養素です。これらをビタミンやミネラルがサポートとして働き、私たちの身体は美と健康を維持しています。
さらに、特有成分のデセン酸は、ホルモンバランスを整える重要な働きを持っています。身体が正常な生理機能を保つにはホルモンバランスの安定が重要になるため、ホルモンの影響を受けやすい女性にとって欠かせない成分の一つといえます。
女王バチが多くの卵を産み、さらに長寿でいられるのは、健康体を維持してホルモンバランスを整えるローヤルゼリーを、毎日摂取しているおかげです。
私たちもミツバチたちが作り出した自然の恵みに感謝しながら、健康と美容の維持のため、ローヤルゼリーを取り入れていきましょう。

DAKAR , Senegal 
A toxic chemical mixed into a teething medicine for babies has killed at least 84 children in Nigeria , health officials there said Friday , more than tripling the toll in a wave of infant deaths that began in late November .
The children died after taking a medicine called My Pikin Baby Teething Mixture , a syrup for teething pain , according to Nigeria ’s Health Ministry .
Health officials said that a batch of the medicine that went on sale in November contained diethylene glycol , an industrial solvent and an ingredient in antifreeze and brake fluid .
The chemical looks , smells and tastes like glycerin , a sweet syrup commonly used in a wide range of medicines , foods and toothpaste , and counterfeiters enhance their profit by substituting diethylene glycol , which is relatively cheap , for the more expensive but harmless glycerin .
The chemical causes kidney and liver damage , as well as attacking the central nervous system , causing paralysis that hampers breathing .
Children in Nigeria began to get sick in November with unexplained fevers and vomiting .
Some stopped urinating and many had diarrhea .
Across the country children with similar symptoms turned up at hospitals amid rising anger and panic .
The debate over pay equity is front and center on the Congressional agenda .
The first bill signed into law by President Obama , the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act , overturns a U.S. Supreme Court decision and vastly expands the opportunity to file pay and other discrimination cases .
Another bill , the Paycheck Fairness Act , has already passed the House of Representatives and is likely to be considered by the Senate in the spring .
Paying someone less because of their sex is illegal and two federal laws , the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , provide the framework whereby victims of pay discrimination can seek redress .
However , some argue that these two laws are not effective at eradicating pay discrimination and that the laws must be changed .
Central to their argument is the so - called “ pay gap , ” the difference between the average earnings of men and women .
In debate over the Paycheck Fairness Act , Rep. George Miller ( D - CA ) , chairman of the House Education and Workforce Committee , said that today women earn “ 78 cents for ever dollar that is earned by a man doing the same job with the same responsibilities . ”
Miller then went on to say “ if we are serious about closing the gender pay gap , we must get serious about punishing those who would otherwise scoff at the weak sanctions under current law . ”
President Obama expressed similar sentiment as he signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act into law .
To close the wage gap , Miller and his colleagues support punishing violators of the Equal Pay Act with unlimited punitive and compensatory damages .
They also seek to make it harder for employers to justify legitimate pay differences , make it easier for trial lawyers to create large class actions lawsuits , and effectively eliminate the statute of limitations for many types of claims , among other things .
The argument that the pay gap must be closed rests on the assumption that the pay gap is largely attributable to employer discrimination .
However , if the pay gap is to be used to justify such significant changes in the law , it seems entirely appropriate to examine the pay gap itself .
Does it really measure employer discrimination ?
Do other factors play a greater or lesser role ?
Economists who have studied the pay gap have observed that numerous factors other than discrimination contribute to the wage gap , such as hours worked , experience , and education .
For example , Professor June O’Neil has written extensively about how time out of the workforce , or years spent working part - time , can reduce future pay .
Likewise , economist Diana Furchtgott - Roth , in her book Women ’s Figures , has written about the decisions that women are more likely to make to choose flexibility , a friendly workplace environment , and other nonmonetary factors as compared to men .
Recognizing the importance of unbiased research on the pay gap , the Labor Department recently contracted with CONSAD Research Corporation for a review of more than 50 existing studies as well as a new economic and statistical analysis of the pay gap .
CONSAD ’s Report , which was finalized on January 12 , 2009 , found that the vast majority of the pay gap is due to several identifiable factors and that the remainder may be due to other specific factors they were not able to measure .
CONSAD found that controlling for career interruption and other factors reduced the pay gap from about 20 percent to about 5 percent .
Data limitations prevented it from considering many other factors .
For example , the data did not permit an examination of total compensation , which would examine health insurance and other benefits , and instead focused solely on wages paid .
The data were also limited with respect to work experience , job tenure , and other factors .
The Labor Department ’s conclusion was that the gender pay gap was the result of a multitude of factors and that the “ raw wage gap should not be used as the basis for [ legislative ] correction .
Indeed , there may be nothing to correct .
The differences in raw wages may be almost entirely the result of individual choices being made by both male and female workers . ”
The Labor Department ’s new report is clearly an important contribution to the debate over pay equity .
But where is it ?
Although it was posted on the Labor Department ’s web site just days after it was finalized , it was apparently removed as the transition in power was occurring between former President Bush and President Obama .
We do n’t know why the report was taken down , but certainly the timing is suspicious .
If the debate over pay equity is to be at the forefront of the Congressional agenda , then the Labor Department and the new administration need to acknowledge that the overwhelming evidence is that the pay gap is not based primarily on employer discrimination .
Disclosure of the Labor Department ’s report would be a good first step .
Oops .
Of all the charges levied during the debate over the economic stimulus package , Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal ( R ) offered one of the most foolish .
In a widely - panned national address , Jindal complained bitterly about " wasteful spending , " and to prove his point , highlighted " $ 140 million for something called ' volcano monitoring . ' "
Even at the time , it was an unusually foolish thing to say .
A month later , Jindal 's complaints look even worse .
An erupting Mount Redoubt exploded again at 4:31 this morning -- its fifth and strongest discharge yet -- sending an ash cloud to new heights , the Alaska Volcano Observatory reported .
Ash has now been detected at 60,000 feet above sea level , the National Weather Service reported .
The AP added , " Ash from Alaska 's volcanoes is like a rock fragment with jagged edges and has been used as an industrial abrasive .
It can injure skin , eyes and breathing passages .
The young , the elderly and people with respiratory problems are especially susceptible to ash - related health problems .
Ash can also cause damage engines in planes , cars and other vehicles . "
A USGS geologist confirmed to Zachary Roth that " a portion of the stimulus spending for volcano monitoring that Jindal lampooned has been slated to go to USGS monitoring Redoubt . "

A gene for dark coats is common among wolves in Yellowstone Park Wolves have acquired a genetic mutation for dark coat colour through mating with domestic dogs , scientists report .
Dark coats could help wolves adapt and survive in new environments , the international team argues .
Light - coloured coats are dominant in wolves living on tundra , but dark coats have become common among wolves living in forested areas of North America .
The findings come from a genetic analysis of wolf populations in Europe and North America .
" We usually think that dogs developed from wolves .
The work shows an example where dogs gave something back to wolves , " co-author Greg Barsh , from Stanford University in California , told Science magazine .
A trait that was created by humans may now prove to be beneficial for wolves
Marco Musiani , University of Calgary Natural selection has ensured that the trait increased in frequency in the woodland wolves .
But it remains unclear what is so advantageous about black coats in forested areas .
Tundra habitat is expected to decline over coming years due to the northern expansion of boreal forests under the influence of climate change .
As this happens , dark colouring could help grey wolves adapt to their changing environment .
Extinct breeds Co-author Marco Musiani , a wolf expert from the University of Calgary in Canada , who led the research , said : " Domestication of dogs has led to dark - coloured coats in wolves , which has proven to be a valuable trait for wolf populations as their arctic habitat shrinks . "
" It also shows that human activities can help enrich the genetic diversity of wild animal populations , which is a very unexpected finding . "
He added : " It is somewhat ironic that a trait that was created by humans may now prove to be beneficial for wolves as they deal with human - caused changes to their habitat . "
Scientists believe the black wolves appeared thousands of years ago after grey wolves bred with domestic dogs who accompanied Native Americans into the continent 10,000 - 15,000 years ago .
These dogs are now extinct , and experts on canine genetics generally agree that American dogs today are descended from European ones brought in over the last 500 years .
Blending in " We were really surprised to find that domestic animals can serve as a genetic reservoir that can benefit the natural populations from which they were derived , " said Greg Barsh .
" It 's also fascinating to think that a portion of the first Native American dogs , which are now extinct , may live on in wolves . "
More puzzling is the question of what exact advantage the dark coats confer on woodland wolves .
One possibility is that black colouring might help the animals blend better into the shadowed glades .
But Dr Barsh commented : " Wildlife biologists do n't really think that wolves rely much on camouflage to protect themselves or to increase their hunting success .
" It 's possible there is something else going on here .
For example , the protein responsible for the coat colour difference has been implicated , in humans , in inflammation and infection , and therefore might give black animals an advantage that is distinct from its effect on pigmentation . "

IF YOU want to send a robot to Mars , two space agencies are better than one .
That ’s what NASA and the European Space Agency have decided – so long as US law does n’t block the cooperation .
NASA ’s science chief Ed Weiler said last week that the agency had agreed with ESA in principle to join forces in sending robotic spacecraft to Mars .
If the plan goes forward , both agencies could fund missions like ESA ’s ExoMars rover , to launch in 2016 , and a tentative plan to bring a Martian sample back to Earth in the 2020s .
Weiler was speaking at a briefing about a …
Government investment in broadband networks has emerged as one of the more controversial parts of the economic stimulus legislation slated for a Senate vote Tuesday .
Already , at least $ 2 billion of a planned $ 9 billion for broadband has reportedly been cut from the latest bill , as legislators and interest groups squabble over who should control Internet infrastructure funding , and under what rules .
What should be less controversial is that intelligent spending decisions about funding for high - speed Internet connections can't be made without good - quality and transparent data about our broadband infrastructure .
The key public policy problem with broadband is that citizen - consumers and policy - makers still lack basic information .
The Bush administration set a goal of achieving universal broadband by the end of 2007 , then declared " mission accomplished " without providing much evidence to substantiate its claim .
And under former Federal Communications Commission Chairman Kevin Martin , the agency refused to release what data it did have about competitors in the broadband marketplace .
President Obama 's commitment to " change " has included a more hands - on approach to promoting broadband .
Throughout the presidential campaign , and repeatedly since the election , Obama has emphasized the importance of " expanding broadband lines across America . "
With input from his telecommunications advisors , the House stimulus bill included $ 6 billion for broadband .
Early versions of the Senate measure raised the total to $ 9 billion .
Statistics ?
Equally important is Obama 's commitment to empirically - driven policymaking .
In January , Obama became only the second president — after William Howard Taft in 1909 — to invoke " statistics " in an inaugural address , when he spoke of " the indicators of crisis , subject to data and statistics . "
When it comes to broadband , where are the statistics ?
The key public policy problem with broadband is that citizen - consumers and policy - makers still lack basic information .
The US spends more than $ 8 billion a year on statistics .
Much of that goes to fund the Census Bureau and data collection about agricultural and labor markets , such as the monthly unemployment report , which on Friday brought the grim news that the economy had shed 598,000 jobs in January .
Last week , when the Agriculture Department released its own census , Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack reminded reporters : " Numbers and data are very important .
They direct policy ; they shape policy .
They can tell us what we are doing right .
They call tell us what we are doing wrong . "
Yet almost none of this $ 8 billion in statistical spending goes to compiling information about broadband , the infrastructure of the knowledge - based economy .
And the data that has been collected has been made to mislead .
The FCC — the official record - keeper on private - sector telecommunications — for years claimed that there was adequate competition in broadband because the median ZIP code was served by eight separate providers .
The Government Accountability Office 's assessment of the same data found a median of two providers per ZIP code .
Worse , the FCC refuses to release the information that it has about competition .
A variety of organizations — including my own free web service , BroadbandCensus.com — have stepped in to do our best at collecting , compiling and releasing public broadband information .
We believe that if you want to build a road , you need a map that tells you where existing roads lie before you begin taking construction bids , let alone start pouring concrete .
Where will our nation 's new broadband highways , by - ways and access points be built ?
Who 's going to let the contracts ?
Who will own this infrastructure ?
These questions can't be answered without detailed broadband data .
To that end , I 've supported a proposed " State Broadband Planning and Assessment Act , " which could be introduced as an amendment to the fiscal stimulus measure .
The goal of this effort , as of BroadbandCensus.com , is to unleash the Internet as means of sharing information about the Internet itself .
For two - and - a - half years , I 've been trying to get access to basic broadband data for the public , including citizen - consumers , businesses , and local policy - makers .
I 've been seeking to identify which carriers offer service in a particular ZIP code , as well as smaller units , like census blocks .
In September 2006 , when I headed a project at the Center for Public Integrity that investigated the telecommunications industry , we filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the FCC to force them to release basic broadband data about carriers by ZIP code .
The project obtained and displayed similar location information about broadcasters and cable operators from the FCC 's cumbersome web site .
But our attempts to get broadband data were thwarted by the FCC and by industry .
AT&T , Verizon Communications , and the lobbying organizations representing the Bell companies , the cable companies , the cell phone carriers , and wireless broadband providers all asked the FCC to deny information to the public .
Even though every consumer who buys broadband knows the name of the company that provides them with service , the telecoms argued that compiling this information into a single location would reveal " proprietary " data .
The FCC agreed .
Tickets to see The Rolling Stones in Toronto on Wednesday cost £ 4.60
" It 's not aimed , personally aimed , at President Bush , " he said .
" It would n't be called Sweet Neo Con if it was . "
The singer told US TV show Extra : " It 's not really aimed at anyone . "
On the track , he sings : " You call yourself a Christian , I call you a hypocrite . "
The band kicked off their latest world tour with an intimate gig in Toronto , Canada , on Wednesday .
For just C$ 10 ( £ 4.60 , US $ 8.35 ) a ticket , 1,000 fans at the Phoenix Theatre saw the rock legends warm up for their A Bigger Bang stadium tour .
' Home from home '
The band will play more than 40 shows in the US and Canada in the next five months before moving on to Mexico , South America , the Far East before reaching Europe next summer .
They often rehearse and perform in Toronto , a city they describe as a " home away from home " .
Wednesday 's gig saw them perform new songs as well as classics including Brown Sugar , Jumpin ' Jack Flash and a cover of Bob Marley 's Get Up , Stand Up .
Their new album , also titled A Bigger Bang , will be released next month .
Support acts on their tour will include Joss Stone , Black Eyed Peas , Metallica , Maroon 5 and Pearl Jam .
