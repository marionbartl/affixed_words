recently revealed that the mortgage on his home had been foreclosed , and he blamed two costly divorces for his financial woes .
Because the dude has to pay the bills , he has turned to celebrity boxing .
Federal tax law , as it relates to tax - exempt religious ministries , is pretty clear — houses of worship may not legally intervene in political campaigns , either in support of or opposition to a candidate or a party .
Those who violate the law run the risk of losing their tax - exempt status .
With some regularity , the IRS reminds houses of worship about this , warning them about the dangers of ignoring the law .
A far - right group in Arizona , however , has an idea : conservative churches should ignore the law — and in the process , test the law — on purpose .
A conservative legal - advocacy group is enlisting ministers to use their pulpits to preach about election candidates this September , defying a tax law that bars churches from engaging in politics .
Alliance Defense Fund , a Scottsdale , Ariz. , nonprofit , is hoping at least one sermon will prompt the Internal Revenue Service to investigate , sparking a court battle that could get the tax provision declared unconstitutional .
Those ministers the ADF are targeting need to think long and hard about this , because they 're playing a game they 're going to lose here .
A devastated scene at Johri Bazar after the serial blasts rocked Jaipur .
( PTI Photo )
JAIPUR : Terror struck yet again ��� this time in Jaipur , at the busiest market , at the busiest hour , aimed with chilling precision to kill , maim , terrify and cleave the country .
At last count , the toll was 80 killed , and with over 150 injured , it could go up .
( Watch ) The first blast took place at 7.20 pm on Tuesday in the crowded Johari Bazaar and within 15 minutes seven more blasts occurred in adjoining areas in the walled city ��� near the Hanuman Mandir , which was milling with devotees , near Hawa Mahal , at Badi Chaupad , Tripolia Bazar and Chandpole .
Within minutes , the entire market was a picture of total chaos .
People ran screaming , jumping over dead bodies and severed limbs , skirting mangled rickshaws and damaged cars .
The piercing wail of ambulance sirens replaced the firecrackers that would go off every other day in Jaipur to celebrate its victorious Rajasthan Royals T20 team .
Terrorists displaying the telltale tactics of Lashkar - e - Taiba and SIMI struck with bombs planted on cycles and cycle - rickshaws .
In the past three years , this is the 21st terror attack outside Jammu & Kashmir .
Chief minister Vasundhara Raje said , " We will not tolerate this .
" Police later arrested a man from Mumbai .
Rajasthan 's director general of police , A S Gill , said the attacks were designed to cause maximum damage and the sites had been picked with care .
He confirmed that bombs had been planted on brand - new Avon cycles .
Similar cycle blasts on September 8 , 2006 , in Malegaon , Maharashtra , had killed 38 people during a Muslim festival day .
Bombs on cycles were also used for the attack on the Faizabad court .
The Malegaon attacks were blamed on LeT and the banned Students ' Islamic Movement of India .
The Jaipur attack might have been worse had three unexploded bombs not been defused in the walled city area .
Another bomb was defused in the upmarket Raja Park area , triggering fresh fears .
Mercifully , the city was keeping calm .
Psystar and its Open Computer / OpenPro have stirred up a frenzy in the Mac ecosystem .
While our forums overflow with references to the mythical " xMac " — generally agreed to be a smaller , expandable , and less - expensive Mac tower — Apple has given no indication of being interested in producing such a product .
Meanwhile , tinkerers and hackers are building " Hackintoshes , " custom - built PCs that run a hacked version of Leopard .
Psystar clearly saw a market opportunity and is trying to cash in on it .
Apple has not responded to our requests for comment over Psystar and its " open " computers .
However , we were able to get some feedback from our other favorite Apple co-founder : Steve Wozniak .
We talked about the cloning days of yore , when Power Computing made rather vanilla - looking PCs that had PPC 600 - series processors and ran System 7 .
Psystar 's efforts are somewhat similar , " except not with Apple 's blessing , " says Woz .
But , there is that questionable legality .
Mac OS X's EULA specifically forbids running the software on non-Apple hardware .
But , according to an article at Wired.com , breaking a EULA is n't so easy to lay the smackdown over .
A lawyer that Wired contacted said , " Generally speaking , these user agreements are much weaker than other forms of litigation .
Companies make them as broad as possible but there 's no way to basically enforce them . "
So Apple will most likely fight back with technology , not legal briefs .
Woz agrees .
" I 'm sure that when Apple went Intel , they included copyright code in a ROM that is necessary , " he told Ars .
This is probably located in an Intel - based Mac's EFI boot ROM .
But Psystar 's machines are purported to emulate the Mac's EFI .
This is where
Woz thinks it wo n't work in the long - term .
" You have a right to run Mac Software on any non-Apple computer , but you do n't have the right to copy codes that are built into Apple 's hardware , so you are stuck , " he said .
Most likely , Apple will add a tweak to a Leopard update and it will break compatibility with the OpenPro .
After all , Apple is under no obligation to ensure compatibility with non-Apple hardware .
In the end , the OpenPro is an interesting product , even if just from a curiosity standpoint .
We will have to see if Psystar is able to actually ship the computers , though , and if customers will be satisfied with their purchase .
If so , Woz might give it a chance .

" On Money : " " A Candid Proposal to Change Public Policy " by Paul Andrew Mitchell , B.A. , M.S. Counselor at Law , Federal Witness , Private Attorney General , and Candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives July 15 , 1998 Assume for the moment that the Congress can be persuaded to face the cruel facts , and to abolish the federal income tax completely ( because those tax revenues are not paying for ANY government services whatsoever ) and replace it with nothing at all ( not even a national sales tax ) .
Where does this action leave us , as a nation and as an economy ?
The answer is important and also difficult , because of the economic complexities that were introduced by the Federal Reserve System .
In the book entitled " The Federal Zone , " the IRS and the Federal Reserve Banks are likened to two pumps , working in tandem : the banks pump money and credit INTO the economy , and the IRS pumps ( sucks ? ) money and credit OUT of the economy .
The real economic reason for having an IRS , in its present configuration , is to maintain the purchasing power of Federal Reserve Notes .
If FRN's were allowed to flood the marketplace , without a counter - balancing force to remove them from the marketplace , we would experience the very same hyper- inflation which plagued Germany after World War I .
Thus , it is clear that , to stop this essential connection , the two pumps must be stopped at approximately the same time .
Only a very few , quite brave Americans have had enough courage and insight to face a solution which may not be too obvious to those who are less educated about monetary systems , and monetary fraud .
This solution is , very simply , that the foreign banks who have extracted immense wealth from America , via the federal income tax , must now " eat " the Treasury Bonds which they purchased with money they created out of thin air , quite literally .
Remember , the FRB pays Printing and Engraving less than 3 cents per FRN , REGARDLESS OF THE DENOMINATION on each FRN .
Then , FRB obtains a legal lien on collateral equal to the face value of the FRN , PLUS INTEREST .
Thus , for a total cost of 3 cents ( $ 0.03 ) , FRB gets to collect about $ 107.50 from our economy ( assuming 7.5 % interest on a $ 100 FRN ) .
This much leverage is obviously unjust enrichment , because the $ 0.03 " cost " is also created out of thin air .
The crucial connection which must be recognized is that FRN's do not get created now , until and unless the debt ceiling is raised .
Put in simpler words , FRN's do not get created , until and unless more Treasury Bonds are sold , and FRB gets preferential treatment on the purchase of such bonds .
Thus , to break the cycle of monetary fraud , cash must be created without also increasing the federal debt , without also authorizing the issuance and sale of additional Treasury Bonds , and without also increasing inflation .
Remember , higher prices are not the " cause " of inflation ; higher prices are the " effect " of inflation , which is defined to be a disproportionate increase in the money supply , relative to the amount of goods and services being exchanged .
The solution which JFK devised , was to authorize the printing of " U.S. Notes " ( the ones with the distinctive " red dot " Treasury emblem ) .
Some believe that it was this action , among others , which cost JFK his life .
U.S. Notes were a straightforward solution to eliminating the connection between cash creation and debt ceiling increases .
JFK's U.S. Notes were NOT created at the expense of additional debts payable to foreign banks , via the Treasury Bonds which would normally have been sold to those banks .
Despite the obvious risks inherent in this solution , it remains a viable one , whether or not those U.S. Notes are actually redeemable .
Please defer , for the moment , the question of redemption .
The main advantage which U.S. Notes have over Federal Reserve Notes , is that the former have no interest expense attached to them , whereas the latter do have an interest expense attached to them ( in addition to the problem of the FRB 's huge leverage , discussed above ) .
Another , quite similar solution is to issue " Silver Bonds " which are Treasury Bonds that are only redeemable in silver substance , at their maturity date .
A proposal was made last year to issue Silver Bonds with 1- , 2 - , and 3 - year maturities , and interest rates slightly above market rates .
This program would be coupled with an aggressive federal government program to mint large numbers of silver dollars ( not the " clad " coins we currently use ) .
Those individuals and companies who had raw silver to sell to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing , would be paid in bank credit , Silver Bonds , or U.S. Notes , but NOT in FRN's .
The other aspect of this program would be to recall Federal Reserve Notes on a one - to - one basis with new U.S. Notes , " over - the - counter " ( i.e. no bank accounts , cash transaction reports , or SSN 's required ) .
FRN 's would be treated as " bearer bonds " ( for those of you who know the meaning of that term ) .
Once the silver coin production is ramped up , Congress can deliver on its promise to redeem Silver Bonds when they mature .
Later , as the supply of FRN 's dwindles and the corresponding supply of U.S. Notes increases , Congress would be asked to phase in a redeemable U.S. Note , in a fashion which eases the transition to a redeemable currency .
Silver bonds would be very attractive investments for public agencies , like state governments and their political subdivisions .
At maturity , of course , Silver Bonds could be used to purchase more Silver Bonds .
The quantity of Silver Bonds to be issued , would be controlled by the amount of silver dollars to be minted ; clearly , this is the kind of determination which Congress has constitutional authority to make .
The major problem which must be solved , under this new national policy , is the massive " skew " which is present in the substantive equivalent of the FRN .
One silver " dollar " today buys about seven ( 7 ) Federal Reserve Notes .
As long as the FRN circulates , and as long as such a skew exists , people will be better off to trade their silver for FRN's , because they get 7 FRN 's for each silver dollar .
Obviously , if you are buying milk and bread , you are much better off to be holding FRN's , because you have SEVEN TIMES as much purchasing power as you would have by holding silver , in the same " nominal " amounts .
( " Nominal " here means " face value " . )
Forcing people to exchange FRN's for silver , in nominal amounts , results in stealing huge amounts of money from the people who possess those FRN's .
That is the major reason why U.S. Notes are printed -- to moderate the FRN 's inevitable devaluation to zero .
Thus , the withdrawal of FRN's from the entire economy represents a massive , one - time economic adjustment which must occur , if we are to return to constitutional money in America .
The proper place for an open and candid discussion of the consequences , would be the committee which conducts hearings on the legislation that must be enacted , for this program to go into effect .
Without more study , it is impossible to be exact about the magnitude and distribution of " damages . "
But , take this one example : John Doe is persuaded to spend $ 100 FRN's on a silver bond , which matures at , say , 5 % in one year .
One year later , he gets $ 105 in silver dollars .
He then turns around and exchanges them for $ 735 in FRN's ( because the FRN's are still circulating at 7 - to - 1 ) .
Then , he goes to the counter of his friendly local bank , and exchanges the FRN's for U.S. Notes , one - for - one .
Clearly , this is not the kind of " appreciation " which Congress would , or should , intend .
Conversely , if the exchanges flow in the opposite direction , Congress should never " force " such a massive devaluation in the common man 's purchasing power .
The federal income tax has already done enough of that , for the past 85 years !!
The new national " policy " is to keep the money in our country .
Putting a future " kill " date on the FRN only aggravates the problem I have described above , because people will not be able to " defer " their decisions after that deadline .
As of a particular date , the FRN is officially worthless .
This " kill " date must also be coordinated with legislation which dishonors the Treasury Bonds which foreign banks now own ( i.e. we must shut off both pumps at approximately the same time ) .
Clearly , if the Silver Bond solution is adopted , the maturity dates on these bonds also need to be carefully coordinated with the deadline for total withdrawal of the Federal Reserve Note .
FRN 's can be used to purchase Silver Bonds ; or FRN 's can be traded for U.S. Notes , " over the counter " and " one- for - one " at all participating banks ( read " all banks " by law ) .
To illustrate , the ramp - up in minting of silver coins should begin BEFORE the first Silver Bond matures , and enough silver dollars must be warehoused to cover all Silver Bonds which may get redeemed .
By law , I would require 100 % of all Silver Bonds to be redeemable , on demand , as proof of the good faith and credit of the United States ( federal government ) under this new program .
Now , assuming that the U.S. Treasury Dept. can develop bank and consumer regulations which smooth this important transition , what are the real political ramifications ?
The answer to that question falls squarely on the willingness of wealthy foreign banks to tolerate the huge amount of debt they must eat , as a result of implementing this solution .
Dr. Edwin Vieira has confronted this problem , in his essay " Return to Constitutional Money , " and concluded that these foreign banks should be given no choice in the matter : either eat the debt , or face criminal racketeering charges .
There are many educated Americans who fear that these foreign banks would choose instead to wage an overt war against America , rather than forego all this future revenue .
The federal government must face this possibility realistically , and treat any such threats as nothing less than an expression of treasonous intent to invade our shores .
A policy of peaceful transition must be clarified by the Congress , and our loyal military must be alerted to the probability of foreign invasion during this period of transition .
Indeed , the foreign invasion appears already to have begun , under auspices of U.N. command .
The United Nations is controlled by the very same foreign banks who now hold massive numbers of U.S. Treasury Bonds slated for dishonor .
I do n't want to get too " far out " with a discussion of probable future scenarios .
However , it is essential to understand that the foreign banks who presently hold Treasury Bonds , must face a future in which those Bonds are destroyed , because it is the new policy of the United States ( federal government ) to dishonor bonds which were acquired by means of fraud and racketeering by foreign banks , particularly if the real leverage of their " scheme " is in a ratio of $ 107.50 - to -$ 0.03 !
I assume you all have calculators to do your own computation of this ratio .

A Police Chief Incarcerated Prostitute Scandal Rattles Tehran Government
A sex scandal is causing trouble for President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's government in Tehran , in spite of numerous attempts to hush it up .
But is Reza Zarei , the police chief caught in a brothel with six prostitutes , still alive ?
The Saudi king rebuffed President Bush 's request for higher oil production , in the latest sign of how U.S. leaders are struggling to combat soaring energy costs that have become a major election - year issue .
The exchange between King Abdullah and Mr. Bush came on a day when crude - oil futures hit another record , up $ 2.17 per barrel to close at $ 126.29 on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
With U.S. voters seething over gas prices , Congress is considering a grab bag of ideas : Withholding arms sales to Saudi Arabia until it ramps up production by one million barrels per day ; opening up the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to anticollusion lawsuits in the U.S. ; and tightening regulation of oil trading .
The Saudis ' cool response Friday to the volley of American pleas and threats underscores that the U.S. , which relies on imports for about 60 % of its 20 - million - barrel - a - day oil habit , has no near - term prospect of managing prices down .
But even as the administration pressed its request for more Saudi supplies , U.S. officials conceded the current level of Saudi production is n't the prime factor driving today 's oil spike .
" There is something going on in this oil market that is more complicated than just turning on the spigot , " White House national security adviser Stephen Hadley told reporters , recounting the president 's afternoon meetings with Saudi officials at King Abdullah 's farm .
Saudi officials told American officials that they believe prices are soaring due to a host of factors that they and independent analysts have been citing for several years now .
Those include the falling value of the U.S. dollar ; increased speculation and hedging in financial markets ; geopolitical uncertainty in the Gulf region and other producing regions ; refining capacity that often is n't well - suited for current production ; and pessimism in some quarters about the long - term outlook for global oil supplies .

Thi Hue , who is blind , with her mother .
In the 1960s , the United States blanketed the Mekong River delta with Agent Orange , a chemical defoliant more devastating than napalm .
Thirty years after the end of the Vietnam War , the chemical is still poisoning the water and coursing through the blood of a third generation .
From Ho Chi Minh City to the town of Ben Tre — and from Greensboro , North Carolina , to Hackettstown , New Jersey — the photographer James Nachtwey went in search of the ecocide ’s cruelest legacy , horribly deformed children in both Vietnam and America .
Nachtwey , arguably the most celebrated war photographer of his generation , sees the former conflict in Southeast Asia as a touchstone for his work .
“ My decision to become a photographer , ” he says , “ was inspired by photographs from the Vietnam War . ”
This expanded photo essay from the land of Agent Orange — part of which appears in the August V.F. — makes clear , according to Nachtwey , that “ the effects of war no longer end when the shooting stops . ”

80 N.Y.2d 875 , 600 N.E.2d 232 , 587 N.Y.S.2d 601 ( 1992 ) .
July 7 , 1992
This memorandum is uncorrected and subject to revision before publication in the New York Reports .
Herald Price Fahringer , for Appellant Santorelli .
Donald W. O'Brien , Jr. , for Appellant Schloss .
Elizabeth Clifford , for Respondent .
MEMORANDUM :
The order of Monroe County Court should be reversed and the informations dismissed .
Defendants ' claim that Penal Law § 245.01 offends the equal protection clauses of the Federal and State Constitutions was expressly passed upon by County Court , and its disposition of that claim was a necessary basis for its order of reversal of the Rochester City Court which had dismissed the informations ( see , People v Craft , 149 Misc 2d 223 [ Monroe Co Ct ] ; People v Craft , 134 Misc 2d 121 [ Roch City Ct ] ) .
We , therefore , reject the People 's argument that under CPL 470.35 ( 2 ) ( a ) the Court of Appeals lacks jurisdiction to pass upon that claim .
Defendants were arrested for violating Penal Law § 245.01 ( exposure of a person ) when they bared " that portion of the breast which is below the top of the areola " in a Rochester public park .
The statute , they urge , is discriminatory on its face since it defines " private or intimate parts " of a woman 's but not a man 's body as including a specific part of the breast .
That assertion being made , it is settled that the People then have the burden of proving that there is an important government interest at stake and that the gender classification is substantially related to that interest ( see , Mississippi University for Women v Hogan , 458 US 718 , 725 ) .
In this case , however , the People have made no attempt below and make none before us to demonstrate that the statute 's discriminatory effect serves an important governmental interest or that the classification is based on a reasoned predicate .
Moreover , the People do not dispute that New York is one of only two states which criminalizes the mere exposure by a woman in a public place of a specific part of her breast .
Despite the People 's virtual default on the constitutional issue , we must construe a statute , which enjoys a presumption of constitutionality , to uphold its constitutionality if a rational basis can be found to do so ( see , McKinney 's Cons Laws of NY , Book 1 , Statutes , § 150 [ c ] ; People v Price , 33 NY2d 831 [ defendant 's equal protection claim not addressed because statute was construed to not apply ] ; Childs v Childs , 69 AD2d 406 , 418-421 ) .
Penal Law § 245.01 , when originally enacted ( L 1967 , c 367 , § 1 ) , " was aimed at discouraging ' topless ' waitresses and their promoters ( see , Practice Commentary by Denzer and McQuillan , McKinney 's Cons Laws of N.Y. , Book 39 , Penal Law , § 245.01 , p. 200 ) " ( People v Price , 33 NY2d 831 , 832 , supra ) .
Considering the statute 's provenance , we held in Price that a woman walking along a street wearing a fishnet , see - through pull - over blouse did not transgress the statute and that it " should not be applied to the noncommercial , perhaps accidental , and certainly not lewd , exposure alleged " ( id. at 832 ) .
Though the statute and the rationale for that decision are different , we believe that underlying principle of People v Price ( supra ) should be followed . [n
1 ] We , therefore , conclude that Penal Law § 245.01 is not applicable to the conduct presented in these circumstances and that the City Court was correct in dismissing the informations .
F O O T N O T E
1. Contrary to the position of the concurrence ( see concurring opn , at 4 ) , nothing in the Legislature 's repeal and replacement of former Penal Law § 245.01 ( L 1983 , ch 216 ) , subsequent to our decision in Price , affects the holding of Price or our analysis here .
The revised § 245.01 expanded the application of the former statute and prohibited full nudity by males and females ( see , People v Hollman , 68 NY2d 202 ) .
In its definition of " private or intimate parts " as including women 's breasts , however , the revised statute retained the same discriminatory infirmity which occasioned our decision in Price .
We find no basis in the revised statute or in the statutory history for not giving effect to Price here ( see , Bill Jacket , L 1983 , ch 216 , Governor 's Approval Memorandum ) .
Titone , J. ( concurring ) :
Citing the maxim that wherever possible statutes should be construed so as to sustain their constitutionality ( see , e.g. , Matter of Sarah K. , 66 NY2d 223 , cert denied sub nom .
Kosher v Stamatis , 475 US 1108 ; Loretto v Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp. , 58 NY2d 143 ) , the Court bypasses appellants ' equal protection argument by holding that Penal Law § 245.01 simply does not apply " in these circumstances . "
That maxim is unhelpful here , however , since both the language and the history of Penal Law § 245.01 demonstrate quite clearly that the conduct with which appellants were charged is precisely the type of behavior that the Legislature intended to outlaw when it enacted Penal Law § 245.01 .
Thus , appellants ' constitutional equal protection claim cannot be avoided and the only relevant legal maxim is the one that demands proof by the State that a classification based on gender be substantially related to the achievement of an important governmental objective ( e.g. , Caban v Mohammed , 441 US 380 , 388 , 393 ; People v Liberta , 64 NY2d 152 , 168 ) .
Since that standard has not been satisfied here , I would hold that , as applied in these circumstances , Penal Law § 245.01 is unconstitutional and , for that reason , the charges against appellants should have been dismissed .
Appellants and the five other women who were arrested with them were prosecuted for doing something that would have been permissible , or at least not punishable under the penal laws , if they had been men -- they removed their tops in a public park , exposing their breasts in a manner that all agree was neither lewd nor intended to annoy or harass .
As a result of this conduct , which was apparently part of an effort to dramatize their opposition to the law , appellants were prosecuted under Penal Law § 245.01 , which provides that a person is guilty of the petty offense of " exposure " when he or she " appears in a public place in such a manner that the private or intimate parts of his [ or her ] body are unclothed or exposed . "
The statute goes on to state that , for purposes of this prohibition , " the private or intimate parts of a female person shall include that portion of the breast which is below the top of the areola . " [ n
1 ]
The statute thus creates a clear gender - based classification , triggering scrutiny under equal protection principles ( see , Craig v Boren , 429 US 190 ) .
The majority has attempted to short - circuit this equal protection inquiry by holding that Penal Law § 245.01 is inapplicable to these facts .
However , apart from a cryptic reference to People v Price ( 33 NY2d 831 ) , which the majority admits involved a different statute and rationale , no explanation is offered as to why this facially applicable statute should not be applied here or what specific factor differentiates these circumstances from those in which the statute was intended to apply .
Price is inapt in this context because it involved the predecessor to the current Penal Law § 245.01 ( L 1967 , ch 367 , § 1 , amended L 1970 , ch 40 , § 1 , repealed L 1983 , ch 216 , § 1 ) , which was entitled " exposure of a female " and , as the majority acknowledges , " was aimed at discouraging ' topless ' waitresses and their promoters " ( People v Price , supra , at 832 ; see , Donnino , Practice Commentary , McKinney 's Consol Laws of NY , Book 39 , Penal Law § 245.01 , at 299-300 ) .
Given that purpose , it made sense for the Court to hold in Price that the statute " should not be applied to the noncommercial , perhaps accidental , and certainly not lewd , exposure alleged " in that case ( 33 NY2d , at 832 ) . [n 2 ]
In contrast , the current version of Penal Law § 245.01 , which was adopted in 1983 to replace the statute at issue in Price ( L 1983 , ch 216 , § 1 ) , was specifically intended to expand the reach of the " public exposure " prohibition .
The new provision was aimed at filling a gap resulting from the fact that the existing law prohibited women from appearing topless in public but contained no prohibition against either men or women appearing bottomless in public places ( Bill Jacket , L 1983 , ch 216 , Governor 's Approval Memorandum ) .
The explicit purpose of the new law was to protect parents and children who use the public beaches and parks " from the discomfort caused by unwelcome public nudity " ( id. ; accord , Bill Jacket , L 1983 , ch 216 , Sponsors ' Memorandum re A -5638 ; id. , Letter dated May 31 , 1983 from Assembly Member G.E. Lipshutz to Governor Cuomo re : A - 5638 ) .
Simply put , the focus of the legislation was to proscribe nude sunbathing by ordinary citizens ( see , People v Hollman , 68 NY2d 202 ) .
It thus cannot seriously be argued that the present version of Penal Law § 245.01 was intended to be limited , as its predecessor may have been , to commercially - motivated conduct .
Nor can it be argued that Penal Law § 245.01 was intended to be confined to conduct that is lewd or intentionally annoying .
First , there is absolutely no support in the legislative history for such a construction .
Second , a construction of Penal Law § 245.01 requiring lewdness would be of highly questionable validity , since it would render Penal Law § 245.00 [ prohibiting the exposure of " intimate parts " " in a lewd manner " ] redundant ( see , Statutes , McKinney 's Consol Laws of NY , Book 1 , § 98 [ " [ a ]ll parts of a statute must be harmonized * * * and effect and meaning must * * * be given to the entire statute " ) .
Finally , whatever the Court may have said about the limitations of the predecessor provision ( see , People v Price , supra ) , this Court has already applied the current version of Penal Law 245.01 to the public exposure of a person 's " intimate parts , " even where the conduct was merely an expression of a personal philosophy or a simple effort to " enhance * * * comfort [ or ] acquire an even tan " ( People v Hollman , supra , at 206 ) .
Our analysis in People v Hollman ( supra ) , thus plainly belies the limiting construction the majority now seems to adopt .
Accordingly , there is simply no sound basis for construing Penal Law § 245.01 so as to be inapplicable to the deliberate , nonaccidental conduct with which appellants were charged .
The Court 's reliance on the " presumption of constitutionality " in these circumstances is thus nothing more than an artful means of avoiding a confrontation with an important constitutional problem .
While it is true that statutes should be construed so as to avoid a finding of unconstitutionality if possible ( Statutes , supra , § 150 [ c ] , at 321 ) , courts should not reach for strained constructions or adopt constructions that are patently inconsistent with the legislation 's core purpose ( see , People v Dietze , 75 NY2d 47 , 52 - 53 ; cf. , People v Mancuso , 255 NY 463 , 474 ) .
In doing so here , the majority has gone well beyond the limits of statutory construction and has , in effect , rewritten a statute so that it no longer applies to precisely the conduct that the Legislature intended to outlaw .
The equal protection analysis that the majority has attempted to avoid is certainly not a complex or difficult one .
When a statute explicitly establishes a classification based on gender , as Penal Law § 245.01 unquestionably does , the State has the burden of showing that the classification is substantially related to the achievement of an important governmental objective ( e.g. , Caban v Mohammed , supra at 388 , supra ; Craig v Boren , supra , at 197 ; People v Liberta , supra , at 168 ) .
The analysis may have been made somewhat more difficult in this case because of the People 's failure to offer any rationale whatsoever for the gender - based distinction in Penal Law § 245.01 .
Nonetheless , in the absence of any discussion by the People , the objective to be achieved by the challenged classification can be readily identified .
It is clear from the statute 's legislative history , as well as our own case law and common sense , that the governmental objective to be served by Penal Law § 245.01 is to protect the sensibilities of those who wish to use the public beaches and parks in this State ( People v Hollman , supra , at 207 ; see , Bill Jacket , L 1983 , ch 216 , Governor 's Approval Memorandum , supra ; id. , Sponsor 's Memorandum , supra ; id. , Letter from Assembly Member G.E. Lipshutz to Governor Cuomo , supra ) .
And , since the statute prohibits the public exposure of female -- but not male - - breasts , it betrays an underlying legislative assumption that the sight of a female 's uncovered breast in a public place is offensive to the average person in a way that the sight of a male 's uncovered breast is not .
It is this assumption that lies at the root of the statute 's constitutional problem .
Although protecting public sensibilities is a generally legitimate goal for legislation ( see , e.g. , People v Hollman , supra ) , it is a tenuous basis for justifying a legislative classification that is based on gender , race or any other grouping that is associated with a history of social prejudice ( see , Mississippi Univ. for Women v Hogan , 458 US 718 , 725 [ " [ c ] are must be taken in ascertaining whether the statutory objective itself reflects archaic and stereotypic notions " ] ) .
Indeed , the concept of " public sensibility " itself , when used in these contexts , may be nothing more than a reflection of commonly - held preconceptions and biases .
One of the most important purposes to be served by the equal protection clause is to ensure that " public sensibilities " grounded in prejudice and unexamined stereotypes do not become enshrined as part of the official policy of government .
Thus , where " public sensibilities " constitute the justification for a gender - based classification , the fundamental question is whether the particular " sensibility " to be protected is , in fact , a reflection of archaic prejudice or a manifestation of a legitimate government objective ( cf. , People v Whidden , 51 NY2d 457 , 461 ) .
Viewed against these principles , the gender - based provisions of Penal Law § 245.01 cannot , on this record , withstand scrutiny .
Defendants contend that apart from entrenched cultural expectations , there is really no objective reason why the exposure of female breasts should be considered any more offensive than the exposure of the male counterparts .
They offered proof that , from an anatomical standpoint , the female breast is no more or less a sexual organ than is the male equivalent ( see , e.g. , J McCrary , Human Sexuality [ 1973 ] 141 ) .
They further contend that to the extent that many in our society may regard the uncovered female breast with a prurient interest that is not similarly aroused by the male equivalent ( but see Kinsey , Sexual Behavior in the Human Female [ 1953 ] 586-587 ; Kinsey , Sexual Behavior in Human Male [ 1948 ]
575 ; Wildman , Note on Males ' and Females ' Preference for Opposite - Sex Body Parts , 38 Psychological Reports 485-486 ) , that perception cannot serve as a justification for differential treatment because it is itself a suspect cultural artifact rooted in centuries of prejudice and bias toward women .
Indeed , there are many societies in other parts of the world -- and even many locales within the United States -- where the exposure of female breasts on beaches and in other recreational area is commonplace and is generally regarded as unremarkable . [n
3 ]
It is notable that , other jurisdictions have taken the position that breasts are not " private parts " and that breast exposure is not indecent behavior ( State v Parenteau , Ohio Misc 2d 10 , 11 , citing State v Jones , 7 NC App 165 ; State v Moore , 241 P2d 455 ; State v Crenshaw , 61 Haw 68 ; see also Duvallon v State , 404 So 2d 196 ) , and twenty - two states specifically confine their statutory public exposure prohibitions to uncovered genitalia . [n 4 ]
The People in this case have not refuted this evidence or attempted to show the existence of evidence of their own to indicate that the non-lewd exposure of the female breast is in any way harmful to the public 's health or well being .
Nor have they offered any explanation as to why , the fundamental goal that Penal Law § 245.01 was enacted to advance -- avoiding offense to citizens who use public beaches and parks -- cannot be equally well served by other alternatives ( see , Wengler v Druggists Mut.
Ins. Co. , 446 US 142 , 151-152 ; Orr v Orr , 440 US 268 , 281-283 ) .
In summary , the People have offered nothing to justify a law that discriminates against women by prohibiting them from removing their tops and exposing their bare chests in public as men are routinely permitted to do .
The mere fact that the statute 's aim is the protection of " public sensibilities " is not sufficient to satisfy the state 's burden of showing an " exceedingly persuasive justification " for a classification that expressly discriminates on the basis of sex ( see , Kirchberg v Feenstra , 450 US 455 , 461 ) .
Accordingly , the gender - based classification established by Penal Law § 245.01 violates appellants ' equal protection rights and , for that reason , I concur in the majority 's result and vote to reverse the order below .
F O O T N O T E S
1. Public exposure of a female 's breast for the purposes of breastfeeding infants or " entertaining or performing in a play , exhibition , show or entertainment " is expressly excluded from the statutory prohibition .
2. Significantly , the allegation in Price was that the defendant had been observed on a public street wearing a fishnet pullover which left portions of her breasts visible , prompting the Court to observe that , absent certain conditions , " legislation may not control the manner of dress " ( 33 NY2d , at 832 ) .
That consideration is obviously not relevant here , where appellants ' conduct was obviously intended as a political , rather than a fashion , statement .
3 . Interestingly , expert testimony at appellants ' trial suggested that the enforced concealment of women 's breasts reinforces cultural obsession with them , contributes toward unhealthy attitudes about breasts by both sexes and even discourages women from breastfeeding their children .

This 13 watt bulb , the Evolux by EarthLED , is said to be first LED light to be able to replace a 100 watt incandescent .
The lifetime of this bulb is rated at over 50,000 hours — which is five times longer than a compact fluorescent bulb .
Other advantages of LED bulbs is their ability to brighten instantly , and be switched off and on rapidly without problems .
They also contain no mercury .
LED - based bulbs do , however , require more energy to manufacture that CFL or incandescents .
The Evolux uses a CREE light engine , and it contains a small fan to cool the circuit board .
EarthLED has a video of the bulb in action , and also some photos showing the type of the light it renders .
The Evolux bulb sells about $ 90 right now .
If you are serious about energy efficiency , or if you ’re using solar power , this might be the bulb for you .
It ’s available from GoGreenSolar for about $ 80 .
See also the $ 60 GEOBulb , which is another LED light bulb .
In 1999 , the South African - born Mark Shuttleworth sold his internet company , Thawte , which provided digital certificates for websites , for more than $ 500 m ( £ 254 m ) .
After spending $ 20 m on a trip into space , he started the Ubuntu project - named after an African word meaning " Humanity to others " , or " I am what I am because of who we all are " - which has since become the most popular GNU / Linux distribution .
Technology Guardian :
To what extent did your space trip feed into Ubuntu ?
Mark Shuttleworth
Going to space and seeing the Earth from a distance makes it very clear just how interdependent we are .
So I wanted to do something that was really global ; free software is a phenomenon that is truly global .
TG : What are the implications of choosing that name ?
MS
That this is a platform for people .
Linux has come from a tradition of being a platform for specialists .
We articulated the challenge for us very clearly in our name : " Let 's make this something that we can proudly give out to people who are not passionate about technology . "
TG : How does your company , Canonical , fit into this ?
MS [ Ubuntu ] has its own release cycle .
It has its own governance structures .
Canonical plays a significant role in those , and we are the largest underwriter of all the work that gets done .
We make sure that it releases on time ; that it 's available globally ; that it meets criteria ; that it works across a certain portfolio of hardware that third parties have asked us to certify .
But we do n't take credit for all of the smart thinking that happens in Ubuntu .
In fact , in almost every release there 's been an idea that came from volunteer participants that turned into a profoundly important feature in that release .
TG : I gather that you had a rather unusual way of picking the people you originally employed at Canonical .
MS I simply read a large amount of correspondence between the developers on one of the projects that is key to the way we do Ubuntu , the Debian project .
It 's amazing how much jumps out in terms of the way people think , the depth of their experience .
So open source is not only a great way to develop your own talent and skills , but it's also a great way to get a job , and a great way to go looking for people .
TG : What 's the business model for Canonical ?
MS Our business model is entirely based on services around our software .
Because Canonical plays such a key role in Ubuntu , even though it does n't monopolise access to it , we 're a preferred partner for Ubuntu .
Whether it 's technical support , which we think people are more likely to buy from us than from anybody else , or whether it 's engineering , customisation , or the enablement of the platform on particular hardware , Canonical has a privileged position .
TG : How close are you to breaking even ?
MS Not close .
It will require time and ongoing investment .
We 've positioned ourselves for what we see as the future of software - unlicensed software , people having access to the software that they want at the time that they want it .
The service ecosystem around that software will fund it .
And if we are the company that has best anticipated that future , then we will be best positioned to benefit from it .
TG : How did the deal to put Ubuntu on Dell PCs come about ?
MS
We found out about it after it was a fait accompli .
[ Dell are ] very much a numbers - driven company .
They asked their users what they wanted to see .
They had a lot of data and that data pointed to us .
That was a little unsettling , because we did n't have a relationship .
But it was a significant step up in our corporate profile .
It will be very interesting to see what we 're able to do with companies like Dell , which are aimed at a wider audience .
That 's my number one challenge : how to make the Linux desktop something that you want to keep on your computer .
TG : Will you be coming out with a tailored version of Ubuntu for the ultraportable sector ?
MS
We 're announcing it in the first week of June .
It 's called the Netbook Remix .
We 're working with Intel , which produces chips custom - made for this sector .
TG : Do you think that GNU / Linux will ever become a significant force on the desktop ?
MS I think that depends on how people define a desktop .
If people continue to define a desktop as the thing that they run Microsoft Word on , then Windows will retain its position .
My sense , though , is that people are increasingly defining the desktop as the thing that they get access to the internet from .
In that case , there 's a real possibility that we 're able to shift people onto different platforms .
I think it 's the emergence of the internet as the killer application , the thing that describes what you want from the computer , that opens the door to us .
TG : Recently you publicly criticised the ISO for the way the way it handled the voting on Microsoft 's OOXML ; how seriously do you think ISO 's credibility has been damaged by that episode ?
MS Very seriously [ for ] anybody who is passionate about open standards .
The ISO process has traditionally worked very well ; it 's quite an academic , considered process , but it really was n't designed to handle a case with very , very vigorous corporate lobbying and an enormous amount of money being spent to try to get a particular outcome .
And with hindsight , there were a number of very serious flaws in the process .
TG : As Ubuntu gains in importance , do you feel that you have an increased responsibility to speak out in this way ?
MS I think we all have a responsibility to contribute to the public discourse .
I have a level of economic independence , which is perhaps a good and a bad thing , but at the very least my opinion can't be bought that easily .

THE office computer of suspended Power Authority Inspector General Daniel Wiese was “ wiped totally clean ” of e-mails and other records just days before being seized by investigators probing an alleged State Police dirty - tricks squad , The Post has learned .
The computer , believed to contain sensitive details of Wiese ’s communications with State Police officials , was grabbed last month at the Power Authority ’s headquarters in White Plains under a subpoena issued by the office of Attorney General Andrew Cuomo , a source close to the authority said .
“ The hard drive had been wiped totally clean just a day or two before investigators got to it , ” the source said .
“ Given the way it was scrubbed , it does not appear that the attorney general ’s investigators can recover the information that was there . ”
Investigators also found Wiese ’s computer had been equipped with a rare and sophisticated “ destroyer program ” that automatically wiped out files and e-mails stored for more than 60 days .
The use of a destroyer program may have violated a state law requiring the retention of official records , a second authority source said .
Wiese , a former State Police colonel and longtime associate of former Govs. George Pataki and Eliot Spitzer , was the power behind State Police operations in New York City , Westchester and Long Island for more than a decade .
He was linked last summer to the Dirty Tricks Scandal involving Spitzer ’s efforts to gather purportedly damaging information on Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno ( R - Rensselaer ) , and was accused by former Rep. John Sweeney ( R - Saratoga ) , a Pataki political rival , of involvement in the leak of an embarrassing State Police report on a domestic dispute that may have cost him re-election in 2006 .
Gov. Paterson , who directed Cuomo to conduct a criminal probe of the State Police five weeks ago , said Friday that fears that a renegade State Police unit was circulating damaging information on him led him to disclose past marital infidelities and youthful drug use just after taking office in March .
Cuomo ’s office refused to comment on the status of Wiese ’s computer .
Wiese , who was suspended with pay early last month , could not be reached for comment .
The Post disclosed last week that Cuomo ’s subpoena - armed investigators had seized the office computer of Laura Demichele , a Power Authority travel officer and longtime Wiese friend .
Two weeks ago , The Post disclosed that Cuomo was probing allegations that Wiese used a Power Authority security contract to dig up dirt on Spitzer ’s and Pataki ’s political foes .

Bilbo has been credited with helping swimmers Bilbo , Britain 's only lifeguard dog , who patrols Sennen in west Cornwall will no longer be seen on duty .
The RNLI has taken over beach safety at Sennen from Penwith District Council this year .
And it says the 14 - stone Newfoundland will be unable to patrol as a lifeguard because of a dog ban on the beach .
Bilbo's owner said the decision to keep a lifesaving asset off the beach was a " scandal " , but Penwith council is backing the RNLI .
He is the biggest asset for beach safety and for the RNLI to disown him is a scandal
Steve " Jamo " Jamieson Bilbo has been part of the lifeguard team at Sennen for the past three years and has been praised for helping to prevent a swimmer getting into difficulties .
But his owner , Steve " Jamo " Jamieson , 53 , has been told by the RNLI that a concession which got Bilbo round a beach ban , was no longer acceptable for safety reasons .
Bilbo had been allowed to carry out his life guarding duties in the past because he had been carried on an all terrain bike ( ATB ) when he was not at the lifeguard hut or in the sea .
Now that the RNLI has taken over life guarding duties , it is not allowing him on their ATBs .
Rebecca Kirk , chief environmental officer at the council , told BBC News : " If he is on the beach it is against the law .
" It puts us in a really difficult position , but we have to be consistent . "
Bilbo has been carried on ATBs to get round the ban in the past Bilbo is not classed as a working dog , so if he goes on the beach , owner Jamo faces a £ 75 fine .
Jamo said : " I was dumbstruck when I was told .
" He is the biggest asset for beach safety and for the RNLI to disown him is a scandal . "
Steve Instance , the RNLI 's lifeguard inspector the South West said : " We have been as flexible as possible .
" But ATBs are for one person only and if a dog is 14 stone he is a passenger and that is simply not safe .
" We are not simply sticking to the rules for the sake of it .
There are a lot of accidents on ATBs . "
He added : " Bilbo is a fantastic asset and we have told Jamo he can use him for PR work and safety education in schools .
" But it is not suitable for the RNLI to have him as an operational lifeguard .

The Python Make tool
A while back there was a lot of talk about needing a Make tool for Python , one like Ruby Rake .
There are a few packages now :
SCONS A software construction tool
zc.buildout System for managing development buildouts
... and more recently :
Vellum Vellum is Zed Shaw 's project to create a nice build tool for Python , or really for anything you need to automate in a consistent fashion .
Paver Paver is a Python - based build / distribution / deployment scripting tool along the lines of Make or Rake
Personally , I liked Ian Bicking 's suggestion to just use distutils but apparently his examples came off convoluted .
I think this is because distutils is somewhat convoluted ( to be fair , it was created a long time ago in software years ) .
At the time of that article I took Ian 's advice and tried to do Make - like work in distutils commands .
It was a pain .
Mostly , I kept forgetting how everything needed to be set up .
Since distutils silently ignores errors it does n't tell you what 's wrong , your command just does n't work .
But I still think the core concept is a good one .
You probably already have a setup.py file anyway , so why not add some commands to it ?
disthelper
So ... I made a helper to reduce the pain of creating setup.py commands : disthelper
It 's the simplest possible approach : it just automates the creation of standard setup.py commands .
You need setuptools and Paste to run disthelper but you do n't need anything beyond the stdlib distutils module to run your custom command .
I think more pain can be abstracted out of creating distutils commands .
First off , I 've been experimenting with an optparse - based wrapper around distutils .core .
Command .
This is n't ready for release but so far I am convinced it is possible to make a nicer Command class that 's fully backwards compatible with distutils .
core .
Command .
This could be taken even further and grow a decorator interface or something simpler that did n't require a class ( for simple commands ) .
If anyone wants to help dream up an interface , I 've laid down the ground work to make this distutils - compatible and am willing to help implement it ( my time permitting , of course ) .
As an aside , I think such a wrapper would make a nice addition to the stdlib as long as backwards - compatibility is maintained .
Somewhat related is the buildutils project .
Buildutils defines many custom tasks you typically want to perform on your project .
At some point I may also make disthelper a repository for typical commands but right now I 'd like to focus on making it a facilitator of creating setup.py commands .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Supreme Court this week hears arguments about whether the death penalty can be imposed for child rape , taking up for the first time in more than 30 years whether a crime other than murder can be punished by execution .
The nation ’s highest court has set arguments on Wednesday on whether the death penalty for the crime of raping a child represents unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment .
It will be the second major death penalty case heard this year .
In January , the justices considered the current lethal three - drug cocktail used in most U.S. executions .
A ruling is expected by late June on the challenge by two Kentucky death row inmates who argued the lethal injection method violated the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment by inflicting needless pain and suffering .
Executions in the United States last year fell to a 13 - year low of 42 , and have been temporarily halted since the Supreme Court agreed in late September to decide the lethal injection case .
The Supreme Court ’s review of death penalty - related cases comes amid a growing nationwide debate on capital punishment itself in one of the few democracies that still permit it .
The case involved an appeal by Patrick Kennedy of Louisiana , who was convicted of raping his 8 - year - old stepdaughter and sentenced to death .
Of the more than 3,300 inmates on death row in America , Kennedy and another man convicted of child rape in Louisiana are the only two who did not commit murder .
The last execution in the United States for rape occurred 44 years ago .
AGE AT ISSUE
In 1977 , the Supreme Court banned executions for rape in a case in which the victim was an adult woman but left open whether child rapists can be sentenced to death .
The Louisiana law was adopted in 1995 .
In its current version , rape can be punished by death when the victim was under 13 years of age .
At least four other states -- Montana , Oklahoma , South Carolina and Texas -- have similar laws .
Jeffrey Fisher , a Stanford University law professor representing Kennedy , argued that the U.S. Constitution bars imposing the death penalty for rape , regardless of the victim ’s age .
“ Society views capital punishment as excessive punishment for child rape , ” Fisher said , citing a national consensus and international norms .
“ Today no Western nation authorizes the death penalty for any kind of rape , ” Fisher said , adding that it is allowed in only a handful of countries , including China , Egypt , Jordan , Nigeria and Saudi Arabia .
Juliet Clark , an assistant district attorney in Louisiana , said the death penalty represented a constitutional punishment for raping a child .
“ Public outrage over the sexual violation of immature young children by predatory adults is extremely great due to the recognition that these offenders target and harm the most vulnerable members of our society , ” she said .
She said 14 states and the federal government authorize the death penalty for various offenses other than murder , such as treason , espionage , kidnapping and aircraft hijacking .
Nine states , led by Texas , supported Louisiana , while the American Civil Liberties Union and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund supported Kennedy .
The two rights groups said a historical consensus existed against the death penalty for rape in the United States , except for Southern states willing in the past to execute blacks , especially those convicted of raping white women and children .
Paul Butler , a law professor at George Washington University , said moderate conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy may hold the decisive vote on the court closely divided between conservatives and liberals .
Kennedy wrote the court ’s majority opinion in 2005 that abolished the death penalty for juveniles and he joined the majority opinion in 2002 that barred executions of mentally retarded criminals .
BEIJING , China ( CNN ) -- China 's Health Ministry strengthened surveillance and dispatched specialists to the eastern Anhui province as the death toll from a virulent virus climbed to 22 , the Xinhua News Agency reported .
A girl suffering from an Enterovirus 71 infection receives treatment this week in a Fuyang , China , hospital .
The number of reported cases of the virus in children rose to 3,736 early Saturday in the hardest - hit city of Fuyang , according to the state - run news agency .
There were 3,321 reported cases Friday in Fuyang .
Xinhua reported that 4,529 children have been sickened in 15 cities in Anhui province .
The virus -- called Enterovirus 71 , or EV71 -- can cause hand , foot and mouth disease .
It 's often confused with foot - and - mouth disease in livestock , but the diseases are n't the same , according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
An Anhui province official , Wang Yan , told Xinhua that 978 children are hospitalized , including 48 in critical condition .
" Authorities in Anhui ... are doing the utmost to treat the children and strengthen disease control , " he said .
The virus is another concern for Chinese officials as the nation prepares to host the Summer Olympics , which open August 8 in Beijing .
Anhui province is south of the Chinese capital .
The Health Ministry issued a pamphlet Saturday urging local health bureaus to step up prevention and control of infectious diseases as the Olympics approach , Xinhua reported .
In milder cases , EV71 can cause coldlike symptoms , diarrhea and sores on the hands , feet and mouth , according to the journal Genetic Vaccines and Therapy .
But more severe cases can cause fluid to accumulate on the brain , resulting in polio - like paralysis and death , according to the journal .
There is no effective antiviral treatment for severe EV71 infections , and no vaccine is available .
Adults ' well - developed immune systems usually can fend off the virus , but children are vulnerable to it , according to the CDC .
There was a large outbreak of the virus in Taiwan in 1998 with 78 deaths , and smaller outbreaks recurred in 2000 and 2001 , the CDC said .
Wang Jinshan , secretary of the Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China , visited hospitals in Fuyang on Friday and called for a long - term system to prevent such outbreaks , Xinhua said .
In addition , 45 medical specialists have arrived in the city .
Anhui has upgraded its public health emergency status from Class 3 to Class 2 , meaning the provincial government can quarantine patients and control movement in to and out of Fuyang .
In a statement Friday , the World Health Organization noted that the number of hospitalized cases has gradually risen since late March , with a sharp increase in the number of cases since April 19 .
Public health officials expect the number of cases to peak in June or July , the WHO said .
" Chinese health authorities have put in place targeted prevention and control measures in Fuyang city and Anhui province , including enhanced surveillance , training of health care workers at all levels in treatment , prevention and control , strengthening of environmental health management and the supervision and monitoring of drinking water quality , " the WHO statement said .
" A public awareness campaign is ongoing , stressing the need for good personal hygiene , mostly by hand washing . "

Video : Waxman tells Republican lawmaker , ' I 'll have you physically removed from this meeting '

Print This Email This House Oversight Committee chair grows frustrated with evasiveness of EPA Administrator at hearing
The head of the Environmental Protection Agency came under sharp attack at a House hearing Tuesday , with Democratic lawmakers accusing him of repeatedly caving in to White House pressure on environmental issues such as global warming and a recently enacted health standard for smog .
EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson rejected the characterization and said that while he frequently discusses EPA matters with the White House , the decisions are his .
But Johnson , appearing before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee for nearly three hours , repeatedly refused to discuss conversations he had with the White House , nor provide a number of documents that have been subpoenaed by the committee concerning the smog standard and his refusal to allow California to proceed with rules to cut greenhouse gases .
Rep. Henry Waxman , D - Calif. , the committee chairman , said depositions provided by senior EPA staff members suggest that Johnson had been overruled or heavily influenced by the White House on recent EPA decisions on the smog standard , its rejected of a waiver for California on global warming regulations , and the EPA ongoing deliberations on whether to regulate carbon dioxide .
" You have essentially become a figurehead , " Waxman told Johnson . " ...
In each case , you backed down . "
He said in each of the EPA cases " the pattern is the same .
The president apparently insisted in his judgment and overrode the unanimous recommendations of EPA scientific and legal experts , " said Waxman .
" You reversed yourself after having candid conversations with the White House . "
Johnson , a 27 - year career EPA scientist himself before being elevated to head the agency , repeatedly insisted that he was the final decision maker on the issues cited by Waxman , although acknowledging frequent discussions with the White House on those and other matters .
But Waxman 's committee can only guess on the details of those conversations and communications .
Johnson declined repeated requests by Democrats on the panel to provide any details about conversations he had with the White House , refusing at one point to even acknowledge whether he did or did not discuss the smog , California waiver or carbon dioxide rulemaking with the president .
Waxman , growing frustrated , said to Johnson , " It seems to me you 're being awfully evasive and I do n't know why you cannot tell this committee whether you in fact had a discussion about this rule , or that rule , or the other rule . "
Shortly after , Republican lawmaker Darrell Issa of California attempted to intervene , but Waxman waved him off .
Issa continued to call for point of order until Waxman angrily pounded his gavel and said to him , " I will have you physically removed from this meeting if you do n't stop . "
Waxman then again pressed Johnson , who finally answered , " I do n't believe that it is appropriate for me to get into the details of what those conversations are or are not . "

With wire services .
One million Democrats attempting to vote in this year ’s primaries found their names missing from voter rolls .
WHERE THE HELL DID THEY GO ?
Law professor Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and journalist Greg Palast are launching an investigation .
We want to know : where are these votes ?
Who swiped them ?
How ?
And how do we prevent it from happening in November ?
The investigations team needs your help .
RIGHT NOW .
The not - for - profit Investigative Fund needs support to pay the cost of phones , airfare , microphones ( hidden , when needed ) , detective agency fees , camera crew , researchers and all the infrastructure of inquest .
We need , right now , two dozen Producers to put up at least $ 1000 each to pay for the preliminary investigation and production .
You ’ll get a tax deduction , a box loaded with DVDs of the finished films now planned from broadcast internationally – and maybe , just maybe , an honest election .
Because it ’s our plan to put out the information on the manipulation of the vote BEFORE November .
Ca n’t put up $ 1,000 ?
Then donate $ 500 and get a package of all of my books and DVDs signed to you .
Even a $ 100 gift will be put to good use – and we ’ll send you my three latest DVD films , including “ The Elections Files ” ( Watch the trailer ) from our BBC TV investigations .
Bobby Kennedy , in his masterful article in Rolling Stone , exposed how Ohio votes vanished in 2004 .
The Palast team , for BBC Television , unmasked the vicious scrub of Black voters in Florida in 2000 .
Now Kennedy and Palast have joined together with an extraordinary team of investigators to hunt the missing votes of 2008 BEFORE we have a repeat of 2000 and 2004 .
I have n’t sought funding from you all this year – but now I must .
Neither I nor RFK take a dime of compensation from the Palast Investigative Fund .
But the fund ’s hit empty and we ca n’t ask a our brilliant crew to continue to survive on dog food – they ’re beginning to bark at embarrassing moments !
Become a Producer and get personalized signed copies of the books RFK calls , “ investigative masterpieces , ” my books , The Best Democracy Money Can Buy and Armed Madhouse .
Or donate AT LEAST $ 100 – try to make it more – and get Armed Madhouse ( hardbound ) and the CD , “ Live from the Armed Madhouse , ” signed .
Our investigation is non-partisan .
It ’s not about saving Democrats , but saving DEMOCRACY .
But we know who 's playing games with the ballots .
FACT : On Super - Tuesday , the number of Democrats missing from voter rolls in New Mexico exceeded George Bush ’s 2004 victory total by 300 % .
No wonder McCain ’s campaign says , New Mexico is “ in play . ”
The question is who ’s playing with it ?
Join our effort .
If you ’ve got a tip , a document , a witness – CONTACT US .
And add your name to the list of Producers and Supporters .

Secrets of Scientology : Travolta and the E - Meter
Alt.religion.scientology
Week in Review Volume 2 , Issue 2 4/20/97 by Rod Keller [ rkeller@voicenet.com ] copyright 1997 [ snip ] > Travolta Meter
The Star tabloid published an article this week on Scientology celebrities and the e-meter .
" The oddball apparatus is called an E meter , and Travolta uses it every day .
He and fellow Scientologists Tom Cruise , Nicole Kidman , and Kirstie Alley say the lie - detector - like machine measures mental anguish .
The faithful claim it 's so sensitive , it can pick up the pain a human feels when pricked by a nail .
" ' You hold two metal rods in your hands , and an experienced teacher can tell from the movements of the needles on the meter where the problem is in your body and soul , ' Travolta told the German magazine STERN .
' I use it every day , at home or in the celebrity center in Hollywood .
I also take a machine with me with I 'm on location .
It 's a religious device and I enjoy it .
I 'm always totally refreshed by it . '
" Travolta vehemently denies claims that Scientologists have been brainwashed .
' That is frightful garbage , ' he says .
' Do you really believe that I would stand for something like that ?
The courses help me solve my problems .
I also attend religious counseling where , with a spiritual guide , I tackle personal problems . ' "

Law Prof Paul Caron has examined the tax returns released by Barack Obama today for the years 2000 to 2006 .
You can read the returns over at his blog .
What is surprising , given the recent controversy over Obama 's membership in the Trinity United Church of Christ , is how little the Obamas apparently gave to charity -- well short of the biblical 10 % tithe for all seven years .
In two of the years , the Obamas gave far less than 1 % of their income to charity ; in three of the years , they gave around 1 % of their income to charity .
Only in the last two years have they given substantially more as their income skyrocketed -- 4.7 % in 2005 and 6.1 % in 2006 .
( Of course , it is possible that the Obamas may have made gifts to other worthy causes that were not deductible for federal income tax purposes . )

Several months ago , we implemented ReCAPTCHA on MetaFilter contact forms , to thwart spammers .
It ’s a good cause and a great idea : the nonsensical text you decode ends up helping public domain book scanning projects .
But lately , we ’ve been getting a steady stream of complaints that it is not working or is unsolvable .
Last night I tried out the contact form and was surprised that in the first ten images presented to me ( keep hitting the little refresh button , the top of the three buttons on the control ) , at least half were totally undecipherable .
Here ’s an actual screenshot of one I saw this morning .
The first word is impossible to decipher .
My question is , has ReCAPTCHA had such success that all we ’re left with is the really , really bad book scans ?
Fox commentator : Ron Paul revolt could be ' disaster ' for Republicans David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday May 13 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Rep. Ron Paul is still in the GOP race and even drew 16 % of the vote in the recent Pennsylvania Republican primary .
Now his supporters are planning to stage a " revolt " at the Republican National Convention in September , possibly with the aim of securing Paul a prime time speaking slot .
Conservative radio talk show host Mike Gallagher told the hosts of Fox and Friends on Tuesday , " There is no question that this could be a major headache for John McCain . "
" John McCain would be well - served to kind of reach out and give him an olive branch at the convention , " Gallagher continued .
" Let him speak , give him a role , because if these people are disrespected -- you know , this , combined with Bob Barr 's announcement that Barr now is running as a Libertarian , is going to just take votes away from John McCain and could be a disaster for the Republican Party . "
Bob Barr recently cited Paul 's success as having helped inspire his own candidacy , pointing to " what Ron Paul has tapped into in terms of reaching an awful lot of young people in particular and illustrating very clearly that in this day and age it is possible to reach a lot of young people through the Internet . "
Democratic political consultant and commentator Bob Beckel then joined into the Fox discussion , saying of Paul , " I think he ought to get a prime time speech at the convention .
This is the only guy that has a bobble doll made for him that his head does n't move . "
" They 're nuts , " Beckel said of Paul 's supporters , hastening to add , " I do n't mean nuts in a bad way .
They 're nuts about their guy . "
" I think they ought to do it , Mike , " Beckel concluded , laughing .
" I think it would be great for you guys to have Ron Paul at your convention . "
" It'll show some diversity at the convention , " Gallagher acknowledged .
" That 's the kind of diversity you need , brother , " Beckel affirmed .

The EU 's accounts have failed to receive a clean bill of health
A report by the European Court of Auditors ( ECA ) criticises nearly every major area of the EU 's expenditure .
The auditors say there are weaknesses across the board and complain of neglect and presumed attempts at fraud .
The European Commission has blamed member states for audit failings , and says it has suspended £ 1.2bn in payments to English regions .
Errors persist
Errors of legality and regularity still persist in the majority of the EU 's 106bn euro annual budget ( £ 75 bn ) , according to the Court of Auditors .
Its President , Hubert Weber , calls on the commission to lead by example in making improvements .
HEAD TO HEAD
The auditors have concluded every year since 1994 that the accounts are reliable
Terry Wynn , ex-head of European Parliament budget committee
There has been a lot of window - dressing but essentially the auditors ' criticism has not changed
Marta Andreasen , former Commission chief accountant
Are the EU books a scandal ?
Euroblog : Extra Virgin con ?
The report explains that much of the misspending is caused by poor knowledge of complex rules but presumes that fraud also exists .
On the plus side , the auditors say that there has been a marked reduction in the estimated overall level of error in the Common Agricultural Policy ( CAP ) , responsible for some 40 % of all EU expenditure .
The commission is responsible for overseeing the handling of the budget and the auditors praise the " considerable efforts " made to address the weaknesses in its management of risk to EU funding .
Payments to UK
But the second biggest slice of the budget - regional development funding ( 32.4bn euros in 2006 ) - is said to have seen little improvement .
The Court estimates that at least 12 % of the total paid out was affected by errors , and complains of poor control by member states .

The commission says it suspended 1.7bn euros ( £ 1.2 bn ) in structural payments to the UK in April 2007 although that figure has now fallen to 326 m euros ( £ 229 m ) .
In response to the report , the Vice - President of the European Commission , Siim Kallas , says he 's " glad to see the Court now gives its green light to over 40 % of total payments " .
He points out that around a third of the budget was approved last year and only 6 % three years ago .
Interpreting figures
Marta Andreasen , a former European Commission chief accountant who now works for the United Kingdom Independence Party , says 80 % of the budget is still suspect .
AUDIT FINDINGS
The IACS system , which covers 70 % of agriculture spending , " is effective at limiting the risk of irregular expenditure "
At least 12 % of regional development aid was affected by errors , including money paid out to ineligible claimants Significant errors were found in internal spending , mainly due to claimants inflating costs
Mr Weber describes Ms Andreasen 's analysis as " the more orthodox approach " , but says Mr Kallas 's statement that 40 % of payments get the thumbs up is also valid .
The BBC's Jonny Dymond in Brussels says it is clear is that huge strides have been made in controlling the way that money is spent by the EU .
" There is now a determination , bordering on desperation , in some quarters , to show that the commission is not handing out cash willy - nilly to greedy famers and the like , " he says .
He adds that commission officials complain that there is little they can do when money is disbursed by the governments of member states , as 80 % of it is .
Dean Kamen showed some video of the impressive , mind - controlled prosthetic robot arm he ’s invented today at D6 in Carlsbad .
Kamen has been showing the arm off since early 2007 , usually via video clips like what he showed today .
But today ’s demonstration at D6 was impressive enough that it ’s got the gadget blogs and the Twitterverse all aflutter today .
Deservedly so : Kamen ’s arm , dubbed " Luke " ( after Skywalker , I assume ) , is an incredibly sophisticated bit of engineering that ’s lightyears ahead of the clamping " claws " that many amputees are forced to use today .
The arm is fully articulated , giving the user the same degrees of movement as a natural arm , and is sensitive enough to pick up a piece of paper , a wineglass or even a grape without mishap .
D6 posted the video above , which contains highlights from Kamen ’s remarks and demonstrations of the arm itself .

Ladies and Gentleman ,
This is a call to action .
The South needs our Help .
See this :
Whilst we ’re waiting for George ’s Promised Prayers to roll in , down here in the Tornado - Stricken Mid-South , I might recommend some DIRECT HUMAN INTERACTION .
This Is My Best First Start To Help My Region .
As Scout Prime is to NOLA , I am , suddenly , to the Mid-South area ( I LIVE here , and was Live - Blogging these horrible storms all night ) , and have started to get the help - ball rolling down here .
Some of you know where I work .
I started a Food Drive there today for the Mid-South United Way Food Bank .
As the area affected is so broad and detached , and everyone in the Country was distracted by politics last night , as yet , there is no central assistance hub set - up .
So , at the link , above , you ’ll find the two agencies with the broadest radius to help the area right now .
Both take DIRECT donations .
A small - blog swarm on that post ( or this comment ) would be greatly appreciated by more people than just me .
I ca n’t describe how wide - spread the damage is down here .
It ’s enormous .
The Media , per usual , is only just now waking up to the situation , after their Super - Duper - Let ’s - All - Wet - Our - Pants - Together - Tuesday Political Hangover .
Like NOLA , these are REALLY poor folks down here , and have nothing , and nowhere to go .
A short post about this at YOUR Blog , linking either to my post , above , or directly to the two Orgs mentioned in the post above , would sure be a big help , and would be greatly appreciated by many people who are relying on help .
They are all that we have right now .
I just donated a deer ’s worth of ground venison , along with the 100 pounds of rice and quart - sized ziplock bags that they said that they needed at the United Way Mid-South Food Bank , when I phoned them this morning .
Their pantry is BARE , and I ’ll be loading them up with all the potatoes , rice , veggies , bags , and other staples that I can fit in my truck tomorrow .
This is serious Red State country , and a flood of help from the DFH Left would REALLY make a big difference in a number of good ways .
I thank you all in advance .

If you 're using a consumer grade point - and - shoot Canon digital camera , you 've got hardware in hand that can support advanced features way beyond what shipped in the box .
With the help of a free , open source project called CHDK , you can get features like RAW shooting mode , live RGB histograms , motion - detection , time - lapse , and even games on your existing camera .
Let 's transform your point - and - shoot into a super camera just by adding a little special sauce to its firmware .

UPDATE : This guide is now out of date .
You can check out the new version of this guide here .

What is CHDK ?
The Canon Hacker 's Development Kit , aka CHDK , is a firmware enhancement that supports an impressive array of Canon digital cameras .
I emphasize the enhancement aspect of CHDK because the tool is non-permanent and non-destructive , meaning that you load it onto your camera whenever you want to use it ; CHDK makes no changes to your camera , and turning it off is simply a matter of restarting your camera .
Installing CHDK involves copying a couple of files onto your camera 's memory card ; permanently removing it from your camera entails deleting those files .
It 's simple and powerful ( sort of like hacking your router firmware ) but even easier .

What Can CHDK Do For Me ?
Now that you 're convinced that CHDK is easy to install and use , let 's consider what makes it worth doing so .
From the CHDK wiki : ( Pictures below of CHDK in action also from the CHDK wiki , since I have only one camera and it's the one running CHDK . )
Advertisement
Enhanced Image Capture : CHDK supports RAW format for pictures ( in addition to JPEG ) , longer recording time and length for videos ( up to 1 hour or 2GBs ) , and several new compression options .
Advertisement
Additional Information On - Screen : With CHDK , you can customize your on - screen display to your heart 's content , including worthwhile information like remaining battery life , histogram , depth of focus , and more .
With CHDK , you can customize your on - screen display to your heart 's content , including worthwhile information like remaining battery life , histogram , depth of focus , and more .
Additional Photographic Settings : CHDK takes many of the features already available on your camera and gives you way more options , including longer exposure times ( up to 65 seconds ) , faster shutter speeds ( 1/25,000 sec or faster ) , automatic bracketing of your photos , and more .
Advertisement
Support for Small Programs / Scripts : CHDK can run small scripts that will allow your camera to perform a set of actions based on the conditions of the script .
Tons of scripts are available , and they provide functionality like motion - sensing photography ( which reportedly works for lightning strikes ) and unlimited interval time - lapse photography ( see video below ) .

Even better , CHDK is being actively developed , which means that new features are always on the horizon .
There are actually several versions of CHDK in development , but the version we 're going to focus on is called the Allbest build — a build that incorporates many of the best features available in other builds ( get it ? ) .
Advertisement
What You 'll Need
Advertisement
To use CHDK , all you need is a supported Canon digital camera and an SD memory card .
If you 've already got a supported camera then it only follows that you 've got the memory card , so you 're already well on your way .
Install CHDK
Even if your camera is listed as supported , you must know your camera 's firmware version before you 're ready to install CHDK .
Here 's how .
Advertisement
Determine Your Firmware 's Version Number :
In order to determine your camera 's firmware version , you need to create an empty file on your computer called ver.req ( not ver.req.txt ) , and copy this file to the root directory of your SD card .
On Windows , for example , you could right - click your desktop , select New ->
Text File , and then rename the untitled .
txt file to ver.req .
( Windows Explorer should be set to show extensions . )
Alternately you could create an empty text file in Notepad , click File ->
Save as , name the file ver.req , and save it as type All files .
Advertisement
If your digital camera supports disk mode ( i.e. , if it shows up on your computer with a drive letter or as a mounted drive ) , all you need to do is create the empty ver.req file and copy it over to the very first level of the drive .
If your camera does not support disk mode , your best bet is to stick your SD card in a reader and then copy ver.req to the card .
Finally , if your camera does n't work in disk mode and you do n't have an SD card reader , a program called the uploader is available .
( Search for it on the linked page . )
This program is supposed to address this problem .
( I have n't tested it , but it 's supposed to upload files to cameras that do not appear as a disk . )
After you 've copied the ver.req file to your camera , determining your firmware version is simple .
Just turn your camera on ( in review mode , not in camera mode ) , press and hold Function / Set ( FUNC .
SET on my camera ) , then press and hold the Display ( DISP ) button .
Your camera should flash information on the screen , including text that looks something like this :
Firmware Ver GM1.01B
The 1.01B part is your firmware version .
Download and Install the Appropriate CHDK Files :
Now that you 've got your camera 's firmware version , you 're ready to see if it can run CHDK and then go ahead with the installation .
If you want to go with the Allbest build on your camera , head to the download page and find the build that matches both your camera and your firmware version .
For example , my camera is a Canon SD1000 , firmware version 1.01B , so the file zip file of Allbest I download looks like this :
allbest-ixus70_sd1000-101b-50.zip
You may also want to check out the firmware comparisons page to see which CHDK builds will support your camera 's firmware version .
If your camera is supported but your current firmware is not , you can download an official firmware update from Canon so that you 're using one that is .
Advertisement
Once you 've downloaded the proper build , you 'll unzip a folder containing at least two files — one called BOOTDISK .
BIN and another called PS .
FIR .
All you have to do now is copy those to files to the root of your camera 's SD card , again either by dragging them to the top level of your camera in disk mode , through a card reader , or using a program like the uploader mentioned above ( though there are special steps for Mac users ) .
Advertisement
Now that you 've installed CHDK , all that 's left is to fire it up and try it out .
As I said , CHDK is non-destructive to your current firmware , so if you just turn on your camera you wo n't notice anything different .
You have to run CHDK each time you want to use it .
Here 's how :
Run CHDK on Your Camera
Advertisement
Again , turn your camera on in review mode .
Now hit the Menu button and head all the way to the bottom of the menu options , where you should now find a Firm Update ... option ( if this is n't there , either CHDK is n't correctly installed or you did n't start in review mode ) .
Hit SET on Firm Update and you 'll be asked to confirm a firmware update .
Select OK and your camera will load CHDK , you 'll see a splash screen telling you that you 're using CHDK , and then you 'll likely see a few more bits of info on your onscreen display .
You 're now running CHDK .
How to Use CHDK
Advertisement
Before you start using CHDK 's many features , you 'll need to understand the new key settings and shortcuts for operating with CHDK .
The important thing to know is that even with CHDK running , your camera works the same as always under normal conditions .
Your buttons do the same thing as always , with the exception of one — either the direct print button or the user selectable button .
This will put your camera into what the CHDK documentation refers to as ALT mode .
When you 're in ALT mode , your camera 's keys take on new meaning .
Here 's a rundown of the most important ( you can see more on the CHDK wiki ) :
Toggle RAW : ALT mode + (+/-) key for A - series cameras ; ALT mode + FUNC for S - series ; ALT mode + ERASE for G- series
ALT mode + (+/-) key for A - series cameras ; ALT mode + FUNC for S- series ; ALT mode + ERASE for G-series Open Main Menu : ALT mode + MENU
ALT mode + MENU Toggle Histogram : ALT mode , then Half - press shutter + Up
ALT mode , then Half - press shutter + Up Toggle CHDK
On - Screen Display : ALT mode , then half - press shutter +
Right
I found that some of the shortcuts listed were hit - or - miss — for example , on my S - series camera ALT mode + DISP toggled RAW mode .
The most important thing to know is that pressing MENU in ALT mode brings up the alternate CHDK menu rather than your camera 's default menu .
From there , you can adjust virtually any of CHDK 's settings .
Advertisement
The best way to get to know CHDK is to play around with the menu to get a feel for what it has to offer .
( Be sure to check out Games under Miscellaneous stuff for a quick round of Reversi . )
If you 've never used some of the more advanced functionality on other cameras , it may seem daunting at first , but with a little effort you 'll likely learn to love your camera 's new features .
And do n't worry , if you ever tweak CHDK to a point that you 're not happy with it but you do n't know how to undo what you 've done , you can just reset all of the options .
If CHDK ever freezes and you can't turn it off , just pop out your camera 's batteries and restart .
Everything will be back to normal .
Advertisement
Extra Scripts and Other Goodies
Now that you 're running CHDK , you may want to test out its scripting capabilities .
As I mentioned , CHDK runs scripts written in a shorthand version of BASIC called UBASIC .
If you 're interested in coding scripts , you can get started here and here .
Most of us , however , just want to use scripts .
Advertisement
To do so , first you need to find and download a script .
There are tons of user submitted scripts to choose from , so just find one you like — such as a motion detection , unlimited interval shooting , or high - speed shutter and flash sync script — and download it to your computer .
Installing the script for CHDK to use is a simple matter of moving it to your SD card in the CHDK / SCRIPTS / folder .
To activate a script , open the Script menu ( ALT mode + FUNC on my camera ) , navigate to the scripts folder , and select the script .
To execute the script ( i.e. , to run it ) , just press the Shutter in ALT mode .
Advertisement
Automatically Running CHDK
Once you 've gotten comfortable with CHDK , you may want it to load automatically whenever you turn on your camera .
The CHDK wiki explains how .

I 'm new to CHDK , so if you 've been playing around with it since we first posted about it or longer , share your experience in the comments .

In America , record prices are fuelling a new Gold Rush - 160 years after thousands descended on California , seeking riches .
With uncertainty in oil and stock markets , gold is seen as a stable investment - it hit a new high of more than $ 1,000 ( £ 500 ) an ounce earlier this year and some think there is money to be made once more .
" You can pay your bills , if you live meagrely , " says John Gurney , who gave up his job six months ago to become a full - time gold prospector .
John is standing in a shallow river in Jamestown , California , in the heart of Gold Country : in 1849 , the same dream brought hundreds of thousands of people to towns like this .
He is panning for gold : he shovels rocks and dirt from the river bed into a bucket , sifts out the bigger pieces , transfers what 's left into a ridged plastic panning bowl , and then , using a light movement back and forth , shakes the bowl , separating the lighter material from the heavier , including gold .
The Motherlode Each 20 - minute session usually turns up a few tiny flecks .
" It 's not a lot of money , " John says , " but it adds up quite a bit ...
But you never know - you may hit the jackpot sometime . "
This is the simplest way of gold prospecting .
The original 49ers - as they 've become known - used this technique , as well as mining .
And in the first five years of the Gold Rush those early pioneers extracted as much as £ 6bn worth of gold , at today 's prices .
Fortunes were made - and lost - in the wild towns that sprang up almost overnight along 200 miles of central California , an area they called the Motherlode .
Tourism is big business in the former gold - mining areas Places like Jamestown and Coloma - which , in its heyday , nearly became California 's state capital - have been mining tourists ever since .
But now these ghost towns are stirring again , as more and more amateur prospectors try their luck .
Brent Shock wears a huge gold nugget as a ring ; with his long leather coat and wild eyes , he has clearly seen a thing or two in his 25 years of gold mining .
He runs gold - panning tours in Jamestown and says it is busier now than he has known it for years .
" You 've got a tremendous amount of interest from people now , " he tells me , " because gold 's at $ 1,000 an ounce . "
Buried deep Earlier this year the price of gold broke through the magical figure and it has been hovering between $ 800 and $ 900 an ounce since .
And there is plenty of gold left in California : it is estimated that the original prospectors found at most 15 % of what is thought to be there .
After a few minutes ' instruction , I panned for gold , sifting through a five - gallon ( 20l ) bucket of gravel .
In half an hour I found what Brent estimated to be worth around $ 30 .
It seemed strangely uncomplicated , and certainly gratifying .
Most of the gold that is left is not so easy to find , but buried deep in the bedrock - modern mining techniques are needed to extract it .
However , the high prices it can fetch make it financially viable , and commercial mining claims in California have rocketed 17 - fold in three years ( from 132 in the first quarter of 2005 , to 2,274 in the first quarter of 2008 ) .
Many are hoping to cash in , but why are gold prices so high ?
Near San Francisco , a city that boomed thanks to the first Gold Rush , Mike Dunn recently opened a shop selling prospecting equipment .
You can buy anything from plastic goldpans all the way up to floating dredges at $ 3,400 , with long plastic hoses for sucking up large amounts of material from the river bed .
An experienced prospector himself , Mike opened the shop partly in response to growing demand from keen amateurs .
He says gold offers stability in troubled times .
" As our ... economic slump , to put it mildly , increases , [ gold ] becomes [ an ] ultimate liquidity for people who are comfortable with it , " he told me .
" It 's been a universal form of liquidity since the time of man 's first discovery of gold .
It 's always been useful as money and typically at the higher end of the scale ...
What 's going to happen in two weeks , three weeks in oil , I do n't know , but I know gold will be stable .
" With gold you can always get a suit and a steak and I think that 's important . "
Glittering past
In the studied atmosphere of the What Cheer Saloon in Columbia , Ben the barman wears period costume but serves modern drinks .
A sign outside offers sarsparilla ( an old type of root beer ) .
All along the main street in fact are shops and signs from a bygone age - Columbia is a living museum to its glittering past .
And a couple of regulars are pondering this Second Gold Rush .
" It 's good for this place because it brings tourism , " Pat Narry says .
" Tourism has always been gold ! " Bob Beck tells me : " Areas have been milked dry but with the rain and the seasons the gold comes to the surface ... so they 're praying .
At $ 1,000 an ounce , they 're praying ! "
Back at the creek in Jamestown a group from the east coast are trying their hand at gold - panning .
Just like in 1849 .
History is repeating in places like this : many will dig deep , few will make fortunes in California 's new Gold Rush .

Meet Paddy Donnelly and Lee Munroe .
They 're selling words at a buck per letter .
Donnelly , 22 , and Munroe , 23 — graduate students at the University of Ulster - Belfast — dreamed up the Big Word Project while brainstorming a mass collaboration Web site that would let Donnelly use his viral marketing ideas and Munroe hone his Ruby on Rails skills .
" Words mean different things to different people , " Donnelly says , " so we thought , why not let people redefine them ? "
When you buy a word on thebigwordproject.com , you can link that term from the dictionary - like site to any other site , which then becomes the word 's new " definition . "
It 's also a cheap way to place an ad — granted to a limited audience of word nerds .

Billets pour la Tour Eiffel
La Tour Eiffel , située sur la rive gauche de la Seine à Paris , est un symbole emblématique de la France et l'un des bâtiments les plus célèbres au monde .
La tour a été conçue par Gustave Eiffel pour l'Exposition Universelle de 1889 , dans le but de commémorer le centenaire de la Révolution française .
Eiffel était un ingénieur civil renommé , spécialisé dans la construction en fer .
Il avait déjà travaillé sur le cadre structurel de la Statue de la Liberté à New York , qui , avec ses 320 mètres , devenait le plus haut bâtiment du monde à son achèvement .
titre jusqu’à ce que le Chrysler Building de New York soit terminé en 1930 .
Cependant , avant et après son achèvement , il a fait face à une opposition féroce de la part des critiques , notamment une pétition contre la " tour ridicule dominant Paris comme une gigantesque cheminée noire " .
La requête mal interprétée a par la suite été reprise dans la défense de la construction du Centre Pompidou , qui avait fait l'objet de critiques similaires .
La tour a également évité de justesse d'être démantelée par les Français eux - mêmes et détruite par les nazis envahisseurs .
Malgré ces premières années difficiles , elle est devenue l'un des monuments les plus populaires au monde .
Elle compte environ 7 millions de visiteurs par an. différentes hauteurs de plate - forme .

La tour Eiffel est toujours la pièce maîtresse du paysage urbain de Paris .
Plus de 7 millions de personnes visitent cette tour emblématique chaque année , selon le site officiel de l'attraction .
Depuis l'ouverture de la tour en 1889 , 250 millions de personnes du monde entier ont profité de tout ce que la tour Eiffel a à offrir .
Et cela a beaucoup à offrir .

La Tour Eiffel
Conception et construction
Le gouvernement français a envisagé de créer un monument approprié pour marquer l’Exposition Universelle avant de se décider pour le projet en fer forgé à treillis ouvert d’Eiffel .
L’idée d’Eiffel était que les quatre piliers soient alignés sur les points cardinaux .
La tour est construite en fer structural très pur , ce qui la rend relativement extrêmement légère et lui permet de se déplacer sous une forte charge de vent .
La construction de la tour était une réalisation architecturale remarquable .
Environ 18 038 pièces de fer ont été assemblées et 2,5 millions de rivets par environ 300 ouvriers sidérurgistes , en seulement 2 ans , 2 mois et 5 jours .
Malgré son succès touristique , la tour Eiffel devait à l'origine être une structure temporaire .
Le terrain sur lequel se trouvait la tour était considéré comme ayant une valeur trop élevée pour être dominée par celle - ci ; il a donc été envisagé de la démanteler .
Ces plans ont été abandonnés lorsque la Première Guerre mondiale a éclaté et la tour a été adaptée pour devenir un centre de radio et de télégraphe militaire .
Lorsque les nazis firent face à la fin de leur occupation de Paris , Hitler ordonna de détruire la tour , ainsi que la cathédrale Notre - Dame .
cependant , ces ordres ont été désobéis .
Suite à une mauvaise gestion , la tour était en mauvais état en 1980 et nécessitait d'importants et coûteux travaux de rénovation et de restauration , notamment l'installation de nouveaux ascenseurs et de nouvelles peintures .
Avec ses restaurants et diverses autres expositions et installations , la Tour Eiffel reste une icône durable de l'environnement bâti et de la France en tant que pays , avec de nombreuses imitations dans le monde , notamment à Las Vegas .
Il est régulièrement utilisé comme élément central des événements et on estime que 250 millions de personnes l’ont visité depuis 1889 .
Données du projet Tour Eiffel
Lieu : 7ème arrondissement , Paris , France .
Période de construction : 1887 - 1889 .

La forme de la Tour Eiffel est incontestablement moderne , ce qui la distingue des styles néo-gothique , néo-Renaissance et néo-baroque qui étaient populaires aux 18e et 19e siècles , selon Gudek Snajdar .
Mais son matériau l'a vraiment fait ressortir .
" La tour Eiffel a été l'un des premiers exemples de l'architecture moderne à cause du fer " , a déclaré Gudek Snajdar .
" Et le fait que le bâtiment n'avait pas de but en particulier . "
Elle visait uniquement à montrer au monde la créativité architecturale française et la maîtrise des matériaux ; il était imprégné de sens mais pas d’utilité .
Selon Gudek Snajdar , la tour Eiffel est également une structure plus démocratique , et donc moderne , que d'autres monuments de l'époque .
Petition to Demand Hearings on Substandard Helmet Procurement
We the undersigned call upon the United States Congress to investigate how Sioux Manufacturing received a contract from the Bush Administration ’s Pentagon to produce Kevlar helmets for our troops , after the company was found to have previously produced substandard helmets in the past .
As detailed by the New York Times :
“ A North Dakota manufacturer has agreed to pay $ 2 million to settle a suit saying it had repeatedly shortchanged the armor in up to 2.2 million helmets for the military , including those for the first troops sent to Iraq and Afghanistan .
Twelve days before the settlement with the Justice Department was announced , the company , Sioux Manufacturing of Fort Totten , was given a new contract of up to $ 74 million to make more armor for helmets to replace the old ones , which were made from the late 1980s to last year . ”
For years , Sioux Manufacturing had produced helmets that were far weaker than required by the U.S. Military and covered it up .
Again , the New York Times reports :
In a conversation Mr. Kenner secretly taped , Rhea Crane , quality assurance officer , worried " if we ever had someone get killed , and they decided to investigate because they thought maybe the helmet was n't any good . "
" If we ever got audited , " she said , " you know what they would do to us .
Shut us down and fine us big time .
Probably never see another government contract . "
Additionally , on November 12 , 2007 , the Bismarck Tribune reported that Sioux , also while being sued , received one of three contracts to produce MRAPs for the troops .
Sioux should have never gotten another contract , and yet they got two , even as the company was being sued by the government .
Congress must immediately investigate how this was allowed to happen .
House Republican leader John Boehner argues that political pundits are wrong and that his party will pick up seats in the House in the 2008 election and might even regain the majority it lost in November 2006 .
" We will gain seats this year , period .
I mentioned the difficulty , the challenge we will have in earning back a majority .
But that is my goal ....
I am leading an effort for us to earn our way back , and I think it is possible , " Representative Boehner said at a Monitor - sponsored lunch with reporters on Thursday .
The blunt - spoken Boehner said that " part of the basis " for his optimism is that the presidential primary battle between Sen.
Hillary Rodham Clinton and Sen. Barack Obama could lead lasting scars .
" One side is going to be sorely disappointed when they have a nominee , " the House minority leader said .
" What is n't measured , and can't be measured , is the number of people who are disappointed who just do n't show up and vote ....
The longer this goes on , there are going to be some very disappointed people . "
The eventual Democratic nominee will have weaknesses that Sen. John McCain , the Republican nominee , can exploit , Boehner said .
" We are going to face either one of the most polarizing people in American politics or the most liberal senator in the United States Senate , " he said .
Impartial experts take a much dimmer view than Boehner of the Republicans ' chances of picking up seats in the House this fall .
If Republicans win a majority of House seats , Boehner would be in line to be speaker .
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report ( no relation to the writer ) says that , " If elections were held today , Democrats would be poised to gain between five and ten seats in the House . "
A respected political handicapper , the Cook Report also observes , " Most Republicans outside of the party 's spin room view the prospect of regaining the majority as a longer - term proposition .
Instead , the real question is whether the GOP can hold the election to something near a wash or Democrats are poised for another double - digit gain . "
" I am not here suggesting to you it will be an easy walk back for us to earn our majority , " Boehner said .
" I understand the difficulty , but I am here to suggest to you that it is going to be a far better Republican year than most people realize . "
While his predictions were optimistic , they were delivered along with some tough talk about the Ohio Republican 's own party .
Referring to the fact that Democrats are outdoing Republicans in fundraising this political cycle , Boehner said , " On the resource side , we are not doing well . "
But he added , " We will have what we need to be competitive . "
Commenting on the large number of Republican House members who have announced their retirement this year , Boehner acknowledged , " There are some retirements that were probably good – good for the member who was in the seat and better for us in terms of holding onto the seat . "
Boehner said he viewed himself as a leader " trying to rebuild our team " and " stand on principle . "
He noted , " The Republican brand has been damaged , but I do n't want to lay it at the feet of the [ Bush ] administration .
There are a lot of people to blame .
We kind of lost our way when it comes to the issue of fiscal responsibility , earmarks out of control .
And frankly , by [ February ] ' 06 , when I became the majority leader , I was trying to plug the holes and keep the ship afloat . "

Police are asking residents to submit to voluntary searches in exchange for amnesty under the District ’s gun ban .
They passed out fliers requesting cooperation on Monday .
The program will begin in a couple of weeks in the Washington Highlands neighborhood of southeast Washington and will later expand to other neighborhoods .
Officers will go door to door asking residents for permission to search their homes .
Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier said the “ safe homes initiative ” is aimed at residents who want to cooperate with police .
She gave the example of parents or grandparents who know or suspect their children have guns in the home .
Community leaders went door to door in Ward 8 Monday to advise residents not to invite police into their homes to search for weapons .
“ Bad idea , ” said D.C. School Board member William Lockridge .
“ I think the people should not open your doors under any circumstances , do n’t even crack your door , unless someone has a warrant for your arrest . ”

The risk of eavesdropping has driven the Dutch government to ban electronic voting computers from future elections .
The Ministry of Internal Affairs says that the development of safer voting computers has " insufficient added value over voting by paper and pencil " .
Dutch election officials will return to using paper ballots instead .
The decision is a victory for the obliquely - named Dutch We Don't Trust Voting Computers Foundation , which in the past demonstrated that many Dutch e-voting machines could be easily intercepted from 20 to 30 metres away .
Dutch intelligence service AIVD tested over 1200 Sdu e-voting machines in October , and deemed them totally unreliable .
The radio signals used by the computers to record votes could be intercepted without difficulty .
Minister for Administrative Reform Atzo Nicolai immediately withdrew the permit for the use of the computers in the provincial elections in March 2008 .
The Dutch government had decided last year to pull the plug on its e-voting venture , citing the lack of a paper trail as its biggest shortcoming .
With no automated paper counting solution deployed , the Dutch will have to revert back to the humble pencil .
A group of experts headed by professor Bart Jacobs told Dutch site Webwereld that " even with meticulous testing it would have been almost impossible to safeguard printers against eavesdropping " .
Voting machine manufacturer Nedap says it is disappointed by the decision .
" It would have been technically possible to prevent eavesdropping altogether , " the company says .
" And now that we return to paper voting , is n't there a risk voters can be filmed with webcams ? " ®
I 've been roaming across the States the past few weeks – spent a few days in Boston / Providence and a few days in L.A .
Although they 're on opposite coasts , the two locations do have one thing in common : residences that make me feel like I live in a shack .
A hovel , really .
Do n't get me wrong , I really do love my house , but how can you compare that with mansions built by the Vanderbilts and the Winchesters ?
Let 's start with the first house that made me feel inadequate .
The Breakers , Newport , R.I .
photo from Stacy Conradt
Believe it or not , this incredible manse is merely a summer home for the Vanderbilts .
Cornelius Vanderbilt II commissioned the quaint little cottage in 1893 .
It cost more than $ 7 million to build , which is pretty astronomical when you account for inflation – it would be more than $ 150 million today .
The mansion that had previously occupied that spot burned down the year before Vanderbilt had the Breakers constructed , so one of his building criteria was that the building should be as fireproof as possible , including using steel instead of wood wherever possible .
The furnace is even located under the street instead of actually inside of the house .
If the outside of the house is n't opulent enough for you , venture inside to see vast halls made out of marble from Italy and Africa .
The Gold Room was actually build in France , then disassembled and shipped in airtight cases to be rebuilt once it arrived in Newport .
When Cornelius died in 1899 , he left the house to his wife , Alice Gwynne Vanderbilt .
When she died , the house was given to her youngest daughter Gladys because Gladys did n't have any American real estate .
In turn , Countess Gladys left the house to her daughter , Countess Sylvia .
Countess Sylvia lived there until she died in 1998 , but her children , Gladys and Paul Szapary , still summer there .
They stay on the third floor , where the 300,000 tourists the Breakers gets every year are not allowed to visit .
The Mansion , Los Angeles , Calif .
photo from LaurelCanyon.org
Now we hop coasts and visit the Mansion , owned by music producer Rick Rubin .
The Mansion is supposedly haunted , but that has n't stopped artists from recording some of their biggest hits there .
Just a sample of albums recorded at the Mansion include the Red Hot Chili Peppers ' Blood Sugar Sex Magik and Stadium Arcadium , Jay - Z's 99 Problems and Maroon 5's It Wo n't Be Soon Before Long .
The Chili Peppers ' drummer , Chad Smith , was so convinced of paranormal activity within the house that he refused to spend the night there when the band was recording .
There is good reason to suspect that the Mansion might be haunted – in 1918 , a man fell from a balcony on the house to his death .
After that , the house was inhabited by none other than Harry Houdini .
The original Houdini Mansion burned nearly to the ground in 1959 , but that apparently did n't deter any ghosts from haunting the new structure built in the same spot .
The band Slipknot ( from Des Moines ! ! ) had numerous supernatural experience there when they recorded Vol. 3 : ( The Subliminal Verses ) .
Singer Corey
Taylor took pictures that appeared to show two hovering orbs and drummer Joey Jordison had a strange experience in the basement that he wo n't talk about .
Greystone Mansion , Beverly Hills , Calif .
photo from Beverlyhills.org
If you 've seen There Will Be Blood , you 'll recognize Greystone Mansion ( aka Doheny Mansion ) as the place where Daniel Day - Lewis uttered the now - famous words , " I. Drink .
Your .
Milkshake . I DRINK IT UP . "
And if you have n't seen There Will Be Blood , then you 've undoubtedly seen Batman , the Big Lebowski , the Bodyguard , Death Becomes Her , Entourage , Ghostbusters , Indecent Proposal , X - Men or National Treasure .
Oh , and the music video for Meatloaf 's I 'd do Anything For Love ( But I Wo n't Do That ) .
All of those movies ( and more ) were filmed on location at Greystone .
The mansion actually has the most in common with There Will Be Blood , though – the house was a gift from oil tycoon Edward Doheny to his son , Ned Doheny .
It was built in 1928 and cost more than $ 3 million , making it the most expensive house in California at the time .
Ned did n't get much time to enjoy the house , though – just four months after he , his wife and their five children moved in , he was found dead in his bedroom along with his secretary , Hugh Plunkett .
It was apparently a murder - suicide orchestrated by Plunkett .
The Winchester Mystery House , San Jose , Calif .
photo from WinchesterMysteryHouse.com
I 've always wanted to visit this house .
Sarah Winchester , widow of gun magnate William Wirt Winchester , built this house continuously from 1884 to 1922 .
That 's 38 years that workers were constantly sawing , hammering and building , twenty - hour hours a day .
The house stood at seven stories , but the 1906 earthquake claimed three of those stories and today it stands just four stories tall .
There are 17 chimneys , 40 bedrooms , two basements , 467 doorways , at least five kitchens , two ballrooms and approximately 52 skylights .
Why such a large , distorted house ?
Sarah believed that the ghosts of all of the people killed by the guns bearing her husband 's name were out for revenge .
She believed very deeply in the spirit world , so when a medium told her that she needed to build a house to contain herself and all of the restless spirits , she took it seriously .
The medium told her that if construction ever stopped on the house , the spirits would claim her .
When she died in 1922 , construction stopped immediately – nails half - pounded into the wall can be found in the house to this day .
There are some odd features in this maze of a house , including doors that lead to nowhere , stairs that lead straight into a ceiling , closets with no floors and numerous secret passageways .
Fair Lane , Dearborn , Mich .
photo from wikipedia.com
Now that we 've visited both coasts , let 's check out what 's in between .
Fair Lane was the home of Henry and Clara Ford and was named for an area in Ireland where Henry 's grandfather was born .
Ford is n't the only luminary to be involved with the house , though .
Frank Lloyd Wright helped draw up the original design for the house before leaving for Europe .
And Thomas Edison himself laid the cornerstone of the estate 's powerhouse .
The top floor of the powerhouse was reserved for Ford 's Experimental Laboratory – the place he would go to tinker around with new ideas .
Despite Ford 's great wealth , the house really was n't considered that extravagant by the standards of the day , even though it did have an indoor poor and a bowling alley .
That 's not to say that Fair Lane did n't have it 's share of strange extravagances , though .
As an avid bird watcher , Ford had a steam - heated birdbath installed to entice birds to make the estate their permanent dwelling as well .
Oh , and if Fair Lane sounds familiar , it should – the Fairlane Ford cars were named after the mansion .
Bannerman 's Castle , Pollepal Island , N.Y .
photo from Bannerman Castle Trust
Drive just 50 miles away from the sleek , modern skyscrapers of New York City and you 'll find yourself at Bannerman 's Castle – about as opposite from " sleek and modern " as you can get .
Francis Bannerman VI bought the island in 1900 to use as an arsenal .
Bannerman bought 90 percent of the U.S. army 's leftover supplies from the Spanish - American War and thought that the island would be an ideal place to keep them .
He even advertised that fact by having " Bannerman 's Island Arsenal " engraved into a wall that faced the eastern bank of the Hudson River .
In 1920 , the arsenal backfired – literally .
Two hundred pounds of shells and gunpowder exploded , destroying a good chunk of the castle and its surrounding buildings .
New York State bought the island and all of its buildings in 1967 , but after a fire consumed the grounds in 1969 , the castle and the island were pretty much abandoned by all .
In recent years , tours have been conducted by Bannerman 's Castle Trust , but only if tourees consent to wear a hard hat .
Australia 's Prime Minister Kevin Rudd is looking for big ideas A government - led summit on the future of Australia has led to renewed calls for a republic and the end of the British monarch as the head of state .
Australia 's foreign minister Stephen Smith said a split from the British monarchy was " inevitable " .
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd invited 1,000 people , including actors Cate Blanchett and Hugh Jackman , to the two - day summit to brainstorm ideas .
Aboriginal issues and climate change are also on the Australia 2020 agenda .
The meeting , which started on Saturday in the capital Canberra , has brought together Australia 's best and brightest brains with the aim of plotting the country 's future trajectory .
Delegate cheers
A move towards a republic is one of the main ideas being put forward , with the panel on governance originally agreeing on a 12 - year target to have an Australian head of state .
But the government 's home affairs minister , Bob Debus , challenged the group to agree to a shorter time frame - a Republic by 2010 which drew cheers from many delegates .
Mr Rudd , whose election in November ended almost 12 years of conservative rule , is a longstanding republican but he has said he does not regard it as a high priority .
On Sunday , Mr Smith said while the centre - left Labour government favoured a split from the country 's former colonial power , it was not an urgent matter .
" I regard it as inevitable .
I do n't see it occurring in 2010 , " he told Australia 's Network Ten .
" It 's one of those things I think the nation will attend to in due course . "
In the weeks leading up to the summit , radio talk shows invited listeners to call with ideas and about 9,000 messages were sent to the Australia 2020 website .
Final proposals will be delivered to the government but there is no certainty any will be implemented .
Setting 10 themes for discussion , Mr Rudd said : " The old way of governing has long been creaking and groaning .
" Some of these ideas we will be able to embrace , others we will not , and some we will take in part and change . "

The perfect voice would have elements of Dame Judi Dench Researchers say they have worked out a mathematical formula to find the perfect human voice .
The study , commissioned by Post Office Telecoms , asked people to rate 50 voices then analysed the results .
It found the best female voice to be a mixture of Mariella Frostrup , Dame Judi Dench and Honor Blackman .
Alan Rickman and Jeremy Irons did best for the men .
The research was conducted by linguist Andrew Linn , of Sheffield University , and sound engineer Shannon Harris .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
They concluded the ideal voice should utter no more than 164 words per minute and pause for 0.48 seconds between sentences .
Sentences themselves should fall rather than rise in intonation .
Vocal traits associated with positive characteristics , such as confidence and trust , scored highly with listeners .
This formula gives us an exciting glimpse into the way voices work and what makes them appealing or repelling
Professor Andrew Linn Professor
Linn said : " As humans we instinctively know which voices send shivers down our spine and which make us shudder with disgust .
" The emotional responses panellists had to the voices were surprising and go some way to explaining how voiceover artists or radio DJs are selected , or why particular celebrity voices appeal . "

He said most men found presenter Mariella Frostrup 's voice " mesmerising " because it was deep , slow and confident .
Actor Jeremy
Irons came very close to the ideal voice model , speaking at 200 words per minute and pausing for 1.2 seconds between sentences .
Professor Linn said this explained why his " deep gravelly tones " inspired trust in listeners .
He said : " This formula gives us an exciting glimpse into the way voices work and what makes them appealing or repelling . "
The formula showed the BBC's Jonathan Ross , on the other hand , spoke too quickly , with very short pauses between sentences .
The researchers said the presenter 's varied range of voice , with frequent highs and lows was associated with expressiveness and intelligence .
But his rising intonation was usually linked with someone weak or unsure .

Late last year , disc - copying software maker SlySoft claimed they cracked the BD + DRM protection in Blu-ray discs .
They were n't kidding .
The newest version of AnyDVD HD strips Blu-ray discs of BD+ , allowing you to copy even the most locked - up Blu-ray discs ( * cough * Fox* cough * ) to your heart 's content — assuming the copies are for personal use , of course .
On the DVD front , the updated software rips movies that can't be read by Windows , and can now get around most ARccOS protection .
Sounds like a reasonable temptation to all you pirate types , so run along , have at it and report back to us .

BONN , Germany ( Reuters ) -
One in eight of the world ’s birds are at risk of extinction as climate change puts birds under great pressure , a leading conservation group warned on Monday .

The population of rare birds such as the Floreana mockingbird of the Galapagos Islands or the spoon - billed sandpiper , which breeds in northeastern Russia and winters in south Asia , has declined sharply and they could go extinct , the International Union for Conservation of Nature said in a report .
The 2008 “ Red List for Birds ” report , published on the first day of a May 19 - 30 U.N. conference about biodiversity in the German city of Bonn , said 1,226 species of bird were now threatened .
The annual report , closely watched among conservationists , added eight of the world ’s 10,000 bird species to the Critically Endangered category , the greatest level of threat .
“ The latest update of the IUCN Red List shows that birds are under enormous pressure from climate change , ” said Jane Smart , head of the IUCN Species Programme .
The IUCN groups governments , conservation groups and scientists .
Long - term drought and sudden extreme weather are putting additional stress on habitats that threatened species depend on , said the report , noting that extinction rates were rising on continents , rather than on islands where , historically , most extinctions have occurred .
Of the 26 species that moved category due to changes in their population size , rate of decline or range size , 24 were moved up to a higher level of threat .
CURLEW , WARBLER
They included the Eurasian curlew and Dartford warbler , which lives in Europe and north - west Africa .
Both were previously in the “ Least Threatened ” category .
“ We urge governments to take the information contained in ( the report ) seriously and do their level best to protect the world ’s birds , ” said Smart .
The U.N. Climate Panel says that burning of fossil fuels is stoking global warming .
The report showed that Brazil and Indonesia had the highest number of threatened bird species with 141 and 133 respectively .
The group picked out several other species , including the Mallee emuwren in Australia which has suffered from years of drought and is seeing its population shrink sharply .
Its habitat has become so fragmented that a single bushfire could be catastrophic , said the report .
In the Galapagos Islands , the population of the Floreana mockingbird has fallen to fewer than 60 from an estimated 150 in 1996 and is now on the Critically Endangered list because the species is vulnerable to extreme weather .
The report also pointed to some species that had fared better as a result of conservation efforts , including the Marquesan Imperial - pigeon and the little spotted kiwi .
Around 4,000 delegates at the U.N. meeting of the Convention on Biodiversity will discuss ways to safeguard the range of species and try to slow the rate of extinctions among plants and animals .
The main character in the movie Lost Weekend is Don Birnam , a charming writer who is hopelessly addicted to drinking alcohol .
His writing career is adversely affected by his addiction to alcohol .
He is sharing his apartment with his brother Wick in New York and has a girlfriend Helen St James who is love with him .
Both his brother and girlfriend realize that his addiction is adversely affecting his life , and do everything possible to ensure that he does not drink alcohol .
After they have kept him sober for ten days , they plan a weekend in the countryside so that he can get a break from his routine and remain alcohol - free .
Canada business visa
However , Don Birnam is so addicted to alcohol , that he manages to avoid the weekend getaway sending his brother with his girlfriend to remain alone .
He then remains at home and desperately searches for money to purchase alcohol .
He is willing to pawn his typewriter for money .
He finally finds ten dollars which were kept for the cleaning lady and goes to his favorite bar and liquor store .
There he goes on a four - day drinking binge , sharing the story of his life with anyone who listens .
He is then hospitalized for some time , and when he returns home , he contemplates suicide .
A DECADE AGO , those monotonous minutes were just a fact of life : time ticking away , as you gazed idly into space , stood in line , or sat in bumper - to - bumper traffic .
Boredom 's doldrums were unavoidable , yet also a primordial soup for some of life 's most quintessentially human moments .
Jostled by a stranger 's cart in the express checkout line , thoughts of a loved one might come to mind .
A long drive home after a frustrating day could force ruminations .
A pang of homesickness at the start of a plane ride might put a journey in perspective .
Increasingly , these empty moments are being saturated with productivity , communication , and the digital distractions offered by an ever - expanding array of slick mobile devices .
A few years ago , cellphone maker Motorola even began using the word " microboredom " to describe the ever - smaller slices of free time from which new mobile technology offers an escape .
" Mobisodes , " two - minute long television episodes of everything from " Lost " to " Prison Break " made for the cellphone screen , are perfectly tailored for the microbored .
Cellphone games are often designed to last just minutes -- simple , snack - sized diversions like Snake , solitaire , and Tetris .
Social networks like Twitter and Facebook turn every mundane moment between activities into a chance to broadcast feelings and thoughts ; even if it is just to triple - tap a keypad with the words " I am bored . "
But are we too busy twirling through the songs on our iPods -- while checking e-mail , while changing lanes on the highway -- to consider whether we are giving up a good thing ?
We are most human when we feel dull .
Lolling around in a state of restlessness is one of life 's greatest luxuries -- one not available to creatures that spend all their time pursuing mere survival .
To be bored is to stop reacting to the external world , and to explore the internal one .
It is in these times of reflection that people often discover something new , whether it is an epiphany about a relationship or a new theory about the way the universe works .
Granted , many people emerge from boredom feeling that they have accomplished nothing .
But is accomplishment really the point of life ?
There is a strong argument that boredom -- so often parodied as a glassy - eyed drooling state of nothingness -- is an essential human emotion that underlies art , literature , philosophy , science , and even love .
" If you think of boredom as the prelude to creativity , and loneliness as the prelude to engagement of the imagination , then they are good things , " said Dr. Edward Hallowell , a Sudbury psychiatrist and author of the book " CrazyBusy . "
" They are doorways to something better , as opposed to something to be abhorred and eradicated immediately . "
Public health officials often bemoan the obesity epidemic , the unintended consequence of a modern lifestyle that allows easy access to calories .
Technology seems to offer a similar proposition : a wide array of distractions that offer the boon of connection , but at a cost .
Already , mobile technology has shaped the way people interact and communicate .
People no longer make plans in the same way ; public spaces have become semi-private bubbles of conversation ; and things like getting a busy signal or being unreachable seem foreign , even quaint .
Today , distraction from monotony is not just merely available ; it is almost unavoidable .
Perhaps nothing illuminates the speed of social change better than the new fear of disconnection .
People driving a car or standing at a bus stop or waiting in a doctor 's office by themselves have always had some distractions available to them , from the radio to National Geographic .
But until the advent of connected devices , they were still , fundamentally , alone in some way .
Today , there is a growing fear of the prospect of being untethered in the world without the security blanket of a cellphone .
In the timescale of human inventions , the mobile phone is still new , but it is already a crucial part of the trinity of things people fear to forget when they leave the house -- keys , wallet , and phone .
" There is this hyper - anxiety over feeling lonely or disconnected , " said Kathleen Cumiskey , a professor of psychology and women 's studies at the College of Staten Island who says her stepdaughter sleeps with her cellphone at arm 's length and considers turning the device off unthinkable .
" Our society is perpetually anxious , and a way to alleviate the anxiety is to delve into something that 's very within our control , pleasurable , and fun . . . . It feels like it has all the makings of addiction . "
In a way , the entrepreneurs looking to capitalize on the small moments of spare time that are sprinkled through modern life parallel the pharmaceutical industry .
A growing chorus of mental health specialists has begun to question whether normal sadness and social anxiety are being transformed into disorders that people believe need to be cured -- by the companies offering elixirs .
The tech industry may be doing the same thing with disconnection .
Many of the original arguments for having a cellphone -- safety , security , emergencies -- never figure into the advertisements .
Like the commercials that show frowning people transformed into smiling , kitten - cuddling normality , technology companies project a happy world of connection where to intentionally disconnect seems freakish , questionable , undeniably an ailment .
Society has accepted connection so well that it takes a step back to see exactly how far things have come .
Instead of carrying their entire social universe in a pocket , people used to walk out of their houses and into the world .
Today , not picking up the phone for an hour is an act of defiance .
. . .
Perhaps understandably , boredom has never caught the attention of the psychological world .
Emotions like anxiety , fear , or anger have been subjected to a much more thorough examination than merely feeling drab , according to Richard Ralley , a lecturer in psychology at Edge Hill University in England .
" What 's gone wrong with the psychology of emotion is that the ones that are easy to do are the ones that have been researched : fear , threat , fear , threat , again and again and again , " Ralley said .
" A lot of other emotions that really make us human -- pride , for instance , we kind of avoid . "
So , Ralley set out to examine boredom more closely , with the idea that the feeling must have a purpose .
Just looking around , it was evident that children quell boredom quite naturally , with creativity -- even to the point of taking the packaging around a gift and playing with it for hours .
But as people get older , anxious parents and cranky children demand more and more specific stimuli , whether it is a video game or a hot new phone .
As Ralley studied boredom , it came to make a kind of sense :
If people are slogging away at an activity with little reward , they get annoyed and find themselves feeling bored .
If something more engaging comes along , they move on .
If nothing does , they may be motivated enough to think of something new themselves .
The most creative people , he said , are known to have the greatest toleration for long periods of uncertainty and boredom .
In one of the most famous scenes in literature , for instance , boredom takes time .
Marcel Proust describes his protagonist , Marcel , dunking a madeleine cookie into his teacup .
" Dispirited after a dreary day with the prospect of a depressing morrow , I raised to my lips a spoonful of the tea in which I had soaked a morsel of the cake , " Proust wrote .
" And at once the vicissitudes of life had become indifferent to me , its disasters innocuous , its brevity illusory . . .
I had ceased now to feel mediocre , contingent , mortal . "
Marcel 's senses are recalibrated , his experiences deepened , and the very nature of memory begins to reveal itself .
But it is only through the strenuous process of clearing his mind and concentrating that his thoughts begin to unfurl completely , immersing him in memory .
Had Marcel been holding a silver clamshell phone in his hand instead of the delicately scalloped cookie , perhaps he could have quieted the boredom with a quick game of cellphone Tetris .
And had Proust come of age with an iPhone in his hand and the expectation that his entire world fit in his pocket , he may never have written his grandiose novel .
" When we 're writing deeply , writing thoughtfully , we are often trying to communicate with ourselves and trying to communicate what ultimately can't be communicated -- the greatest mysteries of the world : what is truth ; what is beauty ; what is being ? " said Eric G. Wilson , an English professor at Wake Forest University and author of the new book , " Against Happiness . "
Arthur Wright , 55 , who works in the travel industry , said that he refuses to carry a cellphone precisely because he has sees the effects every time he ventures out into one of the confession booths our public spaces have become .
" You hear these stupid conversations .
. . .
You know , it 's just ' I 'm bored , ' and they 'll call and chit - chat on the phone , " Wright said .
" ' I 'm almost there , I 'm turning the corner right now . '{ hellip}
What would they do without it ?
It 's like kids who use a calculator in school , and they can't add . "
It did n't have to turn out this way .
While profound global economic forces over the past generation have impacted the GTA economy , social policy analysts and anti-poverty campaigners say governments have exacerbated the income divide between rich and poor .
From slashing taxes and punching holes in the social safety net to making it harder for professional immigrants to get work in their field of expertise , they say decisions at Queen 's Park and in Ottawa have meant that low and middle - income earners have largely missed out on the benefits of a period of sustained economic growth .
" Trickle down was supposed to create jobs and jobs were supposed to create prosperity , " said Armine Yalnizyan , a senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives .
" Well , we got the jobs but we ain't got the prosperity . "
Yalnizyan and others said free trade deals and increasing globalization have lead to a dramatic loss in lower - skilled manufacturing jobs across the GTA over much of the past 20 years .
And , in place of those well - paid positions with benefits is a higher percentage of lower - salaried service industry ones and part - time work with few benefits or job security .
Meanwhile , higher - skilled and more - educated employees have seen their incomes swell , fuelled in part by a disproportionate benefit from tax cuts .
The Toronto snapshot of the widening gap between the incomes of rich and poor highlighted by the latest Statistics Canada census figures " makes us start to question whether in our city we have the ability for people to get jobs that you can support a family on , " said Frances Lankin , president of the United Way of Greater Toronto .
" We 're seeing a huge growth in the working poor , " Lankin said .
" And , looking behind those numbers we see the impact on people , particularly the crippling factor it has on kids being raised in a family that 's not economically secure . "
Also alarming , Lankin said , is the increase in impoverished single - family homes .
That points to , among other things , the need for more low - cost child care and enhanced social housing , she said .
At the same time as there 's been no replacement for those good - paying jobs , Lankin and others note there 's been a reduction in social programs from both senior levels of government , increasing the divide .
They point to Employment Insurance eligibility rules being tightened , making it much more difficult for those working these low - paying jobs on the fringe to qualify .
Welfare rates in Ontario , slashed more than a decade ago , are increasing , but remain too low while the minimum wage is rising but not to a rate that someone can live on .
" Most of the elements that have created this growing gap in wages are the result of conscious decisions and choices made by our political and corporate leaders , " said John Cartwright , president of the Toronto and York Region Labour Council .
" It 's not inevitable . "
From free trade deals and World Trade Organization negotiations that failed to better protect our manufacturing sector to the contracting out of government jobs and weakening of union protection , Cartwright said , " middle - wage jobs have become poverty - wage jobs . "
David Pecaut , chair of the Toronto City Summit Alliance , a coalition dedicated to improving life in the city , said " it 's very dismaying " to see declines in real wages at the low end .

And , he said , given that immigrants will drive future labour force growth in the GTA , it 's particularly frustrating that they 're still finding it difficult " getting traction " because of questions over their foreign credentials and certification .
" It does n't make sense to bring nurses here or engineers and then put them through all kinds of hoops that do n't let them get in the labour force quickly , " said Pecaut .
From pretend play to house - rules stick ball to hastily conceived tabletop RPGs , making up your own games has been a childhood staple for as long as there have been kids with ample free time and unbridled creativity .
14 - year - old Anshul Samar has taken this to its logical conclusion by creating , and now actively seeking backing to help mass produce , his own science - based fantasy card combat game Elementeo .
The game is based on a 121 - card deck of chemical elements , compounds and catalysts .
Every card has an explanation of the element or compound 's uses and chemical properties .
For example , the Oxygen card can rust neighboring metal cards and the Copper Conductor card can shock any metals .
The oxidation state of an element is used as its attack power , and its physical state determines its movement on the board .
The goal of the game is to reduce the opponents electrons to zero through strategic use of each card 's chemical properties .
With $ 500 in seed money from the California Association of the Gifted , Samar crafted a prototype of the two - player CCG that went on to wow them at entrepreneur conference TiECON 2007 .
And with a unique blend of personal ingenuity , scientific know - how , and a good , old fashioned fantasy slant , this story is sure to thrill GeekDads everywhere .
Link to the game 's website , where it can be pre-ordered .
Which begs the question : what types of interesting and exciting games have you and your geeklings concocted ?

Ron and Maria Passi , who operate Murray Island 's only taxi , were out driving the night the king tide struck .
Neighbours flagged them down , asking for help , and so it was not until some time later that they saw their own grandchildren standing in the road .
" They were shouting ' Granddad , stop the car , the water is coming in the house ' , " says Ron .
" I just slammed on the brakes . "
The couple 's son , Sonny , was outside his fibro shack with his five children , watching the monster surf , lashed by north - west winds , rise ever higher .
In the commotion , everyone had forgotten that Sedoi , the baby , was still inside .
They heard her crying and found her in her cot , covered in sand .
Water had surged in after a wave picked up a big wooden pallet and flung it through the front wall .
No one on Murray had ever seen such a high tide before .
Other islands in the Torres Strait , which lies between the far north - eastern tip of the Australian mainland and Papua New Guinea , have witnessed similar scenes in recent years .
Houses , roads and graveyards have been flooded , and the locals believe they know the reason : climate change .

The low - lying islands that dot the sparkling waters of this region are facing similar challenges to South Pacific nations such as Kiribati and Tuvalu .
But while the plight of those countries is well known and is regularly discussed in the international arena , few people outside Australia have even heard of the Torres Strait .
Even Australians would have difficulty locating it on the map , and the remote islands – accessible only by light plane – receive few visitors .
Donna Green is one exception .
A scientist at the University of New South Wales , English - born Dr Green is educating the islanders about the possible impacts of climate change and ways in which they can adapt .
She embarked on the project after discovering that no one else was doing it .
In fact , although the Torres Strait is considered the most vulnerable area of Australia , it is barely on the radar , either as a subject of scientific research or a focus of government policy .
There is no action plan for the region , and the newly formed Department of Climate Change was unable to cite any studies relating to these northerly islands .
A search for the words " Torres Strait " on the department 's website yields no results .
Until the end of the last Ice Age , the strait was a land bridge connecting northern Australia with New Guinea .
Some islands lie only a few miles off the Papua New Guinea coast , and the locals have more in common , ethnically , with the Melanesians of Papua New Guinea than the Aborigines of the Australian mainland .
But they consider themselves proud Australians , and feel mildly aggrieved that it is not widely known that Australia has not one , but two indigenous races .
Six of the inhabited Torres islands are low - lying coral cays or swampy mud islands , with little or no elevation .
As you fly over them , they look like smudges of green in a shimmering expanse of blue .
Others are granite or volcanic , with some higher land .
Even there , though , people are accustomed to living by the beach , their days revolving around fishing and collecting shells .
At dusk , walking along the water 's edge on Murray Island , the scene is idyllic .
A local man is fishing for mackerel with his young son , as shoals of sardines dart along in the shallows .
Children play in the sand , and reggae music drifts from one of the simple houses built along the beachfront , in the shade of coconut palms and almond trees .
But , after generations of living by the sea , many locals no longer feel comfortable .
Maria Passi says : " At night I can't sleep if the tide is high . "
Her house was flooded by the king tide as well as her son's .
" There was water everywhere , and rubbish floating around , and coconuts under the bed , " says her husband Ron , as his wife adds : " When I saw how it looked , I just sat down and cried . "
Abnormally high tides are not the only phenomenon that the islanders have observed .
The seasons are shifting , and the land is eroding .
Birds ' migration patterns have altered , and the turtles and dugongs ( sea cow ) that are traditionally hunted for meat have grown scarce .
People are no longer certain when to plant their crops : cassava , yams , sugarcane , bananas , sweet potato .
Murray , home to about 400 people , is the birthplace of indigenous land rights .
It was five Murray Islanders , led by Eddie Mabo , who brought a legal action contesting the idea that Australia was uninhabited and belonged to no one when the British arrived .
After a landmark High Court decision in 1992 , Aborigines and Torres Strait islanders regained ownership of their traditional lands .
But now the land for which Mr Mabo fought so long and hard is being swallowed by the sea .
Dr Green has organised workshops on the islands , offering information and practical advice .
She has also held meetings with community elders in order to record their observations of weather patterns and environmental changes , in a project that blends traditional knowledge with Western science .
" There are very few formal records for this area , but the people who have lived here for generations have got these amazing banks of knowledge in their heads , " Dr Green says .
" If we can understand the past , through people 's memories of extreme weather events , for instance , we can make projections for the future and work out what kind of action needs to be taken .
" Some of the people I 've spoken to have already passed away .
So that knowledge of theirs , which is like a library , is already being lost and it's irreplaceable . "
Ron Day , a Murray Island elder and community leader , says he has witnessed disturbing changes .
" We see the big trees near the beach , like the wongai trees , falling down .
The seagrass that the dugongs eat , you used to find long patches of it , but not any more .
The corals are dying , and the sand is getting swept away and exposing the rock .
" We were taught by our grandfathers and fathers to read the sky and forecast the weather .
You see this cloud , you go to your garden and start planting .
You see that cloud , it 's time to clear your land .
But nowadays the weather is unpredictable . "
Others report that the rainy season is rainier , the dry season drier .
And the marine life is behaving oddly .
Julie Zaro , administration officer at the school on Murray , says : " Normally , at this time of year , you just throw out a line and get a mullet .
But I sat there all weekend and did n't see one fish .
When it 's turtle time [ the mating season ] , you usually see hundreds of them up on the beach , laying their eggs .
But this year I saw only five or six . "
The people of this area – already socially and economically marginalised – face an uncertain future .
Yet they barely figure in the Australian climate change debate , which has largely focused on the prolonged drought and its impact on farmers .
About 7,000 people live on the islands , 18 of which are inhabited .
Some want an evacuation and relocation plan ; others are determined to stay put .
They have a visceral connection with their land , and fear that their identity and culture will be extinguished if they are dispersed .
In the absence of any significant outside assistance , individuals are taking the initiative .
On Murray , some locals have built makeshift fortifications against the waves , using fallen tree trunks , beach debris , rubber tyres and concrete blocks .
Mr Day is encouraging the islanders to move to higher ground .
" We 're sea people , and the sea is in our blood , " he says .
" But living on a small island surrounded by ocean , it 's very dangerous .
We have to face facts : the water is rising . "
One of his fellow islanders , Sarie Tabo , is considering relocating .
" But it would be very hard for me , because I fish every morning and every afternoon , " he says .
" I wake up and I go to sleep with the sound of the waves .
Up on the hill , it would be a whole different way of life . "
At least he has that option .
On islands such as Saibai , there is no high land to move to .
The islanders are squeezed on to a narrow strip of ground , between the encroaching ocean and the encroaching swamp .
They have raised their houses , and sandbagged their families ' burial plots .
The sea wall gets washed away during floods .
Father Ezra Waigana , priest of St Matthias Church on Saibai , says : " We were told there 's an iceberg melting and the level of the sea is going up .
We do n't know how we will survive .
Our island is only flat , and the water seems to be taking all the land . "
There was an exodus from Saibai after a major flood in 1948 but elders of Mr Waigana 's clan decided to stay on , in the place where their ancestors are buried .
Their descendants feel it would be disrespectful to move – and some people cite God 's promise to Noah never again to flood the Earth .
Politicians from Canberra and Queensland occasionally fly into the islands and fly out .
The locals call them seagulls .
Asked whether the government is doing enough to help , Mr Day replies : " Most of the time they play deaf . "
The islanders , he says , " need to make ourselves known to people in the global village " .
Dr Green says : " It 's been said to me by some islanders that they 're very happy that the Australian government is investing in the Pacific , to help their brothers and sisters deal with the impact of climate change .
But they wonder why the government is not more strongly investing in similar communities in Australia , and they feel a bit overlooked .
" This is an area with few resources , and limited capacity to adapt , and it does seem a little forgotten at the moment .
But these problems are not in Australia 's backyard .
They are right in the front room . "

DETROIT ( Reuters )  Ford Motor Company said Thursday that it would cut production through the remainder of 2008 and said it no longer expects to meet a long - held goal of returning to profitability in 2009 .
In a statement , Ford said rising prices for commodities , particularly steel , and an accelerating consumer shift from larger trucks and sport utility vehicles would make it impossible to meet the key milestone in its turnaround efforts .
Ford ’s chief executive , Alan Mulally , said the company now expects to be “ about break - even ” in 2009 , on a pretax basis and before special items , with strong results from Europe and South America .

On a couple of occasions over the past few days , I ’ve had the pleasure of editing code with other #haskellers , using the collaborative text editor gobby .
It was quite a lot of fun , and ( somewhat surprisingly , to me at least ) rather effective .
It could stand a good chance of becoming one of my preferred methods for collaborative programming .
Except .
Except that gobby does n’t support undo !
It does n’t even have a way to go “ back in time ” to a previous version of a document ( unless you have it saved locally , of course ) .
This is , quite plainly , a huge show - stopper , and I do n’t say that just in theory : I ran into this issue head - on after only a few hours of use .
I wanted to delete a bunch of double quotes , so did a search - and - replace .
It was taking too long to click “ replace ” for each double quote character , so I clicked “ replace all ” , thinking it would only replace double quotes from the current location to the end of the file .
Well , as you can probably guess , it deleted all the double quotes everywhere in the file .
Oops .
Ten minutes of tracking down missing quotes ensued , and I do n’t even want to imagine what it would have been like without the help of the typechecker .
This was ten minutes of wasted time .
I should have been able to just hit “ undo ” and get on with life .
So , why does n’t gobby have undo ?
I looked at their bug tracker , and sure enough , this has been a requested feature since 2005 .
But it ’s never been done , since undo in a collaborative - editing context is a hard problem .
Apparently someone is sorta - kinda working on an implementation , that works in some cases …
A hard problem , eh ?
What hard problems need is good theory .
Well , gee goshums !
If only there was some sort of theory of concurrent editing …
So , the upshot of all of this is that I am seriously considering writing a gobby clone in Haskell with some sweet , sweet patch theory goodness .
( Other killer features under possible consideration : hpaste and darcs integration , a Yi frontend , integrated compilation / error annotations , chat support that does n’t suck … )
I do have a lot more thoughts on the particulars of how this might work , but I wo n’t write more about the specifics here since that ’s not really the point of this post .
The point is that although I said “ seriously considering ” , in actuality I ’m not sure exactly how serious I really am .
This would be a pretty big project , and I certainly could n’t get anywhere close to pulling it off myself .
I ’m not even sure that I understand all of what it would require ; I ’d be particularly clueless about the networking and UI stuff .
I just think that it would be pretty sweet , and a great application of Haskell ’s strengths .
Mostly at this point I ’m looking for feedback .
What do you think ?
Is this an awesome idea ?
Is it a stupid idea ?
Most importantly , would you be interested in working on it ?

The goal of the Commercial Users of Functional Programming series of workshops is " to build a community for users of functional programming languages and technology " .
The fourth workshop in the series took place in Freiburg , Germany on 4th October 2007 , co-located with the International Conference on Functional Programming .
The workshop is growing rapidly , having started in Snowbird in 2004 with 25 participants , increasing to 40 in Tallinn in 2005 and 57 in Portland in 2006 , and finally to 104 registered in 2007 .
We take this growth as evidence of a sea change in attitudes to functional programming : from being an academic pursuit , functional programming is rapidly becoming a sought - after technology with increasingly broad applications .
For the first time this year , we received more offers of presentations than would fit in the available time .
The eventual schedule included an invited talk by Xavier Leroy , eleven contributed presentations , and an energetic concluding discussion led by Don Syme .
Many of the slides for these presentations are available from the CUFP home page ( http://cufp.functionalprogramming.com).

As a visual art movement that emerged in the mid 1950s , pop art aims to emphasize the nature of things popular in our daily routine .
In pop art , most artists use mechanical means of rendering techniques that downplay the expressive hand of the artist .

As a visual art movement that emerged in the mid 1950s , pop art aims to emphasize the nature of things popular in our daily routine .
In pop art , most artists use mechanical means of rendering techniques that downplay the expressive hand of the artist .
Being an art movement , it has some expressive attributes other styles do not possess .
In pop art , a vivid manifestation of pop culture reflects in vibrant colors and busy , sometimes hardly recognizable artistic approaches .
Street culture , trash , collage , comic books , grunge , graffiti and photo montage are typical design elements that were widely used by designers and artists a few decades ago .
And since grunge found its way back and became popular again , it makes perfect sense to analyze the design elements of pop art which are similar to this artistic style .
This post presents 75 outstanding examples of classic and modern pop art .
Hopefully , you will find some inspiration for future works or at least smile when scanning the images presented below .
Please notice : pop art can be quite vibrant and not necessarily pretty — in fact , some examples show that it does n’t have to be pretty at all .

Classics of pop art
Hamilton ’s collage Just What Is It that Makes Today ’s Homes So Different , So Appealing ? ( 1956 ) is considered by some critics and historians to be the first work of Pop Art .
The piece has all the human senses cast in various modes ; the purpose of the picture was to “ provoke acute awareness of the sensory functions in an environmental situation ” .
Lichtenstein ’s most famous image is arguably Whaam ! ( 1963 ) , one of the earliest known examples of pop art , adapted a comic - book panel from a 1962 issue of DC Comics ’ All - American Men of War .
The painting depicts a fighter aircraft firing a rocket into an enemy plane , with a red - and - yellow explosion .
Another famous example is the M - Maybe Girl ( 1965 ) which has become an icon for the pop art movement .
Rauschenberg is perhaps most famous for his “ Combines ” of the 1950s , in which non-traditional materials and objects were employed in innovative combinations .
While the Combines are both painting and sculpture , Rauschenberg has also worked with photography , printmaking , paper - making , and performance .
Jean - Michel Basquiat gained popularity , first as a graffiti artist in New York City , and then as a successful 1980s - era Neo-expressionist artist .
Basquiat ’s paintings continue to influence modern day artists and command high prices .
Jasper Johns is best known for his painting Flag ( 1954 - 55 ) , which he painted after having a dream of the American flag .
His work is often described as a ‘ Neo - Dadaist ’ , as opposed to pop art , even though his subject matter often includes images and objects from popular culture .
Still , many compilations on pop art include Jasper Johns as a pop artist because of his artistic use of classical iconography .
Andy Warhol was a central figure in the pop art movement .
His early paintings show images taken from cartoons and advertisements , hand - painted with paint drips .
Those drips emulated the style of successful abstract expressionists ( such as Robert Rauschenberg ) .
Eventually , Warhol pared his image vocabulary down to the icon itself — to brand names , celebrities , dollar signs — and removed all traces of the artist ’s “ hand ” in the production of his paintings .
An artist and social activist whose work responded to the New York City street culture of the 1980s .
Haring ’s imagery has become a universally recognized visual language of the 20th century .
During the late 1950s , Peter Blake became one of the best known British pop artists .
His paintings from this time included imagery from advertisements , music hall entertainment , and wrestlers , often including collaged elements .
On the Balcony ( 1955 - 57 ) is a significant early work and still stands as one of the iconic pieces of British Pop Art , showing Blake ’s interest in combining images from pop culture with fine art .
The work , which appear to be a collage but is in fact wholly painted , shows , among other things , a boy holding Edouard Manet ’s The Balcony , badges and magazines .
It was inspired by a painting by Honoré Sharrer depicting workers holding famous paintings .
An English artist who is one of the pioneers of the Pop Art movement .
Philips ’s work ranges from oils on canvas to multi-media compositions and collages to sculptures and architecture .
His most popular painting For Men Only – Starring MM and BB ( 1961 ) is created using oil , wood and collage on canvas .
Different from other pop art artists , Tom Wesselmann specialized in found art collages .
Wesselmann started working on a series of Still Lifes , continuing the use of collage but incorporating real objects : he picked up shelves , television sets , a refrigerator wherever he happened to find them , and turned them into new assemblages .
Thiebaud is an American painter whose most famous works are of cakes , pastries , boots , toilets , toys and lipsticks .
He is associated with the Pop art movement because of his interest in objects of mass culture , however , his works , executed during the 50s and 60s , slightly predate the works of the classic pop artists .
Thiebaud uses heavy pigment and exaggerated colors to depict his subjects , and the well - defined shadows characteristic of advertisements are almost always included in his work .
David Hockney is best known from his swimming pool paintings from 1967 - 1968 ( below : A Bigger Splash ( 1967 ) ) .
An important contributor to the Pop art movement of the 1960s , he is considered one of the most influential British artists of the twentieth century .
Robert Indiana was using distinctive imagery drawing on commercial art approaches blended with existentialism , that gradually moved toward what Indiana calls “ sculptural poems ” .
Indiana ’s work often consists of bold , simple , iconic images , especially numbers and short words like “ EAT ” , “ HUG ” , and “ LOVE ” .
One of the best known works by Indiana is Love Rising ( 1968 ) displayed below .
Showcase of modern pop art artists
Kevin Cherry ’s collages resembles the work of the artists of the 60s , however , it is often taken to the next level as digital art is often also embedded in his work .

How you deal with a rampaging five - hundred - foot monster in a crowded urban area ?
Now that Cloverfield has opened in the UK , it 's time for DANGER ROOM to go to the movies and consider this utterly vital question .
Back in the old days , things were fairly simple .
When * King Kong * climbed the Empire State Building , he could be taken out by a squadron of Curtiss SB2C Helldivers .
But since then there has been some inflation , and apes 20 – 45 meters tall ( Wikipedia 's estimate ) are small stuff .
The giant ants in *
Them !
* still were n't that gigantic , and the army could deal with them using poison gas and flamethrowers .
But by 1955 , when a mutated * Tarantula * the size of a skyscraper turned up , the only solution was to call the Air Force .
Bombing with high explosive had no effect – presumably the creature 's exoskeleton was too tough .
In the end napalm did the trick , setting the creature ablaze ( is chitin really flammable ? ) .
It may have helped that the pilot carrying out the strike was one Clint Eastwood , then an unknown bit - part player .
Meanwhile , The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms was menacing New York .
This was a Rhedosaurus , a type of dinosaur known only to Hollywood .
The creature was driven back by the Army , who injured it using the latest in anti-tank technology , an M20 Bazooka .
This turned out to be a mistake , as the Beast 's blood contained a vicious prehistoric germ which causes further deaths .
The only solution ( apparently ) was to fire a rifle grenade containing a radioactive material into the wound , to kill it without shedding any more blood .
The sharpshooter chosen for the mission is Corporal Stone ( " Ever use a rifle grenade ? "
" Pick my teeth with it " ) played by another unknown , a certain Lee Van Cleef .
* Cloverfield has been described as a ' reimagining ' of The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms *– both use Coney Island – but the monster is tougher to deal with , shrugging off all sorts of modern weaponry .
The reason , as I see it , is fairly simple : the kit simply is n't designed for this sort of target .
It 's difficult to make accurate assumptions about 500 foot - tall fictional monsters whose very existence violates the laws of physics .
But it 's liable to have skin , scales or other outer with protective blubber or equivalent covering several feet thick .
This will absorb anything except apart from an armor - piercing round .
Flesh , like water , can stop virtually any projectile within a few feet – that 's why you need something very exotic like a supercavitating round if you want to go through a lot of it .
Those supercavitating Russian APS underwater assault rifles might be handy here ... but you 'd need a lot of rounds to have any effect .
Anti-tank weapons probably would not do much either .
Shaped - charge HEAT warheads , like the one on the movie 's Javelin missile , produce a narrow armor - piercing jet with relatively minor behind - armour effect .
It might be enough to set off fuel or ammunition within an armored vehicle .
But against this monster , all you 're giving it is a shallow stab with a hot needle : not dangerous , just very annoying .
You could try a massive explosive blast .
David
Axe earlier suggestedthat the 21,000 lb Massive Ordnance Air Burst / Mother Of All Bombs ( MOAB ) is the weapon used at the end of the film .
He describes it as a " vacuum bomb " which is not quite correct : MOAB is not a fuel air weapon ( " Contrary to some published claims , it most certainly is not an Ethylene - Oxide Fuel - Air Explosive " say GlobalSecurity ) but has a fill of conventional H6 explosive , a mixture of RDX ( Cyclotrimethylene trinitramine ) , TNT , and aluminum .
While you might argue that it's a thermobaric weapon , the Air Force claim it is not .
This is one reason why it is less powerful than the emphatically thermobaric Russian " Father Of All Bombs " tested last year .
However , any weapon relying on blast may not do the job either .
Explosives cause three major types of injury to humans :
* Primary : Results from the impact of the over - pressurization wave with body surfaces .
* Body Part Affected : Gas filled structures are most susceptible - lungs , GI tract , and middle ear .
Types of Injuries : Blast lung ( pulmonary barotrauma ) TM rupture and middle ear damage Abdominal hemorrhage and perforation Concussion * Secondary : Results from flying debris and bomb fragments .
*
Any body part may be affected .
* Penetrating ballistic ( fragmentation ) or blunt injuries * Tertiary : Results from individuals being thrown by the blast wind .
Any body part may be affected .
A deep sea monster will not have any of the air - filled organs possessed by humans .
So the primary blast damage is likely to be minimal ( maybe a swim bladder ... maybe not ) .
No blown ear - drums or collapsed lungs .
Secondary damage from debris will also be negligible , unless you deliberately set up the geometry of the attack so that a nearby building is converted into shrapnel which strikes the beast .
As for tertiary damage … well , a 100,000 ton monster is not going to be thrown too far .
In fact , the best you 're likely to do is cause some Mild Traumatic Brain Injury , which is increasingly recognized as an effect of explosions .
This might not be a good idea .
I suspect that the best bet would be a weapon capable of producing a large explosion inside the beast – a bunker - busting bomb like the BLU - 122 used in the Divine Thunderbolt test or the even bigger Massive Ordnance Penetrator , which is still in the pipeline .
This has the added advantage that it keep collateral damage in the neighborhood to a minimum as most of the destruction should be internal .
Whether they could hit a moving target is , however , another matter .
One other category of weapons deserves mention .
These are some are specifically designed to kill very large , heavily - armored targets which may be moving at speed .
Unlike the Army and Air Force , the Navy has been in the business of dealing with this type of threat for a century , and the type of missile designed to home in on and destroy a warship is quite well suited to monster mashing .
In this regard , the otherwise ghastly 1998 US remake of Godzilla deserves an honorary mention : when New York is faced with a giant monster , the call for F / A - 18s armed with AGM - 84 Harpoon missiles .
While the 488 lb warhead might seem a bit small , it should get through the skin of most city - wrecking beasts , and if you use enough of them you should get somewhere .
Then again , maybe we need something else to meet this kind of threat .
Perhaps we need to bring back battleships with 16 " guns – these would certainly give most monsters something to think about and should be able to save New York ( apologies to the inhabitants of Denver , you 're not well located for naval gunfire support – but you 're not at such high risk from mosnters anyway ) .
Perhaps Lockheed , Boeing and Raytheon – or our readers – could make some suggestions ?

Revision3 , the Internet television network behind popular shows like Diggnation , experienced a serious network failure over Memorial Day weekend .
CEO Jim Louderback revealed today that the outage was caused by a massive denial of service attack that he says was perpetrated by MediaDefender , a file - sharing mitigation firm that gets paid by Big Content to disrupt peer - to - peer networks .
A SYN flood aimed at Revision3's BitTorrent tracker clogged the company 's tubes and brought down all of its web services .
The traffic logs indicated that the network was getting slammed by over 8,000 packets every second .
Revision3 tracked the source of the packets and discovered that the attack originated from MediaDefender , at which point Louderback confronted the company 's executives .
ArtistDirect CEO
Dimitri Villard and MediaDefender vice president Ben Grodsky admitted to Louderback that they had been exploiting the lax security configuration of Revision3's BitTorrent tracker and using it to conduct decoying operations , but they disavowed knowledge of the denial of service attack and claimed that their servers were only pinging Revision3 once every three hours .
P2P poisoning
As we explained last year in our detailed examination of MediaDefender 's peer - to - peer poisoning tactics , MediaDefender often serves and vigorously propagates fake or damaged files that are labeled in a manner that makes them appear to be commercial content .
MediaDefender attempts to push its faked files to the top of popular search engines so that when pirates are attempting to illegally obtain content produced by one of MediaDefender 's customers , downloaders will get MediaDefender 's broken files instead .
This tactic is referred to as " decoying . "
MediaDefender was likely using the backdoor in Revision3 's tracker so they could propagate decoy torrent files for third - party commercial content .
MediaDefender also uses denial of service attacks to flood out servers that are distributing copyrighted material without authorization — a tactic that it refers to as " interdiction . "
The goal of an interdiction operation is to temporarily impede propagation of new releases so that filesharers will be compelled to use legitimate commercial distribution channels .
MediaDefender has an extremely powerful network infrastructure — consisting of a 9GBps dedicated line and an array of over 2,000 servers — that it uses for spoofing and interdictions .
Louderback notes that his company had recently increased security on its tracker .
He believes that MediaDefender 's network automatically launched the SYN flood in retaliation when it could no longer exploit Revision3 for its decoying distribution purposes .
" Although I can only guess , here 's what I think really happened .
Media Defender was abusing one of Revision3 's servers for their own purposes — quite without our approval .
When we closed off their backdoor access , MediaDefender 's servers freaked out , and went into attack mode — much like how a petulant toddler will throw an epic tantrum if you take away an ill - gotten Oreo , " Louderback wrote in a blog entry .
" That tantrum threw upwards of 8,000 SYN packets a second at our servers .
And that was enough to bring down both our public - facing site , our RSS server , and even our internal corporate e-mail — basically the entire Revision3 business . "
Bringing in the FBI
MediaDefender attempted to assure Louderback that steps would be taken to prevent a repeat of the incident , but he is n't impressed .
He says that the FBI is investigating the matter and points out that denial of service attacks fall afoul of the Economic Espionage Act and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.
MediaDefender could be in serious trouble for its latest antics .
We attempted to contact MediaDefender to get their perspective on the situation with Revision3 , but the company has not yet responded to our request for comment .
This is n't the first time that MediaDefender has faced scrutiny .
The company was accused of perpetrating an entrapment scheme last year when it was discovered that MediaDefender was behind MiiVi , a web site that offered full - length movie downloads .
MediaDefender vigorously denied the allegations and told Ars that the site was an internal experiment that was never intended to be made public .
MediaDefender found itself uncomfortably under the microscope again last year when hundreds of megabytes of internal company e-mail were leaked to the public by an anti-MediaDefender group that had intercepted the messages .
The information disclosed through the leak revealed that MediaDefender had lied about its activities with MiiVi and was even planning on resurrecting the scheme .
MediaDefender retaliated against the leakers by launching an interdiction attack against their web site , but ultimately failed to prevent the e-mails from spreading .
BitTorrent is increasingly being used for legitimate media distribution by all sorts of content creators ranging from innovative startups to major companies .
MediaDefender 's indiscriminate abuse of torrent trackers threatens to damage businesses that use BitTorrent legally .
" If it can happen to Revision3 , it could happen to your business too , " Louderback ominously proclaims .
Indeed , MediaDefender 's aggressive practices threaten to hurt companies that legally use newer content - distribution business models .

Ana Puente was an infant with a liver disorder when her aunt brought her illegally to the U.S. to seek medical care .
She underwent two liver transplants at UCLA Medical Center as a child in 1989 and a third in 1998 , each paid for by the state .
But when Puente turned 21 last June , she aged out of her state - funded health insurance and was unable to continue treatment at UCLA .
This year , her liver began failing again and she was hospitalized at County - USC Medical Center .
In her Medi-Cal application , a USC doctor wrote , “ Her current clinical course is irreversible , progressive and will lead to death without another liver transplant . ”
The application was denied .
The county gave her medication but does not have the resources to perform transplants .
Advertisement
Late last month Puente learned of another , little - known option for patients with certain healthcare needs .
If she notified U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services that she was in the country illegally , state health officials might grant her full Medi-Cal coverage .
Puente did so , her benefits were restored and she is now awaiting a fourth transplant at UCLA .
Puente ’s case highlights two controversial issues : Should illegal immigrants receive liver transplants in the U.S. and should taxpayers pick up the cost ?
The average cost of a liver transplant and first - year follow - up is nearly $ 490,000 , and anti-rejection medications can run more than $ 30,000 annually , according to the United Network for Organ Sharing , which oversees transplantation nationwide .
Donor livers are also in scarce supply .
In California , nearly 3,700 people are on a waiting list for livers , according to the network .
Last year , 767 liver transplants were performed in the state .
More than 90 % of the organs were given to U.S. citizens .
Advertisement
Donor livers are generally allocated through a geographically based distribution system on the basis of how sick the patients are and how long they have been on the transplant waiting list .
Immigration status does not play a role in allocating organs .
But some say that it should and that illegal immigrants should return to their home countries for care rather than receive organs and costly transplants ahead of legal residents and U.S. citizens .
“ All transplants are about rationing , ” said Roy Beck , executive director of NumbersUSA , which favors stricter controls on immigration .
“ I just do n’t think the public ought to be funding any kind of benefits for people who are breaking the law . ”
Advertisement
Larry Gonzalez , a U.S. citizen who has hepatitis C , has known for a decade that he needs a new liver but was just placed on the transplant waiting list last week .
“ Why do we have to get in line behind immigrants , foreigners , when we have enough people here to fill the hospitals ? ” asked Gonzalez , 54 , who lives in Ventura .
“ It just seems obvious to me that we should n’t be taking a back seat . ”
But Dr. Michael Shapiro , vice chairman of the ethics committee for the organ network , said illegal immigrants have just as much right to organ transplants as U.S. citizens .
He said it is likely that more illegal immigrants donate organs than receive them .
“ People are people , and when you make an incision in an organ donor , you do n’t find little American flags planted on their organs , ” Shapiro said .

Holes in the safety net
Illegal immigrant children with certain severe , chronic illnesses are eligible for funding under a state program called California Children ’s Services .
But the coverage ends when they turn 21 .
After that , they can receive free or low - cost treatment through county services for the medically indigent and , in some cases , emergency Medi-Cal .
But in Los Angeles County , doctors said neither program covers liver transplants .
State health officials said California law is designed so there is no gap in coverage , so children move seamlessly from state - funded treatment to county care .
But that does n’t always happen .
When they become adults , patients like Puente often have to switch doctors and hospitals and may lose access to necessary care .
“ Certainly it ’s not the ideal , ” said Stan Rosenstein , chief deputy director of healthcare programs at the California Department of Health Care Services .
“ We are strong believers in continuity of care , so it is concerning when you have a break in coverage . ”
Advertisement
That break can be life - threatening for people like Puente .
“ It does n’t matter if I ’m undocumented , ” she said .
“ They should take care of me at UCLA for the rest of my life because I ’ve been there since I was a baby . ”
Puente , who lives in Van Nuys , was transferred from County - USC back to UCLA this month after getting approved for Medi-Cal .
If illegal immigrants inform the state in writing that U.S. immigration services “ is aware of their presence and does not plan to deport them , ” they could be eligible for full - scope Medi-Cal , said Norman Williams , spokesman for the state health department .
Medical condition is one factor that would make immigrants eligible for coverage .
The immigrants send a form to Citizenship and Immigration Services , but the agency said it does not respond to patients or make any promises about their immigration status .

Looking to the future
Dr. Sue V. McDiarmid , medical director of UCLA ’s pediatric liver transplant program , said that she regrets not being able to continue treatment for every patient but that it would not be “ financially responsible ” to waive all fees .
She said the university does follow up with its patients once they are under county care .
“ It is just not our philosophy to dump patients , ” McDiarmid said .
“ When things go wrong , it truly is a heartbreaker . ”
But she said liver transplantation is more than a surgical procedure ; doctors have to consider whether the patient will have access to healthcare and medication in the long run .
Advertisement
“ If we felt at any time that we were transplanting a liver into a person that the hope of any long - term outcome was very poor , we should n’t be doing the transplant , ” she said .
McDiarmid said , however , that doctors do not ask about a patient ’s immigration status .
The larger problem , she said , is that the state healthcare system cuts off illegal immigrants who were covered as children .
“ We took care of those undocumented children because we thought , and the state thought , that it was the right thing to do , ” she said .
“ Why would we as a society then turn our backs on them ? ”
Puente is not the only young transplant patient who has shown up for county care recently .
Dr. Andrew Stolz , who directs the liver consultation service at County - USC as well as the county ’s outpatient Roybal Liver Clinic , said the facility is treating about 10 liver transplant patients who aged out of California Children ’s Services and no longer have insurance .
Advertisement
Though he does not know how many of these patients are immigrants , Stolz said those who are here legally could apply for full - scope Medi-Cal to cover a liver transplant .
Repeat transplants , which are not uncommon , can be necessary if the patients ’ bodies reject the livers at the time of the transplant or while they are on medication , or if the transplant livers develop hepatitis C , Stolz said .
Jose Lopez said he came to the U.S. with his mother illegally as a child .
Soon after , he contracted hepatitis A and received his first liver transplant .
Eight years later , he got cirrhosis and received another transplant .
Both were performed at UCLA and paid for by the state .
Advertisement
As his 21st birthday approached , his mother , Maria Elena Lopez , searched for clinics that might agree to treat her son .
She applied for Medi-Cal for him but has not received a response .
Her son turned 21 on Aug .
7 . He said the UCLA doctors gave him extra medications to hold him over .
About a month later , his mother found the Roybal clinic , which provided Lopez with medication and monitored his care .
Though his drugs never lapsed , his liver is still in rejection .
“ I ’m just mad , ” he said from the Los Angeles apartment he shares with his parents .
“ You ca n’t just leave a person to die .
That ’s pretty much what they ’re telling me : ‘ You ’re illegally here .
We ’re just gonna let you die . ’ ”
Advertisement
He said he does n’t blame UCLA for not wanting to treat him free , but added , “ I was hoping for some miracle . ”
Lopez just learned about the relief Puente received and said he may follow the same route .
He hopes to return to UCLA for treatment .
A question of ethics
Medical ethicists said doctors and hospitals have a duty to continue treatment for their transplant patients unless they can find them comparable care elsewhere .
Advertisement
“ The worst ethical violation a physician can commit is abandonment , ” Arthur Caplan , chairman of the department of medical ethics at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine , wrote in an e-mail .
“ Physicians and institutions do have a duty to these patients once they transplanted them .
. . .
Insurance running out is no excuse for abandoning them . ”
Caplan said UCLA doctors were under no obligation to perform liver transplants on the illegal immigrant children knowing that their insurance would run out at 21 and that their livers would probably need to be replaced .
Wesley Ford , director of children ’s medical services for Los Angeles County , said his office works with patients before their 21st birthdays to make sure they are covered .
But that is more difficult for illegal immigrants .
“ It ’s not that we want to deny care to these kids , ” he said .
“ It ’s required by state law that we discontinue care at age 21 . ”
Advertisement
Los Angeles County picks up where the state left off , providing costly medications , performing lab work and conducting biopsies -- regardless of immigration status .
But the key for patients who lose their insurance at 21 , Stolz said , is to go immediately to the county before any lapse in medicine occurs and before their livers fail .
“ We would hate for patients to lose a liver because they ca n’t get medication , ” Stolz said .
“ A lot of people just are not aware that there is this safety net . ”

Visualisation of avalanche effect .
Credit : TU Delft
Researchers at TU Delft ( Netherlands ) and the FOM Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter have found irrefutable proof that the so - called avalanche effect by electrons occurs in specific , very small semiconducting crystals .
This physical effect could pave the way for cheap , high - output solar cells .
The findings are to be published in scientific journal Nano Letters this week .
Solar cells provide great opportunities for future large - scale electricity generation .
However , there are currently significant limitations , such as the relatively low output of most solar cells ( typically fifteen percent ) and high manufacturing costs .
One possible improvement could derive from a new type of solar cell made of semiconducting nanocrystals ( crystals with dimensions in the nanometre size range ) .
In conventional solar cells , one photon ( light particle ) can release precisely one electron .
The creation of these free electrons ensures that the solar cell works and can provide power .
The more electrons released , the higher the output of the solar cell .
In some semiconducting nanocrystals , however , one photon can release two or three electrons , hence the term avalanche effect .
This could theoretically lead to a maximum output of 44 percent in a solar cell comprising the correct semiconducting nanocrystals .
Moreover , these solar cells can be manufactured relatively cheaply .
The avalanche effect was first measured by researchers at the Los Alamos National Laboratories in 2004 .
Since then , the scientific world has raised doubts about the value of these measurements .
Does the avalanche effect really exist or not ?
Within the Joint Solar Programme TU Delft ’s Prof. Laurens Siebbeles has now demonstrated that the avalanche effect does indeed occur in lead selenide ( PbSe ) nanocrystals .
It has been established , however , that the effect in this material is smaller than previously assumed .
Siebbeles ’ results are more reliable than those of other scientists thanks to more careful and more detailed measurement using ultra - fast laser methods .
Siebbeles believes that this research paves the way for further unravelling the secrets of the avalanche effect .

The Air Force Academy was criticized by Muslim and religious freedom organizations for playing host on Wednesday to three speakers who critics say are evangelical Christians falsely claiming to be former Muslim terrorists .
The three men were invited as part of a weeklong conference on terrorism organized by cadets at the academy ’s Colorado Springs campus under the auspices of the political science department .
The three will be paid a total of $ 13,000 for their appearance , some of it from private donors , said Maj .
Brett Ashworth , a spokesman for the academy .
The three were invited because “ they offered a unique perspective from inside terrorism , ” Major Ashworth said .
The conference is to result in a report on methods to combat terrorism that will be sent to the Pentagon , members of Congress and other influential officials , he added .
Llandeilo was the first in Wales to become a Transition town A number of west Wales towns are looking to launch their own currency in a bid to boost local businesses .
The idea has come from the Transition Towns movement , which aims to make towns self - sustaining , to encourage people to spend their money locally .
Backers are hoping to start in the scheme in Llandeilo , Llandovery and Lampeter .
The currency could only be used in participating businesses which would continue to use sterling as well .
Llandeilo became Wales 's first transition town last year although others have since joined .
Local currency schemes are already running in other communities including Totnes in Devon and in America with Lampeter the first planned in Wales .
The idea is a sound one and it's been working well in other communities
Rhiannon Rowley Rhiannon Rowley of Transition Towns Llandeilo said : " There 's a serious side to something that may look quirky .
" What we are seeking to do is relocalise and a local currency is an extremely good way of doing it . "
She said the plans were very much in their early stages but they hoped to launch before the end of the year .
A set amount of local currency would be printed - which would have a value to linked to sterling .
Businesses would be encouraged to sign up to accept it and display window stickers where it could be spent .
The scheme in Totnes in Devon was expanded last year following what organisers say was a successful pilot .
" The idea is a sound one and it 's been working well in other communities so there is no reason why it wo n't in these towns in Wales , " added Ms Rowley .
The transition towns movement was set - up to make communities self - sustaining in response to climate change and rising oil prices .
Shopping locally is quite fashionable thing to do
Helen Humprhys , Llandeilo clothes shop owner
They focus on sustainability through renewable energy , allotments , farming and local businesses .
" We are a group of like minded communities across Wales and across the rest of the UK , " added Ms Rowley .
" It 's developing differently in different areas - it 's a real grass roots movement . "
Joy Daniel , an assistant at a Llandeilo delicatessen , said : " It sounds a bit complicated but OK in principle .
' Old fashioned ' " It would need a lot of work in the consultation - we'd want to know how it 's worked elsewhere and what the feedback is from other people .
" All traders will have to be involved in the consultation . "
Helen Humprhys , clothes shop owner and joint secretary of Llandeilo chamber of trade said it would rely on all shops and businesses taking part but it had appeal .
" Shopping locally is quite fashionable thing to do , " she said .
" Doing something that 's taking us back to our roots , being more organic and helping each other out is old fashioned and a lovely way of living . "

Three people were walking on the road , and they saw a man standing on a hill .
" I wonder what that man is doing , " one of them said , " perhaps he is waiting for someone . "
" I 'll bet he 's looking for a cow that has strayed , " said another .
" Or perhaps he is just enjoying the breeze , " said the third .
So the three people went up the hill to the man , to find out .
" We 're just curious , " they said , " are you waiting for someone ?
Or are you perhaps looking for a cow that has strayed ?
Or are you just enjoying the breeze ? "
" None of those , " said the man .

When anyone asked the boy what his master had preached about , the boy would raise his finger .
Gutei heard about the boy 's mischief .
He seized him and cut off his finger .
The boy cried and ran away .
What is the sound of two hands clapping ?
The Bodhisattvas are great tricksters , Sacrificing their own purity to save all sentient beings .
But their words only cloud the glass .
Better they had kept their mouths closed .
Mind , body , feelings , and phenomena are empty .
Yet undeniably Angelina Jolie is hot .
When you can comprehend the emptiness of mind , body , and feeling , and the hotness of Angeline Jolie , Then the ten thousand things will pass through the gate .
Apple - Holding Zen
At a retreat in a mountain monastery run on the principles of shikantaza , one student was particularly sharp in his questioning of the roshi .
" You talk so much about sitting , " the student said , " and how we just sit , and just sitting is all that matters , and is the expression of perfection and enlightenment and all .
But why sitting ?
What is so special about sitting ?
Why do we just sit , instead of , I do n't know , just holding an apple or something ? "
The roshi took an apple from the bowl at his side and threw it at the questioner .
Instinctively , the student put out his hand and caught it .
At the slap of the apple against his palm , the student was enlightened .
Or at least he shut up for awhile .
One afternoon a student said " Roshi , I do n't really understand what 's going on .
I mean , we sit in zazen and we gassho to each other and everything , and Felicia got enlightened when the bottom fell out of her water - bucket , and Todd got enlightened when you popped him one with your staff , and people work on koans and get enlightened , but I 've been doing this for two years now , and the koans do n't make any sense , and I do n't feel enlightened at all !
Can you just tell me what 's going on ? "
" Well you see , " Roshi replied , " for most people , and especially for most educated people like you and I , what we perceive and experience is heavily mediated , through language and concepts that are deeply ingrained in our ways of thinking and feeling .
Our objective here is to induce in ourselves and in each other a psychological state that involves the unmediated experience of the world , because we believe that that state has certain desirable properties .
It 's impossible in general to reach that state through any particular form or method , since forms and methods are themselves examples of the mediators that we are trying to avoid .
So we employ a variety of ad hoc means , some linguistic like koans and some non-linguistic like zazen , in hopes that for any given student one or more of our methods will , in whatever way , engender the condition of non-mediated experience that is our goal .
And since even thinking in terms of mediators and goals tends to reinforce our undesirable dependency on concepts , we actively discourage exactly this kind of analytical discourse . "
And the student was enlightened .
Not Dualistic
Three Zen students came out of a Dharma talk .
" What did you think of Roshi 's talk today ? " one of them asked .
" When he talked about true and false practice , I thought that was kind of dualistic , was n't it ? "
" Ah , " said the second , " but your even saying that is dualistic itself , do n't you see ? "
" Look who 's talking , " said the third .
" I 'm glad I 'm not dualistic like you guys ! "
The Core of the Teachings
We were enclosed in a wall made of one thousand wooden planks .
One day our Teacher walked over , tore loose the 637th plank , and used it to smash down the wall .
Then he went to lunch .
We were amazed !
We took the 637th plank and stood it back up on end .
" The 637th plank is the core of the Teachings ! " , we said , and we looked upon it in wonder and awe .
Now some of us are saying " No , no , it 's not the plank itself that 's important , it 's the way that the Teacher held it .
The Grip is the core of the Teachings ! " .
But the Teacher is still at lunch , so we can't ask him .
Zen students are with their masters at least ten years before they presume to teach others .
Nan-in was visited by Tenno , who , having passed his apprenticeship , had become a teacher .
The day happened to be rainy , so Tenno wore wooden clogs and carried an umbrella .
After greeting him Nan- in remarked : " I suppose you left your wooden clogs in the vestibule .
I want to know if your umbrella is on the right or left side of the clogs . "
" Beats the hell out of me , " Tenno replied without hesitation .
" Ah , " said Nan-in , " Have some tea . "
" Word , " replied Tenno .
There was once a wise and venerated fish who preached about water .
Water , he would say , surrounds and supports us .
We are all in and of the water , and where there is nothing else there is water .
Fish came from all over the ocean to hear him teach .
' I have nothing to teach , ' he said , ' only enjoy the water , ' but they came anyway , and some of them began to understand the water , and some of them came to understand it fully , and were called awakened .
One day a fish came and said ' Teach me of the water ' .
The teacher said ' I have nothing to teach .
The water is all around us , above and below , and it fills the spaces where nothing else is . '
The fish frowned thoughtfully .
' You mean this stuff ? ' he asked , and flicked a fin so that a wave of water lightly struck the teacher 's face .
' Yes , ' said the teacher , bowing his head and smiling in acknowledgement ' that is the water ; I see you have attainment . '
' Oh , ' said the fish , surprised , ' that 's it ? '
' That 's it . '
' Oh , okay , ' said the fish , ' nice weather we 're having , eh ? ' "
We live surrounded by hills and trees and lakes and walls and sofas , and our great mistake is in thinking " We live surrounded by hills and trees and lakes and walls and sofas " .
Before my initiation , walls were walls and sofas were sofas .
When I was learning the truth , walls were no longer walls , and sofas were no longer sofas .
But now I am enlightened , walls are once more walls , and sofas are once more sofas .
One day Will Rogers was talking to a Zen student at the boundary between the monastery and the Wild West .
Each was leaning against the fence from his own side , and they were talking about things .
After awhile the Zen student , impressed with the humor and deep humanity he sensed in Will Rogers , said " I think you 're not far from Buddahood " .
And Will Rogers replied , " Yep , just the fence here between us . "
May 6 , 2008  -- FBI agents raided the downtown Washington , D.C. offices of Special Counsel Scott Bloch Tuesday , a spokesman for the official confirmed .
The Office of Special Counsel ( OSC ) was created to protect whistle - blower rights and investigate improper political activity by government employees .
Bloch allegedly attempted to destroy certain computer files in his office following complaints by whistleblowers in his own office .
President Bush appointed Bloch to head the office in 2003 .
" We are cooperating with law enforcement , " said OSC spokesman Jim Mitchell by e-mail .
" We do not know what this is about .
Meanwhile , we are continuing to perform the independent mission of this office . "
The National Public Radio and Wall Street Journal , which first reported the raid , said the searches appeared related to allegations of obstruction of justice by Bloch during a 2006 inquiry into his office .
Bloch told the Federal Times he hired the firm Geeks on Call to fix a problem with his laptop computer that IT was unable to solve .
He said the firm was hired to protect sensitive files , not destroy them .
The data wipe " was Fixing Problems 101 , " Bloch told Federal Times in an interview .
" End of story . "
In recent years , Bloch and the administration formed something of a mutual investigation club .
The White House directed the Office of Personnel Management to investigate Bloch in 2005 , reportedly over allegations he retaliated against his subordinates and improperly dismissed certain whistle - blower cases .
In 2007 , Bloch opened a sprawling investigation into the White House .
It covered questions on whether top political operative Karl Rove and others improperly dispatched favors from government agencies to help Republicans win in the 2006 midterm elections , the firing of U.S. Attorney David Iglesias and the White House e-mail system .
A grand jury approved subpoenas for Tuesday 's raids on Bloch 's office and home , indicating he is the subject of a federal criminal investigation .
Twenty agents participated in the search of Bloch 's office , which began at 10:30 a.m .
Bloch was not arrested , but he was reportedly interviewed by agents .
Bloch has been no darling to outside watchdog groups , who last year accused him of opening investigations into Bush administration figures as a way to claim political martyrdom if he himself was done in by a probe .
" It 's been our experience that Scott Bloch is someone who gives opportunism a bad name , " Jeff Ruch , director of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility ( PEER ) , told ABC News last year .
In the past , Ruch and other groups have called on Bloch to resign .
Through a spokesman , Bloch had denied any suggestion his investigations were motivated by self - preservation .
Bloch 's investigations have helped nudge other top government officials from their perches .
Last May , Bloch concluded that former Government Services Administration head Lurita Doan , who resigned recently , was guilty of violating a ban on partisan political activity by encouraging her employees to think of ways to help " our candidates . "
Doan steadfastly maintained her innocence , and said the White House requested her resignation because she had become " a distraction . "
Last June , Department of Commerce Inspector General Johnny E. Frazier resigned after Bloch concluded that Frazier had retaliated against employees who had reported wrongdoing .
Frazier disagreed .
Upon resigning , he acknowledged he was disappointed to be " leaving ... at a time when my office and I are the subject of controversy . "

The Democratic Party is closer than it ’s ever been to a political nightmare — a deadlocked convention .
Though the odds of its actually happening are still remote , the idea is so rich with dramatic possibility that we asked Lawrence O’Donnell Jr. , former West Wing writer - producer , to play out a scenario in movie - treatment form .
The premise is that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton arrive in Denver , neither having sufficient delegates to gain the nomination nor a decisive majority in the popular vote .
And so it ’s on …
FROM THE BLACK , we hear noises , confusing sounds .
Grunting ?
Groaning ?

REVEAL hard - core gay sex scene between a flawless blond bodybuilder - hooker and a bald , middle - aged 300 - pound man .
A cell phone rings .
The fat man reaches for it , hits a button to stop the ringing .
Back to sex .
A hotel phone starts ringing .
And ringing .
And ringing .
The fat man picks it up and hangs up to stop the ringing .
It rings again immediately .
The fat man tries the same trick .
And it rings again immediately .
Finally , the phone wins .
As the fat man talks on the phone , the hooker continues to do his job .
Fat man : Yeah … Harold , can I call you ba— …
Uh - huh … I still have n’t deci— …
This really is n’t a good time for — …
Please .
I have to — … I just — … I need — … ( Desperate to get back to sex , gives up . )
Okay …
Yes , I ’m saying yes …
No , you ca n’t announce it yet … I ’m giving you my word … I ’ve got to hang up now … Okay .
( Hangs up . )
Hooker ( looking up from his work ) :
Are you a superdelegate ?
CUT TO :
Harold Ickes hanging up the phone in his hotel suite , the Clinton delegate - counting center .
Ickes :
Hey , I just got the lieutenant governor of —
Howard Wolfson : Have you seen Gore ?
( Grabs a remote , flips on CNN ’s live coverage of Al Gore arriving at Denver airport . )
Ickes ( shocked ) : Holy shit !
Wolfson :
He ’s lost , what , 30 pounds ?
Ickes ( still ca n’t believe his eyes ) :
He looks like …
Wolfson : A fucking candidate !
CUT TO :
Al Gore passes through a hotel lobby and is swarmed by fans and delegates .
The fat man from the sex scene fights his way close to Gore .
A Gore aide whispers the fat man ’s name to Gore .
Fat man :
Hey , Al , remember me ?
I ’m the lieutenant govern —
Gore : Hey , Pete , great to see you .
Are you committed ?
Fat man :
Well , actually , I just said yes to Hillary , but if you throw your hat in the —
Gore :
Hey , I ’m just here to help any way I can .
Fat man :
You look just unbelievable .
CUT TO :
Brian Williams sets the table with his solemn intro to NBC ’s coverage :
The pledged delegate score is Obama 1,688 , Clinton 1,539 ; Obama holds a slim popular - vote lead of 1.5 percent with 30 million votes cast ; 263 superdelegates remain uncommitted .
Anything can happen .
Howard Dean opens the convention and gets booed off the stage .
The delegates hold him responsible for the mess they ’re in .
Dean grabs Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi as he rushes out of the convention hall .
Dean tells them they ’ve gotta figure out a way to stop the bleeding tonight .
Dean , Reid , and Pelosi get heckled by passing delegates as Obama Girl happily signs autographs in the background .
Midnight .
Dean ’s suite .
Party leadership meets .
Where ’s Gore ?
He said he ’d be here .
Someone points to a TV .
Gore ( on CNN ) : No , Anderson , I ’m not here as a candidate .
I ’m just trying to be helpful in any way I can .
The leadership considers going to Hillary and telling her it ’s time to drop out .
They all know there will be blood if they do that .
Someone suggests trying to get Barack to drop out .
Reid : Barack sure is a lot easier to talk to .
Pelosi :
Are we really gonna ask him to drop out just because he ’s easier to talk to ?
They screw up the courage to go to Hillary .
They all agree they have to have Gore onboard and they have to enlist at least one of Hillary ’s most committed superdelegates to join them .
Reid tries to get Chuck Schumer to join the talk - to - Hillary delegation .
Impossible .
She would see it as betrayal , pure and simple , and then Schumer could n’t possibly live with her in the Senate for the rest of their careers .
High noon .
A series of black sedans pull up to the loading dock of a hotel .
Dean gets out of one and enters the building , then Reid gets out of another , then Joe Biden , then Robert Byrd , Max Baucus , Steny Hoyer , Ed Markey , Henry Waxman — all high - profile undecided superdelegates .
Clinton suite .
The party heavyweights are gathered .
Bill Clinton , in golf clothes , kills time with them — joshing , getting them coffee — while they wait for Hillary .
Bill notices Pelosi is n’t there and is assured she ’s on the way .
Pelosi enters , with Charlie Rangel trailing .
Bill acts unsurprised .
Bill : Hey , Charlie , how ya doin ’ ?
I was wondering who they were gonna pick off from our team .
Rangel : Mr. President , this is very difficult for me .
You know I —
Bill ( dismissive ) : Sure , Charlie . ( to group ) Everyone here ?
Dean : I think we ’re waiting for one more .
Bill : Hope you do n’t mean Gore ?
Dean : Yeah .
Bill : Forget it . ( beat )
Do n’t get me wrong , I ’m not hiding him somewhere , I just know Al a bit better than you do .
I bet he ’s on TV right now .
( Grabs the remote and starts flipping channels — CNN , no .
Fox , no .
MSNBC , no .
CNBC , no .
ABC , bingo .
There ’s Gore yukking it up with Barbara and Whoopi on The View , broadcasting live from Denver . )
Look at him , working Hillary ’s demo .
You actually think Al would help y’all try to get the nomination for someone else ?
You have any idea how hard it is to lose that kinda weight ?
He did n’t do that just to go on The View .
Dean & Co. share a worried look .
Bill :
Al ’s hoping this thing goes two or three ballots , then you guys call him in from the bull pen .
( beat , icily . )
And , ’course , Al ai n’t got it in him to walk through that door and try to tell me what to do about anything .
Dean asks if Hillary is on her way .
Bill says no , change of schedule , she ’s out working superdelegates , she asked him to handle this one .
Dean nods to mild - mannered Reid , who starts in with the “ for the good of the party ” pitch .
Bill cuts him off .
Bill : Spare me the speeches .
I guess you ’re here because you already asked Barack to drop out and he turned you down ?
( Awkward silence . )
Okay , go ask Barack .
Rangel : Look , Bill —
Bill : Fuck you , Charlie .
You think you can put a knife in my wife ’s back and come in here and talk to me nicely ?
Rangel ’s 78 - year - old Harlem street instincts have him moving toward Bill with a clenched fist .
Biden jumps in to keep them apart .
Rangel :
If your wife is elected president , I ’m still gonna be chairman of Ways and Means and she ’s gonna need me every fucking day .
So how do you wanna leave it :
Fuck you , Charlie , or I ’m sorry , Mr. Chairman ?
Bill quickly apologizes , then turns to the group .
Bill : Hard being a superdelegate , huh ?
You ca n’t come right out and announce you ’re for Barack because you ’re afraid the rest of the undecideds wo n’t follow your lead .
Then where are you ?
No sense staying neutral this long if you do n’t end up picking the winner , right ?
CUT TO :
Obama suite .
Dean and the leadership are meeting with Barack and Michelle Obama .
Barack :
But I have the lead in delegates , the lead in —
Reid :
We know .
We just think a unity ticket is the only way we can —
Michelle :
Why should the guy in the lead take the VP slot ?
Reid : We —
Barack : Because you already asked Hillary to take VP and she said no ?
Dean :
We have n’t exactly asked her that yet , but if we could tell her you ’re ready to accept the vice - presidential nomination …
Barack : No .
Reid : Barack , if this goes to a second ballot , all hell could break loose .
Barack : No .
Dean ( pointing to Gore on Larry King ) :
You know Gore ’s gonna make a move if we get to a second ballot .
You really think you can hang on to all your delegates then ?
Barack shoots a worried look at Gore on TV .
Joe Biden :
You ran a strong campaign , amazing campaign , but it was n’t strong enough to win you the nomination .
I ’m sure most of your delegates love you , but conventions are about picking winners .
And if we get to a second ballot and all the delegates are free to vote for whoever is looking like a winner ( points to Gore ) , that guy ’s gonna pick off delegates from both sides and you and Hillary might end up fighting for the VP slot on a Gore ticket .
Now Michelle looks worried .
Barack and Michelle have already talked about this .
They thought they had made a decision , but this is the real decision point , and Michelle ’s supportive nod to Barack says that it ’s all up to him .
Barack : Michelle and I need the room for a minute .
Everyone scurries out of the room .
The entire leadership of the Democratic Party waits in the hotel hallway as the Obamas discuss the choice :
Go for broke or settle for VP .
Settle ?
What first - term senator has ever had the choice of settling for VP ?
What black American has ever had the choice of settling for VP ?
Michelle : I do n’t have to be First Lady .
Barack :
Tell me something I do n’t know .
Michelle : Second Lady could be fun .
Barack ( smiles ) :
We get a big house , a big plane , plenty of time to help the kids with their homework .
Michelle ( seriously ) :
And another chance to run for president .
( beat ) Your call .
Barack : Flip a coin ?
CUT TO :
Hotel hallway .
Barack opens the door to the suite , looks at Dean and the rest of the leadership anxiously waiting in the hallway .
Barack :
Gore comes after my delegates , ( beat ) he ’s gonna have to fight me for them .
Hillary ’s car is pulling away from the hotel .
She spots Oregon senator Ron Wyden getting into his car .
She has her car chase Wyden ’s car .
At a traffic light , she jumps out with a gang of Secret Service agents and they surround Wyden ’s car .
She climbs into Wyden ’s car and rides with him , working on him to vote for her .
When Wyden finally says he thinks only Obama can beat McCain , Hillary is ready for that .
She tells Wyden that McCain ’s winning the White House is the best thing that can happen for Wyden ’s reelection in 2010 , because the president ’s party always loses seats in midterm elections .
A Democratic president is going to make Wyden ’s reelection that much tougher .
CUT TO :
Ron Wyden press conference .
Wyden announces his support for Hillary , citing all the usual reasons — health care , experience , ready on day one …
Convention floor .
The roll - call vote of the states is under way .
Most of the undecided superdelegates decide not to decide until they can see which way the wind ’s blowing .
A handful of pledged delegates switch sides at the last minute , and each one immediately gets his fifteen minutes on every network .
With about 250 superdelegates staying on the sidelines , the first ballot ends with no nominee and Barack ahead of Hillary by 137 delegates .
Gore tells
Dean he wants to address the convention .
Dean : Sure , Al . No problem .
Right after you tell Hillary and Barack what a great job VP is and persuade one of them to take it .
Barack goes to the men ’s room and finds an undecided superdelegate , Ohio senator Sherrod Brown , at the urinal beside him .
Barack knows he does n’t have much time to take advantage of this situation , so he gets right to the point and offers Brown his seat on the Foreign Relations Committee when he becomes president .
Brown says he does n’t want Foreign Relations , he wants to go where the money is : Finance or Appropriations .
They both know even the president can’t help you get on those committees .
Brown zips up and leaves Barack with his dick in his hand .
Michelle runs into General Wesley Clark , who ’s having trouble getting into the convention hall because he forgot his credentials .
She has her Secret Service detail intervene to get him in .
Clearly dazzled by Michelle , Clark thanks her profusely , tells her he ’s a big fan .
Michelle jokes that she did n’t think she had a lot of fans on the Clinton campaign .
Clark ( almost apologetically ) : I ’m from Arkansas , I owe Bill Clinton a lot .
Hillary asked for my advice on military issues , so I …
Michelle spots an uncommitted superdelegate , Rhode Island senator Jack Reed , and drops Clark to chase Reed .
On the second ballot , there is surprisingly little delegate movement and no winner .
But Al Gore gets six votes , including one from the fat man , who goes with his heart this time .
With Dean still denying him the microphone , Gore does a march across the convention floor that gets him mobbed by worshipful delegates shaking his hand and getting their pictures taken with him .
Dean rushes the convention to a third ballot before Gore can build up momentum .
Hillary and Barack go to the floor and desperately work the delegates during the roll call of the states .
As they beg for votes , network camera crews are pushing through the crowds to get live close - ups of Hillary and her surrogates ( Bill , Clark , Dianne Feinstein ) and Barack and his surrogates ( Michelle , Bill Richardson , Chris Dodd ) in full suck - up mode with every delegate they talk to .
No presidential candidates have ever looked so desperate .
CLOSE ON Senate Finance Committee chairman Max Baucus sitting quietly with the Montana delegation , watching Hillary and Barack working the floor .
Baucus is disgusted by the circus the convention has become .
The third ballot is a big setback for Gore , who loses half his voters and ends up with three .
The Gore surge is over .
Delegates get friskier this time .
There are two votes for Eliot Spitzer , one for Jimmy Carter ( Carter actually has to swear to Bill O’Reilly that he did not vote for himself ) , eleven for Barney Frank , and one for Keith Olbermann .
The Frank voters happily do network interviews explaining what a joy it is to actually cast convention votes to nominate a gay man on the same night that they already cast votes to nominate a woman and a black man .
Dean finds Barack and tells him Hillary wants to meet with him one - on - one .
Barack ’s campaign guru David Axelrod says no way , she wants to offer you VP .
Michelle agrees :
Do n’t do it .
Barack turns down the meeting , then tells Dean he wants a meeting with Hillary .
Dean ’s confused :
So what is it ?
You want the meeting or you do n’t want the meeting ?
Barack : I just turned down Hillary ’s meeting .
And now I ’m inviting Hillary to my meeting .
Dean tries to pretend that what he just heard is n’t crazy .
He turns to leave .
Barack tells him to be sure to tell Hillary that he turned down her meeting before inviting her to his meeting .
Dean exits .
Axelrod :
So you offer her the VP , then —
Michelle :
She wo n’t take it .
Axelrod : I know .
Then we leak that she turned it down and —
Michelle : I got a better idea .
CUT TO :
Dean tells Hillary that Barack wants the meeting ( without mentioning that Barack turned down her meeting and that this will be his meeting ) .
Bill is shocked that Axelrod is letting Barack do the meeting .
Dean : Believe me , it was n’t easy to persuade him to do it .
Bill : Something ’s wrong with this picture .
Dean : I had to twist his arm .
I—
Bill : You ?
Twist arms ?
Bullshit . ( to Hillary ) Barack wants to offer you VP .
Dueling press conferences afterward — who offered who the VP slot .
Forget it .
It ’d be a fiasco .
The meeting ’s off .
Dean :
The meeting was your idea !
Hillary : Good - bye , Howard .
Dean exits .
Baucus finds
Dean huddling with the convention ’s parliamentarian about when to start the fourth ballot .
Baucus tells
Dean both candidates have to get in a room alone and work this out .
Dean explains what he ’s just gone through , says it ’s hopeless .
Baucus has a plan : Tell Hillary
I want to meet with her alone in this room in ten minutes to discuss endorsing her before the next ballot .
Tell Barack the same thing .
Dean says they ’ll walk out as soon as they see each other .
Baucus says :
And leave an undecided superdelegate undecided ?
I do n’t think so .
Hillary ’s Secret Service bubble moves through the hallways of the convention hall , with her inside it .
Barack ’s flying wedge of Secret Service agents moves him off the convention floor toward the Baucus meeting .
The Sharks and the Jets arrive at the holding room at the same time .
Holy shit !
Hillary and Barack both turn to leave , then Hillary turns back , thinking she can now go in there alone and get the Baucus endorsement .
Then Barack turns back .
They both turn away again and both turn back again .
There ’s an uncommitted superdelegate on the other side of that door .
Neither candidate can let the other go in that room alone .
They both enter , Barack holding the door for Hillary .
Barack ( deferentially ) : Mr. Chairman .
Baucus :
Thanks for coming .
Hillary : Max , I thought —
Baucus :
It ’s time for you two to work this out .
Baucus starts to leave .
Hillary follows Baucus toward the door , then Barack follows Hillary .
Baucus herds them back into the room .
Baucus : Listen up .
Your health - care bill ( shifts glance from one to the other ) has to come through my committee .
So does your tax bill , the changes you wanna make to NAFTA — I could go on and on .
You walk out of here now , and one of you somehow makes it to the White House , I guarantee you you ’re gonna have the worst first year ever .
( Exits . )
Barack :
Well , here we are … Hillary , I —
Hillary :
You ’re a better speaker than I am .
Barack ( confused ) : Uh …
Hillary : Way better .
Better than Bill .
Best I ’ve ever seen .
Barack : Uh , thank —
Hillary :
When you go out there and accept the nomination , it ’s gonna be the best speech of this convention , no question about it .
( beat )
Even if you ’re accepting the nomination for vice - president .
You ’re gonna be the rock star on the ticket no matter what I do .
Barack : I do n’t want to be VP .
Hillary :
The way we ’re going , you probably wo n’t have to be .
McCain ’s ahead of both of us in the polls now .
If we lose , you ’re the front - runner for the nomination to run against McCain four years from now , and you know that would be an impossible race to lose .
Barack :
If we win —
Hillary :
You ’re the front - runner for the nomination eight years from now , when you ’re what ?
Fifty - four ?
And you ’ve got VP experience to run on .
Barack : Lotta good that did Al Gore .
Hillary : Look , if you run at the top of the ticket and lose to McCain , that ’s it .
End of story .
You will never have another chance .
Ask John Kerry how easy it is to get the nomination again .
Barack :
So , I ’d be your VP and Bill would be what ?
Your executive vice - president ?
Hillary : Do n’t worry about Bill .
Barack : I ’d worry about him a lot less if he was my VP ’s husband .
Hillary : I do n’t want to be VP .
Barack :
Been there , done that ?
Hillary : Kinda , yeah .
And I learned a lot .
Barack smiles — here we go with the Hillary ’s - experience bullshit .
Hillary : Talk to Al Gore about what he learned as VP .
Barack : I think he learned it ’s a dead end .
Hillary : You do n’t —
Barack : Hillary , I care about two things exactly as much as you do : the party and getting the nomination .
Hillary :
You mean you do n’t give a shit about the party and you ’d kill to get the nomination ?
Barack ( smiles ) :
You wearing a wire ?
( beat )
You know , all that ugly ink you ’ve been getting all summer about destroying the party , handing the election to McCain — there ’s only one person who can make that go away .
Me .
That brilliant acceptance speech you ’re expecting me to give can put you back where you belong — hero of the Democratic Party — can put your husband back where he belongs — respected statesman .
Nothing else can .
Hillary : Winning can .
Barack :
If you got the nomination , you ’d lose to McCain and the Clintons become the official destroyers of the Democratic Party .
End of story .
Have fun in the Senate after that .
Hillary : C’mon , I can beat McCain .
I can —
Barack : Hillary , your negative is at 49 percent .
You have the highest negative of anyone who ’s ever run .
You cannot possibly win in November .
Hillary : The Republicans would drive up your negative if you got the nomination .
Barack :
Sure they will .
Five points ?
Push me up to 38 percent ?
What if they push your negative up two points ?
Fifty - one percent ?
It ’s hopeless , Hillary .
Hillary :
Well , let ’s see what happens on the next ballot .
Hillary turns to leave .
Barack : I do n’t care how many ballots you want to put us through .
I do n’t care if this convention takes two weeks .
I came here to win , and that ’s what I ’m going to do .
Nothing will make me back down .
Nothing will make me take the number - two spot .
Nothing .
You ’re up against someone who is prepared to do as much damage as you are .
( beat )
And the press is gonna blame you for all of it .
Hillary has never seen this kind of ruthlessness outside of her family .
For the first time ever , the thought flashes through her mind that this guy could maybe turn out to be a good president , maybe he could stare down the Putins of the world .
Barack :
When you walk out of here I ’m going straight to a press conference and announce that when I get the nomination , my choice for VP will be Wesley Clark , and —
Hillary ( laughs ) : Not gonna happen .
Wes has been with my campaign from the start .
Barack ( continuing ) : — and on the next ballot , the possible Obama - Clark ticket ’s gonna get me the Arkansas delegation and another — what do you think — 200 superdelegates at least ?
Hillary : I ’m not gonna let you have Wes for a phony unity ticket .
Barack : Too late .
Michelle is meeting with him right now .
Barack ’s iPhone buzzes .
He checks it .
Hillary :
He wo n’t accept anything without my —
Barack holds up the iPhone .
close on text message : CLARK DEAL DONE .
LUV U , M. Hillary looks pained — as much by the Clark deal as by the love in the Obama marriage .
Barack gives her a moment to process the shock , then …
Barack ( softly ) : I want you to come with me to the press conference .
Hillary : No way .
Barack : I need —
Hillary ( bitterly ) :
You do n’t need me .
You ’ve got my biggest supporter as your VP .
He ’s got you covered now on foreign - policy credentials , military experience .
Barack :
It ’s not a unity ticket unless you say it ’s a unity ticket .
I want to tell the press that I asked you to be VP , you turned it down and suggested General Clark .
I want to give you credit for saving the day , saving the party .
I want you leaving Denver with your head held high .
Hillary : I , uh , I …
Barack :
Wes has already agreed to that story .
CLOSE on Hillary , thinking about it …
Barack : I can win the nomination without you , but I ca n’t win the election without you .
I need you , Hillary .
CUT TO :
Press conference .
CLOSE ON
Hillary smiling from ear to ear , as camera motors whir , a thousand camera flashes pop .
REVEAL she ’s holding her arms straight up in a Rocky - style victory pose .
WIDEN to reveal her left hand gripping Wes Clark ’s hand , her right hand gripping Barack ’s hand .
MOVE IN for a two - shot of Barack and Hillary as we PRE - LAP the sound of the growing roar of 20,000 people .
Hillary ( voice - over , shouting ) : I give you the next president of the United States , Barack Obama !
CUT TO :
Barack stepping up to the podium , hugging Hillary , and waving to the adoring convention crowd .
Hillary slips offstage , leaving Barack alone to soak up the standing ovation .
Hillary spots
Bill in the crowd of superdelegates at the back of the podium .
Bill is hugging Charlie Rangel and holding the hug long enough to make sure every news camera in the building gets the shot .
Repair work on the Clintons ’ relationship with black America starts now .
Hillary goes to Bill .
They hug , smile , and join in the standing ovation as if happy days really are here again .
Bill ( whispers ) : Do n’t worry .
McCain ’ll kick his ass .
FADE TO BLACK , then roll credits over still shots of cheering , crying delegates , including the fat man , and the sound of an endless standing ovation .

For a decade , Randy Scheunemann has been a campaign staffer to John McCain , an ideological ally in the fight to contain Russian power -- and a lobbyist seeking the Arizona senator 's support for former Soviet states .
Their long relationship is typical in Washington , where Sen.
McCain has served in Congress since 1983 , and it helps illustrate why the Republican presidential candidate is on the defense over ties to lobbyists .

Tom Lantos , a Democrat who has represented San Mateo in the U.S. House of Representatives for 13 terms , plans to run for reelection in 2008 .
Budapest - born Lantos , who came to the United States as a young man , may face a primary challenge from popular former state Sen. Jackie Speier .
Reports indicate that Speier , who has yet to announce her candidacy , has in - house polls showing her leading Congressman Lantos in the 12th District two to one .
Beating a politician of Lantos ’ stature would catapult Speier to immediate national standing .
One wonders why Tom Lantos has suddenly become so vulnerable .
Is Lantos , who will turn 80 early next year , beginning to show his age ?
He recently snapped at visiting Dutch parliamentarians and articulated a rather peculiar view of European history : " Europe was not as outraged by Auschwitz as by Guantanamo Bay , " and “ You have to help us [ in Afghanistan ] , because if it was not for us you would now be a province of Nazi Germany . ”
The congressman seems to have forgotten that the American liberation of the Netherlands was not an act of altruism .
The U.S. did not fight Nazi Germany because the Wehrmacht had overrun the Netherlands but because Germany declared war on the United States .
As for the Auschwitz - Guantanamo comparison , surely the congressman knows that to protest in Nazi- occupied Europe would have achieved nothing except a quick death , and , in any event , few people knew about the Auschwitz death camp until after the allies had defeated Hitler .
Twelfth District residents may be fed up with Lantos ’ support for the wars of the Bush family .
During the run-up to Gulf War I , George Bush Sr. ’s 1991 campaign to expel Saddam Hussein from Kuwait , Lantos played a key but deceitful role in convincing Congress and the American people that war was necessary .
In October 1990 , as co-chairman of the of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus , an organization masquerading as part of the U.S. government that is simply a collection of like - minded politicians , Lantos hosted a Capitol Hill meeting to hear an emotional statement from a 15 - year - old Kuwaiti nurse .
Lantos ’ witness was identified only as " Nayirah , " supposedly to protect her family from Iraqi reprisals in occupied Kuwait .
Nayirah tearfully testified that she had been a volunteer at the al - Addan hospital in Kuwait City during the Iraqi invasion and that she " saw Iraqi soldiers come into the hospital and into the room where babies were in incubators .
They took the babies out of the incubators , took the incubators , and left the babies on the cold floor to die . ”
In the three months before the start of U.S. lead military effort to drive Saddam out of Kuwait , Nayirah ’s story was told repeatedly by the president and members of Congress , in the media and at the UN , to justify war against Iraq .
Many in Congress questioned the wisdom of shedding American blood to restore the feudal and corrupt al - Sabah dynasty to power .
The resolution to use force to expel Iraqi forces from Kuwait passed the Senate 52 - 47 .
Was Nayirah ’s tale instrumental in the decision to go to war ?
We shall never know , but what we do know is the whole story was a complete and utter fabrication .
Nayirah was nowhere near Kuwait at the time of the invasion , and she is a member of the ruling al - Sabah family , the daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador to the U.S. to be precise .
" Nurse " Nayirah ’s appearance was a shameless hoax orchestrated by the Hill & Knowlton public relations firm , aided and abetted by the Congressional Human Rights Caucus .
H & K was acting on behalf of its client , Citizens for a Free Kuwait , a front for the al - Sabah family , which contributed 99 percent of its budget of $ 12 million .
Interestingly enough , Hill & Knowlton also had a close relationship with Tom Lantos and provided free office space to another of the unofficial congressional organizations Lantos chairs , the Congressional Human Rights Forum .
Did Congressman
Lantos know the throw - the babies - on - the - floor story was complete rubbish before Nayirah ’s appearance ?
Well , you decide .
Not surprisingly , Tom Lantos was also a strong supporter of the 2003 invasion of Iraq to remove Saddam Hussein from power .
Lantos even suggested an American failure to attack Saddam would be equivalent to the European appeasement of Hitler during the 1930s .
Casting Saddam the new Hitler as a way to whip up enthusiasm for regime change in Baghdad was a rhetorical device by no means limited to Lantos .
But since Lantos actually lived through World War II in Hungary , which was at first allied with the Nazis and then occupied by them , one would think he could distinguish between a third - world dictator with a fourth - class military and a world power with an industrial base and first - class military establishment .
To equate Nazi Germany with Ba’athist Iraq is the height of absurdity .
Like many members of Congress , Lantos willingly accepted flawed and fraudulent intelligence about Iraq ’s nonexistent weapons programs , even though many of the administration ’s claims were demonstrably bogus even before the war began .
And during the October 2002 debate on the resolution to authorize President Bush to invade Iraq , Lantos argued , " We can not be content to see Saddamism without Saddam .
A democratic Iraq surely would change the Middle East ’s strategic calculus , and would send a powerful message of deep hope to Arabs throughout the region living currently under all totalitarian regimes . "
While Lantos was speaking publicly about the need to bring democracy to Iraq , in private his opinion was very different .
Lantos told a visiting member of Israel ’s Knesset , Colette Avital , “ My dear Colette , you wo n’t have any problem with Saddam .
We ’ll be rid of the bastard soon enough .
And in his place we ’ll install a pro-Western dictator , who will be good for us and for you . ”
When Lantos ’ comments appeared in the Israeli newspaper Ha’aretz , he dismissed them as a “ total fabrication , ” adding , “ I am amused by the comments attributed to me , because they fly in the face of my lifetime of work .
I am a firm supporter of democracy . ”
Avital , nevertheless , stated for the record , “ I can confirm that the story is accurate .
In fact , I myself was surprised and pained by Congressman Lantos ’ comments .
Since he is a friend of Israel and I have had a long friendship with him , I did not want to react to his denial . ”
Knesset Member Avital ’s observation that Lantos is " a friend of Israel " is perhaps an understatement .
Lantos has visited Israel 68 times , making one wonder whether his constituency is in San Mateo or Tel Aviv .
Given the rumbles of discontent emanating from his constituents in the 12th District , they must be wondering the same thing .
Lantos does n’t visit his district as often as many of his supporters would like , and help for his constituents from his Washington office is said to be below par .
That Lantos has worked indefatigably throughout his congressional career to support Israel is a statement one doubts the congressman would dispute .
But do the folks in his district really know what he has been up to ?
For example , during the Hezbollah - Israeli war in the summer of 2006 Lantos co-sponsored a resolution unconditionally supporting Israel ’s military actions in Lebanon and praising Israel ’s " long - standing commitment to minimize civilian loss " and " continued efforts to prevent civilian casualties . "
These assertions could , of course , come straight out of Orwell ’s 1984 .
From Israel ’s 1982 invasion , in which 20,000 Lebanese lost their lives , to the Israeli shelling of the UN post at Qana in 1996 , in which over a hundred Lebanese civilians died in a single Israeli artillery barrage , to the 2006 summer war , Israel has never had the slightest compunction about killing Lebanese civilians .
Even as Lantos was crafting his resolution , Israel was pounding Lebanon ’s civilian infrastructure .
Before the end of the war , Israel would seed southern Lebanon ’s villages and fields with millions of cluster bomblets .
And after the cease - fire , Lantos led a campaign against U.S. aid to Lebanon earmarked for the repair of bridges , roads , airports , homes , and public buildings damaged or destroyed during the Israeli bombardment .
Lantos has spearheaded legislation against nations hostile to Israel , especially Syria and Iran , whose cooperation could be quite helpful in extracting Uncle Sam from the Iraq fiasco , a titanic mess for which Lantos is in part responsible .
His uncritical championing of a rich and powerful Israel against the weak , divided , and long - suffering Palestinians makes him look heartless .
For example , in 2003 Lantos prepared a letter , signed by most House Democrats , denouncing the so - called " Road Map " to peace as not being tough enough on the Palestinians .
In particular , he faulted the Bush administration for not demanding new Palestinian leadership and a total end to Palestinian resistance .
Lantos made no mention of the obligations the Road Map placed on Israel , most importantly suspending settlement construction , nor of any of the other measures Israel routinely takes against the Palestinians : sieges , road blocks , assassinations , curfews , and land confiscations , which all work to make the emergence of a viable Palestinian state impossible and the daily lives of the Palestinians unmitigated hell .
Other legislation Lantos has cosponsored includes an attack on the International Court of Justice for ruling that the separation wall , which juts deeply into the West Bank and cuts many Palestinian farmers off from their lands , is illegal .
Another Lantos resolution worth mentioning congratulates Israel on the 40h anniversary of the " reunification " of Jerusalem , although Jerusalem ’s Palestinian residents , who find it increasingly difficult to maintain contact with friends and family on the West Bank , hardly view the Israeli capture and continuing occupation of their neighborhoods in such a positive light .
The election of a Hamas majority to the Palestinian legislature in 2006 led Lantos to support draconian measures against the Palestinians .
The self - proclaimed champion of democracy became much less supportive of the process when the results were not to his liking .
Lantos voiced his support for a PLO coup against the democratically elected Palestinian government when he stated before his Foreign Affairs Committee , " I am very cautiously encouraged by the decision of Palestinian Authority President Abbas to put an end to the Hamas government and to install in its place a government led by former World Bank official Salaam Fayyad . "
Today as supplies of food , fuel , and medicine dwindle in Gaza , whose population of 1.4 million Israel seems intent on strangling , Tom Lantos says nothing .
Two episodes make Lantos look downright racist .
The first is Lantos ’ acceptance of the Tree of Life award from the Jewish National Fund ( JNF ) .
The JNF exists to purchase land in Israel .
When the JNF talks about reclaiming land in Israel , most people conjure up visions of swamps being drained or hillsides being planted .
Reclaiming land in JNF parlance means something entirely different ; it means administering land according to JNF rules , which preclude Muslim or Christian residents of Israel from using or occupying the land in any way .
The second is Lantos ’ refusal to reject the outrageous views of Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Avigdor Lieberman .
Lieberman has said a number of quite bizarre things .
He once called for the bombing of the Aswan High Dam to punish Egypt for supporting Yasser Arafat .
Most notoriously , Lieberman openly advocates expelling 1.2 million Palestinian citizens of Israel : " They are not wanted here .
They can take the bundles and go to Hell ! "
Although challenged to confront Lieberman , Lantos chose not to do so , an omission consistent with his unwillingness to criticize anything Israeli , least of all Israel ’s treatment of the Palestinians .
Would challenger Speier be as supportive of Israel as Lantos has been ?
Yes , but she would be unlikely to back further American adventurism in the Middle East and might push for a fair settlement of the Israel - Palestine conflict .
" Measure P is a proper legislative enactment , " Court Rules
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT :
SANTA BARBARA , CA - The American Civil Liberties Union applauded today ’s ruling by a California Superior Court judge to uphold a voter - enacted initiative that directs police to focus resources on serious crime by making marijuana use the lowest law enforcement priority .
Citing California ’s ban on lawsuits that punish public participation in the political process , the court dismissed the city of Santa Barbara ’s challenge of the law , known as Measure P , which was brought against Heather Poet because she was the proponent of the challenged initiative .
" Today ’s ruling is a major victory for the democratic process and a resounding affirmation of voters ’ right to de-prioritize marijuana enforcement , " said Adam Wolf , an attorney with the ACLU Drug Law Reform Project , which represented Poet in the proceedings .
" The people of Santa Barbara would rather local law enforcement focus on combating serious crime than policing marijuana use .
Today ’s ruling confirms that the voters can make this fundamentally local decision about their community ’s safety . "
In addition to finding that the city of Santa Barbara ’s suit against Poet arose from " her constitutional right to participate in the process of formulating laws " and ran afoul of California ’s ban on strategic lawsuits against public participation ( " SLAPP " ) , the court held that neither state nor federal law precludes localities like Santa Barbara from prioritizing the enforcement of certain criminal offenses , including the de-prioritization of marijuana offenses .
As the ruling states , " Nothing in [ Measure P ] prohibits enforcement of state law … Police officers can still arrest those who violate drug possession laws in their presence .
The voters have simply instructed them that they have higher priority work to do . "
" Santa Barbara is free to decline to enforce federal criminal statutes , " the ruling continues .
" Indeed , the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the federal government from impressing ‘ into its service - and at no cost to itself - the police officers of the 50 States . ’ "
Measure P was passed on November 7 , 2006 by over 65 percent of the electorate .
Designed to free law enforcement resources to better address violent and serious crime , Measure P makes " investigations , citations , arrests , property seizures , and prosecutions for adult marijuana offenses , where the marijuana was intended for adult personal use , the city of Santa Barbara ’s lowest law enforcement priority . "
The measure does not de-prioritize marijuana offenses related to public use or driving under the influence .
" It was terrifying to be sued by my own government , and for a fleeting moment it made me feel maybe I should n’t have gotten involved in the democratic process , " said Poet .
" But this decision proves we do have a voice and we should never be afraid to use it .
It also affirms that people in Santa Barbara , and throughout America , can protect their communities by having police focus on serious crime , rather than marijuana offenses . "
Santa Barbara is not alone in enacting its lowest law enforcement priority ordinance .
Since 2000 , at least 11 cities and counties , including seven in California , have enacted legislation treating certain marijuana offenses as a low or the lowest law enforcement priority .
Today ’s ruling , issued by Judge Thomas Anderle of the California Superior Court in Santa Barbara , is online at :

A new reason to hate Comcast Wednesday , April 16 , 2008 by Dave Winer .
As long as I 've been a customer of Comcast I 've been writing how much I wish they 'd sell their Internet business to a company that does n't hate its customers so much .
But sometimes you forget , when the service is good , you just cruise along , happy and productive .
And so I was blissfully forgetful until I read , on Twitter , that Dave Sifry was testing the bandwidth on Comcast with PowerBoost and was blown away by how great it was .
I had Comcast as a backup , rarely used it , so I hooked it up , tried it out and I got even better bandwidth than Sifry did .
Amazingly I was getting 28 megabits down , about 3 megabits up .
So I started using it on my LAN , I kept my DSL service , but I 'm not using it as much .
Then this morning around 9 AM the service went down .
I called the service number , and was quickly directed to call a special number .
I could n't record the call because I did n't have Skype working , but I wish I had found a way .
The recording said I was talking to their legal services department , Press 1 if you are stealing content , 2 if you are using too much bandwidth , 3 if Comcast hates your guts , 4 if you 're a criminal .
( I do n't remember the exact wording , this was n't it , but the implication was that I was guilty of abuse , me , a paying customer , in good standing .
By pressing a button I was admitting to doing something wrong . )
Update : Later I called the number back and recorded the opening sequence .
I was quickly connected to a man who told me I had been deliberately disconnected because they had tried to call me and I did n't pick up .
The number they called was my Blackberry , which I disconnected a couple of months ago because I never use it , I much prefer the iPhone .
Then he threatened me .
He told me I was in the top 1/10th of 1 percent of all their Internet users and that if I did n't immediately stop using so much bandwidth they would suspend my service for 12 months .
I asked if I could get this in writing , he said no .
I asked how much bandwith would be acceptable , he would n't say .
I told him this was n't much of a threat if they were n't willing to put it in writing , and I was n't intimidated .
I also told him I was a blogger and would be writing it up .
He did n't care .
Now , before I called the first number , I posted about the outage to Twitter , and sent a direct message to comcastcares , an amazing account , staffed by a guy named Frank who works at Comcast in Philadelphia , who really does seem to care .
A few days ago , Mike Arrington of TechCrunch mentioned on Twitter that his Comcast service was down , they contacted him immediately , and had a service tech at his place the next day ( I think ) .
Mike was so pleased with the service he said he'd be willing to pay double if they could keep it up .
Pretty impressive .
So I spoke with Frank on the phone after receiving the threat .
He asked me to write it up , and I am doing so here .
I also recorded a podcast with Christina Warren of Download Squad .
A bunch of ideas and questions resulted .
1 . They should have sent me a letter .
This idea of disconnecting customers to get them to call is utterly unprofessional and disrespectful and should get them in trouble with the FTC and the FCC and everyone who uses Comcast or who works at Comcast who has any self - respect .
The letter should have said something like this : " We noticed that you 're using a lot of bandwidth , and we 're happy you like the Internet so much , and like our PowerBoost service , but if you 're going to use this much bandwidth you should seriously consider getting our higher - class service , which will cost $ X more per month , but along with it you get 5 new features that only our most special customers get . "
I told Christina , there are few things I 'm so happy to spend money on as bandwidth and Internet connectivity .
It 's so easy to make it a positive instead of treating a customer as a criminal .
2 . I used AT&T DSL the same way I use Comcast and they never threatened me .
So their claims in their commercials that they 're better than AT&T are bogus .
I still love Comcast 's commericals , esp the faux news announcer and the turtles , all who ridicule AT&T but I think Comcast is dishonest , they 're selling something they do n't deliver on .
( Except PowerBoost really is awesomely fast when they have n't cut you off . )
3 . I can see where people would be very intimidated to have their service turned off and to be lectured the way they lectured me .
4 . Honestly , I think Comcast should give me my service for free and let 's work to create new services that use more bandwidth so they can sell them to customers as part of the upsell to people who use a lot of bandwidth .
5 . I figured out why I use so much more bandwidth than the average Internet user .
I have five computers , all Macs , all sucking down FlickrFan pictures once an hour .
That adds up to quite a few gigs .
It would be easy to cut back .
Not sure I will though , cause I hate to be lectured and threatened by companies I pay $ 180 per month to .
6 . The thing that amazes me , that is totally unacceptable , is that they refused to put the threat in writing .
I knew , having dealt with lawyers enough , that I had a right to receive the threat in writing , and I wanted to scan it and put it on Flickr along with my $ 3 million Comcast bill .
7 . I 've now spent all of today working for Comcast .
Should I send them a bill ?
8 . What 's the big issue with bandwidth anyway ?
Does a company like Comcast pay their ISP for bandwidth ?
Do they even have an ISP ?
Update : A plausible explanation of why they'd want to constrain bandwidth usage .

My most recent trivia on Twitter .
McCain 's Media back in action .
Did Crowley take a John McCain press release and develop this segment based on their talking points ?
This clip is from last Friday .
John McCain is in violation of the FEC 's public financing laws because he has signed up for it , has received money from it , procured a loan to help his primary and then went over the limit .
Read here for more details .
Crowley could have told you that McCain would n't have had the money to produce ads in New Hampshire to win that primary without the loan .
We might be talking about the Mitt Romney nomination right now .
And we need to look at the bank loan more closely .
The DNC has filed a complaint about it to the FEC .
Plus , Jane and the blogoshere have filed a complaint against McCain 's campaign as well with over 32,000 signatures being delivered already .
Would n't you think that we be part of her story ?
Nope .
Instead she does a hit job on Obama who made no such commitment .
Download Download
She makes sure to frame it as if Obama is waffling out of it when McCain has his hands dirty in every way .
Remember , Obama only checked a survey box , but Candy does n't tell her audience that .
I 'll repeat this again .
John McCain actually agreed to public financing when his campaign was in trouble , borrowed money to keep it going before he won the nomination and now has spent well beyond the guidelines for which he received a stern letter from the FEC's David Mason .
Obama does n't need to opt out because he never signed on .
I 'm sure McCain was giving his staff high fives over Crowley 's report .
A job well done .
Full transcript below the fold .
The Situation Room :
CANDY CROWLEY , CNN SR .
POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT : Wolf , since the system for public financing of presidential campaigns was put into place in the post - Watergate era , no major presidential campaign has ever opted out .
The question is whether this year will be the exception .
CROWLEY ( voice - over ) : Barack Obama , who has raised more than $ 230 million so far , no longer sounds like a candidate who'd take the paltry $ 84 million he'd get out of the public campaign finance system .
SEN .
BARACK OBAMA ( D - IL ) , PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE :
I think that it is creeky and needs to be reformed if it 's going to work .
CROWLEY : Public financing of campaigns was designed to take big money influence out of politics .
It 's funded by that $ 3 check box on income tax forms .
In a written survey late last year , Obama said he'd take public financing if his opponent did .
But that was before he became fundraising king .
Now he talks about how he has a kind of de facto system of his own .
OBAMA : We know that the check - off system has been declining in participation .
And as a consequence , the amount of money raised through the public financing system may be substantially lower than the amount of money that can be raised through small donations , which presents candidates then with some pretty tough decisions in terms of how they want to move forward , if they want to compete in as many states as possible .
CROWLEY : Actually , just under half of Obama 's donations came from people giving $ 200 or less .
John McCain , whose own fundraising pales in comparison to Obama 's , says he 'll take public funding , and he uses Obama 's hesitation as a campaign issue .
SEN .
JOHN MCCAIN ( R - AZ ) , PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE :
The fact is that he 's saying one thing and he 's doing the other .
I mean , that 's indisputable .
The piece of paper is there .
He did n't talk about having discussions about third parties and all that when he committed to saying that he would take public financing if the Republican nominee did .
I 'm the presumptive Republican nominee .
I will take public financing .
Keep your word to the American people .
CROWLEY : Actually , though Obama did check " yes " on that survey , he added a caveat .
" If I am the Democratic nominee , " he wrote , " I will aggressively pursue an agreement with the Republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election . "
That is a meeting Obama says he still wants to have .
CROWLEY : The McCain campaign says he is committed to taking public financing for his campaign .
Nonetheless , the door seems to be just a bit ajar in case McCain 's opponent opts out -- Wolf .
“ For the success of the world in Afghanistan , it would be better to recognize this inherent character in Afghanistan and work with it and support it , ” he said , speaking at his presidential office .
“ Eventually , if the world is to succeed in Afghanistan , it will be by building the Afghan state , not by keeping it weak . ”
Image President Hamid Karzai says the American - led coalition in Afghanistan needs to do more to respect Afghans independence .

Mr. Karzai said he was fighting corruption , a problem that is among the chief complaints heard frequently by diplomats and Afghans alike .
Mr. Karzai said he had just fired an official the previous day and would be firing more soon .
Yet the president explained that Afghanistan had never had so much money and resources pouring in , or seen such disparities in salaries , and was simply not capable yet of preventing the corruption .
He admitted that “ lots of things ” in the last six years could have been handled better and singled out policies led by the United States , namely tackling terrorism and handling the Taliban , both as prisoners and on the battlefield .
On terrorism , he repeated a call he has made for several years , that sanctuaries across the border in Pakistan be closed off .
“ There is no way but to close the sanctuaries , ” he said .
“ Pakistan will have no peace , Pakistan ’s progress will suffer , so will Afghanistan ’s peace and progress , so will the world ’s .
If you want to live , and live in peace , and work for prosperity , that has to happen .
The sanctuaries must go , period . ”
Linux has been getting a lot of press over the past six months , particularly populist distributions such as Ubuntu .
Dell has installed Ubuntu onto its Linux PCs and laptops , and let ’s not forget the phenomenally successful Eee PC from Asus , which runs the Xandros distro .
The open source OS is also starting to make some headway on mobile phones in the form of the Google - backed Android and rival LiMo .
It all shows how accessible Linux has become .
A Windows guy meets Linux
I ’ve been using the Windows OS ever since version 3.0 .
So I ’ve got some intimate knowledge of the problems and foibles you run into when trying to install hardware and software .
I also own a MacBook running OS X , so I know how intuitive Apple 's OS is in comparison .
I 'm intrigued to see if 2008 is really the year when Linux is ready for prime - time .
Over the last few years I ’ve dabbled with Linux now and then , but I ’ve always found that there were too many problems for me to cope with , particularly when it came to hardware drivers .
However , Linux has made great strides on this front , so I was interested to see whether a distro like Ubuntu can let me do everything that I do in Windows and OS X .
Installing Ubuntu is actually pretty easy , although if you want to preserve your Windows partition and dual - boot , you need to take a few precautions .
First you need to download the CD image then burn that image to disc , using something like Nero .
Change your PC ’s BIOS to boot from CD , pop the disc in the drive and boot from the newly - created Ubuntu CD .
This will load up a live session .
In other words , everything is running from the CD , and memory , nothing has yet been installed .
It gives you a good opportunity to have a play around and get used to how Ubuntu Linux works .
To install to your hard drive , simply double - click on the install icon on the desktop and follow the wizard .
First steps with Ubuntu
One of the main problems with Microsoft 's Windows OS is that virtually everything on your motherboard , and anything you want to install , requires an appropriate driver .
This used to be the case with Linux , but like Apple ’s OS X , a large number of drivers are now built into the Linux kernel .
For instance , once you install Windows , you normally need to install all the motherboard drivers .
When I installed Ubuntu , this was n’t necessary .
Even more impressively , Ubuntu detected my wireless USB stick .
All it required was the WPA password and it connected straight to the Internet .
In Windows , a specific driver is needed .
The next device I tried was my Canon Pixma IP4300 Printer , which again needs drivers in Windows .
In Ubuntu , however , it was immediately detected and ready to use .
To be fair , the output was pretty basic , and a dedicated driver can be installed .
External USB hard drives formatted to FAT32 , were detected and mounted straightaway .
But to read and write to NTFS drives , I had to install the Fuse plugin .
My digital camera , once the ID was set as a ' mass storage device ' in its menus , was also detected and accessible .
A Bluetooth dongle was also recognised and worked without any fiddling , enabling me to transfer photos from my phone across to the Ubuntu environment in a matter of minutes .
So far I ’m impressed .
Setting up Ubuntu has been easier than Windows XP or Vista , and I ’ve had to install far fewer drivers .
Over the next four days , I ’ll find out how Ubuntu copes with a range of everyday tasks , from Internet shopping to productivity and playing games .
Getting - Things - Done freaks know what Pareto is .
Puting 80 % of efforts into 20 % of most important task is handy to manage day - to - day activities effectively , or even for conducting a small project .
But , can we Pareto - ed our feelings ?
On Thursday , last weekend , my mom called me .
She had things to do at Surabaya on Sunday - Monday .
Instantly , I offered her my hand .
My schedule changed a bit .
But it 's okay .
On Saturday , I had small discussion with my friend .
He said that my latest update ( it 's a programming thingy ) was a bit out of track .
It was n't no big deal ; I could fix them in one day .
The problem was , it was supposed to be online on Monday and working on Sunday was out of the question for me .
First conflict happened .
My wife called me just when I was about to go to pick up my mom .
Luna got her arm and leg bruised .
It 's easy to fix , nothing to worry about .
But knowing that I could n't make it home at that moment was breaking my heart .
That was the second .
To make things worse , here came the third .
I had a bit misunderstanding with a friend of mine .
It was due to my stupidity and stubbornness .
I hope I could talk to this friend so there would n't be any trouble again .
I wish I could but I can't .
And now , at this very moment , 6 unreplied emails are shouting at me : " How cruel you are , Andry !
We 're not just emails , we are your friends !
" You got the idea .
My belief teaches me that every man 's life belongs to his mother and every woman's to her husband .
Following these rules , we wo n't need " Men are From Mars Women are From Venus " or " Do n't Sweat Small Thing in Love " anymore .
I picked up my mom , of course .
When I was 16 I ran off from home for about two months .
My friends provided me with shelters .
My friends are my families .
I hope I do the same .
Here 's my question : Can we Pareto - ed our feelings ?
Can I put my mom under " urgent important " , my jobs under " urgent not important " , my friends under " not urgent important " , and my Luna under " urgent important " also ?
Surely , we can't please everyone .
But I hope there will be win-win solution ( and I do n't know how , darn it ! ) I 'm telling you .
It is so hard to be a programmer nowadays .
Among white , working - class voters  most commonly identified as those without a college degree 
Mrs. Clinton has won by 2 to 1 or better in states like Indiana , Kentucky , Ohio and Pennsylvania .
Mr. Obama has fared better among less culturally conservative working - class whites in states like Oregon , where the environment is a central issue for voters .
Still , Mrs. Clinton ’s claim that she is best positioned to win the “ hard - working Americans , white Americans ” has become the linchpin of her argument that she is more electable than Mr. Obama .
But Mr. Teixeira , who is not backing either candidate , does not buy that argument .
He dismisses intraparty contests as “ pretty poor evidence ” of whether Mr. Obama , as the Democratic nominee , could attract the blue - collar support he would need against Senator John McCain , the presumed Republican nominee .
No Majority Needed
And how much blue - collar support would Mr. Obama need ?
Not a majority , said Mr. Teixeira .
Though blue - collar Democrats once represented a centerpiece of the New Deal coalition , they have shrunk as a proportion of the information age - economy and as a proportion of the Democratic base .
Al Gore lost working - class white voters by 17 percentage points in 2000 , even while winning the national popular vote .
Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts lost them by 23 points in 2004 , while running within three points of President Bush over all .
Mr. Teixeira suggests that Mr. Obama can win the presidency if he comes within 10 to 12 percentage points of Mr. McCain with these voters , as Democratic candidates for the House did in the 2006 midterm election .
Moqtada
Sadr declared a truce last year but his militia remains powerful Iraqi Shia cleric Moqtada Sadr has threatened to wage " open war " on the Baghdad government if it does not halt operations against his supporters .
Moqtada
Sadr said he was giving the government a " last warning " , and urged it to take " the path of peace " .
His statement came as Iraqi troops , with US and UK support , clashed with his forces in Baghdad and the south .
In August the cleric 's militia declared a ceasefire , pledging not to attack government or foreign soldiers .
" I 'm giving the last warning and the last word to the Iraqi government , " Moqtada Sadr said .
" Either it comes to its senses and takes the path of peace ... or it will be ( seen as ) the same as the previous government , " he added , referring to former President Saddam Hussein 's fallen regime .
" If it does not stop the militias that have infiltrated the government , then we will declare an open war until liberation , " he added .
Wall controversy Moqtada Sadr issued the warning after soldiers launched fresh operations against positions being held by his Mehdi Army .
The BBC's Crispin Thorold in Baghdad says the government is slowly beginning to establish a presence in areas where the Mehdi Army had been all - powerful Iraqi troops are hoping to disarm Mehdi Army militiamen
In Baghdad the US army and Iraqi troops clashed with militiamen in the area of Sadr City .
Local hospitals say that seven people died .
Sadr City is the site of frequent confrontations between Shia fighters and Iraqi and coalition forces .
Tensions have been increased by the construction of a wall in the district by US and Iraqi forces .
They say the wall aims to hamper the militants who regularly fire mortars at the Green Zone , Baghdad 's huge diplomatic and government compound .
Also on Saturday , clashes were reported between Iraqi forces and the Mehdi Army in the southern city of Nasiriya .
Battle in Basra Meanwhile , in the southern city of Basra , Iraqi security forces , backed by British artillery and American warplanes , moved into the district of Hayania , where Moqtada Sadr also has strong support .
The operation , which apparently sought to seize illegally held weapons , opened with a massive display of firepower by supporting US and UK forces , who pounded a deserted area of the district with artillery .

Advertisement " British artillery and US planes conducted a firepower demonstration to the west of Hayania , to give a demonstration of the firepower available if required , " said a spokesman for British forces , Major Tom Holloway .
BBC sources said the operation first met fierce resistance .
But the latest reports say the violence has subsided .
Basra was the scene of intense fighting some three weeks ago , after Iraqi forces made an attempt to disarm militias operating in the city .
That operation ground to a halt when the army faced considerable resistance from the militias , including the Mehdi Army .
The fighting spread to various parts of Iraq , hundreds of people were killed and thousands of civilians were trapped in their homes for days on end .
The militias were never disarmed , only promising to take their weapons off the streets .
The operation was criticised by US commanders as poorly planned and as failing to achieve its stated aims .
Gen Mohan al Furaiji , the architect of the operation , was moved back to Baghdad , but the Iraqi government insisted he was not being fired .

Russia 's First Deputy Prime Minister and presidential front - runner , Dmitry Medvedev , speaks with journalists in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk February 15 , 2008 .

REUTERS / RIA Novosti/ Dmitry Astakhov
KRASNOYASK , Russia ( Reuters ) - Russia ’s president - in - waiting Dmitry Medvedev said on Friday media freedoms are guaranteed in Russia -- by the Internet .
The 42 - year - old Medvedev , currently Russia ’s First Deputy Prime Minister , told journalists he went online to check news and views at the beginning and end of each working day .
“ There is news from the main channels , regional channels , there is news from foreign channels and finally there is news produced , so to say , on media sites which hold opposition views against the authorities . ”
“ They can post all their clips and all their speeches there , generally they say unpleasant things about the authorities , ” he said after a speech in the Siberian city of Krasnoyask .
“ This guarantees the independence of the mass media , in my opinion . ”
Most Russians receive their news and information from television which is tightly controlled by the state .
The main newspapers are also dominated by pro-Kremlin groups and editors , consigning Russia ’s marginalised opposition media to the Internet , radio and low - circulation newspapers .
The hugely popular Russian President Vladimir Putin has named Medvedev as his preferred successor virtually guaranteeing him victory in a March 2 election .
All opinion polls show Medvedev far ahead of his opponents .

Gist understands why it hurts so much to be on food stamps .
After all , she 's got a master 's degree in psychology .
" There 's pride in being able to take care of yourself , " says the Columbus , Ohio , resident , laid off last year from a mortgage company and living on workers ' compensation benefits while recovering from surgery .
" I 'm not supposed to be in this condition . "
Neither are many of the 27.5 million Americans relying on government aid to keep food on their tables amid unemployment and rising prices .
Average enrollment in the food stamps program has surpassed the record set in 1994 , though the percentage of Americans on food stamps is still lower than records set in 1993 - 95 .
The numbers continue to climb .
Gist , 51 , is the new face of hunger in the USA .
She says she spent most of her adult life working as a mental health counselor before deciding to try real estate .
" I'm a professional person , " she says .
As economists nationally debate whether the country is in recession and policymakers discuss ways to drive down gas prices , a new category of Americans combats hunger .
Since 2006 , soaring food and fuel prices have combined with lost jobs and stagnant wages to boost the number of Americans needing food aid .
More than 41 % of those on food stamps came from working families in 2006 , up from 30 % a decade earlier , according to the latest Agriculture Department data .
They are real estate agents and homebuilders hit by the housing slump , seniors on Social Security , parents of students whose free breakfast and lunch programs do n't solve the problem of dinner .
Increasingly in recent months , they have signed up for food stamps and shown up at food pantries , trying to make ends meet .
" This last year 's been the worst , " says Gladys Pearson , 76 , a retired corrections officer , as she leaves a Bread for the City food pantry in Washington , D.C. , a three - day supply of staples in the basket of her walker .
She likens it to the 1950s , when her husband would come home with a small can of milk for their newborn daughter because a big one was too expensive .
Officials on the front lines say the need is growing .
•
At food stamp offices , employees are " seeing people from various occupations that they have never seen before , " says Vic Todd , administrator of Oregon 's Office of Self - Sufficiency Programs . •
At food banks , demand is up 15 % to 20 % over last year .
Pantries are serving " folks who get up and go to work every day , " says Bill Bolling , founder of the Atlanta Community Food Bank .
" That 's remarkably different than the profile of who we 've served through the years . " •
In schools , the school breakfast and lunch programs are serving more than 31 million students , which soon will give way to summer programs that serve just 3 million .
Kindergarteners in Baton Rouge are hoarding part of their lunches to eat later at home , says Mike Manning , president of the Greater Baton Rouge Food Bank .
In Reading , Pa. , Peg Bianca , executive director of the Greater Berks Food Bank , sees demand soaring for " weekenders " — backpacks of food intended to help students stay nourished until Monday .
Americans ' are really hurting '
" People are hurting , " says Kitty Schaller , executive director of the MANNA FoodBank in Asheville , N.C. , where one in six people get emergency food assistance .
" They are really hurting in a way that I think may well be unprecedented . "
Hunger in America is n't new .
The latest government data for 2006 show that 10.9 % of households were " food insecure , " a bureaucratic term meaning they did not have enough food for a healthy lifestyle at some point in the year .
In 4 % of households , no bureaucratic jargon was needed ; someone was going hungry .
Families with enough to eat spent 31 % more on food than those who did n't have enough .
The federal food stamps program has grown , shrunk and grown again since its creation in 1964 .
It was cut by Republicans when they took control of Congress in 1995 .
It has expanded during the past eight years , fueled by two economic slumps , relaxed rules regarding assets and an outreach campaign to sign up eligible families .
The program is restricted to households with incomes below 130 % of the federal poverty level , or $ 27,560 for a family of four .
They cannot have more than $ 2,000 or , in some cases , $ 3,000 in assets , not including homes and , in most states , cars .
The average benefit is about $ 3 a day per person .
Cost to the government : $ 38 billion , rising to $ 40 billion in 2009 .
It 's the largest weapon in the U.S. government 's 15 - program food aid arsenal , which now costs about $ 60 billion , up 76 % since 2001 .
" We do have a strong safety net available to help families in times of economic distress , " says Kate Houston , deputy undersecretary for food , nutrition and consumer services at the Department of Agriculture .
When the Bush administration proposed its 2008 budget in February 2007 , it projected that an average of 26.2 million people would get food stamps this year .
By the time the fiscal year began in October , however , enrollment already was 27.2 million and growing .
For next year , the administration plans for an average of 28 million .
Even so , only 65 % of eligible recipients are enrolled .
Among working families , only 57 % of those eligible for food stamps have signed up .
Gist joined the ranks of recipients after losing her job as a loan officer .
She says she was fired the day before she was to be paid her $ 27,000 share of the closing costs for four loans she negotiated .
The mortgage company is now out of business and , in an unfortunate twist , her home is in foreclosure .
She learned she was eligible for food stamps while having her taxes done for free .
" It 's embarrassing , " says Gist , who still hopes to stay in her home despite a scheduled sheriff 's sale Friday .
" It 's humbling . " ' Regular Joes ' on food stamps
Yet it 's not unusual .
Kevin McGuire , executive director of Maryland 's Family Investment Administration , which runs antipoverty programs , says many new food stamp clients are " regular - Joe working Americans . "
His state saw enrollment rise 13.8 % in the past year , fourth - highest in the USA .
When they get on food stamps , these new recipients find that the program does n't keep up with prices .
The inflation rate for items they 're encouraged to buy under the " thrifty food plan " is 5.6 % — more than the average 4.7 % for food .
Prices for basic items such as bread and milk pushed food prices up by almost 1 % in April alone ; bread costs 14.1 % more than it did a year ago , milk 13.5 % more .
Families with less than $ 10,000 in pre-tax income spend a larger share of their income on food — 17.1 % compared with a U.S. average of 12.6 % , according to a report last month by the Congressional Research Service .
Inflation hits them harder .
" Many of the people who are turning to food pantries today are reporting that their food stamps are n't even lasting two weeks out of every month , " says Lisa Hamler - Fugitt , executive director of the Ohio Association of Second Harvest Foodbanks .
The farm bill passed overwhelmingly by Congress last week partially addresses those issues .
It would invest $ 10.4 billion over five years in the food stamps program and food banks .
President Bush has vowed to veto the bill because of its subsidies to wealthy farmers , but the House and Senate votes indicate Congress is likely to override him for only the second time .
In the meantime , more Americans will cut corners .
It does n't " stretch as far as they say it does , " says Brenda Tanner , 45 , of Asheville , N.C. , who raises two teenage daughters on $ 623 a month in disability payments and $ 289 a month in food stamps .
She buys in bulk and no longer goes out to eat .
" Milk is as high as gas , " she says .
" That 's crazy . "
Near the Capitol , no more cereal Even with one in every 11 Americans receiving food stamps , millions who do n't qualify also need help .
They are joining food stamp recipients at food pantries nationwide , where they receive bags of food intended to last a few days .
" Many people are in desperate financial straits who are not eligible for food stamps , " says House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif. , who pushed to pass the farm bill .
Second Harvest , the nation 's largest network of food banks , says demand is up an average of 15 % to 20 % from a year ago .
More than 80 % of its food banks reported in a survey completed this month that they could not meet demand without trimming operations or reducing the amount of food given out .
Donations are down , particularly from the federal government as well as private companies .
Farmers are selling their crops on the open market at record prices , rather than giving them to the government through price - support programs .
To compensate , the Agriculture Department has traded raw commodities for finished goods that can be provided to food banks .
Earlier this month , it chipped in with $ 50 million in frozen pork patties .
Costs are up , particularly for diesel fuel needed to deliver food to pantries by truck .
Nearly half of the food banks now buy some of their food or are considering doing so , rather than relying on donations .
" It 's really a perfect storm , " says Maura Daly , Second Harvest 's vice president of government affairs .
At Bread for the City in Washington , less than 2 miles from the White House and the Capitol , food and clothing director Ted Pringle can't buy cereal anymore because of the price of grain , wheat and corn .
Fresh fruit jumped by 3.2 % nationally in April .
" It scares me to buy fruit , " Pringle says .
Food banks across the country are on the front lines as demand increases and supply dwindles : • In Oakland , the number of monthly calls into the Alameda County Community Food Bank has risen 28 % from last year .
Since July , each month has set a new record .
•
In Tyler , Texas , the East Texas Food Bank has stopped buying rice and pinto beans in bulk quantities because they 're too expensive .
Some of the pantries it serves no longer can drive up to two hours to the central food bank because of a 64 % increase in fuel costs .
•
In Detroit , executive director Augie Fernandes is seeing more seniors on fixed incomes " who are very proud " come into the Gleaners Community Food Bank of Southeastern Michigan .
• In Ponca City , Okla. , the local food pantry is serving more than 500 people a month , a 20 % increase from last year .
As a result , it 's had to cut their monthly allotments from three bags of food to two .
•
In Nashville , program services manager Kelli Garrett sees former volunteers and donors arrive as clients at Second Harvest Food Bank of Middle Tennessee .
" They feel a certain level of shame having to ask for help , " she says .
•
In Alaska , 15 remote food pantries have closed because they lacked sufficient government commodities .
" At one point , we were down to vegetarian beans , " says Susannah Morgan , executive director of the Food Bank of Alaska .
Things are better now :
They have grape juice , green beans and frozen apricot cups .
•
In Orlando , Dave Krepcho of the Food Bank of Central Florida has eight trucks and a tractor - trailer on the road full time , picking up food from grocery stores .
He worries about low - income children home from school this summer .
Krepcho , the food bank 's executive director , has been in the business 16 years .
" This is the worst that I 've ever seen it , " he says , " by far . "

Ideas Class fictions
In two recent novels set on elite campuses , social class is a figment of the ' neoliberal imagination . '
THE SCARIEST THING about the first day of school in two recent novels - Curtis Sittenfeld 's '' Prep " and Tom Wolfe 's ' ' I am Charlotte Simmons " - is finding out what the other girls are wearing ( the answer at both schools is flip flops and shorts ) .
But the hardest thing is surviving the moment when your family meets your new roommate 's family .
Wolfe 's Charlotte is relieved when she sees the flip flops and the shorts , since she 's wearing shorts , too ; Sittenfeld 's Lee is horrified , since she 's wearing ''a long dress with peach and lavender flowers and a lace collar . "
But Charlotte 's advantage disappears when it comes to the families since , although Lee is '' embarrassed " by her father , Charlotte is '' mortified " by hers .
What embarrasses Lee is that her father responds , '' No sir , I 'm in the mattress business " to her roommate 's father who , having heard they 're from South Bend , says , '' I take it you teach at Notre Dame . " '' I was embarrassed that my father called Dede 's father sir , " Lee says , '' embarrassed by his job , and embarrassed by our rusted white Datsun . "
Charlotte 's mortification trumps
Lee 's embarrassment on every count , from the car - since her Daddy drives a rusted out pickup truck with a fiberglass camper top - to the job :
He does n't actually have one .
'' Used to be I operated a last - cutting machine over't the Thom McAn factory in Sparta , " he says , '' but Thom McAn , they relocated to Mexico .
'' Now , " he tells them , '' I take care ' - keer -' of a house some summer people got over't Roaring Gap . "
Charlotte is at her college ( something like Duke ) on a scholarship , and Lee is also on scholarship at her prep school - modeled on Groton , where Sittenfeld herself went ( and where Charlotte 's roommate is supposed to have gone ) .
And the meaning of all the embarrassment is more social than personal .
Anybody can be embarrassed by her parents , but these girls are embarrassed by their parents ' class - by the fact that ( at Groton and Duke if not in the world ) , everybody else is rich , or at least , richer .
'' American writers , " Lionel Trilling wrote in '' The Liberal Imagination " ( 1950 ) , '' have a kind of resistance to looking closely at society , " and by society he meant '' class " and , in particular , '' the meeting and conflict of diverse social classes . "
Writing at a moment when liberalism seemed to him so dominant that there were '' no conservative or reactionary ideas in circulation , " Trilling identified liberalism 's triumph with the refusal of American writers to acknowledge that class could still make a difference in any individual life .
Of course , it was '' American writers of genius " ( Faulkner , Dos Passos , etc. ) that Trilling was interested in and , while the verdict is still out on the 30 - something Curtis Sittenfeld , it 's pretty clear that the 70 - something Tom Wolfe has n't made it .
But they do get credit for attempting to imagine an America in which the fact that some people have more money than others matters .
It is n't , however , her actual poverty that makes college life hard for Charlotte ; what drives Charlotte and Wolfe crazy is the ' ' condescension , " the way all the students who went to Groton and whose parents never got laid off by Thom McAn and who know exactly what to wear and what attitudes to have - " the liberal elite , " as Wolfe would have it - make Charlotte feel as if they are better than she is .
And this is n't just Tom Wolfe 's issue .
The equivalent in '' Prep " is being identified as ' ' LMC , " Lower Middle Class .
So the problem in both these novels is class privilege .
And the solution : Poor people should n't be made to feel inferior , either in novels or in life .
In a recent real world application , The Harvard Crimson is unhappy about a new service , called Dormaid , that offers to clean students ' rooms for $ 85 ( neither Charlotte nor Lee could afford the service ) .
The ' 'obvious display of wealth , " the Crimson objected last March , '' will establish a perceived , if unspoken , barrier between students of different economic means " and thus compromise the ' ' egalitarian nature of dorm life . "
'' There are both rich people and poor people at Harvard , " the Crimson ( and '' Prep " and ' ' I am Charlotte Simmons " ) tells us , and keeping maids out of the dorms will eliminate what the Crimson calls the ' ' unneeded distinctions between the rich and the poor . "
And yet , it 's only in the most literal sense that there are rich people and poor people at Harvard .
There are , in reality , very few poor people at Harvard or , for that matter , at any of the 146 colleges that count as '' selective " : 3 percent of the students in these institutions come from where Charlotte Simmons is supposed to come from , the lowest socioeconomic quarter of American society , while 74 percent come from the highest , according to a 2003 report published by the Century Foundation .
And from this standpoint , we can see that the point of objecting to conspicuous displays of wealth at school is not so much to avoid offending the poor people at Harvard as it is to pretend that there are meaningful numbers of poor people at Harvard to be offended .
Indeed , that 's what the attraction of these novels is all about - the work they do is not in exposing the injustices of class difference at Groton and Duke but in imagining that there are class differences at Groton and Duke .
Schools loom larger in the neoliberal imagination than they did in the liberal imagination because where the old liberalism was interested in mitigating the inequalities produced by the free market , neoliberalism - with its complete faith in the beneficence of the free market - is interested instead in justifying them .
And our schools have a crucial role to play in this .
They have become our primary mechanism for convincing ourselves that poor people deserve their poverty , or , to put the point the other way around , they have become our primary mechanism for convincing rich people that we deserve our wealth .
Everybody gets that people who graduate from elite schools have a sizeable economic advantage over people who do n't ; that 's one reason why people want to go to them .
And as long as the elite schools are themselves open to anybody who 's smart enough and / or hard - working enough to get into them , we see no injustice in reaping the benefits .
It 's OK if schools are technologies for producing inequality as long as they are also technologies for justifying it .
But the justification will only work if , as the Crimson hopefully imagines , there really are significant class differences at Harvard .
If there really are n't - if it 's your wealth ( or your family 's wealth ) that makes it possible for you to go to an elite school in the first place - then , of course , the real source of your success is not the fact that you went to an elite school but the fact that your parents were rich enough to give you the kind of preparation that got you admitted to the elite school .
The function of the ( very few ) poor people at Harvard is to reassure the ( very many ) rich people at Harvard that you can't just buy your way into Harvard .
Naturally , novels about scholarship students make only a minor contribution to convincing us that the students in elite colleges are there because they deserve to be .
Affirmative action - designed to convince all the white kids that they did n't get in just because they were white - plays a somewhat bigger role ( hence the passionate support for it among upper - middle - class white students :
Every black face they see on campus makes them feel better about themselves ) .
But , of course , the biggest role of all is played by the intense competition among the rich kids to get into the most prestigious of the elite schools .
No moment in '' Prep " is more believable than when the bad behavior of a senior is explained by the fact that he 's bitter '' because he 's going to Trinity " instead of to one of his top choices .
But while it no doubt matters to your self - esteem if you go to one of the really prestigious elite schools instead of to one of the not - so - prestigious ones , it does n't much matter to your economic position .
The difference , in other words , between the people who go to Trinity and the ones who go to Harvard is a difference in status , not class .
And if status , as the sociologist Richard Sennett says in '' Respect in a World of Inequality " ( 2003 ) , ''usually refers to where a person stands in a social hierarchy , " it 's crucially not reducible to where a person stands economically .
In fact , the inequalities of status presume a certain equality of wealth .
If we can't imagine that we competed on a level playing field , how can we take any pleasure in winning ?
The imaginative world of neoliberalism , then , is a world where it 's OK for a few people to be rich and a lot of people to be poor but where it 's definitely not OK to make anyone feel bad about being poor .
As Lee 's mom says , '' being rich does n't make you a better person . "
Indeed the very thing wrong with the liberal elite - the thing , at least , that right - wing neoliberals like Wolfe are always taking them to task for - is that they think being rich does make them better people , or at least that being better people is what made them rich .
On this model , then , class is turned into clique and , once the advantages of class are redescribed as the advantages of status , we get the recipe for what we might call right - wing egalitarianism : Respect the poor .
Which is also , as it turns out , the recipe for left - wing egalitarianism .
If in 1950 Trilling thought there were no conservatives or reactionaries , we might say today that there are only conservatives and reactionaries .
Where the neoliberal right likes status instead of class , the neoliberal '' left " likes cultural identity , and its version of '' respect the poor " is '' respect the Other . "
That 's why multiculturalism could go from proclaiming itself a subversive politics to taking up its position as a corporate management technology in about 10 minutes .
Today , what Trilling called '' diverse social classes " has turned into what we just call diversity .
And diversity gives us what we might call the fantasy of a left politics - a politics defined by its opposition to racism , sexism , and homophobia and hence by the idea that what we should do with difference is not eliminate it but appreciate it .
Classism is the key here because classism is the pseudo - problem that brings left and right , conservatives and reactionaries together , and it's why otherwise utterly anodyne texts like '' Prep " and ' ' I am Charlotte Simmons " have a certain interest .
Classism is what you 're a victim of not because you 're poor but because people are n't nice to you because you 're poor .
For neoliberals , in other words , it 's prejudice not poverty that counts as the problem , and if , at the heart of the liberal imagination , as Trilling understood it , was the desire not to have to think about class difference , at the heart of the neoliberal imagination is the desire not to have to get rid of class difference .
Almost always it takes the form of insisting that class does n't matter , that , '' In America , " as New York Times columnist David Brooks , anticipating Charlotte 's mom , once wrote , '' Nobody is better , nobody is worse . "
Of course it might be objected that , when it comes to being healthier , safer , freer , and happier , being rich does indeed make you better and that a more just society would imagine a more just distribution of money , health , safety , and freedom .
But the politics of the neoliberal imagination involve respecting the poor , not getting rid of poverty .

Sergio could n't have woken up in a better mood .
When his radio turned on at 6:00 AM , the weatherman predicted nothing but sunshine , warmth , happiness , smiles , and hugs .
He shaved , dressed up , and got ready for the drive to the Federal Department of Government .
Sergio's company had just scored a major contract after a long negotiation process , barely passing the obstacle course phase of the Federal Department of Government 's rigid requirements for a bid to even be considered .
Sergio was so happy because he was , to a large degree , in charge .
He 'd determine the architecture , the database design , and he was in charge of gathering requirements for the six - month contract .
Arriving at the Federal Department of Government office , he met with Craig , the tech lead .
Craig had been promoted by seniority , and did n't have any apparent technical background or , for that matter , any apparent technical knowledge .
Craig politely introduced himself and explained the requirements to Sergio .
Gathering Requirements
" OK , so what we need here , " Craig started , " is a way to get all these paper forms into a computer . "
He pointed at an open closet that was near the building entrance that Sergio had come through .
From where they were sitting , it looked like stacks of thousands of sheets of paper .
These forms were shipped to the FDoG daily , and contained information about workflows , organizations , projects , and contacts .
Clearly , they 'd fallen behind on processing the forms .
Immediately Sergio's thoughts drifted to automated scanning , cataloguing , OCR software , and other technologies that he'd never really worked with before .
" So , " Sergio began , his thoughts returning to reality , " you want these to be scanned in , or ... "
" No , I 'll take care of typing all of the information in .
We had a tech guy before that left about a year ago the last time we tried to get this project going .
He said we should use , " Craig looked down at his notepad .
" ' Visuals Basic . '
Have you ever used that ?
We already have a database that you can use .
And it has to run in Windows . "
Sergio was scribbling notes furiously , holding his questions until he was done writing .
" Did you say you were going to do all the data entry ? "
" Yeah .
I 'm a very fast typist ! "
Sergio's eyes returned to the closet with the stack of paper that appeared larger each time he looked at it .
There was at least a years ' worth of full - time data entry .
" Are you sure you want to do that all yourself ? " Sergio asked .
" It looks like there 's an awful lot to do . "
Craig smirked and nodded , with a smug yeah , I think I 've got this covered look on his face .
Sergio continued .
" By 'has to run in Windows , ' do you mean as a Windows application ?
We can't do this on the web ? "
Craig rolled his eyes , " God no !
On top of how insecure web applications are , they 're so hard to use !
Take a look at this , " he said as he turned a monitor to face Sergio .
A horrid , ugly web - based version of the software Sergio was tasked with building was on Craig 's screen .
Craig demonstrated some common functions , many of which were throwing primary key violation errors , syntax errors whenever Craig entered a single quote in a field , and frequent crashes .
" Our last guy had this in an Access database , which he was able to delete right before he left .
We do n't do web applications anymore . "
The last IT guy deleted the whole database ?
Sergio tried to keep his composure .
" Well , you do realize that if it 's a Windows application , you 'll have to distribute the installer , teach people how to install it , grant users network access to the database ? "
All this on top of the absence of a real IT guy , plus FDoG was n't paying Sergio 's company for any additional training .
Around the time that Sergio uttered the phrase " distribute the installer , " Craig 's eyes glazed over .
Craig gave the look that your grandma would give you if you asked her to do a traceroute .
Sergio sighed quietly .
Windows forms it is .
Data Entry
After a few months of development , it was time for data entry .
And after four hours of keying the data from a stack of papers , another box came in with more papers to add to the pile , totally negating ( and then some ) Craig 's work .
Noticing this , Sergio again asked if a handful data entry clerks could be added to the project .
Craig looked less smug this time , but still insisted that he be the one to do it .
" This is highly sensitive data here !
I have to be the one to do this . "
Sergio would be dead by the time Craig finished the task .
And unless Craig was planning to have a lifespan of Old Testament proportions , he 'd never finish .
And Sergio could n't help but think it was a little bizarre that such sensitive data was in an open closet that did n't even have a lock on it , and that it was positioned right near the entrance ( also unlocked ) .
Near the end of the following day , Sergio got a panicked call from Craig .
" We 're having huge problems here ; the forms are n't working correctly , and I can't get anything done until this is fixed ! "
Sergio had the sinking feeling that he'd left off a WHERE clause on a DELETE query somewhere .
" What 's the problem that you 're seeing ? "
" I can't really explain it — you 're just going to have to come in first thing tomorrow morning . "
Sergio got up extra early the following morning and rushed to the FDoG .
An Emergency Issue
" Thank god you 're here , " Craig began .
" Watch this . "
Sergio swallowed a lump in his throat .
Craig maximized the window .
After a second or two , he restored down .
" Did you see that ? "
He repeated the process .
" See how the typing boxes and buttons and stuff resize when I click the shrink and the deshrink ? "
The form elements resized automatically as Craig changed the window size , exactly as it was supposed to .
Sergio stared in disbelief .
" It should n't do that , " Craig said .
" It should look exactly like the printed page . "
" For the short term , you may just want to change your resolution , " Sergio suggested .
" I do n't even know what the ' resolution ' is !
Just get this fixed ! "
Sergio provided a workaround ( " do n't maximize " ) and fixed the application later that day .
A New Hope
Months passed , seasons changed , and the contract had ended long ago .
When Sergio was done , about 500 of the tens of thousands of records had been entered .
It was government work , after all .
Sergio had put the whole contract behind him .
And one random morning , he woke up in a great mood .
When his radio turned on at 6:00 AM , the weatherman predicted nothing but sunshine , warmth , happiness , smiles , and hu- * RING *
Sergio's phone was ringing , and the caller ID showed Craig 's number .
When Sergio answered , he was surprised to hear a woman 's voice .
" Sergio ?
Hi , my name is Sheila .
I 've replaced Craig and have some ideas for our application that I hear you worked on . "
" Oh ? "
" Yes , " Sheila said enthusiastically .
" I was thinking that we could bring in some data entry people to help us with all the paperwork we 're behind on .
Craig only finished about 800 of them before I took over , and we 're running out of closet space . "
" Go on , " said Sergio , feeling a bit of déjà vu .
" And I was also thinking that this should be web - based .
As it stands , we have to distribute the installer , teach people how to install it , and grant users network access to the database . "
Finally , Sergio thought , a voice of reason at the Federal Department of Government !
She actually gets it !
Not only that , but a voice that vindicated everything he had suggested before .
Plus the contract was practically a lock , which would make Sergio the hero for his company .
He could n't help but smile broadly .
" This all sounds great ! "
" Fantastic , " Sheila said excitedly .
" Our network administrator says our network is already secure , so no need to worry about that .
If you can just make those few adjustments I 'd like to have this on the web by the afternoon ! "
On Jan. 8 , the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted Apple Inc. a trademark for the three - dimensional shape of its iPod media player .
This was more than a recognition of an innovative product design .
It also was Apple 's capping piece in a multiyear marketing and legal campaign that pushed intellectual - property rights to new competitive advantage for the company .
In many ways , Apple is benefiting from an expansion of U.S. trademark rights , beyond the traditional names , images , logos and two - dimensional symbols trademarks usually secure .
In recent years , trademarks have been granted for such things as product shapes , colors and scents that companies can claim are linked exclusively to the source company in consumers ' minds .
These nontraditional marks are difficult to obtain .
But unlike more commonly used utility and design patents , which exist to cover functions and the ornamental look and feel of products and expire after a set number of years , trademarks can remain in force potentially forever .
The iPod shape trademark gives Apple a new weapon in the fiercely competitive market for media players .
While competitors may eventually appropriate the iPod 's inner workings , as utility patents expire , they will risk litigation if their products come too close to the trademarked shape of the iPod , including its popular circular - touchpad interface .

The provincial government is using social networking sites like Facebook and MySpace to investigate when there are allegations people lied on their welfare applications .
Announcements , Events & more from Tyee and select partners John Horton ’s Paintings Preserve History .
His Seamanship Saves Lives
Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
A message circulated in recent weeks to advocates working with people who receive financial help from the government warns that investigators use the Internet sites to look for evidence of " undisclosed co-habitation ( living with someone ) , spending beyond what is provided by the ministry , casual employment , leaving the province for more than 30 days , gifts , pets and other income . "
In each of those cases , the information might affect how much welfare a person could receive , or whether they would be eligible for help at all .
" They are using this information , based on postings on personal websites , to deny welfare and disability pensions , " the warning says .
" Anyone on long term disability or involved in collection action or the Canadian Revenue Authority should also be aware : Information posted on sites like Facebook is not private ! " reads the e-mail , which the Tyee could not trace back to its original source .
Spies log on
The Ministry of Employment and Income Assistance does not use the websites to assess whether an applicant is eligible for welfare , says ministry spokesperson Richard Chambers , but if workers receive allegations of fraud they could use the sites for confirmation .
" Facebook or MySpace , yeah , depending on what kind of allegations are brought to our attention , we might use that to follow up on a complaint , " he says .
When people apply for welfare they fill out forms stating their income levels , savings , assets and whether they own a vehicle , says Chambers .
They also include their marital status , number of children and other personal details .
" They voluntarily sign documents stating the information they are about to provide is accurate and the ministry is able to verify the information they provide is accurate . "
If they do not sign the documents , the government will not give them welfare .
" One of the policies is to make sure income assistance is going to people who are eligible , " says Chambers .
" We take allegations of fraud seriously .
In fact we are mandated to investigate every allegation of fraud we get from any source . "
That might mean reading a story in a local newspaper about someone who is selling crafts at a community market , then checking to see if the person is receiving welfare , he says .
Or it might mean looking for details on Internet sites .
" Obviously people 's privacy is very important and if we had no reason to look at someone , we would not , " says Chambers .
" We do not routinely scan people .
We 'd only scan if it was brought to our attention there was a reason to scan . "
Serious warning
While the ministry has over 100 workers investigating welfare fraud , it is unclear how commonly they cyber spy .
" I have n't encountered anyone who 's had that happen , but I would n't be surprised , " says Maria Montgomery , an advocate with the Together Against Poverty society in Victoria .
She estimated she talks to 80 people on welfare each month .
Such an investigation would be invasive , she says .
" I do n't know it would be honest of them to do that without warning people , " she says .
" I think there 'd be some concerns they might be going beyond what the legislation says they can do to verify people 's personal information . "
People working in the field are taking the warning seriously , says Bruce Wallace , a researcher with the Vancouver Island Public Interest Research Group and a co-author of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives ' report Denied Assistance .
There are problems with relying on the websites , he says .
Any information could be posted by people other than the client , perhaps even for malicious reasons .
There may be confusion when people have the same or similar names .
Not everything that people post is true or up to date .
The ministry would not rely on information from the Internet in making decisions , Chambers says .
Instead workers would use it as a point to start a conversation with the client .
New medium , old tricks
In the past the ministry has done things like cross referenced its welfare roles with lists of lottery winners to see if anyone had undeclared winnings , Wallace says .
Officials used to also make unannounced home visits until a B.C. Public Interest Advocacy Centre lawsuit changed the practice in 2006 .
" This is the new form of the spouse - in - the - house attack , " says Wallace .
Since officials can't visit homes and count the toothbrushes in the bathroom , they are turning to cyber spying .
Everyone should be careful about what they post publicly , he says , adding he has personally avoided joining Facebook and similar sites .
There are plenty of stories of normally cautious people , the sorts who keep unlisted phone numbers , posting their names , pictures of their kids and other personal details on the Internet .
The NDP 's income assistance critic , Jagrup Brar , says he does not condone fraud , but he's not sure the government should be paying people to check social websites for evidence of client wrongdoing .
" This is a huge job to look into these kinds of thing , " he says .
" I think this would be a huge waste of time if ministry officials are doing something like this . "
The ministry employs over 100 investigative officers and another 22 ministry investigators .
In the 2006 - 2007 fiscal year the finance ministry 's loss management branch recovered about $ 1 million in " overpayments . "
That represents about 0.1 percent of the $ 1.25 billion the ministry paid to clients that year .

London Gold Market Report from Adrian Ash BullionVault 08:20 EST , Thurs 10 April SPOT GOLD PRICES rose to an eight - session high for US investors above $ 939 per ounce as the Wall Street open drew near on Thursday as world stock markets fell and broad commodity prices rose 2.3 % .
In Frankfurt , Germany , the European Central Bank voted to keep its target interest rate on hold at 4.0 % , helping cap the Gold Price in Euros at a two - day high of �590 per ounce .
But for British investors and savers wanting to Buy Gold today , the price moved to a two - week high � some 2.8 % above Wednesday 's opening level � after the Bank of England cut its key interest rate to 5.0 % .
That decision took the net returns paid to cash after inflation and basic - rate tax � even at the new , lower 20 % level � back below zero .
" Gold 's role as an ultimate monetary asset is growing in confidence amongst the investors and that is widely seen from accelerated investment demand , " said Vision Commodities in Dubai to Reuters earlier today .
" The Gold Market is still in favor of bulls , and occasional slides to key supports should n't question the long term trend . "
Crude oil remained above $ 111 per barrel , just below Wednesday 's fresh all - time record sparked by a sharp deterioration in US energy stockpiles .
Government bond prices also rose worldwide , however , pushing the yield offered by 3 - month US Treasury bills to 1.30 % as equities dropped 1.3 % in Tokyo and 1.6 % in Europe .
Consumer price inflation in the United States was last pegged at 4.0 % year - on - year in February .
In contrast to US and UK central bank lending decisions , open - market interest rates show " a widening of credit spreads ... indicating further structural risks to the global financial system , " note Walter de Wet and Manqoba Madinane for Standard Bank in Johannesburg today .
Lehman Bros. was forced on Wednesday to close three failed investment funds and take their losses back onto its balance - sheet .
Overnight , " money markets in Europe and the US also reflected a tightening in liquidity conditions , " the Standard Bank analysts go on .
" The spread between central bank overnight lending rate and [ open - market interbank rates ] climbed to 77.5 basis points � close to the 80 bps spread following Bear Stearns .
" These structural risks should lift safe - haven investment demand into the metals complex in the near term . "
US stock market futures pointed 0.5 % lower as Thursday 's opening drew near , adding to yesterday 's 1.8 % loss after Lehman 's announcement .
Goldman Sachs said its exposure to so - called " Level 3 assets " � illiquid investments lacking keen buyers at any price � rose by nearly 40 % between Nov. and March .
Morgan Stanley 's pot of hard - to - sell assets grew by 6.1 % over that period thanks to the worst " market disruptions " its CEO , John Mack , has seen during his 40 years on Wall Street .
" If you look at this [ financial crisis ] situation , because we 've got low inflation [ in the UK ] we can cut interest rates , " claimed British prime minister Gordon Brown ahead of today 's decision from the Bank of England .
Widely criticized for interfering with the Bank 's apparent independence , Mr.Brown no doubt missed the persistence of Retail Price Inflation above 4.0 % throughout 2007 and 2008 to date � the worst run of sustained inflation since the last UK recession of 1992 .
Thursday morning also brought news that DSG International � owner of the cut - price Currys and PC World electronics chains � has suffered a sharp fall in both earnings and profit margins , sending the group 's shares 6 % lower at the London Stock Exchange .

Y'all probably remember my lengthy Comcast saga last month ( posts here , here , here , here , here , here and here ) .
The whole thing was extremely frustrating and took way too long to resolve -- and might never have been resolved at all , if not for corporate intervention which was due solely to the fact that I 'm a blogger .
Yet despite all the angst , Comcast managed to keep my business -- even after the revelation that they were stealing my cable -- by fixing the problem and giving me a refund .
Here 's the thing .
Some time ago , in a development unrelated to our high - speed Internet woes , Becky and I decided to cancel our cable TV service during the summer .
We 'd been looking for ways to trim our budget , and we concluded that we really do n't need cable during the interregnum between college - basketball season and college - football season .
The only real thing I 'd miss would be watching The Weather Channel in the event of a landfalling hurricane , but those are more likely to happen in late August and September anyway , by which point we 'll have reactivated our service for football season .
And anyway , the mere , slim possibility of missing Jim Cantore get all bug - eyed about a July hurricane probably is n't worth a summer 's worth of $ 49.95 / month bills .
I dawdled a bit about actually canceling our service ( partly because I did n't want to miss Wolf 's calls of the April and May primaries ) , but finally , earlier this month , we bought an antenna from Best Buy for like $ 15 , and I then called Comcast to cancel our cable service ... whereupon I was told that we'd have to return our cable box first , or else pay $ 29 for them to come pick it up .
This is slightly annoying , since there 's a Comcast truck at our apartment complex every damn day , but whatever ; so Becky drove down to the local office and returned the box .
She then instructed them to cancel our cable TV service -- to which the customer service lady replied that such a cancellation would cause our Internet bill to increase " from $ 42.95 to $ 57.95 . "
This was new information , so Becky held off on canceling anything , in order that she and I could consult about what to do .
The purported $ 15 increase was news to me , for two reasons .
One , I was unaware that our Internet rate was any kind of a promotion related to our cable TV service .
As far as I knew , we had been paying a fixed , non-promotional rate for high - speed Internet service that was unrelated to anything else .
Secondly , the lady 's comment was odd because we do n't pay $ 42.95 per month for high - speed Internet -- we pay $ 52.95 .
Where , I wondered , did she get the $ 42.95 figure from ?
So I went to Comcast 's website and checked their current rates , and as it turns out , $ 42.95 is now the base rate -- not the promotional rate , but the basic , long - term , fixed rate -- for high - speed Internet customers who also have cable TV .
If you sign up as a new Internet customer , you get six months at $ 19.95 / month , after which your bill increases to $ 42.95 / month .
By contrast , when we signed up , back in the long - ago dark ages known as May 2007 , $ 42.95 was our promotional rate ; it then increased to $ 52.95 , which is what it 's been ever since .
Now , I understand the purpose of promotional rates -- they gotta attract new customers -- and so I 'm not going to get too high - horsey about the $ 19.95 rate and the " how dare you fail to reward my customer loyalty " concept .
Although , that said , I must admit , it is somewhat galling to think that new customers are , during their promotional period , paying more than 2 1 / 2 times less than what I 've been paying ; that seems a bit excessive .
But that 's not my real issue .
My real issue is this : if the basic , non-promotional rate for new customers has decreased to $ 42.95 , then my rate should have decreased too .
Promotional rates are one thing , but it 's absolutely unconscionable for Comcast to continue charging me $ 52.95 / month indefinitely , when new customers will be getting a flat $ 42.95 / month rate , after their promotion expires , which will continue indefinitely .
When telecommunications companies raise their rates , everybody 's bill goes up ; well , when they lower their rates , everybody 's bill should go down .
That 's just common sense .
To illustrate this point , suppose I had kept my service for another five years .
In 2013 , I would still be paying $ 52.95 per month , while a customer who signs up today would be paying $ 42.95 .
So , over the course of the 54 months after the expiration of the new customer 's six - month promotional period , Comcast would have collected $ 540 more from me than from him , for the same service , during the same time period .
Why ?
Because I 'm a more loyal , long - term customer !
How on earth does that make any sense ?
Needless to say , when I realized this , I was pissed off .
And then , on top of it , now Comcast was saying they wanted to increase my Internet rate by $ 5 , from $ 52.95 / month to $ 57.95 / month , because I was canceling my cable TV service .
So now I 'd be paying $ 15 more -- for the same service -- than what the new customer ( with cable TV service ) pays long - term , and $ 38 more than his promotional rate .
Are you freaking kidding me ??
You can afford to provide this service to other people for $ 19.95 temporarily , and $ 42.95 indefinitely , and yet you want to charge me not just $ 52.95 , but $ 57.95 for it ??
For the same damn service ??
Well , ladies and gentlemen , that $ 5 was the straw that broke the camel 's back .
It was the one final indignity , heaped on top of a pile of Comcast - related indignities , that I was n't willing to accept .
First you send out an incompetent tech who says I have an " Indiana modem " ; then you make me drive to your office repeatedly to fix problems that you caused ; then you schedule a visit and do n't show up for it ; then it takes you four visits to diagnose and fix a technical problem that you caused ; then you try to charge me for one of the unsuccessful visits to fix that problem ; then I find out you 've been overcharging me by $ 10 / month ; and now you want to charge me $ 5 more , just so I can have the privilege of canceling an unrelated service that I happen to also buy from your company ?
I think not .
F*** no .
So , last week , I called AT&T and ordered DSL .
It 's substantially slower than Comcast cable Internet , but it's also substantially cheaper -- $ 19.95 / month -- and I figured the slowness wo n't matter that much for regular web browsing and the like .
I set it up over the weekend , and so far , I 've been correct ; the connection seems plenty fast for our needs .
I then called Comcast on Monday and told them to disconnect my service entirely , both cable TV and high - speed Internet .
Buh - bye .
When it comes time to put away the rabbit ears in late August , I do n't know for sure where we 'll be living , but if we 're still in Comcast - only territory , I 'll definitely give DirecTV and Dish Network a very close look .
For all the sincere efforts of good , friendly , competent corporate and local - office employees to fix my problems ( and thus prevent further bad P.R. from my blog ) , the bad still definitely outweighs the good here .
Comcast has earned my scorn .
Interestingly , the Comcast phone representative I spoke with yesterday was unfazed by the news that I was canceling my service .
In contrast to the TiVo rep I spoke with the previous day , who offered me four months of free service in order to entice me not to cancel , the Comcast rep perfunctorily asked me why I was canceling , seemed uninterested in my answer , and then matter - of - factly informed me that my service will be disconnected next Tuesday , April 27 .
( I was assured I wo n't be charged for the eight days of service in the interim .
Based on past experience with erroneous billing charges , I strongly suspect that I will be charged , and I 'll have to raise bloody murder to get a refund for that ~ $ 30 .
I will , of course , do so . )
I guess it makes sense for Comcast reps to be unfazed by customers canceling their service .
If this is how Comcast treats its customers -- and the terrible satisfaction ratings indicate that it is ; indeed , I 've gotten much better service than most , because of my blog -- they must get a lot of cancellations .

The car was pulled over on the Ross Highway , south of Alice Springs
A car driver in Australia has been fined for strapping down his beer rather than his young child .
Police said they were " shocked and appalled " when they pulled over the car south of Alice Springs in Australia 's Northern Territory .
They said the 30 - can pack of beer was strapped down between two adults in the back , with the five - year - old child unrestrained on the floor .
The driver was handed a fine of A$ 750 ( US$ 709 ; £ 362 ) .
The fine was for failing to ensure a child was wearing a seatbelt as well as driving an unregistered and uninsured vehicle .
' Blank ' look
The car was pulled over on the Ross Highway last Friday .
Constable Wayne Burnett said : " I have n't ever seen something like this before .
" This is the first time that the beer has taken priority over a child ...
The child was sitting in the lump in the centre , unrestrained . "
When Constable Burnett handed over the fine he said the driver " just looked at me blankly " .
" He did n't get it , " Constable Burnett said .
" I asked him about the fact the child was unrestrained and the beer was , and he said he did n't know anything about it . "
Superintendent Sean Parnell of Alice Springs police said the incident was a " timely reminder " to ensure " all passengers are secured " .

But a spokesman for the Ministry of Health said it did .
“ We will have to look into what is in the law , ” Nunes said .
Toby Keith is REALLY Rich
Country singerhas topped the Forbes list of highest earning country stars , bringing in a whopping $ 48 million in 2007 .

The country musician has an endorsement deal with Ford trucks and co-owns the restaurant chain I Love This Bar and Grill .
To further sweeten the pot , Toby owns his own record label , Show Dog Nashville .
Other country stars who are raking in the dough are Rascal Flatts at $ 40 million and Tim McGraw with earnings of $ 23 million .
The rest of the top 10 field include Kenny Chesney , Brooks & Dunn , Brad Paisley , Faith Hill , Keith Urban , George Strait and Alan Jackson .
The US army doubled its use of " moral waivers " for enlisted soldiers last year to cope with the stress of the Iraq war , allowing convicted sex offenders , people convicted of making terrorist threats and child abusers into the military , according to new records released today .
The army gave out 511 moral waivers to soldiers with felony convictions last year , relaxing its recruiting standards in order to admit them .
Criminals got 249 army waivers in 2006 , a sign that the high demand for US forces in Iraq has forced a sharp increase in the number of criminals allowed on the battlefield .
The felons accepted into the army and marines included 87 soldiers convicted of assault or maiming , 130 convicted of non-marijuana drug offences , seven convicted of making terrorist threats , and two convicted of indecent behaviour with a child .
Waivers were also granted to 500 burglars and thieves , 19 arsonists and 9 sex offenders .
The new data was released by the oversight committee of the House of Representatives , which also noted that " poor record - keeping and maintenance " prevented the military from tracking how many convicted criminals had received moral waivers before 2006 .
Henry Waxman , the Democratic chairman of the oversight panel , wrote to Pentagon personnel chief David Chu to seek more details on how directly the rise in waivers stems from Iraq - related recruiting needs .
Waxman told Chu that while " providing opportunities to individuals who have served their sentences and rehabilitated themselves " is important , the waivers are a sign that the US military is stretched too thin .
The total number of moral waivers in the military reached 34,476 in 2006 , or nearly 20 % of all enlisted soldiers , according to the Palm centre at the University of California .
Recruits with felony convictions are more likely than other soldiers to drop out or be released from the military , often at a significant cost to the US government .
More than one felony conviction disqualifies recruits from the army or marines , even with a moral waiver , but the navy and air force can admit those with multiple offences .
Still , the army and marines have stepped up their moral waivers while the navy and air force have cut down since the Iraq war began .

ruphus13 takes us to ZDNet for an analysis of comments by Microsoft 's Chief Software Architect , Ray Ozzie , about how open source is " much more potentially disruptive " to Microsoft 's business strategy than Google .
Ozzie also spoke about the future of Microsoft 's search technology , which will develop with or without Yahoo .
There is a related interview at OStatic with several Microsoft employees about how they view and interact with the open source community .
The head of Microsoft 's global open source and Linux team is quoted saying :
UNION CITY , California ( Reuters ) - Republican John McCain took aim at presidential rival Barack Obama ’s lack of military service on Thursday , drawing a rebuke from the Democratic front - runner for his “ endless diatribes and schoolyard taunts . ”
McCain ’s opposition to Senate legislation that would expand educational benefits for military veterans ignited a heated crossfire between the two White House contenders as they gear up for November ’s presidential election campaign .
McCain , a former Navy pilot and prisoner of war in Vietnam , reacted sharply after Obama criticized him for opposing the legislation .
The Arizona senator did not return to the Senate to vote on the measure , which passed easily .
“ I take a backseat to no one in my affection , respect and devotion to veterans , ” McCain said .
“ And I will not accept from Senator Obama , who did not feel it was his responsibility to serve our country in uniform , any lectures on my regard for those who did . ”
Obama , an Illinois senator who did not serve in the military , said he was proud to “ give our veterans the support and opportunity they deserve ” by voting for the bill .
He said in a statement he was disappointed by McCain ’s attack .
“ These endless diatribes and schoolyard taunts from the McCain campaign do nothing to advance the debate about what matters to the American people , ” Obama said .
The blistering exchange came as both candidates turn their attention to a likely match - up in November ’s presidential election .
McCain has clinched the Republican nomination , and Obama has moved within reach of the Democratic nomination .
Obama ’s remaining rival , Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York , has promised to stay in the race despite his nearly unassailable lead in delegates who will select the Democratic nominee at the August convention .
The legislation that sparked the exchange was sponsored by Virginia Democratic Sen. James Webb and Nebraska Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel , both military veterans .
McCain and the Bush administration said it was so generous it could encourage veterans to leave the military after one term to take advantage of the increased college benefits .
RESPECTS SERVICE
In his Senate speech , Obama said he respected McCain ’s military service “ but I ca n’t understand why he would line up behind the president in opposition . ”
McCain , who has stepped up his criticism of Obama but had not previously mentioned his lack of military service , said Obama had no right to criticize him on the issue .
“ It is typical , but no less offensive , that Senator Obama uses the Senate floor to take cheap shots at an opponent and easy advantage of an issue he has less than zero understanding of , ” McCain said .
The exchange came as McCain campaigned in California , where he rejected the endorsement of a Texas preacher after the pastor was discovered to have made derogatory comments about Jews .
“ Obviously , I find these remarks and others deeply offensive and indefensible , and I repudiate them , ” McCain said of the remarks by John Hagee .
“ I did not know of them before Reverend Hagee ’s endorsement , and I feel I must reject his endorsement as well . ”
McCain ’s statement came after The Huffington Post website reported on a late 1990s sermon Hagee gave in which he quoted from the Bible to make the argument that God ’s will had its influence on Nazism .
“ ‘ And they the hunters should hunt them , ’ that will be the Jews .
‘ From every mountain and from every hill and from out of the holes of the rocks . ’
If that does n’t describe what Hitler did in the Holocaust , you ca n’t see that , ” Hagee had said .
Democratic presidential candidate Senator Barack Obama speaks at a town hall meeting at the B'Nai Tora Congregation in Boca Raton , Florida , May 22 , 2008 .

McCain previously had distanced himself from Hagee , founder of Cornerstone Church of San Antonio , Texas , but still accepted his endorsement because of Hagee ’s influence with evangelical Christians .
McCain , 71 , plans to show a small group of reporters his medical records on Friday before he enjoys the Memorial Day holiday weekend at his Arizona vacation house with three potential vice presidential candidates -- Florida Gov. Charlie Crist , Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney .
Obama also has begun thinking about his potential vice presidential choice , asking Jim Johnson , the former chief executive of government mortgage giant Fannie Mae , to begin the search , TheAtlantic.com reported .
Johnson performed a similar role for Democratic candidates John Kerry in 2004 and Walter Mondale in 1984 .
McCain campaigned on Thursday in California ’s Silicon Valley , attending an economic discussion with California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and local business leaders .

Some say Clinton may have too much \ " baggage\ " to make an effective vice - presidential pick .
Can Clinton muscle to a VP nod ?
It is possible to muscle your way into a vice presidential nod :
You have something the nominee wants , and he has to give it to you .
The question is : Does Hillary Clinton have that kind of muscle ?
Advertisement
Her victories in states such as Ohio , Pennsylvania and West Virginia and her strength with women and white working - class voters have fueled the argument that Barack Obama must put her on the ticket if he wins the nomination and wants those states and those votes in the fall .
And , as a senior Obama adviser told me Wednesday , some Clinton supporters are “ pushing real , real hard to get her on the ticket . ”
But it wo n’t be easy .
“ You do n’t want your vice president taking away anything from the ticket , and she does , ” said the adviser , who asked not to be named because he was expressing his personal views and not the official view of the campaign .
The adviser cited two things against Clinton : the number of voters who consider Clinton “ dishonest ” and the “ baggage ” Clinton brings with her .
Last month , a Washington Post - ABC
News poll found that nearly six in 10 Americans believe Clinton is not “ honest and trustworthy . ”
“ That ’s not a real positive , ” the Obama adviser said , adding : “ Her baggage in a general election is real .
Does she bring women ?
No question .
But Barack Obama is not a turnoff for women . ”
He added : “ Keep in mind , we are talking about Democratic women .
That ’s who have been voting for her in the primaries .
Do you really think Democratic women are going to vote for John McCain in a general election with the Supreme Court at stake ? ”
But does n’t Clinton also attract certain groups of white voters that Obama has been unable to get ?
“ Yes , ” the adviser said , “ but some of them will never vote for Obama anyway . ”
Bruce Morrison disagrees with all of this .
He is a former congressman from Connecticut , went to Yale Law School with Hillary and Bill Clinton , was co-chairman of Irish - Americans for Clinton - Gore and has worked closely with Hillary Clinton on immigration issues .
He told me that if Obama wins the nomination , putting Clinton on the ticket just makes sense .
In fact , when Clinton was doing well earlier in the year , he urged her to put Obama on the ticket .
“ This is a race which is as close to a tie as anything we can recall , ” Morrison said .
“ The party is divided along certain sorts of measurable lines .
Different kinds of people are on different sides , and what the party needs is a merger . ”
But what about Clinton ’s “ baggage ” ?
“ Whatever baggage she has , it is obvious that people are supporting her in large numbers , ” Morrison said .
“ Her baggage is that she has taken slings and arrows for 20 years and is still standing . ”
Morrison added : “ When she says she is winning battleground states in primaries , that argument is relevant .
Putting her on the ticket makes it more likely for the ticket to win Pennsylvania , Ohio , Michigan and West Virginia in the general election . ”
The selection of a vice president is more than a cold calculation , however .
Part of the decision is about comfort level .
It is about the nominee asking : “ Do I want this person hanging around me for the next four or eight years ? ”
And , in the case of Hillary Clinton , it is also about asking : “ Do I want Bill Clinton hanging around me for the next four or eight years ? ”
Which is a question I put to Morrison .
“ I think Bill is a resource , ” Morrison said .
“ He can be unhelpful .
He has been , at times , unhelpful in this campaign .
But on the whole , he has been an enormous resource . ”
Morrison says putting Hillary Clinton on the ticket would have impact with voters .
She would , he says , bring “ white , working - class ” people to the ticket , “ the white ethnic voters ” with whom Bill Clinton did well in 1992 and 1996 and with whom Al Gore and John Kerry did not do so well in 2000 and 2004 .
Morrison does not diminish Obama ’s accomplishments .
“ We have two really spectacular candidates , ” he said .
“ They have stood up pretty well in a grueling battle for two years , and both are still standing .
Neither has knocked the other out , and one is winning in the stretch . ”
But Morrison said the choice of a vice president would be seen as Obama ’s “ first presidential decision , ” and picking Hillary Clinton would reflect “ the idea of bringing people together , the centerpiece of his campaign . ”

In the end , though , it will still be about muscle .

7 - inch screen for your PS3
Remember that cool 7 - inch screen that I showed you last week for the Wii ?
Well , for those with a PS3 that are jealous , do n’t worry , you ’ll be able to take your beloved console on the road with your own portable screen .
This screen is very similar to the one I showed you for the Wii .
It is the same size , features the ability to be mounted to either the console or another surface of your choosing .
It too will draw its power from your car ’s cigarette adapter .
What does set it apart ( aside from being black ) is that the screen is curved to hug the PS3 ’s body when not in use .
You ’ll also find a pair of detached speakers , which I ’m sure will come in handy .
No word on pricing .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Some travelers at key airports in New York and Los Angeles may be put through machines that see through clothing and provide a detailed image of a person 's body beginning later this week .
The TSA says the screener who reviews the images is in a booth , unable to see the travelers .
It 's the first expansion of the program since the machines were first put to the test in Phoenix , Arizona .
The " whole body imaging " machines have sparked complaints from privacy advocates .
But the Transportation Security Administration says that it has taken steps to protect individuals ' privacy and that 90 percent of the travelers in Phoenix preferred the imaging machine to a pat - down .
The millimeter wave machines will be rolled out at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York and Los Angeles International Airport in California later this week , TSA Administrator Kip Hawley told Congress on Tuesday .
The TSA will be purchasing at least 30 more machines for use at other U.S. airports this year , he added .
The TSA will use two different methods at JFK and LAX as they study the most effective way to use the machines .
Do n't Miss TSA.gov :
How the technology works
At JFK , passengers sent to secondary screening will be given the option of a pat - down or a trip through the body imager .
To protect the traveler 's privacy , the screener who reviews the image is in a booth , unable to see the traveler , according to the TSA .
The traveler 's face is pixilated and the image is not stored , the TSA said .
At LAX , the millimeter wave machine will be located just beyond the checkpoint magnetometers .
Travelers will continuously and randomly be selected to go through the machine .
While signs will inform them of the pat - down option , screeners will not announce that choice .
But passengers electing not to go through the millimeter wave machine will be given the option of the pat - down .
A TSA spokesman said the agency is still exploring backscatter , another imaging technology in use at Phoenix 's Sky Harbor International Airport .
Millimeter wave machines are already in use at airports in Britain , Spain , Japan , Australia , Mexico , Thailand and the Netherlands , as well as at some court and corrections facilities in Virginia , Colorado , Pennsylvania , California and Illinois .
Sky Harbor began using the machines last October .
Hawley also announced Tuesday the TSA is purchasing another 580 multi-view X - ray machines that are used to screen passengers ' carry - on bags , bringing the total to 830 machines .
The machines give screeners a clearer , more detailed view .
Some 600 machines will be deployed by year 's end , he said .
The technology is a " powerful platform " that can be adjusted to include software capable of detecting liquid explosives , he said .

Brazil has temporarily banned rice exports to protect its domestic supply and contain pressure on food prices .
Brazil will not meet orders from other Latin American countries and Africa for half a million tonnes of the grain .
Rice is a staple food in the diet of many Latin American countries and in Brazil its wholesale cost has been rising by nearly 1 per cent every day over the past month .
Brazil grows more rice than it consumes but the Government says the export ban is necessary to ensure domestic supply for the next six to eight months .
With international prices at record levels , local producers are keen to export and are warning the Government against jeopardising foreign contracts .
Brazil 's neighbour Argentina is also halting exports to contain local prices and just yesterday the Governments of Venezuela , Bolivia , Nicaragua and Cuba agreed on a $ 105 million plan to grow more food .
Japan has promised $ US100 million in emergency aid to help countries struggling with rising food prices .
A Japanese Government spokesman says the first $ US50 million will be distributed next month through the United Nations World Food Program , with most of it going to countries in Africa .
Japan has also pledged to put the food crisis on the agenda when it hosts the annual G8 summit in July .

Now Google and Yahoo will have to decide whether to move from test to broader partnership .
Talks around a deal were active Friday , even as Yahoo and Microsoft were engaged in a last - ditch effort to come to an agreement , said a person familiar with the discussions .
For Yahoo , the idea of letting Google run some of its search ads is not new .
Some shareholders and even some Yahoo executives have long favored it .
By the company ’s own reckoning , Google earns about 60 percent to 70 percent more on average for every search than Yahoo .
But before Microsoft made its offer , Mr. Yang and his team had repeatedly rejected the idea , saying search advertising was an essential part of the company ’s long - term strategy .
Instead , the company spent millions in improving its own search advertising system , called Panama , telling investors it was the right choice .
In a letter sent Saturday to Mr. Yang , Steven A. Ballmer , Microsoft ’s chief executive , used precisely those arguments to emphasize why a search advertising partnership with Google was a bad idea .
He also noted that it was one reason Microsoft decided to walk away from its offer , rather than initiate a proxy fight .
A partnership with Google “ would fundamentally undermine Yahoo ’s own strategy and long - term viability by encouraging advertisers to use Google as opposed to your Panama paid search system , ” Mr. Ballmer said .
“ This would also fragment your search advertising and display advertising strategies and the ecosystem surrounding them . ”
Yahoo and Google , however , are not talking about outsourcing all of Yahoo ’s search ads to Google .
Instead , they are considering a more limited partnership , under which Google would deliver ads only on particular searches for which the revenue difference is significant , according to people familiar with the discussions .
Analysts say such an arrangement could have multiple benefits .
It would allow Yahoo to retain Panama and even use the extra revenue it receives from Google to invest in its own ad system .
A limited partnership could help get around the antitrust scrutiny that a broader deal would most certainly face from regulators .
The Justice Department has already begun asking questions about the companies ’ relationships .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - About 300,000 U.S. troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan suffer symptoms of post - traumatic stress disorder or depression , but about half receive no care , an independent study said on Thursday .

The study by the RAND Corp. also estimated that another 320,000 troops have sustained a possible traumatic brain injury during deployment .
But researchers could not say how many of those cases were serious or required treatment .
Billed as the first large - scale nongovernmental survey of its kind , the study found that stress disorder and depression afflict 18.5 percent of the more than 1.5 million U.S. forces who have deployed to the two war zones .
The numbers are roughly in line with previous studies .
A February assessment by the U.S. Army that showed 17.9 percent of U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan suffering from acute stress , depression or anxiety in 2007 , down from 19.1 percent in 2006 .
But the 500 - page RAND study , based in part on interviews with more than 1,900 soldiers , sailors and Marines , also said that only half of troops suffering debilities receive care .
And in half of those cases , the care is only minimally adequate .
“ There is a major health crisis facing those men and women who have served our nation in Iraq and Afghanistan , ” said Terri Tanielian , a RAND researcher who helped head the study .
“ Unless they receive appropriate and effective care for these mental health conditions , there will be long - term consequences for them and for the nation . ”
FEAR OF STIGMA
The study said many service members do not seek treatment because they fear the stigma associated with psychological problems could harm their careers .
Post - traumatic stress disorder , or PTSD , can result from wartime trauma such as suffering wounds or witnessing others being hurt .
Symptoms include irritability or outbursts of anger , sleep difficulties , trouble concentrating , extreme vigilance and an exaggerated startle response .
RAND recommended that the Pentagon create a way for service members to receive mental health service confidentially and monitor the quality of care .
Army Col. Loree Sutton , director of the U.S. Defense Center of Excellence for Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury , welcomed the study .
She was concerned at the finding that only about half of those who sought help received “ minimally adequate ” treatment and said it would spur the military to try harder to recruit more mental health specialists .
The Army wants to hire 275 civilian mental health professionals but a tight labor market and difficulties getting civilians into war zones has slowed the effort , officials say .
RAND , a private research organization , estimated that stress and depression among returning soldiers cost $ 6.2 billion in the two years following deployment , mainly due to lost productivity , medical costs and a higher risk of suicide .

For more than a century , the Mississippi River has been one of the nation ’s most - important transportation corridors , a muddy , winding pathway for moving bulk commodities such as grain and coal and other goods .
Now , a New England startup company wants to harness the mighty river for a secondary purpose — generating electricity .
The company , Free Flow Power Corp. , is pursuing a $ 3 billion plan to install thousands of small electric turbines in the river bed , reaching from St. Louis to the Gulf of Mexico that would collectively generate 1,600 megawatts of electricity — enough to power 1.5 million homes .
Gloucester , Mass .- based Free Flow Power is one of a number of developers of so - called hydrokinetic projects , defined as those that produce electricity from river currents or ocean waves and tides — not dams .
Like the dozens of young companies building wind farms across the Great Plains or putting solar panels on roofs in California , interest in hydrokinetic projects is a response to a growing appetite for renewable energy as the nation tries to wean itself off crude oil and natural gas and reduce emissions of carbon dioxide , a heat - trapping gas linked to global warming .
“ Necessity is the mother of invention , and what ’s really driving this is the need to develop alternatives to fossil fuels , ” said Daniel R. Irvin , 48 , the company ’s chief executive .
Free Flow Power already has preliminary permits from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to study 59 sites on the river .
Each site would consist of hundreds or thousands of turbines installed over a stretch of several miles , according to permit applications filed with FERC , which regulates most of the nation ’s hydropower projects .
The turbines , which would be attached to pilings in the river bed , are about two feet in diameter and probably would be made of carbon fiber or another lightweight composite material , Irvin said .
The river ’s natural flow would spin the turbines to generate electricity , which would be transmitted to the power grid .
Free Flow Power chose the Mississippi River following a nationwide search in which it reviewed government data for 80,000 potential sites , looking for minimum average river flows of about 6.5 miles per hour .
The sites between St. Louis and New Orleans were among the best they found and also are near electricity markets in the Midwest and Southeast , Irvin said .
The FERC permits give Free Flow Power three years to complete detailed environmental and technical studies as well as the first right to seek operating licenses for projects at those locations .
Irvin , a former investment banker , is hopeful the company can begin producing electricity as soon as 2012 , though it may take five additional years to complete the build out .
To be sure , getting there wo n’t be easy .
The projects are likely to face close inspection by state and federal environmental regulators and the Army Corps of Engineers , which must assure the turbines do n’t interfere with river navigation .
There ’s also the potential impact to fish and wildlife habitat , including the pallid sturgeon , an endangered species native to the Missouri and Mississippi river basins .
In January , an official with the Missouri Department of Conservation urged FERC to require an environmental impact statement on the “ cumulative effects of proposed hydrokinetic power projects . ”
“ The department has serious reservations regarding the installation and operation of hydrokinetic power within the Mississippi River , ” Janet Sternberg , a policy coordinator for the department , said in a letter to FERC .
“ Little information is available regarding the environmental impacts of a single project , or the cumulative environmental impacts from 14 projects that may affect more than 74 miles of the river . ”
Irvin said he expects scrutiny and has reached out to state and federal regulators .
“ With a public resource like a river , there are a lot of concerns that need to be addressed , ” he said .
Another hurdle is cost .
Free Flow Power believes its projects can produce electricity at a price that ’s competitive with the output from natural - gas - fired plants .
“ This is not as cheap as conventional hydro , ” Irvin said .
“ But we ’re working hard to make it comparable with fossil fuels . ”
Free Flow Power and other developers of hydrokinetic projects are hopeful to be included in legislation approved by the U.S. House of Representatives that makes production tax credits available to wind power developers .
The measure would provide a tax credit per kilowatt hour that helps level the playing field with more - established generating technologies .
Free Flow Power sees scale as a key to its business plan to help hold down per-unit costs and improve economics .
“ To try to do a one - to five - megawatt site or a bunch of smaller ones is pretty much setting yourself up for failure , ” Irvin said .
The so - called “ in stream ” hydrokinetic projects being pursued by Free Flow Power represent just one of several new technologies being developed to take advantage of untapped energy sources .
Virginia - based Verdant Power began testing underwater turbines , resembling the large wind turbines sprouting up across the Midwest , in New York City ’s East River off New York in late 2006 as part of the Roosevelt Island Tidal Energy Project .
A larger commercial project is planned for Canada ’s St. Lawrence River .
Another company , Houston - based Hydro Green Energy LLC , also is pursuing projects in the Mississippi .
Still others are developing technologies that would generate electricity from ocean waves and tides .
“ There are some new technologies now that are being developed that we certainly have n’t thought about before , ” said Linda Church Ciocci , executive director of the National Hydropower Association in Washington .
These new technologies are the product of rising prices for conventional fuels such as oil and natural gas that help make emerging technologies more viable as well as state and federal policies that encourage the use of cleaner renewable energy .
Proposed hydrokinetic projects are just part of the untapped potential for hydropower , according to a 2007 study by the Electric Power Research Institute .
According to the study , the United States has the resource potential to develop an additional 23,000 megawatts of hydropower by 2025 , including 3,000 megawatts from new hydrokinetic technologies and 10,000 megawatts from ocean wave energy devices .

Two major stars of the Democratic foreign policy establishment -- former Sens. Sam Nunn and David Boren , have just endorsed Barack Obama and have agreed to serve on his national security team .
Nunn served as the Democratic Party 's coverman in foreign policy debates for two decades .
He voted against the 1991 Gulf War and thereby gave many other Democrats permission to take that political risk .
He 's a social conservative in many respects , too .
More recently , Nunn has associated himself with the cause of nuclear nonproliferation .
He spent 8 years as chairman of the Armed Services committee in the Senate .
Boren left the Senate in 1994 and is a former chairman of what used to be called the Senate Select Committee on intelligence .
He also spent 4 years as governor of Oklahoma .
In the statements they provided to the Obama campaign , both Nunn and Boren sound Obama - esque notes .
Here 's Nunn : " Demonizing the opposition , oversimplifying the issues , and dumbing down the political debate prevent our country from coming together to make tough decisions and tackle our biggest challenges . "
Here 's Boren : " “ Our most urgent task is to end the divisions in our country , to stop the political bickering , and to unite our talents and efforts .
Americans of all persuasions are pleading with our political leaders to bring us together .
I believe Senator Obama is sincerely committed to that effort .
He has made a non-partisan approach to all issues a top priority . "
Last summer , Boren held private talks with associates of Mayor Mike Bloomberg about a possible independent presidential bid .
Just asking : who was the latest major figure to endorse Hillary Clinton ?

Encryption Chip Will End Piracy , Says Atari Founder
" There is a stealth encryption chip called a TPM that is going on the motherboards of most of the computers that are coming out now , " explained Bushnell , according to a GamesIndustry report .
" What that says is that in the games business we will be able to encrypt with an absolutely verifiable private key in the encryption world -- which is uncrackable by people on the internet and by giving away passwords -- which will allow for a huge market to develop in some of the areas where piracy has been a real problem . "
Piracy has been a hot - button issue in the PC gaming industry for some time now , with renowned PC developers such as Crytek , id , and Epic claiming that the high rate of pirated PC software forced them to put games on other platforms .
" I 've seen studios close as the result of it , I 've seen people lose their homes , " former Ritual QA manager Mike Russell told Shacknews while discussing the effects of piracy .
" I guess I 'm more vocal than a lot of people because I 've seen the personal side of it , and it 's just sad that we have so many people looking for a way of justifying it . "
Bushnell suggested that though movie and music piracy will likely continue unabated , game markets made previously inaccessible due to piracy issues will begin to flourish as the chip 's install base grows .
" Games are a different thing , because games are so integrated with the code .
The TPM will , in fact , absolutely stop piracy of gameplay , " he noted .
" As soon as the installed base of the TPM hardware chip gets large enough , we will start to see revenues coming from Asia and India at a time when before it did n't make sense . "
After founding Atari and making Pong a household name , Bushnell went on to create the Chuck E. Cheese franchise , which mixed pizza eateries with arcades and animatronic stage performances .
Since then , he has moved away from the mainstream video game industry , and recently went so far as to label modern games " pure , unadulterated trash . "
What humans find attractive is largely based on symmetry .
The more symmetrical a face is , the more appealing it appears to others .
But there ’s not much we can do , short of surgery , to change the symmetry of our faces .
There are ways to mitigate our asymmetries , however .
You may have heard a woman in your life talk about getting a haircut that flatters her particular face shape .
While dude ’s haircuts do n’t come in enough varieties to have the same effect , there is another way guys can balance out their faces : hats .
All hats make a man look more dapper .
But picking a hat that is right for your face shape will increase your attractiveness and give you a sharper appearance .
If you ’ve been inspired to bring back the hat , but were n’t sure what kind of hat to get , this guide will help you pick the right hat for your ugly mug .
Anatomy of a Hat
Before we get started , let ’s do a quick rundown of some of the terms we ’ll be using to fit a hat to your mug .
“ Taper ” describes how narrow the top of the crown is compared to the bottom .
Now let ’s match a hat to that ugly mug of yours :
Short , Full Face
Your face is shaped like : Jack Black
A round face tends to look short , so you want a hat that will give you a little height .
Crown : Medium height and size
Taper : Slight
Hat Band : Narrow band of a contrasting color will add height
Brim : Moderate width .
Snap the brim to its full width and turn it up .

Pulling It All Together : Matching Your Clothes with Your Hat
You can wear a hat any old time , with any outfit , of any color .
But when you want to look particularly sharp , make sure your hat color complements your suit or outfit .
The Brown Hat
Brown hats look best with brown or green suits or coats .
If wearing a dark blue or dark gray suit , a dark brown hat may also look acceptable .
The Gray Hat
Gray hats are quite versatile and can be paired with black , blue , and dark gray suits and coats .
The Blue Hat
Wear a blue hat with a blue or gray suit or coat .
If pairing a blue suit with a blue hat , the colors must match fairly closely .
Alternatively , you can pair a dark blue suit with a light blue hat or vice versa .
You can also get away with wearing a blue hat with a light brown or tan suit .
The Green Hat
Green hats are surprisingly versatile .
They look best with tan or light brown suits .
But they also accent black , green , and gray suits very nicely .
It ’s practical to use Amazon ’s Simple Storage Service ( S3 ) as the backend for a web application WITHOUT any intervening application server .
I have the code to prove it and I ’m sharing it .
If you ’re a nerd , read on otherwise you may want to skip this post
S3 clearly was designed to for use with an application server between browser and desktop applications and the actual data store .
To Amazon ’s credit , that server does n’t have to be Amazon ’s Elastic Computing Cloud ( although pricing somewhat favors this ) .
The Getting Started Guide , for example , gives examples only in PHP , C# , Java , Perl , Ruby and Python because they assume that you ’ll be using one of those languages on a server .
The implication is that you ca n’t do it in JavaScript / AJAX – but you can .
The Developers Guide also gives short shrift to JavaScript .
It does explain that you can let “ your users ” upload certain data directly ( bypassing your server ) through HTML forms although it assumes that access keys will be delivered to the browser by a server just prior to upload for all non-trivial cases .
There is a also a description of a way to prepackage a very specific authorized retrieval request so that the browser can get data directly from S3 – but , again , the assumption is that the browser first asks “ mother may I ? ” and receives a specific and time - limited key from the server before making an XMLHttpRequest GET .
My application – broadbandwiki – lets users put pins on a map in order to indicate what type of Internet access they have available at their locations .
S3 is the place that the locations , access types , and access providers are remembered .
Google ’s examples assume that , if you want to save the locations you gather with an application like this , you ’ll have a LAMP stack operating on a server somewhere .
They give good examples of the PHP and mySQL you ’d use to do this .
My problems were both that I do n’t have a server on which to run said LAMP stack and I would have to learn a lot about Linux , Apache , mySQL , and PHP .
The first problem could easily be solved by any of a number of hosting services including EC2 ; but all the learning seemed a lot to wade into when I just wanted to store a little data and have access to it later .
Probably ended up being harder to get S3 to do what I wanted than if I ’d just swallowed my medicine and learned the server - side stuff but I got stubborn .
The good news is that , once you know the tricks , this is easy .
Here ’s the main thing you need to know even though the documentation does n’t say it .
XMLHttpRequest works for not only GET but also PUT and DELETE ( That ’s all I ’ve tested ) .
I did n’t need PUT and DELETE in the user application but I did need them in the batch - like administrator application .
Note that the administrator application does all sorts of privileged stuff but it can still be run safely in a browser because the Amazon Secret ID is supplied by the administrator at run time .
It is used to develop a time - limited hash key on the administrator ’s computer but the secret key itself is NEVER transmitted .
Note that XMLHttpRequest is usually limited to making requests from the same domain as the web page was served from and this is no exception .
The solution is to host the web page on your Amazon S3 account ( it ’s got to live somewhere , anyway ) so that there is no cross -domain violation .
However , the page hosted on Amazon can be in a frame of a page hosted elsewhere if that ’s important to the look and feel of what you ’re doing .
Sample code for the administrator app ( which borrows liberally from every other bit of sample code I could find ) is here .
It wo n’t run for you until you have an Amazon S3 account and fix the places where I bound the name of my own bucket on S3 in the code but it is meant to provide an example of how to use XMLHttpRequests with S3 .
It is NOT a sample of clean , well - documented code , however ; it ’s a work in progress .
It also needs more functionality and more error checking so I will post later versions as I clean it up .
Next nerd post on this subject will be on how to let browser users write data , some of which is meant to be seen by other browser users and some of which is n’t – all without a server of your own .
Once I have done some cleaning up and packaging , I ’ll also post the user application although all you good hackers know you can already get it just by downloading it from its web address or viewing source in a browser .
WITH no end to the ongoing food crisis in sight , experts are doing their best to understand the root causes of soaring prices .
Steady growth in global demand is obviously a factor , as are weather disruptions , and biofuel production and subsidies have come under ( deserved ) attack , as well .
These explanations account for much of the current situation , but surprisingly little ink has been spilled in the western media on the looming breakdown in food trade .
Rising food prices in many Asian nations have placed governments under pressure , and their response , increasingly , has been to curb or halt exports of food crops .
China , India , Vietnam , Egypt , Indonesia , and Kazakhstan have all taken measures to reduce or stop foreign sales of grains -- primarily rice , but also wheat .
This is distressing .
It 's immediate impact is to harm nations that previously imported food from the now closed markets .
Middle eastern countries , in particular , have found themselves searching frantically for new suppliers as the restrictions have come down .
Each new export restriction complicates matters for other exporters , as well .
The reduction in available food supply increases demand pressures on their export crops , pushing up prices and boosting calls for similar export restrictions .
The result is a panic , familiar territory in financial markets but slightly novel in the global food trade .
It 's difficult to imagine America or Europe taking similar steps .
Still , as the stock of remaining exporters shrinks , prices to domestic consumers in those places will continue to soar , and it will no doubt be difficult to meet domestic demand and calls for food assistance elsewhere .
Over the long - term , bigger questions loom .
If nations are so quick to protect domestic food stocks , will they not also respond similarly to rising energy prices ?
What will happen in a nation with export restrictions if domestic crops fail ?
And will this result in a worldwide move to increased self - sufficiency , forcing economies to allocate resources away from more productive pursuits and toward agriculture ?
It 's in no one 's interest to see global trade in food products collapse .
The gains from trade are immense , and the potential pain of increased food prices and famine resulting from export restrictions is significant .
It would be nice to see global leadership on this issue coming from Europe or America .
Efforts must be made to restore confidence in food trade and re-open closed markets .
I 'm currently training for a marathon .
When I 'm on a long training run and start to think , " This is stupid ... " 
I do n't stop and remind myself why I 'm trying to run a 26.2 - mile race .
I prefer to comfort myself with " Yeah , but it 's nowhere near as crazy as ... "  and then fill in a truly absurd feat of human endurance that makes 26.2 miles look positively meager .
Here are some favorites :
1. The Barkley Marathons
When assassin James Earl Ray escaped from a Tennessee prison in 1977 , he was missing for 55 hours .
In that time , he only managed to get eight miles away before being recaptured .
Race organizer Gary Cantrell heard this statistic and thought he could make it at least a hundred miles in that time .
He organized the Barkley Marathons to test this theory .
Since 1986 , elite ultramarathon runners have met in the hills of Frozen Head State Park to have a go at one of the world 's most difficult races .
Cantrell handpicks the field according to his own whims and applicants ' essays on why they should be allowed to run the Barkley .
Marathoners have 60 hours to complete five 20 - mile loops through the park .
Each loop contains over 10,000 feet of vertical climb , and if any loop takes more than 12 hours , the runner is disqualified .
The runners trudge along through brambles , unmarked trails , and occasionally both snow and blistering heat during the same race .
Do n't think that 100 miles in 60 hours sounds so tough ?
Since the race 's inception over 500 elite runners have tried to finish the 100 - mile trek .
Seven have successfully finished the race .
Cantrell 's not a total sadist , though ; he also offers a companion " fun run "  to go along with his monstrous trail run .
Fun runners only have to finish 60 miles of the course in 40 hours .
Sounds like a lot of fun , right ?
2. Badwater Ultramarathon
The Barkley Marathons have some competition for the title of " World 's Toughest Race , "  though .
The idea behind the Badwater Ultramarathon is fairly simple : when it 's really hot , it 's tough to do anything active , much less run 135 hilly miles .
Starting in 1987 , though , devoted runners have been trying to make a dash from the Badwater Basin in Death Valley to the Whitney Portal , Mount Whitney 's trailhead , each July .
That 's right , Death Valley in July .
Temperatures have been known to reach 120 degrees in the shade , and runners have been known to run on the white lines on the side of the road to keep the soles of their shoes from melting .
The elevation gain in the race is similarly brutal .
The race was originally conceived as a trip between the lowest and highest points of the continental U.S. Runnes would head from Badwater ( 282 feet below sea level ) to the summit of Mount Whitney ( 14,496 feet ) .
However , the current race " only "  goes to Mount Whitney 's trailhead due to Forest Service regulations on climbing the mountain .
And that does n't even take into account the pair of mountain ranges in between the two points .
Runners , who must be invited to participate , have 60 hours to complete the course , and usually 60 - 80 % of them do .
Some finish much , much faster , though .
Last year Brazilian Valmir Nunes destroyed the course record in his first race ; he made the trek in just 22 hours and 51 minutes .
3. Furnace Creek 508
This race , started in 1989 , is the cycling equivalent of Badwater .
Starting in just north of Los Angeles in Santa Clarita , CA , cyclists take off through Death Valley and the Mojave Desert in this 508 - mile race .
Entrants have 48 hours to finish the course , which includes 36,000 feet of elevation gain .
For perspective , that 's like riding four mountain stages of the Tour de France back - to - back without stopping .
Interestingly , organizers of the event eschew the typical practice of giving each racer a number , opting instead to give entrants animal " totems "  by which they can be identified .
The totem presumably gives cyclists a head start on picking an animal to hallucinate after spending two grueling days on the saddle of a bike .
4. Race Across America
If pedaling through Death Valley sounds a bit soft , perhaps the Race Across America is tough enough for you .
This ultra marathon bike race is exactly what the title makes it out to be ; racers get on their bikes in and ride from the West Coast to the East Coast .
It bills itself as " The World 's Toughest Bike Race . " 
The race , which began in 1982 , is even more strenuous than most long bike tours .
Unlike , say , the Tour de France or other races of its kind , there are no stages or designated times to stop and rest in most divisions of the race .
Once the clock starts at the beginning of the race , it does n't pause until entrants start trickling across the finish line .
Consequently , there 's a lot of pressure to keep riding throughout the night without getting adequate sleep .
The time limit for the event is 12 days , so riders can't average more than 4 hours of sleep a day and expect to finish .
The course changes each year , but the winner usually rolls in around eight or nine days after the race starts .
Some years 50 % of entrants fail to finish due to exhaustion or medical distress .
This year 's race starts June 8 and will cover 3000 miles between Oceanside , CA and Annapolis , MD .
One of the race website 's FAQs compares the event to the Tour de France or climbing Mt. Everest .
The Tour de France comparisons are brushed aside ; this race is 50 % longer and does n't allow drafting or team tactics .
On the topic of Everest , the site speaks for itself : " Mt. Everest and the Race Across America are entirely different .
Austrian adventurer Wolfgang Fasching has won solo RAAM three times and climbed Mt. Everest .
In his opinion , - Everest is more dangerous , but RAAM is much harder . " 
5. Manhattan Island Marathon Swim
Running and cycling are n't the only sports that lend themselves to feats of absurd endurance .
Swimmers looking for a ridiculously difficult even need look no further than the annual Manhattan Island Marathon Swim .
Each year a small handful of intrepid individuals meet in New York and brave the waters of the East , Hudson , and Harlem Rivers to circumnavigate giant loop around Manhattan .
The course is 28.5 miles long , and takes over seven hours to complete .
While continuously swimming for seven - plus hours would be impressive under any circumstances , these athletes have to deal with boats , pollution , and what the event 's website describes as " random jetsam and flotsam in the waterways . " 
Probably best not to think about what said jetsam and flotsam might be .
To make things tougher , wetsuits are n't allowed , either .
The event is popular , though .
When it began in 1982 , only 12 people swam the race ; last year there were 90 entrants .
Due to strong currents and dirty water that hinders visibility , each solo swimmer needs a guide in a kayak or motorboat to steer them in the right direction .
There are also unexpected problems .
A hard rain during the race can make Manhattan 's antiquated sewage system back up into the river , which lead to cancellations in 2003 and 2005 .
6. Colac Six Day Race
As if the aforementioned examples did n't seem challenging enough , a certain small subset of ultramarathon runners have taken on the challenge of multiday races that go beyond the ones listed here .
Take , for instance , the Colac Six Day Race .
Instead of seeing who can go the fastest on a given course , runners meet up most years in Colac , Australia , and see who can run the most laps around a 440 m track .
Sure , there are no hills , but the scenery never changes , either .
Just six days of running in circles around a track .
The static environment does n't slow down the competitors , though .
In 2005 Greece 's Yiannis Kouros , possibly the world 's greatest ultra runner , broke the world distance record for such an event by going 1036.80 kilometers in the six days .
He needed some help from his competition , though ; according to the event 's website , Vlastk Skvaril generously gave Kouros his ice vest to help lower his blood temperature when it started to get too high .
What these events lack in mainstream appeal , they make up for in sportsmanship and ownership of frozen vests .

Experts say terror groups are unlikely to use games such as World of Warcraft
The US government has begun a project to develop ways to spot terrorists who are using virtual worlds .
Codenamed Reynard it aims to recognise " normal " behaviour in online worlds and home in on anomalous activity .
It is likely to develop tools and techniques for intelligence officers who are hunting terrorists and terror groups on the net or in virtual worlds .
The project was welcomed by experts tracking terror groups using the net to organise or carry out attacks .
Growing threat
Brief details about Reynard came to light in a report sent to the US Congress by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence ( ODNI ) - which co-ordinates the work of US intelligence agencies .
We can see groups emerging in cyber spaces and virtual communities that would be wholly virtual
Roderick Jones , Concentric Solutions
iPM : Listen to the interview with anti-terror experts
In that report , which talked about the data mining efforts undertaken by the ODNI , Reynard was described as : " a seedling effort to study the emerging phenomenon of social ( particularly terrorist ) dynamics in virtual worlds and large - scale online games and their implications for the intelligence community " .
Using publicly available data Reynard researchers will carry out observational studies to establish " baseline normative behaviors " .
Once these are identified , Reynard will " then apply the lessons learned to determine the feasibility of automatically detecting suspicious behavior and actions in the virtual world " .
" It 's a positive step , " said Andrew Cochran , founder and co-chairman of the Counterterrorism Foundation .
" For a number of years we were behind in chasing jihadists ' presence on the net and detecting it . "
" That 's a very sensible step at the moment , " said Roderick Jones , a vice president of Concentric Solutions and a former special branch officer .
" Just to feel their way around them and work out what new intelligence collection methods might be required to deal with this threat , because you wo n't be able to use traditional law enforcement methods . "
New worlds
A senior intelligence officer at the ODNI said Reynard was in its very early stages and it was too soon to say which online worlds it would be studying .
He added that any work on it would be purely for research rather than " operational " purposes .
Many terror groups indulge in cyber crime to fund their activities
" I think its highly unlikely terrorists would use things like Second Life or World of Warcraft as they do not have the necessary security , " said Mr Jones .
" Terrorist use of the internet at the moment relies on password protected forums , " he added .
Said Mr Cochran : " All of the major terrorist treatises have been distributed through the internet so taking it to a virtual world with multi-player role games is really an easy step . "
It was inevitable that terror groups would make greater use of the internet and the possibilities that virtual spaces offered them , said Mr Jones .
" There 's more a chance of things like Jihad worlds coming online in the next five years I think , " he said .
The visual richness of virtual worlds made them good places to educate recruits about techniques , said Mr Jones .
Attack pattern
" We can see groups emerging in cyber spaces and virtual communities that would be wholly virtual , " he said .
" They would organise and radicalise in virtual worlds and attack using cyber methods without becoming a real world presence in any real way . "
Many groups were likely to use the expertise and skills they learn in virtual worlds to target key net systems .
Ken Silva , chief technology officer for Verisign which oversees some of the net 's core address books , said such an attack could be " devastating " .
" We see a continuing growth in the amount of horsepower in the attacks that are directed at infrastructure servers , " said Mr Silva .
A router problem made YouTube inaccessible for many
" We are seeing a large shift from attacks that are directed at individual websites , " he said .
" The sophistication is getting a little smarter and they are attacking the infrastructure pieces behind them ... , which is typically in most production environments the least invested in . "
Some of the basic systems of the net , such as the Border Gateway Protocol ( BGP ) which helps data reach its intended destination , were open to attack .
An accidental misconfiguration of BGP in some routers in Pakistan caused the recent problems with YouTube which left many people unable to reach the video site .
" BGP is essentially a relatively unprotected protocol and is seriously vulnerable to disruption , " he said .
" Should that happen , it could take a very long time to correct that situation . "
" This has to be fought at every level , " he said .
Google has announced a formalized program to help cities who would like to organize a project to have their cities put into Google Earth in 3D .
There have already been many cities ( especially in Germany ) who have taken it upon themselves to develop 3D models of their cities and coordinate with Google to put their models into Google Earth .
See for example : Dresden , Hamburg , Westport ( Ireland ) , Las Vegas , and Beaver Creek ( Colorado ) .
When GE was first released by Google , they included over 30 cities in US with plain grey buildings .
Then when Google Earth 4 was released with photo texture capabilities , Google built some sample cities like Boulder and Denver , Colorado with the new capabilities , hoping more cities would be added by others , and encouraged people to submit their own buildings .
Google ’s new web site to encourage city managers to participate in the 3D cities program points out that the resulting data can easily be shared for urban planning , real estate development , tourism , and more .
Google will , of course , encourage the use of Google SketchUp for the model building .
Google will also assist to make sure the cities build the models with the right criteria to make sure they get included in Google Earth ’s layers .
By the way , I think having at least your most significant buildings added to Google Earth in 3D is a very good idea .
It helps give potential visitors a better perspective of your city and gives you an opportunity to entice more tourism and business .
Google Earth is by far the most popular 3D geo browser on the planet , so its important to use this avenue to market your city .
While Google is trying to get cities to develop 3D models of their buildings themselves , Microsoft has taken a different approach .
Microsoft has been investing millions of dollars to have all new custom aerial photography of cities all over the world .
In addition to the normal straight - down aerial imagery , they also fly their planes in a grid pattern and take photos at 45 degree ( oblique ) angles such that they get images in four different directions of all buildings in a city .
These are the Bird ’s Eye Views you can see in Virtual Earth .
These images are also used to automatically generate 3D buildings .
And so , Microsoft Virtual Earth already has dozens of cities already modeled in 3D ( see the 20 or so just released in February for example ) .
While the fidelity ( resolution ) of the 3D data may not be as high in VE as building the models by hand , the number of buildings modeled is quite high – and it takes a lot fewer people to do the work .
Virtual Earth is not nearly as popular – so there are much fewer people who are likely to browse your city with it .
But , to get your entire city modeled for free is a good deal .
And , as Microsoft gets more and more cities modeled , and enhances their interfaces , the popularity of the application will go up .
Last spring I wrote a comparison between Virtual Earth and Google Earth – especially as it relates to the 3D buildings .
About Frank Taylor Frank Taylor started the Google Earth Blog in July , 2005 shortly after Google Earth was first released .
He has worked with 3D computer graphics and VR for many years and was very impressed with this exciting product .

BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - The U.S. military said on Sunday it had evidence Iranian - backed Shi’ite militias in Iraq were increasingly using secret weapons stores to attack U.S. and Iraqi forces .
The accusation comes days after Tehran postponed talks with the United States on improving security in Iraq for “ technical reasons ” , a move that prompted rebukes from U.S. officials .
“ In just the past week , Iraqi and coalition forces captured 212 weapons caches across Iraq , two of those inside Baghdad , ( which have ) growing links to Iranian - backed special groups , ” military spokesman Real Admiral Gregory Smith told reporters .
The military uses the term “ special groups ” to describe rogue elements in the Mehdi Army militia of Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al - Sadr .
It says these militants get weapons , funding and training from neighboring Iran .
Smith was speaking at a news conference in which he lauded recent security gains in Iraq , adding that on some days attacks had dropped to below 40 a day , the lowest level since 2004 .
Highlighting the fragility of the gains , a female suicide bomber killed at least three people in central Baghdad , police said .
The U.S. military said only the bomber was killed .
Two U.S. soldiers were also killed by insurgents in Diyala province northeast of Baghdad , the military said .
Washington , at loggerheads with Shi’ite Iran over its nuclear plans , accuses Tehran of destabilizing Iraq by arming Shi’ite groups .
Iran denies the accusations and blames the U.S. - led invasion of Iraq in 2003 for the violence .
Smith said there was no evidence of increased arms shipments to Iraq from Iran , but added that Iranian - backed groups were increasingly using secret stores of weapons to launch attacks .
“ What we ’re seeing is an increase in the use of weapons by Iranian - backed special groups , ” he said , adding the number of weapons caches found in January was the largest in a year .
BITTER ENEMIES
The U.S. - Iranian security talks are one of the few forums in which officials from the two bitter foes have direct contact .
Diplomatic ties have been frozen for almost three decades .
Iran ’s Foreign Ministry said technical reasons were behind the delay in talks between Iranian and U.S. officials in Baghdad , but did not elaborate .
Tehran on Thursday postponed what would have been a fourth round of discussions .
David Satterfield , the U.S. State Department ’s Iraq coordinator , said on Friday Iran was “ intent on continuing to promote violence within Iraq ” .
Violence has fallen 60 percent across Iraq since 30,000 additional U.S. troops became fully deployed in June .
Vital to better security has been a decision by Sunni Arab tribal leaders to turn against Sunni Islamist al Qaeda , and form groups to drive them out .
The U.S. - backed groups , called concerned local citizens ( CLCs ) by the military , have 80,000 men across Iraq .
They man checkpoints and provide intelligence on militant hideouts .

But cracks have appeared in ties with U.S. and Iraqi forces .
One CLC group said it was suspending its activities after three members were killed in an incident near the town of Jurf al - Sukr , south of Baghdad on Friday .
The unit blamed U.S. soldiers for the deaths .
The U.S. military said attack helicopters had responded with rockets after security forces came under small - arms fire .
Smith said any incidents were investigated .
“ Coalition forces are working with CLCs to bring about security .
They are certainly not targeting CLCs , ” he said .
In the southern city of Basra , a CBS News journalist continued to be held by kidnappers after being captured a week ago .
Efforts to free the Briton , who has not been named , were being held up over talks about how he should be released , negotiators said .
The World Beyond Iraq
Senator Barack Obama
March 19 , 2008
As prepared for delivery
Just before America 's entry into World War I , President Woodrow Wilson addressed Congress : " It is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war , " he said .
" ... But the right is more precious than peace . "
Wilson 's words captured two awesome responsibilities that test any Commander - in - Chief – to never hesitate to defend America , but to never go to war unless you must .
War is sometimes necessary , but it has grave consequences , and the judgment to go to war can never be undone .
Five years ago today , President George W. Bush addressed the nation .
Bombs had started to rain down on Baghdad .
War was necessary , the President said , because the United States could not , " live at the mercy of an outlaw regime that threatens the peace with weapons of mass murder . "
Recalling the pain of 9/11 , he said the price of inaction in Iraq was to meet the threat with " armies of fire fighters and police and doctors on the streets of our cities . "
At the time the President uttered those words , there was no hard evidence that Iraq had those stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction .
There was not any evidence that Iraq was responsible for the attacks of September 11 , or that Iraq had operational ties to the al Qaeda terrorists who carried them out .
By launching a war based on faulty premises and bad intelligence , President Bush failed Wilson 's test .
So did Congress when it voted to give him the authority to wage war .
Five years have gone by since that fateful decision .
This war has now lasted longer than World War I , World War II , or the Civil War .
Nearly four thousand Americans have given their lives .
Thousands more have been wounded .
Even under the best case scenarios , this war will cost American taxpayers well over a trillion dollars .
And where are we for all of this sacrifice ?
We are less safe and less able to shape events abroad .
We are divided at home , and our alliances around the world have been strained .
The threats of a new century have roiled the waters of peace and stability , and yet America remains anchored in Iraq .
History will catalog the reasons why we waged a war that did n't need to be fought , but two stand out .
In 2002 , when the fateful decisions about Iraq were made , there was a President for whom ideology overrode pragmatism , and there were too many politicians in Washington who spent too little time reading the intelligence reports , and too much time reading public opinion .
The lesson of Iraq is that when we are making decisions about matters as grave as war , we need a policy rooted in reason and facts , not ideology and politics .
Now we are debating who should be our next Commander in Chief .
And I am running for President because it 's time to turn the page on a failed ideology and a fundamentally flawed political strategy , so that we can make pragmatic judgments to keep our country safe .
That 's what I did when I stood up and opposed this war from the start , and said that we needed to finish the fight against al Qaeda .
And that 's what I 'll do as President of the United States .
Senator Clinton says that she and Senator McCain have passed a " Commander in Chief test " – not because of the judgments they 've made , but because of the years they 've spent in Washington .
She made a similar argument when she said her vote for war was based on her experience at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue .
But here is the stark reality : there is a security gap in this country – a gap between the rhetoric of those who claim to be tough on national security , and the reality of growing insecurity caused by their decisions .
A gap between Washington experience , and the wisdom of Washington 's judgments .
A gap between the rhetoric of those who tout their support for our troops , and the overburdened state of our military .
It is time to have a debate with John McCain about the future of our national security .
And the way to win that debate is not to compete with John McCain over who has more experience in Washington , because that 's a contest that he 'll win .
The way to win a debate with John McCain is not to talk , and act , and vote like him on national security , because then we all lose .
The way to win that debate and to keep America safe is to offer a clear contrast , and that 's what I will do when I am the nominee of the Democratic Party – because since before this war in Iraq began , I have made different judgments , I have a different vision , and I will offer a clean break from the failed policies and politics of the past .
Nowhere is that break more badly needed than in Iraq .
In the year since President Bush announced the surge – the bloodiest year of the war for America – the level of violence in Iraq has been reduced .
Our troops – including so many from Fort Bragg and Pope Air Force Base – have done a brilliant job under difficult circumstances .
Yet while we have a General who has used improved tactics to reduce violence , we still have the wrong strategy .
As General Petraeus has himself acknowledged , the Iraqis are not achieving the political progress needed to end their civil war .
Beyond Iraq , our military is badly overstretched , and we have neither the strategy nor resources to deal with nearly every other national security challenge we face .
This is why the judgment that matters most on Iraq – and on any decision to deploy military force – is the judgment made first .
If you believe we are fighting the right war , then the problems we face are purely tactical in nature .
That is what Senator McCain wants to discuss – tactics .
What he and the Administration have failed to present is an overarching strategy : how the war in Iraq enhances our long - term security , or will in the future .
That 's why this Administration cannot answer the simple question posed by Senator John Warner in hearings last year :
Are we safer because of this war ?
And that is why Senator McCain can argue – as he did last year – that we could n't leave Iraq because violence was up , and then argue this year that we can't leave Iraq because violence is down .
When you have no overarching strategy , there is no clear definition of success .
Success comes to be defined as the ability to maintain a flawed policy indefinitely .
Here is the truth : fighting a war without end will not force the Iraqis to take responsibility for their own future .
And fighting in a war without end will not make the American people safer .
So when I am Commander - in - Chief , I will set a new goal on Day One : I will end this war .
Not because politics compels it .
Not because our troops cannot bear the burden– as heavy as it is .
But because it is the right thing to do for our national security , and it will ultimately make us safer .
In order to end this war responsibly , I will immediately begin to remove our troops from Iraq .
We can responsibly remove 1 to 2 combat brigades each month .
If we start with the number of brigades we have in Iraq today , we can remove all of them 16 months .
After this redeployment , we will leave enough troops in Iraq to guard our embassy and diplomats , and a counter - terrorism force to strike al Qaeda if it forms a base that the Iraqis cannot destroy .
What I propose is not – and never has been – a precipitous drawdown .
It is instead a detailed and prudent plan that will end a war nearly seven years after it started .
My plan to end this war will finally put pressure on Iraq 's leaders to take responsibility for their future .
Because we 've learned that when we tell Iraq 's leaders that we 'll stay as long as it takes , they take as long as they want .
We need to send a different message .
We will help Iraq reach a meaningful accord on national reconciliation .
We will engage with every country in the region – and the UN – to support the stability and territorial integrity of Iraq .
And we will launch a major humanitarian initiative to support Iraq 's refugees and people .
But Iraqis must take responsibility for their country .
It is precisely this kind of approach – an approach that puts the onus on the Iraqis , and that relies on more than just military power – that is needed to stabilize Iraq .
Let me be clear : ending this war is not going to be easy .
There will be dangers involved .
We will have to make tactical adjustments , listening to our commanders on the ground , to ensure that our interests in a stable Iraq are met , and to make sure that our troops are secure .
Senator Clinton has tried to use my position to score political points , suggesting that I am somehow less committed to ending the war .
She makes this argument despite the fact that she has taken the same position in the past .
So ask yourself : who do you trust to end a war – someone who opposed the war from the beginning , or someone who started opposing it when they started preparing a run for President ?
Now we know what we 'll hear from those like John McCain who support open - ended war .
They will argue that leaving Iraq is surrender .
That we are emboldening the enemy .
These are the mistaken and misleading arguments we hear from those who have failed to demonstrate how the war in Iraq has made us safer .
Just yesterday , we heard Senator McCain confuse Sunni and Shiite , Iran and al Qaeda .
Maybe that is why he voted to go to war with a country that had no al Qaeda ties .
Maybe that is why he completely fails to understand that the war in Iraq has done more to embolden America 's enemies than any strategic choice that we have made in decades .
The war in Iraq has emboldened Iran , which poses the greatest challenge to American interests in the Middle East in a generation , continuing its nuclear program and threatening our ally , Israel .
Instead of the new Middle East we were promised , Hamas runs Gaza , Hizbollah flags fly from the rooftops in Sadr City , and Iran is handing out money left and right in southern Lebanon .
The war in Iraq has emboldened North Korea , which built new nuclear weapons and even tested one before the Administration finally went against its own rhetoric , and pursued diplomacy .
The war in Iraq has emboldened the Taliban , which has rebuilt its strength since we took our eye off of Afghanistan .
Above all , the war in Iraq has emboldened al Qaeda , whose recruitment has jumped and whose leadership enjoys a safe - haven in Pakistan – a thousand miles from Iraq .
The central front in the war against terror is not Iraq , and it never was .
What more could America 's enemies ask for than an endless war where they recruit new followers and try out new tactics on a battlefield so far from their base of operations ?
That is why my presidency will shift our focus .
Rather than fight a war that does not need to be fought , we need to start fighting the battles that need to be won on the central front of the war against al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
This is the area where the 9/11 attacks were planned .
This is where Osama bin Laden and his top lieutenants still hide .
This is where extremism poses its greatest threat .
Yet in both Afghanistan and Pakistan , we have pursued flawed strategies that are too distant from the needs of the people , and too timid in pursuit of our common enemies .
It may not dominate the evening news , but in Afghanistan , last year was the most deadly since 2001 .
Suicide attacks are up .
Casualties are up .
Corruption and drug trafficking are rampant .
Neither the government nor the legal economy can meet the needs of the Afghan people .
It is not too late to prevail in Afghanistan .
But we cannot prevail until we reduce our commitment in Iraq , which will allow us to do what I called for last August – providing at least two additional combat brigades to support our efforts in Afghanistan .
This increased commitment in turn can be used to leverage greater assistance – with fewer restrictions – from our NATO allies .
It will also allow us to invest more in training Afghan security forces , including more joint NATO operations with the Afghan Army , and a national police training plan that is effectively coordinated and resourced .
A stepped up military commitment must be backed by a long - term investment in the Afghan people .
We will start with an additional $ 1 billion in non military assistance each year – aid that is focused on reaching ordinary Afghans .
We need to improve daily life by supporting education , basic infrastructure and human services .
We have to counter the opium trade by supporting alternative livelihoods for Afghan farmers .
And we must call on more support from friends and allies , and better coordination under a strong international coordinator .
To succeed in Afghanistan , we also need to fundamentally rethink our Pakistan policy .
For years , we have supported stability over democracy in Pakistan , and gotten neither .
The core leadership of al Qaeda has a safe - haven in Pakistan .
The Taliban are able to strike inside Afghanistan and then return to the mountains of the Pakistani border .
Throughout Pakistan , domestic unrest has been rising .
The full democratic aspirations of the Pakistani people have been too long denied .
A child growing up in Pakistan , more often than not , is taught to see America as a source of hate – not hope .
This is why I stood up last summer and said we cannot base our entire Pakistan policy on President Musharraf .
Pakistan is our ally , but we do our own security and our ally no favors by supporting its President while we are seen to be ignoring the interests of the people .
Our counter - terrorism assistance must be conditioned on Pakistani action to root out the al Qaeda sanctuary .
And any U.S. aid not directly needed for the fight against al Qaeda or to invest in the Pakistani people should be conditioned on the full restoration of Pakistan 's democracy and rule of law .
The choice is not between Musharraf and Islamic extremists .
As the recent legislative elections showed , there is a moderate majority of Pakistanis , and they are the people we need on our side to win the war against al Qaeda .
That is why we should dramatically increase our support for the Pakistani people – for education , economic development , and democratic institutions .
That child in Pakistan must know that we want a better life for him , that America is on his side , and that his interest in opportunity is our interest as well .
That 's the promise that America must stand for .
And for his sake and ours , we cannot tolerate a sanctuary for terrorists who threaten America 's homeland and Pakistan 's stability .
If we have actionable intelligence about high - level al Qaeda targets in Pakistan 's border region , we must act if Pakistan will not or cannot .
Senator Clinton , Senator McCain , and President Bush have all distorted and derided this position , suggesting that I would invade or bomb Pakistan .
This is politics , pure and simple .
My position , in fact , is the same pragmatic policy that all three of them have belatedly – if tacitly – acknowledged is one we should pursue .
Indeed , it was months after I called for this policy that a top al Qaeda leader was taken out in Pakistan by an American aircraft .
And remember that the same three individuals who now criticize me for supporting a targeted strike on the terrorists who carried out the 9/11 attacks , are the same three individuals that supported an invasion of Iraq – a country that had nothing to do with 9/11 .
It is precisely this kind of political point - scoring that has opened up the security gap in this country .
We have a security gap when candidates say they will follow Osama bin Laden to the gates of hell , but refuse to follow him where he actually goes .
What we need in our next Commander in Chief is not a stubborn refusal to acknowledge reality or empty rhetoric about 3 AM phone calls .
What we need is a pragmatic strategy that focuses on fighting our real enemies , rebuilding alliances , and renewing our engagement with the world 's people .
In addition to freeing up resources to take the fight to al Qaeda , ending the war in Iraq will allow us to more effectively confront other threats in the world - threats that cannot be conquered with an occupying army or dispatched with a single decision in the middle of the night .
What lies in the heart of a child in Pakistan matters as much as the airplanes we sell her government .
What 's in the head of a scientist from Russia can be as lethal as a plutonium reactor in Yongbyon .
What 's whispered in refugee camps in Chad can be as dangerous as a dictator 's bluster .
These are the neglected landscapes of the 21st century , where technology and extremism empower individuals just as they give governments the ability to repress them ; where the ancient divides of region and religion wash into the swift currents of globalization .
Without American leadership , these threats will fester .
With strong American leadership , we can shape them into opportunities to protect our common security and advance our common humanity – for it has always been the genius of American leadership to find opportunity embedded in adversity ; to focus on a source of fear , and confront it with hope .
Here are just five ways in which a shift in strategy away from Iraq will help us address the critical challenges of the 21st century .
First , in addressing global terror and violent extremism , we need the kind of comprehensive counter - terrorism strategy I called for last August .
We need to strengthen security partnerships to take out terrorist networks , while investing in education and opportunity .
We need to give our national security agencies the tools they need , while restoring the adherence to rule of law that helps us win the battle for hearts and minds .
This means closing Guantanamo , restoring habeas corpus , and respecting civil liberties .
And we need to support the forces of moderation in the Islamic world , so that alliances of convenience mature into friendships of conviction .
Second , the threat of nuclear proliferation must serve as a call to action .
I have worked across the aisle with Richard Lugar and Chuck Hagel in the Senate to secure dangerous weapons and loose nuclear materials .
And as President , I will secure all loose nuclear materials around the world in my first term , seek deep cuts in global nuclear arsenals , strengthen the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , and once more seek a world without nuclear weapons .
Third , the danger of weak and failed states risks spreading poverty and refugees ; genocide and disease .
Now is the time to meet the goal of cutting extreme poverty in half , in part by doubling our foreign assistance while demanding more from those who receive it .
And now is the time to build the capacity of regional partners in conflict prevention , peacekeeping , and the reconstruction of ravaged societies .
Fourth , the catastrophic consequences of the global climate crisis are matched by the promise of collective action .
Now is the time for America to lead , because if we take action , others will act as well .
Through our own cap and trade system and investments in new sources of energy , we can end our dependence on foreign oil and gas , and free ourselves from the tyranny of oil - rich states from Saudi Arabia to Russia to Venezuela .
We can create millions of new jobs here in America .
And we can secure our planet for our children and grandchildren .
And fifth , America 's sluggish economy risks ceding our economic prominence to a rising China .
Competition has always been a catalyst for American innovation , and now should be no different .
We must invest in the education of our children , renew our leadership in science , and advance trade that is not just free , but fair for our workers .
We must ensure that America is the economic engine in the 21st century just as we were in the 20th .
I have no illusions that any of this will be easy .
But I do know that we can only begin to make these changes when we end the mindset that focuses on Iraq and ignores the rest of the world .
I also know that meeting these new threats will require a President who deploys the power of tough , principled diplomacy .
It is time to present a country like Iran with a clear choice .
If it abandons its nuclear program , support for terror , and threats to Israel , then Iran can rejoin the community of nations – with all the benefits that entails .
If not , Iran will face deeper isolation and steeper sanctions .
When we engage directly , we will be in a stronger position to rally real international support for increased pressure .
We will also engender more goodwill from the Iranian people .
And make no mistake – if and when we ever have to use military force against any country , we must exert the power of American diplomacy first .
Once again , Senator Clinton , Senator McCain , and President Bush have made the same arguments against my position on diplomacy , as if reading from the same political playbook .
They say I 'll be penciling the world 's dictators on to my social calendar .
But just as they are misrepresenting my position , they are mistaken in standing up for a policy of not talking that is not working .
What I 've said is that we cannot seize opportunities to resolve our problems unless we create them .
That is what Kennedy did with Khrushchev ; what Nixon did with Mao ; what Reagan did with Gorbachev .
And that is what I will do as President of the United States .
What I have talked about today is a new strategy , a new set of priorities for pursuing our interests in the 21st century .
And as President , I will provide the tools required to implement this strategy .
When President Truman put the policy of containment in place , he also invested in and organized our government to carry it out –creating the National Security Council and the CIA , and founding NATO .
Now , we must upgrade our tools of power to fit a new strategy .
That starts with enhancing the finest military in the history of the world .
As Commander in Chief , I will begin by giving a military overstretched by Iraq the support it needs .
It is time to reduce the strain on our troops by completing the effort to increase our ground forces by 65,000 soldiers and 27,000 Marines , while ensuring the quality of our troops .
In an age marked by technology , it is the people of our military – our Soldiers , Sailors , Airmen , Marines , and Coast Guardsmen – who bear the responsibility for complex missions .
That is why we need to ensure adequate training and time home between deployments .
That is why we need to expand our Special Forces .
And that is why we must increase investments in capabilities like civil affairs and training foreign militaries .
But we cannot place the burden of a new national security strategy on our military alone .
We must integrate our diplomatic , information , economic and military power .
That is why , as soon as I take office , I will call for a National Strategy and Security Review , to help determine a 21st Century inter-agency structure to integrate the elements of our national power .
In addition , I will invest in our civilian capacity to operate alongside our troops in post - conflict zones and on humanitarian and stabilization missions .
Instead of shuttering consulates in tough corners of the world , it 's time to grow our Foreign Service and to expand USAID .
Instead of giving up on the determination of young people to serve , it 's time to double the size of our Peace Corps .
Instead of letting people learn about America from enemy propaganda , it 's time to recruit , train , and send out into the world an America 's Voice Corps .
And while we strengthen our own capacity , we must strengthen the capability of the international community .
We honor NATO 's sacrifice in Afghanistan , but we must strive to make it a larger and more nimble alliance .
We must work with powers like Russia and China , but we must also speak up for human rights and democracy – and we can start now by speaking out for the human rights and religious freedom of the people of Tibet .
And while we are frustrated by the UN , we must invest in its capability to keep the peace , resolve disputes , monitor disarmament , and support good governance around the world – and that depends on a more engaged United States .
We are at a defining moment in our history .
We can choose the path of unending war and unilateral action , and sap our strength and standing .
We can choose the path of disengagement , and cede our leadership .
Or , we can meet fear and danger head - on with hope and strength ; with common purpose as a united America ; and with common cause with old allies and new partners .
What we 've seen these last few years is what happens when the rigid ideology and dysfunctional politics of Washington is projected abroad .
An ideology that does not fit the shape of the times cannot shape events in foreign countries .
A politics that is based on fear and division does not allow us to call on the world to hope , and keeps us from coming together as one people , as one nation , to write the next great chapter in the American story .
We also know that there is another face of America that we have seen these last five years .
From down the road at Fort Bragg , our soldiers have gone abroad with a greater sense of common purpose than their leaders in Washington .
They have learned the lessons of the 21st century 's wars .
And they have shown a sense of service and selflessness that represents the very best of the American character .
This must be the election when we stand up and say that we will serve them as well as they have served us .
This must be the election when America comes together behind a common purpose on behalf of our security and our values .
That is what we do as Americans .
It 's how we founded a republic based on freedom , and faced down fascism .
It 's how we defended democracy through a Cold War , and shined a light of hope bright enough to be seen in the darkest corners of the world .
When America leads with principle and pragmatism , hope can triumph over fear .
It is time , once again , for America to lead .
The KDE development community has issued the first official KDE 4.1 beta .
This release includes the Kontact PIM suite and significant improvements to KDE 's Plasma desktop layer .
Many of the components in beta 1 are extremely unstable and subject to frequent crashes , but the overall level of polish and functionality in the environment is increasing at an extraordinary pace .
We have been closely watching the evolution of the Plasma interaction layer during the 4.1 development cycle and have seen the addition of many exciting features .
There are some particularly intriguing Plasma improvements in beta 1 that deserve scrutiny .
The Plasma - based KDE panel can now be configured interactively with simple drag operations .
The user can access the configuration system by clicking on a small button on the right - hand edge of the panel .
This will display the panel configuration block and sizer arrows .
The user can resize the panel by dragging the blue and green arrows and can change its position along the screen edge by dragging the silver arrow or clicking the alignment buttons .
To move the panel to another edge , the user simply clicks and drags the configuration block .
This is a big improvement over the previous configuration system which consisted of a simple dialog window .
Although the new system makes it easy to change the panel 's width and position , I could n't figure out how to get it to adjust the panel 's height — a task that was relatively easy with the last prerelease that I tested .
This is a regression that will likely be fixed before the final release .
Another significant Plasma change in this release is the elimination of desktop icons .
In KDE 4.0 , the contents of the user 's desktop folder were displayed as individual launcher plasmoids on the desktop — a confusing paradigm mismatch that we criticized in our review .
That problem is finally resolved in beta 1 , which now includes a folder view plasmoid that displays labeled icons for the contents of a specific folder and will launch them when they are clicked .
The Plasma activities system is also starting to come together .
Each activity is a group of plasmoids with a particular layout .
It 's a bit like virtual desktops , but for plasmoids instead of programs .
Users can add and view activity groups by zooming out with the Plasma corner menu .
Plasmoids can be added to the activity groups while the view is zoomed out .
Zooming out further will make it possible to see more groups at once .
Another very significant addition in beta 1 is the Kontact suite , which has finally been ported to KDE 4 .
Kontact offers a comprehensive set of applications for personal productivity , including support for e-mail , calendaring , contacts , and RSS feeds .
I tested several of its features and encountered no significant problems .
It seems to be progressing very nicely .
There are several other new programs like the Dragon multimedia player and a new printer applet .
KDE 's Dolphin file manager also got a big boost with new stuff like support for tabbed file management and full tree mode support .
These additions round out Dolphin 's feature set very well and make it an exceptionally capable file manager .
KDE 4.1 development is moving at a swift pace and the environment will offer much of the functionality required by average users when it is finally released in late July .
Those who want to try it early should check out the KDE4 Daily initiative , which offers frequently updated builds that can be tested in a Qemu environment .

Mr. Sarkozy has said that he will stand firm in plans to cut 22,900 civil - service jobs this year , including more than 11,000 in education , and 35,000 next year .
The government says it intends to accomplish the reductions by replacing only half of those who retire .
But the unions see a direct threat , and students are worried about fewer teachers and fewer opportunities for good jobs .
With Mr. Sarkozy at historic lows in opinion polls , union leaders clearly feel they have a chance to force him to retreat .
But the same polls also show that the French generally support Mr. Sarkozy ’s reforms , if not the president himself .
As much as 55 percent of the state budget currently goes to pay for civil servants and state pensions .
Mr. Sarkozy and his prime minister , François Fillon , say they intend to have a balanced budget by 2012 .
Mr. Fillon was encouraged on Thursday by reports that economic growth was up in the first quarter , and that the French economy was likely to grow 1.7 percent to 2 percent this year .
Thursday evening , Mr. Sarkozy told journalists that French citizens had “ the right to strike , ” but also “ the right to work . ”
He defended his reforms and said , “ Every time we change something in our country , actions undertaken to better answer the expectations of the French for their schools raise worries , even dissatisfaction , and these worries sometimes , like today , express themselves through strikes . ”
Mr. Sarkozy also said the government would draft legislation to ensure that schoolchildren were watched over by municipal employees in future strikes , so their parents could go to work , although the unions say that the plan undermines the right to strike .
The legislation would require a 48 - hour warning of a coming strike .
for my father
He ’d have missed some of these latest days
our family re-joined
old stories re-told
but told longer this time
as if they grew like rings on trees every year .
I feel compelled to ask you
to raise your hand ( and keep it raised ) if you were related to Chuck
or if you were n’t related but if he ever smiled at you
or if you ever made anyone else feel at home anywhere
or if you ever laughed at anything ever .
And to also ask you to look around a little because , if Dad were here today ,
the people who hands are raised are
the people he would make feel welcome
whose day he ’d prefer to brighten
whose hopes he ’d like to lift
whose laugh he ’d try to earn
and who would likely come to love him sometime during their long , long first conversation .
And in the fashion of teachers everywhereI feel compelled to ask youto raise your hand ( and keep it raised ) if you were related to Chuckor if you were n’t related but if he ever smiled at youor if you ever made anyone else feel at home anywhereor if you ever laughed at anything ever .
And to also ask you to look around a little because , if Dad were here today , the people who hands are raised arethe people he would make feel welcomewhose day he ’d prefer to brightenwhose hopes he ’d like to liftwhose laugh he ’d try to earnand who would likely come to love him sometime during their long , long first conversation .
Ok , i’ve asked too much for my stunt .
please go ahead and lower your hands .
Dad would tell me things in confidence
about so many people
about his brothers and sister , his parents , his wife , his daughter ,
his grandchildren , his colleagues ,
about the many people who touched his life -
He would say such gracious and beautiful things about all of you
and his candidness is all the more remarkable
for its being entirely accurate .
All of you are a part of my parents ’ gift to me
and I ’m grateful to consider you
my friends and family .
And this is where I should hear my dad ’s voice
this is his place , talking to all of you
not mine .
It was his gift , sharing and relating ,
I can only pretend to do it –
nevertheless my father deserves my real voice today
not the one I adopted to get dates or fit in
but the mewling , nerdy , know - it - all one
that ’s actually more about he and I given its provenance from his selflessness .
So I ’ll use * it* hoping maybe I can still conjure his
loving presence
since I can’t hold him .
Especially now
I sometimes feel more like my dad than myself .
I lazily believed I contained only lonely possibility
but listening carefully I hear a gulf mostly filled with his beautiful echoes .
I carry Dad ’s cadence , a sing - song “ welllll now , Mary ”
is my preamble now .
His whistle , used as the transition between dialogues
as if air were filled with fuel for music
which he would combust easily into playful flickerings ,
this whistle I ’ve adopted
less his talent .
You know , hearing him in my own voice got harder as
Dad and I spoke of death more often
nearer to today ’s memorial .
He cried sometimes ,
his agility devolved by medicine or maybe
illness ,
or ministrations ,
or misfortune ,
or loneliness ,
or maybe even joy and would n’t we be so lucky if that were true .
And my last words about death to him ( just hours before he died )
“ I ’d rather not risk my father who can still use words like ‘ elicit ’ ”
laid perpendicularly to his last words about it
“ well , son , if that was the last Blazers game i’ll see , it was a good one ” ( And it was – they came back from an four point deficit with 32 seconds on the clock to a series of teeth - gritting plays that led to a wildly improbable last - second lob – if you did n’t see it you missed an actual thing . )
The game was a barn - burner
for a man familiar with farms
but while we talked this deep , terrible hole was being burned open beneath us .
I thought him fatalistic
and Dad instead gained another opportunity
to teach me about hubris .
He ’s gone
and now i think my heart might be a different shape
it feels odd in my chest
like it gained right angles
I need him here .
I ’m very selfish .
I need him to see the rest .
And he deserved a longer life ; he earned it .
And I know he’d hate this struggle we have
coping with his passing ,
so I ’ve been re-reading this prose I found ,
like a koan .
It ’s a small part of a poem by Wendell Berry
and if I read it maybe it ’ll actually cast some easement here
but you have to imagine you ’ve laid your head
on my Dad ’s chest
and he ’s reading it to you after some bullies in school
stole your bicycle .
“ But do not let your ignorance
Of my spirit ’s whereabouts dismay
You , or overwhelm your thoughts .
Be careful not to say
Anything too final .
Whatever
Is unsure is possible , and life is bigger
Than flesh .
Beyond reach of thought
Let imagination figure
Your hope .
That will be generous
To me and to yourselves . ”
Our taste in poems and other deft art was similar and precise
as wide in variance as a hairline crack in a glacier ,
apt , since we both liked art with a bit of peril
as if to say
this experience might tip you from this - you to the next
changing you to something unrecognizable to yourself
but better , more true to the universe as it is now .
Especially one day ,
Dad , after watching a TV special about a man dying of cancer ,
one of the talking wounded specials ,
suggested that “ well son , it ’s a story that ’s almost enough to make a guy tell the truth for the rest of his life . ”
These seemingly small moments of brave sharing
would nearly burst my heart with sharp joy
and now my lives may always have to measure the reach
of this father - friend
who liked to show me the shape I would become
rather than cutting my edges so I could fit a preferred cast more to his liking
since it seemed what he liked best was to recognize native clay
solid in its mystery
and observe how its wonder was synecdoche for the indescribable majesty of
its being observed by someone .
Hard to believe
he will no longer age
as I continue changing
growing strange to whatever I once was .
But he ’s growing still
as something like light in me and my family
and as I feel tossed lightly and dropped suddenly
living as we all do
like a dinghy in a vast sea
I know there ’s a point
I can steer toward
since his life will be my lighthouse
so that I ’ll always know how to go home .

Advertisement A Russian fighter jet has shot down an unmanned reconnaissance aircraft over the breakaway Georgian region of Abkhazia , Georgian authorities say .
Georgia 's defence ministry has released video showing what appears to be a Russian MiG - 29 shooting down the unarmed Georgian drone on Sunday .
A Russian air force spokesman said the claim was " nonsense " while Abkhaz rebels said they had downed the drone .
Russia 's leader asked why a drone had been present in a " conflict zone " .
Georgia was exercising [ its ] sovereign right to monitor a situation on its own territory
Mikhail Saakashvili
Georgian president President Vladimir Putin expressed his concern in a phone call to Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili , the Kremlin reported .
Mr Saakashvili himself went on Georgian TV to say he had " categorically demanded [ of Mr Putin ] ... that these aggressive attacks on Georgia be stopped immediately " .
Tensions are high between the two neighbours over Russian support for Abkhazia and another breakaway Georgian region , South Ossetia .
Russian and UN peacekeepers have been deployed in the two regions since the early 1990s , when violence erupted as they broke free from Georgian control .
Tbilisi believes Moscow is fuelling the separatist conflict in Abkhazia to maintain Russian influence in the region and to damage Georgia 's hopes of joining Nato , the BBC's Matthew Collin reports from Georgia .
' Absolutely illegal '
The video , shot from the drone moments before impact , shows a jet launching a missile over what appears to be the Black Sea .
" It 's absolutely illegal for a Russian MiG - 29 to be there , " said Col David Nairashvili , the air force commander .
" Russian military aircraft intruded into Georgian airspace above Abkhazia , Georgia , " said President Saakashvili on television .
" This aircraft attacked and destroyed a Georgian UAV [ Unmanned Aerial Vehicle ] .
Once again , Georgia was exercising [ its ] sovereign right to monitor a situation on its own territory . "
Abkhazia 's separatist administration has said its own forces shot down the drone because it was violating Abkhaz airspace and breaching ceasefire agreements .
According to Russian reports from Sukhumi , the Abkhaz capital , the authorities there have put on display fragments of the drone .
Garry Kupalba , deputy defence minister of the unrecognised Republic of Abkhazia , told reporters the drone had been shot down by an " L - 39 aircraft of the Abkhaz Air Force " .
He also identified the drone as an Israeli- made Hermes 450 .
' Destabilising ' President Putin viewed the presence of the drone as a " destabilising factor escalating tension " , the Kremlin said .
" During an examination of the incident with the Georgian unmanned plane , Vladimir Putin expressed his perplexity over the fact that the Georgian side is organising military flights over a conflict zone , " it added .
A Russian air force spokesman said : " What would a Russian jet fighter be doing over Georgian territory ? "
Last week , Georgia accused Russia of trying to annex Abkhazia and South Ossetia by deciding to seek closer ties with them .
Russia has said its proposal is aimed at protecting the rights and legal interests of Russian citizens , who make up the majority of the population in Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
Earlier this month , Nato decided not to grant Georgia 's request to join its Membership Action Plan but promised it would eventually become a member of the alliance .

THIS SCEPTRED ISLE
A staple of American humor about the UK is the population 's bad teeth .
For example , Lisa Simpson was shown " The Big Book of British Teeth " by her orthodontist .
Is there actual evidence that British teeth are worse than anyone else 's ?
David Dreaming Bear , Horsethief Canyon , California USA
British teeth are not bad , but irregular by American standards .
American middle class children are normally tormented with gratuitous cosmetic dentistry to make them look like Stepford wives , so that any dental individuality is regarded as strange .
An American woman I know whose parents resisted this fashion was bullied at school for her " bad " teeth , although she does n't have a filling in her head at the age of 45 .
Christopher Young , Sheffield England
I do n't know the basis for it but it is definitely a stereotype the Americans have about us .
I was talking to an american woman recently , and in the middle of the conversation she broke off to exclaim at what " remarkably white teeth " I had .
Peter , London England Surely this stereotype has arisen out of the American preoccupation of spending large amounts of money on having their teeth done , a pastime which , like cosmetic surgery , the British find too vain to become involved in .
Clive , Sydney Australia
It 's actually Canadian humor .
Mike Myers ( Canadian ) gets the credit for this from " Austin Powers " .
Americans are quiet on the subject of teeth since our first president did n't have any ( except made of ivory and held together by frightful metal springs ) .
Dan Morgan , Boston US
I understand that before the second world war the Americans ' dental health was apalling .
Visiting servicemen spread the use of toothbrushes when they went ' back home ' .
Jonathan , Lancaster UK
It was actually ' The British Book of Smiles ' .
Americans spend loads dewonkifying their teenagers ' teeth so they just look better .
British children 's teeth are much better today than when I was young , despite all those American soft drinks .
Tomas Santos , Hove UK
Its not that ours are bad but that Americans are obsessive about their's .
Its catching on here too with just about all kids getting fitted with braces .
Do n't remember anyone at my school who had a brace .
Notice that Austin Powers has snaggly teeth reflecting the American view of a Brit .
George , Edinburgh Scotland Until the NHS started up , and before the availability of fluoride in toothpaste ( or water ) , our British teeth were spectacularly ugly .
Look at any film footage of average Britons before about 1945 , and weep .
The standard of living of the contemporary American probably afforded them better dental care ; and , I suspect , a certain cultural austerity would have meant that corrective procedures such as braces would be regarded by us Brits as extravagance and vanity .
Simon Gilman , London UK I think Simon Gilman has put it best .
Having spent my first 20 years in America and 14 years since living in the UK , I find that the average Brit is satisfied with teeth that might be crooked , stained , even slightly rotten , if they are n't causing much discomfort to their owner .
Average Americans have much higher standards of expectation in the state of their dental health -- regardless of whether they have to pay for dental treatment or not , they feel very strongly that good teeth are a wise investment in looks and health .
Many visits to the dentist by average Brits happen only after something has gone horribly wrong with their teeth , whilst Americans take an actively preventative approach with semi-annual dental checkups and intervention before any problems become severe .
As a result of the greater amount of attention that Americans pay to their teeth , they are far more likely to notice and comment on the state of other people 's teeth .
Wendy James , London UK Japanese culture has a stigma attached to teeth .
Women cover their mouths while laughing because of this .
Fortunately this also helps to cover up their awful teeth .
An attractive girl will quite often be ruined by a horrifying set of gnashers .
In my opinion free dental care for children on the NHS gives us far better teeth than the Japanese and leaves us with more natural smiles than our American cousins .
John Mullen , Kitakyushu Japan
I do n't know about the States , but here in Mexico the common phrase to describle ' wonky ' teeth is ' dientes ingles ' ( English teeth ) .
Iain Pearson , Mexico City Mexico
I just returned to the US after having lived in England for seven years .
The concept of " bad British teeth " is certainly an unkind stereotype , but I agree with the fact that the English are more comfortable with the idea of having manky teeth as long as they do n't actually hurt .
I think the NHS is to blame , in part for not having enough dentists in certain parts of the country to allow for visits twice a year , and also by establishing the attitude that that having white teeth , free of decay , are hard to achieve rather than a normal healthy state of being .
In the US , health insurance often does not cover dental work , and does not cover braces at all , but since sound teeth are a class indicator here , people would be hard put to just accept having a missing tooth or visible decay for fear of being thought a hillbilly .
Valene Harris , New York US
As an American who has lived the past 3 years in the UK , I am sorry to say that I must agree with the " bad teeth " stereotype .
I know that some Brits ( as I have been reading in the above comments ) see us Americans as being " obsessed " with good teeth , but some of the teeth I see here are absolutely appalling .
Otherwise attractive people are rendered hideous by mis-shapen , stained , rotton teeth .
One time a man I was talking with in a pub claimed he was getting drunk that night so he could go home and pull his bad tooth .
When I asked why he did n't go to a dentist he announced , with pride , that he had never been to a dentist in his life .
I found it absolutely disgusting - just as if he had announced he had never bathed .
I have also seen women in the UK spend thousands of pounds on cosmetic surgeries , including breast augmentation , while completely ignoring a mouthful of crooked , fang - like tobacco stained teeth that badly effect their appearance more than anything else .
Sorry , Britian .
Us " yanks " happen to be right about this one !
Jovanka Steele - Williamson , London UK im a dental hygienist in ny .
the people I see here are just as ignorant about oral hygiene as anywhere else .
many people interested in whitening have periodontal disease , their teeth are actually loose but rather than pay to see a periodontist to save them they would like them bleached because that seven hundered dollars is easier to come up with than the money to actually save the teeth .
alot of people want their teeth pulled and nice white dentures put in instead .
how about some preventitive measures like regular check ups or floss it costs a dollar .
even if you dont have insurance chekups at the most are way way less than the average price of sneakers most people have a low dental IQ no matter what country .
we need to change this .
tooth loss is not necessary even if you 're 80 .
floss !!!
heather , new york usa I have to say , as a tourist here in London for the millionth time , I am always astounded by the bad teeth here which I believe is caused mostly by smoking .
I think it 's cool to have iregular shaped teeth , but staining and rot ... these are syptoms of bad hygeine , not vanity and not genetics .
Apart from being the most disgusting habit in the world , smoking really makes teeth look gross .
When I am attracted to someone , I imagine kissing them .
If I can't get past that initial imagining ( ie. if the person opens their mouth and has terrible teeth ) it 's NEVER going to happen .
Instead of being obsessed with highlights , tans and boob jobs , why not invest a few bob in a trip to the dentist , a bleaching tray and some dental floss ?
The world would be a better place !
Gary , San Francisco USA
As a Briton living in the US for the past four years , I can honestly say that British people do have worse teeth .
I came to US considering myself lucky to have a good set of teeth ; however , over time I realized that my teeth were far from perfect .
And all it would have taken was braces for a year or so .
Americans do have far straighter and whiter teeth than English people .
On a trip back to England I asked my dentist about British teeth , he said even when he offered corrective braces , crowns , bridges for free , people were not interested .
I think British people are starting to care , but have a lot of catching up to do .
P. Doodes , Chicago , USA I hate to admit it , but American teeth are ( generally ) whiter and straighter than us Brits .
However I fall into the typically British camp of , although I would like to have whiter teeth , the thought of cosmetic surgery or self - manipulation seems vain and slightly shallow .
I believe you should be happy with yourself , crooked teeth or not .
Karl Gilbert , London , England I must have misunderstood the stereotype .
I always assumed " British Teeth " to refer to large , even rows of well - spaced , uniform - sized teeth ( easier to floss ) .
I spent years in braces , had a couple of painful oral surgeries , and I still look like Terry - Thomas , so you wo n't hear me complaining .
I actually find my concept of " British Teeth " rather attractive .
Jeff Meade , San Francisco , United States
As a geneticist , I 'm dying to claim that the state of British teeth is at least partly genetic .
Otherwise , I can't explain why the dirt - poor janitor at my research centre , who grew up in Eritrea and had n't seen a toothbrush till he was twenty - seven , has flawless white teeth ; whereas Prince Charles , who presumably had access to every toothy luxury , keeps his lips shut when he smiles .
Premee Mohamed , St. Albert , Canada
I admit that I have heard or seen things that have to do with the English having bad teeth , but I do n't think it 's an " American " thing , especially when 99.9 % of people I know do n't think anything of it and do n't pay any attention .
Besides , even if their teeth are n't 200 % perfect , they have the most fabulous accents EVER !
Renee Chastine , Ann Arbor , USA I think that some of the 60s pop stars are to blame for some of the stereotype .
Peter Noone ?
Keef ?
Bill Moran , Fairmont , WV , USA
If you look at history , poor dention of the English is recorded as far back as when sugar was introduced to the upper classes and coveted to the point of their teeth falling out in the 14th century .
It 's probably mostly Anglo - Saxon genetics .
I do n't understand why people get their panties in a bunch and have to call Americans " vain " and so forth .
Do n't be so touchy .
As an American I 've gotten used to every other nation having some crap thing to say about " my people " , and usually it cuts further than a comment on my teeth .
Peg , Reno , Nevada , USA Being French born living in the US I can testify that : 1 ) the appalling state of British teeth is shared by ALL Europeans .
Their teeth are crooked and YELLOW even in the upper classes .
2 ) The American standards are WAY higher ; most of my employees have flawless WHITE teeth .
3 ) And , yes , I had my teeth redone to match my social environment ( $ 30,000 ) Stephane , Michigan , USA Well , I live in Norway , and most people here have nice teeth , also before braces .
But the times I 've been in UK , I really did notice how everyone 's teeth are more uneven than I 'm used to .
So I do n't think it 's only a US stereotype .
Christine , Oslo , Norway
While I agree somewhat that Americans are peculiarly obsessed with cosmetic dentistry , I do n't think it 's only for aesthetic reasons that Americans pay for things like orthodontia .
Crooked and overcrowded teeth are more likely to fall out , so there are health benefits too .
I 'm sure you guys are right that some Americans get tooth whitening for themselves and braces for their kids just because they 're worried about how they look , but if the fear of developing yellow teeth motivates people to brush and floss more often , then I 'm all for it .
Beth Gabor , New York City , USA I 'm with Peg from Reno Nevada .
Well said , Peg .
But the part about " why people get their panties in a bunch " made me laugh so hard my teeth hurt .
The newest addition to my lexicon .
Jack , New Canaan , USA
A friend 's daughter , a beautiful young blonde ( who wore braces in her teens ) met a charming Solicitor on a visit to London .
As the transatlantic romance progressed ( they are now married ) , the first thing she told her mother about him was that he had terrible teeth !
Bennett , New York , NY , USA
My dad hauled my family and me off to Denver , Col. in the late Seventies , which was nice .
But he suffered badly from ' British tooth syndrome ' , and it was n't simply about a lack of toothy symmetry or luminosity !
I recall that he suffered terrible , agonising problems with his molars at the time , but all of these were solved in a few , admittedly expensive , sessions with a local dentist .
So I submit that it 's not just vanity , but a better standard of dentistry , that was ( is ? ) the main cause of the Anglo - American ' gap ' .
A gap that is I think , these days , thankfully narrowing due in no small part to great improvements in general dental hygiene here ( and improvements in treatment , no doubt , if you can afford them - perhaps it 's just that more people can ) .
Jon Lishman , Llanelli , Wales British people drink 180 million cups of sugary , milky tea every day .
Here in the north we also smoke constantly and drink dark beers .
No wonder our teeth ai n't white .
But at least we 're not all obese .
Patalicious , Darlington , UK I have to agree with Gary and Premee .
1 - I could never be attracted to someone who had skank teeth .
Skank teeth = skank breath and also tells me that the person is unhygienic and probably has bad health .
Not an attractice combination .
2 - I was in the UK when the Queen Mother died , and was appalled at the state of her teeth - ugh !
Black and nasty , what were they doing with all their money ?
Obviously not spending it on a toothbrush and some toothpaste .
In my travels there ( I 've been quite a few times ) , a lot of the people I encountered had nasty teeth .
You may think they 're nice looking til they open their mouths , and it was hard to hide the shock - horror that registered on my face time and again .
I do n't have " Hollywood teeth " , but I do take good care of mine !
Bev. , South Carolina , United States Leave it out Bev , the Queen Mother was well over 100 before she died , so she would have been in age where all the fancy treatments would n't have been around .
Was n't much she could do .
And to all those going on about it being a health issue rather than a cosmetic one , better take a long hard look at you Americans , so obese as a nation it 's sickening .
All those heart attacks , diabetes et al the highest in the world .
Do n't try and preach yo us .
Michael , Nuneaton , England I first really noticed bad English teeth watching British comedies .
It amazed me that actors such as John Inman ( Mr. Humphries ) in " Are You Being Served " and Geoffrey Hughes ( Onslow ) in " Keeping Up Appearances " , did nothing about their awful looking crooked , broken and stained teeth over the years .
I could understand Onslow 's character having bad teeth , but with Mr. Humphries , who was in the public eye , why did the producers think that his teeth look attractive ?
Marcia Smith , New York , US Sounds like a gross generalisation - as daft as saying " all Americans are stupid " , " all Americans are warmongers " , or " all Americans are religious maniacs " ...
Christopher , Brighton , UK
When i was in Britain I didnt see any bad teeth , just some crooked like mine .
But when i was in the USA people had all prefect straight teeth but they had a lot of fillings .
Paul , Bremen , Germany
As an American - born resident of London , I hold the steretype is based on fact .
Brits have terrible teeth !
As a few have pointed out , Americans are obese .
As a whole , we are also more wasteful and harder workers than the Britsih , but those are equally irrelevant to the discussion at hand .
There may be a serious weight problem in the US , it does not , however , negate the essential helath benefits connected with regular dental hygene and dentist appointments .
Despite the absurd claims of Brits being unconcerned with appearances ( the short skirts , bleached hair , and orange spray - on tans up and down Oxford Circus beg to differ ) , Americans are encouraged to care for their teeth for non-cosmetic reasons .
Admittedly as a result , straight white teeth is now the norm and thus , perhaps vainly , expected of the population at large , but looking more attractive is a small " price to pay " to a few more years without dentures .
The obesity argument , besides being entirely off topic , is not a particularly strong one either .
Twenty minutes in the dentist chair twice a year and 2 minute sof brushing a day is an easy way to improve your health and appearance .
While not particularly positive , the amount of work necessary for the average American fatty to get physically fit would be far more intensive .
The question then , for the purposes of THIS discussion , is " Why wo n't the Brits invest 40 minutes per annum and 2 minutes a day to look and feel better and live longer ( not flossing regularly has been linked ot heart disease , gum disease leads to high blood pressure ) ? "
James , Washington , DC USA I can only speak for Belgium and the neighboring countries but I also see the " terrible teeth " syndrome here as well .
There is nothing wrong with having crooked teeth or not having teeth that are perfectly straight .
What there is no excuse for is in fact disgusting hygiene .
I see here in Belgium tons of people with rotting , yellow or brown stained teeth and I do not understand it , considering the availability of inexpensive dental care .
Do not be afraid of a toothbrush and toothpaste .
It will not bite .
dino , los angeles Belgium
You have all made some pretty good points .
Some better than others , but hey we 're all different kinds here .
OK , so the majority of Americans are a little obsessed with dental work .
My dad ( a baby boomer ) was tormented by the fact he had to wear head gear to school in the early sixties .
My grandparents wanted better for their kids then they had .. and when it came time for me to have braces , you bet I had them strapped on my mouth for a couple of years even though I did n't even need them .
Perfection right !
Now , all that money spent on braces went down the drain ...
I did n't wear my retainer .
I still get compliments on my teeth but I do n't really go crazy on making them perfect .
I brush twice a day , sometimes floss , but I do use a whitening mouthwash .. it helps !
So , I 'm going on a date with a fine guy from Newcastle tonight , and although I have n't seen pictures of him smiling teeth and all , I 'll have the worst thoughts of nightmare teeth imaginable , but I 'm more excited to see what kind of person he is !!
Yes , a person with his own identity and flavor !
Sorry , if this was n't really relevant .
We are all not perfect no matter where we come from , we should embrace our differences and just simply get along .
Tina , Los Angeles , United States
I am not sure of this but i believe that it may be because Americans have been putting Fluoride in there water .
In the UK bout 10 per cent of the population , six million people , receive fluoridated water , mainly in the Midlands and north - east , and the government plans to extend this , with Manchester expected to be next .
About 170 million Americans live in areas with fluoridated water .
Gary Bell , Blackpool England
Ok maybe it is due to Americans having fluoridated drinking where it is advailable to 170 million but in England only 10 % of the population get fluoridated drinking water .
I know this American guy he does not brush his teeth for days on end whereas i am constantly brushing mine and my teeth are nasty - well not that bad considering , but they do feel like it .
Gary Bell , Blackpool England America is insecure and will pick out any little thing that promotes themselves !
But as stated above , I 'd rather crooked teeth ( although mine are 100 % perfect - shock horror ) than weigh 400 lbs .
And as " nice " as the American smile is , half of them do n't know where in the world they are .
Let 's compromise - Brits are to spend more on Colgate , Americans to spend more on Weight Watchers and education ( Geography in particular ) .
Matt Green , Brighton , England
The issue for me comes down to bad breath , plain and simple .
I do n't have any problem with unique teeth , but chronic bad breath , well , I think you can safely say that it is the single worst turn off known to man .
I 've lived in Japan , which has to have the worst dental hygeine in the developed world .
Cases of dragon breath abound .
Part of it has to be genetic , because I have lived in Nicaragua , a developing country where most people can't afford a toothbrush , toothpaste , let alone a checkup , and a high percentage of them had decent teeth .
Please do the world a favor and spread sweet smelling kissable breath .
Floss , and go to your dentist at least once a year .
You do n't have to get braces if you do n't want to , ok ?
Deal ?
Seth , Connecticut USA
After reading the article and comments , I have to say that both sides are right , and wrong .
Americans DO have a much higher health standard with our dentistry .
But many of the Brits are right too in which the U.S. has a sickening problem with coronary disease and obesity .
Crooked , plaque infested teeth are disgusting and very unhealthy .
But so is eating at McDonalds everyday and many American schools cutting physical education .
We both have issues to work on .
John , Chicago , IL U.S.A
I would never generalise and say all Brits have bad teeth , any more than I would say all Americans are loud and fat ( although many are ! )
It 's just the way it is , with dental care here .
When I was a child in the 70s and 80s my family had no money , could barely pay the light bill , but my Mom scraped for the dentist .
Not for vanity , but it was equated with doctor visits .
You go to the doctor , you go to the dentist .
It may be vanity now with whitening , etc . but there was none of that then , it was just thought the healthy thing to do .
Lisa , Connecticut , USA I think it's an interesting point that the person made about " if the American dental standard is because of " health concerns " , why is America so record - breakingly unhealthy on so many other fronts ? "
It strikes me that it's to do with spending money , and the American cultural attitude towards that .
It costs lots of money to have the regimented , flawless teeth of an American .
It costs hardly anything to eat healthily and not be fat .
In fact , it costs MORE to be fat .
Therein seems to lie the truth ; in America 's spend - happy , consumer culture , anything which is cheap is avoided and anything on which vast amounts of money can be spent is gravitated towards - irrelevant of health issues .
So dental care is costly and coincidentally it 's good for you .
Eating to the point of weighing literally twice as much is also expensive and coincidentally it 's bad for you .
Buying a huge , inefficient car is expensive and coincidentally it 's bad for everyone .
The average American spends way more on items related to in - active entertainment , such as home cinema systems and video game consoles , than any other person in the world ; conversely they spend far below average on sports equipment and things such as bikes .
The former things are far more expensive ( afterall it costs next to nothing to play a game of football , whereas a HDTV can cost $ 1000s ) and is , coincidentally , unhealthy .
If you think in terms of Americans being " preyed " on by people wanting their money - whether it be food companies or dentists - then it all starts to make sense .
Will Ondore , Milan Italy Wow !
I was lucky to come across this conversation .
I am actually doing a project on British teeth for my High School 's Foreign Language Club 's Mulitcultural Week .
I 'm somewhat fascinated with Great Britain ( I blame it on your actually having a history ) and so I chose to do my project on this .
But I 've had trouble coming up with a reason that everyone thought British teeh were bad , seeing as how when I typed into Google ( or the like ) I came up with many sites on British Dentistry .
I found that odd if everyone supposedly has " skank teeth " ... I thought that if the rumor were true I could blame it on a lack of flouride in your water , but I have since learned that is a false thought .
And , personally , I have a crooked tooth I was born with and when my mother offered braces I told her ( quite affrontedly ) that that tooth added character !
Rachel , Missouri USA
Many of you Brits feel that it is Americans vanity that engage us to worry about the health of our teeth .
It is also consideration for others .
I am not the one that has to look at my teeth all day .
I might see my teeth twice a day during each of my brushings but my co-workers and family are the ones who have to see them all day long .
I can't help but stare at the yellow stained , crocket teeth .
I find myself having to purposely stop staring .
Your right it does bring character to the face .
Just do n't feel uncomfortable when I stare .
Brandy , Hermosa Beach now Otley USA now UK
First off I would definitely have to agree that British people have worst teeth then Americans .
I do n't understand it when British celebs , such as Katie Price ( aka Jordan ) get boob jobs , dye their hair , and tan but do n't bother to fix their awful teeth .
It 's like building a new house with termite wood .
Also , yeah the Queen 's mother was 100 and was living before mass dental health care was available , but I live in the rural South and have met people who are 122 whose teeth were in much better shape than hers .
And secondly , Americans may be obese but you Brits are sure catching up with us being the second most obese country after Americans .
Getting your teeth checked and cleaned is more a matter of health than vanity .
There have been documented cases of people who have died from tooth infections that can spread to the brain .
Just look at the little boy who recently died in Maryland from a tooth infection because he did n't have the health insurance to pay to see a dentist .
Brits have health care provided by their government at least do us all a favor and use it , especially when so many here in American are n't given the option by our government .
Malathia , Atlanta , GA United States
The first I ever heard about bad teeth in England was an article in " Rolling Stone " magazine by P. J. O'Rourke .
I believe it was titled " Among the Euroweenies " .
He relates a story of a very condescending Brit in a bar , who merely grinned at O'Rourke 's responses to his anti-American comments , and I believe the last sentence of the article was " Do n't these people have dentists ? "
I understand that this article is an excerpt from O'Rourke 's book titled " Holiday in Hell " , published in 1988 .
Rita Dalon , USA
Oral health is not based solely on cosmetics , as many Brits tend to suggest .
It has to do with overall personal hygiene and quality of life .
Gum disease , tooth decay and oral cancer affect nearly a third of all adults in the US .
I 'm betting 99 % of adult Brits have suffered " facial pain " in the last 6 months .
N. Saxon , Boston , USA Brandy , your argument is absurd .
I am hardly obsessive about my teeth , but I was lucky to be born with a straight set .
The idea that I should maintain my teeth to avoid disgusting someone else rather than for my own health is just silly .
I 'm almost inclined to use your argument about some of the fatties we have here though .
I should n't have to vacate an entire hallway just to let someone pass ...
Dave , Long Island , NY USA I think it 's a macho thing for the Brits .
I have a few Brit friends and they refuse to see doctors until things get life threatening .
Stiff upper lip syndrome , ..... and I guess it 's the same thing with their teeth .
Freddy , Kaohsiung Taiwan Sorry folks , you can't use the obesity argument anymore .
According to a recent WHO publication , about 74 % of Americans can be classed as overweight , but Britain is close behind with 63 % .
Pot calling the kettle and all that .
As to teeth - I think a middle ground would be nice .
I do n't care if you have snaggly teeth if they 're clean .
Hygiene first !
Maya , Sacramento USA
Simply a different dental culture .
From the time we ( Americans ) were children it was always 2 Dentist trips a year , fluoride in the water , and floss , floss , floss .
White teeth in American culture is much more a symbol of ' hygiene ' than of obsessive vanity .
AJ , London UK
It is undoubably true that Americans have straighter teeth then the british , it is for the same reason that at the turn of the century chinese women had much smaller feet then british women .
As a people we seem to shy away from performing painfull procedures on our children for a percieved cosmetic benifit .
Erik , Derby England Well ...
On television I see a lot of Americans with very white teeth ... but white and even does n't mean healthy , repeated whitening treatments are very bad for teeth - one thing you can say about us Brits - we 're far less likely to end up needing false teeth !
It 's not bad dental hygiene - our teeth are healthy , we do n't have bad breath - we just also do n't have the vanity to spend hundreds of pounds on cosmetic surgery every few months .
Also , I 'd rather be stereotyped for having slightly yellow teeth than being obese , stupid , war - mongering , sheep .
Perhaps Americans should think about the way the rest of the world views them , before going on about how " disgusting " they think we look .
Lucy , Driffield E. Yorks
It 's a cultural thing , obviously .
I learned this early on from my father 's attitude towards dental hygene , and he hails from the U.K .
I was visiting relatives there -- this was about 20 years ago -- and without exception the guys and girls both cared not for dental hygene .
It was weird to see so many truely attractive cousins just neglecting something so basic as your smile .
Mike McNally , Toronto Canada
On a related note , I was wondering ... since there are clearly no dental records anywhere in Great Britain how does Scotland Yard identify murder victims ?
It must be a real bugger .
Wibbett McFreeling , Gasping Ridge , New Jersey , USA
What you have to remember is this - Americans are constantly looking for things to make themselves feel better - who has the better car , who has the nicer home , who wears designer clothing .
I am constantly forced to defend the Southern US ( where I come from ) because the rest of the country thinks we are all a bunch of backwoods hillbillies with no teeth and old tires in our front yard .
Do n't pay any attention to Americans .
So many are ignorant of anyone outside of their 50 mile comfort zone .
P.S. - My teeth are just fine .
Stephanie , Asheville , NC USA Stay away from fluoride !
It 's poison , is possibly a major contributor to the incidence of Alzheimers disease , lowered IQ , and it reads right on the toothpaste tube to call the poison control center if ingested .
Whatever you do , do not swallow much of it !
And remember , U.S. water supplies are full of fluorides ( added ) .
It will be shown in the future that fluoride has been a leading cause of the above ailments and many others that plague us .
Wait and see !
Steven , Great Falls USA
In the Victorian era in Britain , it was fashionable to have bad / rotting teeth as a sign of wealth .
Having black teeth displayed your affluence and ability to afford sugar products and confectionaries .
Some upper - class citizens used to paint their teeth black to emphasise the effect .
I 'm guessing that this - and the American pre-occupation with a Hollywood smile - made up this misconception .
Emily , Middlesbrough United Kingdom
Yes people in the UK DO have bad teeth - but so do other people across the world .
And there are also people in the UK who have NICE teeth , just like everywhere else in the world !
Michelle , Manchester United Kingdom
I thought bad teeth were more of a European thing , rather than just the British .
I am one of those people who has never even been to Britain , but still has that idea of British= bad teeth .
Ignorant , I 'm sure , but there is some merit to it .
The royal family is a good example ( and I am not referring to the elderly Queen either . )
Nonetheless , the British still have the most amazing accents ( although I can not understand much of what they 're saying . )
Heather , Rio Rancho , NM United States
I never associated bad teeth with the British , but more with the Asian community , specially the Chinese .
I know not everyone has bad teeth or good teeth but as a joke the British teeth thing is kinda funny .
M16 , Compton , USA
How about americans shut the hell up for once saying we have bad teeth , look at their teeth huh ?
they are white , straight and oh yeah do n't forget , have loads of fillings , like all their moviestars .
We do n't have as many fillings as them so we have better teeth then them .
They 're just so pathetic too get their teeth bleached , painted , capped whatever you wanna call it , its pathetic .
Yeah i'm British and I do kind of get put off by horrid teeth but all the people i know my age , 17 - have fine looking teeth .
My teeth are a bit crooked and they are n't dazzling white however I use colgate every morning and night , listerine clear mint mouthwash every morning and as a result , im 17 , i have not a single filling and i've been told my teeth are so clean I do n't have to go to the dentist for a year .
Americans have dirty teeth they are just made to look white and straight , if they were n't paying for good dental work they would have dreadful teeth .
Oh and sorry yanks but you 're still fat *****!!
xD Nick , London , UK I was born and grew up in Australia , and I can confirm that this stereotype is by no means limited to the United States .
Also , for what it 's worth , I continually found myself staring at what I can only describe as ' British people 's weird and warped teeth . '
Sure , this does n't apply to everyone in Britain , but I 'd say that most people I 've ever seen in Britain have more warped teeth than back in Australia .
Perhaps the stereotype is on to something ?
Oliver Bisazza , Aberystwyth , United Kingdom
I would like to think humans have evolved beyond the use of stereotypes , but , to address a stereotype , America is nt exactly known for its world wide love of others and knowledge of the world .
And how any American can preach about geography or the metaphysical concept of shame is beyond me .
For those interested I m getting my sources from the Jerry Springer show  just like America gets theirs from Austin powers ISNT THAT FAIR !?!?
( btw , that was satire , look it up ) Daniel Sawyer , Witham UK I was born in the UK and emmigrated to the USA at 34 , where I 've lived for the past 14 years .
I therefore feel pretty qulified to comment .
With few exceptions , the state of American teeth is exceptionally good , regardless of social class .
It has nothing to do with vanity .
It 's just good oral hygeine .
British teeth are better than they used to be , but are still shockingly bad for a country so wealthy .
The staining is attributable to smoking and tea drinking .
Brits drink vast amounts of strong dark tea .
The crooked teeth are due to a lack of interest in getting dental check - ups .
Although I grew up on a British council estate ( that 's the projects to you Americans ) , my mother was a nurse , so she made sure that I got proper dental services .
As an American now , my good teeth are " up to standard " , thanks to my mother .
It 's not a stereotype .
British teeth are not easy on the eye .
Also , the British / American comparisons are not the answer to the issue , as Brits tend to think that Americans are all obsessed with cosmetic surgery .
Make the teeth comparison with countries like Germany , Spain , Italy , etc. Neal Richardson , New York USA
Here in the US we do think that the UK has horrible teeth - not rotten - but apparently getting them straightened has n't occurred to many people .
Add in the horror stories of people yanking their own teeth because they can't see a dentist for some reason ( I 've seen the prices , cost is n't really a factor ) .
" British Teeth " in the US is slang for someone that has teeth that look like a ancient stone fence that has mostly fallen over and been haphazardly repaired once or twice .
Harvey Moul , Seattle USA
I do n't think Americans in general are obsessed with teeth .
It 's just that many of us have a habit of routinely going to the dentist .
My insurance wo n't cover my dental appointments unless I go two times per year .
Any less than twice a year and treatment becomes too expensive - it 's all preventative .
Americans may have a headstart on the use of fluoride because , if I recall correctly , it was discovered in Colorado .
Mine workers has brownish black teeth that were otherwise in far better condition than anyone had ever seen .
It was from the natural fluoride in the water .
( Those who keep bringing up US obesity might want to scan the web for stats comparing obesity rates in the U.S. and in the U.K .
They 're not very different . )
Michelle Wagner , Lansing , Michigan , USA
Ok , well yeah , some Americans are fat but , thats not the issue here .
Yes most people think British people have bad teeth , mostly because they do n't have flouride and do n't frequently go to the dentist .
Also , there is nothing wrong with getting braces retainers or Vaneers ( fake teeth made of porcelain that they put over your original teeth ) .
I had braces for two years got my teeth whitened and i'm getting Vaneers next month .
This is more out of just wanting to look nice than vanity .
There is a diference between being vain and just wanting your teeth to be presentable .
By the way , Steven from Great Falls , you are an idiot conspiracy theorist - flouride is not poisonous , what is poisonous is whatever the hell you 're on .
Katie , Washington , D.C. USA
Well , I was very surpised to see responses from Brits here about Americans being " obsessed " with white teeth to the point of making them appear unnatural .
All I can say is that I would choose " unnatural " and risk being called vain every day of the week before I 'd settle for a nasty mouth .
your smile is what you greet the world with , and nobody ( at least not most normal people ) wants to come face to face with a mouth that looks as though its owner could n't care less about keeping it clean and healthy .
Good oral hygiene , for the VAST majority of Americans , is about not being physically gross and offensive , and NOT about getting teeth that are perfectly straight or white .
My own teeth and those of my children are not really straight , or brilliant white , but at forty - six I 've never had a cavity .
Neither have any of my children , and I 'm proud of that .
We are not well off , by any means , but I make sure everyone brushes and flosses well , and we see dentists regularly for preventive care .
It 's all about good health , people !
Taking good care of your teeth and gums helps prevent MANY other health problems in other body systems , including those related to the heart .
If you 're genetically predisposed to having bad teeth , all the more reason to give your mouth pointed attention !
Mia , Winston - Salem , NC USA
I was unaware of this stereotype until a few minutes ago when I stumbled across this discussion .
Here 's my 2 cents : a . Straightening teeth is an ORTHODONTIC procedure - it 's highly specialized dentistry that is n't absolutely necessary .
b.
Good oral HYGIENE means acceptable breath , strong gums and not having severely discolored teeth .
You should be brushing your teeth , gums and tongue and flossing regularly .
If Brits or anyone in the world has bad oral hygiene , that can be fixed easily .
So I do n't really know what people mean when they say Brits have " bad " teeth .
But good oral hygiene is a must so take care of your mouth no matter how your teeth are arranged in it .
Manju S. , Olympia USA
Brits have the worst teeth .
It has nothing to do with Americans being vain - why are we to be faulted on vanity grounds for good oral hygiene ?
YUCK who would want to kiss , let alone look at a face full of mangy crooked teeth .
Most of the brits i have met have teeth going north south east and west - no thank you !
Melissa , New York NY
It 's quite obvious from the posts made by the British commenters that they believe we Americans come about our good teeth through artificial means .
I find this both surprising and somewhat flattering .
I hate to rob you of your illusions , but that simply is not the case .
Plain and simple : it 's genetics .
The overwhelming majority does n't require ANY cosmetic enhancement , and will never get any .
I see very few people with braces .
I do n't recall braces and retainers being very common when I was growing up .
In grade school we teased kids with ' metal mouths ' and retainers because it was not the norm to see kids with bad teeth .
The average American is born with a good set .
The shape may not be perfect , but the overall condition of our teeth is excellent .
We do n't go to the dentist biannually because we 're vain , but to maintain the health and condition of our teeth .
I do n't know if the British are born with bad teeth , or if their 's deteriorate do to neglect .
That 's only for you to answer .
Nina Hertz , Philadelphia , PA USA I think only Manju is making any sense to me , I live in England always have done , met some Americans in Germany on a boat on the Rhine .
They commented on my teeth and it was the same stereotype , one asked if I 'd had them whitened ?
I said no , it was quite funny really .
I know only two people who had bad teeth , they got them fixed , which is where my argument that this is a stereotype comes from .
Somebody mentioned genetics which is rubbish , you can't use a Liberian who'd never used a toothbrush in 27 years , since the diet of a British male and that of a Liberian male are entirely different , most notably the consumption of sugar .
There is no arguable basis for this stereotype , which is why it is just that ...
A STEREOTYPE !!!
Conor Smith , Manchester England
It 's wrong to blame the NHS entirely for the extent of oral disease and amount of rotten teeth in the UK .
Many areas in the UK have no problem with NHS dentists and the prevalence of tooth decay , gum disease etc is still very high because people do not take pride in , or care of , their mouths .
I think people are starting to care a bit more especially on the cosmetic side , but there are still a massive number of people who neglect their oral hygiene .
Many people never go to the dentist until there is a severe problem which is why it is so unpleasant when they finally go .
However , a bit of crookedness adds character to any smile , as long as it does n't prevent proper cleaning , what 's the problem ?
Nellie Lacka , Newcastle Orthodontics are not just for looks .
Having malaligned teeth can affect your bite and cause improper tooth wear .
Well aligned teeth stay cleaner and healthier longer and help your teeth last your whole life .
Patrick , Ohio , US
Well , I had braces for about 3 years when I was at school .
I do not now have straight teeth , so maybe it 's just that our NHS dentists / orthodontists are not very good ..!
I definitely do n't have any dental hygeine issues though , and no fillings at age 24 ( I do have all my wisdom teeth though ) .
In fact apart from the removal of 4 extraneous teeth and the braces wearing when I was at school , I have had no dental work at all and now do n't go to the dentist .
I would only go if there was some problem with my teeth .
Christian Bale got his British teeth ' fixed ' for American Psycho , stating : " I 'm English .
Our dentistry is not world famous .
But I made sure I got moldings of my old teeth beforehand because I miss them . "
So maybe we just like being ourselves however we happen to have been moulded by genetics and environment .
I have to say though that it seems to be only Americans who have such gleaming dead straight teeth .
I think Americans and Brits compare teeth as we compare other things because we share a common language we assume other cultural things to be more comparable than with other countries ' .
My boyfriend has a tooth missing and slightly crooked teeth , and actually I kinda like it !
Maybe we just have a different idea of what is asthetically pleasing .
Ellie , London England
First off , if many brits ( not all because that would of course be sterotyping ) want to have crooked teeth , who cares ?
I 'm sure I have had more cavaties filled than most of the UK despite my lovely smile .
On a different note I can handle your generalizations that we are fat and obnoxious but I wo n't stand for an assault on geography !
Just because we did n't try to colonize the entire world with our culture does n't mean we do n't know where things are .
And finally as for the war - mongering , excuse you ?
Whose spineless Prime Minister followed the lead of our hapless Commander in Chief ?
Who always follows our lead no matter how bad the idea is ?
I wish your leaders would get some pride and stand up to ours for a change .
Just a thought .
Chris , Minneapolis USA
I do n't think its just Britain , but I can honestly say there are a lot of Brits I notice that should have had a brace and I cannot understand why hey did not .
Children I went to school with ( many years ago ) did wear braces and there was no shortage of NHS dentists like there has been in more recent years .
Interestingly my own teeth suffered at the hands of American dentists who did a survey in Britain years ago providing free toothpaste and dental care for two years .
On going back to my family dentist he said I must have been over prescribed fillings ( having gone from none to six at the start .
Subsequently my troubled teeth and extraction thereafter have been those very teeth with others being fairly sound through good oral hygiene .
The bottom line is that Amercians appear to have much better teeth , although I have noticed that some celebrity smiles are over - perfect making it obvious work has been done which I dislike and think defeats the object ( a bit like many fake boobs being obvious ! ) .
I think a much more natural line should be adopted when correcting teeth .
David Cockling , Isle of Wight , UK
It 's simple , really .
As Americans , we brush , floss , and go to the dentist .
I really do n't think that should be considered vain .
It 's just good hygiene .
Obesity and education ( geography , etc. ) have nothing to do with comparing teeth .
Let 's try to keep it relevant .
Caitlin , Dallas , Texas United States
I 'm 16 currently and have had extensive dental work to the fact that two of my adult teeth never grew so need fake ones put in .
Many of my friends have also had braces etc ...
However I think that much of the stereotypes has occurred because up until the early 90s dentists were paid by the number of fillings they did so it was in their own interest to drill when and where unnecessarily , this meant they would get paid then and would then have repeat custom in the future .
Jack , London Borough of Bexley , England I brush my teeth daily ( twice , if you want to go into details ) , I smoke ( again , between 5 - 15 a day if you want exacts ) , I do not drink tea , I drink water and milk , ocassionally Ribena ( you Yanks dunno what you 're missing there ; ) ) .
My teeth are probably considered " bad " by American standards .
Yes , I have gaps in my teeth , and they are also slightly discoloured .
My problem was n't poor dental hygene , bad genes or whatever other crap you guys are spinning .
The gaps ?
Sadly , I fell as a child , and lost several of my front teeth as a result .
When they grew back , I was too young to get braces ( we 're talking three / four here ) , and when the gaps became a " problem " in my teenage years , we could n't afford braces even if I 'd been conceited enough to get them .
Discoloration ?
Well , I wo n't get too into that , but yes I had an eating disorder , no , that is n't strictly British .
Smoking probably does n't help , but it 's better for my teeth than puking up my meals .
Sorry if our teeth are n't even , whiter - than - white and perfectly straight , but to be honest I 'm more focused on keeping trim , keeping my heart healthy and not starting wars my country can't finish .
Or did America forget their luggage in Iraq the first time and go back to collect them ? ;)
Yes , I am talking about those " WMD's " Leanne , Edinburgh Scotland I grew up in England but now live in Colorado .
Just about EVERYONE
I know in the States has had braces and has had their wisdom teeth pulled out , even when they were not causing a problem .
Part of this is that dentists , like doctors here , make enormous profits from the procedures they do .
I admit that in general , Americans care more about their teeth and certainly floss more , but in fact most young people I know in the States simply do n't go to the dentists anymore because they simply cannot afford it ....
Laura , Yorkshire USA I'm British and found that episode of the Simpsons hilarious .
People need to lighten up and learn to take a joke .
I spent 4 years living in the States and their dental wipes the floor with what we have in the UK .
But by world standards I do n't think our teeth are that bad , though we do seem to suffer a lot of cavities from all those sweets we have . :)
John Pope , UK I have never been to the UK , and I do n't judge anyone on teeth , unless they 're disgusting and black .
My interest in folks from the UK is that I like the accents .
As far as teeth , I have straight , white teeth which were accomplished by frequent visits to dentists in addition to good oral hygeine and good genes .
I have several fillings , most likely due to my affinity for chocolate , but like the true vain American I am , the fillings are white to match the teeth .
I never wore braces , but I had to have my wisdom teeth removed at age 17 , owing to chemotherapy , my teeth were coming in spongy and already decayed .
My point is : I live in the South , and around here , it 's pretty disgusting how people will be 20 years old and have all of their front teeth gone from decay .
I do n't mean crooked .
Crooked does n't bother me .
It 's poor hygiene that gets me .
I 've heard that people from areas where fishing is a popular ( or the only ) way to eat , have beautiful teeth , because of the vitamins and minerals found in the fish .
I need to eat more fish and less chocolate .
As far as the trends , history shows Americans copying other countries and then other countries copying the USA .
Just as long as someone is happy and healthy , I really do n't see the problem .
Teena , USA Will Ondore is sadly mistaken ; it is far more expensive to eat healthily in the US .
You can get lots of fat - laden menu items at McDonald's , Wendy 's or Taco Bell for less than a dollar .
You can't get the ingredients to make a fresh salad for less than a dollar .
People living at the poverty level can usually afford a fast food meal and have their belly feel full ; they can't afford skinless chicken breasts or lean meat and fresh vegetables ( and many poor people do n't have the facilities necessary to prepare and cook healthy meals every day ) .
Good dental hygiene is all about staying healthy , not vanity .
Look up bacterial endocarditis some time .
Jill , Michigan , USA I'm American and I 've lived in London , HK and Osaka .
Yes Brits seem to care less about the state of their teeth than Americans - but compared to Asians the British Teeth are pristine .
That Japanese have some of the nastiest breath on the planet , it was a serious problem with dating when I lived their .
And Hong Kong forget about it !
The problem just gets worse as you travel into mainland China , serious bad breath and body order in general .
While living in HK I mainly dated British women and never had a problem with their teeth or breath .
Now I 'm married and my wife is British , her teeth are sparkling and her cooking sucks .
Jeffrey , New York , NY USA
Hey , we practise sound dental hygiene , so shoot us .
Buster , New York , USA
Well , I have straight white teeth without cosmetic procedures and bleachings .
I am a 19 year old that brushes her teeth twice a day and flosses .
I see my dentist at least twice a year .
Now about USA being obsessed with perfect teeth , this may be true but it has been proven that healthy teeth are connected to a healthy body .
And I just can't see how someone can be alright with rotten teeth .
Food stuck on and between your teeth .
BACTERIA !
Your mouth is an eating device and if your not going to eat off of dirty dishes , then why would you eat with a dirty mouth ?
Sky Nunez , Bridgeport , Connecticut USA
Maybe one reason Americans perceive that the English have bad teeth is because people in such high power or visible to us e.g .
Tony Blair have very distinguishing flaws in their teeth .
Maybe it has to do with the history but rotten teeth are not unique and do not qualify as character , anyone can have rotting teeth if they try long enough .
The statement that wanting aesthetically pleasing teeth is vain , is not true .
Is trying to clear up acne , vain ?
Is dying my hair back to my natural color to cover up the gray vain ?
Is plucking my uni -brow vain ?
I can definitely understand why others think that Americans are vain I just dont think teeth are necessarily the determining factor .
Oh yeah and if Americans are so vain why arent all the fat ones working out ?
Elizabeth , Dallas , US I 'm an American who spent 2 years living in England .
I personally believe that part of the reason that British teeth are ugly is because of the large percentage of smokers .
Though this would n't attribute to snaggled or uneven teeth it certainly discolors teeth to a disgusting brown .
( Another thing is in Mary Poppins the kids have frightening teeth if you ever noticed . )
John Smith , Nowhereland America
I just paid a visit to the UK , and met a very nice fellow with quite a number of missing or black - rooted teeth .
I did n't say anything , because I could n't convince myself it was any of my damn business , but I also could n't help wondering how that could have happened .
He 's not rich , but not poor , either , and I 'm pretty sure English dentistry is less expensive than American , even excluding National Health .
All I can think is : different priorities .
As for comparing the US and the UK , I wonder if a greater fraction of the UK population neglect their teeth than the fraction of the US who voted to re-elect President Ubu. John , Winston - Salem , NC USA
Why do Brits always bring up Hollywood movie stars as if they 're representative of everyday Americans ?
Seriously , if one 's only knowledge about American culture comes from movies and Baywatch episodes , then you 're opinion is not well - informed .
You 're most likely guilty of using stereotypes , just as an American who believes all British have horrid teeth would be .
John , Alabama USA
I 've been to Australia , and to England , and both countries have an overflowing amount of people with horrible teeth .
I 've seen several children in Australia with yellow teeth who ate the same thing that my child of the same age ate , and brushed everyday and the australians teeth were still yellow .
Also , in England , I 've stayed with people who also brush their teeth everyday , twice a day , and even use mouthwash and still their teeth are yellow .
So I think it 's a misconception that the English , and other countries do not brush their teeth and have poor dental habits .
I think the person above who said it had to do with the fluoride in the water was spot on .
If 170 million Americans teeth are bleached from the day of their birth , by drinking flouride infused water , then we 're all just going to have whiter teeth .
haha and as far as the weight comments go about Americans ..
I suggest you Brits come on over to the USA and have some of our food .
It tastes better than yours .
That 's why we 're fatter .
* wink * Helena , Pittsburgh USA
For all those Brits who think they are intellectually superior ; why do you divert the discussion from poor British hygiene , to American obesity ?
Are you so much smarter than us that you are incapable of staying on topic .
You argue like 5 year olds .
Change the topic when you feel hurt or embarrassed .
During my business trips to the U.K. , I met many Brits whose teeth were so filled with the food from previous meals , you could n't tell where one tooth started and the next stopped .
That 's disgusting .
Learn to brush and floss your teeth .
Richard , Palm Beach , FL USA
The power of suggestion is incredibly strong , you know , guys .
If you go to Britain expecting to see the stereotype of bad teeth , you will only notice those with the bad teeth because they fit the stereotype .
It would take a fine pair of gnashers ( e.g. Simon Cowell ) for you to notice that their teeth are actually quite nice , because you expect them to be rotten .
When you see an ugly pair of teeth on a Brit , it registers in your mind and you think " Hah , see , it 's the truth ! " .
In a different situation , I 've travelled to the US before and seen fat people about .
I also saw plenty of thin people , but it was only the fat people I noticed because then I could go " Look , another American fast - food addict .. " .
See what I mean ?
It 's all psychological in my opinion .
I do n't think British people have worse teeth than anywhere else in the world .
Mine are fine and I 've never had any kind of dentist work done on them other than regular checkups every 6 months .
I 've been lucky enough to have naturally straight white teeth that I 've looked after .
Most of my friends have nice teeth too , after wearing braces .
But even if someone I knew had wonky teeth , there is no way I 'd hold that against them .
That 'd be like prejudice against someone 's glasses or freckles or hair colour .
Utterly ridiculous .
Emily , Middlesbrough UK
I have straight teeth , and for those obsessed with saying that all Americans get their teeth whitened , I have never had my teeth whitened - just routine dental care .
I think that is a Hollywood myth that people in Europe think that Americans live like the movie stars .
Also , I was in the Bahamas recently and was sitting by this really obese woman .
Was she American ?
No , she was British .
Check out the fat statistics darlings , you all are closing in on us .
By the way , I do n't eat fast food from McDonald 's , etc , and I 'm not fat .
Stereotypes are so stupid do n't y'all think ?
I 'm sure that bad teeth does n't pertain to ALL of Britain .
Just like not ALL Americans are fat and uneducated .
To even say it makes one look like a dumbbell .
Kaye LeBlanc , New Orleans , USA
No one in my family or me has stained or crooked teeth , its just a stereotype , if someone sees a British person on the street with bad teeth compared to a Brit with good teeth , youre going to notice the one with the bad teeth because its such a famous stereotype for us .
Its like saying all Americans are fat , because of the junk food , but its not true , and personally , I think its quite unnatural to have a set of perfectly sized perfectly white and square in your mouth like a set of polished dominoes .
Megan Foley , Somerset UK
Until reading these responses , I never knew British citizens actually refer to braces as " cosmetic dentistry . "
I think that about answers the question .
Until now , I thought it was peculiar to hear a dental professor from the UK tell a news reporter actually advocating for " annual dental visits . "
I recall once , I waited 7 months for a dental exam and had a guilt trip .
But waiting an entire year ?
Beyond absurd .
On a side note : I have a friend who wanted to become a dentist to help give kids braces in developing nations .
I guess you folks think that 's " cosmetic " though ... that 's weird .
Go see a dentist .
It 's not attractive , and it's not " cosmetic " to see a dentist and get braces .
Before reading these responses , I wanted Obama 's medical coverage .
Now I 'm scared .
Charles Shoemaker , Boston USA
I know this much - I am frequently on websites in which people display pictures of themseleves and there are many Brits and many Americans .
It took very little time before I could determine what country someone was from with about 90 % accuracy just by looking at their teeth .
It 's amazing !
And , I can only conclude the Brits , in general , do not feel it is important to have straight teeth .
It seems sad to Americans because so many otherwise attractive people look awful to us .
Randy , Chicago USA
I think that the whole reason Americans have better teeth is because they have to pay for their dentistry , so therefore they pay as much as possible to get sparkly white teeth .
While in Britain , we have free dentistry , and therefore , our dentists are going to be payed the same amount no matter what they do , so instead of working overtime to get your teeth in tip ' top shape , they do a quick check then run off to their private islands in the Caribbean .
Simple as that .
Callum , Watford Hertfordshire UK People like Richard from palm beach USA ( above ) , notice how uptight this American gets when we mention American obesity , sounds like you 're the one thats is hurt and embarrassed , and when you say something like above , we have every right to mention American obesity .
Now i can finish the argument for you , we do n't all have bad teeth , we do n't all think we are intellectually superior and the comment you left was rude and made you sound very ignorant .
I work in the aerospace industry with several British contractors ( from London and the Isle of Wight ) .
They all have very nice teeth and also love living in America !
Our employer provides dental insurance , which pays for two cleanings per year and other coverage as required .
In addition , braces are also included in our plan .
Perhaps the people with the horrible teeth are relying on a welfare program for their trips to the dentist ??
I say , land a job with good benefits .
If you do n't have marketable skills , learn a trade or get a degree .
In the meantime , do n't let that stop you for taking care of your teeth .
Flossing every day can add three to five years to your life .
Crooked teeth are fine , but rotten teeth can literally kill you .
Cheers and happy hygiene :-) .
Jordan , Seattle USA
I find it odd that so many Americans I 've met comment on my teeth .
They seem amazed that I have white , relatively straight teeth .
My front couple of teeth are fractionally crooked by a degree or two , and my canines are slightly longer than the norm but otherwise they are strong , clean and healthy .
It seems there are two stereotypes here getting mixed up .
There is the idea that brits have large , mishapen , crooked teeth , and then the idea we have actual rotten and unhealthy teeth .
Americans focus more on our royalty and ' upper ' classes than the rest of us .
They are widely known for incestuous inbreeding and this restrictive genepool leads to type 1 ' british teeth ' .
The rest of us who do n't marry our cousins tend to have more uniform gnashers .
Type 2 ' british teeth ' are simply the result of a lack of care .
I brush my teeth and use mouthwash twice a day and visit my dentist ( NHS ) twice a year .
I do n't floss but that 's not too necessary if you brush properly ( there is no matter left after I brush ) .
The problem here is largely education and it tends to be worse amongst the poor usually due to bad diet .
I spend about a third of my year in the US and the rest in the UK and I see these ' type 2 ' teeth in both countries .
It seems the type 1 draws attentions to Britain and type 2 justify it .
I 'd say from experience that bad teeth are universal on both sides of the pond , in equal amounts , but that Americans are more conscious of both their and others dental health than Brits .
Understand , not being overly conscious of my teeth does n't mean I do n't look after them .
It 's just that cleaning my teeth is side by side with brushing my hair and tying my shoelaces - part of my daily routine , no more no less .
Billy , Darlo England I 'm an American living near Leeds in England , and everyone I knew from an early age knew we were supposed to visit the dentist every 6 months to clean plaque .
We were taught that there are health reasons for good dental hygiene .
I did have braces too , but not as much for cosmetic reasons , but to fix some wacky tooth alignment problems that might 've caused headaches as I grew older .
I also makes it easier to chew foods like carrots .
When I go back to the US , I get a bit depressed to see how fat we are , but I also notice that the Brits are " catching up " to the US on fat at an alarming rate .
In Yorkshire , it 's not unusual for me to see healthy , thin , attractive parents with chunky children .
As few people I know here eat fast food ( there 's not that many McDonald 's around , and the Burger Kings are disgusting inside ) , there must be some other lifestyle change going on .
Will , Leeds , UK I keep reading Brits comment about the obesity levels in the US , as if this is some kind of a great comeback for the dental stereotype .
Give me a break , you all are only a few percentage points behind the US in obesity rates , coming in at about 20 % to the US 's 25 % .
Some of you all make it sound like you 're a country filled with fit and healthy people , when the truth is quite the contrary .
Dave , Virginia Beach , USA I was on a first date with a British guy and noticed what I thought were tons of whole black peppercorns stuck on his teeth .
I thought nothing of it at first -- we were at dinner , his teeth were n't straight , so I thought maybe he ate some black peppercorns and they got stuck between his teeth .
On our second date , the peppercorns were still there .
I realized it was rot .
He tried to kiss me and his breath reeked so badly .
I was so turned off I had to turn my face .
I do n't mind so much the crooked or imperfection in his teeth .
But rot and poor hygiene are something else .
Yes , I agree Americans are obese .
But nasty and rotten teeth are just as bad .
Plus they are linked to cardiovascular issues and bacteria from your bleeding gums can actually go into your blood stream and cause other problems too .
Could you imagine kissing someone with rotting teeth and bloody gums ?
He said he had only been to the dentist twice in his life and he was in his mid 30's .
Jenn , California USA
Nothing is wrong with crooked teeth , so I ain't gonna bother with braces ... but yellow or rotting teeth is pretty nasty .
It is not just British people who can have bad teeth .
Yes , even you Yanks can get bad teeth if you do n't brush .
It is just that some people do n't take care of their teeth and it is these people who gave us this stereotype ... so why is it that it is just us that have this stereotype ?
As I have read up the top there , the Japanese have worse teeth and bad teeth are n't uncommon throughout the whole of Europe , so why ?
Rich , Torbay England I just finished the British writer Martin Amis ' memoir , " Experience " - you get approximately two sentences about his falling out with another writer , perhaps five about his first partner , while maybe five hundred sentences are given to Mr. Amis ' rotting teeth and his father Kingsley 's decaying molars .
The entire book is one long crescendo of dental repair .
We , the Americans , rest our case .
Pearly White , Plaquefreeville , USA A few comments : 1 . ) I watched " 4 Weddings and a Funeral " on an HDTV last night .
As far as I 'm concerned , all of the bad teeth in that flick made it scarier than the " Exorcist . "
2 . ) Mike Myers of " Austin Powers " fame is Canadian .
3 . ) Obesity AND rotten teeth are both health issues .
To wit , do we fat Americans know we should be exercising more and eating better ?
Yes , we 're just too lazy to do it .
Do the Brits know about the modern advances in dental hygiene ?
I think so , but as a Yank I wonder if they truly believe in them or care .
4 . ) War is bad for everyone .
5 . ) The comment about Scotland Yard being unable to solve some crimes because they can't check dental records made me laugh aloud .
Tim , Atlanta , USA I 've met British people who had bad teeth , and I 've met British people who were obsessive about their teeth , one woman carried whitening strips in her purse .
But I have to say , of the people in society who choose to let their teeth go , both in America , and England , the British are , by far , the worse of the two .
And , personally , I commend them for it .
Too many Americans are overgroomed , overdressed , and have become whiny little pussies because of it .
Get a Brit and a Yank in a barfight , and I 'm putting my money double - or - nothing on the Brit .
Dave , San Francisco , USA I 'm an American living in the UK .
Despite the fact that I do not have Hollywood bleach - white veneers on my teeth , am not overweight , do not drive a Hummer , and have not spent my entire life living within a 50 - mile radius , I 'm amazed by how many Brits approach me in pubs , at parties , etc and treat me as if I did .
Why do we - Americans , Brits , whomever - focus so much on stereotypes ?
Peter , Bristol , UK
There are stereotypes on both sides of the pond .
Americans think that all Brits have " bad " teeth .
Brits seem to have misunderstood our stereotype and think that we are all just being vain , materialistic , and superficial , supporting their own stereotype .
I do n't know ANY American who thinks that a Brit has " crooked " teeth to the point where they would be unattractive .
When Americans sterotype Brits as having " bad " teeth , what they really are thinking of is " decayed " teeth .
In short , not a lack of orthodontics , a lack of dental hygiene .
Obviously that is n't true of the whole or even a majority of the populace .
I just thought I would comment because many Brits seem to think Americans are bothered by a lack of orthodontics .
That is n't the root ( no pun intended ) of the stereotype at all .
This is a stereotype of dental HEALTH , not dental appearance .
Michael , Omaha , NE , USA
First , teeth in UK are n't too shabby , but they are n't grand either .
Next , based on my travels , the French have the worst teeth anywhere in the EU , hands - down .
As for any POMs being a bit ticked about the program or American stereotyping , hey now , it 's all about who'll watch this rubbish .
As I recall it , " your " BBC carried the show !
Heck , we Yanks are the real victims here guys !
Ha !
Enjoy and remember , you need to floss chaps !
Patrick , Atlanta , Georgia , USA I came across this discussion while looking for answers related to my worsening TMJ problems .
I personally believe both genetics and hygiene / cosmetic concerns play a part in the American / British teeth issue .
I 'm not yet 30 , am of overwhelmingly English ( colonial ) ancestry , and was frequently complimented on my straight , white teeth through my childhood and teens , although I always had a slight overbite and a few odd gaps between teeth .
My childhood dentist said my teeth were straight , so I did n't need braces ( other kids with more obvious problems were getting them left and right , but twenty years ago , as long as teeth were straight , braces were n't considered necessary .
It seems that they are now considered necessary to deal with any irregularity of spacing , etc. ) .
I brushed , flossed , and visited the dentist regularly .
Although my jaw has popped since I was 9 or 10 , I considered myself to have " good teeth " with no real dental issues until sometime in the past 10 years .
In that space of time , it appears to me that ultra- white , perfect teeth have become the norm in America , and a new dentist ( 5 years ago ) told me that I * should * have had braces as a child , to correct the slight gaps along the sides of my front teeth , as well as to help with my apparently hereditary jaw deformity ( small jaw joint ) , which is supposedly a common cause of TMJ problems ( ? ) .
I have had more fillings than I can count , one crown so far , and two TMJ splints .
I do n't have any visible decay showing ( a couple of fillings a year ! ) , but my teeth still have odd gaps and , since I 'm unwilling to pay for expensive bleaching treatments , are less than ultra - white ( though not a color I would have considered unnatural or unhealthy 15 years ago ) .
I 've joked to my husband ( also of English Southern colonial ancestry , who has " great " teeth -- he had braces to fix his more obvious problems as a child , and his TMJ issues do n't cause him much more than headaches - - yet ) that my teeth would probably fit right in in England , because they are generally imperfect .
My dad has similar teeth to mine , is n't yet 60 , and is on his way to dentures , and my mom has decent looking teeth , but lots of fillings , crowns , and TMJ problems since she was a teenager , and the list goes on .
I grew up in a rural area without fluoride , and being a Southerner , have drunk tea ( both with and without milk , with sugar ! ) my whole life , so those two factors may play a part in decay and tooth - color issues .
My long - winded point is , however , that our genes catch up to us eventually .
My " dental genes " , of whatever origin , cause me increasing problems ( and money ) each year .
Being that I am an American , I feel pressure to keep my teeth appearing decently " healthy " , a standard which seems to be raised every year and is becoming increasingly unattainable for those of us with naturally imperfect teeth .
I 'm convinced that if I stopped taking pains to restore my deteriorating teeth , I could move to the UK and fit the English stereotype perfectly !
There 's something to be said for regular brushing , cleaning and flossing , but also merit to resisting an expensive and unattainable standard for perfect teeth .
Meg , Deep South USA
Unfortunately , it 's probably true nowadays that a lot of my fellow Brits have poor dental care .
Thanks to our oh - so - wise government in their money - grubbing wisdom deciding that dentists in the UK could opt to go private , many people especially in the south of England where I 'm from can no longer get a dentist on the NHS .
That , combined with the truly tragic lack of jobs in my area , ensures that 90 % of people can't afford a dentist .
I was without one for 16 years , sadly , and I 've only recently started getting the care I need .
Bill , Exeter UK I love the British .
But one thing which must be " contagious " here is the inability to read .
Most of us Americans have written comments trying to correct the absurd idea that Americans take care of our teeth out of vanity ; but it seems no British were reading .
Look , to take care of ones teeth in the US is JUST AS IMPORTANT as bathing and taking care of ones ARMPITS !
Good God people !!
I 'm met too many people from Europe and Great Britain with such bad teeth -- and I do n't mean crooked !
I mean they obviously do n't brush , or if they do , it 's too late .
Or something .
I no longer care about the " cause " of Brits nasty , nasty teeth .
Whatever .
But as adults , why on earth do n't you do something about those nasty mouths ?
Because you live in a culture which says it 's okay to have a nasty horrible face .
Yes , FACE .
Your mouth is just as much a part of your face as your eyes !
Why do n't some of you Brits know that ?
As for criticizing Americans ?
Oh yeah , there 's plenty to criticize .
If you are from someplace else and getting very defensive ( immature ) .
Look .
The article was about Brits teeth .
That 's the TOPIC .
Not Americans .
Not comparing .
Geesh .
Linda , Austin , USA
What is this argument all about !
You are all like kids fighting !
OK , you Americans are the greatest , you have the best white teeth in the universe , you are genetically superior , you are bigger and better than any nation on this planet !
Are you people happy now ?
You 've won !
Ok , we British are as we are , if you do n't like us or our teeth then do us a favour and stay where you are - far , far away over the Atlantic !
Jillian , Southport , UK I did n't get to read all the comments that was made on this forum , but why does the majority of British population think Americans are fat ?
I personally think it 's unattractive to have a person that is stick - thin with no shape .
Americans have some fat people , do n't get me wrong , but we have better figures ( bottom and top ) and better teeth .
I work in the beauty industry and majority of people I see are most definitely not fat .
They are bigger than the average European I see , but bigger in a good way .
Your teeth are important , as is your weight , but downing Americans for their weight is just a low blow .
Hoai , Tampa , Florida US
I lived in the USA all my life its not that we 're all dental crazy people .
Since health care is n't like the ones in the UK and other places .
We have to care for our teeth since surgery cost tons of money .
It pretty much easier to just keep them healthy then spend the rest of your life paying to get them fixed .

The insurance usually does not cover you since all they care about is therir money .
British people can choose not to care since it does n't cost as much to take care of them , no ?
Giselle , NYC , USA Hello - I 'm English and I 've been to America a few times , I think us English honestly do n't care really .
I mean it 's not natural to have eye burning white teeth , and as long as it does n't cause any pain , whats the issue ?
Are we so obsessed with what we look like , that we ignore what the person is like on the inside ?
Sam Burnham , Burstwick , England Initial Surgical Consultation $ 97.00 - $ 145.00 so going by the latest exchange rates that is to us Brits is £ 60 - £ 70 a visit but then we have the NHS ... K Rutter , Lichfield , UK I have to laugh at most of the comments on here .
None of my family , friends and work colleagues have rotten teeth .
Not all are British though most are European .
I have met a few people with bad teeth , and they have mostly come from a poorly educated background .
I think you 'll find that the vast majority of Brits visit the dentist twice a year , brush twice a day , floss and use mouthwash - the difference is we do n't think straightening teeth for purely cosmetic reasons is that important .
Major tooth mis-alignment would be sorted out , but a few teeth not perfectly at 90 degrees to each other is not important .
Orthodontics in this country is about helping someone with teeth / jaw / mouth problems that cause trouble .
I 've never had a filling in my life , I 've never had to have any corrective surgery in my mouth , my teeth are n't black or crooked - I can't be British can I ?
Danny Monaghan , Sheffield UK
I think that the Americans are right about the British have bad teeth but the English are also right bout what the Americans say about the way that many Americans are unhealthy and obese .
So i think both countries and their people need to sort their priorities as individuals to be able to over come their differences .
Vikum Kodituwakku , Letchworth , UK Apparently few bother to read the previous posts before adding their own thoughts ...
This conversation is going around in circles , no one adding anything new .
To the gentleman in Milan who suggested that America 's preoccupation with the way our teeth look , as well as our health problems , have to do with wanting to spend money , I disagree , but I think you have a point .
I do n't think it 's about money , though , I think it 's about time : we work too much , do n't get enough sleep , grab dinner at McDonald 's on the way home ( which may not be cheaper than a healthy , home - cooked meal , but is very cheap indeed when it comes to prepared food ) , then get home and plop on the couch in front of our big screens because we 're too tired to do anything else .
Sarah Shafer , Fort Collins , USA Surely ' confirmation bias ' has to be partly responsible for this ?
If Americans hear about the sterotype of British people having bad teeth , then when they come over hear for first time and notice the occasional person with bad teeth , it confirms to them that all Brits have bad teeth .
They probably wo n't notice that most people have perfectly reasonable and healthy teeth .
Sterotypes always start from somewhere though , but being British and living here for most of my life , I do n't know many people with bad teeth , so I expect that it is something that was more usual a few generations ago and the stereotype has stuck .
And aside from teeth that are rotten and severely stained , surely the odd ' odd ' tooth adds a bit of character !?
Absolute perfection is rarely that beautiful .
Remember the gap toothed Wife of Bath from Chaucer 's tales ?
Her gap tooth was a sign of her sexuality and lustfulness !
Sarah Law , London UK
The Americans look as if they have false teeth .
Teeth by nature grown unevenly and are not a perfect shape .
Then again , you need good teeth if you eat vast amounts of steak ... Mike Ellison , Warrington , England Unless someone has horrifically misshapen nashers I honestly do n't notice .
I do n't think I 've ever seen someone who at first seemed attractive but was immediately proven to be repulsive as soon as they smiled .
Perhaps this proves that English teeth are so bad that I 've been totally desensitised to the fact that I 'm surrounded by walking eye - sores .
Perhaps , on the other hand , it proves that us Brits go for the natural look ?
David Carter , London U.K .
I believe that the last comment about steak is quite possibly the most hilarious and absurd answer ive read on this board so far .
Austin Terry , Dallas , Texas , USA Contrary to some of the posters in denial here , white teeth are natural .
White is the only color they come in originally .
They only get discolored if they are stained by consumption of things that stain teeth , then not brushing them properly .
The other reason teeth turn any other color but white is disgusting rot , also obviously caused by very poor oral hygiene .
It 's a HYGIENE issue in the US , not a cosmetic issue .
And braces are n't seen as cosmetic here , either .
Straight teeth work better , are easier to take care of , and prevent problems with jaw alignment .
The reason many Americans have lots of fillings is because we go to the dentist regularly and get our teeth repaired when a cavity appears .
Lack of oral hygiene causes periodontal disease , missing teeth can cause bone loss , plaque allowed to fester in the mouth has been shown to make it's way into your blood stream , clogging arteries and other important stuff .
Good oral hygiene has been shown to translate into a generally healthier body .
Get braces for yourself or child if they need them , floss and brush at least twice a day , and see a dentist at least twice a year and your British teeth will look just like our " unnatural " straight , white , American teeth .
And guess what ?
We Americans can't get an " NHS " dentist either .
We pay for our own dental care .
It 's considered akin to bathing or keeping a wound clean here .
Common sense hygiene .
Frank Annsirs , Seattle , USA
You 're all correct about Americans being obese .
In the last 20 years we 've become hogs .
What a sorry , sorry way to be .
I was born with straight teeth .
Mary , Vincennes , IN , USA
It is an odd thing , but I know several Brits and their teeth are vary large , crooked and discolored .
Im not saying they are worse ( beauty in the eye of the beholder ) - but they are all consistently : large , crooked and discolored .
I think the words : worse than is a matter of opinion but they are : large , crooked and discolored .
It 's up to individual taste as to if they are better or worse .
Sharon Andrews , Chicago , USA America has had fluoride in its water ever since the 70s and I think that plays a huge role .
All of these comments I see posted by people in the UK saying we pay lots of money for our ' unnatural ' looking teeth are false .
I was born with straight teeth and my teeth are white because American kids are raised with parents , teachers , kid shows etc telling us to brush after every meal .
And pretty much every American kid with noticeably crooked teeth gets braces to straighten them out because they are easier to take care of when they are straight .
On top of all that most Americans go to the dentist for check ups twice a year .
Having bad dental hygiene is bad for your health .
We do n't try to have good looking teeth , we do it because we were brought up with great dental hygiene .
Andrew , Orlando , Florida , USA
Reading this thread has been all too funny and actually , extremely entertaining !
I believe I will save it for future reference .
Yes , I admit that I was led to this " discussion " by Googling " Austin Powers " and " bad teeth " .
Okay , blame Mike Myers , though he is Canadian .
You know , actually , many of us have a parent or sibling from each country .
This whole thread acutely illustrates the stereotypes , ignorance and fears on both sides ; the attempts to defend ' God ' and ' Country ' ... and it's all over TEETH !
Now , imagine a real world issue and the confusion that causes on our planet .
Maybe , now , we can understand why it is so hard to get together and solve some of the most serious problems affecting this planet .
It seems to become so difficult when someone is always drawing a line in the sand and forcing the inevitable taking of sides ; instead of us all trying to have some empathy and relate to each other as fellow citizens of this planet .
Im from Houston in the US but I love the United Kingdom and its wonderful , kind people - the land of my forefathers .
Love and peace , people ... and great , healthy teeth to everyone !
Ken , Houston , USA Funny that the Americans are knocking the Brits for bad teeth , and the Brits are knocking Americans for being fat .
The truth is we ( Americans ) are fat due to our sugar intake , and you Brits have bad teeth for the same reason .
We do concentrate more on oral health , and possibly you concentrate more on physical health .
Although , you 're not far behind on the obese scale .
Please , people , do n't say it 's the flouride .
Flouride is completely toxic and IS NOT the reason for good teeth .
Kimberlie , Michigan , USA I have been living in London for about 6 months now , and I am surprised to find that ( generally ) most people my age ( 23 ) have nice teeth .
I have noticed that the older generations tend to have some pretty awful teeth ( sorry ) .
My flatmate 's father is actually missing a tooth , and he 's OK with it .
I have noticed this in several older adults .
I am quite paranoid about teeth , so if mine look a little yellow , I 'll immediately make a dentist appointment .
Having lived in the UK for a few months , I have DEFINITELY noticed that my teeth have gotten more yellow , although I have kept my same dental hygiene habits .
I do n't understand how you can overlook dental hygiene .
It 's a part of your health .
Tooth decay and gum disease can lead to heart disease .
How this does n't make sense to people , I just do n't get .
The older generations just do n't care .
And hey , to each his own .
But , your teeth are visible basically all the time - when you eat , talk , smile , etc .
Why would n't you want them to look nice ?
And I 'm not talking PEARLY white , but why put up with yellow teeth ?
And missing teeth ?
So what about crooked teeth , but good Lord , missing teeth ?
We 're not teething any more .
Valentina , Atlanta , USA I think we British do n't have as bad teeth as it was in the past .
Younger generations such as people my age ( 17 ) have pretty perfect teeth , usually a " Hollywood smile " .
However , looking at older generations , my mother and father do n't have fantastic teeth .
I think it 's probably to do with the fact we all care about how we look now , but the bad teeth stereotype about Britain is starting to fade nowadays .
Jamie Perry , Doncaster , UK I am sorry but it 's true .
Brit teeth are horrible .
I have seen far better teeth in Africa and the Mid East than I have here .
It must be genetic .
Brit teeth = gross .
Virgil Donarski , Bradford , UK
Of course Brits have the worst teeth in the world .
Well below average .
I have been living in the UK for 10 years and only know one English girl who has nice teeth and is proud of her smile .
It 's unbelievable .
What 's wrong with you people ?
Save money that you spend on crisps and get your teeth fixed !!!
Jay Geneviciute , London , UK
Well , I do n't think the braces explanation is sufficient when comparing British people to Americans .
There appears to be a disproportionate number of British people ( at least among those of Anglo - saxon / Anglo - celtic backgrounds ) who have incredibly poor jaw and mouth structures .
Braces do little to fix this .
Andrew , Sydney , Australia
I live in the USA and my teeth are definetly not the greatest , but they are white , and I brush them twice a day .
But it 's true that in America if you do n't have nice teeth you get frowned upon .
And being that my teeth are not straight that seems to be the first thing that people notice about you , they figure if you do n't look picture perfect then your not worth their time .
Tamra Lutes , Beattyville , KY , USA
We British have wonky teeth but they are just as bad in other places in the world , like Belgium for instance .
Besides , Americans have straight teeth with fillings - a stereotype .
You can not say British have bad teeth , its a stereotype as well .
Robert Nikhwai , Chatham , Kent , UK
My wife recently shipped over one of the top UK consultants in sales over to the USA to help her staff , whilst the training was excellent the majority of the course feedback slips were concerned with the consultants bad ( wonky ) teeth .
When my wife latter gave the feedback the consultant laughed , and mentioned she would rather have bad teeth and have a job than be fat and broke .
2
Months later my wife closed down the department due to poor figures and outsourced it to Canada .
I am American , and I know that we are concerned with showing our wealth even when it serves no purpose or if it is damaging to the environment ( watering our lawns even though our water supply with be gone in the next 20 years , wearing retainers in our late 30's even though we have a stronger chance of heart attack / stroke than any other country , taking the large gas guzzling SUV 1 mile down the road to go shopping ! ) .
I think the UK has the right idea , and like my wife says ' a pig with lipstick on , is still a pig ' .
Bob Nortway , Chicago , USA
See this link , there are a lot of Americans here with ' bad ' teeth .
Seems a shame that people with good teeth are referred to as having bad teeth because whilst clean and healthy they 're not unnaturally straightened .
http://nowthatsnifty.blogspot.com/2009/10/celebrities-with-bad-teeth.html
James Page , Newcastle , Northumberland , UK I have lived in the US for 37 years having grown up in the UK in the '50s with NHS dentistry .
My teeth are still crooked and discolored even though I have always had regular preventative care here .
I wish I had had better care in the UK as a child .
I made sure my kids all had orthodontic care if they needed it .
It was never offered to me .
By the way , it 's obvious from the posts that the Brits spell more accurately than the Americans !!
Pat Duran , Littleton , USA
I think that there is definitely some truth in the stereotyping of " british teeth " .
Some of this stems from bad oral hygiene , poor discipline and the so - called ' stiff upper lip ' .
However , I think more is attributable to the cost of dental care here .
True , we have the NHS .
However , this is inaccessible to many , and for those who do have access offers only basic treatment when things go wrong .
I personally have two cavities in need of repair , I am unable to find an NHS dentist willing to take me on and therefore am forced to go privately .
After a 10 minute ' consultation ' - for which I was charged £ 100 I was informed that the cost of dental work was approx £ 2,500 .
The average salary in the UK is circa £ 25,000 .
That 's nearly 10 % of an average annual wage .
There is no way that I could afford this at the moment , therefore I will have to save for the work , by which time things may have deteriorated and the cost increased .
It 's a vicious circle .
I can't compare this cost with that of dental work in the US , but I struggle to believe that it would be a similar percentage compared to earnings .
Terry Smith , Newmarket , UK I have lived in the US for over 30 years now , and I have to say that many Americans have teeth that are worse than any I ever encountered in England .
I grew up in north west England , and my parents took my sister and me to the dentist on a regular basis , as did the parents of most other children of our age .
We were by no means wealthy and went to NHS dentists .
I had never seen teeth as rotten as some I saw in the US when I emigrated here .
Not just the " Bubba Teeth " that were the stereotype of the American South where I live , some of the worst were in the mouths of people from the north ( New York , Chicago , Detroit ) .
Reg Davies , Charlotte , USA
Many of the comments by the yanks here are infuriating .
I have been to the US a few times now and I 've seen some pretty awful teeth there .
In fact I 'd say the worst set of gnashers I 've ever seen were in the US - Atlanta , Georgia , to be precise .
Although I do admit that the upper classes ( such as our simpleton Royals ) seem to have inexplicably wonky teeth - maybe down to centuries of inbreeding perhaps ?
In the UK we have good dental hygiene , but we do n't overly worry about having the straightest teeth .
When I was 13 I went to the orthodontist and had a brace fitted on my top teeth .
After a year ( I think ) the braces were removed and the OD suggested I could have tracks fitted to my lower teeth as they were starting to crowd a bit .
I WAS 13 !
Of course I was n't going to opt to have another year of mouth - metal !
And my parents certainly did n't try to push me into it either .
It was my choice and that 's that .
I wish I 'd chosen different now but I made plenty of other terrible decisions at 13 .
So I now have one tooth which sits further back in my mouth than its neighbours and you yanks think that means I 'm disgusting ?
And that I have bad breath / gum disease / poor hygiene ?
I have 2 fillings and I'm 40 .
How many of you can claim the same ?
And do n't give that crap that most Americans do n't have corrective treatment .
My sister in law is American and her whole family have had ' retainers ' .
Apart from her dad , who has wonky teeth .
To Chris in Minneapolis who said " Just because we did n't try to colonize the entire world with our culture ... "
You are kidding right ?
Why do you think we all despise the yanks ?
And the British did n't try to colonise the world with our culture - we colonised it with big guns and excellent seamanship .
However that was hundreds of years ago and we either lost or gave back the places we colonised / stole or invaded .
We have a vast history compared to yours - we 've been invaded and colonised ourselves too you know - and we 've matured .
The USA will too , we all hope , one day .
The simple fact is this :
Most of the rest of the world have worse LOOKING teeth than the Yanks and Aussies .
However the Yanks just have this really weird inferiority complex about the Brits which makes us the target of most of their racial jokes .
And finally , to those idiots who keep suggesting its genetics , this is proof positive that the yanks think they are a different , superior , species ( cue all the comments from some immature Yanks claiming exactly that ) .
Genetics ?
WTF ?
Those few who suggested that here are total morons .
Can you please explain to me how ' superior ' genetics could cause teeth to straighten and become miraculously white in less than a century ?
What , you evolve fast over there do you ?
And really finally , I actually love most of the Yanks I 've met , and the country , but collectively you really are a pain in the ass ( which is a donkey / pony hybrid , incidentally ) .
And , just like us Brits , your government and your foreign policy really lets you down .
Matt Hill , Richmond , Surrey , UK I think that Americans have set this standard of teeth being nice whether the face is nice or not .
I 've heard from many Americans say things about European people .
Maybe European people and British people have more things to care about other than looks ...
Trust me , Americans have bad teeth but they get to fix them , maybe some Britons do n't want to fix their teeth .
Alex , Limassol , Cyprus To all the insult - slinging British and Americans :
Try to behave like adults !
Resorting to stereotype - based insults is just pathetic of you .
Not all British people have bad teeth ( though some do ) , not all Americans are fat , stupid and vain ( though some are ) .
There are bad teeth in the USA , just as there are fat , stupid , vain people in the UK .
The responses above certainly prove one thing both nations have in common : the ability to be idiotically childish over something of little importance .
Jen , Oregon , US I'm Scottish and very proud of that but I must admit that we Scots have the worst teeth in the developed world .
It stems from bad diet and poor dental education .
My fiancée who is black African comes from a very impoverished background but has the most perfect white teeth I 've ever seen !.
She hates my many missing teeth and it causes many an argument !
Moral to the story : look after your teeth wherever you come from .

We recently hosted a Korean girl as an exchange student .
Her front teeth were so big and stuck out so far that she could barely close her lips over her teeth .
We live in a community where most every teen has braces .
While she lived with us , my two children and myself were all in braces .
Interestingly enough , guess what she did as soon as she returned to Korea ?
She was in braces within the month !
I think she will be so much more attractive , have an easier time of eating politely , and have great career advantages with nice straight teeth .
Sarah , Dallas , US @Sarah .
Yes because , heaven forbid , she should look like she has n't had corrective surgery !

To be completely honest , I had n't even heard of this " Brits with bad teeth " stereotype until I stumbled upon this conversation .
As a matter of fact , I NEVER hear ANYONE " making fun " of the British .
If anything , people around here admire the British .
I have no clue where this idea came from that Americans walk around thinking that we are better than everyone else ; in my experience it 's just not true .
Now , let 's stop slinging stereotypes , aight ?
I mean come on , people , it upsets me to see so many hurtful words on here , from both parties .
Obviously both the US and UK and EVERY country on this planet have some sort of thing that they need to work on .
So what ?
I really feel that in a " modern " and " enlightened " age we can finally learn to stop being asses to each other .

I do n't know about British teeth , but one thing I know since I spent years in the US ( Minneapolis and NY ) , is that American teeth ar far from being perfect !
In fact , the Americans all having good teeth ( or at least " aesthetically correct " in their view ) is as much a cliché as the British having bad ones !
I 've encountered lots of people who had " bad teeth " , and some who had " nice " ones too of course ( well , their opinion of what are " nice " teeth is really subjective , I think it looks more extraterestrial than anything else , but that is not the question ) .
But what is the most annoying is the American obsession about those kind of things !
It really tells a lot about their culture and society , where appearance is so important .
As if you could judge the value of someone by looking at her or his smile ...
Someone said on this forum that while talking to this American woman , she stopped him only to tell him how incredibly white his teeth were .
That sums this up quite well !
And a similar story happened to me one day too , I was grocery shopping with a friend of mine in Minneapolis and this girl came to me to tell me I had great teeth !
I really did not know how to react or what to say , but one thing I knew was that I was not flattered at all !
How could I knowing that if I had had bad teeth , she would have probably thought the opposite way , thinking I was a cheap redneck or whatever !
To all Americans : if you think someone has good teeth , or is beautiful , or anything else , please just do n't say it in public , especially when you do n't know the person you telling it .
It 's just rude !
Restrain yourself !
We know you 're the talkative type but still ! ;)

Though the latest NIE on Iraq was delivered to Congress on April Fools '
Day , you 'll probably never get to see any part of it .
The Bush administration decided that the public has no need to know what intelligence agencies think about the state of a country the US invaded and occupied five years ago .
That 's hardly unexpected .
A few weeks back when the Pentagon delivered it 's latest quarterly happy talk , " Measuring stability and security in Iraq " ( PDF ) , it did so with minimum fanfare .
Quarterly reports have to be published by law , NIEs do not .
And just to make sure that everybody understands that there 's no real need to publish this Iraqi NIE , the administration let it be known that it is n't really an NIE at all .
According to an administration official with knowledge of the intelligence process , this morning 's intelligence document is n't itself a National Intelligence Estimate .
" It 's not a formal report , " the official said , " it 's more or less an assessment memo , an update to policy makers . "
It 's no surprise that the White House thinks public debate is best served by a misinformed citizenry .
What 's a little more remarkable , though , is that the WH has now sent out officials to describe the Iraqi NIE 's contents to reporters - an NIE it insists on keeping secret .
The NYT provides us with an official version of those contents .
Treat it all with due skepticism .
A new National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq cites significant security improvements and progress toward healing sectarian political rifts , but concludes that security remains fragile and terrorist groups remain capable of initiating large attacks , several American government officials said this week .
The classified document provides a more upbeat analysis of conditions in Iraq than the last major assessment by United States spy agencies , last summer .
It was completed this week , just days before the top American commander in Iraq , Gen. David H. Petraeus , is due in Washington to give lawmakers a progress report on the military strategy in Iraq .
While the last assessment painted a grim picture of an Iraqi government paralyzed by sectarian strife , the new intelligence estimate cites slow but steady progress by Iraqi politicians on forging alliances between Shiites and Sunnis in Iraq , said the government officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the document is classified .
Actually , the previous NIE from August 2007 was remarkably upbeat as well , citing slow but steady progress :
" There have been measurable but uneven improvements in Iraq 's security situation since our last NIE on Iraq in January 2007 . "
If the anonymous government officials ' assessment of the latest NIE is accurate , and that 's a big if , then like the last estimate it accentuates the positive .
In any case , it probably reveals little about Iraq that the public does n't already know from news reports ( again , much like the August 2007 NIE ) .
Several lawmakers familiar with its conclusions declined to provide specifics but said it contained little information beyond public accounts of recent events in Iraq .
" The stuff that was positive , they emphasized .
The negative , they stated , but deemphasized , " said Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. ( D - Del. ) ... " I was discouraged " by the assessment , Biden said .
" I was discouraged by the last one , too . "
This is what the WH wants the public to believe about an NIE it can't read :
" The N.I.E. update confirmed that the surge strategy the president announced in January of last year is working , " said one senior administration official .
" There ’s more work to be done , but progress has obviously been made . "
That ever elusive " progress in Iraq " the WH has been talking about since June 2003 .
We know it was making stuff up about progress in 2003 , again in 2004 , also in 2005 , and in 2006 , as well as in 2007 .
But how credible is the Bush administration in 2008 ?
By a remarkable coincidence , just yesterday the NYT published an account of Nouri al - Maliki's " planning " for last week 's disastrous assault on Basra , an account based on named and unnamed American officials .
The point of the exercise was to convey the idea that the Bush administration had virtually no idea what Maliki was going to do until two days in advance - and then only because Maliki invited General David Petraeus to a parlay on March 22 and told him his plans .
In short , by the administration 's own account it can't be held accountable for last week 's failure because it was caught almost completely unawares regarding the biggest Iraqi military operation since 2003 .
One way or another , the Bush administration 's record of perspicacity in regards to Iraq is abysmal .
That 's approximately how much we can trust the latest , secret NIE on Iraq .
DIGG THIS
I ’m the wrinkle , and I was ejected from a deliberating federal jury on March 13 .
The case was United States v. Robert Luisi , and I was thrown out because I refused to take a second oath of jury service that would have required that I suspend my common sense , and even suspend my belief in an objective reality .
This second oath would literally have bound me to find the defendant guilty if the judge had instructed me that " the law says all Italians are guilty . "
( Luisi is of Italian heritage . )
All jurors in federal courts , according to the jury handbook I was given , take " an oath to decide the case u2018 upon the law and the evidence . ’"
The handbook then describes : " The law is what he judge declares the law to be . "
I found out later that — even if the judges do n’t take the Constitution literally — they take this last part literally .
The actual oath I took as a juror was to decide the case " according to the facts and the law as the judge presents . "
It was essentially the same as the juror handbook , just a little closer to the actual verbiage used in Article III of the U.S. Constitution .
U.S. District Court Judge William G. Young , a Reagan appointee , presided and immediately after our oaths launched into a 45 - minute description of the U.S. Constitution .
He made a point of saying : " You are all constitutional officers . "
But he did n’t just describe the jury mentions in the U.S. Constitution , he summed the whole document up — and ably so .
More than one juror ( not me ! ) groaned on the way back to the jury room for a break that the speech had been too long .
Then we heard all the evidence , four weeks of it .
Everybody had a nickname : Bobby the Cook , " Skinny " Joe Merlino , even " Harry the Hunchback . "
( I ’m not kidding . )
The defendant , Bobby Luisi , was a Boston capo in the Mafia who had sold a total of three kilos of cocaine to an FBI agent in 1999 .
Luisi was charged with two counts of possession of cocaine with an intent to distribute and one count of conspiracy to possess cocaine with an intent to distribute .
The transactions took place within Boston city limits , and the prosecution made no attempts to produce any evidence that anything had ever crossed a state line .
The case itself was really academic , related more to career control than to crime control , as Luisi had already confessed to a murder and racketeering charge .
He was n’t going from the courtroom back to his home in Medford , Mass .
He was going back to the pokey each night .
For the ambitious Boston - based U.S. attorney , Michael " Maximum Mike " Sullivan , it was an opportunity to have his underlings run up the score for his résumé .
The fact that Luisi was getting another trial meant that Luisi got a field trip outside of his prison cell several times per week .
This was Luisi ’s second trial on this cocaine charge .
The first trial held in 2002 was overturned on appeal when a higher court ruled that jurors could consider that he had been entrapped .
( FBI informant and mob associate Ron Previte had gotten the boss , Philadelphia ’s " Skinny " Joe Merlino , to call Luisi to push the deal through . )
All Luisi could do was smirk throughout the month - long trial , almost certainly thinking about how many field trips he got to have to the courtroom because a district attorney wanted another scalp on the mantle .
Fast forward to the day of deliberation .
The court just happened to have a visiting judge in from South Korea all day — who Judge Young described as " an expert in case management . "
The judge gave us instructions on the law related to entrapment before we were to begin deliberations .
He told us explicitly : " You do n’t have to check your common sense at the door " of the jury room and said that we could make " rational inferences " and draw " logical conclusions . "
I went into the jury room and told them what I thought , explaining the concept of delegated powers and the limits of the language in the commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution , and then all hell broke loose .
The other jurors were good people but were n’t familiar with the details of the Constitution and under the sway of the philosophy of : " The law is what he judge declares the law to be . "
Eventually , the foreman convinced me to write a question to the judge .
I told him I ’d write one , but also said that he ’d give us a " because I said so " reply .
Here ’s what I came up with : " If 2/3 of the Congress decided in 1918 that they needed to amend the constitution in order to ban mere possession of a substance ( in that case , prohibition of alcohol ) , where is the constitutional authorization today for the federal prohibition of mere possession of cocaine today ? "
The judge did n’t take to the question well .
He said that I got the history wrong .
( I did n’t . )
He said that the juror " had exceeded his authority " in questioning the constitutionality of a law , and reasserted that federal cocaine possession bans were constitutional .
He did not cite any constitutional provision in his reply to the question .
In effect , he said it ’s constitutional " because I said so . "
I did n’t bring in my copy of the Constitution into the court because of the judge ’s instructions not to " go into lawbooks . "
Of course , I did n’t need to bring a copy for myself , because I ’ve long had it virtually memorized .
Too bad the Constitution was n’t in a picture frame on the wall .
We ’d have had a jury moment then !
Then , the jury deliberated for a while to see if they might all agree with me anyway , but it was soon clear that most jurors favored a guilty verdict .
Later in the day , after it became clear I could possibly deadlock the jury , another juror wrote two questions to the judge which are to this effect :
If a juror refuses to consider the facts of the case and rejects the validity of the court and the venue for this trial because of a belief in the unconstitutionality of drug laws , can he be considered a valid juror ?
Can a jury with such a juror be considered a properly constituted jury ?
I did not object to the other juror asking the question , though I told him I disagreed with his characterization of my views .
I do n’t question the validity of the court , or of any case being made .
All I ’m saying is that there ’s only one verdict to be rendered under the circumstances .
Soon we were back in the courtroom — again — and for the first and only time in the case the judge was livid .
He said that in 30 years of service on the court he had never heard of such a case or question on the jury .
He said he ’d confer with his peers ( other judges ) on the options , but did say that the jury was properly constituted and the juror , The Wrinkle , was a properly constituted juror .
All the junior legal researchers were in court at a special table over where they hold the sidebar conferences so they could witness the spectacle close - up .
Judge Young said something along the likes of " When you set aside the law and the Constitution for your own preferences , you undercut our whole system of government . "
Ummm … yeah , I thought .
You would be , if you set aside the Constitution .
But what if you uphold the clear and unequivocal language of the Constitution ?
The judge continued his rant declaring that by reading the U.S. Constitution " You are exercising judgment that is beyond your competency . "
Though as an educator I know the U.S. Constitution was written to the 11th grade vocabulary level , I strongly believe he did n’t intend it as a personal insult .
Judge Young ’s position was that jurors are fully capable of interpreting heavy Mafia code language and deciphering the subtle inflection of drug dealers ’ voices over a wire - tapped phone , but that jurors are " beyond their competency " in reading straightforward English prose written to the 11th grade vocabulary level .
It ’s also possible he believes that the 18th - century farmers who wrote the text put some secret Gnostic code into the text of the Constitution that we plebes would n’t understand .
That ’s not exactly the kind of thing farmers are known to do , though , and there ’s no historical evidence of it .
He also said that by judging the law — as he related it to me , which included the Constitution — that " You are taking authority that was not given to you . "
Remember , my oath was to judge the " facts and the law . "
My view is that the law , as presented by the judge , included the U.S. Constitution .
I made the " logical conclusion " that the Constitution is the " highest law in the land , " which every schoolboy knows .
It would be illogical to conclude a judge ’s other instructions supersede the clear and unequivocal language of the U.S. Constitution .
The day ended in court with the judge ’s answer of the juror ’s questions , and his pledge to consult other jurists about this " new wrinkle , " as he put it .
I wonder what the Korean guy was thinking by this point .
( My guess : " America really has become a third - world country . " )
The next day we traipsed into the courtroom at about 9:30 to hear the judge ’s report .
He reiterated ( much more briefly ) his charge from yesterday afternoon , and then sent us back into the jury room with the instruction that if we were to have the same problem that we should send him a note saying we have the same problem .
It did n’t take a second for me and the other jurors to say in unison " Send the note ! "
So we once again marched into the courtroom , junior legal clerks now in the area of the courtroom reserved for visitors , and the judge said he ’d interview us individually and ask us two questions : " Will you be able to fulfill your oath as a juror to apply the laws as I instruct you ? "
( " Yes , " I could answer , because he has explained the U.S. Constitution ) and " Could you start your deliberations fresh ? "
( Assuming a juror were removed ) .
After the foreman went in to talk with the judge — less than two minutes — it was my turn .
I gave an affirmative to his first question , which was exactly the question he said it would be , and then added : " But I think I can clarify .
I ’m the one who asked the first question , and I ’m the one about whom the juror asked the second question , though I disagree with all of the characterizations in the question . "
I explained how I came to where I am : " I talked about the Constitution because you had introduced it into the case , your honor .
Right after we took our oaths to judge the case according to the u2018 facts and the law ’ as described by you , you launched into a detailed description of the Constitution .
You described the First Article and how it established Congress , the second article and the presidency and the third article and the judiciary .
You even made a point of calling us Constitutional officers , and I took that discussion seriously .
Every schoolboy knows that the Constitution is the highest law in the land . "
What followed was a fifteen - minute sparring match where he attempted to get me to say that I " interpret " — a favorite word of judges — the Constitution the way I want .
But nobody in the room was fooled .
It was clear to everybody that the sole reason I was in the room was because I had refused to become a constitutional " interpreter . "
" Your honor , I need an interpreter for a document written in Greek or Latin , because they are foreign languages .
But the Constitution is written in English , my native tongue , and as an educator I know that it is written to the 11th grade vocabulary level .
We do n’t need to interpret simple declarative English sentences of the Constitution .
We can simply read them . "
I told him that the words in the Constitution have a specific meaning that are independent of how I may or may not want them to mean .
" Words have specific meaning , " I said several times .
We discussed my first question to the judge from the jury room ( about the 18th Amendment ) — " I do n’t understand the point of this … " he said .
I explained .
" If Congress felt they did n’t have the power to ban a drug — alcohol — in 1918 without amending the Constitution , how is it that the Congress has the power to do exactly the same thing now without a constitutional amendment ? "
He explained that the power of Congress to ban substances within a state was " authorized by the commerce clause of the Constitution . "
So then we discussed the grammar of the clause , or I did anyway … to no conclusion .
He seemed to assume that the word " among " was a synonym of the word " inside " or " within , " a definition not found in any definition ever printed in any English dictionary ever printed and not found in the language of the Founders .
The judge was more interested in past court precedents than the actual language of the Constitution .
The text of the Constitution was n’t on his tongue ; what mattered was past court precedents .
They were , as far as I could tell , infallible .
I wonder if he would try to defend Plessy v. Ferguson .
Then he played the Reagan Republican card : " Would you say that Congress has sometimes gone too far , as happened in the Lopez case ? " he asked , explaining the case to me ( I remembered the case , but had forgotten the name of the case until reminded . )
I told him that I thought that my role was to decide the facts against the law as he described in this case .
He asked me if the judge cannot instruct the jury on the law , and I replied : " No , your honor , the judge must instruct the jury on the statutes and the precedents .
They are very complex . "
The judge had earlier used the term " teacher " of the law to describe his role .
He was going far beyond the teacher role now , but I think that would be a fair assessment of the proper role of a judge .
" And the Constitution ? " he asked next .
" You ’ve already presented it to us , " I replied .
So then I was sent out of the room and the lawyers crafted a question for me to answer .
The question — a second oath , really — that I was asked to affirm was , near as I can remember , this : " Would you be able to set aside your own reading of the Constitution , the judge ’s past instructions and judge the facts based solely upon the judge ’s explanation of the law ? "
I said that I did n’t " understand what was meant by u2018reading . ’
The words of the Constitution mean what they mean . "
I really think I was being asked that if I were to read the word " red , " and the judge instructed me to hear the word " blue , " I must act as if the word were blue .
As to the second part , I regarded it as a question that demanded I set aside my common sense .
What if the judge had issued a direction on the law that all Italians are guilty ?
Had I taken this second oath , I would have felt bound to have my role limited to simply determining if the defendant were Italian .
I would have been bound to vote guilty if the judge had said " the law says that if the sun rose today , then the defendant is guilty . "
It struck me as going too far .
It went too far probing into the minds of jurors , too far outside of the law of common sense , and probably too far legally for a judge to demand such fealty as a condition of jury service .
I told them that I did n’t know if I could answer " yes " to the question .
It was , in effect , a " no . "
They kicked me out of the room to finalize my dismissal , called me back and politely dismissed me .
I never wanted to get on any jury anyway , and only responded to the summons because it threatened prison and fines for non-compliance .
Now I know what to say to the next judge who tries to put me on a jury : " I ’m not a qualified juror because I have memorized the U.S. Constitution , read English and believe in an objective reality . "
That ’s guaranteed to get me off !
Note :
The quotes in this report are based upon my best memory of the events that occurred , as I wrote them down the evenings after the court sessions .
There are bound to be a few slight — very slight ! — differences in language between the quotes above and the official court transcript .
If there is a discrepancy , I am sure the official transcript is the more accurate of the two accounts .
I have n’t seen the official transcript , but I am certain that there would be no substantial difference between my recollection and the official transcript .
The Best of Thomas R. Eddlem
The numbers are in on 2007 's music sales in the US and Britain , and things still are n't looking good .
Digital sales may have seen an impressive spike over 2006 , but CD sales continued their downward spiral , and the traditional " album " is being subverted by a new age of " pick and choose " purchasing models .
In both the US and Britain , digital sales saw nearly a 50 percent boost over the 2006 numbers .
844.2 million digital tracks were moved in the US and another 77 million in the UK .
While this is good news in the face of physical CD sales that declined by 14 percent from 2006 , the more significant issue at stake here is the decline of full album sales .
With digital stores allowing customers to purchase just the tracks they want , record labels may have to be content with lowered revenues as people reject the high prices and fluff tracks found in all too many albums .
Further contributing to the decline of full album sales is the beginning of the end of DRM on music .
New services like iTunes Plus and Amazon 's MP3 Downloads store attract more customers by offering music that plays on every device ( good for consumers ! ) , but those buyers seem happy to snap up individual tracks instead of albums ( bad for labels ! ) .
Still , labels now have the possibility to move move music in total by appealing to those who would never have purchased a whole album but are happy to pick up a hit single for a buck .
Of course , the rise of movies and TV shows on DVD , as well as the the potential for video games to be twice as big as music by 2011 , are n't doing any favors for music sales .
As consumer entertainment needs diversify , " long tail " models can prosper as " mainstream " business models stagnate .
As customers gain more power and choice over what music they buy and how they enjoy it , the labels are simply going to have to adjust for a new pro-consumer age .

USB stick RAID in ACTION !
Warning .
Attempting similar projects at home may cause feelings of grandiosity .
Introduction
RAIDs ( Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive [ sic ] Disks ) are considered pretty handy for a number of things .
This is an example of productive and practical use of a RAID .
Granted , this project does not have the archaic grandeur of a Floppy Disk RAID , but then again , the capacity and performance of this system are utterly superior to those of a Floppy Disk RAID .
The following is meant as an instruction sheet of how to build a rock - hard USB stick RAID system and simultaneously transform from an ordinary nerd to a SUPER LINUX GURU .
Ingredients
There is no unequivocal agreement between chefs de computing cuisine about the ingredients required for a USB stick RAID , but with this kind of a recipe one can easily make good use of a half an hour of time and about fifty hard - earned euros .
A computer with a USB port ( no monitor or other sissy stuff needed )
Gentoo Linux with some nerdtweaks
A USB HUB
Three ( 3 ) USB sticks : the sticks used in this utility are 128 M sticks of different brands
Single lifestyle
Set -up
Well , the hardware set - up is quick but you can still get your hands dirty : plug - in the HUB and the sticks and take a sip of Coke .
However , because you 're running GNU / Linux and not Windows , prepare to spend two days in figuring out how to make ALL the different brands of USB sticks work .
Oh yeah , do n't forget to compile the RAID modules to the kernel while doing your daily tweak .
Figure 1 : Stick'em in
When you can make all the USB sticks flash their tiny led - eyes , you know you 're ready to go .
First , tell the ordinary USB sticks to transform into mighty Linux Raid Autodetect sticks ( notice the author 's deep thought in naming his computer ) :
root@dragon mmeri # fdisk / dev/ubb Command ( m for help ) : p Disk / dev/ubb : 131 MB , 131072000 bytes 32 heads , 32 sectors / track , 250 cylinders Units = cylinders of 1024 * 512 = 524288 bytes Device Boot Start End Blocks
Id System / dev/ubb1 1 250 127984 fd Linux raid autodetect Command ( m for help ) : q root@dragon mmeri #
Then , command your sticks to regroup into a RAID device .
IMHO there 's no difference between the coolness of different RAID levels : no matter which one you choose for your server , it tells equally good a story about the extent of your social life .
So in the following we create ( - C ) verbosely ( - v ) a device ( / dev/md0 ) with RAID level 5 ( - l=5 ) out of three ( - n=3 ) devices ub a1 , ubb1 , and ubc1 .
Tell yourself , THIS ROCKS !
root@dragon mmeri # mknod / dev/md0 b 9 0 root@dragon mmeri # mdadm - C -v /dev/md0 - l=5 -n=3 /dev/uba1 /dev/ubb1 /dev/ubc1 mdadm : layout defaults to left - symmetric mdadm : chunk size defaults to 64 K mdadm : size set to 125824 K mdadm : largest drive ( / dev/ubb1 ) exceed size ( 125824 K ) by more than 1 % Continue creating array ?
Yes mdadm : array / dev/md0 started .

Now you 've actually turned your three slack USB sticks into a SUPER COOL RAID device !
A trick that leaves Copperfield dumbstruck and wins you the chicks .
Trust me , I 'm almost a doctor .
Then , grab another 1.5L Coke ( I know you 've got one if you 've read it this far ) , and format and mount your new beauty :
root@dragon mmeri # mke2fs / dev/md0 mke2fs 1.35 ( 28 - Feb -2004 ) Filesystem label= OS type : Linux Block size =1024 ( log=0 ) Fragment size =1024 ( log=0 ) 62992 inodes , 251648 blocks 12582 blocks ( 5.00 % ) reserved for the super user

This filesystem will be automatically checked every 30 mounts or 180 days , whichever comes first .
Use tune2 fs -c or - i to override .
root@dragon mmeri # mount / dev/md0 / mnt/usbraid / root@dragon mmeri #
Drink the coke and relax reading hex dumps while the USB sticks on the HUB blink like a computer geek 's star constellation ( see the stunning movie1 or movie2 ) .
This 'll take a while .
When the formatting is finally done , observe the tremendous capacity that your new fault - tolerant device has ( even more than this if you do n't use RAID5 ) -- 231 M should be enough for anybody !
Also notice how the performance of your system KICKS ASS !

Sit back , take a sip of coke , and congratulate yourself .
You are COOL DUDE .
Performance
This sorta record - cracking system surely cries to be tested for performance .
The tools used in this test are special UNIX tools developed for system testing : date , cp , and umount .
( Wizards time less , date more .
And what 's a hdparm ? )
First , we 'll copy a file of size 221 M on the RAID apparatus ( write performance ) , while measuring the time , and then copy it back ( read performance ) :

Conclusion
As RAID technology is meant only for serious computer - wizards who know stuff , the USB stick RAID will , unfortunately , remain a curiosity in the field of computing .
Pity , especially if one considers the almost endless productive uses that this face - meltingly - fast technology could be harnessed for .
Pack in the almost endless capacity , and you have a cool fault - tolerant data storage device .
Next in series : 5.25 " Floppy disk RAID :
With the inexpensive technology , is this a respectable competitor for USB stick RAID ?

Station crew OK after Soyuz capsule lands short of target
BY WILLIAM HARWOOD
STORY WRITTEN FOR CBS NEWS " SPACE PLACE " & USED WITH PERMISSION
Posted : April 19 , 2008
Expedition 16 commander Peggy Whitson , Soyuz commander Yuri Malenchenko and South Korean guest cosmonaut So - Yeon
Yi undocked from the international space station and returned to Earth around 4:30 a.m. EDT to close out a successful 192 - day mission .
Because of an unexplained problem of some sort , the Soyuz capsule came down well short of its intended touchdown site just north of Arkalyk , Kazakhstan , unseen and out of immediate contact with recovery forces .
But within the hour , recovery teams were on the scene and the crew was reported to be in good condition .
" Recovery forces , at least two helicopters , are in route , " reported NASA commentator John Ira Petty , monitoring the descent from mission control at the Johnson Space Center in Houston .
" There are indications the spacecraft could have landed well short of that targeted site .
One possibility that has been raised is that of a ballistic entry .
That could have occasioned such a shortfall .
Again , no indication that anything is amiss with the spacecraft . "
A few moments later , Petty reported acquisition of the Soyuz capsule 's landing beacon and Russian flight controllers told the space station 's crew Whitson and company had landed 295 miles west of the intended landing site .
" Station , Moscow , on SG - 1 for landing , " a flight controller called from Moscow .
" Go ahead .
I 'm all ears , " said station commander Sergei Volkov .
" Sergei , the latest information from the search and rescue , Yuri contacted them using the satellite phone and you can hear applause in the control room .
They are feeling fine .
They are short of the landing zone by 475 kilometers . "
" Why so much ? " Volkov asked .
" Well , they 'll figure it out , " mission control replied .
" It looks like a ballistic descent . "
NASA spokesman Rob Navias , with Russian recovery forces in Arkalyk , said the crew was in " good shape . "
Chief astronaut Steve Lindsey said the steeper - than - normal descent was reminiscent of the Expedition 6 landing in May 2003 and a similar shortfall during the most recent previous landing .
" We did n't hear from them for a while so we were concerned , " Lindsey said .
" But eventually we did get word that they located them so that 's real good news .
...
They were well ready for this and in fact , Yuri did call in on the sat phone after they landed just to let the rescue forces who did n't see them come down , to let them know the crew is OK . "
At a Russian news conference , Russian officials said the crew was in good health after a " controlled , ballistic descent .
The crew feels great , all of them .
...
The reasons for the ballistic descent will be investigated after the descent module will be delivered to the Energia Corporation . "
Whitson now holds the U.S. endurance record with a cumulative 377 days in space during two station expeditions .
She broke the previous U.S. mark of 374 days on Wednesday , eclipsing a record set by astronaut Mike Foale .
Whitson now ranks 20th in the world for space endurance and 16th on the list of most experienced spacewalkers .
She carried out one spacewalk during her first flight in 2002 and five during Expedition 16 for a total of 39 hours and 46 minutes .
Malenchenko , completing his fourth space flight , moves up to ninth on the space endurance list with 515 days aloft .
" I 'd love to fly again , especially if we were going somewhere like the moon or Mars , " Whitson told CBS Radio in an interview Wednesday .
" I would actually be happy to come here and fly on the station again .
It 's a very long training flow and that 's , I think , the hardest thing to overcome , getting my arms around the idea of going through another training flow .
Because additional international partners means it 's a lot of travel and it's a very long flow , usually three to five years . "
But Whitson said she had no regrets , and enjoyed her first six - month flight in 2002 as much as her second .
" I had a phenomenal time the first time around , " Whitson said .
" There is only one first time , there 's a lot more discovery that happened on the first trip , being up here , and I think time felt like it flew by , literally .
I mean , it felt like I was here on my first trip about two months when I was here six .
And on this trip , I would say six months seemed about like six months and so , it 's a little more expeditionary this time around .
But if you 're not having a good time , I guess you 're just not doing the right thing because we have a blast up here . "
Whitson , Malenchenko and Yi undocked from the downward - facing port of the Russian Zarya module at 1:06:30 a.m. , leaving Expedition 17 commander Sergei Volkov , flight engineer Oleg Kononenko and NASA astronaut Garrett Reisman behind aboard the international lab complex .
Volkov , Kononenko and Yi , South Korea 's first space flier , were launched April 8 aboard the Soyuz TMA - 12 spacecraft that remains docked to the station 's Pirs airlock module .
Reisman , ferried to the station aboard the shuttle Endeavour in March , plans to return to Earth aboard shuttle Discovery in early June .
With Malenchenko at the controls , assisted by Whitson in the left seat , the Soyuz TMA - 11 spacecraft fired its braking rockets at 3:40 a.m. for about four - and - a - half minutes , slowing the craft enough to plunge back into the atmosphere .
Three minutes before atmospheric entry around 4:06 a.m. , the descent module carrying the crew separated from the craft 's orbit and propulsion modules .
Seven minutes later , the returning station fliers experienced maximum deceleration followed by the command to open the craft 's parachutes beginning around 4:15 a.m.
Ground controllers , however , did not establish contact with the capsule until after landing .
During Expedition 16 , Whitson , Malenchenko and rotating crew members Clay Anderson , Dan Tani , European Space Agency astronaut Leopold Eyharts and Reisman oversaw a major growth spurt in station construction with the addition of the Harmony connecting module , the European Columbus research lab , a Japanese logistics module and the relocation of a huge set of solar arrays .
When the arrays were re-extended , torn blankets and seams caused a major concern .
But the problem was resolved when a spacewalking shuttle astronaut successfully stitched the torn blankets together .
" Some of my proudest moments of this mission have been how we 've handled the problems that have come up , " Whitson said .
" Fixing the solar arrays , the team on the ground really , really pushed hard to come up with a solution to fix that solar array and I was very worried about it , because I knew that we would n't be able to add additional modules without that power capability .
I was really , really proud of our teams on the ground , proud of the team up here that made it happen . "
Asked what she was looking forward to the most back on Earth , besides reunions with friends and family , Whitson said " I 'm excited about having a little bit more selection in food and being able to actually cook something instead of eating something out of a bag .
And I 'm also looking forward , I really like working in my garden and planting flowers .
It 's the right time of year in Houston to be doing that , so I 'm looking forward to doing that , get a little extra rehab in that way . "
Whitson 's first trip to and from the station was aboard a space shuttle .
This time around , she rode the Soyuz TMA - 11 spacecraft into orbit and will make the trip back to Earth flying in the left seat , assisting Malenchenko .
" I 'm the left - seat flight engineer and it's very involved , it 's more involved than I ever would have been , for instance , on a shuttle mission , " she told CBS News last year .
" I was pretty impressed with the training program , that they 're able to teach a biochemist in Russian how to be a left - seat engineer .
So it was very challenging for me , but I think it 's going to be very satisfying because of the challenge . "
Before her launch last October , Whitson said she did not view herself as a role model .
But she said she hoped her story might encourage other women to pursue careers in science and engineering .
" I want to encourage any child to do their best at anything , " she said .
" Coming from a background , rural Iowa , raised with more hogs than people , I do n't know that I knew all the choices out there .
But something struck me about exploration of the moon , and I hope that even if I do n't inspire somebody to be an astronaut that I inspire them to be an engineer or to do something more than they thought they could .
That would be very important to me . "
During a brief change - of - command ceremony Thursday , Whitson formally handed over the station to Volkov .
" I 'm officially handing over the international space station to Sergei Volkov , " she said .
" I 'm very happy to do so .
Expedition 16 has consisted of a lot of crew members , some who are here , some who are not - Clay Anderson , Dan Tani , Leo Eyharts , Yuri and Garrett and myself - and we 've had the really great privilege and honor to be here on the station when so much has changed .
We feel like we have handed over a very beautiful station to you guys and look forward to your work .
I know that you 're going to be a great commander , Sergei . "
" Thank you very much , " replied Volkov , son of a Russian cosmonaut .
" Expedition 17 takes the station under our control and thank you very much for such a precious station , a beautiful station , and we wish you have a safe trip back home and good luck . "
Whitson then jokingly offered Volkov and Kononenko two parting gifts , the first one being Reisman .
" He 's going to be a great addition to your crew , " Whitson laughed .
" And the second gift , which is almost as important as Garrett , is the left over ( hot ) sauce ! "
" Thank you !
Thank you ver much ! "
Volkov said .
" You 're in control now , " Whitson said .
" You have the sauce . "

The Hamas leader Ahmed Yousef did Barack Obama no favor recently when he said : “ We like Mr. Obama and we hope that he will win the election . ”
John McCain jumped on this statement , calling it a “ legitimate point of discussion , ” and tied it to Obama ’s putative softness on Iran , whose ever - charming president last week called Israel a “ stinking corpse ” and predicted its “ annihilation . ”
The Hamas episode wo n’t help Obama ’s attempts to win over Jewish voters , particularly those in such places as –- to pull an example from the air –- Palm Beach County , Florida , whose Jewish residents tend to appreciate robust American support for Israel , and worry about whether presidential candidates feel the importance of Israel in their kishkes , or guts .
Obama and I spoke over the weekend about Hamas , about Jimmy Carter , and about the future of Jewish settlements on the West Bank .
He seemed eager to talk about his ties to the Jewish community , and about the influence Jews have had on his life .
Among other things , he told me that he learned the art of moral anguish from Jews .
We spoke as well about my Atlantic cover story on Israel ’s future .
He mentioned his interest in the opinions of the writer David Grossman , who is featured in the article .
“ I remember reading The Yellow Wind when it came out , and reading about Grossman now is powerful , painful stuff . ”
And , speaking in a kind of code Jews readily understand , Obama also made sure to mention that he was fond of the writer Leon Uris , the author of Exodus .
Here are excerpts from our conversation :
JEFFREY GOLDBERG : I ’m curious to hear you talk about the Zionist idea .
Do you believe that it has justice on its side ?
BARACK OBAMA : You know , when I think about the Zionist idea , I think about how my feelings about Israel were shaped as a young man -- as a child , in fact .
I had a camp counselor when I was in sixth grade who was Jewish - American but who had spent time in Israel , and during the course of this two - week camp he shared with me the idea of returning to a homeland and what that meant for people who had suffered from the Holocaust , and he talked about the idea of preserving a culture when a people had been uprooted with the view of eventually returning home .
There was something so powerful and compelling for me , maybe because I was a kid who never entirely felt like he was rooted .
That was part of my upbringing , to be traveling and always having a sense of values and culture but wanting a place .
So that is my first memory of thinking about Israel .
And then that mixed with a great affinity for the idea of social justice that was embodied in the early Zionist movement and the kibbutz , and the notion that not only do you find a place but you also have this opportunity to start over and to repair the breaches of the past .
I found this very appealing .
JG : You ’ve talked about the role of Jews in the development of your thinking
BO : I always joke that my intellectual formation was through Jewish scholars and writers , even though I did n’t know it at the time .
Whether it was theologians or Philip Roth who helped shape my sensibility , or some of the more popular writers like Leon Uris .
So when I became more politically conscious , my starting point when I think about the Middle East is this enormous emotional attachment and sympathy for Israel , mindful of its history , mindful of the hardship and pain and suffering that the Jewish people have undergone , but also mindful of the incredible opportunity that is presented when people finally return to a land and are able to try to excavate their best traditions and their best selves .
And obviously it ’s something that has great resonance with the African - American experience .
One of the things that is frustrating about the recent conversations on Israel is the loss of what I think is the natural affinity between the African - American community and the Jewish community , one that was deeply understood by Jewish and black leaders in the early civil - rights movement but has been estranged for a whole host of reasons that you and I do n’t need to elaborate .
JG : Do you think that justice is still on Israel ’s side ?
BO : I think that the idea of a secure Jewish state is a fundamentally just idea , and a necessary idea , given not only world history but the active existence of anti-Semitism , the potential vulnerability that the Jewish people could still experience .
I know that that there are those who would argue that in some ways America has become a safe refuge for the Jewish people , but if you ’ve gone through the Holocaust , then that does not offer the same sense of confidence and security as the idea that the Jewish people can take care of themselves no matter what happens .
That makes it a fundamentally just idea .
That does not mean that I would agree with every action of the state of Israel , because it ’s a government and it has politicians , and as a politician myself I am deeply mindful that we are imperfect creatures and do n’t always act with justice uppermost on our minds .
But the fundamental premise of Israel and the need to preserve a Jewish state that is secure is , I think , a just idea and one that should be supported here in the United States and around the world .
JG : Go to the kishke question , the gut question : the idea that if Jews know that you love them , then you can say whatever you want about Israel , but if we do n’t know you –- Jim Baker , Zbigniew Brzezinski –- then everything is suspect .
There seems to be in some quarters , in Florida and other places , a sense that you do n’t feel Jewish worry the way a senator from New York would feel it .
BO : I find that really interesting .
I think the idea of Israel and the reality of Israel is one that I find important to me personally .
Because it speaks to my history of being uprooted , it speaks to the African - American story of exodus , it describes the history of overcoming great odds and a courage and a commitment to carving out a democracy and prosperity in the midst of hardscrabble land .
One of the things I loved about Israel when I went there is that the land itself is a metaphor for rebirth , for what ’s been accomplished .
What I also love about Israel is the fact that people argue about these issues , and that they ’re asking themselves moral questions .
Sometimes I ’m attacked in the press for maybe being too deliberative .
My staff teases me sometimes about anguishing over moral questions .
I think I learned that partly from Jewish thought , that your actions have consequences and that they matter and that we have moral imperatives .
The point is , if you look at my writings and my history , my commitment to Israel and the Jewish people is more than skin - deep and it ’s more than political expediency .
When it comes to the gut issue , I have such ardent defenders among my Jewish friends in Chicago .
I do n’t think people have noticed how fiercely they defend me , and how central they are to my success , because they ’ve interacted with me long enough to know that I 've got it in my gut .
During the Wright episode , they did n’t flinch for a minute , because they know me and trust me , and they ’ve seen me operate in difficult political situations .
The other irony in this whole process is that in my early political life in Chicago , one of the raps against me in the black community is that I was too close to the Jews .
When I ran against Bobby Rush [ for Congress ] , the perception was that I was Hyde Park , I ’m University of Chicago , I ’ve got all these Jewish friends .
When I started organizing , the two fellow organizers in Chicago were Jews , and I was attacked for associating with them .
So I ’ve been in the foxhole with my Jewish friends , so when I find on the national level my commitment being questioned , it ’s curious .
JG : Why do you think Ahmed Yousef of Hamas said what he said about you ?
BO : My position on Hamas is indistinguishable from the position of Hillary Clinton or John McCain .
I said they are a terrorist organization and I ’ve repeatedly condemned them .
I ’ve repeatedly said , and I mean what I say : since they are a terrorist organization , we should not be dealing with them until they recognize Israel , renounce terrorism , and abide by previous agreements .
JG : Were you flummoxed by it ?
BO : I was n’t flummoxed .
I think what is going on there is the same reason why there are some suspicions of me in the Jewish community .
Look , we do n’t do nuance well in politics and especially do n’t do it well on Middle East policy .
We look at things as black and white , and not gray .
It ’s conceivable that there are those in the Arab world who say to themselves , “ This is a guy who spent some time in the Muslim world , has a middle name of Hussein , and appears more worldly and has called for talks with people , and so he ’s not going to be engaging in the same sort of cowboy diplomacy as George Bush , ” and that ’s something they ’re hopeful about .
I think that ’s a perfectly legitimate perception as long as they ’re not confused about my unyielding support for Israel ’s security .
When I visited Ramallah , among a group of Palestinian students , one of the things that I said to those students was : “ Look , I am sympathetic to you and the need for you guys to have a country that can function , but understand this : if you ’re waiting for America to distance itself from Israel , you are delusional .
Because my commitment , our commitment , to Israel ’s security is non-negotiable . ”
I ’ve said this in front of audiences where , if there were any doubts about my position , that ’d be a place where you ’d hear it .
When Israel invaded Lebanon two summers ago , I was in South Africa , a place where , obviously , when you get outside the United States , you can hear much more critical commentary about Israel ’s actions , and I was asked about this in a press conference , and that time , and for the entire summer , I was very adamant about Israel ’s right to defend itself .
I said that there ’s not a nation - state on Earth that would tolerate having two of its soldiers kidnapped and just let it go .
So I welcome the Muslim world ’s accurate perception that I am interested in opening up dialogue and interested in moving away from the unilateral policies of George Bush , but nobody should mistake that for a softer stance when it comes to terrorism or when it comes to protecting Israel ’s security or making sure that the alliance is strong and firm .
You will not see , under my presidency , any slackening in commitment to Israel ’s security .
JG : What do you make of Jimmy Carter ’s suggestion that Israel resembles an apartheid state ?
BO : I strongly reject the characterization .
Israel is a vibrant democracy , the only one in the Middle East , and there ’s no doubt that Israel and the Palestinians have tough issues to work out to get to the goal of two states living side by side in peace and security , but injecting a term like apartheid into the discussion does n’t advance that goal .
It ’s emotionally loaded , historically inaccurate , and it ’s not what I believe .
JG : If you become President , will you denounce settlements publicly ?
BO : What I will say is what I ’ve said previously .
Settlements at this juncture are not helpful .
Look , my interest is in solving this problem not only for Israel but for the United States .
JG : Do you think that Israel is a drag on America ’s reputation overseas ?
BO : No , no , no .
But what I think is that this constant wound , that this constant sore , does infect all of our foreign policy .
The lack of a resolution to this problem provides an excuse for anti-American militant jihadists to engage in inexcusable actions , and so we have a national - security interest in solving this , and I also believe that Israel has a security interest in solving this because I believe that the status quo is unsustainable .
I am absolutely convinced of that , and some of the tensions that might arise between me and some of the more hawkish elements in the Jewish community in the United States might stem from the fact that I ’m not going to blindly adhere to whatever the most hawkish position is just because that ’s the safest ground politically .
I want to solve the problem , and so my job in being a friend to Israel is partly to hold up a mirror and tell the truth and say if Israel is building settlements without any regard to the effects that this has on the peace process , then we ’re going to be stuck in the same status quo that we ’ve been stuck in for decades now , and that wo n’t lift that existential dread that David Grossman described in your article .
The notion that a vibrant , successful society with incredible economic growth and incredible cultural vitality is still plagued by this notion that this could all end at any moment -- you know , I do n’t know what that feels like , but I can use my imagination to understand it .
I would not want to raise my children in those circumstances .
I want to make sure that the people of Israel , when they kiss their kids and put them on that bus , feel at least no more existential dread than any parent does whenever their kids leave their sight .
So that then becomes the question : is settlement policy conducive to relieving that over the long term , or is it just making the situation worse ?
That ’s the question that has to be asked .
" I refused to go , but one man came to me and held me by my dress and took me into the bush far from the road .
His friends came , there were 10 of them .
They held me down and raped me one by one .
I could not flee .
They were big men .
Vestigial organs are parts of the body that once had a function but are now more - or - less useless .
Probably the most famous example is the appendix , though it is now an open question whether the appendix is really vestigial .
The idea that we are carrying around useless relics of our evolutionary past has long fascinated scientists and laypeople alike .
This week we tackle vestigial organs in a feature article that looks at how the idea has changed over the years , and how it has come under attack from creationists anxious to deny that vestigial organs ( and hence evolution ) exist at all .
To accompany the article , here is our list of the five organs and functions most likely to be truly vestigial .
Read the full article on vestigial organs
Vomeronasal organ
Rodents and other mammals secrete chemical signals called pheromones that carry information about their gender or reproductive state , and influence the behaviour of others .
Pheromones are detected by a specialised sensory system , the vomeronasal organ ( VNO ) , which consists of a pair of structures that nestle in the nasal lining or the roof of the mouth .
Although most adult humans have something resembling a VNO in their nose , neuroscientist Michael Meredith of Florida State University in Tallahassee has no hesitation in dismissing it as a remnant .
Advertisement
“ If you look at the anatomy of the structure , you do n’t see any cells that look like the sensory cells in other mammalian VNOs , ” he says .
“ You do n’t see any nerve fibres connecting the organ to the brain . ”
He also points to genetic evidence that the human VNO is non-functional .
Virtually all the genes that encode its cell - surface receptors – the molecules that bind incoming chemical signals , triggering an electrical response in the cell – are pseudogenes , and inactive .
So what about the puzzling evidence that humans respond to some pheromones ?
Larry Katz and a team at Duke University , North Carolina , have found that as well as the VNO , the main olfactory system in mice also responds to pheromones .
If that is the case in humans too then it is possible that we may still secrete pheromones to influence the behaviour of others without using a VNO to detect them .
Goose bumps
Though goose bumps are a reflex rather than a permanent anatomical structure , they are widely considered to be vestigial in humans .
The pilomotor reflex , to give them one of their technical names , occurs when the tiny muscle at the base of a hair follicle contracts , pulling the hair upright .
In birds or mammals with feathers , fur or spines , this creates a layer of insulating warm air in a cold snap , or a reason for a predator to think twice before attacking .
But human hair is so puny that it is incapable of either of these functions .
Goose bumps in humans may , however , have taken on a minor new role .
Like flushing , another thermoregulatory mechanism , they have become linked with emotional responses – notably fear , rage or the pleasure , say , of listening to beautiful music .
This could serve as a signal to others .
It may also heighten emotional reactions : there is some evidence , for instance , that a music - induced frisson causes changes of activity in the brain that are associated with pleasure .
Darwin ’s point
Around the sixth week of gestation , six swellings of tissue called the hillocks of Hiss arise around the area that will form the ear canal .
These eventually coalesce to form the outer ear .
Darwin ’s point , or tubercle , is a minor malformation of the junction of the fourth and fifth hillocks of Hiss .
It is found in a substantial minority of people and takes the form of a cartilaginous node or bump on the rim of their outer ear , which is thought to be the vestige of a joint that allowed the top part of the ancestral ear to swivel or flop down over the opening to the ear .
Technically considered a congenital defect , Darwin ’s point does no harm and is surgically removed for cosmetic reasons only .
However , the genetics behind it tells an interesting tale , says plastic surgeon Anthony Sclafani of the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary in New York City .
The trait is passed on according to an autosomal dominant pattern , meaning that a child need only inherit one copy of the gene responsible to have Darwin ’s point .
That suggests that at one time it was useful .
However , it also has variable penetration , meaning that you wo n’t necessarily have the trait even if you inherit the gene .
“ The variable penetration reflects the fact that it is no longer advantageous , ” Sclafani says .
Tail bone
A structure that is the object of reduced evolutionary pressure can , within limits , take on different forms .
As a result , one of the telltale signs of a vestige is variability .
A good example is the human coccyx , a vestige of the mammalian tail , which has taken on a modified function , notably as an anchor point for the muscles that hold the anus in place .
The human coccyx is normally composed of four rudimentary vertebrae fused into a single bone .
“ But it ’s amazing how much variability there is at this spot , ” says Patrick Foye , director of the Coccyx Pain Service at New Jersey Medical School in Newark .
Whereas babies born with six fingers or toes are rare , he says , the coccyx can and often does consist of anything from three to five bony segments .
What ’s more , there are more than 100 medical reports of babies born with tails .
This atavism arises if the signal that normally stops the process of vertebrate elongation during embryonic development fails to activate on time .
Wisdom teeth
Most primates have wisdom teeth ( the third molars ) but a few species , including marmosets and tamarins , have none .
“ These are probably evolutionary dwarfs , ” says anthropologist Peter Lucas of George Washington University , Washington DC .
He suggests that when the body size of mammals reduces rapidly their jaws become too small to house all their teeth , and overcrowding eventually results in selection for fewer or smaller teeth ( International Congress Series , vol 1296 , p 74 ) .
This seems to be happening in Homo sapiens .
Robert Corruccini of Southern Illinois University in Carbondale , says the problem of overcrowding has been exacerbated in humans in the past four centuries as our diet has become softer and more processed .
With less wear on molars , jaw space is at an even higher premium , “ so the third molars , the last teeth to erupt , run out of space to erupt ” , he says .
Not only are impacted wisdom teeth becoming more common , perhaps as many as 35 % of people have no wisdom teeth at all , suggesting that we may be on an evolutionary trajectory to losing them altogether .

I am in the process of writing a lengthy post on Executive Orders ( EO ) and our ever evaporating rights , but in the meantime , as I was reading ( and reading and reading ) hundreds of pages of EO ’s , something struck me which I thought might make interesting reading in the interim .
Please check back for the next installment of the EO signing party .
Today ’s post delves into recent US history as well as current events .
We ’ll start with a timeline of recent American history ( do n’t worry , there ’s no test ) :
September 11 , 2001 ; The day that changed everything .
As virtually everyone on the planet knows , America was attacked on September 11 , 2001 .
At that time , we had the support of practically every country on the globe .
Within days , we were told that nineteen terrorists , most from Saudi Arabia , crashed planes into the twin towers of the World Trade Center killing more than three thousand people .
We wanted , needed and deserved justice and revenge upon those who perpetrated this horrific event .
So , we bombed Afghanistan where many of these terrorists trained .
And the country cheered !
We ’re going to blow those bastards into oblivion , something they richly deserved .
Then , we went on to attack … Iraq .
Huh ?
But these terrorists were from Saudi Arabia .
I am jumping ahead of myself .
Let ’s return to the timeline .
May 6 , 2002 ; The day that changed America .
On December 21 , 2000 , President Clinton signed the Rome Statute ( with support of US elected officials ) to join the International Criminal Court – ICC – you know , those pesky people who hold international tribunals concerning Crimes Against Humanity at The Hague ) . ) .
What many do n’t know is that on May 6 , 2002 , The United States of America pulled out of the ICC .
Wonder why the United States of America pulled out of the ICC and how all this relates to Order , Acts and Lies ?
What might have happened to make the US feel the need to pull out of the ICC on May 6 , 2002 ?
Well , this might have something to do with that premature evacuation .
On February 7 , 2002 , Bush signed a secret Executive Order authorizing the use of torture .
Excerpts follow :
( An ) FBI e-mail — dated May 22 , 2004 — followed disclosures about abuse of Iraqi detainees at Abu Ghraib prison and sought guidance on whether FBI agents in Iraq were obligated to report the U.S. military ’s harsh interrogation of inmates when that treatment violated FBI standards but fit within the guidelines of a presidential executive order .
Last Friday , President G. W. Bush confirmed the report , stating matter - of - factly : “ I ’m aware our national security team met on this issue .
And I approved . ”
The May 2004 FBI e-mail stated that the FBI interrogation team in Iraq understood that despite revisions in the executive order that occurred after the furor over the Abu Ghraib abuses , the presidential sanctioning of harsh interrogation tactics had not been rescinded .
“ I have been told that all interrogation techniques previously authorized by the executive order are still on the table but that certain techniques can only be used if very high - level authority is granted , ” the author of the FBI e-mail said .
Prior to the news conference , the White House selectively declassified and released documents to reporters , including one dated Feb. 7 , 2002 , and signed by President G. W. Bush , that cited the Geneva Convention ’s rules about humane treatment of prisoners during conflicts .
Describing the contents of the Feb. 7 , 2002 , memo , Gonzales said , “ The president determined that Geneva does not apply with respect to our conflict with al - Qaeda .
More here , here , here and here .
As the details of who did what when vis -à - vis torture , the administration has acknowledged officials at the highest levels of government , all the way up to President G. W. Bush , discussing and approving the minute details of torture .
The high - level discussions about these “ enhanced interrogation techniques ” were so detailed , these sources said , some of the interrogation sessions were almost choreographed — down to the number of times CIA agents could use a specific tactic .
The advisers were members of the National Security Council ’s Principals Committee , a select group of senior officials who met frequently to advise President G. W. Bush on issues of national security policy .
The Principals Committee included Vice President Cheney , former National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice , Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Colin Powell , as well as CIA Director George Tenet and Attorney General John Ashcroft .
As the national security adviser , Rice chaired the meetings , which took place in the White House Situation Room and were typically attended by most of the principals or their deputies .
Secret Executive Orders ?
Say what ?
Open government has officially been declared dead and buried .
What ’s the White House ’s take on EO’s ?
At the hearing , a department official , John P. Elwood , disclosed a previously unpublicized method to cloak government activities .
Mr. Elwood acknowledged that the administration believed that the president could ignore or modify existing executive orders that he or other presidents have issued without disclosing the new interpretation .
Is n’t that special ?
So , the US pulls out of the ICC and who reports it ?
Well , not anyone in the US Corporate Media ( CM – while many call our media Mainstream , it is not .
With five mega corporations owning the vast majority of “ news ” in America , it ’s not the people ’s media any longer .
Proof ?
How many people know Obama ’s bowling score ?
How many know the specifics of his or Hillary ’s healthcare plans ?
How many people know the specifics of Paris Hilton driving drunk and going to jail ?
‘ Nuff said . )
But it was reported elsewhere in the world , at the BBC ( as linked below ) and here , here and here .
This from the BBC :
The United States has withdrawn from a treaty to establish an International Criminal Court ( ICC ) , provoking outrage from human rights organisations .
In a letter to the United Nations delivered on Monday , the US says it will not consider itself bound by the treaty – even though Bill Clinton signed up to it in 2000 .
The US has vehemently opposed the setting up of the ICC , fearing its soldiers and diplomats could be brought before the court which will hear cases of war crimes and crimes against humanity .
The Washington Working Group on the ICC – an umbrella group of organisations supporting the court – said withdrawing from the treaty was a “ rash action signalling to the world that America is turning its back on decades of US leadership in prosecuting war criminals since the Nuremberg trials . ”
US Secretary of State Colin Powell , announcing the decision on Sunday , said the court would undermine US judicial authority .
He said it would be accountable to no higher authority – including the UN Security Council – and would be able “ to second - guess the United States after we have tried somebody ” .
This is the letter sent to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan from Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security John R. Bolton ( who went on to become our Ambassador to the United Nations – more on this later ) :
Dear Mr. Secretary - General :
This is to inform you , in connection with the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court adopted on July 17 , 1998 , that the United States does not intend to become a party to the treaty .
Accordingly , the United States has no legal obligations arising from its signature on December 31 , 2000 .
The United States requests that its intention not to become a party , as expressed in this letter , be reflected in the depositary ’s status lists relating to this treaty .
Sincerely ,
S/John R. Bolton
August 3 , 2002 ; Threats , threats and more threats .
Not only did we pull out of the ICC , but we threatened to use force against anyone who might hold any American or friend of America if they are held for trials at The Hague .
U.S. President George Bush today signed into law the American Servicemembers Protection Act of 2002 , which is intended to intimidate countries that ratify the treaty for the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) .
The new law authorizes the use of military force to liberate any American or citizen of a U.S. - allied country being held by the court , which is located in The Hague .
This provision , dubbed the “ Hague invasion clause , ” has caused a strong reaction from U.S. allies around the world , particularly in the Netherlands .
On August 3 , 2002 , Bush authorized the use of military force to liberate any American or citizen of a U.S. - allied country being held by the ICC court .
Not only did we pull out of this treaty , threaten military force if anyone dare hold any American ( or US ally ) accountable for crimes against humanity , we threatened to pull US Dollars from more than 40 countries who support the ICC .
More than 40 countries around the world face losing hundreds of millions of dollars in military assistance on Tuesday , when a new U.S. law makes it illegal for the United States to give military aid to nations that support the International Criminal Court .
He then signed into law the American Servicemember ’s Protection Act , which enshrined his opposition to the court and set Tuesday ’s deadline , when countries must either sign an immunity agreement , promising not to turn Americans over to the court , or face the prospect of losing millions in military assistance .
An estimated 45 nations already have signed such immunity agreements .
But critics say the contracts contravene international law and those who sign them do so because the United States has threatened to withdraw essential aid .
“ The U.S. is preying on small , vulnerable , impoverished states that are hugely dependent on assistance — military , economic , political — from the United States , ” says Richard Dicker , director of the International Justice program at Human Rights Watch .
Take note that the US pulled out of the ICC before Congress giving the Authority to Use Military Force ( AUMF ) , before Powell spoke to the United Nations Security Council , before we Shock and Awed Iraq .
To say that they knew what they were going to do and that it would be against international law is probably a pretty safe statement .
But I am getting ahead of myself .
Let ’s return to the timeline .
October 16 , 2002 : The day the detente died .
On October 16 , 2002 , the US Congress voted to give the president Authority to Use Military Force against Iraq ( an amusing read , please click the link and read the AUMF for yourself ) – a country which had nothing to do with 9/11 because they were supposed to have Weapons of Mass Destruction which they could use at any time and we could n’t wait for the weapons inspectors to do their jobs because of the impending mushroom cloud which was imminent .
To quote President G. W. Bush :
Facing clear evidence of peril , we cannot wait for the final proof — the smoking gun — that could come in the form of a mushroom cloud .
February 5 , 2003 : Lying liars and the lies they tell .
On February 5 , 2003 , then Secretary of State Colin Powell spoke to the United Nations Security Council – much of what he said has since been debunked as , well , lies .
To quote former Secretary of State Colin Powell as he spoke to the UN Security Council :
The material I will present to you comes from a variety of sources .
Some are U.S. sources .
And some are those of other countries .
Some of the sources are technical , such as intercepted telephone conversations and photos taken by satellites .
Other sources are people who have risked their lives to let the world know what Saddam Hussein is really up to .
I cannot tell you everything that we know .
But what I can share with you , when combined with what all of us have learned over the years , is deeply troubling .
Did Iraq have WMD ?
If you ’ve never had the pleasure to read or watch Scott Ritter , the chief United Nations weapons inspector in Iraq throughout the 1990’s , and lifelong Republican , please do .
He repeatedly protested that there were no WMD in Iraq .
He ’s an amazing guy
[ YouTube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXtvcFym6n8&feature=related]
Here is a great link to several interviews with Scott Ritter .
Oh , he also says that the US is actively planning its bombing campaign against Iran .
Swell .
March 20 , 2003 : Bombings from heaven .
On March 20 , 2003 , we began combat operations on Iraq with a coldly named Shock and Awe campaign – dropping hundreds of bombs from the air , because Iraq had Weapons of Mass Destruction ( which they did n’t have ) .
We aggressively and preemptively started a war of choice with a sovereign nation .
Why did we decide to attack Iraq ?
While this could be a post all unto itself , we went to war because a group of Neo- conservatives calling themselves The Project for a New American Century ( PNAC ) wanted to .
This letter is from the PNAC to former President Clinton stating their desire to invade Iraq .
This is from the PNAC site :
The Project for the New American Century is a non-profit educational organization dedicated to a few fundamental propositions : that American leadership is good both for America and for the world ; and that such leadership requires military strength , diplomatic energy and commitment to moral principle .
For more on PNAC , please click this link .
It ’s appalling .
— — — ——— UPDATE 5/16/08 — — — ————-
Apparently , PNAC has neglected to pay its bills and its site has been suspended .
I am surprised that they did n’t do this long ago .
Since their own site was proof - positive of their plans for global domination , I always wondered why they kept it active .
Updated by MsJoanne : 5/16/08 4:22 PM
ET — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — ——
–
The only thing PNAC needed was , in their own words , “ a new Pearl Harbor ” ( page 63 ) to accomplish their dreams of American global domination .
Further , the process of transformation , even if it brings revolutionary change , is likely to be a long one , absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event – like a new Pearl Harbor .
Let ’s make that timeline a bit more easy to digest :
September 11 , 2001 : World Trade Center 1 and 2 attacked .
February 7 , 2002 : Bush signs secret EO authorizing torture .
May 6 , 2002 : US pulls out of the ICC .
August 3 , 2002 : US threatens nations who comply with ICC .
October 16 , 2002 : Congress approves AUMF against Iraq .
February 5 , 2003 : Powell lies to UN Security Council about WMD
March 20 , 2003 : US begins bombing Iraq .
Funny how we pull out of the ICC before weapons inspections are done , before we dropped the first bomb , and before we ever tortured anyone .
From the Harvard International Review :
No nation should ignore its duty to bring war criminals to justice or otherwise shield its own leaders or soldiers from charges of genocide , crimes against humanity , or war crimes .
Here is an interesting read on the ICC and the current political climate in the US .
I bet you are asking why I am bringing all of this up now ?
And what does this have to do with ( known ) Executive Orders ?
Yeah , I figured you ’d be asking that .
We ’ll now talk about the Acts , Orders and email .
Starting with Acts. specifically The Presidential Records Act .
This act :
Defines and states public ownership of the records .
Places the responsibility for the custody and management of incumbent Presidential records with the President .
Allows the incumbent President to dispose of records that no longer have administrative , historical , informational , or evidentiary value , once he has obtained the views of the Archivist of the United States on the proposed disposal .
Requires that the President and his staff take all practical steps to file personal records separately from Presidential records .
Establishes a process for restriction and public access to these records .
Specifically , the PRA allows for public access to Presidential records through the Freedom Of Information Act ( FOIA ) beginning five years after the end of the Administration , but allows the President to invoke as many as six specific restrictions to public access for up to twelve years .
The PRA also establishes procedures for Congress , courts , and subsequent Administrations to obtain special access to records that remain closed to the public , following a thirty - day notice period to the former and current Presidents ..
Requires that Vice - Presidential records are to be treated in the same way as Presidential records .
Hmmm , let me see if I have this straight .
Presidential records are owned by the public .
The incumbent president is responsible for managing these records according to this act .
Congress , the courts and subsequent administrations can obtain access to these records .
The Vice President of the US has to be treated the same as the president .
Ok , that sounds good .
Government is supposed to be transparent .
Congress is supposed to oversee the executive branch to ensure it is doing the right thing .
There is a limit to the secrecy any administration can operate under .
Cool .
Then , what happened to all the emails that were sent and received throughout all the time we were building our case for the war in Iraq ?
Uh , well , apparently the dog ate them .
The Bush administration has not found disaster recovery files for White House e-mails from a three - month time period in 2003 , according to court documents filed this week , raising the possibility that messages sent before and after the invasion of Iraq may never be recovered .
The White House chief information officer , Theresa Payton , said in a sworn declaration that the White House has identified more than 400 computer backup tapes from March through September of 2003 but that the earliest recorded file was dated May 23 of that year .
That period was one of the most crucial of the Bush presidency .
The United States launched the invasion of Iraq on March 20 , 2003 , and President G. W. Bush declared the end of major combat operations on May 1 .
Payton and other officials said that older e-mails could still be contained on the tapes because of the way the files are dated .
Or , in short :
“ The Bush administration has not found disaster recovery files for White House e-mails from a three - month time period in 2003 … raising the possibility that messages sent before and after the invasion of Iraq may never be recovered . ”
The White House claims a court proposal to search and preserve White House e-mail records would “ yield marginal benefits at best , while imposing substantial burdens and disruptions . ”
And then , there ’s this :
The head of the federal agency investigating Karl Rove ’s White House political operation is facing allegations that he improperly deleted computer files during another probe , using a private computer - help company , Geeks on Call .
Scott Bloch runs the Office of Special Counsel , an agency charged with protecting government whistleblowers and enforcing a ban on federal employees engaging in partisan political activity .
Mr. Bloch ’s agency is looking into whether Mr. Rove and other White House officials used government agencies to help re-elect Republicans in 2006 .
You can read more here and here .
At this point , I could get into the Hatch Act and politicizing our government , but I ’ll let you read about it yourself ( and perhaps I will do another post on it once more comes to light .
It ’s not enough that the US Attorney ’s office , EPA , FDA , EPA , and other agencies have become politicized – something deadly dangerous for every American [ think poisonous dog food and lead in our children ’s toys ] . )
For quite a long time , the National Archives and Records Administration had been trying to get the Reagan administrations records released , pursuant to The Presidential Records Act .
Well , the Bush administration , seeing no need for the American people ( you know , we the people who pay his salary ) to know what happened during Reagan ’s administration , pretty much gave the National Archives the finger .
First , rounds of letters asking for extensions for the release of the records went out , before Bush opted to end the whole thing by issuing another Executive Order : 13233 – Further Implementation of the Presidential Records Act .
This EO allows any former president – or anyone he may designate to respond for him , for all perpetuity – to say whether any of their records will be released , even if the current president says it ’s alright to release these records .
( ii ) If under the standard set forth in section 4 below , the incumbent President does not concur in the former President ’s decision to request withholding of the records as privileged , the incumbent President shall so inform the former President and the Archivist .
Because the former President independently retains the right to assert constitutionally based privileges , the Archivist shall not permit access to the records by a requester unless and until the incumbent President advises the Archivist that the former President and the incumbent President agree to authorize access to the records or until so ordered by a final and nonappealable court order .
Absent compelling circumstances , the incumbent President will concur in the privilege decision of the former President in response to a request for access under section 2204 ( c ) ( 1 ) .
This order does not expand or limit the incumbent President ’s right to obtain access to the records of a former President pursuant to section 2205 ( 2 ) ( B ) .
This order does not expand or limit the rights of a court , House of Congress , or authorized committee or subcommittee of Congress to obtain access to the records of a former President pursuant to section 2205 ( 2 ) ( A ) or section 2205 ( 2 ) ( C ) .
Oh and by the way , this applies to the Vice President , too .
Open government , my ass !
George W. Bush has just appointed himself president for life .
WTF ?
And why is Congress not objecting to these egregious EO’s ?
Well , that would be a good question .
See
It ’s not just Republicans that suck !

Welcome to Amerika .
Them soviets had nothing on this government !
Click it if you liked it ! : : : : : : : : : :
In a major turnaround , Mayor David Miller now says he supports removing a portion of the Gardiner Expressway to revitalize Toronto 's waterfront .
And he will probably have the votes to get it through city council , according to a prominent councillor not aligned with the mayor .
Waterfront Toronto , the government agency that manages much of the city 's lakefront , issued a news release last night saying it would outline plans today to tear down the Gardiner from Jarvis St. to the Don Valley Parkway to help " reconnect the city to its waterfront . "
More significant was a statement of support from Miller .
" This is the most practical approach and offers the greatest public benefits , " Miller was quoted as saying in the release .
" Removing the eastern section of the Gardiner is an affordable step that will allow us to develop the East Bayfront , Lower Don Lands and West Don Lands properly , while enhancing the public realm along Lake Shore and improving access to our waterfront .
We have already seen what can be done . "
Waterfront backers have made similar calls for years , but the fact that the mayor of Toronto , which owns the Gardiner , now supports the idea is a huge development in the history of the on- again , off - again argument to tear down all or part of the expressway .
The city should n't need provincial or federal approval to tear any of the road down .
But it might want to approach senior levels of government for financing help , and the province could have a role to play as part of an environmental assessment .
Critics have decried the Gardiner as an ugly relic , and claim it 's a barrier that blocks residents from enjoying the waterfront .
Supporters say the road remains an essential part of the city 's transportation fabric .
A report issued in 2006 suggested it would cost $ 758 million to tear down the highway from Spadina Ave. to the DVP , but it 's not clear how much less it would cost to take down just the portion east of Jarvis .
City Councillor Brian Ashton , who had a falling out with Miller and was booted from the mayor 's executive committee last year , called the latest news a stunning move by Miller .
" This will create considerable controversy but I think it will pass at council , " he said .
" The mayor can always win votes at council , but he needs to win the hearts of Torontonians , as well . "
Ashton said a partial removal of the Gardiner would be a major legacy for Miller .
" He 's good at stopping things , not necessarily starting things , " Ashton said .
" This would be a major step for him and a huge leap for the waterfront . "
Deputy mayor Joe Pantalone said he understands that a broad University Ave. style of road would be built at grade level to replace the Gardiner .
" This opens up the whole area , and with new projects coming on board such as East Bayfront and the Don Lands , the time to act is now .
It 's a very strategic part of the city . "
Pantalone said drivers should n't be adversely affected .
" Obviously we 'll have to wait for more details , but when we took down the Gardiner east of the Don River , all figures indicated there was minimal impact .
And we 're looking at a major , grand boulevard like University Ave. , which is beautiful .
And because it's at grade the upkeep would be a lot cheaper . "
" This is going to be a very expensive endeavour , " said councillor and Miller critic Denzil Minnan - Wong .
" Who 's going to pay for it ?
We already have a $ 300 million backlog in road repairs , so it 's logical to assume that this will come at a cost .
What roads will not be repaired or repaved that are already falling apart ? "
Reports on tearing down or burying or relocating the Gardiner have popped up as frequently over the years as potholes on Toronto streets .
Waterfront Toronto , then called the Toronto Waterfront Revitalization Corp. , issued a massive report in September 2006 that suggested higher gasoline taxes or road tolls might help to pay for a total or partial replacement of the Gardiner .
It also floated the idea of a property tax stream to finance the project , noting that improving the lakeshore corridor from east of Spadina would boost land values and thus generate more taxes .
" Frankly , I do n't see where the money is going to come from , " Miller said in 2006 .
" This has been way down on the priority list . "
Asked why Miller would suddenly support the idea , Minnan - Wong said he 'll have to hear what the mayor has to say .
" I do n't know , " he said .
" He spent millions on the 2006 report and it 's been sitting in a file cabinet for years .
Now , all of a sudden , there 's an announcement . "
The Waterfront Toronto board , of which Miller is a member , is slated to discuss the issue June 12 .
The idea would then go to city council 's executive committee , which Miller controls .
After that it would go to council , where Miller usually has enough votes to get major programs approved .

The news release from Waterfront Toronto said a " full environmental assessment " would be undertaken before any work begins .
That process is likely to take years , which could allow proposed transit improvements in the area to be put in place before the project would even start .

International groups have condemned the crackdown against the opposition .
President Hosni Mubarak 's ruling National Democratic Party has candidates for all 52,000 seats , and will be unopposed in 90 % of them , party sources say .
Correspondents say Egyptian municipal elections are rarely marked by controversy , but this year 's poll is the first since a constitutional amendment in 2005 which required presidential candidates to secure the backing of local councillors .
Other opposition groups complained of obstruction by the government , ranging from bureaucratic hurdles to assaults at registration stations .
More than 800 members of the Muslim Brotherhood group have been arrested in recent weeks .
The group says 2,664 of its candidates succeeded in obtaining court rulings ordering authorities to allow them to stand in the local election but the rulings were disregarded .
The Brotherhood says the government is eager to avoid another electoral setback after pro-Islamist independents won 20 % of seats in the last parliament .
The group is officially banned in Egypt , although its activities have been broadly tolerated .
Candidates for elections stand as independents .
They 're calling it bold , audacious and risky , a political milestone and the most important speech on American race relations since Martin Luther King , Jr. dreamed that his children might be judged by the contents of their character , rather than the colour of their skin .
But according to the pundits , the power of Barack Obama 's epochal " race address " will be gauged by " white males , especially working - class males " .
" Will it win over the blue - collar white males who have been trending toward his opponent , or drive them away ? " wondered Newsweek .
New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd quoted " a top pol " who felt that the controversy over Reverend Wright 's sermon had transformed Obama " in the minds of some working - class and crossover white voters from ' a Harvard law graduate into a South Side Black Panther ' " .
It sounds like the set - up to a joke , but it 's all too serious .
Question : what is the difference between a Harvard Law grad and a South Side militant ?
Answer : class .
Everywhere Obama is praised for " telling the truth about race " – but the success of his " race speech " is incessantly measured along class lines , because Obama actually charted a course through the crisscrossing lines of race and class , a complex social web that he described with great delicacy , but never came out and named .

What was most remarkable about this speech to my mind was not that Obama confronted race " head - on " ( although that has certainly become uncommon in recent years ) but that he repeatedly , and correctly , called race " a distraction , " on both sides of the colour line , from class issues : " Just as black anger often proved counter - productive , so have these white resentments distracted attention from the real culprits of the middle - class squeeze – a corporate culture rife with inside dealing , questionable accounting practices , and short - term greed ; a Washington dominated by lobbyists and special interests ; economic policies that favour the few over the many .
And yet , to wish away the resentments of white Americans , to label them as misguided or even racist , without recognising they are grounded in legitimate concerns – this too widens the racial divide . "
In one sense , Obama 's point could n't be clearer : race is a distraction from class - based inequities .
And if we dismiss working - class resentment as camouflaged racism , we will continue to be distracted by the spectre of race .
So why has no one noticed that the much - vaunted " race speech " is also a class speech ?
The answer to that is very complicated , but its roots may be traced in large part to what Obama referred to as the nation 's " original sin " of slavery .
In order to tell the truth about race in America , we need to tell the truth about slavery : which is that slavery was not racially motivated – it was economically motivated , and justified by means of race .
Race was invented in order to rationalise slavery : if black people are inferior , they deserve enslavement ( or so went the logic ) .
Racism is an effect of slavery , not the other way around .
Once slavery was abolished , not only did racism not disappear , neither did the economic system it upheld .
Slavery was simply replaced by a new feudal system known as sharecropping , which Jim Crow helped sustain .
The legacy of slavery comes from the sustained political , legal and economic effort to link permanently an entire group of people to poverty – and to mystify that systematic disenfranchisement by making up something called race , which could serve as a distraction .
Black people in America remain , to a large extent , an underclass .
But they are not co-extensive with the underclass .
There are rich , powerful black people ( take a bow , Condoleezza ) .
And we have a significant white underclass , too , one which has been given different names , in different colours – white trash , rednecks , blue - collar .
What they all share is the experience of economic deprivation , which is why 10 years ago Toni Morrison could call Bill Clinton " the first black president , " because , she said , he showed all the signs : " single - parent household , born poor , working - class , saxophone - playing , McDonald 's - and - junk - food - loving boy from Arkansas " .
The only sign he does n't show is colour : because race in America is overwhelmingly defined by economic conditions .
To be absolutely clear : I am not saying that race per se does n't exist , or is n't a problem in America .
On the contrary .
But we will never solve the problem of race in America until we do exactly what Obama suggests : see it for the distraction it is .
It was invented to deflect attention away from economic , legal and political inequalities .
And the longer that the Democrats ponder the complexities of identity politics , the more distracted they will become from the issues that are actually driving voters – including their utter disillusionment with the current administration and its catastrophic policies .
Democrats need to keep their eyes on the prize – beating McCain in November .
The irony is that Obama 's speech urging us not to be distracted by race has so far had quite the opposite effect .
Obama now needs to confront with equal candour the lesson we were taught by that " first black president " : it 's the economy , stupid .

To Whom It May Concern :
I worked for the company , Aerials Express , that produced the imagery with the so called “ pearl marks ” from 2002 - 2007 .
The aerial photographs were taken in the winter months , and when the negatives were scanned ( on a cool morning back in our office in Phoenix ) small drops of condensation had formed on the glass of the scanner .
These drops were so small , they went un -detected by the operator .
They were on the underside of the glass , and so appear to obscure the photograph .
At one point , I remember the CEO , Bill Lands , joking about them because a program from the Discovery Channel had contacted him directly .
He planned on releasing a PR piece with a picture of the scanner , and operator in an alien costume .
He had a great sense of humor .
Sorry to dispel the myth , just a bit of water under the scanner . ”
Well , he talks a good game , does n't he ?
John McCain gave a speech in New Mexico yesterday on Memorial Day :
It would be easier , much easier politically me to of joined Senator Webb in offering his legislation .
More importantly , I feel , just as he does , we owe the veterans the respect and generosity of a great nation because no matter how generously we show our gratitude , it will never compensate them fully for all of the sacrifices they have borne on our behalf .
The most important difference between our two approaches is that Senator Webb offers veterans who served one enlistment , the same benefits as those offered veterans who have reenlisted several times .
Our bill has a sliding scale .
It offers generous benefits to all veterans but increases those veterans ' benefits according to the veterans ' length of service .
It 's important to do that .
Because , otherwise , we will encourage more people to leave the military after they have completed one enlistment .
At a time when the United States military is fighting in two wars and we 're finally , finally beginning the long overdue and very urgent necessity of increasing the size of the army and marine corps , one study estimates that Senator Webb 's bill will reduce retention rates by 16 % .
Uh no .
John McCain is being dishonest ( * gasp ! * ) by selectively citing a CBO study on the impact of the bill .
McCain said the study concluded the bill would reduce retention by 16 percent .
What McCain failed to mention , however , is that same study determined that the Webb bill would offset that loss by boosting recruitment by 16 percent .
This is not the first time McCain , who has a proud history of opposing what he views as excessive government spending , has found himself at odds with his fellow veterans on legislation .
He 's voted for veterans funding bills only 30 % of the time , according to a scorecard of roll - call votes put out by the nonpartisan Disabled Americans for America .
Under the same system Obama has a 90 % rating — though , of course , he has spent a much shorter time in Washington .
" Senator McCain clearly needs to be recognized for his military service and in some respects that will play to his advantage , but when it actually comes to delivering health care and benefits during war , Senator McCain 's going to have some explaining to do , " said Paul Sullivan , director of the nonpartisan Veterans for Common Sense .
Supporters of Webb and Hagel 's bill dismiss McCain 's concerns about the retention issue .
While the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill would cause a 16 % drop in re-enlistment rates across all four branches of the military , the same study also predicts a 16 % uptick in new recruits attracted by the benefit .
The bill has 58 co-sponsors , including none other than Obama — just two shy of a veto - proof majority .
It was passed last week by the House with a comfortable veto - proof majority , but as an amendment to the emergency war supplemental , it could be altered as the two chambers hammer out differences between the two versions .
McCain 's office is confident that in the reconciliation process a compromise can be worked out .
" We 're negotiating in good faith and we think they are as well .
We want to do something for veterans .
We 're really working hard to accomplish our goal , " said Mark Buse , McCain 's Senate chief of staff .

The Fear Factor
by Ron Paul by Ron Paul
DIGG THIS
While fear itself is not always the product of irrationality , once experienced it tends to lead away from reason , especially if the experience is extreme in duration or intensity .
When people are fearful they tend to be willing to irrationally surrender their rights .
Thus , fear is a threat to rational liberty .
The psychology of fear is an essential component of those who would have us believe we must increasingly rely on the elite who manage the apparatus of the central government .
The statement  Those who would give up Essential Liberty to purchase a little Temporary Safety , deserve neither Liberty nor Safety  has been attributed to Benjamin Franklin .
It is clear , people seek out safety and security when they are in a state of fear , and it is the result of this psychological state that often leads to the surrender of liberty .
As Washington moves towards its summer legislative recess , indications of fear are apparent .
Things seem similar to the days before the war in Iraq .
Prior to the beginning of the war , several government officials began using phrases like we do n’t want the smoking gun to come in the form of a mushroom cloud ,  and they spoke of drone airplanes being sent to our country to do us great harm .
It is hard to overstate the damage this approach does psychologically , especially to younger people .
Of course , we now know there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq , let alone any capacity to put them to successful use .
To calm fears , Americans accepted the Patriot Act and the doctrine of pre-emptive war .
We tolerated new laws that allow the government to snoop on us , listen to our phone calls , track our financial dealings , make us strip down at airports and even limited the rights of habeas corpus and trial by jury .
Like some dysfunctional episode of the twilight zone , we allowed the summit of our imagination to be linked up with the pit of our fears .
Paranoia can be treated , but the loss of liberty resulting from the social psychology to which we continue to subject ourselves is not easily reversed .
People who would have previously battled against encroachments on civil liberties now explain the necessity  of those temporary security measures 
Franklin is said to have railed against .
Americans must reflect on their irrational fears if we are to turn the tide against the steady erosion of our freedoms .
Fear is the enemy .
The logically confusing admonition to fear only fear does not help ; instead , we must battle against irrational fear and the fear - mongers who promote it .
It is incumbent on a great nation to remain confident , if it wishes to remain free .
We need not be ignorant to real threats to our safety , against which we must remain vigilant .
We need only to banish to the ash heap of history the notion that we ought to be ruled by our fears and those who use them to enhance their own power .

The Best of Ron Paul
A dark pool of dried blood and a fallen red scarf mark the place where Ronak , who had fled to a woman 's shelter in the Kurdish city of Sulaymaniyah when she was accused of adultery by her husband , was shot three times by a man hiding on the roof of a nearby building .
Ronak was wounded by bullets in the neck , side and leg and only survived after a four - hour operation .
She was the latest victim of a huge increase across Iraq in the number of " honour " killings of women for alleged immorality by their own families .
Many are burnt to death by having petrol or paraffin poured over them and set ablaze .
Others are shot or strangled .
The United Nations estimates that at least 255 women died in honour - related killings in Kurdistan , home to one fifth of Iraqis , in the first six months of 2007 alone .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The murder of women who are deemed to have disobeyed traditional codes of morality is even more common in the rest of Iraq where government authority has broken down since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003 .
A surprising reason explaining the massive increase in the number of honour killings is the availability of cheap mobile phones able to take pictures .
Men photograph themselves making love to their girlfriends and pass the pictures to their friends .
This often turns out to be a lethal act of bravado in a society where premarital or extra-marital sex justifies killing .
The first known case of sex recorded on a mobile leading to murder was in 2004 .
Film of a boy making love with a 17 - year - old girl circulated in the Kurdish capital , Arbil .
Two days later she was killed by her family and a week later he was murdered by his .
Since then there has been a sharp increase in the number of women suffering violence – it is almost always the women rather than the men who suffer retribution – as a result of some aspect of their love life being pictured on mobile phones .
In 2007 , at least 350 women , double the figure for the previous year , suffered violence as a result of mobile phone " evidence " , according to Amanj Khalil of the Institute for War and Peace Reporting , citing figures compiled by women 's organisations and the police directorate in Sulaymaniyah .
The true figure is probably much higher .
Bodies are buried in the mountains .
Violence is concealed .
Whole extended families and clans feel a genuine sense of shame because of some supposed act of immorality .
Often retribution is carefully planned .
In the case of Ronak , whose real name has to be concealed , her would - be killer carefully chose his firing point in an empty office building beside the shelter and may have waited for her for a long time .
Ronak , who has three children , came from the ramshackle town of Chamchamal on the road between Sulaymaniyah and Kirkuk .
Accused of adultery by her husband and fearing an honour killing , she fled her house and took refuge first with the police who passed her on in March this year to the Asuda shelter in Sulaymaniyah , one of six shelters in Kurdistan for women who are victims of violence or threatened with honour killing .

She must have thought herself safe .
Along with four other women , she was living on the first floor which can only be reached by a narrow staircase closed off by a locked inner door .
The police gave a measure of protection .
But members of her husband 's family may have pursued her from Chamchamal .
" When we went to court [ with Ronak , who was seeking a divorce ] we thought we were being followed , " says Khanum Raheem Lateef , the manager of Asuda .
The windows in the shelter are mostly masked by curtains , but the one in the kitchen area leading to the bathroom had been taken down .
At 11 pm last Sunday Ronak went to the bathroom and as she came back into the kitchen a gunman lying on a roof 20ft away shot her three times .
The position of women in Iraqi society has deteriorated dramatically since the start of the occupation .
Despite the horrific number of honour killings , their status may be improving only in Kurdistan , where the government is secular , in contrast to Baghdad where the religious parties hold power .
The Kurdish police and courts are also more sympathetic than elsewhere in Iraq to women whose lives have been threatened .
There are no shelters for women in Baghdad or Basra .
Vulnerability to violence is not the only area in which the equal status of women in Iraq has been eroded .
A woman can only get a new passport if she is accompanied by a male relative .
One woman , whose father was too ill to attend the passport office , had to take her 14 - year - old brother with her to vouch for her before officials would give her a new passport .
Many women escape from miserable marriages , often arranged by their families , not by flight but by suicide .
In 2007 , some 600 women and girls in Kurdistan killed themselves , mostly by burning themselves , or by drowning or shooting themselves , according to the Health Ministry of the Kurdistan Regional Government .
" Women may feel there is genuinely no hope for them to escape subjection , " says Sherizaan Minwalla , a lawyer with the Heartland Alliance in Sulaymaniyah , who represents many victims of domestic violence .
" Suicide may seem a rational choice and even a form of protest . "

THE price of oil may soon hit $ 200 a barrel — or so , at any rate , believes Shokri Ghanem , Libya 's oil minister .
A few years ago such a prediction would have seemed absurd .
But the price has doubled in the past year and has risen by 40 % this year alone .
It touched yet another record , of over $ 135 a barrel ( before dipping slightly ) on Thursday 22nd May .
So more spectacular increases seem all too plausible .
The immediate trigger for the latest jump seems to have been an unexpected fall in American oil inventories .
But stocks , although falling , are not particularly low : in America , they are only slightly below the average of the past five years .
Supplies of petrol and other refined fuels are actually a little above average .
And since demand for oil and petrol are falling in America , lower stocks are not as much of a worry as they might normally be .
Mr Ghanem 's explanation for this curious state of affairs is to blame speculators , who are investing ever more enthusiastically in oil futures .
Many others share his view .
Joe Lieberman , an American senator , points out that the value of investment funds that aim to track the price of oil and other raw materials has risen from $ 13 billion to $ 260 billion over the past five years .
He blames these “ index speculators ” , for a big part of the commodity - price increases .
He and his colleagues in the Senate are so worried that they are contemplating measures to curb the traders ' exuberance .
Yet few bankers agree that speculation has much to do with price rises .
For one thing , indexed funds do not actually buy any physical oil , since it is bulky and expensive to store .
Instead they buy contracts for future delivery , a few months hence .
When the delivery date approaches , they sell their contract to someone who actually needs the oil right away , and then invest the proceeds in more futures .
So far from holding oil back from the market , they tend to be big sellers of oil for immediate delivery .
That is important because it means that there is no hoarding , typically a prerequisite for a speculative bubble .
Indeed , as discussed , America 's stocks and those of most other countries are at normal levels .
If the indexed funds were indeed pushing the price of oil beyond the level justified by supply and demand , then they would be having trouble selling their futures contracts at such high prices before they matured .
But there is no sign of that .
In fact , until recently , oil for immediate delivery was more expensive than futures contracts .
Economic theory suggests that the future price is simply traders ' best guess of the shape of things to come .
And traders seem to be very worried about the future .
They recently pushed up the price of oil to be delivered at the end of 2016 to over $ 145 a barrel .
They seem to be motivated by the sobering realities of supply and demand , rather than reckless speculation .
The output of several big oil exporters , such as Russia , Mexico and Venezuela , is declining .
Yet none of those countries allows foreign investors unfettered access to develop new fields or increase production from existing ones .
Many of the most promising areas for exploration , including Saudi Arabia , Iraq and Iran , are in effect off - limits to Western oil firms .
Worse , the cost of developing new fields is rising almost as fast as the oil price .
Cambridge Energy Research Associates , a consulting firm , believes it has more than doubled since 2000 .
All this means that global oil production is growing only slowly .
Global demand , meanwhile , continues to rise , thanks to an ever - increasing thirst for oil in fast - growing developing countries such as China and India .
Their increased consumption is more than compensating for falling demand for oil in rich countries .
In other words , the investors that Messrs Lieberman and Ghanem accuse of unfounded speculation may instead have concluded that the world will be short of oil for some time to come .
Instead of hectoring speculators , perhaps Mr Lieberman should be hounding Mr Ghanem and the leaders of other oil - rich countries to allow foreign oil firms more access .
If , at a trial in a special court , a preponderance of scientific evidence suggested that a vaccine caused one of these problems , a family would be compensated quickly , generously and fairly .
Because no one could sue vaccine makers without going through this special court , the number of lawsuits against vaccine makers fell drastically .
Image Credit ... Gérard DuBois
The system worked fine until a few years ago , when vaccine court judges turned their back on science by dropping preponderance of evidence as a standard .
Now , petitioners need merely propose a biologically plausible mechanism by which a vaccine might cause harm  even if their explanation contradicts published studies .
In 2006 , for example , Dorothy Werderitsh claimed in the vaccine court that a hepatitis B vaccine had triggered an autoimmune response in her brain that led to multiple sclerosis .
Two large studies had clearly shown that hepatitis B vaccine could neither cause nor exacerbate multiple sclerosis , but the court ruled in favor of Ms. Werderitsh , elevating a hypothesis above epidemiological evidence .
The Hannah Poling case is similar .
In 2000 , when Hannah was 19 months old , she received five shots against nine infectious diseases .
Over the next several months , she developed symptoms of autism .
Subsequent tests showed that Hannah has a mitochondrial disorder  her cells are unable to adequately process nutrients  and this contributed to her autism .
An expert who testified in court on the Polings ’ behalf claimed that the five vaccines had stressed Hannah ’s already weakened cells , worsening her disorder .
Without holding a hearing on the matter , the court conceded that the claim was biologically plausible .
On its face , the expert ’s opinion makes no sense .
Even five vaccines at once would not place an unusually high burden on a child ’s immune system .
The Institute of Medicine has found that multiple vaccines do not overwhelm or weaken the immune system .
And although natural infections can worsen symptoms of chronic neurological illnesses in children , vaccines are not known to .
“ There is no evidence that children with mitochondrial enzyme deficiencies are worsened by vaccines , ” Salvatore DiMauro , a professor of neurology at Columbia who is the nation ’s leading expert on the disorder , told me .
Indeed , children like Hannah Poling who are especially susceptible to infections are most likely to benefit from vaccines .
There is a two - word answer to those who think the Olympic torch is a symbol of harmony between nations that should be kept apart from politics – Adolf Hitler .
The ceremony played out on the streets of Paris yesterday did not originate in ancient Greece , nor even in the 19th century , when the Olympic movement was revived .
The entire ritual , with its pagan overtones , was devised by a German named Dr Carl Diem , who ran the 1936 Olympics in Berlin .
Although he was not a Nazi , and was appointed to run the Olympics before the Nazis came to power , Diem adapted very quickly to the new regime , and ended the war as a fanatical military commander exhorting teenage Germans to die like Spartans rather than accept defeat .
Thousands did , but not Diem , who lived to be 80 .

He sold to Josef Goebbels – in charge of media coverage of the Games – the idea that 3,422 young Aryan runners should carry burning torches along the 3,422 km route from the Temple of Hera on Mount Olympus to the stadium in Berlin .
It was his idea that the flame should be lit under the supervision of a High Priestess , using mirrors to concentrate the sun 's rays , and passed from torch to torch along the way , so that when it arrived in the Berlin stadium it would have a quasi - sacred purity .
The concept could hardly fail to appeal to the Nazis , who loved pagan mythology , and saw ancient Greece as an Aryan forerunner of the Third Reich .
The ancient Greeks believed that fire was of divine origin , and kept perpetual flames burning in their temples .
In Olympia , where the ancient games were held , the flame burnt permanently on the altar of the goddess Hestia .
In Athens , athletes used to run relay races carrying burning torches , in honour of certain gods .
But the ancient Games were proclaimed by messengers wearing olive crowns , a symbol of the sacred truce which guaranteed that athletes could travel to and from Olympus safely .
There were no torch relays associated with the ancient Olympics until Hitler .
The route from Olympus to Berlin conveniently passed through Bulgaria , Yugoslavia , Hungary , Austria , and Czechoslovakia - countries where the Nazis wanted to extend their influence .
Before long , all would be under German military occupation .
In Hungary , the flame was serenaded by gypsy musicians who would later be rounded up and sent to death camps .
In Berlin , the flame was carried the last kilometre along Berlin 's main boulevard , by a 26 - year - old runner named Siegfried Eifrig , who was watched by hundreds of thousands as he transferred the flame to a cauldron on an altar surrounded by vast Nazi flags .
Eifrig , amazingly , is still alive , aged 98 , and told the BBC this month that carrying the ceremony should be a purely sporting affair .
Despite its dark political overtones , the event was an unqualified success for the organisers , immortalised in a propaganda film by the Nazi director Leni Riefenstahl .
The ritual has been repeated before each Olympics but not always with such organisational flair .
In Melbourne , in 1956 , the 19 - year - old athlete Ron Clark burnt his hand as he put the torch to the cauldron , because technicians had increased the gas flow , fearing it might not light .
When the Games returned to Australia 44 years later , Clark was persuaded to do the honours again , and burnt his forearm during a rehearsal .
One of the Australians taking part in the 2000 torch ceremony decided to do his stretch in a tractor instead of on foot .
Before yesterday , the flame had gone out just twice .
It was extinguished by a sudden downpour in Montreal in 1976 , when a worker scandalously relit it with a cigarette ligher , forgetting the pagan mystique involved ; it should have been relit from a back - up torch .
In 2004 , it was blown out by a gust of wind .
Yesterday 's events pushed the number of such mishaps from two to five , making the President of the IOC , Jacques Rogge , furious .
" Violence for whatever reason is not compatible with the values of the torch relay or the Olympic Games , " he said .
Someone should have told Adolf Hitler .

One of my favorite passages is the start of chapter 10 , Packages :
In this chapter , we get to start having fun , because we get to start talking about software design .
If we ’re going to talk about good software design , we have to talk about Laziness , Impatience , and Hubris , the basis of good software design .
We ’ve all fallen into the trap of using cut - and - paste when we should have defined a higher - level abstraction , if only just a loop or a subroutine .*
To be sure , some folks have gone to the opposite extreme of defining ever - growing mounds of higher - level abstractions when they should have used cut - and - paste . †
Generally , though , most of us need to think about using more abstraction rather than less .
Caught somewhere in the middle are the people who have a balanced view of how much abstraction is good , but who jump the gun on writing their own abstractions when they should be reusing existing code . ‡ ―――――――――― *
This is a form of False Laziness . †
This is a form of False Hubris . ‡
You guessed it — this is False Impatience .
But if you ’re determined to reinvent the wheel , at least try to invent a better one .
The book is written for programmers , so if you ’ve have n’t programmed before , you should probably start with an easier book .
I ’ve heard “ Learning Perl ” is pretty good .
The Perl Cookbook
By Tom Christiansen and Nathan Torkington
Here is another highly useful book .
If you read the Camel book and thought “ What next ? ” , then this book is the answer .
It ’s got 900 pages of recipes for how to do everything from sorting hashes to writing pre-forking TCP servers .
Each one of the 22 chapters begins with a few pages of very informative discussion of the problem domain at hand .
This book has been extremely useful to me .
It saves you a lot of Googling and looking through various Perl man pages .
I highly recommend it .
Mastering Regular Expressions
By Jeffrey Friedl
While not strictly a Perl book , it is about regular expressions , which were to a large extent popularized by Perl .
Or the other way around .
Or both .
I ’m not sure .
But hey , at least the chapter on Perl is the longest one in the book .
Anyway , the book truly lives up to its title .
It describes in detail how regular expression engines work , how to write effecient expressions , how programming languages support regexes , and more .
Until I read this book , I did not know that there are two main approaches to writing a regular expression engine , a DFA ( deterministic finite automaton ) and an NFA ( nondeterministic finite automaton ) , or that the fastest way to strip leading and trailing whitespace is ( usually ) like so :
s/^\s+// ; s/s+$// ;
I had n’t actually learned Perl before getting this book .
Perl is used in most of the examples in the book , which is what got me interested in the language .
Mastering Algorithms with Perl
By Jon Orwant , Jarkko Hietaniemi , and John Macdonald
I ’m not a computer scientist .
Perhaps that ’s why I found this book so interesting .
It has working Perl code accompanying all the algorithms that are explained in the book , as well as discussions of pertinent CPAN modules .
Though I suspect that last part might be a bit outdated , as the book was written almost a decade ago .
If you know Perl and would like a hands - on introduction to algorithms , this book is great .
Perl Best Practices
By Damian Conway
I liked this book .
I like my code especially clean and readable , and this book has very good guidelines that can help achieve that .
The book is a joy to read ( it has humour ! ) , and it ’s got very useful appendices at the end with quick summaries of all the guidelines .
Then , if you want to audit your source code according to some of these ( and other ) guidelines , you can use the excellent Perl : : Critic module .
Perl Hacks
By chromatic , Damian Conway , and Curtis “ Ovid ” Poe
This one is sort of like The Perl Cookbook , except it focuses more on the process of working with Perl rather than specific solutions to various programmatic problems .
As such , it ’s not really aimed at beginners .
It has many very useful tricks regarding things like customizing your editor for Perl , working with modules , ( ab ) using the guts of Perl , and debugging .
There ’s something in it for everyone .
Higher - Order Perl
By Mark Jason Dominus
Now it ’s getting interesting .
In this book , the author tries to familiarize the reader with ways of programming most common in purely functional languages like Lisp and Haskell .
That makes it very different from most Perl books ( in a good way ) .
The book is all about “ being clever ” as the author has said , so you ’re bound to learn something from it .
I certainly have .
The topics covered include recursion , dispatch tables , currying , and parsing , to name a few .
There are plans to turn the book into wiki , but I I ’m not sure when that ’ll happen .
Perl 6 and Parrot Essentials
By Allison Randal , Dan Sugalski , and Leopold Toetsch
This book is an excellent introduction to Perl 6 and Parrot ( the virtual machine which will run Perl 6 ) , though I ’ve been told that the Parrot bits are a little dated now .
I read it in one sitting , it was that exciting .
I realize that his book is about programming , and that this statement makes me a total geek .
Oh well , there ’s no looking back , Perl 6 will be awesome !
The first half of the book covers the Perl 6 language , while the second covers the design of Parrot .
I did n’t absorb as much as I could have from the second half as I do n’t know much about parsing or compilers , but the first half more than made up for it .
I really wish I could use all those nifty featues in my code right now .
In the meantime , Pugs will have to quence the thirst of those like me who are excited about Perl 6 .
Perl 6 Now
By Scott Walters
I did n’t get much out of this book .
For one , many things are explained which most Perl users already know , so I flipped over many pages while reading it .
Secondly , many of the Perl 6 ideas are illustrated with modules that use source filters , which are known to be unreliable , so you definitely would n’t use them in production code .
Catalyst
By Jonathan Rockway
The chapters in this book follow a very practical approach , diving right in and showing you various common ways of using Catalyst .
I have n’t written much using this fine web framework , so there is n’t really much more I can say about the content of the book .
I can say something about the lack of content though .
This book is missing an overview of Catalyst , and a better explanation of how all the parts fits together .
Some discussion on the MVC architecture and how Catalyst implements it would have been nice as well .
Seeing as the book is quite short , there would be plenty of room for these things .
Perl Medic
By Peter J. Scott
I was not disappointed by this book .
It delivers what is promised .
Having recently started working on an old codebase , I found the book very useful .
Testing , refactoring , benchmarking , debugging ; all these things are well laid out by the author .
It also has a useful chapter on upgrading code written for older versions on Perl , and discusses how to make use of newer features .

Since Hillary Clinton 's campaign has been in damage control after the candidate brought up the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy before the editorial board of a South Dakota newspaper Friday , you 'd think political analysts would be careful when talking about the fallout .
But yesterday , Fox contributor Liz Trotta , a former Washington Times editor and three - time Emmy winner , clearly was n't when Fox host Eric Shawn asked about Clinton 's Kennedy comment .
Instead , she made a distasteful joke ( in the clip above ) .
Trotta :
" And now we have what some are reading as a suggestion that somebody knock off Osama , uh Obama .
Well , both , if we could . "
Shawn : " Talk about how you really feel . "
With an uproar in the blogosphere , Trotta appeared around 9:40 this morning to apologize .
Anchor Bill Hemmer reminded her that people have been criticizing her remarks .
Trotta :
Yes , I am so sorry about what happened yesterday and the lame attempt at humor .
I feel all over myself , making it appear that I wished Barack Obama harm or any other candidate , for that matter , and I sincerely regret it and apologize to anybody I have offended .
It is a very colorful political season , and many of us are making mistakes and saying things we wish we had not said .
Besides joking about the assassination of a senator who 's had to take on a Secret Service detail because of such threats , will analysts continue thinking its really funny to mix up " Osama " and " Obama " through November ?
Anyway , after the jump is Trotta 's apology from Monday 's segment .

Ms Soledad Vela wants laws covering life , health and sexual education
A woman from the governing party in Ecuador has proposed that a woman 's right to enjoy sexual happiness should be enshrined in the country 's law .
Her suggestion has provoked a lively debate in conservative Ecuador .
Maria Soledad Vela , who is helping to rewrite the constitution , says women have traditionally been seen as mere sexual objects or child bearers .
Now , she says , women should have the right to make free , responsible and informed decisions about sex lives .
' Orgasm by law '
Ms Soledad Vela is a member of the governing party on the Constituent Assembly that is rewriting the country 's constitution .
Its aim , among other things , is to ensure a better distribution of wealth and rights for indigenous communities and the poor .
Women , she believes , should not be left off that list .
But her comments have provoked a lively response - mostly , unsurprisingly , from men .
Opposition assembly member , Leonardo Viteri , accused her of trying to decree orgasm by law .
Another called the proposal " ridiculous " and said that such an intimate topic should stay intimate and not be enshrined in law .
Ms Soledad Vela responded to the criticism , saying she had never requested the right to an orgasm - merely the right to enjoy sex in a free , fair and more open society .
She explained that sex was a difficult subject to discuss in Ecuador and that what she wanted were clearer laws covering life , health and sexual education .
" As young Americans you are offered many opportunities for personal development and you are brought up with a sense of generosity , service and fairness , " he said .
" Yet you do not need me to tell you that there are also difficulties : activities and mindsets which stifle hope ; pathways which seem to lead to happiness and fulfilment but in fact end only in confusion and fear . "
As a teenager in Germany , the Pope was forced to join the Hitler Youth but did not take part in it , and his parents opposed the Nazis .
At the end of World War II , he was enrolled in an anti-aircraft unit .
He was briefly taken prisoner by US troops .
" My own years as a teenager were marred by a sinister regime that thought it had all the answers ; its influence grew — infiltrating schools and civic bodies , as well as politics and even religion — before it was fully recognised for the monster it was .
It banished God and thus became impervious to anything true and good , " he said .
He urged the young people to cherish their freedom and appreciate the sacrifices of those who made it possible , but also to beware of falling into the darkness .
" Here , the dreams and longings that young people pursue can so easily be shattered or destroyed .
I am thinking of those affected by drug and substance abuse , homelessness and poverty , racism , violence and degradation — especially of girls and women , " he said .
He said they should not be afraid to speak " the truth about what is good " and to beware of pitfalls behind the guise of freedom .
" How many young people have been offered a hand which , in the name of freedom or experience , has led them to addiction , to moral or intellectual confusion , to hurt , to a loss of self - respect , even to despair and so tragically and sadly to the taking of their own life ? "
Earlier at the concert , the young people were joined by hundreds of seminarians dressed in black cassocks or black suits who jumped and bopped along to the rock and pop performances .
" Words ca n't really do justice to how great this is — so many young people gathered here , " said Chan Lee , who is studying for the priesthood at St John 's Seminary in Los Angeles and came , along with 18 of his fellow students , to see the Pope .
Scott Samford , 20 , drove 15 hours from Georgia , arriving at 3.30 am that day .
" It 's pretty much Christ 's words speaking through the shepherd of the church , " he said , wearing a T - shirt that read , " Hitting One for the Pope 's Team " .
REUTERS
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Iranian boats aggressively approached three U.S. Naval ships in the Strait of Hormuz , a main shipping route for Gulf oil , at the weekend and threatened that the ships would explode , U.S. officials said on Monday .
Iran dismissed U.S. concerns about the incident , saying it was a routine contact .
But the Pentagon termed the Iranian actions “ careless , reckless and potentially hostile ” and said Tehran should provide an explanation .
“ This is a very volatile area and the risk of an incident escalating is real , ” U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said .
“ It is a reminder that there is a very unpredictable government in Tehran . ”
Vice Adm. Kevin Cosgriff , the commander of the U.S. Navy ’s Fifth Fleet , which is based in the Gulf , said five Iranian fast boats moved aggressively toward the U.S. ships in international waters and their actions were “ unduly provocative . ”
“ The ships received a radio call that was threatening in nature , to the effect that they were closing on our ships and ... the U.S. ships would explode , ” Cosgriff told reporters at the Pentagon via videolink from his Bahrain headquarters .
The incident was the latest sign of tension between Washington and Tehran , at odds over a range of issues from Iran ’s nuclear program to U.S. allegations of Iranian support for terrorism and interference in Iraq .
U.S. President George W. Bush is due to travel to the Middle East this week on a trip he has said is partly aimed at countering Iranian influence .
Cosgriff said the U.S. Navy believed the Iranian boats belonged to the country ’s Revolutionary Guard and they were sometimes less than 500 yards ( meters ) from the U.S. ships .
In October , the United States designated the Revolutionary Guard Corps a proliferator of weapons of mass destruction and its elite Qods force a supporter of terrorism .
OIL PRICES ROSE
Oil prices briefly rose on the news about the confrontation as dealers weighed the threat to shipments along the key shipping route .
Crude futures jumped 49 cents to $ 98.40 a barrel before slipping back .
In Tehran , the Iranian Foreign Ministry described the encounter as “ ordinary ” and said it had been resolved .
“ This is an ordinary issue that happens for the two sides every once in a while and , after the identification of the two sides , the issue is resolved , ” Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini told Iran ’s official IRNA news agency .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
An “ informed source ” from the naval force of Iran ’s Revolutionary Guards was quoted by Iranian state television as saying : “ There were no out of the ordinary contacts between the Guards ’ naval force and American ships . ”
The source said three U.S. naval ships were asked by Guards ’ vessels “ as usual ” to identify themselves “ which they did and they continued their path .
Pentagon officials , speaking on condition of anonymity , said after the Iranian threats a U.S. captain was in the process of ordering sailors to open fire when the Iranian boats moved away .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
According to the officials , the radio transmission from one of the Iranian ships said : “ I am coming at you .
You will explode in a couple of minutes . ”
Cosgriff said two Iranian boats also dropped floating white boxes into the water .
He offered no explanation for that move but said the U.S. ships passed the boxes safely .
Cosgriff said the U.S. Navy was very mindful of the damage small craft could do to large ships .
Al Qaeda militants killed 17 U.S. sailors when they rammed an explosives - laden boat into the side of the USS Cole , a destroyer , in Aden in 2000 .
The incident took place about 0400 GMT Sunday , or late Saturday night in Washington , the officials said .
Cosgriff said it was daylight with “ decent visibility . ”
The three U.S. ships were the USS Port Royal , USS Hopper and the USS Ingraham .
Last March , Iran seized 15 British sailors and marines in the Gulf and accused them of trespassing into Iranian waters .
London maintained they were in Iraqi waters but the Britons were held for almost two weeks .
" The basis for optimism is sheer terror . " – Oscar Wilde
This week began in trauma .
It was announced Monday that one of the world 's largest securities firms , Bear Stearns & Co. Inc. , had effectively gone bankrupt .
And that , in a most unusual step , the U.S. Federal Reserve had hastily arranged a forced marriage between Bear Stearns and the larger JP Morgan Chase & Co. , America 's third - largest bank .
Stock markets worldwide plunged in response .
The week ended with traumatized speculation about which illustrious bank or brokerage would be next to go toes up , and whether the Fed , other central bankers worldwide , and cool heads at the financial institutions themselves had the collective wit to stave off a meltdown in the global financial system .
Oh , and the United States appears to be heading into the worst recession in a generation .
There was at least one sanguine voice this week , that of U.S. President George W. Bush .
Against the backdrop of the global credit crisis , a greenback plunging to a new record low against the euro , a housing collapse , a looming bear market for stocks and mounting joblessness , Bush took a brief moment between Florida fundraisers to tell the world that its biggest consumer economy remained " fundamentally sound . "
The same day Bush spoke , Representative Louise Slaughter ( D - NY ) , surveying the layoffs , plant closings and other economic wreckage in her western New York district , had a different take on economic conditions .
She called them " terrifying . "
Most of Bear Stearns ' 14,000 employees will lose their jobs and began early in the week calling recruiters .
Even before the Bear Stearns collapse , the Bank of Canada had warned that the U.S. downturn is likely to inflict considerable damage on Canada .
The latest conventional wisdom has the rest of the world " decoupling " from the U.S. , what with China , India and Europe emerging as rival economic superpowers .
But we 're not nearly there yet .
The effective demise of Bear Stearns sent stocks tumbling on exchanges worldwide , including Toronto , and European stock values fell back to 2005 levels .
U.S. and European employers began warning that their financial outlook for 2008 and even 2009 had turned cloudy , and many large firms announced layoffs to shore up their finances .
The damage would have been far worse save for a residual faith – hope ?
– that the Fed and other central bankers worldwide can prevent more linchpins of the global financial system from coming loose .
And that recent efforts by the Bush administration and the U.S. Congress to assist the jobless and those still facing foreclosure – and the Harper government 's effort last month to assist distressed regions – will prevent a " hard " landing for the economy .
And that bargain - hunters will emerge soon to snap up battered stocks , putting a floor , finally , under sagging prices that are eroding the middle - class nest eggs of mutual - fund owners .
So , how worried should we be ?
Worried enough , at least , to batten the hatches .
Consider :
1. TANKING COMMODITIES WILL HURT CANADA
In his maiden speech last week as governor of the Bank of Canada , Mark Carney was the bearer of bad news .
The high commodity prices for everything from oil to wheat that have largely insulated Canada from the early phases of the U.S. economic slowdown are due for a fall , pulling down Canada 's economic growth rate in 2008 .
By the reckoning of some economists , Canadian GDP growth might clock in at zero this year , which means some economic sectors actually will shrink , resulting in job loss and punishing declines in personal income .
The slide in commodity prices has already begun , with crude oil slipping 4.5 per cent Wednesday , its biggest one - day drop in 17 years , and gold falling below $ 1,000 an ounce the same day in its biggest single - day decline since 2006 .
World currency markets reacted to the blows to the Canadian resource economy by selling off the loonie , which fell below 99 cents ( U.S. ) on Wednesday , its sharpest one - day drop in 47 years .
Demand for Canadian oil and natural gas , base metals , canola and soybeans – all of which have touched record highs of late – will decline as the year progresses .
U.S. demand for our goods will fall , but so will demand from China , India and other developing - world economies .
Determined , finally , to rein in runaway inflation , China is targeting lower growth of 8 per cent this year , compared with 11 per cent in 2007 , which will reduce China 's role in driving up global prices for Canada 's food , fuel and metals .
Chinese exports to the United States , like Canada's , are expected to take a hit from a U.S. slowdown .
" The big fall is coming , " London investment counsellor David Roche of Independent Strategies wrote this week .
In 2007 , as financial and real - estate investments soured , speculators seeking refuge in gold , copper , uranium and other raw materials Canada produces in abundance came to account for more than half of all commodities trading .
But the speculators ' ardour for nickel and soybeans will decline sharply as China finally pulls back on its GDP growth , creating big world surpluses – and price declines – in everything from zinc to cold - rolled steel .
Roche forecasts a 30 per cent price drop in refined oil in 2008 , and a decline of 20 per cent to 30 per cent for base metals .
Lest anyone think of this as a strictly Western Canadian setback , note that the Western oil patch in good years spends tens of millions of dollars annually on extraction equipment made in Ontario and Quebec .
2. BANK PARALYSIS DRIES UP CREDIT .
The global financial system is in the sick bay .
And there 's no confident prognosis of when recovery can be expected .
Many global lenders ' capital bases are in danger – the factor that caused Bear Stearns ' collapse .
Since January of last year , the world 's largest banks and brokerages have suffered a collective loss of $ 181 billion ( U.S. ) on loan losses and reserves set aside for bad loans .
Those losses have so severely depleted the treasuries of Citigroup Inc. , Merrill Lynch Inc. and Swiss banking giant UBS AG , the largest bank in Europe , that all three have secured Red Cross injections of capital from state - owned investment funds and other investors in the Middle East and Asia .
The capital shortage at financial institutions has been worsened by the moribund condition of the markets for takeovers and initial public offerings ( IPOs ) , depriving the banks and brokers of lucrative fees just when they need them .
Then again , overpriced , highly leveraged takeovers made at the height of acquisition exuberance in 2005 to 2007 are yet another source of the banks ' current woes .
Worldwide , banks , brokerages , hedge funds and even municipal pension - fund plans are on the hook for more than $ 1 trillion ( U.S. ) worth of buyout debt .
This is debt that private equity deal makers piled onto Chrysler LLC 's balance sheet , and intend to burden Ma Bell parent BCE Inc. with so that those takeover targets can be made to pay the cost of their own acquisition .
Three New York - based banks and brokers alone , including Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. ( the subject of bankruptcy rumours this week ) , are saddled with more than $ 300 billion ( U.S. ) in private equity debt .
Contemplating such losses from at least some of the takeovers they financed , along with the near certainty of a wave of consumer - credit defaults on car , credit - card and other borrowing as the U.S. recession deepens , bankers are especially tight with money these days .
That would be the case even if they were n't girding for further losses from the bursting of the $ 8 trillion ( U.S. ) housing bubble .
That 's why banks worldwide have been hoarding cash by raising their lending rates – both to dissuade borrowers and to strengthen their balance sheets with higher rates imposed on their most creditworthy customers – even as the U.S.
Fed slashed rates by 0.75 percentage points this week in still another bid to stimulate the economy .
If the bankers and the Fed appear to be acting at cross-purposes , so be it :
The banks are being extra cautious for fear of being next on the list of lenders forcibly merged out of existence .
The resulting capital drought is yet another drag on an already anemic U.S. economy .
3. LOSS OF TRUST
As of March 13 , Bear Stearns was telling anyone who asked that it was in fine shape .
Next day , it told Washington it was on death 's door .
Northern Rock PLC , Britain 's largest mortgage lender and the first government - bailout casualty , was similarly sanguine about its prospects until a sudden bank run brought it to its knees .
As of late last year , Fed chair Ben Bernanke was insisting the crisis in subprime - mortgage defaults would not migrate into the larger U.S. economy , much less the global one .
Before he became a big investor in Wells Fargo & Co. , the biggest bank on the U.S. West Coast , Warren Buffett counselled investors against banks .
They can too easily hide their problems , he warned .
Bankers know that better than anyone , which is why they exhibited more than the usual suspicion this week in lending to each other – an essential function of modern global banking that keeps the system liquid .
Interbank loans are cut off – as happened to Bear Stearns March 13 – when fellow banks and brokers abruptly cease lending to a peer they fear will not be good for the money .
The bankers and the Fed and other U.S. financial regulators have themselves to blame for the trust deficit that has grown since the credit crisis began seven months ago .
That 's when Bear Stearns found it could not recapitalize two of its hedge funds stuffed with " subprime " mortgages , the toxic instruments at the heart of the global credit crisis .
Earlier this decade , millions of low - income Americans , often making no down payment and offering no collateral , were induced to buy homes they could n't afford , lured by low , " teaser " rates that currently are " resetting " at often usurious levels .
The premise was that home prices nationwide had never fallen , and that people who took out these junk or " wishful thinking " mortgages , as New York Times financial columnist David Leonhardt has called them , would be able to renegotiate their mortgages later at more favourable rates .

All the additional home - buying did ignite a boom in U.S. home prices , but this classic South Sea bubble burst last year , with prices falling between 30 per cent and 50 per cent .
With the regulators ' after - the - fact approval , the world financial system was tricked up with a proliferation of devices for disguising " bundles " of subprime mortgages and other junk .
These convoluted " innovations " included " structured investment vehicles " ( SIVs ) , " collateralized debt obligations " ( CDOs ) and " asset - backed commercial paper " ( ABCP ) , stuff that bank CEOs did n't understand or even know were in the bank 's portfolio .
In a game of hot potato , banks unloaded this junk far and wide in bundles stamped with triple - A creditworthiness stickers , the recipients raking off their fees only to flip the package again until a $ 475,000 split - level in suburban Toledo whose low - income subprime mortgagee could no longer make the payments had found its way into the portfolio of a municipal employees pension plan in Hamburg or , remarkably , enough , an agency of the Ontario Treasurer .
About two years ago , Ed Clark , CEO of Toronto Dominion Bank , stumbled across an operation within his bank engaged in trading this unfamiliar exotica .
On discovering that the junior - ranking staff playing with the new toys could not explain how they worked , Clark demanded the stuff be immediately dumped ( near the top of the market , as good luck would have it ) .
The Bear Stearns debacle and its aftershocks " stems from a loss of trust in the whole system of modern finance , with all its complex slicing and dicing or risk into ever more opaque forms , " veteran financial markets columnist Gillian Tett wrote this week in the U.K. Financial Times .
" This trend is not just damaging the credibility of banks , but the aura of omnipotence that has enveloped institutions such as the U.S. Federal Reserve in recent years . "
4. CORPORATE EXPANSION STALLS .
As long as the credit crunch persists , consumer and corporate borrowing will be constrained .
Which means a longer - than - usual wait for that car loan and the small - business start - up loan .
Also jeopardized are routine lines of credit by which enterprises simply keep the lights on , along with more substantial loans for corporate expansion that creates jobs , new product lines and new geographic markets .
Corporate strategies are on hold across North America .
Western Canadian pipeline projects await financing , and branch - plant operations as varied as Home Depot Inc. and Sears Canada have Canadian expansion plans on hold .
Consumer - products giant Procter & Gamble Co. can't jettison its pet food business or Braun small - appliances unit for lack of credible buyers .
Venerable enterprises like apparel retailer Talbots Inc. and struggling newcomers such as Internet phone provider Vonage Holdings Corp. are equally stymied in obtaining credit .
" Getting the financing done , whether on our side or the other , is impossible , " Gary Rodkin , chief executive of U.S. consumer food giant ConAgra Foods Inc. , told the Wall Street Journal this week .
" It 's crystal clear : Financing is almost nonexistent . "
5. U.S. CONSUMER FATIGUE .
As a U.S. recession deepens , its effects will be felt ever more widely in Canada .
In slower sales of the minivans that roll off Chrysler 's immense plant in Windsor , for instance – almost all destined for the U.S. market .
Or at Waterloo's Research In Motion Ltd. if Wall Street steps up its tradition during slumps of laying off tens of thousands of white - collar BlackBerry addicts .
The entire B.C. economy is reliant on timber sales to a barely breathing U.S. new - house market .
It 's said that the burgeoning middle class in China and India are developing a taste for North American goods .
And it 's true that Buicks that can't be given away in North America have lately become status symbols in Shanghai and Nanjing .
For all that , though , China boasts a consumer economy of about $ 1 trillion and India of a mere $ 600 million .
In the U.S. , where shopping is famously referred to as " retail therapy , " the consumer economy rings up about $ 9 trillion in annual sales .
Without robust American spending on Canadian goods , including patronage of our huge tourism sector , many Canadians will feel the pain .
Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney was right , up to a point , that Canada benefits from " strength in domestic demand .
We have a number of very strong fundamentals – corporate balance sheets , bank balance sheets , household balance sheets . "
But our GDP is more export - oriented than most G - 7 countries , and the bulk of those exports still head south .
This is going to be , to say the least , a challenging next two years for Canadian exporters and for Canadian firms like TD Bank , Manulife Financial Inc. , Tim Hortons Inc. and Alimentation Couche - Tard Ltée. , which have aggressive growth plans in the U.S. in banking , insurance , fast food and convenience - store retailing , respectively .
They 'll be on the front lines as Americans cope with spending within their means .
CEO Howard Schwartz , as if he did n't have enough of a challenge in attempting a turnaround at struggling Starbucks Corp. , told shareholders Wednesday at the coffee chain 's annual meeting that , " You have an economy that really is in a tailspin , and many would say the consumer is in a recession .
We 're dealing with things we have n't seen before in terms of how people are responding to how tough it is . "
With so many U.S. financiers " staring into the jaws of hell , " as one New York analyst put it last week , a best - case scenario can't be ruled out .
Lenders are newly cautious .
There 's still a lot of restless money out there in Asian and Middle Eastern " sovereign wealth funds " and traditional North American and European asset - management funds .
If worst comes to worst , the United States may end up creating a state agency to relieve troubled lenders of their junk – which the Fed effectively began to do by accepting a liberal definition of collateral in return for emergency bank financing .
It would be a costly gambit , reminiscent of Resolution Trust Corp. , which picked up the pieces after the U.S. savings and loan disaster of the 1980s , whose total cost , while enormous by contemporary standards , would seem like chicken feed compared to this catastrophe .
Better that , though , than a great unwinding of the global financial system – although there 's room to wonder if America , facing a $ 3 trillion debt in Iraq and Afghanistan , can resort to a rescue for the ages without resorting to printing the currency to fund it .

Bob Josserand is bullish on bullshit .
It 's sexy , he says .
As mayor of Hereford , Josserand should know .
He lords over a town of some 16,000 people and more than 1 million cattle .
Three and a half million chew their cuds within a 100 - mile radius of his Panhandle home .
" A million head of cattle produces a lot of manure over a day , " he says .
Josserand 's AzTx Cattle Co. owns five feedlots with a capacity of 232,000 head in Texas , Colorado and Kansas .
He pays anywhere from $ 150,000 to $ 200,000 a year to haul manure from his Hereford lot .
Named for the early herds of Hereford cattle , Hereford is often called the town without a toothache on account of its low incidence of tooth decay , the gift of high levels of natural fluoride in the municipal water supply .
More often , Hereford is called the " Beef Capital of the World . "
Yet corn is why Josserand is so bullish .
In September , he kicked off the groundbreaking celebration for Dallas - based Panda Energy International 's $ 186 million ethanol plant , which will churn out 105 million gallons of the alcohol fuel annually once it 's fired up in late 2007 .
The refinery will be powered not by natural gas , as is common for these plants , but by cattle manure — some 70 tons per hour and more than 1 billion pounds per year .
Refined from corn , ethanol is the hot new energy elixir .
It enhances America 's energy security by reducing reliance on imported oil .
It reduces emissions and helps lower greenhouse gas accumulation .
Thus , the Energy Policy Act of 2005 mandates that 7.5 billion gallons of renewable fuels such as ethanol be sluiced into the nation 's gasoline supply by 2012 , nearly double the 3.9 billion gallons produced in the United States last year .
President Bush says he likes the idea of promoting a fuel that relies on farmers .
Investors are throwing cash at it .
Enter Panda .
Panda Chief Executive Officer Todd Carter likes to call Hereford the Saudi Arabia of manure , and his ethanol plant is the first known project on the globe to use the stuff to fuel an ethanol refinery .
Josserand calls
Hereford home to the sexiest environmental project in the world , one that will also produce cattle feed as a byproduct .
" We 're going to take a product that comes out of an ethanol plant called distiller 's grain , and we 're going to put it back in the mouth of that animal so that it can come out in the back , " he says , explaining this revolutionary ecosystem .
Energy executives and Texas leaders such as state Senator Kel Seliger and Kathleen White , chair of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality , filled the Panda shindig , which included a hoedown with music from country swing band Asleep at the Wheel and complimentary steak , beer and wine the night before .
A producer for Geraldo At Large was stalking the refinery site prepping for a segment on the plant .
( It ran September 22 on the Fox network . )
This just may be the biggest thing Hereford has ever seen .
Still , Hereford resident Jeff
See did n't have an invitation to the Panda celebration .
He snuck into the hoedown , but his stealthy showing is n't a surprise , because while Panda is launching its " poop - to - pump " ethanol plant in a media glare , three miles away See is quietly overseeing the construction of a 100 million - gallon , $ 119 million ethanol plant for Dallas - based White Energy .
In fact , Dallas energy firms are gambling big on ethanol and other renewable fuels such as soy and waste grease - based biodiesel all over the country , and it's not a bad gamble either , what with high oil prices and taxpayer subsidies and government mandates all but guaranteeing returns .
But are renewable fuels all they 're cracked up to be ?
Maybe not .
While they cut down on pollutants such as carbon monoxide , critics charge that ethanol as currently deployed in the nation 's fuel supply actually boosts ozone - forming emissions such as hydrocarbons .
Then there 's the corn itself , a crop that requires intensive amounts of water , fertilizer , pesticides and transport , thus using plenty of fossil fuels in cultivation .
While a few studies show that corn - based ethanol does n't yield as much energy as it consumes to produce it , many more show that ethanol yields about 27 percent more energy than it takes to produce , though much of that comes not from burning the fuel itself but from adding in the value of the cattle feed the ethanol production process generates .
Plus , ethanol does n't pack as much energy as gasoline , so vehicles running on fuels high in ethanol suffer a 30 percent loss in fuel mileage .
But none of this may matter .
" Politically , the ethanol program seems to be bulletproof , " says Jerry Taylor , senior fellow at the Cato Institute , a Washington - based libertarian think tank .
" The real purpose of ethanol is to fatten farmers ' paychecks before elections . "
Though he might not admit it , Kevin Kuykendall is in a race .
As CEO of White Energy , he 's essentially locking horns with Panda Energy to see who can complete Texas ' first ethanol plant , and both companies are nothing if not ambitious .
Panda , founded in 1982 as a builder of power generation plants , including one in China and a hydroelectric project in Nepal , just got the green light from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment to begin construction on a natural - gas - fueled , 100 million - gallon - per - year ethanol plant in Yuma , Colorado .
That 's in addition to the Hereford project and two additional manure - fueled , 100 million - gallon plants slated for Sherman and Haskell County , Kansas .
" You really almost can't build them fast enough , " says Kuykendall , who 's shooting to be one of the biggest — if not the biggest — ethanol players in Texas .
Over the next few years , Kuykendall hopes
White will grow to produce 500 million to 700 million gallons of ethanol annually with plants throughout Texas and along the East Coast .
A relief pitcher for the Cleveland Indians in the 1980s before he was benched by an injury , Kuykendall is a highly polished executive with a meticulously groomed beard — an unlikely candidate to hobnob with farmers and ranchers .
But he has charm where it counts : on Wall Street and with capital markets .
He sits in his spacious , ultra - modern office perched on the top floor of Two Galleria Tower explaining how over the last few months his company has raised nearly $ 500 million to develop a series of renewable fuel plants .
Already operating a 45 million - gallon - per - year plant in Russell , Kansas , and with construction under way in Hereford , White plans to build or acquire three to five ethanol plants and two to three biodiesel plants over the next three years .
His company is in the midst of buying another undisclosed 100 million - gallon facility in Texas .
For Kuykendall , who moved to Dallas from Maryland , where he ran a telecommunications company , Dallas is an ideal location to build an ethanol empire , and he and Panda 's Todd Carter are n't the only ones plunging into the market .
Americas Strategic Alliances , a Dallas - based merchant banking and investment firm , announced last month that its ASAlliances Biofuels Inc. arm filed for a $ 300 million initial public stock offering with plans to build three 100 million - gallon ethanol plants in Linden , Indiana ; Albion , Nebraska ; and Bloomingburg , Ohio .
All three plants are scheduled for completion in 2007 , right around the time the White and Panda plants go on line ( ASAlliances Biofuels executives declined to comment for this story ) .
Kuykendall eschews the Midwest .
Though it is where most of the nation 's corn is grown , he says the Midwestern ethanol capacity is overbuilt .
Putting ethanol plants in Texas makes more sense , since the state is the second - largest gasoline market after California .
Locating capacity close to the Texas demand , currently estimated at 500 million to 700 million gallons of ethanol per year , is far more efficient because corn is cheaper to handle and ship than ethanol .
" There 's also a lot of venture people here that make good money in oil , " Kuykendall says .
" So they 're looking at ' How do I redistribute the profits that I made into the next big thing ? '
And renewables is big right now . "
White 's
Hereford plant is being built adjacent to a 9.5 million - bushel grain elevator and 2.5 - mile rail loop owned and operated by Decatur , Illinois - based Archer Daniels Midland Company ( ADM ) , the nation 's largest corn processor and ethanol producer .
White will use ADM 's elevator and rail line for its plant .
And White 's plant , fueled by natural gas , is much further along in construction than Panda 's manure - fueled plant , which accelerates the breakdown of manure into fuel gases such as methane by baking it .
Jeff See , White Energy 's vice president of construction and development , has been building these plants all over the country for nearly a quarter - century , cutting his teeth on corn-syrup - processing facilities .
He says he built the nation 's first two 100 million - gallon ethanol plants in South Dakota and Fort Dodge , Iowa .
" When I first started , it took more energy to make it than you got out of it , " says See , who shouts over the blaring horns of locomotives that pull long trains — some 65 daily — just a few yards from his construction office trailer .
In 1994 , he says , his plants were squeezing 2.3 gallons of ethanol per bushel of corn ( 56 pounds of corn kernels ) .
His new White plant will get 2.8 gallons per bushel thanks mainly to advancements in enzyme and fermentation technologies .
He hopes to coax 3 gallons in a couple of years .
To get ethanol from corn , the starches in the kernels must be converted to sugar .
Yeasts are added to eat the sugar , and they create carbon dioxide and alcohol as waste products .
" It 's just like making beer , " See says .
" We actually have a tank called a beer well . "
Corn kernels are first ground into flour , which is mixed with water to form a mash .
Enzymes are added to the mash to convert the starch to dextrose , a simple sugar .
See pulls labeled samples of corn mixture from each stage of the refining process .
Some of them have fluffy tufts of mold .
To control bacteria levels , the mash is processed in a high - temperature cooker before it 's cooled and transferred to fermenters , where yeast is added to convert sugars into ethanol and carbon dioxide .
The slurry is then transferred to distillation columns where the ethanol and water are separated — an energy - intensive process — and the alcohol is further dehydrated to roughly 200 proof .
Distiller 's grain , the leftover solids , is dried and sold as a livestock feed .
Ranchers buy it for less than the cost of corn , but it has all the nutritional value of corn plus some moisture .
More important , it does n't have the starch , which can't be digested by cattle .
" Corn 's already coming here , " See says .
" So the way ethanol producers see it , they 're just processing the corn into a more nutritious , more easily digestible cattle feed .
Ethanol is almost a bonus . "
But with so many new plants coming on line across the nation , will there be a cattle feed glut ?
" At some point we 're going to saturate the distiller 's grain market , " warns Nathanael Greene , biofuels expert for the National Resources Defense Council .
" Then there wo n't be this energy credit . "
Ethanol is n't the only renewable game played in Dallas .
Biodiesel is hauling in capital too .
In October 2005 , Dallas - based Earth Biofuels became the first publicly traded biodiesel company selling shares on the NASDAQ stock exchange .
" Texas is one of the best states for producing and selling biodiesel , " says Rob Reed of Earth Biofuels .
According to the National Biodiesel Board , Texas ranks second nationally in biodiesel production capacity ( 98.75 million gallons annually ) behind Iowa .
More than 75 million gallons of biodiesel were produced last year in the United States , and production is expected to more than double this year .
Refined from everything from soybeans , canola and palm oils , waste restaurant grease , and chicken fat and beef tallow , biodiesel is perhaps the sexiest fuel pumping into tanks , at least when measured by the cabal of celebrity mouthpieces Earth Biofuels has assembled .
Earlier this year , the company unfurled a potent marketing campaign featuring Oscar - winning actor Morgan Freeman , one - time NASCAR champion Rusty Wallace , actress Julia Roberts and country music singer Willie Nelson .
Nelson has even slapped his image on B20 biodiesel fuel pumps ( a blend of 20 percent biodiesel and 80 percent petroleum diesel ) sold under the BioWillie moniker , which Earth Biofuels markets and distributes exclusively .
The company plans to pump the fuel as well as ethanol at its retail outlets nationwide through its newly formed American Earth Fuels Co. subsidiary .
Formed in 2004 as a Jackson , Mississippi - based refiner of waste restaurant grease , Earth Biofuels was acquired in 2005 by Apollo Resources International , a Dallas - based company specializing in natural gas and liquid natural gas production .
It has since opened a 10 million - gallon - per - year biodiesel refinery in Durant , Oklahoma , and has invested in a 65 million - gallon - per - year ethanol refinery near New Orleans with plans to invest in another ethanol refinery in North Carolina through its subsidiary Earth Ethanol Inc .
But for now , the company 's thrust is biodiesel .
" Biodiesel makes sense , " says Sterling Burnett , senior fellow for the National Center for Policy Analysis , a Dallas - based think tank .
" It 's not as expensive to distill [ as ethanol ] , and it gives you more energy per unit of energy [ consumed ] .
There 's a debate as to whether you get more energy out of ethanol than it takes to produce it . "
Burnett says gasoline yields 83 percent more energy than is invested for its production .
But Dr. Dick Auld , chairman of the department of plant and soil sciences at Texas Tech University in Lubbock , is skeptical of such life cycle energy calculus .
" If you did an energy budget on petroleum like [ was done for ethanol ] , it'd be disastrous , " he says .
" Because you 're looking at all of the steel pipes , the oil well and the trucks that take it out there . "
According to a University of Minnesota study published last summer , soy - based biodiesel generates 93 percent more energy than it takes to produce and releases fewer air pollutants per net energy gain than ethanol , making it a substantially cleaner fuel than petroleum diesel .
But like ethanol , biodiesel has drawbacks , primarily high production costs .
Biodiesel costs roughly $ 1 more per gallon than petroleum diesel , and blends such as B20 can cost 10 to 25 cents more per gallon .
To be competitive with petroleum , biodiesel must be heavily subsidized : a $ 1 - per - gallon blending subsidy ( 50 cents for recycled restaurant grease ) larded over with various state and local tax incentives .
" We have to face facts , " Reed says .
" If we want to optimize for cost , what makes sense is to just burn all of the fossil fuels we have .
We 've got plenty of them ...
It 's a total myth that we 're running out of any of the fossil fuels .
The question is do we want to do that ?
If we did n't care about the carbon issue , we would n't really have an energy problem . "
But biodiesel may have an environmental issue of its own : land .
While an acre of corn can produce roughly 300 to 450 gallons of ethanol , an acre of soybeans can produce only an estimated 50 to 60 gallons of biodiesel .
Attempting to replace a significant portion of U.S. petroleum diesel consumption with soy - based biofuels could potentially put huge swaths of acreage under the plow , enveloping both forests and wetlands .
( The primary biodiesel base in the United States is soy oil while in Europe it is rapeseed oil , and Asia utilizes palm and palm kernel oil . )
At optimum production levels , neither ethanol nor biodiesel can come close to making a significant dent in our annual consumption of 140 billion gallons of gasoline and 46.6 billion gallons of diesel fuel .
According to the Minnesota study , full - throttle U.S. biofuels production can replace only a small fraction of U.S. motor fuel demand : 12 percent of gasoline and 6 percent of diesel , even with dedicating all U.S. corn and soybean production to fuel .
" Biofuels are not going to be the clichéd silver bullet , " Reed says .
What biofuels might be is the clichéd pork barrel — a political hog gussied up in subsidies , mandates and rule - bending all draped in earth - friendly green .
The cover story in the October issue of Consumer Reports , " Special Report , The Ethanol Myth , " seemed to confirm this .
Consumer Reports ' analysts put a 2007 Chevrolet
Tahoe flexible fuel vehicle — a vehicle that can burn gasoline or a blend of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline dubbed E85 — through its paces , testing fuel economy , acceleration and emissions .
Flex vehicles , it turns out , are sweet for U.S. automakers .
They 've manufactured more than 5 million of them since the late 1990s ( 6 million flex vehicles are currently rolling on U.S. roads , according to the National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition ) .
The reason ?
Automakers collect fuel economy credits good toward calculating federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy ( CAFE ) fleet standards ( 27.5 mpg for cars , 21.6 mpg for light trucks ) .
The flex fuel trucks are awarded a higher mileage rating so the automakers do n't get penalized for heavily weighing their light truck fleet with large SUVs — the theory being that putting more ethanol vehicles on the road will be a good thing vis -à - vis oil consumption and the environment .
( Automakers are penalized if the average fuel economy of vehicles they sell dips below the federal standards . )
These credits roughly translate into a fuel economy rating 1 2/3 times the actual gasoline rating — a calculation based on the assumption a flex vehicle will run gasoline half the time with the remaining half run on E85 .
So , as Consumer Reports notes , a conventional Tahoe rated at 21 mpg is rated at 35 mpg for the flex vehicle , even though the vast majority of these vehicles will never burn a drop of E85 .
Essentially , automakers can manufacture a surplus of guzzling , high - profit SUVs and market them as fuel sippers .
Consumer Reports ' findings were sobering .
They discovered that while a vehicle fueled by E85 created fewer emissions than one running gasoline , it suffered dramatic losses in fuel economy : from 21 to 15 miles per gallon on the highway and from 9 to 7 miles per gallon in the city .
The Tahoe 's range dropped from 440 miles per tank of gasoline to 300 miles for E85 .
While the flex fuel vehicle running on E85 did n't suffer significant losses in acceleration , it was more costly to operate because of the mileage losses .
Consumer Reports calculated that the average August 2006 E85 pump price of $ 2.91 per gallon translated to $ 3.99 when compensating for the mileage loss — if you can find E85 , that is .
At the time of the report there were just 800 out of 176,000 gas stations nationwide selling the fuel ( the National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition reports that number now exceeds 1,000 ) with most located in the upper Midwest close to where corn is grown and most ethanol is refined .
According to the Renewable Fuels Association , there are 106 ethanol refineries with a total production capacity of 5.1 billion gallons , with another 45 plants and 3.5 billion gallons of capacity under construction .
Plants like those being built by Panda Energy and White Energy could dramatically change the availability , but probably not the cost .
Simply put , ethanol is an expensive fuel to produce and distribute .
To offset these costs , taxpayers kick in a 51 - cent - per - gallon tax credit that , along with various state tax incentive programs , runs up a national tab of more than $ 2 billion per year , according to The Wall Street Journal .
That 's on top of the $ 3.6 billion per year taxpayers cough up to subsidize corn growers , who in 2005 unloaded 14.4 percent of their crop to ethanol refiners .
But White Energy 's Kuykendall insists that corn-farming subsidies are meaningless to the ethanol equation .
" The farmer is getting the subsidies whether he sells his corn to an ethanol plant or he sells his corn to somebody who 's making food with it , " he says .
" So I think that 's an irrelevant discussion .
It has nothing to do with the ethanol industry ... From our perspective , if you can produce something here in the U.S. that eliminates a need for foreign oil ... it is an advantage to the U.S. "
But there are other costs .
Last June ,
The Wall Street Journal reported the ethanol boom was exerting upward pressure on corn prices , adding costs to everything from foods flavored with corn sweeteners to cattle , hogs and chickens fattened with corn feed .
Then there are the logistical challenges .
It can cost gas stations up to $ 200,000 to install pumps and tanks to handle E85 , though that is somewhat offset by a 30 percent tax credit up to $ 30,000 tucked in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 .
And because of its corrosiveness and affinity to water , ethanol can't be shipped through existing fuel pipelines to terminals .
It must be shipped via rail , barge or truck and stored in separate tanks before it is " splash " blended directly into gasoline trucks , generally in a mix of 90 percent gasoline and 10 percent ethanol , or E10 .
Such logistical challenges caused severe supply disruptions earlier this year when there was a switch in gasoline " oxygenates , " fuel additives that reduce carbon monoxide emissions .
For years Congress has required the use of oxygenates such as ethanol and methyl tert - butyl ether ( MTBE ) — a substance blended into gasoline at low levels since 1979 as an octane booster to replace tetra - ethyl lead .
But since 1992 , MTBE has been sloshed into gasoline in higher concentrations in some areas to economically fulfill mandated oxygenate requirements .
Being in the thick of the Corn Belt , the Midwest has long relied on ethanol to fulfill this role , but because ethanol is expensive to handle and ship , areas such as the East Coast and Texas relied on MTBE , as it can be easily blended into gasoline and shipped through existing pipelines .
Then in 1995 , traces of MTBE were discovered in tens of thousands of water wells across the country .
Though MTBE is not classified as an environmental hazard or a human carcinogen and its health risks are debatable , it ruins the taste of water in low concentrations .
As part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 , Congress imposed a huge new ethanol mandate while denying liability protection for MTBE producers ; hence most oil companies abandoned the additive last May .
The switch squeezed ethanol producers dry , and fuel terminal operators scrambled to meet the mandate for summer blends , especially in places like Dallas and Houston , sending ethanol prices far beyond the cost of the MTBE additive it replaced .
According to the Houston Chronicle , July ethanol futures were selling for $ 3.73 per gallon in June compared with $ 1.99 for MTBE , though ethanol prices have subsided considerably since then , trading at $ 1.89 for November futures as of this writing .
" When you 're talking about these things , lay out the benefits , but lay out the costs as well , " says the National Center for Policy Analysis ' Sterling Burnett .
" Not too many people know about the costs related to these clean fuels , these renewable fuels .
You can't justify them on economic grounds , and I do n't think you can justify them on environmental grounds ... It 's just a pure boondoggle . "
The environmental attraction of biofuels is " carbon neutrality , " meaning the carbon dioxide they add to atmosphere when burned is roughly equal to what the crops have absorbed through respiration .
Thus , in theory , they do n't add to greenhouse gas accumulation .
Still , there are environmental costs , which reared their dirty heads during the unsuccessful re-election campaign of the first President Bush .
In 1991 , President George H.W.
Bush proposed new clean air rules that slapped strict caps on fuel volatility , a measure designed to combat air quality problems in some of the nation 's smoggiest cities .
There was one problem : Ethanol did n't meet the cap .
The new regulation would have barred ethanol splash - blended gasoline because the oxygen - rich fuel , though cleaner burning , evaporates more rapidly than gasoline , releasing more hydrocarbons , which cook in the atmosphere to form ozone .
A year later , as the presidential election loomed , Bush found himself sagging in the polls .
" But now , seeking to woo farm voters in Illinois and other Midwestern states crucial to his re-election , Bush has ordered his staff to find a way to rewrite the regulation , reversing its effect so it would promote higher sales of the corn- derived fuel instead , " reported the Chicago Tribune on September 9 , 1992 .
Fat ethanol refiner profits were at stake .
Archer Daniels Midland Co. , whose then Chairman Dwayne Andreas flushed the Republican war chest with more than $ 1 million , stood to earn at least $ 125 million in additional annual profits per year if the rule was amended to permit unrestricted ethanol - gasoline blends .
In early October , Bush vowed to rewrite environmental rules to provide for an ethanol exemption , essentially " passing out an election - year goodie intended to shore up support in Illinois and other Midwestern farm states , " the Tribune said .
Granted , these air quality problems are almost nonexistent in fuels with high ethanol concentrations , such as with E85 .
But evaporative emissions peak at about 10 percent ethanol and 90 percent gasoline , the very ethanol fuel most in use .
" The irony is painful , " says the National Resources Defense Council 's Nathanael Greene .
But that is n't the only adverse ethanol impact .
In April 2002 , the Environmental Protection Agency declared most ethanol plants were in violation of federal clean air rules , emitting unlawful amounts of carbon monoxide .
That same year , 12 ethanol plants entered into a settlement with the Department of Justice , the state of Minnesota and the EPA over clean - air violations , and the Sierra Club sued two Midwestern plants for releasing potentially carcinogenic volatile organic compounds .
In October of this year , The Associated Press reported that the Iowa Environmental Council and the Iowa Department of Natural Resources are concerned about the soil erosion large - scale corn cultivation causes and laments that ethanol plants are fairly large emitters of contaminants .
" It 's not environmentally friendly at all , " says Kevin Hassett , director of economic policies for the American Enterprise Institute , a Washington , D.C. - based public policy think tank .
" So you 're left wondering : Why have all of these subsidies ?
The answer is not because of the characteristics of ethanol ; rather it 's because of the characteristics of the senators who decide to [ promote it ] . "
Despite the environmental , economic and practical challenges corn- based ethanol poses , many environmental organizations embrace the fuel .
Ethanol and other renewables , they say , are integral to strategies designed to slash gasoline and diesel fuel consumption .
" We need to use corn ethanol as a foundation , as a building block to get to where we want to go , " says the defense council 's Greene .
" So we want to see it done as smart and as clean as possible , and we think it can get a heck of a lot smarter and cleaner than it is done today ... But we can't wait . "
Because corn - based ethanol does provide benefits , even if marginal , we need to start using it to reshuffle our transportation fuels portfolio in a way that is easier on the national economy and environment and does n't exacerbate security risks , Greene insists .
He sees corn -based ethanol as a starting point to more efficient and less land - and fossil - fuel - intensive cellulosic ethanol , or fuel derived from switchgrass and agricultural wastes such as cornstalks , rice hulls and wood chips .
Though the process to convert cellulose into sugars and then fuel is barely in nascent stages , proponents see it as the most potent punch to finally put a sizable dent in U.S. oil consumption .
And the potential is stunning .
While corn -based ethanol can yield 300 to 450 gallons per acre and soy generates just 50 to 60 gallons of fuel per acre , ethanol from switchgrass can potentially yield 1,000 gallons per acre or more , Greene says .
" Once you crack that code , then you can talk about an industry not producing 5 billion gallons a year but producing 50 billion gallons a year , " says Matt Hartwig of the Renewable Fuels Association , an organization that promotes both corn and cellulosic ethanol .
" It really blows the lid off the industry . "
Hence the current Bush administration is throwing money — some $ 150 million tucked in the 2007 budget — at the technology to help fund the bio-refineries that will produce the fuel .
The Energy Policy
Act of 2005 mandates that 250 million gallons of cellulosic ethanol be added to the nation 's fuel supplies by 2013 and provides for loan guarantees for cellulosic refineries .
But the challenges are daunting .
The process requires massive research investment to discover and produce efficient enzymes that can break plant cellulose into sugar and organisms that will convert those sugars into ethanol .
The enzymes are expensive , and the process is risky .
Progress depends on oil prices hovering above $ 50 per barrel .
" Cellulosic ethanol has never been manufactured on an industrial scale , and the technology to produce this type of ethanol is still being developed and is far from mature , " says a National Resources Defense Council report titled " Ethanol : Energy Well Spent . "
Yet other challenges may loom for the cellulosic golden goose .
" The joker in that deck is when switchgrass and wood chips can be turned into cellulose ethanol , what happens to these guys who invested in the corn ethanol plants ? " asks Dennis Avery at the Center for Global Food Issues at the Hudson Institute , a Washington , D.C. , think tank .
" The cellulose plants are going to be in different places .
There will be an intense lobbying war , and the best fuel wo n't win .
The best lobbying program will . "
But the Renewable Fuels Association 's Hartwig flatly dismisses warnings of erupting lobbying skirmishes over subsidies and tax preferences .
" It wo n't replace corn , " he says .
" Many of the corn farmers today will still be involved in the cellulosic side because they 'll use some of the leftover corn stalks . "
Yet even the defense council 's Greene concedes that renewable fuels wo n't come close to replacing projected transportation fuel demand .
The reason : land .
At current cellulosic crop yields , it would take 1.75 billion acres to meet projected 2050 light - duty gasoline demand .
Total landmass in the contiguous 48 states is about 1.9 billion acres .
Another looming question :
What happens if the food value of a crop drops below its fuel value ?
" The world 's demand for food and feed is going to double again , " warns the Hudson Institute 's Avery .
Malaysia , the leading producer and exporter of palm oil , a potent fuel crop , is rapidly expanding its biodiesel production with some 52 refineries in the works and plans to be the top global biodiesel producer .
This has some environmentalists worried this will usher in a new round of rain forest destruction as the lush , humid lands in Southeast Asia are cleared for palm cultivation to feed these new refineries .
" There is a tendency among biofuels boosters to make it sound like we can do everything with biofuels , and critics tend to say you can't do everything with corn , " Greene says .
" There 's a limit , even with advanced technologies that we are really excited about . "
That 's why Greene 's strategy for slashing projected year 2050 transportation fuel consumption by two - thirds — from 30 million barrels of oil per day down to 10 million — does n't rely primarily on biofuels .
In a report titled " Growing Energy , How Biofuels Help End America 's Oil Independence , " Greene argues that most U.S. transportation fuel consumption must be reduced through dramatic engine and vehicle efficiency gains coupled with what he calls smart growth , or planned communities that curtail sprawl by offering walkable neighborhoods near jobs , services and public transportation to cut drive time .
But while such communities may seem practical , even desirable , in theory , it 's difficult to see how they could be workable , especially in metropolitan areas like Los Angeles , San Francisco , Chicago and New York , where extremely high housing and living costs shove low - to moderate - income workers to the outer suburbs .
Walkable communities near public transit hubs are highly desirable — witness Mockingbird Station — and developers and merchants charge accordingly .
Even more illusory is the realization of significant energy consumption reductions via increased efficiency , if history is any guide .
According to the Department of Energy , annual per capita energy consumption was actually slightly higher in 2005 than it was in 1970 : 337 million Btu ( British thermal units ) versus 334 million Btu .
The data show energy consumption levels have remained relatively constant over the past 35 years — this despite enormous efficiency gains in everything from power generation to vehicle engines to home appliances and electronics .
The reason ?
Consumers apparently leverage efficiency gains not toward energy savings , but toward higher standards of living .
More efficient engines translate into heavier vehicles traveling more miles with more power and safety and convenience features .
More efficient aircraft and jet engine designs mean more people fly more often to more places at greater distances while demanding fresh sushi in Chicago .
More efficient AC power supplies batteries , and computer processors mean iPods , cell phones , digital cameras , massive televisions and computers proliferate in millions of homes — many plugged into the Internet , itself a vast network of computer server farms that , individually , gobble enough energy to feed a small city .
In short , if we want to avert an alleged global warming cataclysm , we 'll not only have to cut back on driving , we 'll have to cut back on American Idol and blogging too .
The genius behind Panda Energy 's " poop - to - pump " ethanol plant in Hereford is that it skirts many of the meager energy gains and environmental criticisms lodged against the ethanol production process .
Because the plant is fueled not by a useful energy source but by what is essentially a nuisance waste , energy consumption levels in the refining process become irrelevant : Mostly useless manure becomes a valuable fuel .
And because decaying manure yields emissions — namely methane — that are far more potent greenhouse gases than carbon dioxide , emissions from Panda 's plant are benign in context .
This is why Panda is replicating its manure blueprint in Sherman and Kansas .
" One of the problems with biomass is finding an area that has enough biomass fuel of any significance to make the project work , " says Panda CEO Todd Carter .
This is also why the usefulness of Panda 's blueprint is extremely limited .
Yet the general concept is n't .
Energy Products of Idaho ( EPI ) , the company that designed the manure gasification component of Panda 's ethanol plant , also builds power plants fueled by garbage .
The benefits are stunning .
Respiring landfills spew a host of noxious emissions into the atmosphere , including carbon monoxide and methane .
Gasifying the garbage and using those gases as fuel to generate electricity or potentially power an ethanol refinery is not only environmentally beneficial , it 's potentially lucrative : Municipalities pay people to take their garbage .
Yet EPI 's Kent Pope , whose company has built just four such power plants in the United States , says developers of such projects face fierce " NIMBY " ( not in my back yard ) opposition , tying up plant developers in court until they throw up their hands in surrender .
His projects receive a far warmer reception in Europe , where landfill space is far tighter .
" You do n't want to create an incentive to produce garbage , " Greene argues .
" Our production of garbage today is a function of our consumption patterns , which are themselves unsustainable . "
" Wonderful , " Pope counters .
" Eliminate all you can .
And then with the other 97 percent that you can't eliminate , let 's produce energy .
Let 's not just throw it into the ground . "
Dr. Chris Bachmann , an alternative fuels researcher at James Madison University in Harrisonburg , Virginia , is exploring an even more outlandish fuel source : algae .
He says algae can potentially produce more than 30 times the biodiesel oil per acre of the most productive biodiesel crops such as canola and palm .
Plus , once perfected , the leftover biomass can be converted into cellulosic ethanol for even more fuel gains .
This means destructive algae blooms from fertilizer runoff polluting bays and other waterways might someday be profitably harvested as fuel .
" These micro algae are some of the fastest - growing plants on the planet if you give them the CO2 they need , " Bachmann says .
That 's why he 's exploring closed loop " bioreactors " that feed on nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide emissions from coal - fired power plants , essentially creating bio-scrubbers that generate motor fuels .
With these systems , he says , fuel - producing algae can be harvested daily instead of the once or twice per year fuel crops are harvested on land .
But maximizing the process will require genetic engineering to accelerate algae growth rates and fuel output .
He 's also studying processes to transplant genes that produce the enzymes that break down cellulose from fungi into bacteria , which grow much faster .
" There 's going to be a lot of that , " he says of genetically modified fuel organisms .
Yet environmentalists , who heartily endorse renewable fuels , are almost universally opposed to genetic modification , which may prove the key to making these fuels feasible on a large scale .
The upshot ?
Fossil fuels will in all likelihood be our most significant fuel source by far for a long time , at least through the next century .
No plausible combination of alternative fuels or efficiency gains can substitute in any significance for projected oil consumption growth in the foreseeable future — at least not without onerous taxes and police state tactics .
The potential alternatives may be exciting and numerous , but the challenges and compromises they encumber are daunting .
The body of Tonderai Ndira was found this week , the 43rd Zimbabwean opposition activist to die in violence since elections in March .
Journalist Farai Sevenzo looks back at his life and the circumstances leading up to his murder .
It is clear that the change we were waiting for is here .
If we do not get it , the people must rise up and fight for their victory
Tonderai Ndira Tonderai Ndira lived in the desperately poor township of Mabvuku and Tafara , east of Harare .
He was no stranger to the Zimbabwean police and at one stage had 38 charges levelled against him , ranging from " political nuisance " to attempted murder .
He was one of a group of young men and women , barely in their thirties , who formed the backbone of the opposition 's ranks .
Theirs was the thankless and arduous task of mobilising moribund , disillusioned and tired folk to believe in this new concept called change and to sign up to the messages of the eight - year - old opposition - the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) .
On election day , 29 March , the tall and charismatic Ndira was hanging around by what passes for shops in his sewage - ridden constituency , where electricity is erratic and where cholera has already claimed lives in the last 12 months .
No presidential candidate won the first round of voting outright I asked him what he felt that day would bring , and if , given the history of elections in this country , the day would make any difference .
" It is clear that the change we were waiting for is here .
If we do not get it , the people must rise up and fight for their victory , " he said .
Rising up and fighting for victory pits one against the awesome strength of the security machinery the state has at its disposal .
That is an undisputed fact in the history of this country 's opposition .
It is an impossible task .
Beyond politics
In the weeks following polling day , a campaign of intimidation was unfurled which largely affected opposition people rather than ruling party folk .
He was campaigning for things like better streets , more rubbish collections , healthy water supplies
ZimRights official Huts and houses were torched on both sides of the political divide ; images of the beaten and tortured were wired around the world , and diplomats based in Harare collected eyewitness accounts of the horrors being unleashed in the countryside by people variously described as war veterans , militias or soldiers .
It was with this background that Tonderai Ndira continued to lend his leadership to the idea of democratic change , and his activism went beyond the politics of the MDC .
An official from human rights organisation ZimRights , who declined to be named , outlined what Ndira meant to civic society in and around Harare .
" I knew him personally , he was a youth activist who went around the country holding workshops and teaching people their rights .
" He was very active in the Combined Harare Residents Association - campaigning for things like better streets , more rubbish collections , healthy water supplies .
" And so he became a target for the Zanu - PF , because they are targeting active members . "
And why would such people become targets of the ruling party ?
" They know that if people like Ndira are removed , there will be less likelihood of an uprising . "
Disappearances Ordinarily it was a mission to find Ndira .
Ndira would sometimes disappear for days on end He would venture into the centre of town for the odd demonstration and then disappear for days on end .
His wife and three young children became used to the idea of him coming home after weeks away because a healthy sense of paranoia was needed to avoid spurious charges and lengthy stays in remand prison .
But on Tuesday 13 May , according to his friends and eyewitnesses , Ndira came home and slept the sleep of the exhausted in Mabvuku township .
At around 0645 , a pick - up truck packed with 10 men arrived on his narrow street and drove past his house , stopping at the neighbours .
The 10 men were armed with revolvers and AK - 47s - some of them wore masks .
The neighbour 's child duly told them the right address and they reversed , disembarked and told Ndira 's wife they were looking for her husband .
The presence of so many armed men frightened her into calling out his name and announcing that there were people there to see him .
He answered with a voice drunk with sleep and asked her to tell them to come by later , as he needed his rest .
We are like chickens waiting for the knife to reach our throats
Tonderai Ndira 's brother Cosmas
He was abducted in his underwear , in front of his young children as they were heading to school and beaten into the truck until he was bleeding .
In the ensuing week , his family and friends desperately tried to locate him .
The omens were not good , several activists had been found dead and funerals were happening throughout the city and the rural areas - all connected to Zimbabwe 's protracted political impasse .
On Wednesday , the MDC went to claim two more bodies from Harare 's Parirenyatwa Hospital morgue .
Party officials were told by the mortician there was another body that had not been claimed .
Unrecognisable
This new body was badly decomposed ; a pair of bloody shorts was plastered to a face clearly broken and shattered .
MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai has not been in Zimbabwe for over a month " We only knew it was my brother by his distinctive ring , his bangles , and his unmistakeable height , " said Cosmas Ndira , as family and friends filled his small home to mourn his passing before his funeral , which is yet to be finalised .
" His jaw was shattered , his knuckles broken , a bullet hole below his heart , many many stab wounds and a large hole at the back of his head which seemed to have been caused by a hammer . "
Jimmy Chidakwa , a colleague and fellow activist , struggled to contain his anger both at the assassins and his party 's leadership .
" They are cowards , all of them .
Ten men to take down one unarmed man .
" And where are our leaders ?
Out of the country . "
I know so many people now too frightened to vote with their hearts come the run-off
Activist Jimmy Chidakwa Cosmas chipped in : " Yes , we are like chickens waiting for the knife to reach our throats .
" Given his position in the party , my brother should have had more protection .
" I know so many people now too frightened to vote with their hearts come the run-off . "
Unlike the opposition leadership , who are not here and have been at pains to tell the world of diplomatic efforts under way as they travel - to Botswana , South Africa , Kenya , the UN headquarters in New York - the foot soldiers like Tonderai Ndira remained on the ground , visiting the injured , co-ordinating relief efforts to the displaced .
The opposition may yet feel the full force of the loss of such urban activists in the weeks to come as the country heads for the presidential run-off on 27 June .

What are these ?
Romania is buying 48 U.S. F - 16 fighters for $ 4.5 billion .
Half will be the latest model , the F - 16C / 50 .
The others will be used , and reconditioned to F - 16C / 25 standards .
Romania could have waited a few years and bought the new F - 35 instead , but that would have cost them more money ( nearly $ 6 billion for just 24 ) .
Romania did the math and realized that 48 F - 16s would be more than adequate to handle any neighborhood spats .
And if Russia became a problem , Romania is now a member of NATO , and capable of calling on some very big allies .
While the U.S. still have about 1,300 F - 16s in service ( about half with reserve units ) , over 4,200 were produced , and America has hundreds in storage .
The end of the Cold War in 1991 led to a sharp cut in U.S. Air Force fighter squadrons .
Moreover , the new F - 35 will be replacing all U.S. F - 16s in the next decade .
So the U.S. has plenty of little - used F - 16s sitting around , and an ally that it would like to beef up militarily .
F - 16s are still produced for export , and these cost as much as $ 70 million each ( the F - 16 I for Israel ) .
Some nations , like South Korea , build the F - 16 under license .
A used F - 16C , built in the 1990s , would go for about $ 10 million on the open market .
The 16 ton F - 16 has an admirable combat record , and is very popular with pilots .
It has been successful at ground support as well .
When equipped with 4 - 6 smart bombs , it is a very effective bomber .
our current package format is somewhat similar in idea to Gentoos ebuilds but is completely incompatible due to the many technical differences .
our naming of variables , phases and libraries describes the concepts much better compared to Gentoo .
we have several new phases allowing much better control of the build process .
our options handling is much improved compared to the USE flags of Gentoo .
the default functions provided for various phases removes the need for explicit phase functions from most packages .
we 're not afraid of huge changes to the package format .
Most distributions sucks badly in the way they handle crosscompiling , multilib and other fun stuff
work is ongoing on this topic and there 'll probably be huge changes but we have a fairly decent idea how to handle all the multi stuff sanely .
We 're writing a completely new initsystem free of all the weird , useless legacy stuff and based on user needs in the 21st century .
I 'll be talking about this at the FOSS Aalborg conference in Aalborg , Denmark on june 4th .
Slides will be made available after the conference .
we take a no bullshit approach to our work and are n't afraid to tell each other when something sucks and take it at face value .
we keep the developer team small on purpose - there 's much less bullshit this way and we can all agree on the direction needed for Exherbo .
Open source is said to be about scratching your particular itches - and I 'vebeen working my butt off for the last several months along with a small , select team of developers doing just that .
All our hard work have so far resulted in a very experimental linux
distribution that 's definitely not ready for users yet ( or even developers ) but does have quite a few interesting ideas and features .
In particular we 've been working on and continue to focus on :
We have lots of additional features and ideas for the future planned that wehave n't even started on yet so Exherbo is expected to be in turmoil for quitea while yet .
That said I think we have an interesting base already andinterested people are encouraged to take a look at it .
Just do n't expectanything to work ( seriously ! ) .
Ongoing development is pretty fast and we 'restill at a stage where we happily break everything without second thoughts toinstalled Exherbo systems or users .
More info is available on http://www.exherbo.org .
More specific questions canbe asked in #exherbo on the freenode irc network ( point your irc client atchat.freenode.net ) or by / msg'ing me directly ( I 'm using the nick ' kloeri ' ) oremailing me at kloeri@exherbo.org .

The jolly old car you see on these pages is n't just a quaint antique .
It is the machine that changed everything .
And it is a centenarian .
According to your point of view , the Model T Ford , launched in Detroit in 1908 , either marks the moment when the fun started – the point where the convenience and comfort of the modern car for all replaced our historic reliance on domesticated animals for personal transportation – or the birth of the Model T represents the terrible moment when we started out on a road that has led us to the beginning of the end of our lovely planet .
Or very possibly both , given that no one had heard of global warming back then .
So we can reasonably celebrate the significance of the Model T while fully recognising that , all things considered , and bearing in mind the survival of the polar ice caps , the Maldives and East Anglia , it might have better if we 'd stuck with four legs rather opting for four wheels .
Then again , there have been some frightening estimates of the volumes of " carbon " emissions that might have been left on our roads by a multitude of horses after a century of economic expansion .
The truth is that what Ford and his little troupe of engineers came up were two remarkable machines , dependent on one another , and both still with us , in a way .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The first machine , the Model T Ford , was a sturdy , comfortable , reliable method for humans to get around and , yes , have some fun .
The second machine was the modern manufacturing corporation , of which more later .
The Model T was n't easy to drive , as I discovered .
Taking a 1915 example from the Ford heritage collection in and around our own monument to Ford , Dagenham , made me wonder about that vision .
First , you must start it with a crank handle .
Hold this the wrong way and your opposable thumb will follow Tin Lizzie into the history books .
In the 1920s firms such as the Non-Kick Device Company of Kansas City , Mo , advertised an improved starting handle under the heading " Broken Arms Prevented " .
The romance of motoring .
Second , the T creeps forward as soon as you start , so you have to scuttle round quickly to get in .
In " Farewell , my Lovely ! " , an elegy to the Model T written for the New Yorker in 1936 which has never been bettered , E B White took this as the last vestige of horsiness in the horseless carriage : " I can still feel my old Ford nuzzling me at the curb , as though looking for an apple in my pocket . "
Ahh !
Then you get in .
Even allowing for the fact that an Edwardian driver might be just as flummoxed by the Sat Nav fitted to a 2008 Focus in " Titanium " trim , I found myself hopelessly in a tin tizzy .
You have to use a lever and a pedal to change up and down all of two gears ( plus another pedal for reverse ) and the throttle is where the indicators ought to be .
There is no clutch .
It has a " epicyclical " or " planetary " gears system , like its thermosyphon cooling system and vanadium steel construction .
These wonderfully named features were breathtakingly modern in 1908 .
But if you 're unlucky enough to panic when unexpectedly approached by a speeding bus , and slam the same pedals you would in a Focus , you may find yourself travelling very fast indeed in reverse ...
Majestically enthroned , you 're really far too exposed for comfort .
Look down and a brass bolt tops the cast iron steering column pointed directly at your heart , while your bottom nestles directly above the petrol tank .
When you took your " flivver " on the road a hundred years ago , you did without the benefit of air bags and with no seat belts , no heater , no speedometer , no windscreen wiper , no rear view mirror , no temperature gauge , no side windows , no cup holders , no ... well , no nonsense really .
In the Model T you know you 're doing less than 40 mph , and that 's data enough .
Such was the brave new world of mass motoring .
With a 10 - gallon tank and 20 miles per gallon fuel economy , the first Model T had a range in excess of the combined total of properly laid roads in the United States at the time ( 155 miles ) .
They made more than 15 million of them in 20 years .
Its main rival was n't a Honda or Hyundai , but the horse , or " Dobbin " as Ford patronised him in their ads .
In September 1913 , the competition was attacked in these terms by the Ford Motor Company : " Old Dobbin , the family coach horse , weighs more than a Ford car .
But –
He has only one - twentieth the strength of a Ford car – cannot go as fast nor as far – costs more to maintain – almost as much to acquire . "
Persuading punters to choose a car over a horse may seem a bit of a no - brainer nowadays , but then it obviously required a talented ad copywriter , another trade that , largely unacknowledged , the Model T and its peers did much to create .
The second machine Ford created was the modern manufacturing corporation , a machine for making money first and things second : Fordism .
It served as a template for modern industry that , adapted and improved by many since , and troubled financially as it is now , has survived .
It is not too fanciful to say that Ford re-engineered capitalism , intensifying its already brutalising tendency to crush the human spirit , but spreading its benefits too , quickly forming itself into what we now call a transnational corporation .
Satirised by Charlie Chaplin in Modern Times and demonised in Aldous Huxley 's Brave New World ( where the Ford Motor Company takes over the world ) , the Model T and its factories were replicated on every continent , an early example of globalisation .
Fittingly for the forceful personality who made all this possible , Henry 's signature , now on a famous blue oval , still adorns every car made in his name .
Maybe the ruthless , unsentimental Henry would n't appreciate this little retrospective .
He was a determined modernist who probably would n't have much time for his pioneering car nowadays .
He really did say : " History is more or less bunk .
It is tradition .
We want to live in the present , and the only history that is worth a tinker 's dam is the history we make today . "
You can maybe see where he got his reputation for anti-intellectualism from .
Anyway , he did make history , and the fortune he made was worth more than a tinker 's dam , about $ 190bn at today 's prices , or three to four times whatever Bill Gates may be worth .
According to one survey , Ford was the seventh richest man ever to live , and one of the first of the modern breed of billionaire businessmen ( in the days when a billion really was worth boasting about ) .
Before Ford , Carnegie , Mellon and the rest , mankind 's super - rich were all feudal types – pharaohs , kings and tsars – who stole or inherited their cash , rather than the hard - working , madly driven visionary sons of immigrants .
The obscene differences in economic power we ponder today are older than we suppose .
To be fair , Ford amassed his fortune and founded a dynasty not by robbing or taxing us , but by making us better off , raising our standard of living by bringing the motor car – and by example much else – within reach .
Just like Mr Gates did with his software .
The Model T Ford thus demonstrated that capitalism is not a zero-sum game .
Everyone can win , which annoys some people .
Ask yourself why we complacently expect the price of the new technological and electronic wonders of our time to continually fall until such point that they become virtually disposable ?
Why does a £ 10 DVD player – that would have cost 20 times that a decade ago – fail to amaze us ?
Because that 's what the Model T led us to expect , as a right .
Before the T , it was pretty much the case that only the wealthy could own an automobile .
Most were hand built , and the toys of the rich .
The Rolls - Royce Silver Ghost that came out the year before Henry 's Model T , and which remained a benchmark for refinement and performance for decades after , was a more typical product of the industry , although American makers were starting to become more conscious of the potential of the middle - class market .
Europe invented the car , but the Americans democratised it .
None more so than Ford .
While most cars of the era commanded a price of $ 2,000 or more , the Model T came in at just $ 825 .
By 1925 the price was down to $ 260 .
It could be bought with a few months wages by a Ford worker .
How did they do it ?
What Henry Ford and the Model T did was to pull together a lot of things that already existed better than anyone else had before .
The Ford plants , some of which grew to be the biggest in the world , were cathedrals to the modern religion of productionism , but Ford was not the first man to build dark Satanic mills .
Economies of scale had been observed for many decades .
The slaughterhouses of Chicago were the inspiration for Ford 's moving assembly line technique .
Ford 's engineers saw how workers specialised in just one task , monotonously performed over and over at a pace set by the conveyor belt ( rather than any natural rhythm ) .
The ones in Chicago were known as " disassembly " lines , and Ford simply put the idea in reverse .
Such division and specialisation of labour was advocated way back in Adam Smith 's The Wealth of Nations , published in 1776 .
Making standard interchangeable parts was a big factor in the Model T's serviceability and success ( and today 's scrapyards are a direct consequence of the practice ) but the French had developed the technique in their guns during the Napoleonic wars .
Ransom Eli Olds ' " curved dash " Oldsmobile of 1902 has a better claim than the T to be the world 's first mass produced car .
Even the old " you can have any colour so long as it's black " saying is a bit of a myth .
Ford may never have said this , and his cars were available in a variety of shades from 1908 to 1914 and 1926 - 27 , its last year .
However , the 1916 brochure clearly states that " no option is given on color , tires , or equipment " and the majority were black , possibly because that was the colour of paint that dried fastest – and thus kept the assembly line moving quickest .
Ford 's idea of a " universal car " was taken up by Ferdinand Porsche and Adolf Hitler with their own take on the people 's car , the Volkswagen – a Model T with the engine in the wrong place that would eventually overtake it in sales , though many decades later .
Stalin too was an admirer of Ford 's methods , applied with still more ferocity in his five - year plans .
Nowadays , from Malaysia to Slovakia to Brazil , the car industry with all its ancillary industries and its potential for export earnings , is regarded as the key industry to foster economic growth .
We in the west may no longer work in factories much , and have entered the post - Fordism age , but there are plenty of our fellow human beings still doing things as Henry dictated .
A few weeks ago another famous industrialist announced that he was to create a car that would industrialise and motorise his fast - growing nation with its vast distances and appalling roads .
This time , exactly a century on from Henry and the Model T , comes another " T " – a Tata .
Ratan Tata and his Tata Nano – the " one lakh " ( ca £ 1,200 ) car .
It wo n't do much for climate change , but it 's quite a flattering tribute to the abiding power of Ford 's vision .
Motoring milestones 1959 - present day
1886
Benz Patent Motorwagen
Motoring as we know it began on 29 January 1886 , when a patent was filed for this " horseless carriage " – the first car with an internal combustion engine .
Named after its German inventor , Karl Benz , the Motorwagen was both revolutionary and very , very slow : it could barely top 10 mph .
1907
Rolls - Royce Silver Ghost
The last word in refinement , the Silver Ghost was a must - have for Edwardian Lords and Viscounts .
Its luxury heralded the end of the horse and carriage as the aristocracy 's preferred mode of transport .
Adverts billed it : " Silent as a Ghost , Powerful as a Lion , and Trustworthy as Time " .
1936
Volkswagen Beetle
The " people 's car " company was founded by the Nazis when Adolf Hitler instructed his fellow Austrian , Dr Ferdinand Porsche , to dream up some wheels able to transport two adults and three children for less than £ 50 .
Manufacturing on the Bug did not actually begin in Germany until after the war .
1941
Willys - Overland Jeep
In the words of American President and D - Day General Dwight Eisenhower , the Willys - Overland Jeep was one of the " weapons that won the Allies the war " .
Over 330,000 of these iconic 4x4s were produced by American factories , serving in every theatre of the Second World War .
1947
Land Rover
Where would farmers be without the Land Rover ?
First unveiled at the Amsterdam motor show , early models were made from both steel and aluminium , due to the rationing of steel and post - war abundance of aluminium , which had been used to make aircraft .
The first in a legendary line , many Series 1 Land Rovers can still be seen on our roads .
1949
Citroen 2CV
More French than a string of onions this design classic has been adored and derided in equal measure .
Created after the Second World War , it was first marketed as an " umbrella on wheels " that could transport eggs without cracking them .
Between 1948 and 1990 about four million cars were sold .
1957
Fiat 500
The car that got Italy on the move .
Fiat 's practical and affordable 500 was just three metres long , but its quirkily stylish profile ensured that it became a huge hit across the whole of Europe .
Production did n't end till 1975 – and a modern version was re-launched last year .
1958
Saab 93
Saab pioneered aerodynamic design , perhaps because it also made fighter aircraft .
The 93 first achieved fame on the rally circuit , but its lasting legacy was in the field of safety : it was the first mass production car to have seatbelts as standard , leading Mercedes - Benz ( and later every other manufacturer ) to follow suit soon afterwards .
1959
Austin Mini
This revolutionary design was created by British Motoring Corporation boss Leonard Lord – who stipulated that 60 per cent of its length should be interior space – and designer Alec Issigonis .
Minis later became a cult car , thanks to Michael Caine and The Italian Job .
1959
Mercedes - Benz " heckflosse "
The sleek but datable Mercedes - Benz " heckflosse " – or " fintail " – was the first production car with crumple zones .
Captains of industry could buy the chrome - laden 300SEL model , with air suspension and fuel - injected engine ; those on a more stringent budget could fire up the 190 diesel , which retailed at a third of the price .
1961
Jaguar E-type
The sexiest car ever made .
Originally developed as a racer , the E - type was subsequently adapted for use on British roads , and became a symbol of the swinging Sixties .
Some models of this ( relatively ) cheap motor were able to top the 150 mph milestone .
1966
Toyota Corolla
The Corolla was the first mass - market car to have a radio fitted as standard .
It was also the first Japanese car to threaten the American and European dominance of the industry , thanks to its efficiency .
Toyota 's " just in time " production method was later copied across the world .
1971
Fiat 127
Small , fun , and perfectly formed , the 127 was the first modern supermini .
Even the car 's 903 cc engine punched above its weight , giving performance more akin to a modern 1500 cc .
It could do 0 - 60 mph in a then - impressive 15 seconds , and over 12 years more than four million rolled off the production line .
1976
Volkswagen Golf GTI
The car that made hatches " hot " hit the road three years after the Golf was launched .
With a souped - up engine and go - faster stripes , it became the car of choice for spotty youths , who were soon " pimping " their rides with under - lighting and racing seats .
It spawned a generation of imitators , from the Fiat Uno Turbo to the Suzuki Swift Sport .
1997
Toyota Prius
The first commercial hybrid car was produced in Japan and launched in the UK four years later .
Since becoming fashionable among ecologically aware Hollywood celebrities – converts include Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz – it has inspired a legion of impressionable " civilian " consumers to follow suit .
2002
Honda FC-X
We 've had hybrid , electric and biofuel cars , but the future of green motoring is probably hydrogen .
The FC - X looks like being the first commercially viable hydrogen fuel - cell car .
It looks like a bog standard saloon from the outside , but things get clever under the bonnet : it runs on hydrogen and emits nothing more harmless than water .
2008
Tata Nano
Can the world afford this car ?
With a price tag of just £ 1,277 , the Nano was launched this year on a promise of bringing cheap motoring to India 's rapidly growing middle class .
Yet , for all the social freedom and mobility , getting India on the road could herald a global warming disaster .

fotolog.pl :: forum :: wróć
NEW YORK 
More than four months after Amazon.com released the Kindle , no one is sure whether the latest e-book reader is really hot — or not .
But publishers believe that the Kindle has helped , if not revolutionized , the tiny electronic market .
Amazon.com has received extensive media coverage since unveiling the Kindle on the Monday before Thanksgiving and announcing that the first run had sold out within a few hours .
Amazon.com has declined to give sales figures for the Kindle — at least 2,000 , judging from the number of customer reviews — but has said repeatedly that supply is not keeping up with demand , with the device often out of stock .
Publishing officials are reluctant to discuss sales figures , but say that they have seen double digit increases in e-book sales since the Kindle 's release , including renewed interest in downloads on the Sony Reader .
Sales for the most popular books are in the hundreds , comparable to the number for the Sony , which came out in 2006 .
" The Kindle has increased awareness .
Publishers have told me that in some cases the Sony numbers were double or triple to what they had been , " says Michael Smith , head of the International Digital Publishing Forum , which tracks e-book sales .
Selling through Amazon.com for $ 399 , Kindle is thinner than most paperbacks and weighs 10.3 ounces .
It can hold some 200 books , along with newspapers , magazines and an entire dictionary .
The Kindle has been praised for its selection , more than 100,000 books , blogs and newspapers , and for the speed of delivery , less than a minute .
Fans include such authors as Nobel laureate Toni Morrison , Michael Lewis and Neil Gaiman .
In a review last November , AP technology writer Peter Svensson called the Kindle in " some ways an amazing device , " citing its full - alphabet keyboard and " rudimentary Web browser that allows you to surf for free . "
But he also noted several flaws , including " its poor battery life , making it hard to see it as a game - changer . "
Publishing is older by centuries than the music and film industries and its form of communication , the paper text , has proved far more durable than the vinyl record , eight - track tape or videocassette .
New technologies , from the compact disc to the DVD , are usually more convenient and more effective than the ones they replace .
But no e-book device has approached the practical and aesthetic appeal of the traditional book .
" Books themselves are very efficient machines , and the experience of holding a book is part of the book culture , " says Farrar , Straus & Giroux publisher Jonathan Galassi , who called the Kindle " flimsy " and said it reminded him of an Etch - a - Sketch toy .
" E - books are a growing niche for now , " Smith says , " but I certainly do n't see a time when everybody will be reading them .
People just love what the traditional book represents to them . "
E - books undeniably are growing .
According to the International Digital Publishing Forum , sales have risen steadily over the past six years , from around $ 6 million in 2002 to around $ 33 million in 2007 .
Those numbers do not include many smaller publishers , or library and educational purchases , making it likely — Smith and others believe — that the market for downloads is at least two or three times larger .
Each advance inevitably leads to speculation about a post - paper world : Would bookstores become obsolete ?
How would publishers handle online piracy ?
Would authors , like some musicians , become their own bosses , bypassing the industry altogether ?
E- books have been around for more than a decade and speculation peaked in 2000 - 2001 , the height of the dot.com boom .
Several publishing houses set up e-book divisions , and an annual e-book prize , a $ 50,000 award co-sponsored by Microsoft , was started .
Even Barnes & Noble formed its own e-book line , launching the brand with an original work by Dean Koontz .
The electronic future , bookseller Michael Powell of Powell 's Books said in 2000 , was " coming down the road at lightning speed . "
Few are so bold anymore .
Even after tripling their reported sales , e-books are less than 1 % of the $ 35 billion publishing business and likely to remain so .
The e-book divisions have been shut down , the e-book award no longer exists .
Barnes & Noble has abandoned the e-book field .
" The market is very narrowly confined , to New York and Seattle and to a few people who travel and read a lot , " says Frank Daniels III , chief operating officer for Ingram Digital , a leading e-distributor .
" The Kindle is certainly an important next step , but I do n't think it signifies the end of the evolution , " Smith says .
" It 's all incremental , one step that takes place down the line , like in the audiobook industry . "
E - books have made their greatest progress with their first audience : publishers .
For years , publishers resisted the product they were supposed to be pushing .
In a 2001 interview , the head of the Association of American Publishers , Patricia Schroeder , rolled her eyes when asked about e-book devices : " I just look at these things and they 're fine , but I just think ... "
In a recent AP interview , Schroeder spoke favorably of e-books , but said she still had not read one .
Public sightings of e-books remain rare compared to iPods or iPhones , but e-book readers have caught on in the industry .
The Hachette Book Group USA , Simon & Schuster and Random House , Inc. are among those using Sony Readers ( which sell for $ 299 ) to review manuscripts and executives are far more likely to say they 've read an e-book .
" It 's not a conversation I 'm having with people outside the industry , but I think people will increasingly use e-books .
They 'll be a niche , like audiobooks .
I think that 's the best comparison , " says Jonathan Karp , publisher of the Hachette imprint , Twelve .
" I actually read in bed with the Sony e-reader , and I love it .
It 's lighter than a regular book , and easier to turn the pages than with a manuscript .
I do n't have to lug books back and forth .
I 'm saving paper .
It 's wonderful . "

Or if this is your first experience with my tutorials , get ready for a good time .
But first , why another red black tree tutorial ?
Anyone who searches for red black trees on Google will be rewarded with a slew of resources that include tutorials , general descriptions , Java applets , papers , libraries , and power point presentations .
This is good , but not good enough .
Most resources are content with only looking at insertion ( slackers ! ) .
Others fail to describe deletion in such a way that one can easily understand why it works , obviously thinking that enumerating the cases should be enough .
Even worse , every resource fails to notice that red black trees can be written several different ways .
Well guys , I ’m not that smart .
Insertion into a red black tree is painfully simple .
Any programmer with half a brain and a little experience with binary search trees can figure it out with minimal effort .
Deletion on the other hand is , quite frankly , a pain in the ass .
I had better luck independently rediscovering the cases than trying to figure out why some of the traditional cases are used .
For example , a sibling should be black , so a special case makes it so , yet nobody seems to know why .
After dealing with that case , I can both tell you and show you why ( it ’s not called a case reduction for nothing ) .
When it comes to red black trees , there is only one widely accepted resource : “ Introduction to Algorithms ” by Cormen , Leiserson , and Rivest , affectionately known as CLR .
This is a good resource because not only does it describe both insertion and deletion , it gives sufficient pseudocode for both operations !
As the only well known and easily accessible text that does this , just about every red black tree in the real world uses a translation of the CLR algorithms .
Unfortunately , CLR ’s approach is both complicated and inefficient , through heavy use of parent pointers .
Red black trees do n’t have to be that hard .
I learned red black trees the hard way .
Given only a description of the rules , I worked through every case I could think of while trying to devise an algorithm .
Without a copy of CLR ( I still do n’t own it ) , I was n’t able to see how the problem was meant to be solved .
This is a good thing because I “ discovered ” several ways of doing it , and I believe that I peeled away most of the complexity .
I cut myself on the sharp edges of the algorithms , I wept from frustration trying to get them to work , and now I ’ll share the results of that effort so that you do n’t have to go through the same ordeal .
This tutorial will cover both the non-recursive top - down and recursive bottom - up algorithms for red black insertion and deletion , as well as provide full C source code for all variations described .
The most common implementation is based off of the pseudocode from CLR , but I wo n’t cover that because it ’s just another implementation of the bottom - up process .
If you ’re interested in how to implement red black trees with parent pointers , either CLR or Ben Pfaff ’s excellent online book will serve you well .
If you ’re interested in a non-recursive red black implementation using an explicit stack instead of recursion , Ben Pfaff ’s online book also covers this .
I see no point in reproducing something that is dealt with adequately elsewhere .
Concept
Basic binary search trees are simple data structures that boast O ( log N ) search , insertion , and deletion .
For the most part this is true , assuming that the data arrives in random order , but basic binary search trees have three very nasty degenerate cases where the structure stops being logarithmic and becomes a glorified linked list .
The two most common of these degenerate cases is ascending or descending sorted order ( the third is outside - in alternating order ) .
Because binary search trees store their data in such a way that can be considered sorted , if the data arrives already sorted , this causes problems .
Consider adding the values 0,1,2,3, 4 to a binary search tree .
Since each new item is greater in value than the last , it will be linked to the right subtree of every item before it :
0 \ 1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4
That ’s not a very good binary search tree .
The performance degrades from O ( log N ) to O ( N ) because the tree is now effectively a linear data structure .
We would rather have two choices at each node instead of just one .
This way we can take full advantage of the two - way design of binary search trees :
1 / \ 0 3 / \ 2 4
Many brain cells have perished trying to come up with an easy way to guarantee this optimum structure , which is called a balanced binary search tree .
Unfortunately , it takes far too much work to maintain a perfectly balanced binary search tree , so it ’s impossible to efficiently guarantee perfect balance at all times .
However , we can come close enough to guarantee logarithmic performance .
Several of these “ close enough ” balancing schemes are in common use , and the two forerunners are AVL trees and red black trees .
Because I have another tutorial on AVL trees , we will only cover red black trees in detail here .
Red black trees were originally an abstraction of an abstraction that managed to become a concrete data structure of their own .
The original abstraction was suggested by Rudolf Bayer , which he called symmetric binary B - trees .
The idea was to simulate a B - tree of order 4 ( each node can have at most 4 links where a binary tree can have at most 2 ) .
Because all paths from the root to a leaf contain the same number of nodes , all leaves are at the same level in a B - tree .
This is a perfectly balanced tree , but it ’s not a binary search tree , which is what was desired .
The basic idea behind the symmetric binary B - tree is that a node can have horizontal or vertical links .
In this way a binary search tree can simulate the structure of B - tree nodes .
A vertical link separates two different nodes and a horizontal link separates nodes that are treated logically as the same B - tree node .
The equivalent B - tree and symmetric binary B - tree ( SBB - tree ) nodes are as follows (* = Unknown node ) .
Notice how the B - tree node ’s structure is faked using multiple binary tree nodes :
Here is this video of Geeks Tutorial talking about How to Buy On Amazon
2-node SBB - tree B- tree 0 0 / \ -> / \ * * * * 3 - node SBB - tree 1 SBB - tree 2 B- tree 1 0 0 1 / \ / \ / | \ 0 * or * 1 -> * * * / \ / \ * * * * 4 - node SBB - tree 1 B- tree 1 0 1 2 / \ / | | \ 0 2 -> * * * * / \ / \ * * * *
The algorithms for maintaining B - trees are confusing at best , probably because they grow up instead of down and programmers have trouble with that .
As a result , the algorithms for B - trees do n’t translate well into the symmetric binary B - tree abstraction and are still confusing .
So while it was a good idea , symmetric binary B - trees were missing something .
Later , Robert Sedgewick and Leonidas Guibas came up with a mnemonic abstraction that made symmetric binary B - trees easier to understand ( and the name was shorter too ! ) .
By giving nodes a color , you could easily differentiate between vertical and horizontal links .
Under this abstraction , nodes that are part of a logical B - tree node ( horizontal links ) are colored red , while nodes that separate logical B - tree nodes ( vertical links ) are colored black .
Thus was born the red black tree .
Here are the 2 , 3 , and 4 - nodes represented under the red black abstraction ( B = black , R = red ) :
2 - node 0 , B / \ * * 3 - node 1 , B 0 , B / \ / \ 0 , R * or * 1 , R / \ / \ * * * * 4 - node 1 , B / \ 0 , R 2 , R / \ / \ * * * *
This gives us some easy to remember rules to maintain balance .
First , a node that ’s colored red ca n’t have a child that ’s also colored red , because that does n’t fit into the abstraction .
If a node is colored red , then it ’s part of a logical node , and the only possible color for the next node is black because a red node ’s links play the part of a B - tree node ’s links to the next B - tree node .
A violation of this rule is called a red violation ( duh ! ) .
We ’re all in this together .
Just like you , we ’re closely monitoring the impact of COVID - 19 .

Next , because in a B - tree any path from the root to a leaf always has the same number of nodes , and all leaves are on the same level , the number of black nodes along any path in a red black tree must be the same .
Because a black parent and its red children are a part of the same logical node , red nodes are n’t counted along the path .
This is called the black height of a red black tree .
A violation of this rule is called a black violation .
Finally , the root of a red black tree must be black .
This makes all kinds of sense because only a black node can have red children , and the root has no parent .
However , this rule only applies when using the B - tree abstraction .
In practice the root can be either red or black and no affect the performance of a red black tree .
Let ’s see how James and Carys BUYING TOP RATED PRODUCTS
All algorithms that maintain balance in a red black tree must not violate any of these rules .
When all of the rules apply , the tree is a valid red black tree , and the height can not be any shorter than log ( N + 1 ) but also no taller than 2 * log( N + 1 ) .
This is obviously logarithmic , so a red black tree guarantees approximately the best case for a binary search tree .
Now , because red black trees are so common these days , the original abstraction has been largely forgotten in favor of a data structure that simply avoids violating two basic rules : a red node cannot have red children , and every path must have the same number of black nodes .
This fulfills the requirements of a red black tree needed to maintain the performance properties .
Note that the root need not be black under this scheme , but it does make the algorithms simpler because you can avoid the special case of a red violation at the root .
Before we start , we ’ll need to cover some of the basics and get a little framework code going .
First , the node and tree structures .
However you want to represent a node ’s color is up to you .
A common solution is an enumeration with with two constants , one for black and one for red .
I find it easier to use a flag where if the flag is set , the node is red and if the flag is not set , the node is black .
Naturally the inverse works as well , but the flag solution with red being set will be what this tutorial uses :
struct jsw_node { int red ; int data ; struct jsw_node * link [ 2 ] ; } ; struct jsw_tree { struct jsw_node * root ; } ;
I ’m sure that if this is your first time reading one of my tree tutorials that the link array could be confusing .
Instead of using two pointers called left and right , as is the usual convention , I prefer to use an array where index 0 is left and index 1 is right .
This makes it easier to merge the symmetric cases together to shorten the code and to guarantee correctness .
This is my personal idiom , and to the best of my knowledge , I ’m the only one who merges symmetric cases using it .
To minimize shock , here is the basic difference between the “ classic ” idiom and my own :
/* Classic binary search tree insertion */ struct cbt_node * cbt_insert ( struct cbt_node * root , int data ) { if ( root == NULL ) { root = make_node ( data ) ; } else if ( data < root -> data ) { root -> left = cbt_insert ( root -> left , data ) ; } else { root -> right = cbt_insert ( root -> right , data ) ; } return root ; } /* Julienne Walker 's binary search tree insertion */ struct jsw_node * jsw_insert ( struct jsw_node * root , int data ) { if ( root == NULL ) { root = make_node ( data ) ; } else { int dir = root -> data < data ; root -> link [ dir ] = jsw_insert ( root -> link [ dir ] , data ) ; } return root ; }
At this level there appears to be no savings , but if you add 50 lines of rebalancing code to both the left and right direction cases , it ’s easy to see that the classic insertion requires 100 extra lines , but my insertion only needs 50 because the two symmetric cases were merged into one .
In the actual implementation this results in dir being the direction that we ’re going and ! dir being the opposite direction .
Once you get a feel for the idiom , it ’s not terribly hard to read code that uses it .
We believe our role serving customers and the community during this time is an important one .
Here is a roundup of how we ’re addressing COVID - 19 and supporting those directly and indirectly impacted .

Back to the framework , to avoid constantly cluttering up the code with boundary tests , a little helper function that tells us if a node is red can be used .
To make life simpler , we will assume that a leaf is black , because our leaves are null pointers and trying to fix a red violation with a null pointer scares the hell out of me . 🙂
int is_red ( struct jsw_node * root ) { return root !=
NULL && root - >red == 1 ; }
Finally , the rotations .
Any tree balancing scheme will use rotations to change the structure without breaking any of the rules of binary search trees .
However , in this case it ’s cleaner to also handle recoloring of the nodes that are rotated .
A single rotation in a red black tree simply rotates the nodes as normal , then sets the old root to be red and the new root to be black .
A double rotation is just two single rotations .
This is sufficient for insertion , but deletion is harder ( what a shock ) .
Despite that , we can still benefit from the color change during rotations in the deletion algorithm , so we will place it in the code for a single rotation , and the double rotation will use it implicitly :
struct jsw_node * jsw_single ( struct jsw_node * root , int dir ) { struct jsw_node * save = root -> link [ ! dir ] ; root -> link [ ! dir ] = save -> link [ dir ] ; save -> link [ dir ] = root ; root - >red = 1 ; save - >red = 0 ; return save ; } struct jsw_node * jsw_double ( struct jsw_node * root , int dir ) { root -> link [ ! dir ] = jsw_single ( root -> link [ !dir ] , !dir ) ; return jsw_single ( root , dir ) ; }
Do n’t get so anxious , we ’re not going to look at insertion just yet .
Balanced trees are not trivial data structures , and red black trees are exceptionally tricky to get right because a small change in one part of the tree could cause a violation in a distant part of the tree .
So it makes sense to have a little tester function to make sure that no violations have occurred .
Why ?
Because it might seem like the algorithms work for small trees , but then they break on large trees and you do n’t know why .
With a tester function , we can be confident that the algorithm works , provided we slam it with enough data into a big enough tree ( too large of a case to test by hand ) .
Since the tester would only be used for debugging , we can use recursion and expect it to be slow , which it is :
int jsw_rb_assert ( struct jsw_node * root ) { int lh , rh ; if ( root == NULL ) { return 1 ; } else { struct jsw_node * ln = root -> link [ 0 ] ; struct jsw_node * rn = root -> link [ 1 ] ; /* Consecutive red links */ if ( is_red ( root ) ) { if ( is_red ( ln ) || is_red ( rn ) ) { puts ( " Red violation " ) ; return 0 ; } } lh = jsw_rb_assert ( ln ) ; rh = jsw_rb_assert ( rn ) ; /* Invalid binary search tree */ if ( ( ln != NULL && ln->data >= root -> data ) || ( rn != NULL && rn ->data <= root -> data ) ) { puts ( " Binary tree violation " ) ; return 0 ; } /* Black height mismatch */ if ( lh != 0 && rh != 0 && lh != rh ) { puts ( " Black violation " ) ; return 0 ; } /*
Only count black links */ if ( lh != 0 && rh != 0 ) { return is_red ( root ) ?
lh : lh + 1 ; } else { return 0 ; } } }
This algorithm is relatively simple .
It walks over every node in the tree and performs certain tests on the node and its children .
The first test is to see if a red node has red children .
The second test makes sure that the tree is a valid binary search tree .
The last test counts the black nodes along a path and ensures that all paths have the same black height .
If jsw_rb_assert returns 0 , the tree is an invalid red black tree .
Otherwise it will return the black height of the entire tree .
For convenience , a message will also print out telling you which violations occurred . 🙂
Now we ’re ready to move on to insertion !
So roll up your sleeves and get ready to mess about in the muck .
Bottom - up Insertion
When we want to insert into a red black tree , we immediately have a decision .
Do we color a new node red or black ?
What kind of algorithm we write depends on this decision because of the violations that it could introduce .
If the new node is black then inserting it into the tree always introduces a black violation .
The rest of the algorithm would then need to concentrate on fixing the black violation without introducing a red violation .
On the other hand , if the new node is red , there is a chance that it could introduce a red violation .
The rest of the algorithm would then need to work toward fixing the red violation without introducing a black violation .
But wait !
If the new node is red , and it ’s inserted as the child of a black node then no violations occur at all , whereas if the new node is black , a black violation always occurs .
So the logical choice is to color the new node red because there is a possibility that insertion wo n’t violate the rules at all .
The same ca n’t be said of inserting a black node .
Red violations are also more localized and thus , easier to fix .
Therefore , we will give new nodes the color red , and fix red violations during insertion .
Laziness wins !
How about a helper function that returns a new red node ?
struct jsw_node * make_node ( int data ) { struct jsw_node * rn = malloc ( sizeof * rn ) ; if ( rn != NULL ) { rn->data = data ; rn->red = 1 ; /* 1 is red , 0 is black */ rn->link [ 0 ] = NULL ; rn->link [ 1 ] = NULL ; } return rn ; }
Ah , finally .
Insertion .
Adding a node .
Instead of just talking big about red black trees , we can play with the real thing now .
Okay , let ’s insert a node into a basic binary search tree , that ’s the first order of business .
Then we can walk back up and rebalance if there ’s a red violation .
For simplicity ( hah ! ) we ’ll use recursion to insert a new node and deny duplicates .
Do n’t forget to notice the last bit of code to make the root black .
That ’s important because it ensures the last red black tree rule and saves us from dealing with a red violation at the root .
The code should be obvious , and if it is n’t , you ’re in the wrong tutorial .
Try Binary Search
Trees I , third door to the left :
struct jsw_node * jsw_insert_r( struct jsw_node * root , int data ) { if ( root == NULL ) { root = make_node ( data ) ; } else if ( data != root -> data ) { int dir = root -> data < data ; root -> link [ dir ] = jsw_insert_r( root -> link [ dir ] , data ) ; /*
Hey , let 's rebalance here ! */ } return root ; } int jsw_insert ( struct jsw_tree * tree , int data ) { tree -> root = jsw_insert_r ( tree -> root , data ) ; tree -> root - >red = 0 ; return 1 ; }
This is about as simple as it gets for a binary search tree , but since we know that we might need to rebalance back up the tree , naturally the code to rebalance would go after the recursive call .
Remember those programming classes where you had to print numbers in reverse using recursion ?
The same principle applies here .
We recurse down , down , down ( down ! sit! stay ! ) , then insert a new node at the first leaf we get to ( because the second leaf we get to would probably seg fault ) .
Then the recursion rewinds on its own and we can take advantage of that .
So how do we test for a red violation ?
Simple , if any child on the path is red , test its children to see if one or the other is red .
If so , fix the violation .
Note that only one child will be red , otherwise something else is broken with the tree because a red violation would had to have already been present and the tree would already have been an invalid red black tree .
But we ’ll assume that it ’s valid , because that ’s easier .
Okay , okay , but how do we FIX a red violation ?
That ’s equally simple !
There are only three cases , and all of them are as easy as falling down .
In the first case , we check both children of the node ( remember that we do n’t do this for the new node ) .
If both children are red then the parent has to be black , so we can just flip the colors .
The parent becomes red and the children become black :
2 ,B 2 , R / \ / \ 1 , R 3, R -> 1 , B 3 , B / / 0,R 0 ,
R
Okay , that takes care of the immediate problem , but if the parent ’s color changes then we risk a violation further up the tree .
This is important , if the children of a node do n’t change color and the parent of a node does n’t change color , there ’s no way a red violation could propagate .
So if 2 remained black in the above diagram , we could terminate .
But since it changed from black to red , it ’s possible that its parent could also be red and there ’s another violation .
So after this case we move up and look suspiciously around for problems .
The second case is if the node ’s ( 1 in this case ) sibling ( 3 in this case ) is not red .
If so , the color flip trick wo n’t work because that would increase the black height of the paths down to the right of 2 .
So we need to do more work , and that screams rotation .
In the second case , 1 ’s left child caused the violation , so we single rotate around 2 to the right , make 2 red , make 1 black , and call it a day :
2 ,B 1 , B / \ / \ 1 , R 3 , B -> 0 , R 2 , R / \ 0,R 3 , B
This fixes the red violation , the subtree ’s root does n’t change color , so we can be sure that the red violation wo n’t propagate upward .
But it gets better !
This rotation does n’t change the black height of either subtree , so the tree is now balanced and we ’re done with all rotations !
But why does the black height not change ?
Notice that in the “ before ” diagram , the black height of 2 ’s left subtree is 1 ( including 2 itself ) and the black height of 2 ’s right subtree is 2 .
Now look at the “ after ” diagram .
The left subtree ’s black height is still 1 and the right subtree ’s black height is still 2 !
Do n’t forget to ignore red nodes in the black height , they do n’t count .
Yes , good catch , that tree is not a valid red black tree .
Why ?
Because the black heights are not the same .
What we have here is a black violation !
Durnit !
But the good news is that this will never happen .
The example was contrived to show you how the rotation works without having to draw a large tree , but that exact tree will never occur in the wild .
Why ?
Because there was a black violation before 0 was inserted !
In fact , the first rotation in a red black tree of ascending numbers would only be after the seventh number .
Let ’s look at that case after 7 is inserted :
1 ,B / \ 0 , B 3 , R / \ 2 , B 5 , B / \ 4 , R 6 , R \ 7 , R
At this point a color flip will be made because 5 , 4 , and 6 meet the first case .
A color flip could cause a red violation higher up , so we move up to 3 and see that it actually did cause a red violation at 3 , and now the single rotation case applies .
Let ’s look at the tree before the rotation is made :
1 ,B / \ 0 , B 3 , R / \ 2 , B 5 , R / \ 4 , B 6 , B \ 7 ,
R
The most important thing to notice right now is that there is NO black violation !
Every path has two black nodes , so the only violation is the red violation at 3 .
When we rotate at 1 , 3 becomes the new black root , and 1 becomes red .
The resulting tree is as follows .
Notice that there are no red violations , and all black heights are the same .
So the single rotation case works :
3 ,B / \ 1 , R 5 , R / \ / \ 0 , B 2 , B 4 , B 6 , B \ 7 ,
R
It ’s pretty easy to see now why jsw_single sets colors the way it does .
The final case is if instead of the left child being red , the right child is red .
Well , if the right child is red then a single rotation wo n’t cut it .
This is where a double rotation is needed :
2 ,B 2 , B 1 , B / \ / \ / \ 0 , R 3 , B -> 1 , B 3, B -> 0 , R 2 , R \ / \ 1 , R 0,R 3 , B
Wait , wait , wait !
The intermediate step is valid , right ?
So why do n’t we just do a single rotation ?
Well , once again this is a contrived example that wo n’t exist in the wild as drawn .
Notice that the first rotation increases the black height of 3 ’s left subtree .
That could introduce a black violation , so we continue the double rotation to avoid that case .
See if you can find a valid red black tree where this case would exist and make sure that it actually works like we did above .
In the meantime , we ’ll be here moving along without you .
But do n’t worry , it ’s not like the tutorial will start to disappear if you stop along the way to work the exercises . 🙂
The three cases have been looked at , now let ’s fill in that comment with the code to test for and fix all three cases .
Remember that the new node is never rebalanced ; the algorithm just returns the new node when it reaches a leaf and leaves rebalancing up to the nodes above .
We make sure that if there ’s a violation , it ’s in the subtree .
That way we can pull of the rotations without setting a status flag that reminds the algorithm to rotate further up .
In fact , no status flag is needed at all !
It ’s possible that we could do color flips all the way back up the tree even though only one single or double rotation might be made :
struct jsw_node * jsw_insert_r( struct jsw_node * root , int data ) { if ( root == NULL ) { root = make_node ( data ) ; } else if ( data != root -> data ) { int dir = root -> data < data ; root -> link [ dir ] = jsw_insert_r( root -> link [ dir ] , data ) ; if ( is_red ( root - > link [ dir ] ) ) { if ( is_red ( root -> link [ ! dir ] ) ) { /* Case 1 */ root - >red = 1 ; root -> link [ 0 ] ->red = 0 ; root -> link [ 1 ] ->red = 0 ; } else { /* Cases 2 & 3 */ if ( is_red ( root -> link [ dir ] -> link [ dir ] ) ) { root = jsw_single ( root , ! dir ) ; } else if ( is_red ( root -> link [ dir ] -> link [ ! dir ] ) ) { root = jsw_double ( root , !dir ) ; } } } } return root ; } int jsw_insert ( struct jsw_tree * tree , int data ) { tree -> root = jsw_insert_r ( tree -> root , data ) ; tree -> root - >red = 0 ; return 1 ; }
Okay , that was anticlimactic .
Simple , elegant , that ’s red black insertion from the bottom - up !
I recommend you go through an example that covers all of the cases , just to make sure that it works .
Yes , we have the test function , but how do you know I ’m not just messing with you ?
Well , you ’ll know after you grab about 30 random numbers and do your own execution trace !
Insertion really is the easiest part of red black trees .
A red violation is sickly simple to test for and fix without causing problems elsewhere .
The big problems come when you try to remove a node from a red black tree .
The next section will describe bottom - up deletion .
Get ready for a good time !
Bottom - up Deletion
Deletion of a node from a red black tree is a pain in the ass .
That ’s my official opinion too .
I hate it and you ’ll learn to hate it .
Especially the bottom - up algorithm .
Especially the first way I ’m going to describe it to you .
>:-)
During insertion we had the option of selecting the color of a new node to make our lives easier .
We forced a red violation and fixed it .
Red violations are easy to fix , and we took full advantage of that to produce a truly elegant recursive algorithm .
When you want to delete a node , you do n’t have the option of choosing its color .
If it ’s red , that ’s great !
Red nodes can be removed without any violations .
Why ?
Well , I ca n’t think of a way to introduce a red violation by removing a red node from a valid tree , but you ’re welcome to look for one .
Since a red node does n’t participate in the black height , removing a red node has no effect on the black height .
Therefore , removing a red node cannot violate the rules of a red black tree .
If the node is black , that ’s a problem .
Removing a black node is sure to cause a black violation just like inserting a black node , which is why we avoided that during insertion , and it could very likely cause a red violation too !
Ouch .
Well , let ’s remove the node first , then think about how to fix violations .
The following is a simple recursive deletion from a red black tree .
If the node to be deleted has less than two children , we just replace it with it ’s non-null child , or a null pointer if there are no children .
Conveniently enough , we might be able to get away without rebalancing at this point .
If the node that we ’re going to delete is black and has one red child , we can color the child black and introduce no violations because we ’ve reduced the case of removing a black node to the case of removing a red node , which is guaranteed to cause no violations .
We ’ll call this case 0 .
If the node has two children , we find its inorder predecessor and copy the predecessor ’s data into the node .
Then we recursively delete the predecessor , since it ’s guaranteed to have at most one child .
All in all , the algorithm is very pretty , even with the extra framework added to facilitate rebalancing ( the simple recoloring after deletion , the status flag , and the mysterious jsw_remove_balance ) .
Notice that the root is colored black at the end only if the tree is not empty :
struct jsw_node * jsw_remove_r( struct jsw_node * root , int data , int * done ) { if ( root == NULL ) { * done = 1 ; } else { int dir ; if ( root - > data == data ) { if ( root - > link [ 0 ] == NULL || root -> link [ 1 ] == NULL ) { struct jsw_node * save = root -> link[ root -> link [ 0 ] == NULL ] ; /* Case 0 */ if ( is_red ( root ) ) { * done = 1 ; } else if ( is_red ( save ) ) { save - >red = 0 ; * done = 1 ; } free ( root ) ; return save ; } else { struct jsw_node * heir = root -> link [ 0 ] ; while ( heir - > link [ 1 ] != NULL ) { heir = heir -> link [ 1 ] ; } root -> data = heir -> data ; data = heir -> data ; } } dir = root -> data < data ; root -> link [ dir ] = jsw_remove_r( root -> link [ dir ] , data , done ) ; if ( !* done ) { root = jsw_remove_balance ( root , dir , done ) ; } } return root ; } int jsw_remove ( struct jsw_tree * tree , int data ) { int done = 0 ; tree -> root = jsw_remove_r( tree -> root , data , &done ) ; if ( tree -> root != NULL ) { tree -> root - >red = 0 ; } return 1 ; }
This time we really do need a status flag to tell the algorithm when to stop rebalancing .
If jsw_remove_balance is called all of the way up the tree , it could get ugly .
Since this function only removes external nodes ( nodes without two children ) , we only have to worry about setting the flag after a removal ( if the node is red or case 0 applies ) , and inside jsw_remove_balance .
It ’s obvious that the real work is done by jsw_remove_balance , but what does this helper function do ?
It handles all of the cases that could pop up after removing a black node , of course !
And it ’s about as long as jsw_remove_r . 🙁
Let ’s look at the simple cases first .
If we remove a node , and the node ’s sibling is black , and its children are both black , we have an easy case that propagates (* = the place we deleted ) :
3 , B 3 , B / \ / \ 1 , B * -> 1 , R * / \ / \ 0 , B 2 , B 0,B 2 , B
In this case , we can simply recolor 1 ( the sibling ) to be red without introducing a red violation , but the possibility still exists that there ’s a black violation because we decreased the black height of 3 ’s left subtree .
This causes both of 3 ’s subtrees to be the same black height , but if 3 itself is a subtree , then its parent will see a black violation since the sibling subtree has n’t decreased in black height .
However , if the parent node ( 3 in this case ) was originally red , we can recolor the sibling red , the parent black , and we ’re done because the black heights are now balanced all of the way up the tree .
We can set the flag for this one :
3 , R 3 , B / \ / \ 1 , B * -> 1 , R * / \ / \ 0 , B 2 , B 0,B 2 , B
Now for the harder cases where the sibling is black and either or both of its children are red .
There are two cases here .
If the left child of the sibling is red then we only need to perform a single rotation .
However , the parent could be either red or black , so we need to save its color and restore it later , because a rotation does n’t consider the old colors of the new parent and old parent .
After the rotation , the new parent is recolored with the old parent ’s color and its children become black ( E = either color ) :
3 ,E 1 , E / \ / \ 1 , B * -> 0 , B 3 , B / \ / \ 0 , R 2 , E 2, E *
This restores the black height of the subtree , and the status flag can be set to signal that no more rebalancing is needed .
The same process is followed if the sibling ’s right child is red , except this time we use a double rotation instead of a single rotation .
The final colors are identical , and keep in mind that the sibling ’s left child would have to be black in this case .
If it ’s red then the previous case applies :
3 ,E 2 , E / \ / \ 1 , B * -> 1 , B 3 , B / \ / \ 0 , B 2 , R 0 , B *
Whew , what a workout !
But I have bad news for you .
Those are only the cases where the sibling is black .
If the sibling is red , it ’s even worse .
But I have good news for you too .
The following discussion does n’t matter except as an intellectual curiosity .
We ’ll completely avoid the red sibling case shortly .
So take a deep breath and get ready for the second half of rebalancing cases for deletion .
All set ?
Okay , every case for a red sibling requires at least one rotation , but no more than three .
But first , the simple cases .
If the sibling is red then both of its children are black , so we can do a single rotation , recolor the new parent black , and recolor the sibling ’s right child red to restore balance .
Remember that the cases are symmetric , even though the descriptions and diagrams only consider deleting from the right subtree , but by using the direction index trick , we only need to handle one of the symmetric cases ( where dir would be 1 ) .
All of this should become clear when you see the code :
3 ,B 1 , B / \ / \ 1 , R * -> 0 , B 3 , B / \ / \ 0 , B 2 , B 2, R *
It ’s obvious after seeing a diagram how this restores balance by fixing the black heights , but it ’s confusing why 2 becomes red .
Well , the red has to go somewhere or the black height of the tree would be affected , and the only known node that we are sure can be made red is that particular child .
I do n’t quite remember how I figured out the red sibling cases , but I ’m reasonably sure that alcohol was involved . 🙂
The second red sibling case looks at the inner child of the sibling .
This child cannot be a null pointer ( exercise : why ? ) , so we simply test one of its children and act depending on which one is red .
If the outer child is red , we perform a double rotation , color the new parent black , its right child black , and its left child red :
3 ,B 2 , B / \ / \ 0 , R * -> 0 , R 3 , B \ \ \ 2 , B 1 , B * / 1 , R
This restores the black height of the right subtree without changing the black height of the left subtree .
When we have two red nodes to work with , it ’s easy to make one of them black after the rotation and leave the other to avoid violating the black height of the subtree that we took it from .
The last case is if 3 ’s right child is red .
The good news is that we can reduce this to the previous case by a single rotation at 2 , then a double rotation at 5 ( the previous case ) will give us the structure we want , with the same colors as above .
3 , B 3 , B 2 , B / \ / \ / \ 0 , R * -> 0 , R * -> 0 , R 3 , B \ \ \ \ 1 , B 2 , B 1 , B * \ / 2, R 1 , R
Before you start thinking of the terrible mess that jsw_remove_balance must be , let ’s look at it and see that it really is n’t that bad .
Yes , it ’s long , but none of the cases are overly difficult .
The real savings come from noticing similarities between cases and setting colors outside of the cases so as to avoid repeating code , but we can do much better as you ’ll see shortly .
Compare the cases described above with their translations into source code .
Did we cover all of the cases ?
struct jsw_node * jsw_remove_balance ( struct jsw_node * root , int dir , int * done ) { struct jsw_node *p = root ; struct jsw_node *s = root -> link [ ! dir ] ; if ( s != NULL && !is_red(s ) ) { /*
Black sibling cases */ if ( ! is_red (s -> link [ 0 ] ) && !is_red (s -> link [ 1 ] ) ) { if ( is_red ( p ) ) { * done = 1 ; } p->red = 0 ; s->red = 1 ; } else { int save = root - >red ; if ( is_red(s - > link [ ! dir ] ) ) { p = jsw_single ( p , dir ) ; } else { p = jsw_double ( p , dir ) ; } p->red = save ; p -> link [ 0 ] - >red = 0 ; p -> link [ 1 ] ->red = 0 ; * done = 1 ; } } else if ( s -> link [ dir ] != NULL ) { /*
Red sibling cases */ struct jsw_node *r = s -> link [ dir ] ; if ( ! is_red ( r -> link [ 0 ] ) && !is_red ( r -> link [ 1 ] ) ) { p = jsw_single ( p , dir ) ; p -> link [ dir ] -> link [ ! dir ] ->red = 1 ; } else { if ( is_red ( r - > link [ dir ] ) ) { s-> link [ dir ] = jsw_single(r , ! dir ) ; } p = jsw_double ( p , dir ) ; s-> link [ dir ] ->red = 0 ; p-> link [ ! dir ] ->red = 1 ; } p->red = 0 ; p -> link [ dir ] ->red = 0 ; * done = 1 ; } return p ; }
Traditionally , red black trees reduce the red sibling case to a black sibling case .
Unless you ’re familiar with the red sibling case ( which is why I showed it to you ) , the reasons behind this case reduction would be terribly confusing .
But , because the sibling ’s parent and children have to be black , a single rotation will push the parent down on the side that we deleted , recolor it red , pull the sibling and its children up , and recolor the sibling black .
This does n’t change the black height of the tree , it just reverses which side the violation is on .
By pushing the entire violation down , we ensure that the new sibling ( 2 in this case ) is black :
3 ,B 1 , B / \ / \ 1 , R * -> 0 , B 3 , R / \ / \ 0 , B 2 , B 2, B *
This is where it gets tricky because we need to reverse direction twice .
At this point we ’re riding the wave of recursion up the tree , but to reduce the red sibling case , we need to move down along with the sibling .
So * would still be the place we removed a node , but 2 would be the new sibling .
The cases after this are identical , but this time we need to be careful to move down without losing anything so that we can move back up without any trouble :
struct jsw_node * jsw_remove_balance ( struct jsw_node * root , int dir , int * done ) { struct jsw_node *p = root ; struct jsw_node *s = root -> link [ ! dir ] ; /*
Case reduction , remove red sibling */ if ( is_red (s ) ) { root = jsw_single ( root , dir ) ; s = p -> link [ ! dir ] ; } if ( s != NULL ) { if ( ! is_red (s -> link [ 0 ] ) && !is_red (s -> link [ 1 ] ) ) { if ( is_red ( p ) ) { * done = 1 ; } p->red = 0 ; s->red = 1 ; } else { int save = p->red ; int new_root = ( root == p ) ; if ( is_red(s - > link [ ! dir ] ) ) { p = jsw_single ( p , dir ) ; } else { p = jsw_double ( p , dir ) ; } p->red = save ; p -> link [ 0 ] - >red = 0 ; p -> link [ 1 ] ->red = 0 ; if ( new_root ) { root = p ; } else { root -> link [ dir ] = p ; } * done = 1 ; } } return root ; }
The subtle waltz of root and p could be confusing , but the only fix for that is an execution trace to make sure that you understand why root is used where it is and why p is used where it is .
Remember that I said the case reduction was confusing ( probably why nobody cares to explain it ) , but it simplifies the code greatly by removing half of the rebalancing work that we need to do .
Top -down Insertion
One of the primary benefits of red black trees is that both the insertion and deletion algorithms can be written in one top - down pass , instead of an algorithm that walks down using recursion , parent pointers , or an explicit stack so that it can walk back up to rebalance .
Bottom - up algorithms feel inelegant because they often ignore useful work on the way down or on the way back up .
If we make sure that all color changes and rotations are made on the way down then we do n’t need to go back up and rebalance .
This means that we do n’t need to use recursion any longer , or any other tricks that make the algorithms confusing .
So let ’s look at a non-recursive top - down insertion .
One key concept that you need to take away from this tutorial is that the rules are the same , regardless of how you implement them .
So there are still three cases for red black insertion : color flip , single rotation , and double rotation .
Everything else is framework and details .
However , for top - down insertion we do n’t have the benefit of riding the recursion wave .
To recover from that deficiency we need to carefully save several pointers back up the tree .
At the very least we have the current node along the path ( which will be a null pointer at the end ) , its parent , and the parent ’s parent .
To avoid special cases , we ’ll also use a dummy tree root , where the actual root is the dummy ’s right link .
This way we do n’t have to constantly test the special boundary case of rebalancing at the root .
To make rotations simpler , we ’ll also add a pointer for the parent of the grandparent .
So at the most we ’re saving the last three levels of the path .
For the color flip case , we test the current node ’s children .
If they ’re red then the current node must be black , so we do a color flip .
This could cause a red violation further up the tree ( which is why we saved the parent of the current node ) .
Now , because a color flip could immediately cause a violation , we go straight to the violation test between the parent and the current node .
If both are red , we do a single or double rotation at the grandparent :
Color Flip 1 , E <-- p 1 , E \ \ 3 , B <-- q becomes 3 , R / \ / \ 2 , R 4 , R 2 , B 4 , B Single Rotation 0 , B <-- g 1 , B \ / \ 1 , R <-- p 0 , R 3 , R \ becomes / \ 3 , R <-- q 2 , B 4 , B / \ 2 , B 4 , B Double Rotation 0 , B <-- g 2 , B \ / \ 4 , R <-- p 0 , R 4 , R / becomes \ / 2 , R <-- q 1 , B 3 , B / \ 1 ,B 3 , B
Notice how a rotation is made around the grandparent , which is why we also save a pointer to the grandparent ’s parent .
Otherwise it would be rather difficult to notify the tree of the changes we ’re making .
The code to perform this magic is shorter than you would expect , but it does n’t follow conventional methods .
All of the work is done in the walk down loop , including insertion , since inserting a new red node could cause a violation .
So the loop breaks when the data is found either because a new node was inserted or because there was already a node with that data in the tree .
As such , the following algorithm does not allow duplicates and also does not warn about a duplicate :
int jsw_insert ( struct jsw_tree * tree , int data ) { if ( tree - > root == NULL ) { /*
Empty tree case */ tree -> root = make_node ( data ) ; if ( tree - > root == NULL ) { return 0 ; } } else { struct jsw_node head = { 0 } ; /*
False tree root */ struct jsw_node *g , *t ; /* Grandparent & parent */ struct jsw_node *p , *q ; /* Iterator & parent */ int dir = 0 , last ; /*
Set up helpers */ t = &head ; g = p = NULL ; q = t-> link [ 1 ] = tree ->root ; /* Search down the tree */ for ( ; ; ) { if ( q == NULL ) { /*
Insert new node at the bottom */ p -> link [ dir ] = q = make_node ( data ) ; if ( q == NULL ) { return 0 ; } } else if ( is_red ( q - > link [ 0 ] ) && is_red(q -> link [ 1 ] ) ) { /* Color flip */ q->red = 1 ; q-> link [ 0 ] ->red = 0 ; q-> link [ 1 ] ->red = 0 ; } /*
Fix red violation */ if ( is_red ( q ) && is_red ( p ) ) { int dir2 = t -> link [ 1 ] == g ; if ( q == p -> link [ last ] ) { t-> link[ dir2 ] = jsw_single(g , !last ) ; } else { t-> link[ dir2 ] = jsw_double(g , !last ) ; } } /* Stop if found */ if ( q - > data == data ) { break ; } last = dir ; dir = q->data < data ; /*
Update helpers */ if ( g != NULL ) { t = g ; } g = p , p = q ; q = q -> link [ dir ] ; } /* Update root */ tree -> root = head .
link [ 1 ] ; } /*
Make root black */ tree -> root - >red = 0 ; return 1 ; }
Granted , this top - down insertion is n’t as pretty as the recursive bottom - up insertion , but it takes full advantage of the properties of red black trees , and avoids the potential problems of recursion .
It ’s also theoretically more efficient . 🙂
The good news is that deletion is easier top - down than bottom - up , and we can use the lessons gained from insertion to make implementing it easier .
Let ’s take a look .
Top -down Deletion
Bottom - up deletion was a pain because we needed to recover from a black violation , which is the harder of the two violations to fix .
However , the deletion was trivial if we removed a red node because deleting a red node can’t violate any of the rules of a red black tree .
If we could somehow guarantee that the node to be deleted was red , it would simplify deletion greatly .
The good news is that we can do just that !
By forcing a red node into the tree at the top and pushing it down using color flips and rotations , we can ensure that a red node will be deleted , always .
There are only four cases for pushing a red node down the tree without a black violation .
The first case is a simple reverse color flip .
If a node and it ’s sibling are black , and all four of their children are black , make the parent black and both children red :
1 , R 1 , B / \ -> / \ 0 , B 2 , B 0,R 2 , R
This is basically a reverse color flip from what we did during insertion .
It pushes the red nodes down rather than forcing them up , all without changing the black height of the tree .
Cool . 🙂
The next case is the dreaded red sibling case , which we will quickly reduce to nothing with a single rotation , using the tricks we learned from bottom - up deletion .
This case is very intuitive now that we do n’t have to change directions to get it to work .
Notice how the black heights do n’t change , nor does the color of the parent .
Since we ’re moving down already , pushing the sibling down is just what the doctor ordered :
1 ,B 0 , B / \ \ 0 , R 2, B -> 1 , R \ 2 , B
The final two cases are , you guessed it , single and double rotations depending on the color of the sibling ’s children .
The cases are ( should be ! ) familiar by now , so we ’ll just go over them briefly before looking at the code .
If the right child is red , we perform a double rotation .
However , in this case the color changes of jsw_single wo n’t quite cut it .
To be thorough , we ’ll force the correct coloring for all affected nodes :
2,R 1 , R / \ / \ 0 , B 3, B -> 0 , B 2 , B \ \ 1,R 3 , R
As always , we have to make sure that the color of the parent does n’t change and the black heights of both subtrees remain the same as they were originally .
These two guidelines avoid both red and black violations .
If the left child of the sibling is red then a single rotation is more than enough to do the same thing .
Since the final colors are the same , so the recoloring of this case can be lumped together with the previous case :
2,R 1 , R / \ / \ 1 , B 3, B -> 0 , B 2 , B / \ 0,R 3 , R
Now for the fun part .
This algorithm will use a sneaky deletion by copying technique that saves the node to be deleted , and just keeps on going through the loop until the inorder predecessor is found .
At that point the walk down loop terminates , the data items are copied and the external node is spliced out of the tree .
This is as opposed to a naive deletion by copying that breaks the search off when the node is found , then has an extra step that explicitly looks for the predecessor .
On the way down , of course , we look for and handle the cases shown above :
int jsw_remove ( struct jsw_tree * tree , int data ) { if ( tree -> root != NULL ) { struct jsw_node head = { 0 } ; /*
False tree root */ struct jsw_node *q , *p , * g ; /* Helpers */ struct jsw_node *f = NULL ; /* Found item */ int dir =
1 ; /* Set up helpers */ q = &head ; g = p = NULL ; q -> link [ 1 ] = tree ->root ; /* Search and push a red down */ while ( q - > link [ dir ] != NULL ) { int last = dir ; /* Update helpers */ g = p , p = q ; q = q -> link [ dir ] ; dir = q->data < data ; /*
Save found node */ if ( q - > data == data ) { f = q ; } /*
Push the red node down */ if ( !is_red ( q ) && !is_red ( q -> link [ dir ] ) ) { if ( is_red( q - > link [ ! dir ] ) ) { p = p-> link [ last ] = jsw_single( q , dir ) ; } else if ( !is_red(q -> link [ !dir ] ) ) { struct jsw_node *s = p-> link [ !last ] ; if ( s != NULL ) { if ( !is_red(s -> link [ !last ] ) && !is_red(s-> link [ last ] ) ) { /*
Color flip */ p->red = 0 ; s->red = 1 ; q ->red = 1 ; } else { int dir2 = g -> link [ 1 ] == p ; if ( is_red (s - > link [ last ] ) ) { g-> link [ dir2 ] = jsw_double ( p , last ) ; } else if ( is_red(s - > link [ ! last ] ) ) { g-> link [ dir2 ] = jsw_single ( p , last ) ; } /* Ensure correct coloring */ q->red = g-> link[dir2 ]->red = 1 ; g-> link[dir2 ]-> link [ 0 ] ->red = 0 ; g-> link[ dir2 ] -> link [ 1 ] ->red = 0 ; } } } } } /*
Replace and remove if found */ if ( f != NULL ) { f-> data = q->data ; p -> link [p-> link [ 1 ] == q ] = q -> link [ q -> link [ 0 ] == NULL ] ; free( q ) ; } /* Update root and make it black */ tree -> root = head .
link [ 1 ] ; if ( tree -> root != NULL ) { tree -> root - >red = 0 ; } } return 1 ; }
It ’s short and sweet , though the extreme level of indention is a little distasteful for some .
As an exercise , try to shrink that down . 🙂
As with insertion we used a dummy root to avoid special cases , and a few helper variables to point up the tree .
The majority of the complexity comes from our rebalancing cases , and if you remove them , you ’ll discover a very clean deletion algorithm for a basic binary search tree .
Be sure to trace the execution of this function to make sure that you understand how it works , because it ’s a very nifty algorithm .
Though I ’m a little biased because I ’ve never seen it used elsewhere , which means I may be the first to discover it . 🙂
That ’s top - down deletion , and it can be compared to bottom - up deletion in the same ways as insertion , but now we can also consider that the top - down code is shorter and ( I think ) simpler .
Red black trees are generally cleaner and easier to understand if written in a top - down manner , but unfortunately , due to the fact that the only well known resource that gives code for deletion is CLR , the most common implementations are still bottom - up .
Oh well .
Conclusion
Red black trees are interesting beasts .
They ’re believed to be simpler than AVL trees ( their direct competitor ) , and at first glance this seems to be the case because insertion is a breeze .
However , when one begins to play with the deletion algorithm , red black trees become very tricky .
However , the counterweight to this added complexity is that both insertion and deletion can be implemented using a single pass , top - down algorithm .
Such is not the case with AVL trees , where only the insertion algorithm can be written top - down .
Deletion from an AVL tree requires a bottom - up algorithm .
So when do you use a red black tree ?
That ’s really your decision , but I ’ve found that red black trees are best suited to largely random data that has occasional degenerate runs , and searches have no locality of reference .
This takes full advantage of the minimal work that red black trees perform to maintain balance compared to AVL trees and still allows for speedy searches .
Red black trees are popular , as most data structures with a whimsical name .
For example , in Java and C++ , the library map structures are typically implemented with a red black tree .
Red black trees are also comparable in speed to AVL trees .
While the balance is not quite as good , the work it takes to maintain balance is usually better in a red black tree .
There are a few misconceptions floating around , but for the most part the hype about red black trees is accurate .
This tutorial described the red black abstraction for balancing binary search trees .
Both insertion and deletion were covered in their top - down and bottom - up forms , and a full implementation for each form was given .

Obama picked up another superdelegate , this time in a critical swing state .
Today Sen. Jeff Bingaman ( D - NM ) announced his endorsement of Barack Obama .
Bingaman said , “ Our nation faces a daunting number of critical challenges : reasserting America ’s leadership in the world , meeting our needs for energy independence , addressing global warming , making healthcare accessible and affordable , positioning our economy to effectively compete globally , and extricating ourselves from the war in Iraq , to name a few . ”
The New Mexico Senator continued , “ To make progress , we must rise above the partisanship and the issues that divide us to find common ground .
We must move the country in a dramatically new direction .
I strongly believe Barack Obama is best positioned to lead the nation in that new direction . ”

Obama thanked Bingaman for his support , and praised his work on environmental and energy policy , “ I ’m grateful today to have Senator Bingaman ’s support .
Senator Bingaman has been speaking out in the United States Senate on some of the most pressing issues of our time – saving our environment , fighting global warming , and making America energy independent .
Senator Bingaman has been an important advocate in the energy debate , and has served the people of New Mexico for decades , giving voice to the issues that matter to families across the state .
We are proud to have his support as we fight to bring about real change for families in New Mexico and across the country . ”
Bingaman is n’t a high profile senator , in fact he is the longest serving junior senator , but he has been a strong advocate for a new energy policy , cutting subsidies to big oil , and he has been a real leader and shaper of the Democratic Senate ’s environmental positions .
Not only is he a popular senator in a swing state , but he is someone whose support Obama will find valuable in the fall against John McCain .

Uber -geek [ James McLurkin ] was in Austin recently demoing his robot swarm .
He ’s on tour with EDA Tech Forum .
[ McLurkin ] has multiple degrees from the MIT AI lab and worked at iRobot for a couple of years .
Lately , he has been working on distributed robot computing : robot swarms .
[ McLurkin ] was an entertaining speaker and had an interesting view of robotics .
He is optimistic that robot parts will become more modular , so it will be easier to build them , and more importantly , faster to design them .
Some quotes :
“ There ’s more sensors in a cockroach ’s butt than any robot ”
“ 12 engineer years to design , 45 minutes to build ”
“ If it can break your ankle , it ’s a real [ rc ] car . ”
His swarm ( pictured above ) is made up of over a hundred small identical bots , but he only brought about a dozen with him .
The demo was still quite impressive .
He had the robots spread out , clump together , play follow the leader and circle the wagons .
Each behavior had a very simple rule behind it .
To spread out , for example , each robot tries to move away from it ’s nearest neighbor .
The really fun part was when he had the robots perform a physical bubble sort .
The rule for this was that each bot tried to put a higher - id bot on one side and a lower - id bot on the other .
After a minute or so of bumping around the bots all lined up in id order .
I was interested in the details of the robot itself .
Here ’s a picture with the parts labeled .
Each robot has a unique ID number .
They communicate with each other via IR and have sensors so that they can tell which direction and how far away the other bots are .
The lights on top are just indicators so you can tell what the bots are doing .
A mesh network is rebuilt several times a second , creating a directed graph from the ‘ leader ’ ( which can be any arbitrary bot ) that connects to each bot in the swarm .
Any bot can act as a repeater , relaying instructions to bots that ca n’t talk to the leader directly .
Robot swarms are not a new idea : they ’ve been floating around as concepts for many years .
However , [ McLurkin ] was one of the first to actually build and program a large swarm ( at one time he held the record for the largest robot swarm in the world ) .
The idea caught on with researchers and today there ’s even an open source robot swarm project .
If you ’re not up to building a whole bunch of robots , there are also simulators .
After the demo , we asked [ McLurkin ] about the cost of the robots .
He said he did n’t know for sure , but estimated at least $ 2000 per bot .
When we commented that “ that ’s a lot of money for 100 bots ” , he pointed out that compared to the $ 20 K + that research robots can go for , it ’s a bargain .
He also said “ This whole new world of hobby robotics just did n’t exist in the 90’s ” .
For robots to be deployed in swarms of hundreds or even thousands , in situations where they can get damaged or lost ( search and rescue , military exercises ) the cost will need to drop dramatically .
Here he is packing up his robot swarm .
After the demo , we half expected them to pack themselves – no , they do n’t .
For more info on robot swarms , their inspiration and possible uses take a look at [ McLurkin ] ’s web site .
AT&T's vice president of legislative affairs Jim Cicconi recently told a UK audience that the rising volume of digital video content on the Internet will completely clog the tubes by 2010 unless significant investments are made in new infrastructure .
" In three years ' time , " warned Cicconi , " 20 typical households will generate more traffic than the entire Internet today . "
Cicconi also criticized the notion of net neutrality and implied that government regulation might impede AT&T 's efforts to remedy the upcoming bandwidth shortage .
AT&T has consistently used these " video and P2P will drown the Internet " speeches to argue that invasive network management practices and a variable pricing model in which content providers are forced to pay more for prioritization are the best way to prevent the Internet from suffocating in a pool of its own data like a washed - up rock star with a drinking problem .
But in talking to networking and Internet traffic experts , we 've consistently found that any real bandwidth crunches occur in the last mile , and AT&T has shown that it would rather invest its money into building a monopoly through acquisitions than into more backbone and last - mile capacity .
Although the total volume of content being pushed through the tubes is still growing , the growth rate of traffic through the Internet 's backbones has actually slowed in recent years .
The real bottleneck is the so - called last mile , the edges of the Internet , which is mostly copper and is limited in its scalability .
So despite Cicconi 's grim words , the so - called exaflood just is n't likely to drown AT&T 's backbone .
Peer - to - peer ( P2P ) traffic is a major contributor to last - mile congestion , but there are some effective technical measures that can be used to address that problem without resorting to blocks and other consumer - unfriendly tactics .
Verizon has proposed using network topology information to facilitate more efficient P2P communication , a solution that researchers believe will be less costly and more effective at unclogging the tubes than invasive traffic management practices that rely on deep packet inspection .
Verizon is also tackling last - mile congestion by replacing the copper with fiber and rolling it out directly to homes .
AT&T , however , has been reluctant to make a similar long - term investment in proper next - generation network infrastructure upgrades .
AT&T 's fiber - to - the - node upgrade strategy , which will provide less traffic scalability than Verizon 's approach , has been spectacularly botched .
Analyst Daniel Beringer argued in a 2006 article that network maintenance and upgrade expenditures are a lower priority for AT&T than attaining monopoly control of the market through acquisitions .
" The Bells only invest in more monopoly which usually means buying each other .
The track record shows steadily lower spending on networks to increase free cash flow for acquisitions .
The $ 140 billion SBC spent acquiring Ameritech , PacBell , SNET , AT&T Wireless , and AT&T lifted the company 's market cap by only $ 40 billion , " wrote Beringer .
" SBC missed an opportunity as $ 140 billion happens to be about what it would cost to run fiber to every home in America . "
So now we are supposed to feel sorry for AT&T and tolerate tiered network pricing because they claim that their service is so popular that they may actually have to ( * gasp * ) make and sell more of it ?
I can't really muster much sympathy at this point .

The single most pernicious threat to liberty today is humanity 's natural
tendency to misunderstand the statistics of rare events .
We 're just not wired to have good intuition about things that happen with extreme infrequency .
I 'll prove it .
If we were good at understanding statistics , then here 's what would happen when you flew to Las Vegas .
You 'd step out of McCarran airport , stare down the Strip at all those glittering , palatial casinos and say to yourself , " Holy crap – think of all the suckers who must have lost everything to finance this place ! "
Instead , our foolish minds are filled with thoughts like , " Man , look at all the money in this town – I 'm going to win big ! "
And another casino is built .
The rare – and the lurid – loom large in our imagination , and it's to our great detriment when it comes to our safety and security .
As a new father , I 'm understandably worried about the idea of my child falling victim to some nefarious predator Out There , waiting to break in and take my child away .
There 's a part of me who understands the panicked parent who rings 999 when he sees some street photographer aiming a lens at a kids ' playground .
But the fact is that attacks by strangers are so rare as to be practically nonexistent .
If your child is assaulted , the perpetrator is almost certainly a relative ( most likely a parent ) .
If not a relative , then a close family friend .
If not a close family friend , then a trusted authority figure .
And yet we continue to focus our attention on the meteor - strike - rare paedophile attack instead of protecting our children from the real , everyday dangers they face from the familiar .
This has the twin effects of making our children less safe , and of making adults less free , because we are all subjected to scrutiny on the grounds that we may be hunting children .
This is the same calculus that allows the fear of terrorism to take away our liberty : the statistically super - rare terrorist attacks present , on average , a much lower risk to our health , safety and person than , say , depriving us of our liquid medications , or of requiring us to leave our bags unlocked in flight so that sticky - fingered handlers can make off with our laptops and financial data and valuables .
The everyday threat of having our goods stolen , our ability to travel and earn our livings curtailed , and our personal information harvested by every junior terrorist fighter who wants to see your ID before letting you do anything is overshadowed by the one - in - a - billion confluence of someone with terrorist goals , the means to accomplish them , and the intelligence to bring them off ( hint : you can't really blow up an airplane with hair - gel and iPods ) .
Paradox of the false positive
Our innumeracy means that our fight against these super - rarities is likewise ineffective .
Statisticians speak of something called the Paradox of the False Positive .
Here 's how that works : imagine that you 've got a disease that strikes one in a million people , and a test for the disease that 's 99 % accurate .
You administer the test to a million people , and it will be positive for around 10,000 of them – because for every hundred people , it will be wrong once ( that 's what 99 % accurate means ) .
Yet , statistically , we know that there 's only one infected person in the entire sample .
That means that your " 99 % accurate " test is wrong 9,999 times out of 10,000 !
Terrorism is a lot less common than one in a million and automated " tests " for terrorism – data - mined conclusions drawn from transactions , Oyster cards , bank transfers , travel schedules , etc – are a lot less accurate than 99 % .
That means practically every person who is branded a terrorist by our data - mining efforts is innocent .
In other words , in the effort to find the terrorist needles in our haystacks , we 're just making much bigger haystacks .
You do n't get to understand the statistics of rare events by intuition .
It 's something that has to be learned , through formal and informal instruction .
If there 's one thing the government and our educational institutions could do to keep us safer , it 's this : teach us how statistics works .
They should drill it into us with the same vigor with which they approached convincing us that property values would rise forever , make it the subject of reality TV shows and infuse every corner of our news and politics with it .
Without an adequate grasp of these concepts , no one can ever tell for sure if he or she is safe .
According to an Associated Press report of May 20 , 2008 , New York Representative Vito Fossella will not seek re-election to Congress .
In the wake of Fossella ’s arrest for drunken driving on May 1 , it has come to light that the Republican congressman from New York has fathered a child with a Virginia woman , Laura Fay , who is a former Air Force lieutenant colonel and military liaison to Congress .
( Looks as though hers was a liaison dangereuse . )
Given that Fossella is married and has three children at home on Staten Island , this revelation does not bode well for his political future .
Okay , okay , you are saying .
Nothing is more humdrum than another exposure of a hypocritical congressman — naturally Fossella specialized in socially conservative positions that appealed to his many Catholic constituents .
But such always - gratifying revelations have a larger lesson to teach us : a member of Congress will not be forgiven a personal peccadillo , but he may with complete impunity commit the greatest crimes — grand larceny , mass murder , arson , and every other species of abomination — by authorizing and funding their commission by government agents .
Indeed , not only may a member of Congress act as an accessory to great crimes , he is expected to do so , and rewarded lavishly by the public with re-election to office and all the honors and aggrandizements that accompany his entrenchment in that occult and wicked temple known as the Capitol .
Steal a hundred dollars , go to jail ; steal a trillion dollars , go on to fame and fortune as a public servant .
Kill one man , go to the gas chamber ; kill a million people , go on to well - paid retirement at public expense and big bucks on the lecture circuit .
Alert children are learning these lessons , and acting accordingly when they become old enough to run for election to public office .
Not only have Americans split the atom , they have — mirabile dictu— split their moral sense .
Countless actions for which any ordinary person would be denounced to the heavens will serve to sustain a lifetime ’s political career .
Lie , cheat , and steal and your friends will condemn and abandon you , but do the same on a hugely greater scale in your capacity as a public representative and the voters will stand by you to the end .
Just do n’t father an out - of - wedlock child .
That ’s so vile !
Purely Functional Retrogames , Part 4
( Read Part 1 if you missed it . )
By the definition of functional programming , functions can't access any data that is n't passed in .
That means you need to think about what data is needed for a particular function , and " thread " that data through your program so a function can access it .
It sounds horrible when written down , but it 's easy in practice .
In fact , just working out the data dependencies in a simple game is an eye - opening exercise .
It usually turns out that there are far fewer dependencies than you might imagine .
In Pac - Man , there 's an awful lot of state that makes no difference to how the ghosts move : the player 's score , whether the fruit is visible or not , the location of dots in the maze .
Similarly , the core movement of Pac - Man , ignoring collision detection , only relies on a handful of factors : the joystick position , the location of walls in the maze ( which are constant , because there 's only one maze ) , and the current movement speed ( which increases as mazes are completed ) .
That was the easy part .
The tricky bit is how to handle functions that affect the state of the world .
Now of course a function does n't actually change anything , but somehow those effects on the world need to be passed back out so the rest of the game knows about them .
The " move Pac - Man " routine returns the new state of Pac - Man ( see Part 3 for more about how entity state is represented ) .
If collision detection is part of the " move Pac - Man " function , then there are more possible changes to the world : a dot has been eaten , a power pill has been eaten , fruit has been eaten , Pac - Man is dead ( because of collision with a non - blue ghost ) , a ghost is dead ( because of a collision with a powered - up Pac - Man ) .
When I first mused over writing a game in a purely functional style , this had me stymied .
One simple function ends up possibly changing the entire state of the world ?
Should that function take the whole world as input and return a brand new world as output ?
Why even use functional programming , then ?
A clean alternative is not to return new versions of anything , but to simply return statements about what happened .
Using the above example , the movement routine would return a list of any of these side effects :
{new_position , Coordinates} {ate_ghost , GhostName} {ate_dot , Coordinates} ate_fruit killed_by_ghost
All of a sudden things are a lot simpler .
You can pass in the relevant parts of the state of the world , and get back a simple list detailing what happened .
Actually handling what happened is a separate step , one that can be done later on in the frame .
The advantage here is that changes to core world data do n't have to be painstakingly threaded in and out of all functions in the game .
I 'd like to write some concluding thoughts on this series , to answer the " Why do this ? " and " What about Functional Reactive Programming ? " questions -- among others -- but wow I 've already taken just about a month for these four short entries , so I 'm not going to jump into that just yet .
( I eventually wrote the follow - up . )

“ A day without fun is a day that eats shit . ” — Hunter S. Thompson , circa 1992
In 1998 , as the movie version of Hunter S. Thompson ’s Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas was about to be released , Cheryl Della Pietra wrote a story for P.O.V .
Magazine about her experience serving as Thompson ’s assistant at his storied Woody Creek , Colorado compound .
Her editor on the piece was SMITH Magazine founder Larry Smith , who asked Della Pietra if he could reprint her terrific tale here , as something of a compliment to SMITH ’s excerpt of Gonzo : An Oral History of Hunter S. Thompson .
What follows is that story , with small edits for clarity , mostly reflecting the fact that at the time of Della Pietra ’s writing Thompson was alive .
Wanted : Editorial Assistant
Job Description : Must enjoy late - night hot - tubbing , chain - smoking , binge dessert eating , drinking hard alcohol , mixing margaritas and driving large cars in a reckless manner .
Should be able to withstand frequent yelling and loud noises , unintelligible rantings , and handle firearms and exploding targets with ease .
Knowledge of soft porn a plus .
Curiosity about the limits of sleep deprivation helpful .
Knowledge of housecleaning and faxing imperative .
Young and sexy recreational drug users encouraged to apply .
That ’s what someone should have told me .
But I could barely understand the mumble on the other end of the phone at 3 AM as it was .
“ Who the hell is this ? ” I barked .
“ Hunter Thompson . ”
“ Oh , shit . ”
The mumble told me to get my ass on a plane the next day .
The author of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas was looking for an assistant to help out on his forthcoming novel , Polo Is My Life , and had received my letter and resume .
“ Come out for the weekend , we ’ll see how things work out . ”
There would be a ticket waiting for me at the airport .
I did n’t go back to sleep .
When the Going Gets Weird
“ It was Easter Sunday .
A friend and I were out driving and she fired a couple of those little screamers you use to scare away birds , and all of a sudden they were threatening to arrest me … ”
— Hunter S. Thompson , Playboy magazine , October 1992
I guess there are more compromising ways a 22 - year - old woman can end up in the pages of Playboy .
I had barely been in the company of Hunter 24 hours before I got us in trouble with the law .
For any other job , this was grounds for dismissal , for this one , it was like gunning for a promotion .
Hunter , with his trademark Tilley hat , cigarette holder and sunglasses , greeted me himself at the Aspen , Colorado , airport , following a bumpy plane ride made worse by my fear of flying .
Other than a welcome lunch filled with an excess of Champagne and tequila , the man seemed downright normal .
I was brought to his Woody Creek compound , a remote tract 8,000 feet above sea level , and I settled into a small cabin adjacent to the main house , which I would share with his longtime personal assistant , Deborah .
I went to sleep wondering what the fuss was all about .
Day
Two started out innocently as well , with breakfast at the famed Woody Creek Tavern , where groupies hang out hoping to catch a glimpse of the local hero .
There was no sense of impending mayhem when we decided to go for a Sunday drive up the mountain .
Then we packed the car .
One bottle of Champagne , one .44 magnum , one pipe , one pack of Dunhill blues ( for me ) , one pack of reds ( for him ) , a bottle of green Chartreuse , a whole chocolate cake , a bag of , uh , fungus , a screecher gun used for scaring away birds , one glass of scotch with lots of ice and a blanket .
A picnic for a madman — and his new hire .
Driving in the red convertible up the mountain , sampling the assembled feast , I could feel the mischief rising like a fever .
When we reached the top of the mountain and were met by a bunch of snowmobilers blocking the road , it never entered my mind that anything was wrong with taking the screecher gun and firing two times into the air .
All right , I guess it looked like a real gun , and since Hunter was behind the wheel , I was just as shocked as anyone that it was n’t .
On the way back down the mountain , we set up exploding targets on the side of the road and I shot at one with the .44 .
For me it was like losing my virginity to John Holmes .
I had never even touched a real gun before , and between the kickback and the noise , I was hooked .
By the time I noticed the sirens behind us , I was too messed up to fully understand what was happening — and almost totally deaf .
When the cops asked for my ID , I just smiled and laughed .
When they asked my name , Hunter reprimanded , “ You do n’t have to talk to the cops ! ”
Well , he would know .
I just smiled and laughed .
Luckily — shockingly — the fuzz did n’t search the car .
And I realized later on this warm spring day , that ’s what the blanket was for …
But who did I think I was dealing with ?
An amateur ?
Looking back , it ’s clear that Day Two was decision time .
I had passed Hunter ’s test .
I had managed to piss off the cops , keep my mouth shut and not rat on anyone — in other words , do all the things a faithful assistant to the father of gonzo journalism is supposed to do .
And while I could easily have shoved off and gone back east , as most people would have , I was trying to figure out exactly who I was and what I wanted to do .
And something told me that hanging around this man — this deranged man whose legendary tales I had devoured throughout my college years — would help me learn exactly that .
Notes on Gonzo
For the uninitiated : Hunter S. Thompson was the originator of “ gonzo ” journalism .
Loosely translated , to be gonzo is to embed yourself in a subject matter so thoroughly that you actually live it .
Thompson perfected this craft through a series of ground - breaking works : Hell ’s Angels , Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas , On the Campaign Trail ‘ 72 , The Great Shark Hunt , among others .
And although one of the great mistakes many writers make is thinking that everything that happens to them is interesting ; in the case of Hunter S. Thompson , it is .
In defining the generation of the sixties and seventies , he is in the company of John Lennon .
As a writer , he rivalled Norman Mailer in both pure ego and utter eloquence .
And as an addict and a madman , he put Keith Richards to shame .
All this comes together in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas , the book — and later film , with Johnny Depp as Hunter — that remains firmly at the center of what has become the Cult of Thompson .
Hunter S. Thompson FAQs
How exactly does one land a job with Hunter Thompson ?
Pure luck , actually .
A friend was working at Rolling Stone , and Hunter ( long after most of his reporting for the magazine was behind him , Thompson remained on the masthead , cloaked as his alter ego , Raoul Duke ) had informed the magazine he was looking for an assistant , preferably female .
I wrote a fairly unorthodox letter , and he rang me up two days later .
It did n’t hurt that I was a bartender at the time .
Does he really do all of those drugs ?
Yes .
Constantly .
This monumental intake is accompanied by a tall tumbler of scotch on the rocks , which is replenished with fresh ice and booze — constantly — from morning till night .
He unapologetically did n’t 12 - step his way into old age ; indeed , at the point in his life when I met him , he ’d probably have croaked if he stopped .
What did you do there ?
This is a tough one to explain at a job interview .
I went , ostensibly , to help him work on his long - promised novel , Polo Is My Life .
The project has been in the works for seemingly forever , and the lack of progress makes sense .
Thompson writing a work of fiction is like Madonna trying to act .
What ’s the point ?
When the political campaign of 1992 started to heat up , he just could n’t help himself .
The writing that ensued eventually turned into Better Than Sex : Confessions of a Political Junkie .
Did you have any , you know , shenanigans with him ?
Actually , no .
There was a fumbled kiss in the car on the day we almost were arrested , but the instant I rebuffed , he went out and got himself a girlfriend .
I did not envy her .
We Are , After All , Professionals
All insanity aside , there was work to be done .
There were no rules and no routine , and the recipe for success was different every night .
The general organizing principle : to have Hunter ’s hands on the typewriter by 2 ( AM , that is ) .
My job was akin to caging a wild animal and slowly cornering it into submission .
The mentor / apprentice roles were blurry .
Obviously he was the mentor , but it was almost impossible to get him focused ; I was the apprentice , yet it was I who was sometimes forced to bark orders .
I was considered successful if pages were stacked up the next day , no matter what words landed on them .
In effect , it was my job to usher in the environment that would make the magic happen .
While that job description might sound like a glorified babysitter , when you ’re babysitting a lunatic genius , it ’s a hell of a job .
The evenings went down like this :
What I wanted to do :
Sit down , talk about the current text , see if we could n’t get a direction going for the next chapter .
What he wanted to do : Jump into the hot tub with a whole key lime pie , a cell phone , a bottle of Champagne and Caligula on in the background .
Well , he was the boss .
The Night Shift
My stint slinging drinks had weaned me off the nine - to - five shift , but this was more like active vampirism .
Deborah would help him with his personal affairs during the day ; at around 9 PM , we ’d have an unspoken shift change and I ’d take over to help him with his writing .
When everything was working , the good nights were magic .
The constant feed of CNN on the large - screen TV was our background noise , the typewriter would sing , he ’d crank up Lyle Lovett .
These wholly private moments — the night shift — would lend a dark creativity apparent in most of Thompson ’s work .
We ’d be left with a respectable stack of pages , then at sunrise we ’d go out on the shooting range and fire off a few .
As one would expect when dealing with a person of extremes , the bad nights with Hunter were like being chained to a bar where the bad drunk really wants to talk to you .
“ You stupid 22 - year - old WOP !
Did n’t you read anything ? ! ”
This was one of the major reprimands — not having memorized every goddamn word the man ever wrote , or even read .
I was once banished to my cabin at three in the morning to reread The Great Gatsby .
I was once kicked out after failing to recall a portion of the end of his book Songs of the Doomed .
I witnessed broken lamps , broken dishes .
( The latter was a Frisbee throw that just missed my head .
“ I did not try and hit you , so do n’t go around saying that I ’m abusing you . ”
Even though he was serious , it actually made me laugh . )
Evenings like this were a race to see who could be reduced to a quivering mess first .
To leave would be to admit defeat .
But to stay was sure torture .
Eventually I would leave and go back to my cabin next door .
The morning would almost always bring a note of apology , or a phone call to the same effect .
That ’s just how things worked .
He was a Southern gentleman at heart , and at least he could apologize like one .
Coming Down
Three months later , I was growing weary , not unlike Jennifer Jason Leigh toward the end of Rush .
I was nervous , sleep deprived and so tired of everything being so BIG .
Trips to the gardening center wound up as portable flower shows .
Every jaunt to the liquor store was like buying for a wedding reception .
Lunch was like a damn buffet .
I began to understand that tedium can occur under any circumstances ; even the most extreme can turn dull with repetition .
Scotch for breakfast ?
Again ?
Really ?
Additionally , I had too much ego for the position .
Thompson always hires young women , and I think I figured out why .
The job , ultimately , is to nurture .
Become selfless .
Stroke .
The insecurity and paranoia that are inevitable accessories to genius gave way to this giant ego .
With the lot of us around him almost constantly — his personal assistant , his girlfriend , myself — there were no large egos to fight his .
At least that was the deal if you wanted to stay .
But how long can you feed the dreams of others before you lose sight of you own ?
I found I could do it for one long summer .
Then it was time to go .
The Way You Wear Your Hat
My last day was everything a last day at a job is supposed to be — only , of course , bigger .
Most jobs involve lunch out with your coworkers , perhaps a nice parting gift .
( A beige blouse ?
Gee , thanks ! )
But at this one , Hunter , his girlfriend and I caught a chartered plane to Denver .
We were going to a party at his attorney ’s place .
As I looked out the window of the turboprop , I realized that my fear of flying had disappeared .
Perhaps it was the fact that I had been living on the outer edges for the previous months , but the perspective it lent made my everyday worries seem , well , boring .
We landed and were met by a limo that carted us to the party .
It was my first time away from Woody Creek in a while , and I experienced a low - level culture shock .
The schmoozing legal and political types might as well have been a bunch of hedges on the lawn .
Get me a drink , was all I could think .
I can only imagine the picture we cut : Hunter and his two ruby - red - lipsticked , chain - smoking vixens .
We , in color , wove through the black - and - white crowd .
( I vaguely remember meeting Gary Hart . )
I was here that I realized I had become an addict .
I was addicted to the rush of life — to a degree I had never imagined , a degree most people never know .
And as if to put an exclamation point on this , Hunter threw me into the pool , fully clothed , and when he went to offer me a hand out , I pulled him right in with me .
So we swam , Hunter and I …until it was time to go .
And indeed , it was .
He left me in Denver to catch my plane .
During our last moments in the limo , he peeled off a couple of hundred - dollar bills , gave me a kiss and thanked me for my time there .
Then he was gone .
The limo driver escorted me to the airport , and as I was gathering my things , I realized I was sitting on something .
Oh my God .
The Hat .
I put it on , grabbed my flight , and never thought once about sending it back .
It looked good on me .
There are certain moments that make impressions that stay with you no matter how far away from them you travel .
Strangely , most of the time I spent with Hunter , both high points and nightmares , stands out in bold relief six years later .
But of all the strong memories I have from that time , this is the one I remember most : “ A day without fun is a day that eats shit . ”
Hunter paused and looked at me like I was an idiot .
“ Write that down ! ” he barked .
Dutifully , I added it to the random notes I had been keeping and noted “ HST , 12:48 AM , 4/8/92 . ”
Although the one notebook I smuggled out of Woody Creek has other bizarre unintelligible notations , all written down in the name of some split - second inspiration ( ” He gained 25 pounds of pure muscle and 100 pounds of rage .

In what officials are calling a " tragic medical error , " a surgical team removed the wrong kidney from a patient with kidney cancer last week at Methodist Hospital in St. Louis Park , the hospital disclosed Monday .
Officials said the error occurred weeks before the surgery , when the kidney on the wrong side was identified on the patient 's medical charts as cancerous .
The patient , who was not identified , was left with the cancerous kidney when the healthy one was removed .
" We feel just profoundly responsible for this , " said Dr. Samuel Carlson , chief medical officer for Park Nicollet Health Services , which owns Methodist Hospital .
Hospital officials said that they apologized to the patient and family , and " are working closely with them to support them in every way we can . "
The hospital took the unusual step of announcing the mistake in a memo to Park Nicollet employees on Monday .
" An error of this degree has , to the best of our knowledge , never happened at this hospital before , " Carlson said .
Officials would not discuss what effect it may have on the patient 's chances of recovery .
They said the family has asked for privacy , that " the patient has chosen to remain at Methodist Hospital " and that all treatment options are being discussed .
" This is a devastating tragedy for the family , " officials said in Monday 's staff memo .
" It is also a tragedy for all of us at Park Nicollet . "
They said the surgeon in this case has voluntarily stopped seeing patients until the hospital completes its inquiry of how the mistake occurred .
Statewide , a total of 24 wrong - site surgeries were reported to the Minnesota Department of Health between October 2006 and October 2007 .
Two of those errors were at Methodist , but Carlson said they were relatively minor in comparison to last week 's error : a needle biopsy on the wrong lung , and a diagnostic exam of the wrong bronchial tube .
He said they decided to go public in this case because of its unusual nature and severity .
This time , he said , the mistake was " certainly more severe and more significant . "
Kathleen Harder , a University of Minnesota researcher who studies medical errors , said mistakes of this magnitude are rare but do happen .
" They remove the wrong ovary , take off the wrong leg , " she said .
Many hospitals have stepped up efforts to catch errors in the operating room .
But as in this case , she noted , the problem can occur long before the operation begins .
" It 's wrong in the chart ... and that sets it up for a train wreck . "
Nationally , wrong site surgeries are proving difficult to eliminate , according to the Health Department 's annual report on medical errors .
In December , the Minnesota Hospital Association started a statewide campaign to try to reduce the number of wrong - site surgeries , with such things as safety checklists and routines for marking surgical sites .
Some 90 hospitals agreed to adopt those procedures .
Methodist said those procedures were used in this case .
But the day after surgery , a hospital pathologist reported that the kidney that had been removed had no evidence of cancer .
Hospital officials would not talk about the next steps for this patient .
But Carlson , speaking generally , said that the options would depend on individual circumstances , such as " where the cancer in the kidney was located , " and whether only that part could be removed .
Asked about the possibility of a kidney transplant , he said that would depend on a patient 's condition , as well .
In some cases , he noted , a history of cancer could make someone ineligible for a transplant .
Ultimately , the decision will be up to the patient and the patient 's family .
" As you can imagine , currently they are needing a lot of support and understanding , " he said , " and we 're doing our very best to provide them with that . "

Apparently having realized they 've lost the netroots and not giving a damn anymore , the Hillary campaign has decided they want to legitimize the right - wing propagandists on Fox News after all .
In a conference call with reporters , Clinton strategist Mark Penn announced that Clinton would like to face off against Obama in one debate every week between now and March 4 .
" The campaign believes that it ’s critically important that we continue the debate , " he said , citing the questions of " who offers universal healthcare and who 's best prepared to fix the economy . "
Debates have , generally , been stronger turf for Clinton , but it's also a mark of the shifting dynamic :
You do n't usually see the frontrunner demanding debates .
Penn said Clinton would like to see debates in Ohio , Texas , and Washington , and had already accepted three : One on ABC's This Week with George Stephanopolous , one CNN debate in Ohio February 27 , and an MSNBC debate the next day hosted by Chris Matthews .
Wolfson also said Clinton has accepted a debate on Fox News , something Democrats shunned last year .
That debate is scheduled for February 11 , in Washington D.C. , and would also air on the local Fox affiliate .
Drugs for epilepsy , bipolar illness and mood problems double the risks of suicidal thoughts and behavior , and patients taking them should be watched for sudden behavioral changes , drug regulators have said .
The increased risks , while double in relative terms , are small .
The Food and Drug Administration undertook a combined analysis of 199 clinical trials with 43,892 patients and found 4 suicides and 105 reports of suicidal symptoms among the 27,863 patients who were given the drugs compared to no suicides and 35 reports of suicidal symptoms among the 16,029 patients treated with placebos .
Taken together , the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior was 0.43 percent for those on drug therapy and 0.22 percent for those given placebos .
These medications are primarily used to help epileptics control seizures and to calm the surges in energy and mood that , along with bouts of depression , characterize bipolar disorder .
The drugs , which include Depakote , Lamictal , Topamax , Keppra , Lyrica and Neurontin , are sometimes prescribed for chronic pain and headaches , as well .

Patrick Moore sits in a dark mahogany booth at the Off the Record bar across from the White House .
Clad in a conservative navy blue suit , he blends comfortably with the crowd of lobbyists and politicians — a far cry from his former identity as a scruffy - faced Greenpeace leader battling nuclear power .
Now , between sips of pinot grigio , he ’s offering up dubious factoids : Nuclear waste is safe enough to store in a backyard swimming pool , the areas around the plants are “ as clean as nature preserves , ” and Three Mile Island was a success story because no radiation was emitted .
He dismisses anti-nuke arguments as “ illogical imaginary fears . ”
Moore may be the most adamant of the nuclear revival ’s environmental converts ; he pushes his agenda in interviews like this one , in op - eds for papers like the Washington Post and Boston Globe , in presentations from Detroit to South Africa , and in private meetings with D.C. legislators .
At the bar , he ’s so revved that it ’s hard to get a word in edgewise .
It ’s also hard to take him at face value , given that he ’s a paid spokesman for the Nuclear Energy Institute ( nei ) , the industry ’s trade and lobbying powerhouse .
In 2006 , aiming to promote a “ nuclear renaissance , ” the nei enlisted public - relations giant Hill & Knowlton , which , back in Atoms for Peace days , commanded Big Tobacco ’s siege on the science linking smoking to cancer .
Hill & Knowlton in turn hired Moore and former Environmental Protection Agency chief Christine Todd Whitman as its public front .
On April 24 , 2006 , two days before the 20th anniversary of the Chernobyl meltdown , it launched the Clean and Safe Energy ( case nergy ) Coalition to spread the nuclear gospel , with Moore and Whitman at the helm .
The industry has attempted this sort of thing before .
In 1998 , the Better Business Bureau censured as false advertising an nei ad campaign promoting nuclear power as environmentally clean .
In 2004 , the nei hired Potomac Communications Group to ghostwrite op - eds supporting storage of nuclear waste at Nevada ’s Yucca Mountain .
Even Moore in his Greenpeace days warned of “ very high - powered public relations organizations ” on the industry payroll .
“ One can no more trust them to tell the truth about nuclear power than about which brand of toothpaste [ to buy ] , ” he wrote in 1976 .
Moore and Whitman ’s early reputations — George W. Bush named Whitman his first epa chief as a sort of compromise with the green community — would make them ideal industry boosters were it not for their histories of selling green credibility to corporate pariahs .
For 17 years , largely through his consulting firm Greenspirit Strategies , Moore has advocated for logging , mining , chemical , biotech , and plastics industries .
His former peers now call him an “ eco-Judas . ”
Whitman left the epa in 2004 and launched her own consulting group , which helps companies such as Chevron , Citgo , and chemical manufacturer fmc “ overcome obstacles ” in their dealings with government agencies , including the epa .
( fmc alone has generated 87 Superfund sites and at least 33 epa enforcement citations . )
When employees of New Jersey ’s environmental protection department were surveyed in 1997 , during Whitman ’s gubernatorial tenure , two - thirds of respondents said business interests had excessive influence over their department ’s permitting , policy , and enforcement decisions .
Although Hill & Knowlton coordinates the coalition ’s activities , Moore and Whitman stress that their opinions are their own — to suggest otherwise , a case nergy rep cautions , “ borders on slander . ”
Moore concedes that the PR firm provides him with briefing papers , but “ I approve of every single op - ed , letter to the editor , and utterance that is attributed to me , ” he says .
“ I read it , help write it , and approve it . ”
And yet , it ’s hard to reconcile case nergy ’s fission - for - the - planet arguments with Moore ’s denunciations of the scientific proof of climate change —
” It is a risk , not a certainty , ” he clarifies , calling emissions reduction “ an insurance policy ” — or with Whitman ’s false post - 9/11 declaration that airborne toxins from ground zero posed no risks to Big Apple residents .
Among their coalition ’s 1,500 members are nuclear energy companies , industry groups , and trade unions that stand to profit from an industry resurgence , as well as politicians and groups like the Science and Environmental Policy Project , which opposes the global warming “ myth . ”
Among their other duties , Moore , Whitman , and fellow coalition members have kept busy with “ town meetings ” set up by Hill & Knowlton to convince cities like Detroit and Cedar Rapids to host nuclear plants .
The firm invites chamber of commerce folks , local politicians , and union leaders , bolstering the presentations with nei - funded polls .
The pollster is Bisconti Research , whose president , Ann Bisconti , has served as a board member for the American Nuclear Society and as a vice president of the nei , and whose client list includes a who ’s who of nuclear interests .
Sample survey question ( agree or disagree ) : “ We should take advantage of all low - carbon energy sources , including nuclear , hydro and renewable energy , to produce the electricity we need while limiting greenhouse gas emissions . ”
Moore and Whitman also hook up with legislators such as New Mexico Senator Pete Domenici , a Republican sponsor of the 2005 Energy Policy Act. ( See “ Fossil Fools “ )
Moore claims they need n’t register as lobbyists because they do n’t lobby ; they educate .
Regarding their close ties , Hill & Knowlton , case nergy , and the nei are unapologetic .
Scott Peterson , the trade group ’s spokesman , says , “ We ’ve been transparent from the start . ”
But only if asked directly : From April 2006 through March 2007 , according to the Center for Media and Democracy , just 12 percent of the 302 news stories that mentioned Moore in relation to nuclear power noted his nei connection .
Peterson says it ’s not the industry ’s fault that reporters are lazy , but the NEI ’s website identifies Moore and Whitman simply as “ environmentalists , ” and they introduce themselves in public as Greenpeace cofounder and former epa chief .
Moore ’s presentations even include a slide show about his Greenpeace days .
At a Progressive Policy Institute forum in February , Moore sounded irked when asked about his industry ties .
“ I do n’t see how being a successful environmentalist working for the things you believe in can diminish your credibility , ” he later said .
Moore ’s credibility among environmentalists , however , could hardly be worse .
“ How can a bunch of seemingly smart , reasonable people be saying this stuff that ’s scientifically and politically unfounded ?
It boggles my mind , ” says Julia Bovey of the Natural Resources Defense Council .
“ Moore and Whitman say they ’ve seen the light , ” adds Jim Riccio , Greenpeace ’s nuclear - policy analyst .
“ Unfortunately , I think they ’re not interested in the green of the movement but of the dollar . ”

When gunpowder was used to create personal handguns and rifles , a new type of soldier was created : infantry .
Photo shows a Revolutionary War reenactment at Fort Ward Historic Site in Alexandria , Virginia .
Each Monday , this column turns a page in history to explore the discoveries , events and people that continue to affect the history being made today .
Ironically , it was a quest for immortality that led to the invention of the deadliest weapon before the arrival of the atomic bomb .
Experimenting with life - lengthening elixirs around A.D. 850 , Chinese alchemists instead discovered gunpowder .
Their explosive invention would become the basis for almost every weapon used in war from that point on , from fiery arrows to rifles , cannons and grenades .
Gunpowder made warfare all over the world very different , affecting the way battles were fought and borders were drawn throughout the Middle Ages .
Flying fire
Chinese scientists had been playing with saltpeter — a common name for the powerful oxidizing agent potassium nitrate — in medical compounds for centuries when one industrious individual thought to mix it with sulfur and charcoal .
The result was a mysterious powder from which , observers remarked in a text dated from the mid-9th century , " smoke and flames result , so that [ the scientists ' ] hands and faces have been burnt , and even the whole house where they were working burned down . "
Gunpowder was quickly put to use by the reigning Sung dynasty against the Mongols , whose constant invasions into the country plagued the Chinese throughout the period .
The Mongols were the first to be subject to flying fire — an arrow fixed with a tube of gunpowder that ignited and would propel itself across enemy lines .
More gunpowder - based weapons were invented by the Chinese and perfected against the Mongols in the next centuries , including the first cannons and grenades .
The psychological effect alone of the mystifying new technology likely helped the Chinese win battles against the Mongols , historians believe .
Explosive trade
Gunpowder somehow remained a monopoly of the Chinese until the 13th century , when the science was passed along the ancient silk trade route to Europe and the Islamic world , where it became a deciding factor in many Middle Age skirmishes .
By 1350 , rudimentary gunpowder cannons were commonplace in the English and French militaries , which used the technology against each other during the Hundred Years ' War .
The Ottoman Turks also employed gunpowder cannons with abandon during their successful siege of Constantinople in 1453 .
The powerful new weapon essentially rendered the traditional walled fortification of Europe , impregnable for centuries , weak and defenseless .
The next important step for gunpowder came when it was inserted into the barrel of a handgun , which first appeared in the mid-15th century and was essentially a cannon shrunk down to portable size .
Guns literally put weaponry into the hands of the individual , creating a new class of soldier — infantry — and giving birth to the modern army .
Gunpowder is still the basis for many modern weapons , including guns , though it 's certainly no longer the most explosive force available to armies .
Need to celebrate a victory in battle , though ?
Gunpowder is there for you .
The powder is also at the heart of the fireworks that make the Fourth of July and other holidays so special .
To produce the aerial spray of reds , golds and blues , pyrotechnicians pack a tube with gunpowder , colorizing chemicals and small pellets that create the shape and shimmer of the firework .

Building executables with PAR
[ Perl tips index ]
[ Subscribe to Perl tips ]
One of Perl 's greatest strengths is the huge number of modules available on the CPAN .
Many really tricky problems can be made quite simple with just the use of a few appropriate modules .
Unfortunately , using CPAN modules results in another problem .
Using modules makes development easier , but it makes installing code much more difficult .
Not only do we have to ensure that the modules we use are installed , but we also need to ensure they modules they depend upon also get installed .
Worst of all , we may be writing code for machines that do n't even have Perl installed at all , or a version so old that none of our modules work on it .
If this seems familiar , then PAR , the Perl Archiver , may provide relief from your installation woes .
PAR allows you to bundle all of your modules , configuration files , and other dependencies into a single compressed archive , and then distribute that along with , or instead of , your code .
Creating a PAR file ( simple )
At the most basic level a PAR file is just a regular zip file , but with a .par extension .
You can use any zip tool to create them , such as right - clicking a file in Windows XP , and selecting ``Send to -> compressed ( zipped ) folder '' , by using the ' zip ' command under Unix , or by using the Archive : : Zip module in Perl .
zip example .par Foo.pm Bar / Baz.pm
Using a PAR file
Before we show you how to create a PAR file , let 's see how to use one .
It 's as simple as :
use PAR " example.par " ; use Bar : : Baz ; # Loads Bar : : Baz from example.par
If you have a lot of . par files , you can even specify a file pattern match :
use PAR " /home/ mylibs /*.par " ; use Bar : : Baz ;
The PAR module itself has very few dependencies , and so is very easy to install on your target system .
Creating a PAR file ( advanced )
Being able to create a . par file using nothing but your system 's zip management tools is very convenient , but it still means you have the effort of finding all your dependencies and adding them to the archive .
Worse still , if your dependencies change , you have to go through the whole process again .
Fortunately , we can use the PAR Packager , pp , to do all the hard work for us .
pp comes as part of the Par - Packer distribution on CPAN , and has quite a few dependencies .
However you 'll only need pp on your build system , not your target system .
Let 's start with the situation where you have a program , and you want to find all its dependencies and wrap them up into a . par file .
Using pp , we can simply write :
pp -p -o archive .par hello.pl
The -o switch specifies our output file name , and the -p switch tells pp we 're building a <. par > file , rather than anything else ( like a stand - alone executable ) .
The resulting archive . par contains all the dependencies for our program , and can be loaded with use PAR " archive.par " , or opened using a zip tool , just like an archive we built ourselves .
However the resulting archive . par built by pp also contains our original program .
If we 're running on a system that already has PAR :: Packer installed , we can run our program with parl :
parl archive.par
Sometimes pp will miss a dependency , perhaps because it 's loaded in a strange way , or perhaps we just want to bundle extra modules into our archive , even though our main program does n't use them .
We can always add additional modules with the -M switch .
For example , the following adds the IPC :: System : : Simple module to our archive , as well as all the modules that hello.pl depends upon :
pp -p -M IPC :: System :: Simple -o archive .par hello.pl
Creating a stand - alone Perl program
The < pp > program is able to create stand - alone Perl programs , saving us the effort of having to include all our modules into a . par file , modifying our program to use it , and then shipping them both together .
To do this , we simply use - P instead of -p when building our archives :
pp - P -o portable.pl hello.pl
The resulting portable .pl file contains hello.pl , and all the non -core modules it depends upon .
It can be run with :
perl portable .
pl
As of PAR :: Packer 0.977 , the program still depends upon PAR having been installed on the target system .
Creating a stand - alone executable
One of the greatest uses of PAR is being able to create a stand - alone executable , which will work on systems that do n't even have perl installed , or an extremely old version of perl that we 'd rather not use .
Building an executable is what pp does by default , if not directed otherwise .
Of course , it will only run on the same architecture as it was built , so to build a Windows executable you 'll need to use pp on Windows , or to build a Linux binary you 'll need to use pp on Linux .
To use our previous examples , we could write :
pp -o hello.exe hello.pl # Windows pp -o hello hello.pl # Linux
to create a stand - alone hello . exe file that can be run without perl , PAR , or any additional modules .
You can also use pp to include additional shared libraries , or other dependencies that your program needs .
For example , on a Unix flavoured system we can include the system libncurses .
so with :
pp -l ncurses -o hello hello.pl
For a more lengthy example of building a Windows executable which depends upon numerous .dll files , see the MakeExe.pl file for App :: SweeperBot in the further references section below .
Conclusion
By using PAR , we can solve the most common problems when trying to distribute dependency - rich perl programs , with a minimum of work needed on the target system .
By using pp , we can even distribute stand - alone perl executables to systems that do n't even have perl installed at all .
PAR has many more features , and a very rich API , that have not been covered in this tip .

Load testing is essential in ensuring that your software or device works properly .
Before you can release it for others to use , you want to make sure that it will not cause any issues with consumers or with widespread usage .
After all , you plan for success , not failure , and you want to protect yourself so that you can succeed fully .
Load testing is one way to do this .
Selenium is one option for load testing , offering consistent and accurate results each time .
It can help you to get the right results , and there are plenty of people who rely on it .
However , it might not be the best tool on the market for such a thing .
Load Testing and Selenium
When you run a website or software , or have made a new device , you have to make sure that your creation works .
Part of this is making sure that it works under pressure .
If it cracks or if it experiences issues with regular usage , or when there is a high amount of usage , you will want to fix that before sending it out .
You also want to test its limits , see how it functions , and learn more about its functionality under heavy usage .
Doing this with Selenium is possible .
Selenium allows you to load test quite effectively , and it is a somewhat popular option for it .
However , it is not the best .
For most people , Selenium is an advance option that goes beyond what you need .
Paying money for it might not be the best idea if you only want to load test .
The Results
If you prefer Selenium for any reason or already have it , you can use it for load testing .
It works exceptionally well for load running performance tests .
Its results are accurate and consistent , and it has a lot of other features that make it effective for this .
You can expect great work every time , and you can use it rather easily .
It is something that you can begin using for your business nearly immediately .
Anyone considering Selenium for load testing should see positive results .
While it is not the perfect choice in this situation , because it might be more than you need , it does a great job .
High quality , accurate , and consistent , it is one of the best software out there .
If you like it for what it is , it is well worth getting .

Frog Migration : Omen to China Earthquake Disaster
On May 5th , many Chinese locals noticed thousands of frogs on the move .
They were seen traveling without fear of traffic as they crossed streets in mass floods .
Many Chinese sensed the migration as a bad omen of a coming natural disaster , but the Chinese government told them that it was just a natural migration for the purpose of propagation .
This calmed the people and no one took the omen very seriously .
On Monday , 12th of May , at about 2:45 pm , central China region recorded a 7.8 - magnitude quake which occured near Wenchuan County , Sichuan province , that killed nearly 10,000 people .
Many civilian houses and roads were collapsed and damaged .
In one Dujiangyan city middle school , 900 students and teachers were buried in the collapsed building , at least 50 were killed .
The quake was the largest the region has seen for over a generation .
It was so strong , even countries like Thailand , Vietnam and Hong Kong felt the shake .
Many people are now calling the Chinese Earthquake Test Centers “ useless ” , as they were unable to even detect the earthquake before it happened .
When they finally announced the earthquake had occured , it was 12 minutes after the disaster , and 2 minutes after the US had announced a large earthquake in China .
As for the Frogs and their omen , Chinese scientists stated animals have much better sense than human on detecting the natural disasters like this .
So much for “ migration for propagation ” .

Adult male Amazon river dolphins , or botos , carry natural objects such as sticks and rocks , sometimes throwing them or thrashing them against the surface , likely to impress females .
Just as men can use fast cars or showy clothes to impress the ladies , so too do male Amazon river dolphins show off stuff to woo the opposite sex .
Among these dolphins , the attention - getter is a male carrying a branch or similar flotsam in its mouth .
Such " player " behavior is a first to be documented in aquatic mammals and , among land mammals , it has previously been seen only in chimpanzees and humans , researchers said .
These new findings help show that humans are " not as different from other animals as some might like to think , " said researcher Anthony Martin , a behavioral ecologist and population biologist at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland .
Amazon river dolphins , also known as botos or pink river dolphins ( Inia geoffrensis ) , live mostly off fish in the Amazon River basin , with the occasional turtle or crab .
The botos had often seemed to play with items such as sticks or lumps of hard clay , thrashing them against the surface of the water or tossing them with flicks of their heads .
One day scientists noticed that three botos that held objects in their mouths were all adult males .
This prompted speculation that such behavior might not be play at all .
Martin and his colleagues carried out hundreds of subsequent observations of dolphins .
Trying to live and work in the flooded Amazon forest was challenging , with investigators having to overcome things " like the heat and humidity , which destroys electronic equipment ; opacity of the water , which is like milk coffee , you can't see underwater ; and the insects and fungi that busily turn our floating lab home into mush , " he said .
Martin and his colleagues found the overwhelming majority of those who carried items were adult males , which are larger and pinker than females .
" It 's particularly interesting that the complexity of this behavior in these dolphins is considerably greater than that in chimps , " Martin said .
" Chimp males break off branches , thrash them around and make a lot of noise to show off how macho they are — bit like blokes with big motorbikes and Ferraris , I guess .
Botos , however , are much more subtle , and often use their objects in what appears to be a ritualistic way . "
Males typically held objects when there were adult females present .
" This species has a mythical reputation for enchanting and seducing women in Amazon communities , and you could believe that they really are enchanting their own females with this object - carrying behavior , " Martin said .
Aggression among males — such as biting or striking another dolphin with the head or tail — was strongly linked with object - carrying , and perhaps was linked to access to females , the scientists added .
Although the scientists think they saw some females carry objects , " it 's possible some of these ' females ' were actually pre-adult males , because some such males are the same size and color as some adult females , " Martin said .
Even if these were females , " the number of examples of females carrying objects was tiny , and in any animal population you can expect to find some individuals who do things different . "
Martin noted this behavior was found in populations of botos that have probably been geographically isolated from each other for millions of years .
" It is therefore either ancestral to them all and therefore millions of years old or has evolved independently in each case , " Martin said .
" Either way it does appear to be deep - rooted in their behavior and passed from one generation to the next .
Some would argue that this is culture . "
Martin noted that " river dolphins are the most endangered and least understood of all cetaceans , and we are in a race to find out how to conserve them before they all disappear . "
Martin and his colleagues Vera da Silva and Peter Rothery detailed their findings online March 26 in the journal Biology Letters .
Cocaine Jesus statue seized by agents in Laredo Drug dealer 's wait for Jesus denied by federal agents
This statue of Jesus Christ is made from cocaine .
The small statue was seized in Laredo last week after an attempt to smuggle it into the United States .

A drug dealer named The Spider is wondering why his Jesus Christ still has n't appeared in Dallas .
Thanks to an unusual bust by federal agents in Laredo , they 're not going to connect .
Drug traffickers mixed as much as six pounds of the illicit white powder into a paste and used it to make a regal statue of the Christian savior , complete with painted - on flowing hair and a gold cape .
Smugglers were likely hoping the statue , which could be worth as much as $ 30,000 on the streets , would be dismissed by border guards as just another of the hundreds of plaster representations hawked to borderland tourists .
But a dog trained to sniff out drugs confirmed it was anything but another religious memento .
" This seizure shows what extreme measures people will go through to smuggle drugs , " Janice Ayala , second - in - command of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement 's investigative office in Laredo , said Wednesday .
Earlier this week in the Rio Grande Valley , border inspectors found $ 10,000 stuffed into a child 's bulging diaper .
" These people will use anything , including religious icons to smuggle their drugs , " said Steven Robertson , a spokesman for the Drug Enforcement Administration , in Washington .
" It is sacrilegious . "
Robertson said if the statue had been successfully smuggled , it would likely have been broken apart with water , sifted through a strainer and dried before being bagged and sold to users .
Investigators will likely now run chemical tests to determine what percentage of the statue is cocaine as well as the drug 's purity .
There 's no way to know if smugglers routinely use the Jesus statue technique , though Robertson said big - time drug dealers would likely consider it too much work for too little profit .
The plot quietly began to unfold last week when the woman who was a passenger in a car driving into the United States said a man told her he had too many things to carry , and would pay her $ 80 if she 'd drop the statue at the Laredo bus station , according to a court document filed Wednesday .
While trying to enter the United States , Customs and Border Patrol inspectors grew suspicious and checked her out .
The woman later said she was unaware the statue was cocaine and took federal agents along for her rendezvous .
After being arrested , the man , 61 - year - old Bernardino Garcia - Cordova , admitted the statue was his property , authorities said .
Garcia - Cordova , who now faces cocaine importation and possession charges , told investigators a man he knows only by a Spanish nickname , La Araña , or The Spider , told him to take it to Dallas .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. Democratic presidential front - runner Barack Obama got a close - up look at the sort of slash - and - burn politics he has vowed to rise above -- and he did not appear to like the view .
The Illinois senator grimaced in clear discomfort at times in Wednesday night ’s debate as the spotlight shone on issues like Obama ’s fiery pastor , his relationship with a 1960s radical , his remarks about small - town voters and his failure to wear a lapel flag pin .
The debate with Democratic rival Hillary Clinton gave Obama a chance to road test the responses he will need if he captures their party ’s nomination and faces Republican John McCain in what promises to be a tough November presidential election .
“ This was a test for Obama , and I do n’t think he did particularly well .
He is going to have to improve .
He was clearly uncomfortable and looked a little pained by it all , ” said Cal Jillson , a political analyst at Southern Methodist University in Texas .
“ He needs to develop some smooth , confident answers to these issues because he ’s going to hear plenty more of it , ” he said .
Obama was grilled by ABC News moderators about the inflammatory tirades of his former pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah Wright , and about his characterization of small - town residents as clinging to religion and guns in bitterness over their economic struggles .
He also was asked about his failure to wear a flag pin in his lapel , a token of patriotism for some other politicians , and his relationship with William Ayers , a member of the violent leftist Weather Underground group in the 1960s and now a Chicago neighbor .
ABC came under fire for the questioning on Thursday .
Washington
Post television critic Tom Shales called it shoddy and despicable , while the liberal grassroots group MoveOn.org started an online protest petition .
At a rally in North Carolina , which votes on May 6 , Obama said a discussion of health care , Iraq , jobs and gas prices took a backseat to the effort to fire up more controversy in the debate .
He said Clinton seemed “ in her element . ”

“ I know some people were frustrated with last night but the truth is all that was happening was that was the rollout of the Republican campaign against me in November , ” Obama said .
“ It happened just a little bit early but that is what they will do .
They will try to focus on all these issues that do n’t have anything to do with how you are paying your bills at the end of the month , ” he said .
The controversies have popped up in the Democratic presidential race during a seven - week lull between the last round of major contests in Ohio and Texas on March 4 and next week ’s critical showdown in Pennsylvania .
MEDIA , NOT VOTER , INTEREST
Linda Fowler , a political analyst at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire , said the media were more interested than voters in the controversies .
She said polls showed Obama ’s small - town comments , which became public over the weekend , have had little impact .
“ This says more about the media than about the candidates .
If this stuff is so important , why are n’t the polls moving ? ” she said .
Clinton , the New York senator and former first lady who has faced her own campaign gaffes , was glad to join in the examination of Obama during the debate .
She tried to capitalize on Democratic paranoia about the Republican success in attacking the last two Democratic nominees , John Kerry and Al Gore , by arguing the issues Obama faced in the debate are the same type Republicans will try to exploit in November .

“ It goes to this larger set of concerns about how we are going to run against John McCain , ” Clinton said in the debate .
“ I ’ve been in this arena for a long time .
I have a lot of baggage , and everybody has rummaged through it for years . ”
Clinton faces a struggle trying to overtake Obama in the Democratic presidential race .
She trails in delegates to the Denver nominating convention in August and needs a big win in Pennsylvania on Tuesday and a strong closing effort in the last nine contests to position herself to win the nomination .
While her campaign aides have frequently criticized the media for not subjecting Obama to as much scrutiny as Clinton has faced , they were clearly pleased with the debate grilling .
“ In an ideal world , I wish we could conduct our campaigns on questions of policy and policy differentiation .
We ’ve learned that campaigns are about much more than that , ” said Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson .
“ The questions that Senator Obama were asked last night are the kind of questions Senator Obama will face if he is our nominee , ” he said .

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
A production slowdown at the nation 's refineries , now operating at levels last seen in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , could n't come at a more troublesome time for consumers watching pump prices flirt with $ 4 a gallon .
Such low production rates could create a new set of problems for refiners , already operating at the brink of loss .
Utilization rates at 30 - month lows threaten to spark probes by lawmakers , who have been holding a series of hearings on the rampant rise in gasoline and diesel prices .
" If this operating level persists , the industry will likely see another round of intense legislative scrutiny , " said John Kilduff , an analyst at futures brokerage MF Global .
U.S. refineries operated at 81.4 % of their operable capacity in the week ending April 11 , the Energy Department 's statistical arm said last week .
The last time the utilization rate fell below 80 % was in October 2005 after hurricanes Rita and Katrina devastated refineries along the U.S. Gulf Coast .
The culprit is a record run in oil prices , which are rising much faster than gasoline prices .
Near - term crude futures , which hit a new record above $ 117 a barrel Monday , have accelerated 80 % in the last 12 months .
Gasoline futures and retail prices also keep hitting new records .
But the yearly gain of 41 % in gas futures has not been nearly as dramatic .
See more on oil and gas futures .
The gap between the price of crude and the price of gasoline and other refined products has pressured profit margins at refiners Valero Corp.
VLO , - 3.14 % , Tesoro Corp. TSO , and Sunoco Inc. SUN , +0.64 % , among others .
Earnings from downstream operations including refining slumped 62 % for a group of 10 major U.S. oil companies in the fourth quarter .
At the same time , these companies processed roughly the same volume of oil , says the Energy Department 's Energy Information Administration .
“ ' This is a maintenance season .
If you can't make a lot of money , you do a little more repairs . ' ” — James Williams , WTRG Economics
The first quarter is likely to look even worse .
Earnings for the three dedicated refiners in the S&P 500 Index SPX , - 0.48 % are anticipated to tumble 94 % to just under $ 67 million from $ 1.2 billion a year ago , according to Thomson Financial .
A good time for maintenance
With higher costs cutting into their bottom line , refiners appear to have decided that this spring is a particularly opportune time to take more of their production offline and retool their plants .
" This is a maintenance season .
If you can't make a lot of money , you do a little more repairs , " said James Williams , an economist at WTRG Economics , an energy - research firm .
Spring is typically when refiners idle parts of their plants to undertake maintenance .
But they do n't always cut back so drastically .
Last April , when the difference between crude and gasoline prices was narrower , the utilization rate touched 90 % .
The nation 's refinery - utilization rate has remained under 90 % since early January .
Still , analysts anticipate this production rate could pick up again if gasoline - price growth accelerates ahead of the key summer - driving season .
" I expect the rate to go up dramatically , probably passing 90 % in a month , " Williams added .
Already this year , the gap between crude prices and gasoline has narrowed .
Near - term crude futures have risen 22 % this year , while gasoline prices have gained 20 % .
The EIA said last week that gasoline could surpass $ 4 a gallon in the upcoming driving season in some areas .
Retail regular - gas prices averaged $ 3.503 a gallon on Monday , a new record high , according to AAA .
Crunch time for refiners
That improvement wo n't help companies with big refining operations in the upcoming quarterly earnings season .
Chevron Corp. CVX , - 2.74 % , the nation 's second - largest energy company , said earlier this month that its refining operations have been hurt by weak profit margins , although total earnings will likely get a big boost from record - high oil and natural - gas prices .
The company 's downstream segment made up about one - fifth of its total earnings last year .
Valero Energy VLO , - 3.14 % , the United States ' largest refiner , warned last month that sharply lower margins from refining crude means first - quarter profit margins will be " significantly lower " than in the year - ago quarter .
Nonetheless , companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM , - 2.91 % , which makes a big chunk of its profit from oil production , are still expected to report record earnings .
Exxon Mobil last year posted the largest annual profit by a U.S. company -- $ 40.6 billion .
At the same time , Congress continues to prod the oil industry for explanations on high gasoline and diesel prices .
On Thursday , a House panel on energy independence and global warming will hold a hearing on " gas prices and the Strategic Petroleum Reserve . "
Earlier this month , thousands of independent truckers protested high diesel prices as House lawmakers grilled top oil - company executives on tax breaks .
National average diesel prices touched a new high of $ 4.20 a gallon on Monday , AAA said .
National gasoline prices reached a new record of $ 3.503 a gallon , though they have been topping $ 4 in some parts of the country .
Dentists can discover serious health problems
When you have a dentist appointment , you may only be thinking about the health of your teeth .
However , your dentist knows that many health problems can affect your teeth and gums as well .
“ People think we ’re only looking at teeth , ” says Gigi Meinecke , DMD , spokesperson for the Academy of General Dentistry and a dentist in private practice in Potomac , Maryland .
“ But typically we ’re looking at all of the soft tissues in the mouth . ”
This access can allow dentists to identify a number of surprising conditions — from diabetes to GERD ( gastroesophageal reflux disease ) — possibly before you or your doctor are aware of them .
Here are the most common diseases your dentist might be able to detect .
( Here are the 13 things every dentist wants you to know before your next appointment . )
10 Tips For Being A Smart and Safe Consumer
One goal we have when we shop is to be able to save money on the purchases we make .
But we all face the challenge of making sure that when we spend our money , we are also doing so wisely and safely .
Recently , the fallout on product recalls , scams and shoddy workmanship have led to finger pointing , scapegoating , lawsuits and even penalties or imprisonment .
Many of these moves have resulted in better regulations and practices , but ultimately , we share the responsibility for keeping ourselves safe .
We need to be more aware of what it is we buy or whom we hire and try not to get all excited just because something sounds too good to be true .
Our level of awareness begins with asking a few questions : do we really know what kind of product we ’re buying ?
Or who is behind the service we ’re hiring ?
Do we ever bother to give it a second thought ?
That said , here are some basic tips aimed at making us better consumers .
On Merchandise : What Are We Buying ?
# 1 Buy from reputable sources .
Know where the stuff your buying is coming from .
I recall a family member calling me recently to ask about installing software which he apparently picked up from an unknown source .
What I mean by “ unknown ” is that it came from a friend of a friend of a friend from a far flung country .
Though the product was purchased legitimately , I told him that the source is still suspect , and even if it were FREE , I would n’t install it on my machine .
This just begs for potentially bigger problems , the least of which would be a computer crash .
Trojan horses , anyone ?
Incidentally , this family member has already been a handy victim of identity theft ( his SSN was hi-jacked and linked to no less than FIVE foreign - sounding names through his bank ) , so I can only hope that he listens to me .
# 2 Check recall lists .
ConsumerReports.org and other consumer sites are out there telling us what ’s been banned , recalled , pulled from our shelves .
Keep your eyes open for warnings in the mail , online , from your local news and newspapers .
# 3 Keep your eyes open for counterfeits and pirated products .
Knock - offs are cheap and can be dead ringers , but are you sure you know what they ’re made of ?
I wrote a huge post on this earlier on , with some tips on how to protect yourself from fakes you do n’t want in your life .
# 4 Recognize quality .
Do you poke and prod the products you ’re about to buy ?
It may not sound like the most elegant thing to do , but I ’m really talking more about doing what it takes to recognize how well put together a product is .
When I buy food , I scrutinize the ingredients intently , while I look through other items like toys , clothing and other merchandise with a fine tooth comb .
Some people have accused me of being “ OCD ” ( obsessive / compulsive / overly fussy ) but this just means that I ’m performing my role as a safe consumer pretty well .
[ For the record , I do n’t mangle fruit . ;) ]
# 5 Buy local .
This may be a controversial point but it ’s a consideration we should make that goes back to trusting the source of your goods .
This is a personal choice and may not be a matter of black or white .
There are some things you may prefer to get locally while others function spectacularly well as imports .
My basic recommendation here is to see tip # 1 : go by reputation .
On Service : Who Are We Hiring ?
# 1 Use the Better Business Bureau .
Do you know who that is climbing your roof or installing your pipes ?
If you ’ve gone through the yellow pages or spotted an ad somewhere , then unless the ad is from a recognizable company who has a long held reputation , then it may be prudent to dig a little deeper .
Hit the Better Business Bureau ( bbb.org ) from your own county and uncover the secrets behind all the service providers you ’re about to sign up with .
# 2 Check references and credentials .
From my experience , I can say that “ you get what you pay for ” .
One of the toughest things I ’ve experienced as a homeowner is to find really solid tradespeople .
But once you ’ve found them , you cherish your relationship with them since good service people just do n’t grow on trees .
Whether you ’re shopping for a good medical provider , a good school or a good mechanic , just realize that reputation goes a long way , and if you have n’t heard much about somebody or something , then it ’s time to ask for a bit more to back up their glowing stories of their own experience , wisdom and exceptional knowledge .
Ask for and contact their references .
# 3 Get recommendations from people you know .
You can extend this idea by finding , joining or even setting up a local community board for the very purpose of fielding referrals .
I ask around for suggestions from people I know first , before hitting the yellow pages .
There are also some online resources for service recommendations , but my experiences with some of them have been spotty .
# 4 See samples of work and check a service provider ’s online footprint .
Is this someone you can find online ?
Find out whether they ’re signed up on community forums , boards and sites and see what others are saying about them .
I ’m surprised that many people just do n’t perform background evaluations or do n’t even attempt a simple “ google check ” on a particular outfit .
Even quick online checks sometimes yield some amazing information !
Here ’s an example of something you may get out of a local board , where one community member warns of her own negative experience :
We too got taken by this individual who was recommended by [ this guy in cahoots with him ] as being very good and trustworthy .
He started a large job for us and after taking deposits and requesting more money for supplies which he returned we found out and also skipped out on us with the job 25 % done .
Our loss was about $ 50 k not including all the time ( 6 months ) of any excuse under the sun of why he could n’t work .
People , stay far away from these people and their recommendations .
We have suffered so very much because of this !
In this day and age , we end up functioning as our own private investigators just to get some good service .
# 5 Recognize your limitations .
You may be tempted to perform DIY projects to cut costs or even perform as your own general contractor for bigger projects .
Doing so can surely save you good money but when mistakes are made , they can be pretty costly .
Unfortunately , this is one of those things you do n’t realize you cannot do until you make the first harsh mistake .
I can only envy those who have a knack for this sort of thing .
-ooOoo -
In summary , weigh your risks before making any choices .
Take a moment to read , research and study where you ’re committing your money to .
Just because stuff is cheap does n’t mean it rules .

Recession got you down ?
Not to worry .
Any day now , everyone who filed a tax return and earned less than $ 75,000 last year can look forward to some extra cash .
The Bush administration put the first recession - special tax rebate checks in the mail , just in time to save our failing economy .
Or not .
Food and gasoline prices are on the rise .
Home prices are crashing .
Our economy has been shedding jobs consistently since January .
Not surprisingly , the Federal Reserve came out with a study last week showing that personal debt -- that is , not including mortgages -- rose a sharp $ 15.3 billion in March , hitting an all - time high of $ 2.6 trillion .
Given all this , Bush ’s rebate consolation prize is n’t doing much to console me or , I doubt , anyone else of my generation .
I ’m a gainfully employed 27 - year - old , and I use my credit card to buy food because I only have $ 12 in my bank account .
I fear getting sick -- not because I do n’t have insurance but because I could n’t afford the co-pays and deductible .
It ’s hard for me to see how an extra $ 300 or $ 600 is really going to be , as Bush promised , “ a shot in the arm to keep a fundamentally strong economy healthy . ”
Someone please tell me , are these rebates going to do anything more than help us pay off our credit card bills ?

Americans 25 to 34 carry more debt than any other generation in history .
According to the public policy research institute Demos , college graduates leave school with about $ 20,000 in student loans .
We also have more credit card debt : $ 4,358 on average , 47 % higher than young people in 1989 .
Our job security is way down too , with an increasing number of us being hired for “ temp ” jobs instead of as full - time employees .
Whatever the bosses call it -- “ perma - lancer , ” “ independent contractor ” -- it translates the same : long hours with no benefits and no severance when they let you go .
Trust me , working three jobs without benefits is only romantic for a year or two .
After that it ’s scary .
And it ’s not just me charging my milk and eggs ; 45 % of Americans 34 and under use a credit card for basic necessities such as rent and groceries .
Perhaps I ’m being too cynical .
Economies go through ups and downs .
Maybe these tax rebates actually will help .
Or at least , maybe we ’ve already hit rock bottom and have nowhere to go but up .
But to my untrained eye , the problem appears to have surpassed the point at which even a $ 153 - billion package -- a tiny fraction of what American consumers owe in personal debt -- can save us .
The secure , full - time jobs with benefits that once kept people my age afloat , that created the financial security to settle down and start families , are evaporating .
In the meantime , our government is cutting basic social services while charging up its own deficit on corporate tax breaks , a couple of wars and , yes , even by sending millions of us a few hundred dollars in tax rebates .

Sure , the extra cash is nice -- maybe I can get American Express off my back about those late fees -- but where ’s the long - term solution ?
I , like a good number of people in my generation , live paycheck to paycheck .
If I lose my job or face a medical disaster , what safety net is going to catch me ?
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Oil prices settled at a record high for the third day in a row on Wednesday .
Prices spiked to a record $ 115.07 a barrel in midday trading , after a government report showed an unexpected crude supply drop .
U.S. light sweet crude for May delivery settled at $ 114.93 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
In the short term , momentum could push crude prices higher still , according to Brian Hicks , co-manager of the Global Resources Fund at U.S. Global Investors .
However , Hicks says , " at some point , seasonal factors will come into play and we will see a pullback in the second quarter . "
There is lower demand for crude in the second quarter because consumers are in between the winter heating months and the summer driving months .
Crude began the year at just under $ 96 a barrel , which means the price has soared by nearly 20 % already this year .
In its weekly inventory report , the Energy Information Administration said crude stocks fell by 2.3 million barrels in the week ended April 11 .
Analysts had been expecting an increase of 1.7 million barrels after last week 's unexpected drop , according to a Dow Jones poll .
Refining gasoline
Oil 's above - $ 100 run has been attributed by many economists to the decline in value of the dollar and poorly performing stock markets .
Investors buy commodities such as crude oil and gold to preserve the value of their assets .
The dollar sank to a new low versus the 15 - nation euro Wednesday as a government report showed the number of new residential construction projects fell to its lowest level in 17 - years
Refineries only operated at 81.4 % capacity , EIA said , down from a normal rate of around 90 % this time of year .
That led one analyst to blame the brief oil retreat on slowing demand for crude .
" Why do we need crude supplies ? " said Phil Flynn , senior market analyst with Alaron Trading in Chicago .
" People are starting to look at these [ inventory ] numbers in a different way . "
Refineries are using less crude because , with oil prices at record highs , it now costs more to make gasoline .
" Prices of gasoline have n't gone up in sync with crude oil , " said Mark Waggoner , president of Excel Futures in California .
With refineries operating at low rates , gasoline production last week fell .
The EIA said gasoline supplies fell by 5.5 million barrels .
Analysts had only expected a drop of 1.7 million barrels .
Oil prices have risen about 77 % over the last year , and have set new record highs over the last few months .
Slowing demand
Gasoline prices have also risen along with crude , although not as fast .
According to AAA gasoline prices hit a new record of $ 3.399 , up one and three tenths of a cent from the previous day 's price of $ 3.386 .
The high prices have crimped demand for gas .
EIA said gasoline demand rose 0.8 % over the last four weeks .
" Usually you would expect [ demand ] growth of 1.4 % to 2 % , " said Flynn .
" What we 're seeing is price - related demand destruction . "
Refineries have greater incentive to produce distillates , a vital component of diesel fuel , since the price of diesel at the pump has been rising much faster than gasoline .
Distillate supplies rose by 100,000 barrels , according to the EIA .
Analysts expected a decline of 1.5 million barrels .

Explanation : The Television InfraRed Observational Satellite ( TIROS ) 1 was the first weather satellite .
Launched into a polar orbit 40 years ago ( April 1 , 1960 ) equipped with two TV cameras , TIROS 1 was operational for only 78 days but demonstrated the feasibility of monitoring planet Earth 's cloud cover and weather patterns from space .
TIROS satellites eventually began continuous coverage in 1962 and enabled accurate worldwide weather forecasts and alerts .
Above is the first TIROS TV image , taken from an altitude of about 700 kilometers .
Crude by contemporary standards , it represents the beginning of what is still one of the most important continuing applications of space technology .
The government 's attempts to placate Muslims will cause long - term damage to communities , a charity said yesterday .
The warning came from Yasmin Alibhai - Brown , chair and co-founder of the British Muslims for Secular Democracy , a new organisation claiming to represent the " silent majority who feel no conflict between their faith and democracy " .
Speaking before the launch , attended by Baroness Kishwer Faulkner and former Islamist Ed Husain , the journalist said the government was pandering to Muslims by granting too many concessions , fuelling their separation from the rest of society .
" The government has found a way of placating Muslims in a way that will only damage us in the long term , Muslims wanting separate schools or different measures .
There must be one law for all .
" This differential accommodation leads to us being pushed to the edges .
How is it that the Sikhs and Hindus can live in democracy but not Muslims ? "
She added : " The perception is that Muslims receive a disproportionate amount of attention and funding and that perception is justified .
This ridiculous , distorted , exaggerated single identity has made us no friends . "
The group cited an IPSOS Mori review of surveys , conducted since 2005 , that revealed most British Muslims believed their faith to be compatible with democracy .
The group 's projects include publishing a booklet for teachers on how to negotiate with Muslim parents who ask for special treatment and citizenship workshops .
More than 60 crimes can carry the death penalty in China The Chinese authorities put to death at least 470 people last year , but probably killed many more , human rights group Amnesty International has said .
Amnesty said the hidden extent of executions in China , where figures are secret , might mean the Olympic host was behind the bulk of them worldwide .
But China 's foreign ministry defended the death penalty , saying China limited it to a small number of criminals .
At least 1,252 people are known to have been executed in 24 countries in 2007 .
Just five countries - China , Iran , Saudi Arabia , Pakistan and the US - were responsible for 88 % of known executions in the world , Amnesty said .
About 3,347 people were sentenced to death in 51 nations last year and up to 27,500 people are now estimated to be on death row .
Swift justice
In its annual report on the death penalty , Amnesty International said China had executed more than any country last year .
While there were 470 confirmed executions , the real figure was likely to run into thousands , Amnesty said .
" As the world 's biggest executioner , China gets the ' gold medal ' for global executions , " said the organisation 's UK director , Kate Allen .
Many governments claim that executions take place with public support - people therefore have a right to know what is being done in their name
Amnesty International
More than 60 crimes can carry the death penalty in China , including tax fraud , stealing VAT receipts , damaging electric power facilities , selling counterfeit medicine , embezzlement , accepting bribes and drug offences , Amnesty said .
Those sentenced to death are usually shot , but some provinces are introducing lethal injections , which the government says is more humane .
The BBC's Quentin Sommerville , in Beijing , says justice is usually swift - most of those sentenced to death are executed only weeks after they are found guilty .
GLOBAL EXECUTIONS IN 2007 Minimum of 1,252 people were executed in 24 countries
At least 3,347 sentenced to death in more than 50 countries Up to 27,500 on death row China : at least 470 , many more estimated Iran : at least 317 people Saudi Arabia : at least 143 , Pakistan : at least 135 USA : 42 In a statement responding to the Amnesty report , Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang
Yu said : " The conditions are not right in China to abolish the death penalty , and would not be supported by the majority of the people . "
" We severely control and cautiously use it , to ensure that it is only used in a small minority of the most serious cases . "
The Chinese government has recently attempted to reform the system .
Last year , it decreed that all cases involving the death penalty had to be referred to the Supreme Court .
According to state media , this led to a 10 % fall in executions in the first five months of 2007 .
Amnesty urged the International Olympic Committee and athletes to press for greater openness about executions during the Olympic Games in Beijing this August .
" The secretive use of the death penalty must stop : the veil of secrecy surrounding the death penalty must be lifted , " it added .
" Many governments claim that executions take place with public support .
People therefore have a right to know what is being done in their name . "
UN resolution Iran was second to China with 317 known executions during 2007 , the report said , followed by Saudi Arabia on 143 , Pakistan on 135 and the US on 42 .
Amnesty said the totals had risen alarmingly in Iran , Saudi Arabia and Pakistan , but that worldwide they showed a drop - down to 1,252 from 1,591 the previous year .
Iran was second to China , with 317 known executions in 2007
The executions in Iran included the stoning to death of a man for adultery , and the execution of three people who were teenagers aged between 13 and 16 at the time of their arrests , it added .
In Saudi Arabia , those killed included a child offender aged 15 or 16 at the time of his detention , and an Egyptian man who was beheaded for " sorcery " and adultery - one of at least 76 foreigners executed by the Gulf kingdom .
Despite the statistics , Amnesty welcomed the wider trend toward the global abolition of the death penalty , noting that in December 2007 the UN General Assembly had voted by a large majority in favour of a resolution calling for an end to capital punishment .
" The taking of life by the state is one of the most drastic acts a government can undertake .
We are urging all governments to follow the commitments made at the UN and abolish the death penalty once and for all , " it added .

What are these ?
Smoking pot , even long - term , is not associated with an increased risk of developing cancers of the head and neck , according to the results of a just - published case - control study from New Zealand .
“ This population - based study did not find a statistically significant increase in the risk of head and neck cancer in adults [ under age 55 ] from cannabis , ” authors concluded .
“ [ Even ] the risk associated with the highest tertile of cannabis use ( defined as one joint per day for more than eight years ) was not statistically significant after adjustment for cofounding variables including tobacco smoking , alcohol consumption , and level of income . ”
So for the second month in a row we have researchers from New Zealand telling us that pot smoking has little - to - no association with cancer .
But perhaps you missed the first study .
That would be understandable because the mainstream media deliberately obscured its findings with alarmist headlines like “ Cannabis Bigger Cancer Risk Than Cigarettes ” and “ Experts Warn of Cannabis Cancer ‘ Epidemic ’ ” — headlines that , in fact , were nearly the opposite of what the study actually said .
So now we come to this latest report — written by the same investigative team and involving almost the same number of subjects .
Anyone think that the mainstream press will jump on the “ pot is n’t linked to cancer ” bandwagon ?
I ’m not holding my breath .

The full Penney Report ( 1947 )
Penney and the Start of the Post - War British Atomic Bomb Program
William G. Penney , the father of the British atom bomb , spent most of 1944 and 1945 at Los Alamos helping the United States build the first atomic bomb .
He formed part of the British Mission , an elite team of Los Alamos British scientists and emigres who contributed to the development , testing and use of atomic weapons .
Penney , sent to Los Alamos as a specialist on ocean waves , soon found his gifts were readily apparent and he was made one of the five members of the Los Alamos " brain trust " .
The group made key decisions in the direction of the weapons program , putting him in the company of Robert Oppenheimer , John Von Neumann , " Deke " Parsons and Norman Ramsey .
On 27 April 1945
Penney became one of only two representatives from Los Alamos ( and the only Briton ) to be part of the ten man Target Committee responsible for drawing up a list of prospective Japanese atomic bomb sites .
Penney travelled to Tinian Island in the Pacific to be on hand for planning and briefing the atomic bombing missions .
Penney actually witnessed the bombing of Nagasaki , flying in an observation plane accompanying the attack .
Afterwards he conducted damage surveys of the ruined city .
Penney returned to Imperial College immediately after the war , but accepted an appointment to head up the Armament Research Department ( ARD ) on 1 January 1946 .
On 8 January 1947 the secret GEN.163 Cabinet committee of six Ministers ( headed by PM Attlee ) decided to proceed with a British effort to acquire atomic weapons .
Penney did not receive word of this decision until May 1947 when he was finally asked by Lord Portal to lead the British effort .
The decision was not disclosed publicly in any respect until 12 May 1948 , when an oblique reference was made to atomic weapon development in British parliamentary discussions .
In June 1947 Penney began assembling a team to work on the bomb .
One of his first steps was to prepare a document describing the features of the U.S. plutonium implosion bomb , breaking down the development tasks required to replicate it , and identifying outstanding questions that required further research .
The report , completed on 1 July , was entitled " Plutonium Weapon - General Description " ( U.K , Public Record Office File AVIA 65/1163 , " Implosion " ) and gave the British atomic weapons program a preliminary design description roughly equivalent in terms of detail to the description provided the Soviets by Klaus Fuchs .
The Penney Report
The Penney Report was declassified and made physically available at an unknown date , thought to be in the late 1990s , under the Public Records Act ( now amended by the Freedom of Information Act which came into force in January 2005 ) .
However file ( covering the years 1947 - 1953 ) was withdrawn from public access during 2002 , possibly due to political sensitivities after the September 2001 terrorist attacks in New York .
It was not scheduled for access again until 2014 .
The actual legal status of the file remains as a public record .
Its access condition has been changed to " Retained by Department under Section 3.4 " ( of the PRA ) which means that the file has been returned to the custody of the originating department ( Ministry of Supply ) or its successor .
This limitation of access does not constitute reimposition of a secret security marking , and no attempt appears to have been made by the U.K. government to contact people who had previously obtained photocopies copies of this file , until the document appeared on Wikileaks .
On March 19 , 2008 , the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office , Counter Proliferation Department wrote to Wikileaks asking that the " Fat Man " bomb diagram , which was released by Wikileaks before the full report , be removed .
However , after some discussion , Wikileaks did not find the request credible and did not comply .
See United Kingdom atomic weapons program : The full Penney Report ( 1947 ) for the full correspondence .
Penney 's description is reportedly less detailed than " Tuck 's Bible " , which was written around this same time by James Tuck , another member of the British Mission to Los Alamos who was deeply involved in the design and development of the implosion bomb and wrote appendix ' M ' to the Penney Report which compares the British and United States weapons programs .
Tuck 's Bible has never been made public .
A brief analysis of the “ Fat Man ” diagram
1. Neutron Initiator
Polonium is a well known alpha radiation emitter .
Alpha radiation is
He atoms stripped of electrons and accelerated towards c .
When polonium crushed onto beryllium by explosion , reaction occurs between polonium alpha emissions and beryllium leading to Carbon - 12 & 1 neutron .
This , in practice , would lead to a predictable neutron flux , sufficient to set off device .
Widely known that once critical mass is obtained , in order for bomb to explode , requires fission initiation by neutron generation ; this will do the trick .
Polonium 210 specifically well known alpha emitter .
Gold / nickel foil layer around beryllium is sufficient to prevent pre-reaction prior to explosive compression due to low penetrability of alpha radiation ( ca n’t pass through paper ) .
This allows for long - term storage of initiator .
The Boron - 10 shielding is to keep stray ( eg cosmic ray generated ) neutrons from pre-initiating the chain reaction .
The polonium in the initiator has a short , half - year halflife .
The inner layer of the Be sphere is etched with grooves , these will create
Be jets when imploded ( shaped charge effect ) which mixes the Be and Po very quickly .
2. Diagram
Roughly to scale .
No easy feat in days prior to computerized drafting tools .
Measurements located on table in top left roughly match drawing scale .
Note archaic units ( lbs ) : physicists after ‘ 50s probably would have used SI units , regardless of country .
Also note quality of arcs ( Fast HE / Slow HE ) indicates is drawn by professional draftsman .
3. High Explosives & Miznay / Schardin effect ( e.g. shaped charge )
Miznay / Schardin effect will work in this design , in all likelihood , though the additional layer of HE after the first layer of lenses is a surprise .
Are the lenses strong enough to compress the second layer of HE ?
In any event , there ’s enough explosive in there to cause the Miznay / Schardin effect , and enough aluminum to convincingly crush the core .
The outer layer of slow + fast explosives is used to create a number of converging planar shock wavefronts .
The inner layer of solid HE is not compressed , but is initiated fairly uniformly by the many planar wavefronts hitting it .
The uniformity of initiation is important to the compression of the core .
Also note the squiggly lines indicating compression .
Note also the “ possibilities table ” in the bottom left .
This indicates several possibilities as to how much explosive is necessary , indicating that the design is not yet fixed .
4. Weaponization .
The weapon has a removable core , or at least a serviceable one , as evidenced by felt layers .
This is necessary to allow the bomb to be disassembled .
5. Assessment .
This diagram is not really a secret to foreign intelligence services ; nobody is going to be surprised by this design , just by the fact that it ’s appeared in public .
Open sources have speculated on these matters for a long time ( see nuclear weapons design article in Wikipedia ) , and this just confirms that they were right .
This is a crude , but effective , plutonium based design .
Devices that are orders of magnitude more efficient are possible .
A disclosure of , for example , the plans of the W - 88 or a Russian equivalent , would be far more threatening , as there are actually real secrets involved there not known to all the NWS ( the Big - 5 + India , Pakistan , Israel , North Korea ) or Virtual NWS ( Germany , Japan , Sweden , South Korea , Canada , Ukraine , Taiwan , Italy , Spain … to name a few ) intelligence agencies .
After 1949 or so , disclosure of this would not have been a real threat to U.S. national security .
The real problem about building one of these designs is the rarity ( at least outside of NWS nuclear facilities ) of plutonium and polonium , as well as the ability to fabricate sophisticated high explosives to exacting specifications .
We ’re not talking about IEDs here .
To build a nuclear weapon requires a state .
Text version of AVIA file 65 , " Implosion " , by Williom G. Penney , 1 July 1947
Plutonium Weapon - General Description .
I ntroduction .
The following general description of the plutonium weapon has been compiled with the object of anticipating difficulties in experimentation , design , and manufacture , so that the progress of development may run concurrently .
Of necessity , the description can only give an overall picture and does not profess scientific or technical detail .
C omponents Of The Weapon .
2 . The components may be divided into seven separate assemblies consisting
( a) The imploder system .
( b) The plutonium core .
( c) The initiator .
(d) The casing of the explosive assembly .
(e) The detonator firing mechanism .
( f) The proximity fusing device .
(g) The ballistic outer casing .
Although the imploder system is shewn above as one assembly , it is , in fact , a multiple assembly having the following components .
( a) The detonators .
b) The outer composite H.E. shell .
( c) The inner homogeneous H.E. shell .
(d) The aluminium inner liner .
(e) The boron 10 shield .
( f) The uranium 238 tamper .
In addition to those components , there is also a thin felt washer between the homogeneous explosive and the aluminium liner in order to take up manufacturing inaccuracies .
3 . The main object of this somewhat complicated imploder system is to ensure that the detonation waves initiated by the detonators arrive at the main plutonium core as one concentric converging shack waves without ' jets '.
4 . A sectional schematic drawing approximately to scale is attached and each component is briefly described in the appendices listed below :
Appendix ' A '. The Detonator System .
Appendix ' B '.
The Outer Composite H.E. Shell .
Appendix ' C '. The Inner H. E. Shell .
Appendix ' D '. The Aluminium Liner .
Appendix 'E ' The Boron 10 Shield .
Appendix ' F '. The Uranium 238 Liner .
Appendix ' G '. The Plutonium Core .
Appendix ' H ' The Initiator .
Appendix ' I ' The Casing and Explosive Assembly .
Appendix 'J ' Firing Mechanism and Proximity Fusing Device
Appendix ' K ' The Ballistic Outer Casing .
Appendix 'L ' The Arming Plug .
Appendix 'M ' Tabulated Notes prepared by Dr. Tuck .
5 . Although production of plutonium cores must be on a limited scale in the first instance , consideration must be given to the total number of bombs likely to be required as this may affect manufacturing processes of components i.e. a limited number hand - made or in sufficient number to justify special presses , moulds , etc .
A ppendix ' A '
T he Detonator System
I nitiation Of Detonation .
There are 32 points of initiation of detonation around the surface of the H.E. outer shell .
Each detonator is in fact a twin system to ensure against failure .
DESCRIPTION .
Each detonator is of the " fuse - bridge " type , the wire bridge being imbedded in a small quantity of PETN ( Pentelite ) and having a tetryl booster .
STANDARD OF ACCURACY
The whole bridge system from bridge to booster must be accurate to within 0.2 microseconds to ensure subsequent concentricity of the detonation wave .
MANUFACTURING PROBLEMS .
The main manufacturing problems are the consistency of the pentelite and tetryl as well as the characteristics of the bridge to ensure this high order of timing accuracy .
DISCUSSION .
When facilities are complete , C.S.A.R. will be able to undertake all research , experimentation , design and production .
QUESTIONS AS AT 1.7.194 .
Nil , pending further progress with preliminary research .
A ppendix ' B '
T he Outer Composite H.E. Shell .
OBJECT .
A detonation wave initiated in a H.E. progresses spherically outwards but as it is essential for the implosion wave to arrive as a convergent sphere , some mechanical mean is required to convert the former type into the latter , and this is the main function of the outer H.E. shell .
DESCRIPTION .
The shell consists of 20 hexagonal and 12 pentagonal uncased H.E. lenses , each being a truncated pyramid about 8 " high , and having an external radius of about 27 " .
Each lens comprises a composite filling , the outer being 60 / 40 RDX / TNT having a relatively high rate of detonation , and the inner being BARITOL having a slower rate of detonation .
Other explosives may be used as a result of experimentation .
The size and shape of the inner cavity , which contains the Baronal ( sic Baritol ? ) ,
Is governed by the relative rates of detonation as it is in this assembly that the conversion mentioned in paragraph 1 above is effected .
Pockets to accommodate the detonators are provided on the outer surface of the sphere , their relative positions being determined by the need for symmetrical initiation .
D esign And Manufacturing Problems .
( a) Developing the technique of producing consistent RDX / TNT , and Baronal , or other similar explosives .
( b) Accurate determination of rates of detonation of the intended explosives .
( c) Size and shape of the cavity containing the slower explosive .
( d ) the method of pressing the fast explosive in the first instance , and then the slow explosive into the cavity to obtain consistency of detonation and avoidance of jet action .
(e) Accurate shaping of the sections to ensure face - contact .
ASSOCIATED PROBLEMS .
( a) Variations in temperature during storage or carriage affect the density of explosive and thus vary the rate of detonation .
( b) Design of containers for transport so that the sections do not become chipped , flaked , cracked or distorted .
DISCUSSION .
When facilities are complete , C.S.A.R. will be able to undertake all research , experimentation , design and production .
QUESTIONS AS AT 1.7.1947
Nil , pending further research .
A ppendix ' C '
T he Inner H.E. Shell .
OBJECT .
To produce the initial implosive effect on to the main core .
As the detonation wave is initiated over the whole outer surface of this component through the medium of the outer shell , it will travel through the inner shell as a convergent wave .
DESCRIPTION .
The shell is composed of segments approximately 9 " thick of RDX / TNT .
DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING PROBLEMS .
As with the outer shell , consistency throughout this component is essential as is the flush fitting of all faces .
Note .
On the inner face of this component is a felt lining approximately 0.15 " thick ; the object is to take up manufacturing irregularities but as it is a minor component , a separate appendix is not justified .
DISCUSSION .
When facilities are complete , C.S.A.R. will be able to undertake all research , experimentation , design and production .
QUESTIONS AS AT 1.7.194 .
Nil , pending further research .
A ppendix ' D ' .
T he Aluminium Liner .
OBJECT .
The main object of this liner is to smooth out any irregularities or jet proclivities in the convergent detonation wave .
DESCRIPTION .
2 . It is a hollow sphere about 4 ½ " thick .
DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING PROBLEMS .
3 . The manufacture of this component is relatively simple .
It will probably be made in two hemispheres screwed together but the faces at the joints must be flush .
DISCUSSION .
C.S.A.R. would be able to produce this component within his resources , but , in order to relieve his workshops of unnecessary work , it may be advisable to put this component to the trade .
QUESTIONS AS AT 1.7.194.7 .
5 . If only limited numbers are required , they could be turned out from the solid , but , if otherwise , pressings or moulds will be necessary .
What should be the policy in this respect ?
A ppendix ' E '
B oron 10 Liner .
OBJECT .
To prevent " rogue " neutrons from outside sources entering the core and initiator assemblies ,
DESCRIPTION .
2. Consists of a hollow sphere having a thickness of approximately 0.125 " .
DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING PROBLEMS .
3. Nil .
DISCUSSION .
In view of the limited numbers required , it may be unnecessary to go to the expense of making dies for this pressing ; therefore , hand manufacture may be preferable .
5 . It may be advisable to give this work to the trade .
QUESTIONS AS AT 1.7.l947 .
6. Opinion seems to be divided on the necessity for this component ; therefore , is further research required to establish the need .
7 . If found necessary , are any special measures required in connection with boron chemistry , extraction and manufacture ?
A ppendix ' F ' .
T he Uranium 238 Liner .
OBJECT .
The object of this liner is fourfold .
(a) To convert the detonation shock wave into an impulse .
( b) To smooth out any remaining irregularities in the wave .
( c) To act as a reflector of neutrons during fission .
(d) To act as a " container " to the plutonium during fission and thus prevent premature disruption of the plutonium core .
DESCRIPTION .
2. A hollow sphere having a thickness of approximately 2 ½ " .
DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING PROBLEMS .
3 . In all probability this shell would be made in two hemispheres and no manufacturing difficulties are anticipated except possibly the means of fastening them together .
DISCUSSION .
4. C.S.A.R. could undertake the manufacture of this component .
QUESTIONS AS AT 1.7.1947 .
5 . According to the numbers required , should the liner be handmade or will pressings be necessary ?
A ppendix ' G '
T he Plutonium Core .
OBJECT .
The main fissile material .
DESCRIPTION .
2 . The core consists of a hollow sphere approximately 2 " thick of a plutonium / gallium alloy .
The proportion of gallium is of the order of 3 atoms per cent .
DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING PROBLEMS .
3 . Very little is known concerning plutonium chemistry in this country nor the machining or processing of the element .
4 . It is believed that the method of manufacture of the hollow hemispheres was done by hot pressing ; but the method of finishing the inner faces and bolting the hemispheres together is uncertain .
5. Appropriate precautions against radioactivity will have to be taken throughout manufacture .
Associated Problems .
6. Suitable containers for storage and transport .
DISCUSSION .
7 . No facilities exist for the handling or fashioning of plutonium ; nor has a technique been developed in this country .
8 . The question arises where a plutonium workshop should be erected .
The alternatives are at Springfield , Harwell , or within C.S.A.R. 's organisation .
There are advantages or disadvantages on each of these alternatives , but , whichever be selected , early consideration must be given to the design and erection of the plant and to getting the appropriate nucleus of the staff considering the problem .
9 . The team engaged on manufacture of this item must have developed their processes to a high order of perfection by the time plutonium is available in adequate quantity ; therefore , early consideration must be given to this problem .
QUESTIONS AS AT l.7.l947 .
10 .
What facilities are required for research into and final production of this component .
11 . Where should they be located .
12 . Have we the competent staff within our resources or will it be necessary .
A ppendix ' H '
T he Initiator .
OBJECT .
To ensure the release of sufficient neutrons to initiate fission , by the admixture of Beryllium and Polonium .
2 . The initiator consists of two main components .
3 . The outer component is a hollow beryllium sphere 1 cm. diameter having the inner face serrated by four - sided 60o pyramids .
4 . Inside this cone is another sphere of beryllium which is centred by means of radial pins projecting internally from the outer shell .
5 . Both the inner serrated surface of the outer shell and the surface of the inner sphere are coated with nickel or gold , or possibly both .
On top of the nickel deposit of the inner sphere a film of polonium is deposited .
Thus , the nickel deposit acts as an " insulator " to prevent neutron reaction between the beryllium and polonium until the appropriate time .
6 . The serrations on the inner surface convert the shock wave into a multitude of jet actions which thus ensure complete shattering and mixture of the two elements , thus causing neutron emission .
DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING PROBLEMS .
7 . The main difficulty is our lack of knowledge of polonium chemistry and considerable research will no doubt be required on this aspect of the project .
8 . As with the other assemblies , the method of the manufacture of the beryllium outer shell and bolting the two hemispheres together requires development .
DISCUSSION .
9 . The design and manufacture of this component also calls for techniques new to this country .
It is estimated that a nucleus staff of one engineer and .
a chemist will require a year deliberating on the problem before they could start to tackle it .
10 .
In addition , plant will be required for the fabrication and this should be ordered in good time .
11 . The location of this plant is also debatable , the alternatives being similar to that for the plutonium core .
QUESTIONS AS AT 1.7.1947 .
12 . What facilities are required for research into and final production of this component .
13 .
Where should they be located .
14 .
Have we the competent staff within our resources or will it be necessary to recruit from outside .
Important footnote .
The half life of the initiator is approximately six months ; therefore , replacements will have to be continuously provided .
A ppendix ' I '
T he Casing For Explosive Assembly .
OBJECT .
The object or this component is to held the whole explosive and fissile assembly solidly together .
DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING PROBLEMS .
Little is known concerning the method used in previous models , but , all probability it consists of the aluminium shell about ½ " thick having separate polar , caps and equatorial sections .
The various sections would have to be bolted together as assembly of the bomb progresses .
3 . As some mention has been made in various reports concerning the effect of temperature changes during flight , it is questionable whether internal or external lagging should be incorporated to prevent heat loss .
4 . Owing to the difficulty of ensuring that the holes in this casing for the detonators coincide with the detonator sockets of the lenses , enlarged holes in the former must be provided with " floating seals " having holes of the right size , superimposed .
5 . Owing to the limited number of weapons envisaged , it is questionable whether the cost of making presses for this casing would be justified and whether hand manufacture should not be undertaken in the same way that the early parabolic reflectors for radar were handmade to a high degree of accuracy .
If presses or moulds have to be made , early consideration of their design will be necessary , and it might be advisable to think in terms of plastics rather than metal .
DISCUSSION .
6 . As with the aluminium liner , the fabrication of the casing is a straightforward metal - working job and could probably be put to the trade .
QUESTIONS AS AT 1.7.1914 .
7 . According to the numbers required , should they be handmade or machine fabricated .
8 . Should the job be put to the trade ?
A ppendix ' J ' .
F iring Mechanism And Proximity Fusing Device .
Whereas the firing mechanism may be relatively simple and standard components could b .
used , the proximity fusing device will call for considerable research and experiment .
</ p>
2. C.S.A.R. visualises that such a fuse must have the following characteristics : .
( a) Selective fusing between 1500 feet and 100 feet above the target .
( b) Accuracy to within + or - 200 feet at the greater height but + or - 30 feet at the lesser .</ p>
( c) Probability of failure reduced to the minimum .
(d) Immunity from jambing or from other interferences .
DISCUSSION .
The fulfilment of this requirement will be a major task for the Electronics Section and will finally necessitate air trials , but these might be incorporated with the normal ballistic trials if the fuses are completed in time .
4 . No doubt T.R.E. could undertake the research into and design of the proximity fuse but it is for discussion whether it would not be preferable to detach personnel from that Establishment to work under the direct supervision of C.S.A.R .
QUESTIONS AS AT l.7.l947 .
5 . Who should undertake this research and where should it be located .
6 . What is the earliest date on which it should start .
A ppendix ' K ' .
T he Ballistic Outer Casing .
The design of this component must also wait until the general overall assembly has been decided upon , but it would also house the firing and fusing mechanisms .
DISCUSSION .
2 . The design of the ballistic casing would primarily concern the bomb design section at R. A. E. , but it would be preferable for personnel from that Establishment to be loaned to C.S.A.R. during the design period , which would cover the ballistic trials .
3 . The manufacture of the casing should be put to the trade , and orders for 2 - or - 3O0 given .
Some of these cases will have to be innered [ crossed out : handwritten above ?inert ] filled for ballistic trials whilst others will be required for fuse functioning tests .
QUESTIONS AS AT l.7.1947 .
4 . As a large number of these outer casings will be required for ballistic trials , is it agreed that the trade should undertake manufacture .
5 . Should the design team work at R.A.E. or be attached to C.S.A.R..
6 . When should work start on this component ?
A ppendix ' L '
T he Arming Plug .
The weapon is assembled component by component , the last being the plutonium pore into which the initiator has already been inserted .
It therefore follows that a passage has to be provided through which the core can be entered , the passage being finally sealed .
2. Starting from the inside of the assembly , a hole of the proper dimensions is cut in the uranium tamper , the boron shield , and the aluminium liner .
3 . In the H.E. component , a section of the inner H.E. shell corresponding to the dimensions of a complete lens is also removed .
4 . After the insertion of the plutonium core , these plugs are replaced , thus sealing the assembly .
In all cases , f1ush fitting of the plugs in their respective sockets must be guaranteed .

Review of G production problem J.L.T. May 1947
Note : G is probably for Gadget , the first U.S. nuclear device ( C. Sublette ) .
The Victoria & Albert Museum in London is hosting an exhibition of high - fashion hearing aids , called Hearwear , in a bid to rehabilitate the devices and make them seem more attractive to those who might need them .
The exhibition , supported by the Royal National Institute for Deaf People ( RNID ) , will showcase a range of designs , from more attractively designed hearing aids to devices that could be used by anyone to play around with sound , the BBC reports .
The exhibition , which opens this week , will include a concept called Goldfish .
It records and can replay the last 10 seconds of a conversation , in case the wearer misses a person 's name when they are introduced .
It also includes hearing aids that have been designed to look like jewellery or gadgets , a device for blocking out annoying sounds , and another to reduce background noise .
The RNID 's chief executive , John Low , says that it is time for more investment in the consumer appeal of hearing aids .
" Millions of people who could benefit from wearing a hearing aid or hearing protection are reluctant to do so , " he told the BBC .
" There has been an incredible revolution is the design of glasses , why not in hearing aids ? "
The RNID says hearing loss will become a significant health issue in the future .
It expects the number of people dealing with some level of impaired hearing will rise from the current one - in - seven , because of increased noise pollution , and increasing life expectancy .
The exhibition opens this week and will run until March 2006 . ®
