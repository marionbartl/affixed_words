Is Linux and open source software really more ' secure ' than commercial software products ?
Maybe , yet maybe not .
The US Dept. of Homeland Security and two research partners have now detected significant flaws in Samba , Python , Perl , and about 180 other open source projects -- but fixes are on the way .
Although some have claimed that Linux and other open source projects are more " secure " than commercial software , a bug - finding program sponsored by the US Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) has now discovered significant flaws in 180 different open source software projects .
Conducted for the DHS by Coverity and Stanford University , the DHS's Open Source Hardening Project has been analyzing code for potential security vulnerabilities and quality defects in 250 different open source projects since 2006 .

The 250 projects analyzed produce some of the world 's most popular open source applications , including the Linux operating system ; the Apache Web Server ; the Firefox Web browser ; and Samba , an open source implementation of Server Message Block ( SMB ) , a protocol used by Microsoft Windows for file and print services .
One of the reasons why open source software is sometimes viewed as more secure is that the code is created by teams of developers from multiple organizations -- some of them volunteers -- who work collaboratively , sharing applications and bug fixes .
Nevertheless , out of the 180 projects found by Coverity to have significant defects , only 11 of them have so far been advanced by Coverity to the second stage of bug cleansing , dubbed " Rung 2 , " with some others expected to reach that level within the next few months .
The 11 projects now being graduated to Rung 2 include Samba ; Amanda ; Perl ; Overdose ; OpenVPN ; OpenPAM ; PHP ; Postfix ; TCL ; Overdose ; NTP ; and Python .
Other projects , however , are still either at Rung 1 in the process , or even worse , at Rung 0 , meaning that they have n't even gotten started yet on bug fixing .
Open source development is especially widespread in government , partly because of cost , but also because government agencies can be especially sensitive to avoiding vendor lock - in .
And this is n't the first time that a federal agency has gotten involved in trying to bolster software quality and security .
Over the years , a number of " hardened " Linux distribution and kernels have been created for use in government agencies and other high security environments .
One of these , seLinux , was spearheaded by the National Security Agency ( NSA ) , for example .
Now , another federal government agency -- the National Institute of Science and Technology ( NIST ) -- is reportedly working with the University of Texas , Arlington on readying a new approach to open source flaw detection , known as " combinatorial testing . "
The new approach is aimed at saving time for developers by generating tests to explore interactions among all of the various settings -- such as " on " and " off " -- of multiple variables related to software commands .
Combinatorial testing is foreseen as especially useful in improving the security and functionality of Web sites , interactive voice response ( IVR ) systems , industrial process controls , and other software applications with lots of different variables .
Researchers at NIST and the University of Texas reportedly plan to release the new testing tool early this year , after a period of beta testing .
I had assumed that by now the Rush Limbaugh story about “ phony soldiers ” would be old hat , but it really seems like the thing has legs of its own at this point .
So I suppose it ’s high time we take a look at the whole thing and marvel at what has become a two - pronged story .
Not only do we have a chronicle of just what a windbag Rush is , but how great the media is at completely missing the point .
As a note .
Yes , I ’m going to be using MediaMatters for my transcripts .
If that paints me as unfair somehow I welcome anyone to explain the problem .
Anyway , the story is old hat at this point .
Rush took a caller named Mike and started accusing those in the military who do n’t support the war and the surge of being “ phony soldiers ” .
Everyone pounced on his verbiage , and naturally I ’m going to quote the pertinent paragraph .
With one key difference : I ’m going to highlight a different part .
The phony soldiers .
If you talk to a real soldier , they are proud to serve .
They want to be over in Iraq .
They understand their sacrifice , and they ’re willing to sacrifice for their country .
Now , the media leapt on this one .
Only they gave Rush far too much credit .
They assumed he was speaking metaphorically .
They figured he was saying that the only true soldiers are ones who support the Iraq War , and that anyone else is a phony in that they may serve and wear the camo but they are n’t of the same build as the “ real ” ones who blindly support this idiocy of a war .
Naturally , Rush and his supporters immediately started to defend themselves and point out Jesse MacBeth , the guy who pretended to be a veteran who ’d seen horrors committed by the military .
While it ’s true he edited his transcript because initially he had n’t spoken of it as though he meant only out and out frauds like a guy who serves 42 days and then claims he ’s a war veteran , it ’s very likely that Rush is telling the truth , and that ’s not any better .
Keeping that in mind , we see Rush basically saying that the only way for a soldier to possibly come out in opposition of the war is if he ’s not really a soldier at all .
In Rush ’s world , the only soldiers who exist are ones who support Iraq and the surge .
It ’s quite literally impossible to find a genuine uniformed member of the military who opposes the war in Iraq because all of them want to be over there , and it ’s only the fakers who oppose it .
Brian McGough of VoteVets.org made an ad blasting Rush for his comments .
McGough got it , listen to what he said :
Rush , the shrapnel I took to my head , was real . …
My belief that we are on the wrong course in Iraq , is real .
Until you have the guts to call me a phony soldier to my face , stop telling lies about my service .
See ?
He understood .
Rush was saying the only way for a soldier for to speak out against the Iraq War is if he ’s not actually a soldier who fought in Iraq .
So McGough challenged Rush to call him a phony soldier to his face , he was n’t saying “ well Rush , if you think someone who got a purple heart is n’t a true soldier , tell me . ”
He was challenging Rush to re-assert that a man who served and willingly sacrificed for his country could n’t possibly oppose the war .
Interpreting Rush ’s comments literally and accepting his “ excuse ” is the only way his flailing in response to that ad makes any sense , when he made an even bigger ass of himself .
As she wrote :
This man will always be a hero to this country with everyone .
Whoever pumped him full of these lies about what I said and embarrassed him with this ad has betrayed him .
They ’re not hurting me , they ’re betraying this soldier .
Now , unless he actually believes what he ’s saying , in which case it ’s just so unfortunate and sad when the truth of what I said is right out there to be learned .
Now Rush ’s idiocy is coming into full light .
Once again , he is unable to comprehend the possibility that a true and honest soldier could actually be speaking out in such ferocity against both Rush himself and the Iraq War .
Now obviously he does n’t want to say that McGough is a phony soldier or a liar because that ’s obviously not the case , so he resorts to one of his and his ilk ’s favorite tactics .
Blame the liberals .
On Planet Limbaugh , there ’s no way that McGough could have served in Iraq proudly and simultaneously be so strongly opposed to the course the United States is taking in Iraq .
So the only possible explanation is that poor , naive little McGough was manipulated by the big mean liberals of MediaMatters to believe that Rush called him a phony soldier , from whence came the suicide bomber allusion .
Meanwhile the media , completely missing yet again , pounced on another section of that tirade .
They focused on that suicide bomber comment where Rush said the following :
You know , this is such a blatant use of a valiant combat veteran , lying to him about what I said , then strapping those lies to his belt , sending him out via the media in a TV ad to walk into as many people as he can walk into .
Rush and his “ dittoheads ” can spin these comments any way they ’d like , but this was absolutely , irrefutably , 100 % a statement that likened McGough to a suicide bomber .
It ’s impossible to interpret the above in any other way .
What got completely lost was what Rush meant by it .
He was n’t saying that McGough is a terrorist .
Far from it .
He was likening McGough to an easily - fooled Muslim who gets convinced by Al Qaeda to walk into a crowd of people and blow himself up .
He was saying that McGough is too much of a buffoon to understand when he ’s being exploited for the evil purposes of an anti-American group , that he ’s a naive victim who ’s damaging himself by repeating the lies the left told him .
But instead of that , all the media ’s doing is repeating the “ phony soldier ” and “ suicide bomber ” comments while completely missing what he really meant .
Now , all Rush needed to do to fix the situation was say something like the following :
So by now you ’ve seen the VoteVets ad with Iraq War veteran Brian McGough .
I ’d like to issue an apology to McGough and clarify my comments .
I was n’t calling him a phony soldiers , I made the mistake of saying that people who serve support the war and that it ’s only the liars and fakers who pretend to be soldiers that are speaking out against it .
I disagree with McGough on this position but I would never claim he ’s not a real soldier .
He and those like him are not who I was referring to .
He did n’t .
Reason being that the possibility was n’t on his radar .
When presented with an actual Iraq veteran who took shrapnel to the damn head and was publicly opposing the war , the only explanation is that he was being manipulated by the left .
In Rush ’s mind , there are two kinds of soldiers : those who support the war and those who are too stupid to know that the left is lying to them .
A day later , Rush attempted a mea culpa of sorts , going after the media for a while and then saying McGough is a hero whether or not he supports the war ( in direct contradiction to his prior claim that he could only oppose it if he is n’t aware of the “ truth ” Rush is saying ) , but the fact remains that he did equate him to a suicide bomber and did say that only phony soldiers oppose the war .
To sum up .
Rush did n’t claim that soldiers who oppose the war are phony soldiers .
He said that only phony soldiers oppose the war and that all the real ones support it , that there simply are n’t any soldiers who oppose the war .
Then when confronted with one who did , his only rationale was that he had been fed lies and unleashed the way terrorists manipulate easily - misled people on suicide bombing missions .
And now he ’s covering his ass .
Of course , the media missed all of that .
Instead , they decided to focus on the sound bytes over the substance .
Shame , that .
New Hampshire Election Fraud : Hillary LOST the paper ballot count but WON the optical scan ballot count .
Obama WON the paper ballot count but LOST the optical scan ballot count .
I knew there was something a bit fishy about Hillary winning New Hampshire .
First of all , today , all the polls indicated a double - digit lead for Obama .
Obama internal polls had him winning by 14 points .
Hillary 's camp had him winning by 11 points .
Even the Hillary camp conceded virtual defeat early on .
Even Hillary believed she had lost before the polls closed .
I can't recall a primary where a candidate had a double - digit lead the day of the election , but finished several points behind .
Even the exit polling showed no sign of a Hillary win .
The exit polls showed about even .
Exit polls have a history of accurate projections .
Despite this , Hillary maintained about a three point difference the entire evening .
AP called it for Hillary with only 61 % reporting .
CNN still refused to call if for Hillary , as they explained and demonstrated on an electronic map how several key precincts had not come in yet .
But that did n't stop NBC calling it for Hillary .
With 94 % reporting , those key precincts STILL showed zero per cent reporting .
NONE of the TV pundits could explain the differences .
Here 's one pundit 's excuse : " Maybe it has to do with the voting curtain in New Hampshire ( private voting ) whereas Iowa was public voting . "
Today , pundits are still scratching their heads trying to figure out how all the polls were wrong , the Clinton camp projections were wrong ; the Obama camp projections were wrong - it just does n't add up to anything other than election fraud .
A room at a brothel in a file photo .
A Polish man got the shock of his life when he visited a brothel and spotted his wife among the establishment 's employees .

WARSAW ( Reuters ) - A Polish man got the shock of his life when he visited a brothel and spotted his wife among the establishment ’s employees .
Polish tabloid Super Express said the woman had been making some extra money on the side while telling her husband she worked at a store in a nearby town .
“ I was dumfounded .
I thought I was dreaming , ” the husband told the newspaper Wednesday .
The couple , married for 14 years , are now divorcing , the newspaper reported .
Waitress tells campaign reporters : ‘ You people are really nuts ’
It ’s hard to say for sure when the “ silly season ” started in the media ’s coverage of the presidential campaign .
If there was a “ serious season , ” it was exceedingly short .
I ’m afraid I missed it .
But yesterday was unusually inane .
A waitress at an Iowa diner noted that Hillary Clinton and her campaign aides had recently stopped by , but did n’t leave a tip .
NPR picked up on the “ story , ” the New York Times called it a “ potentially embarrassing mini- scandal , ” and Drudge blared it above the fold .
Soon after , NBC News and ABC News were trumpeting the story .
Clinton did n’t leave a tip ?
Does she hate working people ?
Is she out of touch ?
What does this say about her economic plan ?
What do her rivals think about this ?
Why wo n’t Barack Obama attack her over the issue ?
Is it too soon to put a poll in the field gauging the public ’s reaction ?
All of this breathless fascination was for naught .
It turned out Clinton ’s campaign did leave a tip with the manager for the entire serving staff .
Clinton ’s individual waitress did n’t know that , so there was a simple misunderstanding .
Reporters ended up contacting the waitress , Anita Esterday , at her home in Iowa yesterday .
Ms. Esterday said she did not understand what all the commotion was about .
“ You people are really nuts , ” she told a reporter during a phone interview .
“ There ’s kids dying in the war , the price of oil right now — there ’s better things in this world to be thinking about than who served Hillary Clinton at Maid - Rite and who got a tip and who did n’t get a tip . ”
Thank you , Anita Esterday .
“ You people are really nuts ” may actually be the most helpful and poignant media criticism I ’ve seen this year .
It has the added benefit of being true .
It ’s also a reminder of just what it takes to get some political reporters excited .
Last week , Rudy Giuliani unveiled a campaign ad in Iowa with an obvious , demonstrable lie .
Many of us begged reporters to take it seriously , and give it the full - court press .
Some columnists noted the problem , but most outlets followed the AP ’s lead : “ No one argues that Rudy Giuliani was diagnosed with prostate cancer , underwent treatment and survived .
Yet there is a dispute about the statistics he quotes about his chances of survival . ”
A “ dispute , ” as if there was some question about whether Giuliani had intentionally lied to voters in an ad .
Was there a media freak - out ?
Not even a little .
A leading candidate deceiving the public about cancer just is n’t sexy enough .
And what is ?
In recent months , the most prominent media frenzies have dealt with John Edwards ’ hair , Hillary Clinton ’s laugh , Rudy Giuliani ’s cell phone , and now Clinton ’s approach to gratuities .
“ You people are really nuts ” sums the situation up nicely , does n’t it ?
This giant green Christmas tree was recently sighted at the base of an office building in Tokyo , Japan .
But unlike its Rockefeller Center counterpart , this one can entirely vanish with the flip of a switch .
The bright green laser tree was on display from December 18 to 22 between the towers of the Yurakucho Marion building in the Tokyo ’s fashionable Ginza district .
I still think nothing ’s quite as good as Madrid ’s Pac - Man Christmas tree , but this one is still cooler than your average evergreen .
An amputee with a phantom limb , fancy that .
Lewis ’s aside that Tree of Smoke “ does n’t feel like a Denis Johnson novel ” lends weight to the assumption that a writer cannot become famous by writing like this , at least not yet .
But with no way to prove insincerity on the reviewers ’ part , I have to pretend to believe that they really do consider Tree of Smoke to be “ something like a masterpiece ” ( Lewis ) and “ bound to become one of the classic works of literature ” ( Kakutani ) about the Vietnam War .
( The novel , a New York Times best seller , has been nominated for a National Book Award . )
Underlying the hype is the silly notion that if a work introduces plenty of characters and traipses after them for enough years and pages , it is ipso facto ambitious .
The true mark of an ambitious work is its style and depth .
We would recognize Anna Karenina as such a novel even if only its first few pages had survived , because they depict characters with extraordinarily rich and complex inner lives .
In contrast , Tree of Smoke starts off with one Seaman Bill Houston shooting a tiny monkey he sees in the jungle .
( The symbolism of this happening hours after JFK ’s assassination is crude in more ways than one . )
The animal , evidently a gun buff , spreads its arms “ enthusiastically ” before dropping to the ground , where its mood changes .
“ With fascination , then with revulsion , [ Bill ] realized that the monkey was crying . ”
Such a realization would take far too short a time for anyone to become fascinated , let alone for fascination to yield to revulsion — and why revulsion anyway ?
Later , Bill meets up with his younger brother James , a soldier .
For some reason , Bill does not know James ’s age , and appears surprised to learn that he is not yet 18 .
James “ done lied ” to the recruiter .
The level of their conversation can be imagined .
We are then introduced to another central character , Skip , with the news that
having been raised in the American heartland he was dedicated to steering clear of personal controversy , to ignoring scowls , honoring evasiveness , fending off voices raised in other rooms .
Ignoring scowls is no way to steer clear of controversy , but never mind that .
The derivation of a man ’s personality from his place of origin is the stuff of second - rate thrillers .
After two months in the Philippines , Skip
liked the people , he hated the climate .
It was the start of his fifth year serving the United States as a member of its Central Intelligence Agency .
He considered both the Agency and his country to be glorious .
Anyone expecting a psychological novel from characters so lacking in complexity deserves to be disappointed .
There is no point in dwelling on the story line , because even some of the book ’s admirers have conceded its sluggishness and overlength — albeit with some humbug about how flaws make a good novel more likable , perfection being such a turnoff , etc .
As for the action , it never feels authentic .
Soldiers do not laugh in unison or call out frantically for M&Ms during a sudden and intense firefight , nor would a soldier crawling through bush find the attendant lacerations “ exhilarating . ”
Not once does the reader feel fear or tension .
Whether it ’s because of the compulsive references to the Kennedys or the constant emphasis on the soldier as rock - and - roll hipster , one thinks only of the silver - screen ’ Nam and of Life , not life , feeble substitutes for the riches to be had from Michael Herr ’s Dispatches and Tim O’Brien ’s The Things They Carried .
Now that he has his moment in the political spotlight , former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee does not want his days at the pulpit to be scrutinized .
As Huckabee has surged to the front of the Republican pack in Iowa , his religious views have drawn media and voter attention .
After all , Huckabee , a former Baptist pastor , has been campaigning as a “ Christian leader . ”
But he has vacillated on how far to interject faith into politics .
At an early debate , he indicated he does not believe in evolution , but at a more recent debate , when he was asked by Wolf Blitzer if the creation of the Earth occurred six thousand years ago and only took six days , as stated in the Old Testament , Huckabee said , “ I do n’t know .
I was n’t there . ”
During a question - and - answer session with students at fundamentalist Liberty University last month , he asserted that his rise in the polls has an explanation that is “ beyond human ” and is due to the power of his supporters ’ prayers .
Afterward , he backtracked slightly , adding , “ I ’m saying that when people pray , things happen … .
I ’m not saying that God wants me to be elected . ”
( At a victory rally held after Huckabee won a 1993 special election for lieutenant governor , Huckabee told his supporters that he had only won because God had intervened , according to the Texarkana Gazette . )
With Huckabee walking this fine line , his campaign has declined to make available sermons that Huckabee delivered during his preaching days .
Before beginning his political career , Huckabee was a Southern Baptist minister for 12 years in his home state of Arkansas .
He assumed the pastorate at Immanuel Baptist Church in the town of Pine Bluff in 1980 , at the age of 25 .
Six years later , he moved to Beech Street First Baptist Church in Texarkana .
In both locations , Huckabee ’s energy , ambition , and skills as a communicator energized his congregation .
Under his leadership , each church grew .
When asked for copies of the sermons Huckabee delivered at Immanuel Church , an employee there claimed none could be found .
A Beech Street Church pastor ’s assistant maintained that much of the archival material from Huckabee ’s tenure as pastor had been destroyed during a remodeling .
The rest , she said , was not available to the press .
When Mother Jones contacted the Huckabee campaign and asked if it would help make his previous sermons available , the campaign replied in a one - sentence email that it had received multiple requests for such material and was “ not able to accommodate ” them .
Only a small sampling of Huckabee ’s early speeches are publicly available .
While the pastor at Beech Street , Huckabee became president of the Arkansas Baptist State Convention .
( At 34 , he was the youngest person to ever preside over the 490,000 - person group . )
He held the office from 1989 to 1991 .
Several of his sermonlike speeches were featured in the convention ’s publications .
In a 1990 speech to his fellow state Baptists , Huckabee urged the audience to hold to what he called “ The 10 Commendations , ” including “ Thou shalt love like a family ” and “ Thou shalt be found faithful . ”
Huckabee also said , “ It does n’t embarrass me one bit to let you know that I believe Adam and Eve were real people . ”
This remark was a bolder endorsement of biblical creationism than any comment Huckabee has been willing to make while campaigning for president this year .
During a CNN / YouTube debate , the Republican field was asked by a man holding a Bible , “ Do you believe every word of this book ? ”
Huckabee said that portions of the Bible should “ obviously ” be seen as “ allegorical . ”
He again stated that he could not know the exact meaning of parts of the Bible , saying , “ There are parts of it I do n’t fully comprehend and understand , because the Bible is a revelation of an infinite god , and no finite person is ever going to fully understand it . ”
His earlier comment about Adam and Eve suggests he takes at least Genesis literally .
Huckabee certainly has reason to be concerned about an examination of his earlier remarks and sermons .
Comments he made 15 years ago about AIDS and homosexuality recently became a campaign issue .
During a failed run for the U.S. Senate in 1992 , Huckabee noted in response to a questionnaire , “ Homosexuality is an aberrant , unnatural , and sinful lifestyle , and we now know it can pose a dangerous public health risk . ”
He suggested that the federal government commit no additional federal funding to finding a cure for AIDS , then considered by many to be a gay disease .
In the same reply , Huckabee displayed callousness toward AIDS victims and an ignorance about the ways in which AIDS could be transmitted .
“ If the federal government is truly serious about doing something with the AIDS virus , we need to take steps that would isolate the carriers of this plague , ” he wrote .
“ It is the first time in the history of civilization in which the carriers of a genuine plague have not been isolated from the general population , and in which this deadly disease for which there is no cure is being treated as a civil rights issue instead of the true health crisis it represents . ”
Instead of additional federal funding , said Huckabee , “ An alternative would be to request that multimillionaire celebrities , such as Elizabeth Taylor [ , ]
Madonna and others who are pushing for more AIDS funding be encouraged to give out of their own personal treasuries increased amounts for AIDS research . ”
Seeking to explain these comments recently , Huckabee made it clear that he still sees homosexuality as sinful , but that he has softened his position on AIDS research .
“ If I were making those same comments today , I might make them a little differently , ” he said .
Huckabee has indeed mixed religion with policy previously .
In 1997 , when he was governor , he answered a question about capital punishment during a call - in show :
Interestingly enough , if there was ever an occasion for someone to have argued against the death penalty , I think Jesus could have done so on the cross and said , “ This is an unjust punishment and I deserve clemency . ”
Huckabee ’s argument : since Jesus did n’t say that , according to the New Testament , capital punishment is fine .
Also that year , Huckabee refused to sign legislation to assist storm victims because the measure referred to tornadoes and floods as “ acts of God . ”
Putting his name on such legislation , Huckabee explained , “ would be violating my own conscience ” due to the bill equating “ a destructive and deadly force ” as “ an act of God . ”
In all the sermons Huckabee delivered before jumping into politics , he no doubt revealed beliefs and ideas that would be of interest to voters today .
But his campaign , looking to attract evangelical Christian voters without alienating others , is not interested in seeing that material become part of the current political discourse .
Huckabee the candidate is shunning Huckabee the pastor .
This is the first instalment of David Spiegelhalter 's regular column called Understanding uncertainty .
League tables are controversial and for good reason .
Few things are simple enough to be measured by a single outcome like , for example , the number of exam passes or successful heart operations .
But even if we do accept a single yardstick , we have n't yet reckoned with chance , which by itself can produce apparent patterns to delight any tabloid editor .
Take the National Lottery as an example .
As we 'll see in a moment , a league table based on the whole history of the lottery appears to show that some numbers are preferentially drawn .
Other numbers do n't come up for ages .
Clear evidence for cheating , or even the hand of god ?
Not necessarily ; in fact the league table , taken at face - value , is completely spurious .
What is at work here is simply chance .
Let 's have a look at the details .
Lucky numbers and unfortunate gaps
The UK National Lottery began on the 19th of November 1994 and there had been 1240 draws up to the 20th of October 2007 .
Six balls are randomly drawn from a set of forty - nine numbered balls .
If you correctly predict the six numbers , you get a share of the jackpot .
The figure below shows how often each of the 49 numbers came up in the first 1240 draws .
We can take another angle on this by looking at the gap between each time a number comes up .
The animation below keeps track of each time a specific number is not drawn .
The animation starts from the beginning of 2000 .
If you look carefully from the start of 2000 , you 'll see that the longest gap observed is 72 , for number 17 , which appeared in draw 435 on the 23rd of February 2000 , but did not appear again until draw 508 on the 4th of November 2000 .
A back - of - the - envelope calculation shows that such a long gap is rare indeed .
The chance of a particular number occurring in a single draw is 6/49 , which means that the probability of a number not being picked is 1-6/49=43/49 .
The chance of this happening 72 times in a row is thus ( 43/49 ) 72 , which is roughly 0.000082 , or 1 in 12,500 !
What our league tables have shown us so far — a lucky number 38 and a gap of improbable size — does n't seem to sit well with the assumption that the lottery is truly random .
This is the sticky point at which you might be tempted to suspect the lottery of being rigged , or evoke cosmic interference .
But with a little mathematical stamina it 's possible to find out whether this is still within the realms of pure chance .
So take a deep breath and sharpen your pencil .
The distribution of the number of appearances of each number
First you need to define a theoretical probability distribution based on the assumption that the lottery is random .
Let stand for the number of balls chosen at each draw and for the number of balls in the bag , so in our case and .
If the numbers are chosen at random , then for each the chance of being drawn is , so here .
The chance of a number not being chosen at a particular draw is .
To work out the probability that in draws a particular number is drawn exactly times , you have to consider three factors .
The first is that the number was picked times .
The chance of this is .
The second is that it was not picked times .
The chance of this is .
So is the chance of a particular sequence of picks and non-picks being observed .
The third thing to notice is that overall there are
different sequences ofpicks and non - picks ( here ) .
Each of these contributes an amount ofto the overall chance .
Therefore , the chance that indraws our number is drawn exactlytimes is : This is awith parametersand .
The distribution has meanand variance .
We 're interested in large values ofhere and it turns out that for these values the binomial distribution can be approximated by awith matching mean and variance .
Below we see the final observed distribution with an approximate theoretical distribution superimposed .
The fit looks good , suggesting that there is no real preference for particular numbers .
The lucky number 38 is no evidence of bias .
The observed and the theoretical distribution .
The distribution of gaps between a number 's appearances
You can work out the theoretical distribution of gaps between numbers in a similar way .
Consider a particular number .
Label a draw a success if number is drawn and a failure otherwise .
As before , the chance of a success is .
Let stand for the number of failures before the first success , in other words the gap before is drawn again .
The chance of taking on any particular value is the same as the chance of observing a series of failures followed by a single success , so that
The observed and the theoretical distribution of gaps .
The maximum gap in the whole lottery history
This is the geometric distribution .
Its mean is , so the mean gap length is around 7 .
( Note that this distribution is sometimes defined as the time until the first success , which here corresponds to Y=X+1 . )
The histogram below shows the distribution of all the gaps , with the theoretical geometric distribution superimposed .
The gaps are divided into those below and above 40 , so that the large gaps are clearly displayed : the theoretical distribution seems to fit the observed distribution well , although there are inevitably some jagged bits in the tail .
But what about that maximum gap of 72 , which we worked out to be extremely unlikely ?
It turns out that we asked slightly the wrong question , namely : " The number 17 has just been drawn , what is the chance that it will not be drawn within the next 72 draws ? "
In reality , though , we are looking at the results of 1240 draws , rather than just 72 , and we are not interested specifically in the number 17 .
What we should have asked is : " After 1240 draws , what is the chance that any of the gaps between two draws of the same number is greater than 72 ? " .
To work this out , we first need to know how many gaps there are in total .
There have been 1240 draws , each featuring 6 numbers , so altogether 1240 × 6 = 7440 numbers have been drawn .
Each time a number appears , there is a corresponding gap since it last appeared ( this includes the initial gap until each number is drawn for the first time ) .
Our question now becomes : " What is the chance that the longest of these 7440 gaps is at least 72 ? " .
We can estimate this chance using our distribution :
The last part of the equation holds because the probability that all gaps are less than 72 is approximately the product of 7440 identical probabilities that a single gap is less than 72 .
( The result is only approximate because there is some slight dependence between the gaps due to there always being 6 numbers in each draw - we shall check how good this approximation is later ) .
Now
This result suggests that a maximum gap of length 72 is not in the least surprising .
In fact , there nearly is a fifty - fifty chance of a gap of at least that length occurring in 1240 lottery draws .
To check the accuracy of this result we can simulate " fictional " lottery histories on a computer , by picking 6 different numbers at random from 1 to 49 , and then repeating this process 1240 times .
The software we use contains random number generators that should ensure that each number really does have an equal chance of being chosen .
We simulated 1000 full lottery histories and found the longest gap in each history which had the distribution shown below : 470 ( 47 % ) out of 1000 were 72 or more , which is similar to our approximate theoretical probability of 0.46 .
Good !
Testing for bias in the lottery
The good fit between the theoretical and observed distributions suggests that what we 've observed in the 1240 draws is in keeping with the assumption that the lottery is random .
Yet , the distributions do differ .
How large can we allow this difference to become before we start to worry ?
In other words , how confident can we be of our conclusion that the lottery is random ?
Probability theory has an answer to this question too .
In fact , there are many test statistics designed to identify different ways in which the lottery draws may not be entirely random .
Let 's consider one of the simplest .
The binomial distribution above says that after draws we expect any particular number to have occurred times .
In the UK lottery this corresponds to , approximately .
So , for example , after 1240 draws we would expect each number to have been chosen around times .
Now add up the total number of times each number has occurred after draws and label these totals , , etc , up to .
For each number the expression is a measure of the discrepancy between what 's observed and what 's expected .
If we add the for the 49 values of , we get an overall measure of discrepancy - it's called the chi-squared statistic and usually denoted by .
To match our set - up we need to multiply this standard chi-squared statistic by the small amount .
This is because , as already mentioned above , the totals are not quite independent .
It 's rather a tricky bit of statistical theory and we wo n't go into it here .
Just as it was possible to work out a theoretical distribution of the occurrences of each number based on the assumption that the lottery is random , it is possible to work out a theoretical distribution of .
It is called a chi-squared distribution with , in this case , degrees of freedom .
It tells us the chance of observing our particular value for assuming that the lottery is indeed random ( and assuming that all the balls being drawn are statistically independent ) .
If this chance is low , say less than 0.05 , or 5 % , then there 's reason to worry .
We wo n't say much about the chi-squared distribution itself here .
All we 'll say is that in our particular case it tells us that our observed value of should be somewhere in the region of 48 .
It also tells us that the chance of our observed value being greater than 69 or less than 38.9 is only 0.05 , or 5 % , so we should watch out for observed values in those regions .
The histogram below shows the observed values of the statistic where the draws have been combined in groups of fifty , so in each case .
As it turns out , all observed values lie between the dotted lines at 60 and 38.9 — we can be reasonably confident that the lottery is indeed random .
Thus , the patterns we spotted in the lottery league table were red herrings .
But what about those league tables that do not arise from pure chance ?
Can we separate chance from meaningful information in these cases ?
This is what we 'll explore in the next issue of Plus .
Our example will be the Premier League !

' Holy cow , ' exclaims MSNBC host , Rove thinks Bush could sink GOP Mike Aivaz and Jason Rhyne
Published : Tuesday November 20 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Former chief Bush political strategist Karl Rove is telling GOP Oval Office seekers in 2008 to keep a safe distance from the man he helped to twice elect , according to MSNBC host Dan Abrams ' interpretation of a recent opinion column penned by Rove .
" It sounds to me like Karl Rove is giving the Republican candidates advice that says ' get away from my guy , ' " Abrams said of Rove 's Saturday column in Newsweek , in which the the former adviser warned that President Bush 's lagging poll numbers would do no favors for GOP presidential hopefuls in 2008 .
" Am I the only one who 's reading Karl Rove and saying ' holy cow ? ' " the host asked later .
In the column , entitled " How to Beat Hillary ( Next ) November , " Rove laid out a loose general election strategy to combat frontrunning Democratic presidential contender Sen. Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) .
" So show them who you are in a way that gives the American people hope , optimism and insight , " he wrote to would - be Republican nominees .
" That 's the best antidote to the low approval rates of the Republican president
Those numbers will not help the GOP candidate , just as the even lower approval ratings of the Congress will not help the Democratic standard - bearer . "
Abrams said that the advice was a telling indicator about the state of the Republican Party .
" When you 've got Karl Rove advising ... the Republican candidates to effectively distance themselves from President Bush , " remarked the host , " I think that tells you how much trouble President Bush , and possibly the Republicans , are in . "
Guest pundit Pat Buchanan , himself a former adviser to President Richard Nixon , agreed with Abrams ' assessment .
" [ Bush ] is a liability to the Republican candidate next year , " said Buchanan .
" I mean , Karl Rove is acting as a strategist here and he 's saying exactly what I would say , which is once that convention gets going ... move away from the president and the administration .
Put distance between them and make Hillary Rodham Clinton the issue and do n't let them make Bush the issue . "
Buchanan added , however , that Bush would likely be glad to accept criticism from others in his party if it would aid the prospects of 2008 Republican candidates .
" Thats what guys say in the real business , I 'll come in and criticize you if it 'll help you out , " added Buchanan .
" If you want to help the party , I think Bush would say himself , ' move away from me . ' "
Air America radio host Rachel Maddow , also a guest during the segment , said that what struck her most about the Newsweek piece was what she perceived as a lack of substance in the political advice offered .
" The most important thing about this article I think is not so much that Rove is telling the candidates to run away from Bush -- although that is funny , " she said , adding later in the program that " Rove has no substantive advice to give to candidates other than to ' smile and pretend Bush does n't exist . ' "
The column also included Rove 's urgings for the eventual Republican nominee to be " strong on Iraq , " to talk about issues like " health care , the cost of college and social mobility , " and to go after minority voters " who are n't traditional Republicans . "

From the romantic image of the astronomer gazing at the heavens to the spectacular snapshots captured by the intricately crafted lenses of the Galileo and Hubble telescopes , telescopic technologies have garnered the most notice among the public as the way to study the universe .
But these methods - called direct observation - are limited because Earth - bound star gazers see events often billions of years after they have occurred , due to the incredible distances separating Earth 's galaxy , the Milky Way , from others .
The coming weeks will bring a new development in the field of theoretical astronomy , as a team of researchers at the Cornell Theory Center debuts a new algorithm that will allow them to simulate how the universe formed after the Big Bang .
" After the Big Bang , we have to ask what the universe is made of .
Most of it is seen as exotic particles , or baryons , but different models show different rates at which the universe is expanding , " said Dr. Renyue Cen , a Princeton University researcher working on the project .
" We 're trying to find the correct model of the universe .
But the only way to test it is by putting them into the computer and evolve it , given the physical laws they must follow . "
Theoretical astronomy helps fill in the billion - year holes left by direct observation by using supercomputers to model different researchers ' theories .
" Since we can't do actual experiments on stars , planets , galaxies , or even the whole universe , we must do the experiments numerically , " said Terry Oswalt , a professor of physics and space sciences at the Florida Institute of Technology .
Scientists working on the Cornell project are busily examining galaxy clusters and simulating their evolution on an IBM RS / 6000 Scaleable POWERparallel system .
The new algorithm will enable them to more accurately simulate the " particles of matter " that are between the clusters of galaxies , and can provide crucial data from about 51 million years after the Big Bang up to today - a period of time spanning 13 billion years - says Cen .
The previous simulation used by the team followed only dark matter and interacted only with gravity .
It supplemented the simulation with the Particle Mesh method , which enabled it to more closely measure gas pressure in the space between the galaxies .
Cen said the new algorithm is an Adaptive Mesh model , which enables researchers to compact their model of the universe patterned along a uniform grid in the simulation .
By compacting the grid the way a recycler would crush an aluminum can , the researchers bring the simulation of the widespread galaxy clusters closer together .
This gives astrophysicists a better chance of determining what happened , because they can look at a larger number of galaxy clusters together .
" The primary difficulty is that you need to have a big volume of galaxy clusters to have a fair sample .
The typical separation is about 50 megaparsecs , or 150 million light years , " Cen said .
" Right now , we can only have one cluster in a simulation box .
It is not representative of the whole universe .
With the new algorithm , we will be able to increase the volume to 10 galaxy clusters or more in one field of view . "
It will bring the matter between the galaxies nearer as well .
The new algorithm will allow the " big step forward by deforming the grid , " said Cen .
" The trick is to move the mesh , the grid points , to where the clusters are .
The algorithm tells the program how and when to deform the grid .
It is a dynamic process .
The grid of the universe is normally quite uniform .
At the end of the simulation , though , it will be quite irregular . "
The project , which has received funding from the Advanced Research Projects Administration , the National Science Foundation , and IBM , is just about to begin .
Cen says simulations could last as long as six days or even longer .
But that time span is nothing compared to the eons that are being compacted in the simulation .
Oswalt , who is not involved in this particular project , said the time scales involved in the study of galaxy clusters is so long - millions of years and more - that their " motions can only be simulated numerically .
These simulations can predict what the positions and velocities and masses of cluster members should look like now , and such comparisons with the Hubble and ground - based data are used to decide among the competing computed models which is most likely correct . "

The Fertile Crescent of the Middle East has long been identified as a “ cradle of civilization ” for humans .
In a new genetic study , researchers at the University of California , Davis , have concluded that all ancestral roads for the modern day domestic cat also lead back to the same locale .
Findings of the study , involving more than 11,000 cats , are reported in the cover article of the January issue of the journal Genomics .
“ This study confirms earlier research suggesting that the domestication of the cat started in the Fertile Crescent region , ” said Monika Lipinski , lead researcher on the study and a doctoral candidate in the School of Veterinary Medicine .
“ It also provides a warning for modern cat fanciers to make sure they maintain a broad genetic base as they further develop their breeds . ”
Leslie Lyons , an authority on cat genetics and principal investigator on this study , said : “ More than 200 genetic disorders have been identified in modern cats , and many are found in pure breeds .
We hope that cat breeders will use the genetic information uncovered by this study to develop efficient breed - management plans and avoid introducing genetically linked health problems into their breeds . ”
HISTORY OF THE MODERN CAT
Earlier archaeological evidence and research on the evolutionary history of cats has suggested that domestication of the cat originated about 5,000 to 8,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent , a region located today in the Middle East .
This is the area around the eastern end of the Mediterranean , stretching from Turkey to northern Africa and eastward to modern day Iraq and Iran .
This domestication of the cat occurred as humans transitioned from nomadic herding to raising crops and livestock .
Cats , with their penchant for hunting mice , rats and other rodents , became useful companions as people domesticated , grew and stored wild grains and grasses .
Eventually , cats also became pets but were never fully domesticated .
Even today , most domestic cats remain self - sufficient , if necessary , and continue to be efficient hunters , even when provided with food .
Cats and their gene pools spread rapidly around the world as ancient civilizations developed trade routes .
Unlike other domesticated species , there has been little effort to improve on the cat for functional purposes .
Instead , development of cat breeds has been driven more by preferences for certain aesthetic qualities like coat color and color patterns .
Today , there are 50 recognized cat breeds .
Of that total , 16 breeds are thought to be “ natural breeds ” that occurred in specific regions , while the remaining breeds were developed during the past 50 years .
THE UC DAVIS STUDY
In this study , the UC Davis research team focused on :
tracing the movement of the modern cat through the ancient world and to the Americas ,
measuring changes in genetic diversity as cats dispersed throughout the world , and
measuring any loss of genetic diversity that might have occurred in the development of the older or more contemporary breeds .
The researchers collected samples of cheek cells from more than 11,000 cats .
These cats represented 17 populations of randomly bred cats from Europe , the Mediterranean , Asia , Africa and the Americas , as well as 22 recognized breeds .
DNA samples of most breeds were obtained at cat shows or were sent in upon the lab ’s request by cat owners in the United States .
The study was assisted by a host of collaborators from throughout the world .
DNA , or deoxyribonucleic acid , is the hereditary material in humans , other animals and plants .
It carries the instructions or blueprint for making all the structures and materials that the organism needs to function .
Genetic markers called “ microsatellite markers , ” commonly used for DNA profiling , were used to determine the genetic relationships of cat breeds , their geographic origins and the levels of genetic loss that have resulted from inbreeding .
NEW FINDINGS
From the DNA analysis , the researchers found that the cats were genetically clustered in four groups that corresponded with the regions of Europe , the Mediterranean basin , east Africa and Asia .
They discovered that randomly bred cats in the Americas were genetically similar to randomly bred cats from Western Europe .
They also found that the Maine coone and American shorthair — two breeds that originated in the United States — were genetically similar to the seven Western European breeds .
This suggests that cats brought to the New World by European settlers have not had sufficient time to develop significant genetic differentiation from their Western European ancestors .
The study yielded many interesting breed - specific findings .
For example , the researchers found that the Persian breed , perhaps the oldest recognized pure breed , was not genetically associated with randomly bred cat populations from the Near East , but rather was more closely associated with randomly bred cats of Western Europe .
In addition , the researchers found that , of the Asian cat breeds , only the Japanese bobtail was genetically clustered with Western cats , although it did retain some Asian influence .
Cats from the Mediterranean region were found to be genetically uniform , perhaps a result of the constant movement of ships and caravans during the early era of the cat ’s domestication , the researchers suggested .
LESSON FOR CAT BREEDERS
The study found that genetic diversity remained surprisingly broad among cats from various parts of the world .
However the data indicated that there was some loss of diversity associated even with the long - term development of foundation cat breeds – those breeds that provided the genetic basis from which modern pure breeds were developed .
The researchers note that , given the relatively short time span during which modern breeds are emerging , cat breeders should proceed cautiously as they develop their breeds , making sure to maintain a broad genetic base that will minimize introduction of genetically based health problems .

Let ’s say you want to add a chart to a blog post .
How do you generate the chart ?
I ’d guess that the majority of bloggers would use some client software like Excel that can create charts to enter the data , save the chart as an image , and upload it .
But what if you want the chart to represent volatile data , like the results of an ongoing survey that are stored in a database ?
Well , the good folks at Google have released the Google Chart API .
It ’s a really simple API for generating various kinds of chart images from data and options provided in a URL .
A single HTTP GET request with parameters is all you need .
You can even use the URL as the src attribute on an img tag , as shown below :
The URL for this image is http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=p3&chs=300×250&chd=s:Google, where “ p3 ” is the type of chart ( 3 - D Pie ) , “ 300 ×250 ” is the chart size , and “ s : Google ” is the data .
The data , you say ?
And that ’s where “ simple ” starts to break down .
Each letter in the word “ Google ” in this example stands for a data point with a value between 0 and 61 , where “ A ” thru “ Z ” represent 0 - 25 , “ a ” thru “ z ” map to 26 - 51 , “ 0 ” thru “ 9 ” cover 52 - 61 , and missing values are represented by an underscore .
Commas are used to separate series .
The leading “ s : ” says that the encoding is “ simple ” .
So that means you have to scale your data to the range 0 - 61 , and then encode it using those rules .
It ’s so simple that Google provides an example Javascript routine to convert an array of values to the required string , based on a maximum .
That ’s not the only method for encoding data that Google provides , but the two other methods also require that you scale your data to a fixed range of values , so you might as well use the “ simple ” one .
Other than that minor headache , though , the API is pretty neat .
You can control colors and transparency , titles , legends , axis labels , line styles , and more .
For chart types , you can choose between Line , Bar , Pie , Venn , and Scatter diagrams — with specific options for each .
Check out the API documentation and go nuts !
Oh , sorry , their usage policy limits you to 50,000 queries per user per day — so try to keep it under control , folks .
UPDATE : I created a little tool in PHP for prototyping these charts .
You can use it here , or download the sources .
We ’ve got a lot of big news today at NewsGator .
First , we ’ve got new releases of our most popular applications : FeedDemon 2.6 , NetNewsWire 3.1 , Inbox 3.0 ( beta ) , and NewsGator Go! for Windows Mobile 2.0 .
Each of these is a pretty major release on its own – tons of new features in all of them .
But second , every one of those applications is now free !
Free as in beer , that is .
And add to the free list NewsGator Go! for BlackBerry as well .
And not only are they free , but our online services ( including synchronization ) are now free as well !
Not to mention our iPhone reader , HTML mobile reader , and all of the other applications that are part of our online platform .
I have n’t been this excited about our consumer products and strategy since we bought FeedDemon and NetNewsWire a couple of years ago .
But I can hear you asking already … ” why , Greg , why would you do such a thing ? ”
What we ’re working to do is to saturate the market with our clients .
Anyone who wants a rich experience for consuming content , or anyone who uses multiple computers or devices and wants a best - of - breed experience on each can now use our clients .
Using a Mac at home , along with an iPhone ?
NetNewsWire and our iPhone reader will sync up .
Have a PC at the office ?
FeedDemon will sync with your other two applications .
And they ’ll all sync with NewsGator Online .
It all just works .
There are two reasons we want our clients to become ubiquitous .
Well , three if you count “ we want to be nice . ”
But two other reasons . :-)
First , we ’ve found that when we go into an enterprise to sell NewsGator Enterprise Server ( NGES ) and Social Sites , there are already a ton of people using one of our desktop apps already .
The more folks are already using them , the easier it is to sell our server products – especially since these client apps can sync with NGES directly .
So , the more the merrier – we ’re going to make sure that everyone who wants to use our apps can do so , without having to climb over the hump of having to dig out their credit card .
And second , we want to collect “ attention ” data ( actually I like to call this activity data , but everyone else in the world calls it attention ) and use it to make everyone ’s experience better .
If there is a specific feed you love , and you ’re constantly emailing its articles to friends or saving articles in your clippings , that ’s interesting … and if there are a lot of people doing this , it ’s probably a good indicator about the “ relevancy ” of that content for other users .
Similar with individual articles that are getting a lot of attention from users .
Basically , by using your data , in combination with aggregate data from other users , we can deliver a better experience for everyone .
And that ’s a good thing – both for us and for you .
We ’ve taken some small steps along these lines so far in the client applications – watch over the next few months as these capabilities really start to come into their own , and roll out both in the online reader and continue to evolve in the clients .
We ’ve talked about APML in the past , and said we ’d implement APML export in the clients .
We ’re going to take that a step further – and implement an endpoint in our online platform where you ( and only you ! ) can always access your personal APML data .
That data will be a rollup of all of your activity across all of our clients that you use .
We ’re also going to make aggregate data available via API .
You should start to see all of this start rolling out within the next couple of months .
So anyway – this is great news !
I ’m personally really excited about this , and I ’m looking forward to hearing from you .
There are a lot of details I did n’t cover here … so here are a couple of links with more info .

As of late 2006 , cell phone unlocking became legal in the US , but do n't tell that to AT&T ; the company has unleashed the lawhounds on UniquePhones , a Belfast - based company that claims to have developed a software - only method to unlock the iPhone .
By trying to sell the software commercially , though , the company may have ensured that it will never see the light of day .
Let 's fire up Mr. Peabody 's Wayback Machine and jump to late 2006 , when the ability to unlock a cell phone became an American right ( for three years , at least ) .
The decision was made by the Library of Congress , which oversees a triennial rulemaking to establish exemptions to the DMCA .
In its 2006 ruling , the Library noted that phone companies were bundling digital locks with their handsets not in order to protect copyrights , but business models — not what the DMCA was meant to do .
" The underlying activity sought to be performed by the owner of the handset is to allow the handset to do what it was manufactured to do — lawfully connect to any carrier , " wrote the Library ( PDF ) .
" This is a noninfringing activity by the user . "
That decision has recently become even more important with the explosion of iPhone fever .
i Phones are only available on AT&T 's network , but there 's no technical reason why they can't function on any GSM network .
In the US , that means T - Mobile , but the options are far more plentiful in Europe and Asia .
Some European users have already gotten the iPhone up and running on local networks .
That 's why it's not surprising that Belfast - based UniquePhones would have developed iPhone - unlocking software .
But selling that software in America could be a dodgy proposition , as AT&T has made its displeasure clear .
Could it sue , despite the DMCA exemption that makes unlocking legal ?
Possibly .
Use , but do n't distribute
That 's because the DMCA exemption allows for using tools to unlock a phone but does not provide explicit protection for those who distribute such tools .
That could put companies like UniquePhones in AT&T 's legal crosshairs if they attempt to sell such software in the US .
So long as UniquePhones wants to profit by offering a commercial iPhone unlocking product , AT&T can halt distribution by bringing pressure to bear on the company .
Should the company release its tool ( in either open - or closed - source versions ) into the wild , stopping its spread would be impossible ; one need look no further than the recent AACS key fiasco or the DVD industry 's attempt to bottle up DeCSS to see why .
Unlike most phones , the iPhone is n't being heavily subsidized by AT&T , so it 's not clear why the company should have the right to control what people do with a product they have purchased for hundreds of dollars .
Would computer owners pick up an iMac that only worked with AT&T's DSL service ?
The situation just shows up the DMCA 's convoluted absurdities in unusually stark relief .
While the law has done plenty of good — just think of what the " safe harbor " provisions have meant for ISPs and startups like YouTube — reform is still needed .
Allowing consumers to unlock their own property ( especially when it's not subsidized ) but not allowing them to purchase the tools to do so is the sort of situation that belongs only in Kafka , not in modern rulemaking .
And do n't forget : the exemption for unlocking cell phones must be granted every three years .
That means it must be defended anew at great time and expense .
In the last rulemaking , the CTIA ( a trade group representing wireless carriers ) filed its comments after the deadline , and they were not allowed .
You can bet they 'll be better prepared in another two years , at which point even this one consumer - friendly exemption could vanish .

The Ron Paul campaign has generated a lot of excitement , especially among young people .
It has made political history by raising more money in a single day than any other presidential campaign , ever .
It has inspired thousands and given hope to those who had given up on politics altogether  as well as thrilling longtime libertarians who have been laboring in the vineyards all these years and have n’t seen anything like this before .
On the other hand , it has inspired  if that ’s the right word  a counter - movement , an anti-Paul coalition that extends from the extreme Left to the neoconish Right , and all points in between .
What ’s interesting is that the lies told by these anti-Paulistas amount to pretty much the same tiresome mantra , no matter what the politics of the perpetrator , and it amounts to this :
Paul is a secret neo -Nazi .
I kid you not .
How , you may ask , does someone invert reality to such a degree that the kindly country doctor , whose good name is a byword for integrity and principle , suddenly is turned into a monster with a hidden agenda ?
Well , it is n’t easy , and they ’re having a really hard time of it
The anti-Paul Popular Front is wide - ranging , extending from the neocons over at the Weekly Standard and the editorial offices of National Review to the left - wing Web sites priming their readers for Hillary ’s candidacy  and leading , finally , to the lair of something called the American National Socialist Workers Party ( ANSWP ) , a neo -Nazi outfit run by a weirdo by the name of Bill White .
White ’s contribution to the smear campaign is a cock - and - bull story , posted on the Vanguard News Network forum , which claims that Paul and his aides have regularly met with neo - Nazi nut - jobs such as himself , supposedly at a series of dinner meetings organized in Washington , D.C. Says Fuehrer White :
" Comrades :
" I have kept quiet about the Ron Paul campaign for a while , because I did n’t see any need to say anything that would cause any trouble .
However , reading the latest release from his campaign spokesman , I am compelled to tell the truth about Ron Paul ’s extensive involvement in white nationalism .
" Both Congressman Paul and his aides regularly meet with members of the Stormfront set , American Renaissance , the Institute for Historic [ sic ]
Review , and others at the Tara Thai restaurant in Arlington , Virginia , usually on Wednesdays .
This is part of a dinner that was originally organized by Pat Buchanan , Sam Francis and Joe Sobran , and has since been mostly taken over by the Council of Conservative Citizens .
" I have attended these dinners , seen Paul and his aides there , and been invited to his offices in Washington to discuss policy .
" For his spokesman to call white racialism a ‘ small ideology ’ and claim white activists are ‘ wasting their money ’ trying to influence Paul is ridiculous .
Paul is a white nationalist of the Stormfront type who has always kept his racial views and his views about world Judaism quiet because of his political position .
" I do n’t know that it is necessarily good for Paul to ‘ expose ’ this .
However , he really is someone with extensive ties to white nationalism and for him to deny that in the belief he will be more respectable by denying it is outrageous  and I hate seeing people in the press who denounce racialism merely because they think it is not fashionable .
" Bill White , Commander , American National Socialist Workers Party "
To begin with , who the heck is Bill White ?
Here ’s what the Anti-Defamation League of B’nai B’rith has to say about him : " Along with his media savvy , " they aver , " White is known for spreading propaganda and lies about his perceived enemies . "
Go here for his extensive criminal record .
White started his career as a dingbat of renown with the founding of the Utopian Anarchist Party when he was just a lad .
The UAP ’s 15 minutes of fame occurred after the Columbine High School shootings , when White or one of his wacked - out confreres issued a statement praising the shooters .
This guy loooooves attention , and he got plenty of it when , after his evolution into a Sieg - Heiling , uniform - wearing neo -Nazi , he published the addresses and home phone numbers of the Jena Six .
His " career " as a major nut reached its zenith with his leadership in the National Socialist Movement , which at one time claimed to be the biggest collection of losers and criminal misfits since George Lincoln Rockwell and his gang first blighted this country with their presence .
But that outfit blew apart , mostly on account of White ’s penchant for factional manipulation , and this effort to derail the Paul campaign is this would - be mini-Hitler ’s latest claim to fame .
Secondly , the man who organized the dinner meetings " Commander "
White refers to , Peter Gemma , has this to say :
" I ran those dinners  Ron Paul was never there If Bill White ever came to the meetings , he did n’t use his real name  he does n’t even get the name of the restaurant correctly . "
There ’s nothing worse than a sloppy smear , but then again , Paul ’s enemies are n’t too particular about the quality of the slime they sling at him .
Charles Johnson , the anti-Arab fanatic who runs the Little Green Footballs Web site , has absolutely no compunctions about teaming up with a neo -Nazi goofball like White if it serves the purpose of discrediting Paul .
Yet by acting as a megaphone for a crazy person , Johnson only winds up discrediting himself .
Oddly , it turns out that Johnson the ardent Zionist and White the goose - steppin ’ Nazi have an awful lot in common : hatred of Paul and of libertarianism  and that clearly outweighs the hatred they have for each other .
Yes , it ’s all about hate , and that ’s the irony of it : these people accuse Ron of being a hater , but if we investigate the perfervid fever swamps of anti-Paulism , the one emotion that hits us in the face , like a blast of hot , fetid air , is pure , undiluted malevolence .
( Just go here , if you can stand it , and breathe that fetid air ! )
Of course , White deals in hate .
His whole identity and crazed persona as the second coming of Adolph Hitler is wrapped up in bile and brazen evil : another " outsider " gone bad .
Yet if we go to the other side of the spectrum and meet White ’s opposite number , we see the same bile , expressed in the same style .
I want you to meet Victor Vancier , AKA Chaim Ben Pesach , head of something called the Jewish Task Force , a splinter group originating in the extremist Jewish Defense League :
If this was just another Internet clown parading around on YouTube making a fool out of himself , well , that would be one thing .
But Vancier is no ordinary clown .
He is a follower of the late Rabbi Meir Kahane , whose Kach movement is an officially designated terrorist organization , and Vancier is a convicted terrorist himself .
In 1987 , he was arrested and charged with masterminding several bombings .
He was convicted , along with his co-conspirators ( though one committed suicide ) , and sentenced to 10 years in prison .
In this context , Vancier ’s declaration that Ron Paul ’s supporters deserve to be killed is ominous in the extreme .
The hate just jumps off the screen and comes right at you .
In this sense , Vancier reminds me of Bill White !
They both have a penchant for stormtrooper - semi-military drag , violent hyperbole , and the sort of hectoring , wide - eyed hysteria and outright viciousness that repels any ordinary human being but attracts fellow miscreants and social rejects .
In short , they ’re both crazy , and in practically identical ways .
But that ’s not all they have in common : both hold ideological grudges against Paul and his fellow libertarians .
Vancier hates
Paul ’s foreign policy views , which he sees as a threat to Israel .
White , who has attacked libertarians  and myself in particular  resents Paul ’s success because the good Dr. No has a non-racist , nonviolent , anti-collectivist explanation and solution for what White and his fellow Nazi nutsos attribute to a nonexistent " Jewish conspiracy "  the Federal Reserve , bank credit expansion , and subsequent waves of bankruptcies and foreclosures .
Paul offers his growing audience of politically and often economically disenfranchised voters a rational explanation in the insight of the Austrian economists and the works of Ludwig von Mises , while White and his tiny cadre of National Socialist Workers look to the discredited pages of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion .
The Don Black donation brouhaha involves $ 500 from someone who is a top leader of the Stormfront Web site made under extremely suspicious circumstances .
Black ’s last known political activities were undertaken on behalf of George W. Bush during the Florida recount , when Black and his fellow racist crazies drove Jesse Jackson off the stage during a Democratic Party rally .
The Black contribution was soon discovered by the anti-Paulistas , who demanded that Paul return the " tainted " money  and , presumably , undergo sensitivity training under the aegis of the Southern Poverty Law Center .
Paul , however , refuses to return the Black donation , and rightly so : after all , he ’s not spending the $ 500 to advance , say , Holocaust denial or any objectives that could even remotely be connected to neo -Nazism .
He ’s spending it on promoting his own program of economic freedom , individual liberty , and a non-interventionist foreign policy .
Anyway , who put the anti-Paulistas in charge of vetting each and every contribution to the Paul campaign  and why should Ron concede that role to them ?
Over 70,000 people gave this quarter  is the campaign supposed to comb through each and every one of those names and vet them for political correctness ?
Naturally , the Paul - haters would answer " Yes "  they ’d love to see the campaign consumed with policing itself according to their strictures .
What exposes this as a brazen attempt to set up Dr. Paul for a smearing is the publication at Little Green Footballs of photos showing Don Black and his son standing next to Ron  at an event where the candidate was easily accessible to one and all and hundreds of people were in attendance .
Anybody could  and did  walk up to the candidate , and , never having met Black to begin with , Paul did n’t know him from Adam .
It is ludicrously transparent that Paul is getting a bum rap on this obviously staged incident .
This reminds me of an odd occurrence that took place years ago at the Long Beach convention of the Reform Party that nominated Pat Buchanan for president .
I had come out onto the front courtyard of the hotel to catch a smoke or two and was conversing with some of the delegates , when someone with a camera approached me and said : " Justin , someone would like to meet you . "
I did n’t know the guy , but , being a friendly sort , I said " Sure , " and in the next moment I was face to face with a wizened old guy with gray skin and huge ears who held out his hand and said " I ’m Willis Carto . "
At that moment , the guy with the camera was getting ready to snap a photo , but I turned away in time .
If that was n’t an ambush , then it sure felt like one .
( A photo of me turning away from the camera was subsequently published in Carto ’s anti-Semitic rag , The Spotlight , with some kind of crazy caption detailing how " sodomite Justin Raimondo , editorial director of Antiwar.com , spreads his deviant lifestyle at the Reform Party convention , " or something to that effect . )
Surely Black , as the leader of a neo - Nazi group , is very well aware that his " support " is hardly welcome and would actually hurt Paul : Stormfront members discussed this openly when " Commander "
White posted his statement .
For Black to publish those photos on his own site when he knew they would be immediately picked up by the anti-Paul witch - hunters ’ brigade  the controversy over his donation was already in progress  pretty much demolishes the idea that he is any kind of Ron Paul " supporter . "
With supporters like that , Ron does n’t need any enemies .
Essentially , Black did exactly what White did and what professional witch - hunters such as David Neiwert and neocon idiot Michael Medved have tried to do , and that is to smear a good man who does n’t have a racist bone in his body as a " white supremacist . "
What ’s even more ludicrous is the accusation of " anti-Semitism . "
Let ’s be clear about this : no libertarian , particularly of the Rothbardian variety , of which Paul is one , could possibly entertain the idea of becoming an anti-Semite .
In order to do so Paul would have to repudiate his two primary intellectual mentors and guiding lights : Murray Rothbard and Ludwig von Mises , both of whom were Jewish .
Indeed , this is what led White to attack Antiwar.com and libertarians in general in a screed that described us as a " Jewish think tank "  because our webmaster and several employees are Jewish .
Oh , and I am supposedly " one quarter Jewish , " which White should tell my Sicilian grandparents .
" Commander " White is just the kind of tar baby the War Party would love to stick Ron Paul with , and it ’s a role he ’s played in the past .
Who can forget Stephen Schwartz ’s crazed piece in Frontpagemag.com describing me as a " fascist " and linking me to yes , that ’s right , our old " friend " Bill White .
Schwartz wrote of " Raimondo ’s prominent association with the Russian Jew - baiting website , Pravda.ru , and its American contributor , the neo- Nazi Bill White , " but the reality is that there was never any association , prominent or otherwise .
Schwartz points to articles by me posted on the Pravda Web site , where White ’s diatribes  sometimes attacking me  also appeared .
Yet I never gave my permission to Pravda to post my work on their site , and the moment I saw that my columns were appearing next to White ’s diatribes , I demanded that Pravda cease and desist , which , to their credit , they did .
The point is that , in the case of Ron Paul , the tar - baby method of smearing someone has been used again , with the same tar baby but a different victim .
When the " he ’s a 9/11 Truther " meme did n’t take , the smear campaign got really down and dirty with the Paul ’s - a - Nazi theme .
Given Paul ’s most un - Nazi - like ideology and demeanor , however , this one is n’t going to fly , either .
This has all the marks of a coordinated hit job , and although I would n’t venture to guess who ’s doing the coordinating , it seems clear to me that the Republican Establishment is frightened to death of an independent run by Paul in the general election  a possibility Paul has n’t completely ruled out .
By marginalizing him now before he cuts into the GOP base , they can save themselves a lot of trouble  and if they have to get in bed with a lot of truly sleazy types , such as Messrs .
White and Black , well , then , that ’s why they call them " dirty tricks . "
No bag of tricks , no matter how dirty , is going to be enough to stop the Ron Paul Revolution : his appeal is only increasing , along with his visibility , and smear campaigns like the one exposed above are only going to cause thinking people to wonder what the smear - mongers are so afraid of .
What they ’re afraid of is that the politics of principle represented by Paul and his followers will finally get a hearing , in the debates and on the campaign trail , on account of the millions of dollars contributed by Paul ’s supporters nationwide in a spontaneous and truly phenomenal outpouring of donations and independent activism .
The sheer breadth of the anti-Paul Popular Front is an astonishing sight to behold , extending all the way from avowed Nazis to radical Zionists , from Noam Chomsky to Glenn Beck .
Both Fox News and the International Socialist Organization are out for Paul ’s scalp  and you can tell an awful lot about people by their enemies .
What this tells me about Ron Paul is that he ’s just what many people on both sides of the political spectrum have been waiting and hoping for .
As reported in the Guardian , last Thursday a 26 - year - old Cheltenham man was arrested and the site , tv-links.co.uk , was closed .
According to the Gloucester police , the arrest was carried out for alleged violations of Section 92 of the Trade Marks Act .
The man was not charged and the case remains under investigation , says Eddy Leviten of the Federation Against Copyright
Theft .
He likened the activity of TV Links to someone who advertises a car that is not theirs .
" The main issue is that the original material is stolen , " he alleges .
TV Links was collecting links to movies such as the new Nancy Drew film that were allegedly illegally recorded in the cinema and then hosted on Chinese websites , he said .
The federation is pursuing the websites that host the material , but it is difficult to pursue sites not under English jurisdiction .
The law governing the case is not clear .
Section 92 of the Trade Marks
Act is frequently used by the federation to pursue illegal CD and DVD copiers , but lawyers said the act relates to goods and has not been applied to audio- visual material that is not on a physical disc or other storage media .
Under US law and the MGM v Grokster case in 2005 , the US Supreme Court found Grokster liable for " inducement " , encouraging others to infringe copyright .
However , English law does not recognise inducement .
But this case turns on the issue of linking and the Trade Marks Act .
Out -law.com , the blog of international law firm Pinsent Mason says : " It is not clear how the provision of links will be prosecuted as a criminal offence . "
Alex , writing on the Impact blog from UK law firm Freeth Cartwright , agrees .
" On the facts that we know so far , it is difficult to see how the providing of links to infringing copies of TV shows gives rise to a civil or criminal liability under UK law , " he said .
The Trade Marks
Act may not fit the alleged crime .
" The Trade Marks Act makes the unauthorised use of trade marks in relation to goods an offence ; but this is a law that was written to catch counterfeit goods , " said Kim Walker , head of intellectual property at Pinsent Masons .
" The provision of links is surely a service , not a sale of goods .
It seems an unlikely way to deal with the problem . "
Alex at Freeth Cartwright says : " Such links might constitute an offence under other parts of copyright law ( distributing infringing copies or communicating copies to the public in the course of business ) , but it is again difficult to see how the facts meet these offences . "
La question ne semble plus être qui de SFR , de Bouygues Telecom ou d'Orange va remporter le contrat visant à commercialiser en France l'iPhone d'Apple avec un abonnement mobile associé ... mais quand Orange envisage de le mettre sur le marché .
En effet , alors que ni Apple France ni Orange se sont exprimés officiellement au sujet de l'iPhone depuis sa sortie aux Etats - Unis le 29 juin dernier , différentes sources indépendantes rapportent que le premier baladeur communicant de la marque à la Pomme serait bel et bien commercialisé en France à la rentrée prochaine .
Ainsi , selon l'agence Relaxnews , l'iPhone « serait lancé en France avec l'opérateur Orange , dans la foulée du salon Apple Expo , qui se tiendra à Paris du 25 au 29 septembre 2007 » .
Selon le site MacScoop cette fois , les négociations entre Apple et Orange sont terminées depuis le mois dernier , Orange France prévoyant déjà de commercialiser son iPhone dans l'Hexagone dans le courant du mois de novembre .
Plus encore , un stock de 50 000 iPhone pour le lancement du terminal en France serait envisagé chez Orange alors que la Fnac pourrait distribuer une partie des iPhone en partenariat avec
Orange , pour améliorer ses points de présence locaux .
A noter que la seule annonce officielle concernant la sortie de l'iPhone en Europe est en provenance d'Apple .
La société précisait en effet à la fin du mois dernier que l'iPhone sera lancé sur le Vieux continent avant la fin de l'année dans la plupart des pays « majeurs » , même si ce terme n'a pas été explicité .
Selon les dernières rumeurs , les pays qui pourraient l'accueillir en 2007 seraient l'Angleterre ( avec O2 ? ) , l'Allemagne ( avec T - mobile ? ) et la France ( avec Orange ? ) .
BAGHDAD , Iraq - Iraq 's divided political leadership , in a rare show of unity , skewered a non-binding U.S. Senate resolution approved in Washington , D.C. , last week that endorses the decentralization of Iraq through the establishment of semi-autonomous regions .
Also on Sunday , the U.S. Embassy joined the Iraqi politicians - both Shiite and Sunni - in criticizing the resolution .
The measure 's advocacy of a relatively weak central government and strong Sunni Arab , Shiite and Kurdish regions has touched a nerve in the Iraqi political arena , stoking fears that the United States is planning to partition Iraq .
" The Congress adopted this proposal based on an incorrect reading and unrealistic estimations of the history , present and future of Iraq , " said Izzat al - Shahbandar , a member of secular ex-prime minister Ayad Allawi 's parliament bloc .
He was reading from a statement also signed by Iraq 's pre-eminent religious Shiite Muslim parties and the main Sunni Arab bloc .
" It represents a dangerous precedent to establishing the nature of the relationship between Iraq and the USA , " the statement said , " and shows the Congress as if it were planning for a long - term occupation by their country 's troops . "
In the U.S. Embassy 's highly unusual statement , it said resolution would seriously hamper Iraq 's future stability .
The non-binding power - sharing measure was approved in Washington on Wednesday , and resentment appears to be building daily in Iraq .
Approved by a 75 - 23 margin , it supports a " federal system " that would create sectarian - dominated regions .
The genesis of the resolution is the proposal by Sen. Joe Biden , D - Del. , and Council of Foreign Relations president emeritus Leslie Gelb .
The pair have been advocates of dividing the country up along ethnic and regional lines .
Backfires in Baghdad
The federalization idea , backed by some Democrats , is one of many proposals floated in the United States , where the public has become disenchanted with the continuing violence in Iraq .
But whatever the intended effect by the Senate lawmakers to wade into the debate , the effort has backfired in Baghdad , where the resolution has been interpreted in light of Iraq 's history of foreign occupation from the Ottoman empire to Britain and America .
Iraqi political parties that have been deadlocked for months have rallied to defend the country 's sovereignty and to defeat any effort by another country to shape Iraq 's fate .
" We refuse the resolutions which decide Iraq 's destiny from outside Iraq .
This is a dangerous partitioning based on sectarianism and ethnicity , " said Hashim Taie , a member of the Iraqi Accordance Front , the parliament 's main Sunni representation .

Radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr 's political supporters joined their rivals in denouncing the U.S. Senate 's measure .
" This project is the strategic option for the American administration in its failure to igniting a sectarian war inside Iraq , " Nasr Rubaie said .
" They started to search for a replacement , which is to divide Iraqi . "
Federalism has long proved a charged topic for Iraq .
The Sadrists still are seeking a strong national government .
The Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council , another large Shiite political faction , also has started to downplay the idea of further weakening an already frail national government .
Leery of American intervention , Rubaie said the powers of the provinces and regional blocs should be defined once the United States has pulled its troops out of Iraq .
Plays on worst fears
Joost Hiltermann , a Middle East expert at the International Crisis Group think tank , cautioned that the Senate proposal had played on some of the worst fears of Iraqis and other Arab states .
" In Iraq and the Arab world , the word partition is an anathema associated with the worst aspects of imperialist policy , " Hiltermann said .
Over the weekend , U.S. and Iraqi forces killed more than 60 insurgent and militia fighters in intense battles , with most of the casualties believed to have been Al - Qaida fighters , officials said Sunday .
U.S. aircraft killed more than 20 Al - Qaida in Iraq fighters who opened fire on an U.S. air patrol northwest of Baghdad , the U.S. command said .
Iraq 's Defense Ministry said in an e-mail Sunday afternoon that Iraqi soldiers had killed 44 " terrorists " over the past 24 hours .
The operations were centered in Salahaddin and Diyala provinces and around the city of Kirkuk , where the ministry said its soldiers had killed 40 and arrested eight .
It said 52 fighters were arrested .
In a separate operation , U.S. forces killed two insurgents and detained 21 others during weekend operations against the Al - Qaida group .
The U.S. military also announced the death of a U.S. soldier killed Saturday in a roadside bombing and gunfire attack in eastern Baghdad .
There were 62 U.S. military deaths in September , the lowest monthly toll since July 2006 when 43 U.S. soldiers were killed , according to a preliminary Associated Press tally .

The smug - causing star of Oceans 9 10 11 and his girlfriend Sarah Larson were injured on Friday when Clooney crashed the motorcycle they were on while driving on a narrow road across the Hudson River in Jersey .
Clooney 's reportedly suffered a broken rib and Larson broke her foot .
Both have been released from the Palisades medical center where they 'd been treated .
According to Sgt. Sean Kelly , the Weehawken police officer in charge of the investigation :
" Clooney and Larson were traveling north and sped up to pass on the right of a 1999 Mazda Millenia that was preparing to make a right turn . "

Although there 's apparently some question as to whether the Millenia was looking to go right or left , there 's no dispute that passing on the right , as it is pretty much everywhere with left - hand drive cars , is a no - no .
Clooney 's spokesman Stan Rosenfeld , obviously upset with having to work on erev Yom Kippur is telling it like it is
" The car signaled left .
George was riding to the right .
The driver decided to make an abrupt right turn and clipped George ... "

Or not — what does " riding to the right " mean ?
Whatever — fear not though , because we 're hearing the movie he 's filming with Brad Pitt in Jersey is not " Oceans 14 " and unfortunately , it 's expected to be right on schedule .

Kevin Drum quotes the LA Times ' analysis : " More than any other question , Republican presidential candidates are asking voters to consider a single issue in the weeks before primary voting begins :
Who detests illegal immigration the most ? "
Indeed , but what 's a bit hard to see is why they 're doing this ?
I know there are some people here in DC who seem convinced that the Republicans can ride the immigration issue to victory in 2008 , even though this is exactly the strategy they tried in 2006 , and the evidence suggests that people do n't care very much about immigration :
That 's from the latest Washington Post poll where they asked people to name the two issues they thought were most important .
It 's clear that the public 's main priorities are national security ( to wit : Iraq and terrorism ) and the deteriorating economic situation .
Only ten percent see immigration as one of the two most important issues .
Now if you assume that about 33 percent of the population are Republicans , and also that all ten percent of the people who are naming immigration are restrictionist Republicans ( and this is clearly an overestimate -- some restrictionists are Democrats , and some people who think immigration is important are n't restrictionists ) that 's still only thirty percent of Republicans putting a high priority on immigration restrictionism as an issue .
As the Post puts it , " Overall , five issues , including immigration and health care , reach double digits as top one or two concerns among Republicans " but they barely say anything about these other issues -- instead they quibble about who 's a real conservative , they talk smack about Hillary Clinton , and they brag about how much they hate immigrants .
It 's bizarre .
E.J. Dionne 's right that " a backlash against illegal immigration could help some Republicans running for Congress " but could help some people running for congress seems like a thin rationale for making an impractical and inhumane stand on an issue of secondary concern to the public the centerpiece of your party 's political strategy .

I was connecting my 9 - year old little brother ’s
Wii to the wireless network when it occurred to me he ’d never played , nor even heard of , Super Mario Bros .
His idea of classic gaming is Ratchet and Clank .
So I dropped $ 5 on a download , turned the remote around in his hands , and stepped back .
He walked straight into the goomba on his first life but then realized he could jump over them , and soon found with glee that falling on one killed it .
Being the type that picks up every last bolt in Ratchet despite my groaning protestations , he turned to take out the goombas he ’d leapfrogged past .
“ Why ca n’t I go back ? ” he asked .
“ Because you can ’t . ”
“ But why ? ”
“ Dude , you just can ’t . ”
Further investigating the leftward wall , he kicked a koopa shell behind him .
It came back .
I winced as he walked past the 1 up mushroom between the hill and the pit , and felt a great sense of pride when he discovered how to run across one - block wide holes .
I was tempted to show him the 1 - 2 warp zone , but I ’m sure he ’ll find it soon .
It ’s not every day you get to look through eyes seeing Super Mario Bros for the first time .
I highly recommend it .
After twenty years of highly decorated service in the U.S. Army Special Forces , David Boone thought he knew the rules of engagement .
But that was before he found himself back in the shit — Baghdad 's Green Zone , to be precise — and working for the private sector .
In the emerging world of outsourced warfare , the rules are n't always well defined .
They can be , like money , endlessly fungible .
Almost three years ago , Boone , a Westminster resident , was fired by MVM , a private firm that holds lucrative contracts in Iraq and elsewhere to provide security services for American government officials .
The ostensible reason for the termination was that he " did not fit in " with the rest of his six - man detail providing escorts in Baghdad under a Department of Defense contract .
But a lawsuit Boone filed claims that he was dumped because he refused to go along with an " after - action " report that lied about a 2004 firefight with insurgent snipers — an account designed to cover up the fact that a member of the team had fired indiscriminately into a residential building .
Filed in Adams County , Boone 's lawsuit was soon moved to Denver 's federal court at the request of Virginia - based MVM , which has denied Boone 's allegations .
After two years of legal maneuvers , a trial date still has n't been set .
Some of the documents in the suit have been sealed , and even the identity of the specific government agency that is MVM 's client under the contract is considered classified .
But public records in the case raise disturbing questions about the conduct of private security companies in Iraq and the lack of oversight by the government agencies that employ them .
Info U.S. Army Special Forces
Similar questions have been raging on Capitol Hill since September 16 , when employees of Blackwater USA , another private security force , were involved in a shooting in a Baghdad square that left at least eight Iraqi civilians dead .
( Some accounts place the death toll at 28 or more . )
A recent congressional report found that Blackwater 's 861 employees in Iraq have been involved in at least 195 shooting incidents since 2005 — typically firing first from moving vehicles and not stopping to assess the damage .
The company , headed by ex-Navy SEAL and wealthy Republican contributor Erik Prince , is now the subject of several federal investigations .
MVM 's operations in Iraq are not on the same scale as Blackwater 's billion - dollar contract , but the company is still a significant player among the 180 security firms doing business in what has become the most privatized war in American history .
Founded by former Secret Service agents in the early 1980s , MVM reported more than $ 200 million in revenue last year ; in 2004 , the company sold off its corporate security division and now concentrates entirely on government contracts , which range from guarding American embassies and running detention centers for illegal immigrants to providing transport for VIPs in Baghdad .
Boone first went to work for MVM in the war zone in the spring of 2004 .
The job paid up to $ 860 a day plus expenses — roughly $ 75,000 for a ninety - day deployment .
His team , the Scorpion PSD ( protective services detail ) , was assigned to escort " high - level personnel and visitors " from the Baghdad airport to the American embassy and other locations in the international zone .
His lawsuit claims he resigned after his first ninety - day rotation over concerns about the conduct of less - experienced team members , but agreed to return that fall , after two team members were removed and he was promised a guaranteed three rotations .
On November 20 , 2004 , the Scorpion team delivered clients to the airport and was returning to the Green Zone in a two - vehicle convoy .
A car bomber pulled a U - turn on a six - lane freeway overpass and detonated in front of the team 's armored Ford Excursions .
According to MVM 's after - action report , the team was then fired upon from buildings adjacent to the overpass : " Periodically gunmen were seen , and engaged , as they moved on the rooftops and in the windows and balconies . "
A U.S. Army unit that came to the aid of the convoy also came under fire from a sniper , who was then " neutralized " by one of the MVM team , the report states .
But Boone 's written account of the incident maintains that there was no enemy fire on the convoy .
The tail gunner in his vehicle began firing five - to seven - round bursts into an " upscale " residential building south of the highway despite the lack of incoming fire , he says , triggering additional .50 - caliber bursts and rounds of grenades directed at the building from the Army unit that soon arrived on the scene .
" While I continued trying to identify the threat [ the MVM gunner ] was engaging , the Army element called out , ' Someone tell that guy to stop shooting , ' " Boone wrote .
" I relayed the Army 's cease - fire order . "
None of the Scorpion members were seriously injured in the incident .
Boone 's complaint alleges that team members later bragged to government clients of having faced twenty or more shooters during the firefight and killing three .
Boone claims he took his objections to his superiors , along with concerns about other alleged violations of company standards of conduct .
He reported a suspected affair between a team member and a married female soldier , as well as illegal weapons , including AK - 47s and hand grenades , that he alleges had been purchased and stored by MVM employees .
His lawsuit contends that the company 's decision to terminate him , two days before he was supposed to return to Baghdad from Colorado for another ninety - day rotation , was in retaliation for his whistleblowing efforts .
MVM 's lawyers have responded that Boone was not an employee but an independent contractor , and that his termination was a matter of expedience rather than retaliation .
In the alleged firefight , Boone " failed to engage the enemy , " they contend .
Boone attorney Thomas Stocker 's response : " It is simply incredulous to believe that a twenty - year Special Forces veteran , highly trained in anti-terrorism skills , would not engage the enemy — if there were any enemy to engage . "
The company has sought to have the case moved from Denver 's federal court , arguing that it belongs in an Iraqi courtroom .
But in addition to breach of contract , Boone is also claiming that he was fired for exercising " his legal rights as an American citizen to object to illegal and wrongful behavior " — and that , U.S. District Judge Phillip Figa ruled , is an appropriate matter to be decided under Colorado employment law .
" Iraq has no interest in the outcome of an employment dispute between a Colorado citizen and a California corporation with its principal place of business in Virginia , " Figa wrote .
" [ Boone ] has alleged MVM fired him for performing an allegedly important public obligation and required him to forsake a public duty in order to remain employed . "
An attorney for MVM declined to comment on the case .
Stocker , Boone 's attorney , declined to discuss specifics of the lawsuit but said his client 's claims are no different than those of whistleblowers in other professions .
" If you believe there 's been wrongdoing and report that to your company and get fired for it , that 's retaliation , " he says .
Boone has since returned to security work in Iraq with another company .
His offer to settle the case for $ 975,000 was rejected by MVM .
A settlement hearing is scheduled for early next year .
Dr Morgan said fundamentalism left ' no room for debate '
He focused on what he described as " atheistic fundamentalism " .
He said it led to situations such as councils calling Christmas " Winterval " , schools refusing to put on nativity plays and crosses removed from chapels .
The National Secular Society has said Christians in the UK have " nothing to complain about " .
In his Christmas message , the archbishop said : " Any kind of fundamentalism , be it Biblical , atheistic or Islamic , is dangerous . "
The archbishop said " atheistic fundamentalism " was a new phenomenon .
He said it advocated that religion in general and Christianity in particular have no substance , and that some view the faith as " superstitious nonsense " .
God is not exclusive , he is on the side of the whole of humanity with all its variety
Archbishop of Wales , Dr Barry Morgan
As well as leading to Christmas being called " Winterval , " the archbishop said " virulent , almost irrational " attacks on Christianity led to hospitals removing all Christian symbols from their chapels , and schools refusing to allow children to send Christmas cards with a Christian message .
He also said it led to things like " airlines refusing staff the freedom to wear a cross round their necks " - a reference to the row in which British Airways ( BA ) suspended an employee who insisted on wearing a cross necklace .
Dr Morgan said : " All of this is what I would call the new " fundamentalism " of our age .
It allows no room for disagreement , for doubt , for debate , for discussion .
Only one in five schools perform a traditional nativity , say bishops
" It leads to the language of expulsion and exclusivity , of extremism and polarisation , and the claim that , because God is on our side , he is not on yours . "
He said the nativity story in St Luke 's Gospel , in contrast , had a " message of joy and good news for everyone " .
He said : " God is not exclusive , he is on the side of the whole of humanity with all its variety . "
Dr Morgan said it was " perfectly natural " to have a " coherent and rational debate about the tenets of Christianity " .
But he said " virulent , almost irrational " attacks on it were " dangerous " because they refused to allow any contrary viewpoint and also affected the public perception of religion .
This month community cohesion minister Parmjit Dhanda said the UK should " celebrate " the role of Christianity in the country 's heritage and culture .
His comments came after Mark Pritchard , Conservative MP for The Wrekin , called a Westminster debate on " Christianophobia " , saying attempts to move Christian traditions to the " margins " of British life had " gone far enough " .
Greens EFA , a coalition of two political parties that currently have 42 seats in the European parliament , have launched a pro-filesharing campaign named " I Would n't Steal " .
Their goal is to counter the anti-piracy propaganda put forward by the entertainment industry , and encourage people to download and share .
The message put forward by the parties is pretty strong : “ Whenever you rent a movie , the multinational media industry forces you to watch their propaganda .
They claim that downloading movies is the same as snatching bags , stealing cars or shoplifting .
That ’s simply not true , making a copy is fundamentally different from stealing . ”
Greens EFA claim that the entertainment industry exploits artists and sell propaganda , and want to make the public aware of this .
We could n’t agree more of course , and it is good to see that these established political parties are attempting to decriminalize filesharing .
As they write : “ The media industry has failed to offer viable legal alternatives and they will fail to convince consumers that sharing equals stealing .
Unfortunately , they have succeeded in another area , lobbying to adapt laws to criminalize sharing , turning consumers into criminals . ”
In collaboration with RÃ¥FILM the parties created a short clip for the campaign .
which they made available on BitTorrent by uploading it to The Pirate Bay .
It ’s beginning to look like things are finally starting to change , politicians are not scared anymore to embrace BitTorrent sites such as The Pirate Bay , and stand up for people ’s right to share culture .
The Pirate Bay is of course delighted by the campaign and even updated the logo on their frontpage to show their support .
Pirate Bay ’s Brokep told TorrentFreak : “ I love that there are smart people that understand how the world works and I ’m gonna support them with whatever means I can ” .
Let ’s hope the entertainment industry is paying attention as well .
If the virus could not reproduce normally in a given well , it suggested that the missing protein was one of those it needed .
Of the 273 human proteins identified , only 36 had been previously found by other methods .
The virus , which is itself only a short string of genetic material inside a protective capsule , can make only 15 proteins , so it has to adopt human proteins to its own use .
The advantage of targeting human proteins is that the virus would presumably not be able to mutate to avoid drugs that block them , Dr. Elledge said .
Right now , virus strains evolve resistance to antiretroviral drugs , which attack the 15 proteins made by the virus itself , like reverse transcriptase and protease .
The mutations force AIDS patients to switch drug regimens  not always successfully .
The disadvantage is that blocking human proteins can , obviously , be fatal to humans .
But , as Dr. Gallo pointed out , cancer therapy works that way  doctors try to block proteins that feed fast - growing tumor cells without killing too many other fast - growing cells , like those in the bone marrow .
Right now , Dr. Elledge said , only one drug that targets one of the known human proteins , a receptor called CCR5 , has been developed , and it has just won approval .
The new screening technology , known as siRNA , is now used in many laboratories , so this work could theoretically have been done elsewhere , or by using older , more laborious methods .
Dr. Elledge said he benefited from working at Harvard , which could afford the expensive robotics and imaging technology needed .
Subluminal shows how a wave composed of a multitude of frequencies moving at different velocities — all less than or equal to c , the speed of light in a vacuum — can appear to have features moving faster than c .
The grid that crosses the screen is moving with a velocity of c , and no individual frequency outpaces it .
However , the total wave ( the bottom trace , in white ) has its strongest peaks where all the individual frequencies are in phase , and the places where that happens shift with time , at a “ speed ” that is greater than c .
Nothing is actually travelling with these peaks , though ; they ’re just an artifact of the way the different frequencies are slipping in and out of phase .
This illusion of superluminal motion can only occur when the refractive index of the medium falls as the frequency of the light increases , a situation known as anomalous dispersion .
If it falls rapidly enough , the group velocity — the speed at which the overall envelope of the wave seems to move — can even become negative .

But whatever the precise shape of the waves that are generated as the shutter is closed , they ca n’t travel faster than the fastest phase velocity that occurs in the medium ( which will not exceed c ) , so they ca n’t catch up with a pulse travelling at the group velocity and modify it in any way .

Here is the optical illusion about a lady turning clockwise or anti-clockwise … depends how your brain interpret the images … the results are amazing …
How many people saws the lady turning clockwise or the lady turning anticlockwise ?
What ’s more common ?
Here I try to answer that question with a survey or poll about that .
Do you see the dancer lady turning clockwise or anti-clockwise ?
always clockwise
always anti-clockwise
both but mostly clockwise
both but mostly anti-clockwise
both similar View Results

Supposedly if you see the lady turning clockwise , then you use more your right side of the brain and if you see the lady turning anti-clockwise , then you use more your left side of the brain .
In the original news says that the most of us see the lady turning anti-clockwise .
This is apparently wrong if we look at the results of the survey .

Maxwell was a regular in the Bond series for over 20 years
Maxwell starred alongside Sir Sean Connery in Bond 's first movie outing , Dr No , in 1962 .
She played the role until 1985's A View To A Kill with Sir Roger Moore , who told the BBC she had been a " great asset " to the early Bond movies .
A spokesperson for Fremantle Hospital , Western Australia , said she died there on Saturday evening .
I think it was a great disappointment to her that she had not been promoted to play M - she would have been a wonderful M
Sir Roger Moore
007 star pays tribute
' Always fun '
She appeared in more movies than any of the actors who played the lead role in the spy series , including Sir Sean Connery and Sir Roger Moore .
Only Desmond Llewelyn , who played gadget man Q 17 times before his death in 1999 , starred in more films .
" It 's rather a shock , " Sir Roger , who had known her since they were students at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art ( Rada ) in 1944 , told BBC Radio 5 Live .
" She was always fun and she was wonderful to be with . "
" She was absolutely perfect casting , " he said of her role as Miss Moneypenny .
" It was a great pity that , after I moved out of Bond , they did n't take her on to continue in the Timothy Dalton films .
HAVE YOUR SAY
She will always be remembered as the best Miss Moneypenny

Sir Roger said she had moved to Australia to be with her son after being diagnosed with cancer .
Born Lois Hooker in Ontario , Canada , in 1927 , her acting career started in radio , before she moved to the UK with the Entertainment Corps of the Canadian army at the age of 15 .
Golden Globe
In the late 1940s , she moved to Hollywood and picked up a best newcomer Golden Globe for her part in Shirley Temple comedy That Hagen Girl .
Lois Maxwell appeared in 14 Bond films from 1962 to 1985
As well as her 14 outings as Miss Moneypenny , she also appeared in Stanley Kubrick 's Lolita and worked on TV shows including The Saint , The Baron , Randall and Hopkirk ( Deceased ) , The Persuaders ! and Department S.
Aged 58 when she made her final Bond appearance , she was replaced by 26 - year - old Caroline Bliss for The Living Daylights .
As well as her acting career , she also worked as a columnist for the Toronto Sun newspaper .
Her last film role was in the 2001 thriller The Fourth Angel , alongside Jeremy Irons and Jason Priestley .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- HSBC Holdings ' $ 35 billion bailout of its structured investment vehicles puts pressure on a group of rival banks that are working on a broader solution to one of the major sources of this year 's global credit crisis .
HSBC HBC , +0.48 % said Monday that it 's moving Cullinan Finance and Asscher Finance , two structured investment vehicles , or SIVs , onto its balance sheet to prevent forced sales of what it called " high - quality assets . "
Britain 's largest bank by market value is providing up to $ 35 billion in funding , and its balance sheet will expand by $ 45 billion .
See full story .
“ ' The intent [ of a plan jointly created by Citigroup , Bank of America and J.P. Morgan Chase ] is to create a solution for situations like this , but it 's not in place yet , so HSBC was left to decide for itself . ' ” — James Moss , Fitch
The SIV market , a roughly $ 300 billion business , is at the center of the current credit crisis .
The vehicles borrow money short term and use the cash to buy longer - term debt .
The longer - term assets usually pay higher interest rates than the short - term debt , and money is made on the difference .
SIVs invest in a variety of fixed - income products , but they have some exposure to securities partly backed by U.S. subprime home loans , such as mortgage - backed securities and collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs ) .
As defaults surged on subprime mortgages this year , confidence in these products wilted , and SIVs struggled to refinance short - term debt .
That sparked concerns that the vehicles would be forced to sell hard - to - value assets like CDOs into illiquid markets at severely depressed prices .
That , in turn , could damage the value of similar assets held by others , such as banks , brokers , hedge funds , insurers and pension funds .
On Oct. 15 , Citigroup Inc. C , - 2.12 % , Bank of America Corp. BAC , - 1.32 % and J.P. Morgan Chase JPM , - 0.84 % unveiled a joint plan to try to head off this potentially damaging scenario , under the guidance of the U.S. Treasury .
The three banks agreed to create a fund called the master liquidity enhancement conduit -- or M - LEC , popularly identified as a " superfund " -- that would buy some of the SIVs ' highly rated assets .
The plan , scheduled to be up and running by mid-January , could help SIVs avoid having to sell assets quickly to pay off their short - term debt , providing stability and liquidity to credit markets , the group explained .
But HSBC 's decision to deal with its SIV problems alone shows M - LEC is being set up too late for some SIVs and the vehicles ' bank sponsors .
" When the plans for M - LEC were outlined , the banks anticipated potential situations like the one HSBC is in , " James Moss , managing director and head of Fitch 's North America financial institutions group , said .
" The intent is to create a solution for situations like this , but it 's not in place yet , so HSBC was left to decide for itself . "
It may also suggest that some banks would prefer to retain 100 % control over the destiny of their SIVs and are wary of getting involved with M - LEC .
That 's a problem because the plan needs other banks to take part for it to be big enough to have an effect on the SIV market and broader credit markets , according to other experts .
" If this airplane gets off the ground , it will probably crash before it reaches its destination , " said Joshua Rosner , a managing director at research firm Graham Fisher & Co . " I still do n't believe it will get off the ground . "
Citi pressure
HSBC 's move also puts pressure on Citigroup , Rosner added .
Citi created the first SIV in 1989 , and it's now the largest bank sponsor of SIVs , with roughly $ 90 billion of exposure , according to Deutsche Bank data .
“ ' Whereas HSBC has the balance sheet to allow them to do this , Citigroup and Bank of America do n't . ' ” — Joshua Rosner , Graham Fisher & Co .
If HSBC , the second - largest SIV sponsor , can bail out its vehicles alone , why has n't Citi done the same thing ?
" Whereas HSBC has the balance sheet to allow them to do this , Citigroup and Bank of America do n't , " Rosner said .
It 's less dire than that , according to other experts , who say Citi and Bank of America just may not want to allocate so much capital to one area .
Fitch 's Moss said Citi has the flexibility to take all of the SIVs it sponsors onto its balance sheet .
A spokeswoman for Citi declined to comment , while a spokesman for Bank of America did n't return a phone message left seeking comment .
Still , Citi shares have been hit hard in recent weeks by concerns about whether the bank has enough capital .
Analysts at CIBC World Markets said in early November that Citi may have to raise more than $ 30 billion , whether by selling assets , slashing its dividend or a combination of measures .
See full story .
Citi has already bought $ 7.6 billion of its SIVs ' maturing short - term debt but said in a recent quarterly regulatory filing that such support would stop at $ 10 billion , Fitch noted .
" Any additional support may increase the likelihood of a downgrade as its capital ratios are already under pressure , " the rating agency wrote in a Nov. 14 report on banks ' exposures to the SIV market .
Balancing act
One reason M - LEC may be struggling is that the banks involved are attempting a delicate balancing act , Fitch 's Moss and others said on Monday .
Publicly available details on the plan are scarce and have n't been finalized yet , so it 's still unclear exactly what M - LEC will be or do .
At one extreme , M- LEC could be a vulture fund that buys only the best assets from SIVs and then unwinds once the liquidity crisis is over .
This means it might make a big profit .
But it may not solve the problem of SIVs being forced to sell the rest of their lower - quality holdings .
" As you liquidate the balance sheet of your entity , it takes on the consistency of concrete as the liquid securities are sold and the impaired credit quality / illiquid securities and the ' OK ' credit quality / illiquid securities remain , " Brad Hintz , an analyst at Bernstein Research explained .
" At some point , as you shrink your balance sheet , the only alternative is to attempt to sell the illiquid concrete -- that is where M - LEC may help , " he added in an e-mail .
" Perhaps M-LEC will take or finance the ' OK ' credit quality / illiquid securities which helps -- but that does n't solve the problem for the banks . "
At the other extreme , M - LEC could be a bailout fund that will buy a lot of SIVs ' assets .
This may stabilize the broader credit markets , but may mean M- LEC and the three sponsoring banks are left with losses .
" They do n't want to do this at a loss , but the issues being discussed are not just centered on profits , " Moss said .
" Getting broad stability sooner rather than later produces many more profit - making opportunities in so many markets for banks and that goes beyond just making M - LEC profitable . "
Answering a Twitter challenge issued Tuesday by Jake Dobkin to beat his $ 26,820.90 Mac Pro configuration , Jason Kottke over at Kottke.org was able to crank up the price of his Mac Pro to $ 27,340.90 .
Not bad .
Jason admits to throwing in all the optional software and accessories , but still , that there is $ 27,000 computer – which Apple says qualifies for free shipping .
As he notes , the really expensive accouterments were the 32 GB of RAM ( $ 9100 ) , the NVIDIA Quadro FX 5600 video card ( $ 2850 ) , the four 15,000 RPM hard drives ( $ 800 each ) , the two 30 - inch Cinema Displays ( $ 1700 each ) , a Fibre Channel Card ( $ 1000 ) , and the unlimited - client copy of Mac OS X Server ( $ 999 ) .
We here at EPICENTER love a challenge ( if we can cheat ) , so I decided to try to beat Jason 's price and maybe put Al Gore 's Mactastic rig to shame , too .
In the end , I 'm happy to report I was able ring up a $ 29,889.53 bill .
My secret ?
Expedited shipping , fools !
People Need Both Drugs and Faith to Get Rid of Pain Researchers have discovered how the brain releases opioids in the placebo effect
Aug. 1 , 2007  --
In one startling drug study in the 1980s , a young woman who had been virtually homebound by the energy - sapping effects of chronic fatigue syndrome had a miraculous recovery .
But , it was n't the drug that cured the patient – she was in the trial group that was taking sugar pills .
It was the " placebo effect , " — a well - documented phenomenon that has intrigued doctors for decades .
When patients believe a drug will help them , they sometimes heal themselves .
" She and her parents were so excited about her profound improvement , " said Janet Dale , a staff scientist at Clinical Investigation at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases .
" And she sustained her health and continued to be well . "
It 's human nature , explained the study scientists , who reported nearly 50 percent of the participants on placebos got better .
But now , with advances in neuroscience , researchers at Columbia University and the University of Michigan have been able to see how the placebo effect works .
When volunteers were convinced they were receiving pain medicine , their brains actually released natural relief , or opioids .
" It is the first time we have been able to directly observe placebo - induced pain relief , " said neuroscientist Tor Wager of Columbia University , whose findings also showed that drug effectiveness is enhanced by the power of the mind .
" We usually think a drug does something to you , but there are examples in which the drug does n't do anything unless we have the correct belief , " he said .
" You need both the chemical and faith that the drug will work . "
" We 're not there yet , " said Wager , but this discovery could change the treatment of pain and disease .
One day doctors might be able to determine which patients are more responsive to placebos and use lower doses of powerful medicines that can cause side effects and allergies .
The study , which was published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , " is another piece of evidence that the person is not just changing the way you say you feel , but how it is processed in the brain , " said Wager .
The word " placebo " is Latin for " I will please . "
Placebos like sugar pills , distilled water or saline solutions have been used for decades in drug research and by doctors .
In a 1955 ground - breaking paper , " The Powerful Placebo , " researcher H.K.
Beecher concluded that one - third of all patients responded to a placebo .
In later studies , when patients were told they were taking stimulants , their blood pressure and pulse rates rose ; when they thought they were taking sleeping pills , they fell .
But the most significant research in placebos has been seen in the treatment of pain relief .
In some studies up to 75 percent of patients responded to sugar pills , according to the Food and Drug Administration .
" Placebo groups are included in virtually every major clinical trial , which is a testament to their importance , " said Wager .
" Only in the past few years have scientists developed the tools to directly investigate how placebos work in the human brain . "
Morphine Mimics the Brain
Doctors have used the chemical opiate morphine to treat pain for two centuries , so scientists like Wager have theorized that if morphine " mimics what the brain does naturally , the brain must have its own internal chemical . "
In the placebo study , Wager and his colleagues tested 15 volunteers with two " pain relieving " creams — one had an active ingredient and the other was inert .
The creams looked identical and both were applied on the forearm .
Researchers applied a thermode — or hot plate — against the skin , giving a sequence of painful stimuli , similar to a hot cup of coffee .
Volunteers were asked to rate the pain .
During the experiment the volunteers ' brain activity was monitored with positron emission tomography ( PET ) .
Scientists were looking for differences between reported pain and brain activity .
When the placebo cream was applied , volunteers were told " this is a proven pain - reliever , " and that it would work , explained Wager .
" We wanted to make sure to convince them so they really believed it blocked pain when they were stimulated on the placebo - treated skin site . "
The PET scans revealed activity in both the frontal cortex – the area of the brain that controls conceptual knowledge , and in the periaqueductal gray area – the region that governs basic responses to threat and is involved in pain suppression .
Earlier placebo research used magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) to look at the brain , but PET scans now let these scientists look directly at the nerve chemistry of the brain and its opioides .
Drug companies have long known the power of placebos , according to Scientific American .
" It is why drug companies sue each other over the right to have a purple pill rather than a blue one ? " a 2004 article asked .
" Blue pills have the connotation of sadness and could n't possibly , to the placebo - induced mind , make us better .
It 's called ' trade dress , ' and the shape of the pill — the color , the size — accounts for the efficacy of a pill sometimes as much as what is in it . "
In drug trials , scientists must inform volunteers when they are given placebos , but some ethicists worry that when used outside research , placebos can undermine the essential trust between patient and doctor .
Doctors Called ' Con Artists '
Some even go so far as to call doctors " con artists " for prescribing placebos for panic attacks , migraines and other complaints .
At Winthrop - University Hospital on New York 's Long Island in 1999 , an intern gave a patient complaining of pain a saline injection rather than an active drug .
The hospital 's ethics committee prompted a survey published in the Western Journal of Medicine that showed interns admitted ordering placebos for patients 10 times over two years .
" I have no issue with using placebos with patients as long as a physician indicates that this may be part of their practice so that a general consent to the use of placebo is obtained , " said Dr. Arthur Caplan , director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania .
Every patient needs to know the drugs they are taking if they change doctors or move , said Caplan .
Physicians also need to keep careful records of placebo use .
" Sometimes talking to the patient and calming them down is a placebo , " said Caplan .
" Sometimes offering an aspirin can be a placebo .
And many prescription drugs carry a placebo effect . "
Joan McGregor , professor of philosophy and bioethics at Arizona State University , agrees that the mind can influence the body , citing the power of prayer , meditation and social groups .
" We waste a lot of money on drugs and invasive therapies when we could go in another direction , " said McGregor .
" We ought to be studying this and harnessing the power of the mind . "
The placebo study is a start , according to Columbia 's Wager , and it may eventually give scientists insight into why many drugs have a range of effects on people , how drugs and other treatments work together with psychological states , and how psychology can be effectively used in treatment .
" The human brain not like a machine , but like a river with a lot of ongoing processes , " said Wager .
" What you do when you give someone a drug is you nudge that and produce all sorts of ripple effects . "

Unitarian Universalism is a liberal religious tradition that was formed from the consolidation of two religions : Unitarianism and Universalism .
In America , the Universalist Church of America was founded in 1793 , and the American Unitarian Association in 1825 .
After consolidating in 1961 , these faiths became the new religion of Unitarian Universalism through the Unitarian Universalist Association ( UUA ) .
Both religions have long histories and have contributed important theological concepts that remain central to Unitarian Universalism .

A quick and sweet tip for one of those things surprisingly difficult to get right in emacs : buffer scrolling .
If you find awkward the way emacs makes your buffers jump when you move the cursor near their begin or end , try putting this file in your load path and ( require ' smooth - scrolling ) .
You can control when scrolling starts by setting the variable smooth - scroll - margin : when the cursor is that far from the top or bottom borders , scrolling begins ( default is 10 lines ) .
Works like a charm here .
By the way , as Adam ( the author of the code above ) points out in the comments below , the problem is trickier than it seems .

Operating system - oriented website OSNews reports about an open - source operating system from Nintendo , titled ES .
The website for the OS reveals that it was made public on August 30 , 2006 , though it only hit version 0.1 on October 11 of this year .
According to OSNews , the first English - language site to pick up on the system , ES " runs natively on x86 ( and qemu of course ) , kernel is written in C++ , uses an ECMAScript interpreter for all of the userland , uses Cairo for graphics , and even has a port of [ programming language ]
Squeak .
" The OS is a ' research system , ' meaning that there is no specific application for it at present , and is being used for experimentation .
However , a story commenter on Gamedev.net theorizes : that it could be the framework for something like Microsoft 's XNA , and is certainly expandable to platforms other than PC with a little work .
The commenter , ' ravyne2001 ' postulates : " Officially , it 's simply a " research operating system . "
Something Nintendo is toying with and which may or may not lead to an eventual release in much the same way that Nintendo has always been in constant hardware development ... " " The working theory " he continues , " seems to be that this OS might be the early stages of something similar to Microsoft 's XNA -- basically a sandbox environment which offers hardware acceleration and a userland based on some form of VM execution , ECMAscript in this instance .
Although the current build is against X86 , it could be ported over to PPC to run on the Wii , for instance .
" For now , the operating system is laid bare to the public , which OSNews commentors seem to think is designed with broad adoption and simplicity in mind .
Though all documentation - including a full technical paper [ PDF ] on the project is in Japanese , all necessary source code is downloadable .
An official English - language abstract regarding the project is as follows :
" We propose an extensible component operating system architecture in which an operating system kernel uses reflection to process C++ pure virtual function based system calls and upcalls to provide a unified programming environment for application , server , and kernel development .
We found that we could even develop file subsystems and a TCP / IP protocol stack on an existing operating system based on this architecture .
"
The official ES website is being updated regularly , with the Squeak port implemented only days ago .
A COUPLE were banned from taking photographs of their baby daughter on a swing by a park warden who declared it `inappropriate . '
Steve Brook and partner Mandy Smith were having a family day out with 11 - month - old Rebecca when the council worker swooped .
" It beggars belief , " said Steve , 35 .
" The fact that a mummy and daddy can't take a picture of their own daughter is ridiculous .
I could understand if it was in a swimming pool , but she was well wrapped - up and as far as I could see we were the only people in the park . "
Town hall officials said the warden had misinterpreted council policy when he confronted the family at Alexandra Park in Oldham .
But Phil Woolas , MP for Oldham East and Saddleworth , said : " Based on these reports I am thinking of introducing a Bill to Parliament called The Common Sense Act 2007 .
" We are in danger of becoming so adverse to risk we will lose sight of common sense . "
Steve , an off - licence manager from Clarksfield in Oldham said : " A man in a high - visibility jacket came over and told us we could n't take pictures .
I asked him why and he said it was illegal to take pictures of children in the park .
I explained it was my own daughter but he still said it was n't allowed . "
A council official said : " We are committed to ensuring that all our parks are safe and welcoming places for all visitors .
To ensure this happens staff are instructed to be observant and aware of the activities of park users and consider whether they are appropriate .
" This incident was due to the incorrect interpretation of policy by a member of our security staff who has since been made aware of his actions . "
There are no national guidelines banning parents from taking photographs of children in parks .
The first serious attempt to ban photographs of children in public was made in March this year at Vale of Glamorgan council in south Wales .
The council proposed `that no photographs , filming or other imaging shall take place of children or young people in parks and open spaces without written permission . '
Councillors threw out the proposal , saying it would be too difficult to enforce and that parents should n't need permission for pictures of family picnics .
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - A mentally ill paraplegic man filed a lawsuit on Thursday against a hospital that dumped him in a gutter on Los Angeles ’ “ Skid Row ” -- a case that highlighted the plight of the city ’s vast homeless population .
Gabino Olvera , 42 , sued the Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center for negligence after it discharged him in February 2007 , took him across town in a van and left him in a soiled hospital gown without a wheelchair in the heart of the city ’s homeless area .
Witnesses who came to Olvera ’s aid said they saw him dragging himself on the ground with hospital papers and documents clenched in his teeth while the driver sat in her van and applied makeup before driving off .
The incident was captured by security cameras at a nearby homeless shelter .
Hernan Vera , a lawyer with Public Counsel , which helped bring the lawsuit on behalf on Olvera , called it “ the most obscene and callous example of this practice that we have seen . ”
The lawsuit was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court and seeks unspecified damages .
Hollywood Presbyterian said in a statement it had thoroughly reviewed its patient discharge policies to ensure nothing of the sort ever happened again .
The hospital added it had held extensive talks with Olvera ’s lawyers and remained optimistic about reaching a satisfactory out - of - court settlement .
The Olvera case was one of about 50 reported incidents in the past 12 months of sick , confused and homeless patients being left by ambulances in the 50 - block area of downtown Los Angeles thought to have the highest concentration of homeless people in the United States .
Estimates of the number of homeless in the United States ranges from 500,000 to more than a million .
In Los Angeles , an estimated 12,000 people , many of them mentally ill or addicted to drugs and alcohol , live and sleep on the streets of the area known as Skid Row .
Vera called Los Angeles “ ground zero in the fight against unlawful dumping of homeless patients by hospitals . ”
Lawyers for Olvera said one of the goals of the lawsuit was to force local hospitals to change their practices .
In May , Kaiser Foundation Hospitals , the country ’s largest nonprofit health - care provider , settled a lawsuit involving the dumping of another patient by agreeing to find shelter places for all patients it discharges in Los Angeles .
Kaiser also agreed to improve discharge procedures and to contribute $ 500,000 to homeless services on Skid Row .
DoJ Was ' Used As A Political Sword Against Democrats ' According To Host Dan Abrams
Says ' It 's A Department Where Political Loyalty Trumped Experience , Qualifications And Objective Justice '

Guest Blogged by Alan Breslauer
The third installment of " Bush League Justice " on MSNBC Live with Dan Abrams continued last night with an investigation into how the DoJ has targeted Democrats for investigation and prosecution .
In fact , one study shows that Democrats have been investigated and prosecuted at nearly six times the rate of Republicans at the federal level .
According to the study 's author , the statistical possibility of this happening by chance is 1 in 10,000 .
Studies show that prosecutions on the state level are fairly even between Democrats and Republicans .
This is hardly surprising since the DoJ tracked which attorney 's " Exhibited loyalty to the President and Attorney General " and which were members of the ultra - conservative Federalist Society .
Evaluating attorneys based on whether they were " loyal Bushies " , according to former U.S. Attorney and current Senator , Sheldon Whitehouse ( D - RI ) , is " disgraceful " .
Also " troubling " to Abrams is the timing of investigations and prosecutions which often occurred right before elections , in violation of the DoJ 's own procedures manual .
When the Bushies were eventually caught doing so , they simply changed the manual .

It seemed to me to be one of the black arts , something you wanted to try but did n’t quite have the confidence to try …
” What happens if I wretch ? ” … ” If he cums in my mouth will I like it ? ” , so many questions , enough for me to decide that the guy who I try it with has to be trusted 100 % not to make fun of me but be encouraging and sensitive .
We were together in our flat and the moment just felt right , I knew I could trust Alex of all the guys I had been out with to be encouraging and thoughtful .
If I recall properly , we had been smoking weed and had a few drinks and Ted Nugent ( do n’t you just love the old rock songs ) was playing in the background .
I was laying across Alex ’s lap on the floor , best place to be when you are rolling joints and drinking , you can have everything around you .
Lol
We were both quite mellow and I decided to undo his jeans .
I popped the button , pulled down his zipper and reached inside his trousers .
His cock needed time to catch up with events , it was probably feeling mellow too .
Alex rolled over on to his back and wriggled out of his jeans , swiftly followed by his boxers .
I think he must have known what was on my mind .
Within moments he was naked from the waist down , just a t - shirt and his socks .
I took them off , ca n’t keep a straight face if a guy leaves his socks on . 🙂
His cock was semi hard and still resting against his groin .
I began to fondle his balls and roll them in my palm , whilst my left hand took hold of his cock .
Alex was looking very expectant as I pulled back his foreskin and opened my mouth .
He asked if I was sure I wanted to do this and I replied that it was fine .
Strange he did n’t ask me again .
😉
I recall looking at his stiffening cock and thinking , which way would be best to take him in to my mouth .
From what I had read I knew it was best to open up the throat as much as possible by straightening the alignment of my mouth and throat .
But I was n’t sure that I would be able to deep throat him , not without gagging .
I decided to lick and suck his cock until he was fully erect and then see how far I could take him .
Opening my mouth wide and pushing my tongue against the bottom of my mouth , opening my oesophagus I lowered my head over his pulsating member .
I got as far as the opening to my throat and then I started to gag , tears streamed down my cheeks .
But not being one to give in easily I kept on trying but just could n’t overcome the desire to puke .
Despite all the things I had read and the videos I had watched , it needed time and practice .
I was a little disappointed but I knew that persistence would pay off .
Alex was very patient and understanding and realised that I needed to quite literally back off .
He was also enjoying my sucking his cock and I continued to flick my tongue around his frenulum ( although I did n’t know what they called it then , just that it got a good response ) 😉 and down around his balls .
It was n’t long before Alex was bucking his hips up to my mouth as I sucked and licked and did everything I could to substitute for the deep throating I really wanted to give him .
Strange I had n’t even considered what I would do if he came , I was more interested in being able to suck him off .
I rolled his wet balls in my right hand and flicked , sucked , licked his erection in to submission .
Within minutes
Alex was announcing that he was going to cum .
It was then that it struck me …should I take him in my mouth and let him ejaculate ?… was I ready for that ?
Ejaculation was imminent and I enclosed my mouth around his throbbing penis and closed my eyes .
I felt the globules of cum hit my throat and begin to run down in to my mouth and throat .
A feeling of satisfaction came over me as I realised that I had just given my first blow job .
I could feel the warm cum on my tongue and I began to taste it , running my tongue against the roof of my mouth .
I wished I had n’t done that .
The taste made me balk again .
It was my first taste of cum and I did n’t care for it .
I had no option I swallowed hard and cleared my mouth .
Trying not to spoil the moment for Alex who had a supercilious smile on his face as he lay prostrate on the floor .
When he came round he was on cloud nine .
It took me two whole days to tell him that I did n’t like the taste .
And a couple more after that to get used to it and begin to enjoy the distinct flavour .
😉
You just ca n’t stop me now !

Two years ago when gasoline prices in the U.S. surged to the then - lofty level of $ 2 a gallon , the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries sprang into action , seeking to provide relief by pledging to boost oil production .
Now , with gasoline topping an average of $ 3.20 a gallon nationwide , OPEC officials say they see no reason to open ...
( Adds comments from State Street , data from S&P )
TOKYO , Nov 9 ( Reuters ) -
The trustee of a $ 1.5 billion collateralised debt obligation ( CDO ) managed by State Street Global Advisors has started selling assets , apparently starting a process of liquidation , Standard & Poor ’s said late on Thursday .
The news from the ratings agency raised worries of similar action on a wider array of structured securities , and stirred more fears about the exposure of U.S. financial institutions to credit markets .
It helped drive the dollar to a fresh record low against the euro in Asia trading and hit regional equity markets , traders said .
S&P said it slashed its ratings on Carina CDO Ltd ’s top tranche of securities by 11 notches to the junk level of BB from the top - notch triple - A after it received a notice on Nov. 1 saying that the controlling noteholders had told the trustee to liquidate .
S&P also chopped its ratings on the subordinate levels of the CDO , with two falling to CCC - and eight to CC .
The ratings were first assigned in November 2006 .
The trustee of the Carina CDO has started selling the asset - backed securities -- residential - mortgage backed securities and CDOs -- making up the CDO at the direction of the structure ’s noteholders , S&P said .
“ We believe the liquidation process has begun , ” S&P said in its statement .
CDOs repackage assets ranging from mortgages and credit - card receivables to corporate bonds into securities .
The tranches of a CDO are divided so returns depend on credit risk , with the lowest tranches the first to suffer from any asset defaults .
State Street declined on Friday to say whether the CDO it manages is being liquidated .
However , the bank ’s spokeswoman said any decision to liquidate the CDO and the financial liability from that lie with the principal note holder , not State Street .
Ratings agencies have slashed the ratings of many CDOs and structured securities this year as surging defaults in U.S. subprime mortgages and the resulting credit crunch have hit the value of their underlying assets .
Last month , S&P put 590 ratings on 176 CDOs -- including those on Carina -- on watch for a possible cut , affecting $ 20.6 billion in debt .
The ratings cut on the Carina CDO is more severe than would be justified by the deterioration of the underlying assets because a decision to liquidate would depress prices and affect all notes that were issued , S&P said .
S&P said the ratings on the top two parts of the CDO would only be trimmed by one or two notches if the liquidation notice were withdrawn , but any selling will lead to material losses and market prices may not recover during the liquidation period .
The liquidation notice follows an event of default notice on Oct. 22 , which occurred after a collateral trigger in the structure was tripped .
That notice led Moody ’s Investors Service to slash its ratings on Carina on Oct. 30 .
S&P said 14 CDOs have received such default notices , twice as many as the agency said had received the notices a week ago .
But it said it had only received a notice of liquidation for Carina , not the other 13 .
Credit analysts at Bank of America Securities said in a note to clients this week they expect more hefty asset write - downs tied to CDOs as “ valuation uncertainty and further market erosions will imply continued increased losses . ”

Jupiter : Protection from Incoming Comets ?
Jupiter ’s protective role for Earth has long been assumed , the theory being that the giant planet deflects asteroids and comets away from the inner Solar System .
But studies on the subject are sparse , and focus on long period comets in extremely elliptical orbits .
What about short period comets , and in particular the Jupiter Family of Comets ( JFC ) ?
These are comets thought to originate in the Kuiper Belt whose orbits are now controlled by Jupiter .
Comet 81P / Wild 2 , encountered by Stardust , was one of these , as was Comet Shoemaker Levy - 9 .
We all saw in 1994 what a planetary impact from a comet could do when Shoemaker Levy - 9 struck Jupiter .
And a new study suggests that Jupiter ’s presence offers Earth no real protection from such objects .
A research team at the UK’s Open University set up computer models that examined the Jupiter Family , defined for these purposes as comets whose semi-major axes are smaller than Jupiter ’s and whose orbital period is less than twenty years .
Some studies indicate that the so - called ‘ Centaurs , ’ icy objects which cross the orbits of the giant planets , are in transition between the Kuiper Belt and the Jupiter Family of Comets .

The role of Jupiter in slowing its pace is now being reassessed .
Credit and copyright : Julian Baum .
Assuming the Centaurs as the parent population for the JFCs , the team set up a computer simulation that could track 100,000 Centaurs around the Solar System over a period of 10 million years .
The model ’s parameters were first adjusted to include a Jupiter at current mass , and the model was then run with planets at three - quarters , one - half , and one - quarter the mass of Jupiter .
A final simulation was run with no planet in Jupiter ’s position at all .
The result :
The cometary impact rate with Jupiter in place is comparable to the rate when no planet exists in that position at all .
What does change the rate of impacts is to assume a Jovian mass between these two extremes , in which case the rate goes up .
Jonathan Horner ( Open University ) , who presented these results at the European Planetary Science Congress in Potsdam today , has this to say :
“ We ’ve found that if a planet about the mass of Saturn or a bit larger occupied Jupiter ’s place , then the number of impacts on Earth would increase .
However if nothing was there at all , there would n’t be any difference from our current impact rate .
Rather than it being a clear cut case that Jupiter acts as a shield , it seems that Jupiter almost gives with one hand and takes away with the other ! ”
The simulations indicate that without Jupiter , these short - period comets will not be diverted onto Earth - crossing orbits in the first place , whereas a Saturn - mass planet ( about a third the mass of Jupiter ) would have the gravitational pull to draw such comets into Earth - crossing orbits ( as Jupiter does ) , but would not be massive enough to later eject them from the Solar System as readily as Jupiter .
Thus we wind up with more objects on Earth - crossing orbits — and more impacts — at any given time .
Does the ‘ Jupiter as shield ’ hypothesis still hold up for long - period comets ?
And what role does the giant planet play in the risk of asteroid impact ?
The team is now at work on the asteroid question , and plans to address the long - period comets after that .
But the notion that a solar system needs a gas giant analogous to Jupiter to protect its inner planets may need serious re-examination , even as we continue to study the danger posed by Earth - crossing objects of all kinds .
In case you missed it , Friday ’s Wall Street Journal ran( 12/21/2007 ) an article on “ Dr. No ’ on it ’s front page by author Sarah Lueck .
No , it was not about Ron Paul .
It was about Senator Tom Coburn , from Oklahoma , and how he has caused gridlock in the Senate this year .
I expected at the very least a mention of Ron Paul the Presidential candidate , who is better known as “ Dr No ” from the House of Representatives .
No mention of Ron Paul in the entire story .
Google “ Ron Paul ” and “ Dr. No ” , and there are over 23,000 pages found .
Google “ Tom Coburn ” and “ Dr. No ” , and you will find 620 pages .
You will also find via the Goggle search that on February 12 , 2006 that George Will wrote a column titled The Senate 's Dr. No .
There is simply no way to not question the timing of this story .
Less than two weeks before the first caucus , the WSJ , which has had 21 months to run this similarly themed column to George Will ’s , chose to run it now ?
And not just now , the Friday before the major holiday week of 2007 , where any letters to the editor will have the lowest potential readership of the year ?
One major difference is that the WSJ version used the word “ gridlock ” often to describe the results of the Senator ’s actions , while George Will did not .
There are several other references I would also find less than flattering for a candidate running for any office .
Making it even more confusing for readers ( and voters ) , Coburn also happens to be an obstetrician , just as Ron Paul is .
In the middle of a primary season , the WSJ runs an article on a politician who is not running for reelection , who upon a casual glance , appears like another candidate who is running for president ?
Is this a coincidence ?
No .
No to the highest degree .
It 's difficult to comprehend how the editorial board of the WSJ justified front page space for a politician not even seeking the attention , while the most important race in our nation starts January 3 , 2008 .
If you read the WSJ article on Coburn , you will see the confusion they are trying to generate with Ron Paul .
Looking back at the Wall Street Journal 's front page for December , here is what I found :
On December 3rd , they ran a column on Barack Obama .
On December 4th , they ran a column called “ Economy Moves to Fore as Issues for Voters ” .
There was no mention of candidate Ron Paul .
On December 5th , there was a column on campaign fundraising .
There was no mention of candidate Ron Paul .
With Ron Paul 's success this last quarter , they failed to mention him ?
An oversight ?
On December 8th , there was a column on Hillary Clinton .
On December 17th , there was a column on Mike Huckabee .
There was no mention of candidate Ron Paul .
On December 20th , there was a column on the Iowa caucus .
No mention of candidate Ron Paul .
Yet on December 21st they run a column about a Dr No , who is not candidate Ron Paul .
And I did not see columns on any other politicians NOT running for an office in 2008 .
Please let the WSJ know you are upset about what they are trying to do .
This attempt to create confusion about Ron Paul is disingenuous to say the very least .
We must also question their motives .
This blatant attempt to generate voter confusion is another attempt of Mainstream media to block Ron Paul ’s Presidential campaign .
And if you were not aware , the Wall Street Journal has been bought by Rupert Murdoch 's News Corporation .
News Corp. also owns FoxNews , and we know that they have been no friend of the Ron Paul Campaign .
Please let Mainstream media know that they will not be successful with these types of media misdirection .
With or without them , the Ron Paul story will be told , and it will be told truthfully .
Main Street America will not have the wool pulled over our eyes .
I have written the author of the story questioning it 's timing .
I look forward to the response .
Watching the Meetup emails for Ron Paul , I know there are efforts to contact the media and get stories in the major publications .
I seriously doubt the Senator fro Oklahoma was seeking this media coverage at this time .
I am hoping that a response from the author of Friday 's story could shed some light on this for me .
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
Models are paid millions to twirl in the latest bra and panty set .
Right ?
Nope -- not unless they are one of an extremely small ( and beautiful ) handful of young women .
Last year , models made a median hourly wage of $ 11.22 , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , a bit less than twice the minimum wage of $ 5.85 .
Not so glamorous .
" Most models take other jobs .
They 're waiters .
It gives them the flexibility to go to model calls and auditions , " said Ean Williams , executive director of DC Fashion Week , a designer showcase held twice a year in the nation 's capital .
" There are a lot of people that are very beautiful , very talented , that do n't make it in the business . "
The young and beautiful are n't the only ones working like dogs and earning peanuts .
In fact , models , demonstrators and product promoters rank No. 8 on a new list of the 10 worst jobs in America .
Who gets the shortest end of the stick ?
Coffee shop hosts and cafeteria counter attendants , according to a report by the Center for Economic and Policy Research and the Center for Social Policy at the University of Massachusetts .
Eighty - seven percent of restaurant - host and counter - attendant jobs were categorized as " bad , " meaning they paid less than the median wage in 1979 , adjusted for inflation , and had neither employer - sponsored health insurance nor a retirement plan .
That translates to a wage today of $ 16.50 an hour or $ 34,320 per year for a full - time , full - year worker , according to the report .
About 79 % of jobs in the models , demonstrators , and product promoters category are bad , according to the report , which covers 2003 through 2005 using Census Bureau data .
John Schmitt , a senior economist with CEPR , said the categories heavily composed of bad jobs have n't improved in recent years .
" The composition is basically the same .
It 's not like suddenly it 's a different world for people , " he said .
In 2005 , almost one - third of American workers had a job that met all three bad criteria , about the same share as in 1979 , according to the report .
" Even worse , despite substantial economic growth since the end of the 1970s , the share of bad jobs in the U.S. economy has remained essentially unchanged for over a quarter century , " according to the report .
Quite a few of the bad job categories are those that might typically be considered summer jobs for teenagers or students trying to save for a car or help pay for school .
Many are in the service industry , with categories such as tour guides , ticket takers and dishwashers making it into the top 10 bad occupational categories .
Jobs typically found in food service took four of the 10 spots .
Getting dished on
Joseph , a 22 - year - old host at a restaurant popular for lunch near the White House who asked that his last name not be used , said his job , which pays his rent , also makes it easier to take classes as night .
However , mornings at the restaurant can be rough , he said .
" I find myself waking up in the morning with melancholy -- the malaise of doing the same job over and over , " he said , adding that dealing with people at their " worst , " i.e. making rude demands , can lead to anger and depression .
Joseph receives an hourly wage but no benefits , and there 's no tips pool of which he can take a cut .
The host added that the waiters , who have to deal with the kitchen staff , diners and the boss , have it even worse .
Darrell Luzzo , president of National Career Development Association , said even people in jobs that pay well and provide benefits can have extreme dissatisfaction .
A good career is one that matches your interests on top of providing adequate financial compensation , he said .
" There is a very weak link between the amount of earnings and benefits and true job satisfaction , " Luzzo said .
He added that people with jobs that do n't provide enough to meet a basic level of need should try to move on .
Federal job - training programs can help workers gain skills to find better employment .
" If [ a job ] is not providing shelter , food or health , you can't exactly find purpose in work , " Luzzo said .
The stresses of working at restaurants , especially , affect a substantial chunk of America : With 12.8 million estimated employees , the restaurant industry is the largest employer outside of the government , according to the National Restaurant Association .
By 2017 , the industry is expected to add 2 million jobs , according to NRA .
" The restaurant industry has been a jobs juggernaut in the economic expansion , " said B. Hudson Riehle , NRA 's senior vice president for research and information services .
" The industry has become a national training ground . "
' Bad ' is in the eye of the beholder
James Sherk , a fellow in labor policy at the Heritage Foundation , said jobs such as waiting tables can be a good opportunity .
" A lot of people are working part - time and in school .
The job gives the flexibility they need , " he said .
" Somebody who just graduated from high school is n't trying to support a family of four . "
Sherk should know -- he worked as a lifeguard as a teenager .
" It was fun , it was good work to do .
At the same time it does n't shock me that I was n't earning the equivalent of $ 30 an hour , " he said .
Randy Miller , founder and chief executive of career counseling firm ReadyMinds , said bad jobs can be good training , especially if a worker wants to advance in a particular field .
" I would n't see anything wrong with being a host or hostess .
You may work at a smaller restaurant , get the experience you need , and then go to a larger restaurant or hotel chain , " he said .
" It might be a very good starting point for someone young who has very high aspirations in that field . "
Not just young workers that are hurting
Yet for each top bad occupation , most of the workers are above 20 years of age .
For example , among wait staff , almost 17 % are 16 - to 19 - years - old , 33 % are between 20 and 24 , and 50 % are between 25 and 64 , according to CEPR 's Schmitt .
Lifeguards and other protective - service workers comprise the occupation category with the highest proportion of teenagers , reaching almost 48 % .
" Teenagers are an important part of some of the occupations , but in no case are they the majority of workers in the occupation , " Schmitt said .
" In most cases , teenagers are only a fairly small share of total employment . "
Women who have their first baby before 25 , as well as parents and other workers between 20 and 25 years of age , could use employer - sponsored health insurance , he said .
Yet few are receiving it .
" A substantial number of people in that age range have family responsibilities .
So having health insurance is a big deal , " Schmitt said .
He added that it's also important for young people to have a defined benefit or contribution plan :
" We 're constantly being reminded that people should start [ retirement saving ] when they start working . "
Occupations with the highest concentrations of bad jobs
Think Secret broke the news about the Mac Mini
The legal battle between Apple and the site blew up in January 2005 when Think Secret revealed details of the Mac Mini before its official unveiling .
Apple brought the lawsuit to make the fan site reveal who had leaked details about the cut - down computer .
By agreeing to shut down , the Think Secret site gets to preserve the anonymity of its sources .
Source code
In a statement about the deal Nick Ciarelli , Think Secret publisher , said : " I 'm pleased to have reached this amicable settlement , and will now be able to move forward with my college studies and broader journalistic pursuits . "
Apple declined to provide details of the settlement but a spokesman said it was " happy to have this behind us . "
Apple is notoriously secretive about forthcoming products and it sued Think Secret claiming that bloggers should not enjoy the same rights to protect sources granted to mainstream journalists .
A California court initially sided with Apple but the hi-tech firm lost the case on appeal .
The outcome of that said bloggers should be considered as journalists and subject to the same protections .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) aided Think Secret in its legal fight to stop Apple forcing it to reveal its sources .
" I hope that Apple takes from this that it is neither useful nor wise to sue its fans , " said Kurt Opsahl , an attorney for the EFF .
Mr Ciarelli started Think Secret when he was 13 years old and is now a student at Harvard University .
The name of the website is a play on the " Think Different " slogan Apple once used in its advertising .

In my quest to get to know Opera a little bit better — even if I have used it way before Mozilla became popular — I ’ve snooped around the most delightful Opera Widgets I could find .
The great thing about Opera Widgets is that they load right after downloading them ( unlike Firefox where an add - on or a theme will only take effect upon restart ) .
Also , because they are widgets and not browser extensions , they are free - floating and can interact with things other than your web browser .
Example : a ruler widget can measure other objects on your screen and not just websites .
Third and probably most appealing of all is that they ’ve got an awesome community .
Opera ’s got a slew of competitions that encourage widgetmakers to do their very best .
The down side is that they only work with the browser running ( disappointed ?
get Yahoo !
Widgets , successor to the legendary Konfabulator and Windows equivalent to OS X Dashboard Widgets ) .
But with widgets this cool and a browser this slick ( memory leak - free and fast ) , what ’s keeping you from using Opera ?
Disclaimer : I ’ve skipped the usual stuff you ’d expect to be widgetized ( even if these binary clocks tickled my brains a bit ) .
The widgets below caught my eye since they ’re brilliant creations .
They ’re mostly geeky , too .

If the statistic one in 166 has a familiar ring , perhaps that 's because you recently heard it on a television commercial or read it in a magazine .
According to widely publicized estimates , one in 166 is now the proportion of children who suffer from autism .
This proportion is astonishingly high compared with the figure of one in 2,500 that autism researchers had accepted for decades .
Across a mere 10 - year period -- 1993 to 2003 -- statistics from the U.S. Department of Education revealed a 657 percent increase in the nationwide rate of autism .
Not surprisingly , these bewildering increases have led many researchers and educators to refer to an autism epidemic .
Representative Dan Burton of Indiana also declared in 2001 that we have an epidemic on our hands .
But what 's really going on ?
Before we explore this question , a bit of background is in order .
Autism is a severe disorder that first appears in infancy .
Individuals with autism are characterized by problems with language , social bonding and imagination .
All suffer from serious communication deficits , and some are mute .
They do not establish close relationships with others , preferring to remain in their own mental worlds .
They engage in highly stereotyped and repetitive activities , exhibiting a marked aversion to change .
About two thirds of autistic individuals are mentally retarded .
For reasons that are unknown , most are male .
The causes of autism remain enigmatic , although studies of twins suggest that genetic factors play a prominent role .
Still , genetic influences alone cannot account for such a rapid and astronomical rise in a disorder 's prevalence over a matter of just a few years .
As a consequence , investigators have turned to environmental factors for potential explanations .
The causal agents proposed include antibiotics , viruses , allergies , enhanced opportunities for parents with mild autistic traits to meet and mate , and , in one recent study conducted by Cornell University researchers , elevated rates of television viewing in infants .
Few of these explanations have been investigated systematically , and all remain speculative .
Are Vaccines the Problem ?
Yet one environmental culprit has received the lion 's share of attention : vaccines .
At first blush , vaccines would seem to make a plausible candidate for the source of the epidemic .
The debilitating symptoms of autism typically become apparent shortly after age two , not long after infants have received vaccinations for a host of diseases .
Indeed , many parents claim that their children developed autism shortly after receiving inoculations , either following a vaccine series for mumps , measles and rubella ( German measles ) -- the so - called MMR vaccine -- or following vaccines containing thimerosal , a preservative that contains mercury .
Much of the hype surrounding a link between vaccines and autism was fueled by a widely covered investigation of 12 children published in 1998 by British gastroenterologist Andrew Wakefield and his colleagues .
The study revealed that symptoms of autism emerged shortly after the children received the MMR vaccine .
( Ten of the 13 authors have since published a retraction of the article 's conclusions . )
Public interest in the vaccine - autism link was further stoked by the provocatively entitled book Evidence of Harm ( St. Martin 's Press , 2005 ) , written by investigative journalist David Kirby , which was featured in an extended segment on NBC's Meet the Press .
Yet recently published research has not been kind to this much ballyhooed link .
The results of several large American , European and Japanese studies demonstrate that although the rate of MMR vaccinations has remained constant or declined , the rate of autism diagnoses has soared .
In addition , after the Danish government stopped administering thimerosal - bearing vaccines , the rates of autism continued to rise .
These studies and others summarized by the Institute of Medicine suggest there is little evidence that vaccines cause autism .
It is possible that vaccines trigger autism in a small subset of children , but if so that subset has yet to be identified .
Changing Criteria
Making matters more confusing , ample reason exists to question the very existence of the autism epidemic .
Vaccines may be what scientists call an explanation in search of a phenomenon .
As University of WisconsinMadison psychologists Morton Ann Gernsbacher and H. Hill Goldsmith and University of Montreal researcher Michelle Dawson noted in a 2005 review , there is an often overlooked alternative explanation for the epidemic : changes in diagnostic practices .
Over time the criteria for a diagnosis of autism have loosened , resulting in the labeling of substantially more mildly afflicted individuals as autistic .
Indeed , the 1980 version of the American Psychiatric Association 's diagnostic manual ( DSM - III ) required individuals to meet six of six criteria for an autism diagnosis .
In contrast , the 1994 version ( DSM - IV ) , which is currently in use , requires individuals to meet any eight of 16 criteria .
Moreover , whereas DSM - III contained only two diagnoses relevant to autism , DSM - IV contains five such diagnoses , including Asperger 's syndrome , which most researchers regard as a high - functioning variant of autism .
Legal changes may also be playing a significant role .
As Gernsbacher and her colleagues have noted , an amended version of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ( IDEA ) , passed by Congress in 1991 , requires school districts to provide precise counts of children with disabilities .
IDEA has resulted in sharp surges in the reported numbers of children with autism .
Nevertheless , these numbers are not based on careful diagnoses of autism or on representative samples of the population .
As a consequence , researchers who rely on administrative - based estimates , which come from government data submitted by schools , will arrive at misleading conclusions about autism 's prevalence .
They must instead rely on population - based estimates , which are developed from statistically reliable and representative surveys of autism 's occurrence in the general population .
Further contributing to the reported increase may be the Rain Man effect , the public 's increased familiarity with autism following the 1988 Academy Awardwinning film starring Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise .
Swapped Diagnoses
Two recent studies buttress assertions that the autism epidemic may be more illusory than real .
First , in 2005 psychiatrist Suniti Chakrabarti of the Child Development Center in Stafford , England , and psychiatrist Eric Fombonne of McGill University conducted an investigation that used rigorous population - based estimates to track the prevalence of autism diagnoses from 1992 to 1998 in a sample of more than 10,000 children in the same area of England .
They found no support for a change in prevalence , suggesting that when researchers maintain the same criteria for autism , the rates of diagnosis do not change over time .
Second , a 2006 article by University of WisconsinMadison psychologist Paul Shattuck cited diagnostic substitution : as the rates of the autism diagnosis increased from 1994 to 2003 , the rates of diagnoses of mental retardation and learning disabilities decreased .
It is possible that the overall pool of children with autismlike features has remained constant but that the specific diagnoses within this pool have switched .
It is still too early to exclude the possibility that autism 's prevalence is growing , but it is unlikely that it is growing as swiftly as many have suggested .
As the late Eastern Michigan University sociologist Marcello Truzzi once said , extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof .
The claim of an enormous epidemic of autism diagnoses is indeed extraordinary .
Yet the evidence for this claim leaves much to be desired .
Has Earth Climate Warming Trend Stopped ?
Former BBC science journalist and astrophysicist Dr. David
Whitehouse says in spite of rising atmospheric CO2 the average temperate on planet Earth is not rising .
With only few days remaining in 2007 , the indications are the global temperature for this year is the same as that for 2006  there has been no warming over the 12 months .
But is this just a blip in the ever upward trend you may ask ?
No .
The fact is that the global temperature of 2007 is statistically the same as 2006 as well as every year since 2001 .
Global warming has , temporarily or permanently , ceased .
Temperatures across the world are not increasing as they should according to the fundamental theory behind global warming  the greenhouse effect .
Something else is happening and it is vital that we find out what or else we may spend hundreds of billions of pounds needlessly .
Whitehouse is not making a radical claim .
He 's just not putting the same spin on the facts that you 'll find in most media reports about temperature trends .
A recent BBC report ( not by Whitehouse ) has a chart showing 1998 was warmer than any year since and 6 years in that period were slightly warmer than 2007 .
Their spin is that the 2007 temperature shows that global warming is a confirmed trend .
Um , well , on one hand 2007 did n't return the world to cooler temperature levels from earlier decades .
But on the other hand the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has gone up a lot since 1998 .
So why has n't the average global temperature for 2007 easily beat the 1998 number ?
( not trying to imply an answer btw - I 'm just full of questions )
Dr. Whitehouse says the world might be cooling due to reduced solar energy output .
Something is happening to our Sun .
It has to do with sunspots , or rather the activity cycle their coming and going signifies .
After a period of exceptionally high activity in the 20th century , our Sun has suddenly gone exceptionally quiet .
Months have passed with no spots visible on its disc .
We are at the end of one cycle of activity and astronomers are waiting for the sunspots to return and mark the start of the next , the so - called cycle 24 .
They have been waiting for a while now with no sign it 's on its way any time soon .
So maybe atmospheric carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) buildup really has a warming effect .
But that warming effect is getting offset by a cooling effect caused by less solar radiation .
But recently the Sun 's internal circulation has been failing .
In May 2006 this conveyor belt had slowed to a crawl  a record low .
Nasa scientist David Hathaway said : " It 's off the bottom of the charts ... this has important repercussions for future solar activity . "
What 's more , it 's not the only indicator that the Sun is up to something .
Back during the Little Ice Age era ( starting perhaps as early as the 13th century and ending in the 19th century ) the Earth experienced periods of reduced sunspot activity including during the Sporer Minimum ( 1450 1540 ) and Maunder Minimum ( 1645-1715 ) .
That period featured a Thames River that froze over in winters and lots of hunger and death from food shortages in Europe .
Another Little Ice
Age would cause problems on a scale rivaling or exceeding some of the problems predicted from global warming .
Reduced sunspot activity is n't necessarily a reason for complaisance about atmospheric CO2 buildup .
Even if our pollution is buffering the effects of reduced solar output at some point the sun will probably kick back up again and the CO2 will still be there .
Though if the Sun causes huge climate changes ( and that appears to be the case ) then we need to develop the means to rapidly dial up and down the greenhouse effect in order to reduce the size of climate swings caused by solar output fluctuations .
Another possibility : Maybe increased sulfur aerosol pollution from China burning more coal is generating a cooling effect that is partially canceling the warming effect of CO2 buildup .
This seems plausible at least .
China 's rate of expansion has caused a huge increase in a wide range of emissions and not just CO2 emissions .
Along with aluminum and cement , steel is the biggest reason China added 90 gigawatts of power generation capacity this year , the third year in a row in which it will increase its power output by more than the total capacity of Britain .
About 85 percent of those new power plants burn coal .
The International Energy Agency , an energy policy and research group in Paris , had predicted as recently as a few years ago that China 's carbon emissions would not reach those of the United States until 2020 .
But industrial production and coal use have grown so much faster than estimated that the agency now thinks China took the lead this year .
Production which has been shifted from the West to China ( many economists call this " free trade " ) is cheaper in China in part because China tolerates far more pollution per unit of production .
A study by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University found that if all the goods that the United States imported between 1997 and 2004 had been produced domestically , America 's carbon emissions would have been 30 percent higher .
A separate study for the European Parliament examined the transfer of steel production to China from Germany .
It found that China 's less efficient steel mills , and its greater reliance on coal , meant that it emitted three times as much carbon dioxide per ton of steel as German steel producers .
Pollution has not only shifted to China , in other words , but intensified even faster than the country 's rapidly expanding output .
So types of pollutants that reflect away the sun 's energy are another possible explanation for the seeming end of the warming trend in Earth average temperature .
Aside : Britain is also in the ranks of countries that have basically exported a lot of their pollution to China .
Update :
What I want to know :
How noisy is the data for measuring the average temperature of the Earth 's atmosphere ?
Could noise in the data make a real warming trend seem to stop ?
Given that temperature over a period of centuries varies a great deal naturally one should expect natural trends to sometimes work with and work against human - caused trends and therefore make human - caused trends harder to detect and confirm .
There are real limits on our ability to know what is going on .
Update II : See the comments section for a comment about how volcanic eruptions make the temperature data noisy .
Also , Peak Coal might end the whole fossil fuels emissions debate in a couple of decades .
Peak Oil and Peak Natural Gas will probably happen sooner .
For more on Peak Coal see here and here and here and here .
Rep. Wexler Update on Impeachment Movement
by Wexler For Congress Campaign
Dear Friends ,
This evening , I am taking the floor of the House of Representatives to strongly reassert my call for hearings on the Articles of Impeachment of Vice President Cheney previously introduced by Dennis Kucinich .
Please watch it on CSPAN – I should be taking the floor tonight after the last vote , between 7 - 9 PM Eastern .
Wexler For Congress Campaign ’s diary :: ::
Tomorrow , I will deliver a letter to my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee , encouraging them to sign on to a letter in support of Cheney impeachment hearings to Chairman Conyers .
This is a critical point in the impeachment movement .
Congress is very much aware of what we ’re doing “ “ thanks in part to your letters and calls “ “ but there is much work to be done .
We must enforce the outstanding subpoenas and begin to question key witnesses .
Impeachment will break through Executive Privilege and allow us to cut through the diversions and obstruction that has occurred these last months .
Over the next days , please take a moment to let your representative know your feelings about Impeachment and ask them to support our efforts .
Please also call the media outlets and urge them to cover this movement .
In case you miss me tonight , tomorrow we will update you with a link to the video and more information on what has occurred .
Please do n’t forget to join the cause at www.WexlerWantsHearings.com.
Again “ “ I thank you for your support in this important endeavor .
Congressman Robert Wexler
( Original Article )
For a quarter - century or more , the prevailing view among geoscientists — supported by paleomagnetic records in rock — has been that the portion of the ancient supercontinent of Pangea that is now the Colorado Plateau in southern
Utah shifted more than 1,300 miles north during a 100 - million - year span that ended about 200 million years ago in the early Jurassic Period , when Pangea began to break up .
But new research by a team of geoscientists from the University of Michigan and the University of Nebraska - Lincoln challenges that theory , based on extensive climate modeling studies and sedimentary records found from Wyoming into Utah and Arizona .
In a paper published in the Nov. 23 issue of the journal Science , U - M geophysicist Rob Van der Voo and co-authors report findings that indicate the area must have remained at the equator during the time in question .
" It 's a puzzle , a ' conundrum ' is the word we like to use , " said Robert Oglesby of UNL .
" And in the Science paper , we 're not solving the conundrum , we 're raising the conundrum . "
The puzzle revolves around ongoing research by UNL researcher David Loope in the Colorado Plateau .
A sedimentologist and an expert on dune formation , Loope found that from central Wyoming into central Utah , ancient dunes preserved in the region 's sandstone formations from 300 million to 200 million years ago all faced southwest , meaning that the winds over that extensive area were almost constantly from the northeast .
As his study progressed , he discovered that the direction of the dunes shifted to the southeast in what is now southern Utah , meaning the wind direction shifted to the northwest .
What 's more , those prevailing winds were consistent over the entire 100 million years in question and the shift in wind direction could only have occurred at the equator .
" I thought that was very curious , " Loope said .
" It did n't seem to fit with what we think we know about where the continents were . "
Loope is also a paleoclimatologist ( someone who studies ancient climates ) , as are his UNL co-authors Oglesby and Clinton Rowe .
The three geoscientists began working together , trying to find a computerized climate model that would explain the discrepancy , but they could n't find one that worked .
" We ran the model in any different number of configurations just to see if we could make it do something different , " Rowe said .
" It did n't matter what we did to it , as long as you had some land , and it was distributed north and south of the equator , you would end up with this monsoonal flow that matched these records from the dunes .
The equator is the only place you could get this large - scale arc of winds that turn from the northeast to the northwest as they moved south .
Nowhere else would you get that as part of the general circulation unless the physics of the world 200 million years ago was very different from what it is today .
And we just do n't think that 's the case . "
Puzzled by the discrepancy between their research and the paleomagnetic records , they turned to Van der Voo , an expert on paleomagnetism .
Paleomagnetic records are found in igneous rocks that permanently record the direction of the Earth 's magnetic field at the time they solidify from the molten state .
They 're an important tool for geoscientists in tracking the movement of Earth 's tectonic plates over time , and records in North America indicate that the Colorado Plateau moved from the equator to about 20 degrees north latitude from 300 million years ago to 200 million years ago .
" We brought Rob in to try to see if he could help us sort it out , and he 's like , ' Gosh , guys , I do n't know .
This is a conundrum , ' " Oglesby said .
" It 's important to note that we have not just a paleomag person as a co-author , but arguably the best - known paleomag person in the world — and he's as confused as we are . "
" The nicest thing would have been if we had a solution , but we don't , " said Van der Voo , the Frank H. T. Rhodes Professor of Geological Sciences at U - M .
" All we can say is that we have this enigma , so perhaps our model of Pangea for the period in question is wrong or the wind direction did n't follow the common patterns that we recognize in the modern world .
Neither seems likely , but we 're bringing this inconsistency to the attention of the scientific community in hopes of stimulating further research . "
Van der Voo 's co-authors agree there 's only one thing to do : keep attacking the problem .
" We 'll come up with everything we can possibly think of , " Oglesby said .
" From the point of view of the climate model , the paleogeography , the vegetation , the topography , local - scale vs. large - scale , paleomag , going back and rethinking everything that the dunes tell us .
We 'll go back to square one in everything , trying to figure it out . "
In addition to Van der Voo , Loope , Oglesby and Rowe , former UNL graduate student Charles Broadwater was a co-author on the paper .

The village children love reading the books that the mules bring
Enlarge Image
Chiquito and Cenizo greet me with a bit of a snort and a flick of the tail .
Mules are too tough to bother being sweet .
They do a hard job which no other animal or human invention can do as well .
But these mules are rather special .
They are known as bibliomulas ( book mules ) and they are helping to spread the benefits of reading to people who are isolated from much of the world around them .
My trek started from the Valley of Momboy in Trujillo , one of Venezuela 's three Andean states .
These are the foothills of the Andes but they are high enough , especially when you are walking .
Slow but steady
The idea of loading mules with books and taking them into the mountain villages was started by the University of Momboy , a small institution that prides itself on its community - based initiatives and on doing far more than universities in Venezuela are required to do by law .
Spreading the joy of reading is our main aim
Christina Vieras , project leader
Accompanying us was local guide Ruan who knows a thing or two about mules .
He was their boss , cajoling them carefully as they started up the hill at a slow - but - steady , no - nonsense plod .
The deeply rutted , dry and dusty path snaked its way up .
The sun beat on the back of my neck .
We were all breathless , apart from Ruan .
Diving for books
A break came when it was my turn to ride a mule .
I enjoyed a great view of the valley but held on tight as Chiquito veered close to the edge .
Hot and slightly bothered after two hours , we reached Calembe , the first village on this path .
Anyone who was not out working the fields - tending the celery that is the main crop here - was waiting for our arrival .
The 23 children at the little school were very excited .
" Bibilomu - u - u - u - las , " they shouted as the bags of books were unstrapped .
They dived in eagerly , keen to grab the best titles and within minutes were being read to by Christina and Juana , two of the project leaders .
" Spreading the joy of reading is our main aim , " Christina Vieras told me .
" But it 's more than that .
We 're helping educate people about other important things like the environment .
All the children are planting trees .
Anything to improve the quality of life and connect these communities . "
Internet plans
As the project grows , it is using the latest technology .
I love reading books and we get told some really nice stories
Jose Castillo
12 years old
Somehow there is already a limited mobile phone signal here , so the organisers are taking advantage of that and equipping the mules with laptops and projectors .
The book mules are becoming cyber mules and cine mules .
" We want to install wireless modems under the banana plants so the villagers can use the internet , " says Robert Ramirez , the co-ordinator of the university 's Network of Enterprising Rural Schools .
" Imagine if people in the poor towns in the valley can e-mail saying how many tomatoes they 'll need next week , or how much celery .
" The farmers can reply telling them how much they can produce .
It 's blending localisation and globalisation . "
Local enthusiasm
The book mule team played noisy games with the children , listened to them read and lunched with the adults , discussing over a hearty soup and corn bread how the community can develop the scheme .
This four - legged mobile library is not just keeping this place alive but making it thrive
One idea was using the mules to transport medicines which can be so hard to get hold of here .
Everyone I spoke to - both adults and children - was full of enthusiasm .
" It 's great , " said 12 - year - old Jose Castillo .
" I love reading books and we get told some really nice stories . "
Looking up from reading her book about Harry the cat and his trip to the vet , Gesenae Guerdo told me she loved reading too .
" We share a lot of these books , " she said .
Javier Sulveran , a young , bright man in his twenties , tells me that the village is very supportive of the project :
" The children are really motivated to read and we are too .
A lot of the adults are reading more .
It 's great that they come up here . "
The university has acquired a new mule .
They are going to keep it in Calembe under the care of the locals , something Javier really approved of .
The mule will be able to get further into the mountains and spread the word to more villages that so far remain too remote .
With fond farewells we left Calembe behind .
It was clear I was leaving a place with a strong sense of community .
This four - legged mobile library is not just keeping this place alive but making it thrive .

I got accused of " hubris " for writing that Ron Paul is Hillary ’s worst nightmare .
I ’m not sure that my confidence in the candidacy of another can be considered hubris but I wo n’t quibble over that .
[ Full disclosure .
I only met Ron Paul once and am not involved in his campaign in any way .
I only know what I read on the web . ]
Here ’s my point .
I warned those leaning to Bush over Kerry in 2004 that a Bush win could put Hillary in the White House for two terms .
I ’m sure many laughed at that line also .
Now , Hillary has to be considered the clear favorite to win the Presidency .
She leads the Democratic candidates in the polls and number two is Barack Obama whose entire rsum says : " very good public speaker . "
That ’s a very good place to be .
( By the way , I ’m sure many also laughed when I predicted on December 3 , 2003 , that John Kerry would be the Democratic nominee . )
Many people cannot believe that Hillary has a chance because everyone they know dislikes her .
But that ’s because birds of a feather flock together .
Your friends are not a scientific survey .
Now look over at the Republican side and start laughing .
Rudy Giuliani and Newt Gingrich ?
Call Dr. Laura ; you need her badly .
McCain ’s in there too .
Ron Paul versus three establishment centrists who supported the war sounds like a good scenario in the Republican primaries .
Pre-Ron Paul , John McCain was the presumptive nominee in my view .
For many reasons I believed Hillary would beat him .
Reason number one is his ferocious support of the failed war in Iraq .
If it ’s Hillary versus McCain , Hillary has the good fortune of being the antiwar choice even though she supported the war .
All that being the case , why in the world would she want to upset the applecart and face an unknown commodity like Ron Paul ?
She has nothing to gain and everything to lose .
The expression " beware of the amateur " comes to mind .
Not that Ron Paul is an amateur but the principle applies just the same .
Hillary knows exactly what McCain will do and say , but she has no playbook on Ron Paul .
Nobody does .
It ’s an entirely unpredictable race .
She ’d take McCain any day over the Great Unknown .
Now , consider the fact that on the key issue of the campaign , the Iraq War , Ron Paul beats Hillary .
He voted against the war and she for it .
On three other key issues , the economy , immigration and health care , Ron Paul ’s views should fare quite well against Hillary’s .
So , when I say people should take Ron Paul seriously , I ’m not just whistling Dixie .
Which brings to mind another reason to take him seriously : Southerners tend to win the White House .
A Ron Paul candidacy in the Republican primaries is a historic opportunity .
The last Jeffersonian president was Buffalo ’s own Grover Cleveland who left office in 1897 .
This campaign is an opportunity to take care of a lot of " old business " that has accumulated since that time .
History shows that major political change happens like an earthquake .
Energy builds up slowly over time , hemmed in by the enormous power of the status quo .
Then , just one more calorie of energy can cause an enormous earthquake .
And just like real earthquakes , political earthquakes are impossible to predict in advance .
They only seemed inevitable after the fact .
All I ’m saying is that the Ron Paul campaign could be a political earthquake .
We wo n’t and ca n’t know until after the fact .
So far , the establishment press has largely ignored or dismissed his candidacy .
That ’s good !
That means that if he becomes a serious candidate , it will be a victory for the blogosphere against the establishment press .
In the meantime , enjoy the ride .
How often do you have a chance to strike the same blow against the political establishment and its partner in crime , the establishment press ?

JERUSALEM , Nov 29 ( Reuters ) - Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said in a newspaper interview published on Thursday that failure to negotiate a two - state solution with the Palestinians could threaten Israel 's long - term survival .
" If the day comes when the two - state solution collapses , and we face a South African - style struggle for equal voting rights ( with Palestinians ) ... then , as soon as that happens , the State of Israel is finished , " Olmert told the Haaretz daily .
The interview was published the day after Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas met U.S. President George W. Bush in Washington to resume the first formal peace talks in seven years .
That followed Tuesday 's peace conference in Annapolis , Maryland which ended with a pledge to try to forge a peace treaty between Israel and the Palestinians by the end of 2008 .
Israel is worried Palestinians could eventually outnumber Jews if it keeps control of all the territory it captured in the 1967 Middle East war .
Olmert said that if Israel failed to agree to a two - state solution and tried to absorb Palestinians into a Jewish state without giving them equal voting rights , influential U.S. Jewish organisations " will be the first to come out against us " .
" They will say they cannot support a state that does not support democracy and equal voting rights for all its residents , " he said .
Olmert said that four years ago , when deputy to former Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon , he had already stated Israel should withdraw from most of the land captured in 1967 .
" ( People ) will say I 'm having problems and that 's why I 'm trying to do ( a peace process ) , but the facts must be dealt with justly , " Olmert said .
Olmert is due to return to Israel at around midday on Thursday and is expected to hear whether police will recommend indicting him on corruption charges on the sale of one of Israel 's biggest banks when he served as finance minister .
NOT HISTORIC
Olmert told Haaretz that " Annapolis is not a historic turning point , but it is a point that can be of assistance . "
He added that negotiations with the Palestinians would be " difficult , complex , and will require a very great deal of patience and sophistication . "
Olmert said he would have to do all he could to help Abbas deliver his part of a peace deal .
" It is my job to do everything so that he receives the tools , and to reach an understanding on the guidelines for an agreement , " Olmert said .
He said that he and Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni would continue to lead Israel 's negotiating team but that " there will also be people acting on my behalf , who will have a very significant role in this process . "
Two polls appearing in Israeli newspapers on Thursday showed that up to half of respondents thought the Annapolis conference was a failure .
The mass circulation Yedioth Ahronoth showed that 50 percent of respondents -- the largest single bloc -- said Annapolis was a failure , with only 18 percent saying it was a success .
A Haaretz poll said 42 percent of respondents thought Annapolis was a failure .

I have friends who are Jews , Christian and Buddhist and would have acted in the same way if they were victims of an unprovoked attack
Hassan Askari
Hassan Askari has been described as a " latter - day Good Samaritan " for coming to the aid of the three , who were attacked earlier this month .
A gang yelling anti-Semitic slogans had assaulted them on the city 's subway .
His intervention left him with a possible broken nose , a stitched lip , bruises and two black eyes .
' One family '
But it was sufficient for the attackers to turn their attention on him and allow one of those who was being attacked to raise the alarm and call the police .
" I was brought up to believe that you cannot walk away from an incident like this , " he told the BBC .
Mr Askari ( second from left ) has been honoured across New York
" I felt I could not just stand there and watch these people being beaten up without doing anything to help .
" I believe we are all members of one family , and my religion teaches me always to come to the aid of my fellow man in distress . "
The slightly - built accountancy student - who comes from an aristocratic Bengali family - was travelling from home on 9 December when he saw the attack take place on a crowded train .
Mr Askari has three forefathers who were knighted by British monarchs during the days of the Raj and is a member of the Dhaka Nawab family , an important political dynasty in the Indian subcontinent .
Around 10 people were attacking the three Jews after an argument had broken out .
" As the quarrel turned progressively more violent , scores of people on the train ignored the fight and did n't want to have anything to do with it , " said Marc Scheier , a rabbi from the Foundation for Ethnic Understanding , who presented Mr Askari with a bravery award earlier this month .
Mr Askari's family were knighted by British monarchs
" Mr Askari - like the Good Samaritan - was the only person brave enough to intervene .
" The symbolism of his action at Christmas time is striking - a foreign Muslim coming to the aid of three Jews in an act of kindness and cooperation .
" People often forget that Judaism and Islam are n't so far apart as the radicals from both sides would have us believe .
We are both Abrahamic religions and in many respects share a common faith . "
' Unprovoked attack '
Mr Askari said that he was " overwhelmed " by the publicity his actions have generated , and " embarrassed " that the American press have labelled him a " hero of the city " .
" I have friends who are Jews , Christians and Buddhists and would have acted in the same way if they were victims of an unprovoked attack , " he said .
The student has been hailed a hero by the New York press
Rabbi Scheier said that he could tell from injuries sustained by one of the three victims that it was a " brutal and extremely violent " attack which would have required " immense courage " from Mr Askari to get involved in .
" He is such a humble and modest man blessed with the most extraordinary bravery , " he said .
Ten people have been arrested in connection with the attack and three of them have appeared in court charged with assault and disorderly conduct .
Mr Askari is due to be presented with a medal on Wednesday that will be handed to him either by or on behalf of the Mayor of New York , Michael Bloomberg .
The student - whose mother , father and younger brother live in the Bangladeshi capital , Dhaka - says that his long term aim is to return to his beloved home country where he grew up as a child .
" Home is where the heart is and at least there is no subway there , " he said .
WENATCHEE — A 29 - year - old Wenatchee man told police a pterodactyl caused him to drive his car into a light pole about 11:30 p.m. Thursday .
Wenatchee police cited the man with first - degree negligent driving .
A breathalyzer test showed “ a minimal amount of alcohol , ” said Wenatchee police Sgt. Cherie Smith .
Witnesses told police the man was northbound on Wenatchee Avenue and drifted into a southbound lane for less than a block .
Oncoming traffic stopped and waited for the man to pass , Smith said .
He then totaled his car on a light pole , Smith said .
When police asked the man what caused the accident , his one - word answer was “ pterodactyl , ” Smith said .
A pterodactyl was a giant winged reptile that lived more than 65 million years ago .
The man was treated and released at Central Washington Hospital , hospital officials said .

LG Voyager Rated 4.5 out of 5 by Wireless and Mobile News
The LG Voyager has been called the ‘ perhaps iPhone killer , ” and takes the best features of other LG phones for a huge “ wow ” factor .
It has the touchscreen operations of the iPhone with the added value of a huge QWERTY keyboard ( considered a deal breaker for texting ) and a second screen .
The LG Voyager offers great video quality and a TV antenna .
Practical & Haptical Input
A reviewer likened the LG Voyager to the Prada phone because of its haptical touch sensations when functions are operated by the touchscreen .
The keyboard is bigger than the enV and is easy to use .
The best features of the LG Voyager include : GPS , a replaceable battery , V CAST live TV , video recording , adjustable preview capable camera functions , Bluetooh for dial - up networking / printing / stereo headphones , voice dialing , and a comfort grip .
It unfortunately does not have Wi-Fi capabilities .
The LG Voyager sells for $ 299 with a two year contract .
There has been much debate whether the iPhone or the Verizon is a better phone .
We will be writing a Review of Reviews of iPhone vs. LG Voyager shortly .
Sacha Cohen at PCMag
rated the LG Voyager 4 out of 5 , although he liked many of the features
such as haptical touch , keyboard typing , Bluetooth and crisp sounding
music .
He did n’t like the inability to sync contacts or music
playlists , the camera quality and found the phone reception adequate .
He ends the review with “ if you chose your network first and it ’s Verizon , this is the closest you ’ll get to a true mobile revolution for now . ”
Kent German at CNET rated the LG Voyager 8.3 out of 10 .
CNET gave it CNET Editors Choice .
He liked the cutting - edge design , keyboard and dynamic touchscreen .
Other good factors were fast EV - DO , web browsing , bluetooth , GPS and great call quality .
He disliked the quality of the photos , lack of Wi-Fi , clunkiness of touchscreen and jumping of the video .
He calls the LG Voyager ” the best LG messaging and multimedia phone by far . ”
In the video he calls it “ a really high - powered phone with a great design . ”
Mike Wendland of NBC - TV admired the touch screen , and noted that the phone does a lot of things iPhone does n’t such as the neat touch icons have vibration ( haptical ) touch , you can download music anywhere over the air , it works with the fast 3G EV - D0 network which will be a big part of its success .
It has video and GPS turn by turn directions making it “ really cool . ”
Wait there ’s more — - a full QWERTY keyboard !
He says it may be “ perhaps , the iPhone killer . ”
On November 15 , we received a review unit of the LG Voyager .
We took
it over to be tested at our special - technophile coffee house and wrote
up the results at New Review Verizon LG Voyager Coffee House Test Review .

If the endless amount of platform combinations between Rock Band and Guitar Hero III have you stymied already , here 's a little tidbit to make it just a little bit harder to choose : Guitar Hero III wireless controller are going to be available early next year for all platforms .
Rock Band has wireless controllers on the way in a similar time frame for both the 360 and PS3 , but for some reason the 360 version costs an extra $ 20 , so hopefully Guitar Hero guitars keep some better price parity .
The image shows 1 out of the 9 large galaxies included in the Chandra study , containing a supermassive black hole in its center .
Supermassiveblack holes spin at speeds approaching the speed of light , new researchsuggests .
Nine hugegalaxies were found to contain furiously whirling black holes that pump outenergetic jets of gas into the surrounding environment , according to a studyusing data from NASA 's Chandra X-ray Observatory .
" Wethink these monster black holes are spinning close to the limit set byEinstein ? s theory of relativity , which means that they can drag material aroundthem at close to the speed of light , " said Rodrigo Nemmen , the study 's leadauthor and a visiting graduate student at Penn State University .
Einstein 'stheory suggests spinningblack holes would make space itself rotate .
The overall effect makes gasspiral in toward the black hole , and also creates a magnetic field that shootsinflowing gas back out as a jet .
Researcherspreviously found that the greater the amount of gas falling into supermassiveblack holes — known as the accretion rate — the greater the energy of the jetsshooting out .
Leading theories suggest that the same jets drive the rotation ofthe central black holes in galaxies .
" Bycomparing observations of massive elliptical galaxies with current theories ofjet formation , we are able to get the spin of supermassive black holes , " Nemmen told SPACE.com , explaining how his group ran computer simulationsand compared the results with Chandra 's observations of the nine objects .
Black holesca n't be seen , but their existence and mass are inferred by their gravitationaleffects on material around them and by the energy released from all theactivity .
Theobserved jet power and accretion rates were huge — one black hole ate 10 Earthmasses per month and , from its surroundings , spat out 50 times the annualenergy of our sun per second .
That allowed Nemmen and his colleagues toestimate that the spin of the black holes approaches Einstein 's speed - of - lightlimit .
" Extremelyfast spin might be very common for large black holes , " saidco - investigator Richard Bower of Durham University .
" This might help usexplain the source of these incredible jets that we see stretching for enormousdistances across space . "
The jetsproduced by such high - speed spins heat the surrounding gaseous atmosphere andcan help trigger the birth of stars .
However , such powerful jets could also destroythe atmospheres of neighboring planets .
The newresearch was detailed in a paper presented at a meeting of the AmericanAstronomical Society in Austin , Texas , last week .
Duke University Medical Center neuroscientists say the places a memory is processed in the brain may determine how someone can be absolutely certain of a past event that never occurred .
These findings could help physicians better appreciate the memory changes that accompany normal aging or even lead to tools for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer 's disease , according to Duke neuroscientist Roberto Cabeza , Ph.D .
Information retrieved from memory is simultaneously processed in two specific regions of the brain , each of which focuses on a different aspect of an past event .
The medial temporal lobe ( MTL ) , located at the base of the brain , focuses on specific facts about the event .
The frontal parietal network ( FPN ) , located at the top of the brain , is more likely to process the global gist of the event .
The specific brain area accessed when one tries to remember something can ultimately determine whether or not we think the memory is true or false , the researchers found .
" Human memory is not like computer memory -- it is n't completely right all the time , " said Cabeza , senior author of a paper appearing in the Journal of Neuroscience .
" There are many occasions when people feel strongly about past events , even though they might not have occurred . "
Cabeza wanted to understand why someone could have such strong feelings of confidence about false memories .
In his experiments , he scanned the brains of healthy volunteers with functional MRI as they took well - established tests of memory and false memory .
Functional MRI is an imaging technique that shows what areas of the brain are used during specific mental tasks .
During the brain scans , Cabeza found that volunteers who were highly confident in memories that were indeed true showed increased activity in the fact - oriented MTL region .
" This would make sense , because the MTL , with its wealth of specific details , would make the memory seem more vivid , " Cabeza said .
" For example , thinking about your breakfast this morning , you remember what you had , the taste of the food , the people you were with .
The added richness of these details makes one more confident about the memory 's truth . "
On the other hand , volunteers who showed high confidence in memories that turned out to be false exhibited increased activity in the impressionistic FPN .
The people drawing from this area of the brain recalled the gist or general idea of the event , and while they felt confident about their memories , they were often mistaken , since they could not recall the details of the memory .
These findings , coupled with the findings of other studies , can help explain what happens to the human brain as it ages , Cabeza said .
" Specific memories do n't last forever , but what ends up lasting are not specific details , but more general or global impressions , " Cabeza said .
" Past studies have shown that as normal brains age , they tend to lose the ability to recollect specifics faster than they lose the ability recall impressions .
However , patients with Alzheimer 's disease tend to lose both types of memories equally , which may prove to be a tool for early diagnosis . "
Cabeza 's colleague for this research was Hongkeun Kim at Daegu University in South Korea .
The research was supported by the National Institutes of Health and Daegu University .

どんなにステーキが大好きな人でも、
毎日、朝昼晩、ステーキだけを強制的に食べさせられ続けたら、
だんだん苦痛になってくる。
本当にステーキが好きな人なら、最初の１ヶ月くらいは毎食ステーキだけでも天国かも知れないが、
それが半年もつづけば、もはやステーキを見るだけでウンザリするだろう。
プログラミングが好きでプログラマーになってしまった人は、
これと同じ種類の拷問にかけられる。
どんなにプログラミングが好きな人でも、毎日休まずプログラムを書き続けないと
生活できないとなると、それはだんだん苦痛になってくる。
好きなことを仕事にして生きていく、というのは、本質的にそういうことなのだ。
そもそも、人は、その瞬間、瞬間で、いろんなことに興味をもち、
いろんなことをやりたくなる、自由で軽やかに発散していく欲望を持っている。
どんなにプログラミングが好きな人でも、
朝起きて、今日は空が青くて気持ちいいな、と思ったら、そのまま電車に乗って、
海を見に行きたくなったりする。
電車でかわいい女の子を見かけたら、
プログラミングなんかするより、その子を眺めていたい。
美味しそうなチョコレートパフェの店頭ディスプレイを見かけたら、
午後のプログラミングは中止にして、喫茶店に飛び込んで、
チョコパフェを食べてまったりしたくなる。
しかし、職業プログラマーは、常に納期に追われている。
だから、自分の中からわき上がってくるこれらの純粋で自然な気持ちを殺して、
しぶしぶプログラミングをする。
どんなに気分が乗らなくても、どんなに苦痛でも、プログラミングするしかない。
どんなに疲れていても、体調が悪くても、納期が迫っていれば、無理してプログラミングするしかない。
好きなことを仕事にしたとたん、「好き」はあなたを縛り付け、苦痛を与え続ける拷問台になる。
これに気がついたとき、ぼくはプログラマーを辞めた。
「 好きを仕事に」という牢獄から脱獄し、
「 ショーシャンクの空に」みたいに両手を広げて空を仰ぎ、生きている喜びを味わうことにした。
夕日に染まる美しい落ち葉の林を歩くとき、
ぼくは、自分が何者でもないことに感謝する。
もしボクが写真家だったら、ぼくはこの美しい光景を、
どうしたらきれいな写真に収めることができるか考えるだろう。
もしボクがミュージシャンだったら、この美しい光景を
曲にすることを考えるだろう。
もしボクがビジネスマンだったら、この美しい光景で、
金儲けをすることを考えるだろう。
もしボクが哲学者だったら、この美しい光景を見て、
哲学的な思索をはじめるだろう。
しかし、ぼくは何者でもない。
だから、この美しい光景を、
単にその美しい光景、それ自体として、そのまま素直に受け入れ、味わい、楽しむことができる。
ぼくはできるだけ、そのときどきの自分の中にわき起こってくる自然な気持ちに従って生きることにしている。
企画をやりたいときには企画を、法律に興味をもったら法律を、
デザインをやりたいときにはデザインを、会社を作りたくなったら会社を、
女の子と遊びたくなったら女の子と 、
金儲けゲームをしたくなったら金儲けを、ブログを書きたくなったらブログを、
絵を描きたくなったら絵を描くことにしている。
だから、ぼくには趣味と言えるものがない。
好きを貫いてもいない。
ぼくは 「好きという呪い」から自由であろうとする。
「 好きを仕事に」というキャッチフレーズは、
社会を維持し、食っていくためにいやいや仕事をやっているという現実から
目を背けるための、モルヒネでしかない。
毎日朝昼晩、ステーキばかり強制的に
食わされる生活が幸福であるはずがないのだが、
「 ぼくはステーキが好きだから 、
毎日ステーキを食べられるボクは幸せなはずなんだ」
と無理矢理自分を洗脳し、誤魔化しているだけだ。
そして、社会も 「 好きを仕事にしている人たちは輝いている！」という
インチキ宗教を絶賛キャンペーン中である。
なんで、人々はこのようなインチキ宗教を信じてしまうかというと、
単にその方が経済効率がいいように思えるからだ。
なんで社会がそれを推奨するかというと、
それによって、人々を社会の歯車(≒奴隷)として社会システムに組み込むのに
都合がいいからだ 。
ビジネス戦略の基本は、 「 選択と集中」である。
ぼくのように、そのときの気分で、デザインをやったり、企画をしたり、
ビジネスモデルを組み立てたり、法律を調べたり、設計をしたり、プログラミングを
したりしていると、どの分野のスキルも中途半端になってしまい、
売り物になるほど専門性のあるスキルが確立できない。
これが原因で、人々は、しかたなくどれか一つの専門を選び、
そこに 「選択と集中」をすることで、自分の専門性を確立し、
それをウリにして生計を立てるのである。
たとえば、法律ばかりを徹底して極め、法律家になったり、
企業の法務部門のスタッフとして職を得ることができる。
この選択と集中を行うのと行わないのとでは、
生涯で得られる報酬が大きく異なる。
報酬には、直接金銭で支払われるものと、非金銭的なものがあるが、
その両方とも、選択と集中を行った方がはるかに多くなる。
自分の専門性を確立した方が、よりよい職位を得られる。
そうするとまず、当然、より多くの年収が得られる(金銭的報酬 ) 。
また、職位が高いのでステータスが高く、より多くの人に敬意を払われるので気分がよい(非金銭的報酬 ) 。
さらに、よりやりがいのある面白い仕事が優先的に回ってくる(非金銭的報酬 ) 。
異性にもモテるだろう( 非金銭的報酬 ) 。
これは、なにも大企業に雇われているサラリーマンだけではない。
フリーランスでもベンチャーでも、本質的な構造はなんら違いはない。
このよう に 「選択と集中」は、とても甘い果実だ。
それは、人生に多大な豊かさをもたらしてくれる。
しかし、その甘い果実には、ジワジワと人生を蝕み、腐敗させる、イヤらしい毒が含まれている。
その毒に犯され腐敗していくさまざまな希望と可能性を、ポリバケツに放り込み、
臭いが漏れないように塞ぐためのフタが、「好きを仕事にする」という免罪符なのだ。
もちろん、だからと言って、全く選択と集中をしないでそのときの気分だけで生きていたら、
毒にもあたらないけど得られる報酬が少なくなりすぎる。
だから、この果実を食べること自体は必要悪だ。
なので、あとは、いかにこの果実の毒抜きをして上手に料理して食べるかがカギとなる。
たとえば、プログラミングに興味をもったら、最初の数年は、
そればかりやっていても、意外に楽しめる。
この状態では、果実の甘みと栄養が身体にどんどん吸収されているが、
まだ毒はあまり出ていない。
しかし、何年かたつと、毒がまわりはじめる。
そして、そのタイミングが、決断の時だ。
もしここで、プログラミングへの選択と集中をやめて、
そのとき興味をもった別の分野の仕事に移ろうとすると、
収入は大幅にダウンする。
なぜなら、いまの自分の給料は自分の専門性に対して支払われている
ものであって、その専門性を捨ててしまったら、自分は何者でもなくなって
しまうからだ 。
さらに言うと、選択と集中によって専門性を確立し、年収600万円になっている
ころには、人は既にある程度の年齢になってしまっており、
そこから他の職種に職種変えしようにも、そもそもそんな高年齢の新人など、
どの分野でもろくな待遇で受け入れてくれないのである。
なので、多くの人は、給料や待遇のダウンがイヤで、
いまの専門分野以外の職種につけないまま、一生を過ごすことになる。
これにより、それ以降の人生を、
自分の中にわき起こってくる、みずみずしく透明にきらめく、
多様な好奇心と欲求を、血まみれになりながらナイフでえぐり取り、
素知らぬ顔でゴミ箱に捨て、腐らせながら歳をとり、
灰色の時間で一生を塗りつぶすことになる。
これが、 「好きを貫いて生きる」ということの身も蓋もない現実だ。
しかし、そもそも、自分の専門性の蓄積によって得られている現在の高収入・好待遇を
前提として生活設計していること自体が、大きな勘違いなのではないだろうか？
選択と集中の果実の甘みであるその高収入・好待遇を
その毒にやられることなく味わえるのは、
最初の数年であることを自覚して生きているべきなのだ。
選択と集中によって現在年収600万円になっている人間は、
選択と集中という牢獄で一生を終えるという
奴隷契約書にサインをしないかぎり、
その年収は維持できない。
だから、選択と集中という牢獄につながれて一生を終えたくなければ、
現在の年収や待遇が、あくまで、ごく一時的な、仮のものとして生きていかなければならない。
高い待遇を仮のものとすれば、いつでもそれを捨てられる。
また、高い待遇を目指すために、ガマンして勉強したり仕事したりすることに
時間をとられることも無くなる。*1
そうすることによって、その時々の気分で、少しずつ自分の専門分野以外に、
ふらふらと足場をずらしながら、気分良く生きていくことが出来る。
たとえばボクの場合、最初は大学で心理学をやっていたけど、心理学データを処理する
プログラミング自体に興味を持ち、あっさり心理学を捨ててプログラマになってしまって、
今度は研究所で人工知能システムを作り、その後、業務ソフトから、エンタメソフトまで、
いろんなプログラムを開発した。そのうちプログラミングに飽きてきたら、
最初はITの新技術をレポートする雑誌記事を書きはじめ、
そのつてで、技術書の監訳の仕事が来て、さらに英語に興味をもち、翻訳をするようになり、
今度は自分の本を書き、また、知り合いも増えて、一緒に起業することになり、
あるいは、全然別分野で、巨大プラットフォームのAPI策定をするようになり、
国際会議にでてアメリカ人とかフランス人とかと議論したり、海外講演することになったり、
ユースケース分析、マーケティング、企画、そして、さらに、
デザインや法務や人事や経営の仕事にも首をつっこんだ。
仕事ばかりしてたわけではなく、むしろ、単に気分が乗らないという理由で
しょっちゅう仕事をズル休みして、ニフティのフォーラムで遊んだり、
一日 中DOOMをやっていたり、出会い系でいろんな女の子に会ってみたり、
歴史、文学、経済、科学、哲学、マンガ、など、いろんな分野の本を読み、
フランス、タイ、シンガポール、インドネシア、メキシコ、韓国、アメリカ、ネパールなど、
世界中をバックパッキングし、2チャンネルでレベルの低い厨房文学論争をやってみたり、
NOVAのVOICEルームで外人のお兄ちゃんお姉ちゃんたちと社会問題の議論をしたり。
ようは、肩に力を入れず、頑張らず、努力せず、いやなことから逃げまくって、
そのときの気分しだいで、その時々のやりたいことだけやって、
いいかげんに生きてきた。
もし、ボクが選択と集中という牢獄につながれて生きることを選んだなら、
もしかしたらぼくは、何者かになって、それなりの地位と名誉を確立していたかも知れない。
しかし、それと引き替えに、多様な料理を味わう自由を失い、
「 大好きなステーキだけを朝昼晩強制的に食わされ続けるという地獄」
で一生を終えなければならなかったとしたら、そこまでして
そんな地位だの名誉だのを欲しいとは、とうてい思えないのである。
ましてや、オープンソースだのネットコミュニティのリーダーとなって、
そこに 「人生を埋める」生き方など、たとえ出来たとしても、まっぴらごめんだ。
そりゃ、ほとんど「人柱」でしょ。すこしもうらやましいとは思えない。
もちろん、現実には、 「大好きなステーキを毎日強制的に食わされる牢獄」から
飛び出したところで、そこが常春のお花畑かというと、そんなことはない。
そこには、過酷な自然があり、春夏秋冬があり、ときには稲妻と嵐の荒れ狂うこともある。
牢獄の中よりもはるかに高いレベルで、知恵と勇気を振り絞らないと生きていけない。
それでもなお、その牢獄の中の灰色に塗りつぶされた空間などより、
よっぽど人間らしく生きていけるのではないかと思うのだ。
そもそも、id:umedamochio氏の提唱する「好きを貫く」という生き方は、
いかにも 「 近代人」的だ。
首尾一貫した自立した個人が、理性と主体性をもって社会を形作っていくという、
近代の夢見た一つの理想的人間像だ。
梅田氏は、大組織に縛られた生き方以外の「けものみち」を提唱しているが、
その生き方も結局のところ、近代の美しい夢であった「自立した個人」が
理性の力で対等に結び合って社会を形作るという、思想の枠、
お釈迦様の手のひらの上からはみ出せていない。
しかし、その後の歴史において、この近代の理想的人間像に隠された欺瞞と
インチキと弊害が、さまざまな哲学者や思想家たちによって徹底的に暴かれぬいた。
後に、ポストモダニズムと総括されることになる多様な思想の潮流群だ。
彼らによって、そもそも、首尾一貫した自立した個人などというものが、
ずいぶんと頭のヌルい幻想でしかないことが白日の下に晒された。
「 好きを仕事に」とは言うが、そもそも、そんな確固たる「自立した主体」などという
ものは存在しない 。
「 ほんとうの自分」がどこかにあるはずだと、「自分探し」を続ける若者がよくいるが、
多くの場合、自分なんかいくら探したって見つかりゃしないのである。
自分の 「好き」はいつもふらふらと移り変わっていて、
そんなふうに、カチっと定義づけることなどできやしない。
それを、無理矢理 「ぼくは○○が好きな人間なんだ」などと定義づけるから、
「 好きなステーキを毎日強制的に食わされる牢獄」などに閉じこめられてしまうのだ。
また、意識と無意識の境界も曖昧で、ぼくたちは、いつでも理性によって正しい
判断とやらをしているわけではない。ぼくたちの行動の多くは、多分に無意識に支配されている。
自分とは、そういう、茫漠としてつかみ所が無く、その時々の状況や気分でふわふわと
移り変わっていくところがあり、当然のことながら「好き」だって、ふわふわと移り変わる。
こういうことが、すっかりバレちゃっている現代という時代において、
いまさら、古めかしくかび臭い「近代の理想的人間像」などを持ち出しで
「 好きを貫く」などと言われても、少しもピンとこない。
もちろん、これら、ポストモダンが突きつけた思想的課題を克服した上で、
それでもなお、 「好きを貫く」という思想を構築したというのなら、
それはそれで一本スジの通った主張であり、傾聴に値する。
そして、ぼくが梅田氏に期待したのは、そこの部分だった。
ポストモダンは、近代の安易な理想を徹底的に破壊し尽くしたのはいいのだけど、
壊すだけ壊しておいて、その後に、あるべき人間や社会の理想像を構築できた
かというと、いかにも心許ない。
その点において、少なくともニーチェは、キリスト教、民主主義、科学、哲学など、
既存のメジャーな価値体系が隠蔽している欺瞞と汚物をえぐり出し、徹底的に
その正当性を破壊し尽くした後、「では、人間が目指すべき理想像とはどのようであるべきか」
という、その後の価値創造に腐心している。
あんまり成功したとはいえないけど(笑 ) 。
これに対し、ポストモダンの思想家たちの多くは、近代の理想を、
ぶっ壊すだけ壊しておいて、その後の価値創造において、見るべき成果がない。
だから、現代社会における現実的な諸問題
( たとえば、日本の教育システムはどうあるべきか)などの
解決策を議論するとき、多くの場合ポストモダニズムはものの役に立たない。
むしろ、ポストモダンが徹底的に批判し尽くし、欠陥商品であることがバレバレになったはずの
ヘーゲル思想の方が、人々の間にコンセンサスを作り出し、より多くの人を納得させる
よりよい教育システムを構築するために、はるかに思考のベースとして役に立って
しまうほどだ 。
この意味で、一見、上から目線で近代をこき下ろし、
すっかり近代を乗り越えたはずのポストモダンは、
ボク的な感覚では、とてもじゃないが、きちんと近代を乗り越えたとは言えない。
だから、ボクは梅田氏に、本来、広がり伸びていく人間の自由な精神を、
堅苦しい枠に閉じこめて殺してしまう、古めかしくかび臭い近代の
呪いを破壊し尽くしたポストモダンを、さらに乗り越えて、
その向こうに新たな理想の生き方を示してくれることを期待した。
しかし彼は、あの、すっかり欠陥商品であることが
バレバレになってしまっている、古めかしい「近代」に、WebとかITとかいう
ペンキを塗り直して持ち出しただけだった。
もちろん 、Web時代に はWeb時代の生き方がある。
たとえば 、Webは、それまで企業しか持ち得なかった「 販売チャネル 」 を
全ての「個人」に解放したという、ただそれだけの側面を捉えただけでも、
社会的、文化的、経済的に、とてつもなく巨大な革命であり、
その販売チャネルを使って 「自分という商品」を売り込まない手はないし、
そうすることで、企業と個人の関係は劇的に変わっていくはずだし、
とうぜん、社会の構造も、文化も、個々人の生き方も、
いままでとはドラスティックに違ったものになっていくだろう。
しかしそんなことは、数世紀前に歴史の歯車の回転の速度が上がり始めてからは、
いつの時代も起こり続けてきたことで、現代の変化だけがとりたてて特別だと言うこともない。
印刷機のないところに印刷機ができたり、
陸地に閉じこもっている時代から大航海時代になったり、

人類史上初めて全世界規模で高齢化社会になったり、
共産主義が一時的にはかなりの成功を収めながら、結局は崩壊したりして、
社会構造や人々の生き方に、その都度とてつもない大革命を引き起こしてきた。
そのたびに、人生の戦略とビジョンを、根本から見直さなければならないほどの、
大革命が起き続けてきた。
それは絶え間ない大変化であり、それぞれに区切りをつけようと思えばつけられなくはないが、
それらは多分に恣意的なもので、区切ることにさほどの意味はない。
この Web時代の進化は、ますます加速度的に大変化をしていく連続的な
流れの中に埋まっており、それだけが他と比べて特別な「革命」というほどでもない。
むしろ、軍事主体の世界が経済主体の世界にパワーシフトしたことの方が、

無限に成長すると信じられていた日本経済の高度成長が終わったことの方が、
Web進化なんかより、はるかに人々の人生戦略へのインパクトは大きかっただろう。
こういう何百年も続く絶え間ない大変化の中で、
われわれがどう生きていくか、新しい人間像や生き方のモデルを指し示すには、
単に新しい時代の変化に適応するための場当たり的な処方箋を示すだけでは、足りない。
過去に我々がひとたび理想と信じ、そして夢破れた教訓をふまえ、
その上で、新しい人間像を提示して、はじめて地に足がついていると言えるのではないだろうか。
その意味で、近代が夢見た理想の人間像に、つぎつぎに欠陥が見つかり、
それを暴き立て、破壊し尽くしたポストモダンを乗り越えて、
さらにその向こうに新しい人間像、人間の生き方を示すことなくして、
「 現代という時代にそった新しい生き方」を提示すると、どうしても陳腐になってしまう。
実は、この問題意識は、このブログ自体のテーマでもあり、
「 分裂勘違い君劇場」というタイトルは、そこから来ている。
私は何者でもなく、私の意識は分裂して、多重人格で、勘違いの上に勘違いが重なり、
しょっちゅう自分で言ったことの正反対のことを言っていて、
一貫性がないどころか、わざと一貫性のない態度をつらぬき 、
一貫した思想をあがめ奉る人々に対して 、
真正面から挑戦状をたたきつけている。
そして、そこに、近代が生み出した理想の人間像という呪いの
拘束具を食い破って自らを解放し、人生を謳歌するための鍵が埋まっているのではないかと感じている。
イメージ的には、ちょうど 「生物と無生物のあいだ」という本で描かれている
「 生命体の本質」に近い 。
。。。私たちが食べた分子は、瞬く間に全身に散らばり、一時、緩くそこにとどまり、
次の瞬間には身体から抜け出ていくことを証明した。
つまり、私たち生命体の身体はプラモデルのような静的なパーツから成り立っている
分子機械ではなく、パーツ自体のダイナミックな流れの中に成り立っている。
＜略＞こ の「動的平衡」論をもとに、生物を無生物から区別するものは何かを、
私たちの生命観の変遷と共に考察したのが本書である。
( 強調は引用者による )
生命体が「流れ」そのものであるように、いろんな思考、アイデア、感情、感覚、欲望が
常に入れ替わり、移ろいゆき、「流れ」として自分の精神を形作っている。
それは動的平衡を保つという形でのみ「自分」を形成しており、どこかに
固定化された静的な「自分」などというものがあるわけではない。
「 自立した個人」という近代の理想的人間像が人間を拘束し、灰色の部屋に閉じこめ圧殺してしまうのは、
人間の精神が静的なものであることを前提とするという過ちから来ているのではないか。
人間の精神が静的なものでない以上、自分の中の「好き」も静的に固定化することなど出来ず、
そんな静的な自分を求めて、インドやタイに「自分探しの旅」に出かけたところで、
「 本当の自分」などという静的な状態を見いだすことなどできやしない。
好きを貫こうにも、そもそもそんな静的な「好き」など存在しない。
好きというのは、努力して見いだして貫くようなものではなく、
自然体で生きているうちに、結果として動的平衡として好きなことをやっている自分という
状態になるのではないか。
そして、ボク的には、そのイメージが、２ちゃんねる管理人のひろゆき氏の生き方に重なる。
いかにも古めかしく暑苦しい近代的な梅田思想に比べ、
肩の力の抜けたひろゆき氏が自然体で語りかける言葉の一つ一つは、
はるかに現代的で洗練されており、次の時代を生きるためのヒントがあるように思う。
必死で努力し、ガマンして毎日ステーキを食べつづけなくても、
肩の力を抜いて、ふらふら、だらだらしながら、自然体でサービスを作り出した方が、
むしろ、より次の時代にふさわしい、新時代を切り開くような洗練されたサービスを
開発できるのではないだろうか。
真に強烈な打撃は、脱力とリラックスから生み出されるというのは、
さまざなまスポーツと格闘技の基本だ。
これが、ステーキが大好きな僕が、いま、血の滴るステーキではなく、
納豆かけご飯と塩鮭とほうれん草のおひたしを食べ、
バランスボールをポヨンポヨンさせながら、この記事を書いている理由であり、
明日もまた、やはりステーキの好きな僕は、オニオンスライスとシーチキンの
和え物でも食べようかと思いつつ、気が変わってカレーライスでも食べているかも
しれない理由なのである。

Emirates law on male rape need updating , relatives say
The boy , 15 , testified in private against his alleged attackers , aged 36 , 18 and one who is a minor .
The boy 's relatives say the three , one of whom is HIV positive , took him into the desert and raped him at knifepoint .
His mother accuses the authorities of lying about the 36 - year - old 's HIV infection to hide the fact that Aids is present in the United Arab Emirates .
The defendants - who deny the charges - have not been identified in the case , in line with UAE law .
Veronique Robert , the mother , has been campaigning for more protection for underage rape victims in the Emirates .
Dubai officials have defended their handling of the case but have not commented on the mother 's accusations .
' Official silence '
Ms Robert said her son cried during his 90 - minute testimony on Wednesday , but remained " very strong " .
" He looked the defendants in the eyes and gave a chance for justice to be served , " she told Associated Press news agency .
He told police three men abducted him and a friend , 16 , from a shopping centre in the booming Gulf emirate which is a regional tourism and business hub .
The men allegedly took turns raping him in the back seat of their car .
The 16 - year - old , who was told to sit behind a sand dune , also testified on Wednesday .
Ms Robert has said during a forensic examination the police doctor accused her son of being homosexual , implying the incident was consensual .
She also says official silence about the 36 - year - old 's positive HIV test meant her son missed out on possible treatment .
" Aids is a taboo subject here ...
The government played with the life of my child , " she said .
The boy left Dubai fearing he would be prosecuted for homosexuality , a crime in the Emirates , but returned when the authorities said he would not be charged .
The two adult defendants could face life imprisonment or the death penalty if convicted .
The third defendant could face 10 years imprisonment if convicted by a juvenile court .
The trial was adjourned until Sunday .
The investigation reveals that large corporations are creating elaborate structures to move profits through subsidiaries to offshore centres such as the Cayman Islands , Bermuda and the British Virgin Islands , to avoid handing money over to tax collectors in the countries where their goods are produced , and in those where they are consumed .
Governments at both ends of the chain are increasingly being deprived of the ability to raise tax for development or services .
Dole , Chiquita , and Fresh Del Monte , the three companies that supply several UK supermarkets and between them control more than two thirds of the worldwide banana trade , generated over $ 50 bn ( £ 24bn ) of sales and $ 1.4bn of global profits in the last five years .
Yet they paid just $ 200 m , or just over 14 % of profits , in taxes between them over that period , our analysis of their financial accounts reveals .
In some years the banana companies have paid an effective tax rate as low as 8 % , even though the standard rate in the US where they have their headquarters and file their full accounts is 35 % .
The banana companies are not alone .
Nearly a third of the UK's 700 largest businesses paid no corporation tax in the year 2005 - 06 .
A further third paid less than £ 10 m each , according to figures from the National Audit Office .
The use of offshore havens by rich individuals to avoid paying tax was high on the political agenda this autumn , with Gordon Brown matching the Conservatives ' pledge to tax " non doms " .
But increasingly , the far bigger challenge for government is how to keep up with the strategies being developed by large corporations to cut their tax bills .
About 60 % of world trade now consists of internal transfers within transnational companies , according to the OECD .
By weighting their costs towards countries such as the UK or the US that have higher rates of tax , corporations can make little taxable profit in those countries .
Instead their profits are weighted towards subsidiaries they have set up in jurisdictions that charge little or no tax .
Del Monte Fresh Produce UK , Chiquita UK and Dole 's UK business , JP Fresh , report combined sales in the UK of over £ 400 m in their most recently filed annual accounts .
Yet between them they paid only £ 128,000 in UK tax .
Fresh Del Monte , currently the supplier of the vast majority of Asda 's bananas and some of Morrisons ' , is registered in the Cayman Islands and has more than 30 Cayman subsidiaries .
The Caymans have a zero rate of corporation tax .
It also has subsidiaries in other tax havens including Gibraltar , Bermuda , the Dutch Antilles and the British Virgin Islands .
Over the last five years its actual tax paid has been as much as $ 69 m a year less than tax calculated at the standard US corporation rate .
Dole , which supplies bananas to Tesco in the UK , paid actual tax that was $ 20 m a year less than tax at the standard US rate .
Its accounts only list its largest subsidiaries , but these include companies in Bermuda , Liberia and Puerto Rico .
Chiquita , which also supplies Tesco , lists 11 subsidiaries in Bermuda at the end of 2006 .
Our analysis of its accounts over five years shows that its actual tax paid is as much as $ 44 m less a year than US standard rates .
In a double blow to the developing countries where the bananas are produced , the fall in tax as a percentage of profit paid by the large corporations has coincided with ruthless driving down of costs .
Wages have been reduced on plantations even as working hours have been increased .
Fair trade campaign group Banana Link says Fresh Del Monte sacked all 4,300 of its workers on its Monte Libano plantations in Costa Rica in 1999 and re-employed people on reduced wages and benefits , a model it later rolled out across all its plantations .
Chiquita 's plantation labour costs meanwhile , which were 5 % of its total costs in 2004 , had been cut to just 2 % in 2006 .
Richard Murphy , a tax expert who advised the NAO on its report on the performance of the UK Revenue and Customs , said that large companies are effectively now able to set their own tax rates .
" Corporation tax is falling worldwide as a percentage of profits .
Corporations seem to be deciding what they should pay , not as a percentage like the rest of us , but as a sum above which they do n't want to go . "
John Christensen , a former economic adviser to the Jersey government and director of the campaign group Tax Justice Network , said the Guardian investigation confirmed that the flight of capital was continuing , having reached unprecedented levels in the 1990s .
" The trend in the last 30 years has been to shift the burden of tax away from companies on to the consumer and labour .
Capital is increasingly going untaxed . "
Dole declined to comment on the Guardian 's detailed allegations , saying that they involved confidential and proprietary information .
Chiquita said it complied with all tax laws in the jurisdictions where it does business .
Chiquita added that " a significant portion of our earnings occur outside the US where they are subject to taxation at the local tax rate " .
Both companies say they are working with the Latin American unions to address workers ' rights .
Fresh Del Monte said it too operated in many countries and complied with all local tax law and international tax treaties .
It added that it also complied with all local labour laws , was a strong proponent of freedom of association , and that the average wage of its agricultural employees in the countries where it operates exceeds the mandated minimum agricultural wage .
There was an interesting article in the San Francisco Chronicle on Sunday called Fairfield balances on the edge as housing prices plunge .
The article mentions Fairfield California specifically , but it is really about hundreds of similar towns across the nation facing the same problems .
Let 's tune in .
If you want to see how the housing bust is affecting business in the Bay Area , there 's no better place to look than Fairfield .
Housing in this bustling Solano County city is in an outright depression .
Home prices are plummeting , buyers are running for cover and , in September and October , not a single home building permit was issued , the first time that 's happened in the memory of city officials .
" People still seem to be employed .
There 's still a lot going on , " said Stu Reid , owner of the home remodeling business Kitchen Tune - Up .
" While people may be talking more cautiously , they 're still going out to dinner , still playing golf .
You still see long lines at Starbucks . "
That 's right now .
The question on everybody 's mind is how long can the city 's economy stay healthy with housing in tatters .
Fairfield , it seems , is a city on the knife 's edge .
New - car sales at Thomason Autogroup , which owns nine franchises in Fairfield , have edged down about 5 percent in the past year , due in part to homeowners who can no longer easily get home - equity loans .
" Our customers appear to have less disposable cash , " said Thomason president Pancho Redfern .
Fairfield plumbing and engineering contractor Amos & Andrews has already seen the residential portion of its business plunge about 75 percent .
Now it 's steeling itself for a slump in the commercial and industrial side of its business .
" There 's usually a slowdown in that market segment six to nine months after housing , " said company Vice President Gary Andrews .
" We would anticipate the downturn mid-year next year . "
Members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers are fully employed on such projects , even though the union had to cut back its residential apprenticeship program to six slots from 15 .
But union leaders worry the strength of commercial construction wo n't last .
" If the industrial portion goes , then we 're in real trouble , " said Lou Franchimon , business manager of Napa - Solano Building Trades Council .
At Amos & Andrews , " all of a sudden , it just fell off a cliff , " Andrews said of the company 's work on residential projects .
At flooring contractor Campbell 's Carpets , sales are down 39 percent despite aggressive discounting .
" We 're as low as we can go , " said manager Jose Vera .
" We ca n't go any lower . "
Redfern at Thomason Autogroup said he expects sales to continue slipping for the next six to eight months .
But , like many area businesspeople , he 's convinced Fairfield will pull through tough times and that its long - term prospects are bright .
" You would think there would be more depression and despair , " he said , noting that his own house has lost about $ 140,000 in appraised value in a year .
" But in this market here , there 's still some strange optimism .
People have n't thrown in the towel .
...
People are still moving into this market .
We remain optimistic . "

Who taught Elvis how to dance , received the Congressional Medal of Honor , got Nixon impeached , became the world ping - pong champion , built a national shrimping empire , and fathered Haley Joel Osment ?
One man : Forrest Gump .
If I could choose one mentor in business , or in life in general , it would be Gump .
I do n’t care that he ’s not real .
The wisdom that he conveys is real , and I think we could all learn something from it .
Let ’s listen to what he has to say , and I ’ll translate his Gumpisms into advice that , if followed , will make you a much more successful moneymaker :
And cause I was a gazillionaire , and I liked doin it so much , I cut that grass for free .
The whole point of making lots of money is to buy your freedom .
If that means cutting grass , then by all means , cut the grass .
Many wealthy people chase money for so long that they forget about everything else .
It ’s a mistake .
Never become so obsessed that you lose touch with the little things in life that you enjoy .
I ’m not a smart man … but I know what love is .
Smarts are n’t everything .
You can have an IQ of 180 , but if you do n’t know care about other people , you ’ll never understand your customers or win the support of your peers .
Instead , learn to care .
Give customers the products they truly need , support your coworkers , and build a company that not only makes a profit but somehow changes the world for the better .
Stupid is as stupid does .
While you ’re at it , change your entire conception of smart .
In the end , the people that we call geniuses are n’t the ones with high IQs ; they ’re the people that make the right decisions over and over again .
Similarly , lots of people with high IQs do stupid stuff … like not putting the gun together when the drill sergeant tells them to .
When I got tired , I slept .
When I got hungry , I ate .
When I had to go … you know …
I went .
Only a fool goes without sleep , survives on fast food , and refuses to take breaks .
You ’ll burn out after a few years , where someone that takes care of themselves stays productive until they ’re 90 .
You can still do great things ; just realize you ’re not going to do them in one day .
Healthy careers last decades , and you ’ll need a healthy body to go the distance .
Momma always had a way of explaining things so I could understand them .
In the world of business and wealth creation .
This will translate into finding experts in your field and getting them to mentor you .
Many online training courses offer mentorship as part of their curriculum as they understand the value it can bring when it comes to personal and professional transformation .
To give you an example , the ASM Amazing Selling Machine course is an Amazon FBA training that provides 1 to 1 mentorship from successful Amazon business owners .
This alone is worth its weight in gold .
Find a mentor .
Maybe it ’s your Momma , or maybe it ’s a blogger that tells it like it is ( ah hem ) .
The point is you ca n’t figure it all out on your own , and you should n’t try .
Look for people that explain things in just the right way for you to understand them , and then expose yourself to as much of their wisdom as possible .
I gotta save Bubba !
Do n’t turn into another corporate coward that leaves people behind when things go bad .
The real heroes in business are willing to lose everything for the people around them .
Nothing creates more loyalty than selflessness , and it ’s more valuable than gold .
Besides , if you ’re wealthy , you should have some nice , cushy buttocks to protect you against that million - dollar wound .
Jenny taught me how to climb .
And I taught her how to dangle .
No one gets rich alone .
If someone shows you how to “ climb ” the ladder of success , then do n’t forget about them when they ’re “ dangling ” from it , about fall off .
Help them dangle more gracefully , or reciprocate any other chance you get .
It ’s not about keeping score , exactly , but creating an attitude of generosity in both yourself and others .
That ’s how you get to the top .
My Momma always said you ’ve got to put the past behind you before you can move on .
Sometimes , the smartest thing you can do in life is let go .
If your company has been on the verge of bankruptcy for two years with no reasonable hope of recovering , then maybe it ’s time to jump ship .
Or , just as importantly , you can only ride on past successes for so long before its time to do something new .
Either way , do n’t let the past distract you from the future you want to create .
I ’m sorry I had to fight in the middle of your Black Panther party .
Apologize , even if you ’re not wrong .
It ’s better than getting your ass kicked ( or fired ) .
Now you would n’t believe me if I told you , but I could run like the wind blows .
Brag .
Shamelessly .
Of course , I ’m not talking about writing a press release about how you got an A on your term paper , but if you ’ve done something genuinely remarkable , then you owe it to people to tell them about it .
Do it with a little style , and they ’ll love you for it .
Forrest spends the entire movie bragging , and people skip their bus to find out what happens next .
My Momma always said , “ Life is like a box of chocolates .
You never know what you ’re gonna get . ”
How could I not include this one ?
Instead of worrying about which job you should take , which project you should work on , or which company you should start , just line them all up , choose the one you think you ’ll like , and take a bite .
You ’ll probably enjoy them all , but it ’s only by “ tasting ” the opportunities in life that you ’ll truly live .
That ’s all I have to say about that .
When you ’ve said all you have to say … shut up .

The International Space Station 's school bus -sized Harmony node ( top ) is moved into place at the front of the outpost 's U.S. Destiny lab on Nov. 12 , 2007 .
NASAengineers are tracking a potential , albeit minor , leak aboard the InternationalSpace Station ( ISS ) , but do not consider it a concern for the orbital lab 's astronautcrew or an upcoming shuttle launch , the agency said Wednesday .
An inspectionof a vestibule bridging the station 's new Harmonyconnecting module and NASA 's Destiny laboratory indicated a slight air leakof about three pounds ( 1.3 kilograms ) per day , NASA spokesperson Lynette Madison , of the agency 's Johnson Space Center , told SPACE.com Wednesday .
But whether the leak is genuineor merely a phantom signal has yet to be determined .
A close - upinspection of the vestibule seal by the station 's three - astronaut Expedition 16 crew using an ultrasonic leak detector found no trace of a leak on Wednesday , Madison said .
Studies of the station 's overall internal pressurealso found no signs of decay , she added .
Engineersfirst recorded the potential leak during a " fine " check this week to ensureHarmony is properly connected to its Destiny docking port , Madison said .
Aless sensitive , " gross " leak check performed earlier this monthyielded no issues , she added .
" Nobodyis really concerned about this , " Madison said .
Engineersplan to check the seals between Harmony and its shuttle docking port for leakson Thursday , and may recheck the module 's connection to the Destiny lab laterthis week , she added .
Astronautsdelivered the school bus -sized Harmony node to the ISS in late October during NASA 's STS - 120 shuttle flight .
The station 's Expedition 16 crew outfitted the module witha shuttle docking port earlier this month and performed three spacewalks in15 days to move the nearly 16 - ton node to its final perch at the front of Destiny .
With itsmultiple berthing ports , Harmony is designed to serve as the anchor point for Europeanand Japanese laboratories beginning with the European Space Agency 's Columbusmodule set to launch next week .
NASA 'sshuttle Atlantis and seven astronauts are slated to launch toward the ISS onDec. 6 to deliver Columbus and swap out one member of the station 's Expedition 16 crew .
Top shuttle officials will meet Friday at NASA 's Kennedy Space Centerin Cape Canaveral , Fla. , to set a firm launch date for the planned 11 - day mission .

Can a musical genre be considered so dangerous as to be banned from the radio ?
Yes , according to the authorities in some parts of Mexico who have forced radio stations to take action in an attempt to stamp out the culture of " narco corridos " , which they accuse of glamorising drug trafficking and gangsterism .
Los Tigres del Norte are the foremost exponents of the narco corrido Corridos , or ballads , have been a Mexican tradition - especially in the north of the country - for at least 100 years .
The songs , based on polkas and waltzes , feature lyrics backed by accordions and brass bands .
The Mexican Revolution , which lasted from 1910 to 1917 , triggered hundreds of corridos about legendary figures such as Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata .
But over the past 30 years the biggest growth area has been the narco corridos , which are based on the real lives of drug smugglers .
Efforts to ban narco corridos Mar 2001 : The Mexican state of Sinaloa announces a " voluntary " ban on the broadcast of narco corridos Jan 2002 : Congress in the state of Chihuahua passes a bill " inviting " radio stations to ban narco corridos May 2002 : Government says it cannot enforce a national ban on narco corridos because of right to freedom of speech Jul 2002 :
The state of Baja California Norte signs a " voluntary " ban agreement with radio stations Oct 2002 :
The state of Nuevo Leon bans narco corridos
Among those heavily featured are the Arellano - Felix brothers , who ran a drugs cartel in the border city of Tijuana , and their arch-rival Amado Carrillo Fuentes , aka Lord Of The Skies , who was based in another frontier town , Ciudad Juarez .
Elijah Wald , a former blues guitarist who has written a book on narco corridos , told BBC News Online : " The first thing a drug runner would do after a successful run was to hire someone to write a corrido about it . "
Corrido performers normally charge thousands of dollars , or tens of thousands of pesos , to write and perform such a piece .
Mr Wald said : " I spoke to one corrido writer who wanted to be smuggled into the US .
The smuggler would normally charge $ 1,500 but he did it for free provided the writer wrote a corrido about it . "
Jessie Morales ' image is popular with gang members in LA Also popular are immigration corridos , such as Tres Veces Mojado ( Three Times A Wetback ) which was also made into a movie .
Mr Wald said most narco corrido writers and performers would deny writing bespoke songs for the drug barons .
" I asked one of the most well known , Reynaldo Martinez , if he wrote corridos for hire .
He said ' No , but sometimes someone who likes one of my songs might give me a Land Rover . '
Mr Wald said : " Los Tigres del Norte are the kings of the kings and I would be surprised if they had ever taken any money . "
Corridos , and narco corridos , were now " ubiquitous " in Mexico and had spread to California , Texas , Florida and other places with large Hispanic populations , according to Mr Wald .
They have also become popular in Colombia and in other parts of central America , such as El Salvador .
Click here for a map showing how narco corridos have spread
In the US the market for Mexican regional music , including narco corridos , is worth about $ 300 m a year , with Los Angeles being the hub of the narco corrido industry .
Los Tigres ' most recent album sold nearly 500,000 copies in the US alone .
Corridos are a tradition that has been going since the Mexican Revolution
Mariluz Gonzalez
Univision Records
Two of the newest stars , Lupillo Rivera and Jessie Morales , sport the shaven heads and jewellery fashionable with Hispanic gang members in East LA .
While gangsta rap has Tupac Shakur , narco corrido has Rosalino " Chalino " Sanchez , who was murdered in Culiacan , the capital of the chaotic state of Sinaloa in May 1992 .
He had earlier been involved in a shoot - out with a gunman at a gig .
Mariluz Gonzalez , a spokeswoman for LA - based Fonovisa Records , which represents Los Tigres and several other narco corrido stars , said : " They are not glamorising the drug dealers ' lives , they are simply telling a story .
They are not promoting it . "
Grupo Exterminador 's songs tend to parody narco corrido
But the Mexican authorities , appalled at what they see as the glamorising of drug smugglers and gangsters , have sought to ban the genre .
The Federal Communications Commission has also taken action against several Spanish - language radio stations in the US .
The Mexican Senate , unable to act itself because of freedom of speech legislation , exhorted individual states to restrict narco corridos , saying the songs " create a virtual justification for drug traffickers " .
Since 2001 several Mexican states have negotiated " voluntary " bans with local radio stations in an attempt to keep narco corridos off the airwaves .
' Bad example ' Mario Enrique Mayans Concha , president of the Baja California branch of Mexico's Chamber of Radio and Television Industry , said : " Narco - ballads set a bad example for the younger generation . "
Antonio Mejias - Rentas , entertainment editor with the Los Angeles - based La Opinion newspaper , said : " There is a mixed feeling about them in the Mexican community ; while there is an appreciation for the art form , there is also concern about the glorification of violence and drug consumption , much like in the gangsta rap world . "
He said Los Tigres were generally well - regarded , adding : " Some of their narco - themed songs are regarded as classics , but lately they are better known for songs about immigration and other social concerns . "
Fonovisa 's Mariluz Gonzalez said : " Corridos are a tradition that has been going since the Mexican Revolution .
La Banda Del Carro Rojo ( The Red Car Gang ) was a popular earlier narco corrido " They are a way of telling the people what is going on .
It might be the truth or it could be twisted , you can't really tell . "
She admitted : " There are some groups who have taken money and glorified these narcos . "
But she said the Mexican authorities had often taken action as a way of muffling criticism .
" The Tigres put out a song earlier this year called Las Mujeres del Juarez which was about the murders of women in Ciudad Juarez , which is a very controversial subject , and the local government did not like it . "
Despite being banned from the airwaves on both sides of the border narco corrido artists continue to sell well , Ms Gonzalez said .

Tens of thousands of Mexicans were trapped on rooftops and others clung to lightposts today after heavy rains flooded nearly the entire southern state of Tabasco .
At least 500,000 people were made homeless and one person was killed in the worst flooding the swampy state has seen in more than 50 years , officials said .
The floods began last week and now cover 80 per cent of Tabasco , affecting about one million people , officials said .

NAIROBI ( Reuters ) - A giant spitting cobra , measuring nearly nine feet and carrying enough venom to kill at least 15 people , has been discovered in Kenya , a conservation group said on Friday .
WildlifeDirect said the snake it described as the world ’s largest had been recognized as a new species and named the Naja Ashei after James Ashe , who founded a snake farm on Kenya ’s coast where the massive serpents are found .
“ A new species of giant spitting cobra is exciting and reinforces the obvious -- that there have to be many other unreported species but hundreds are being lost as their habitats disappear under the continued mismanagement of our planet , ” said the group ’s chairman , Kenyan environmentalist Richard Leakey .
Spitting cobras , able to launch poison over a distance of several meters , are common to Kenya ’s lowland climates .
WildlifeDirect said the discovery would help find an anti-venom for the bite .
“ Lives can be saved , ” it added .
Ashe , now deceased , was the first to catch a larger - than - normal spitting cobra in the 1960s , and suggest it belonged to a different species .
April 2002 : Stop Over -Engineering !
The great thing about software patterns is that they convey many useful design ideas .
It follows , therefore , that if you learn a bunch of these patterns , you 'll be a pretty good software designer , right ?
I considered myself just that once I 'd learned and used dozens of patterns .
They helped me develop flexible frameworks and build robust and extensible software systems .
After a couple of years , however , I discovered that my knowledge of patterns and the way I used them frequently led me to over - engineer my work .
Once my design skills had improved , I found myself using patterns in a different way : I began refactoring to patterns , instead of using them for up - front design or introducing them too early into my code .
My new way of working with patterns emerged from my adoption of Extreme Programming design practices , which helped me avoid both over - and under - engineering .
Zapping Productivity
What does it mean to over - engineer ?
When you make your code more flexible or sophisticated than it needs to be , you over - engineer it .
Some do this because they believe they know their system 's future requirements .
They reason that it 's best to make a design more flexible or sophisticated today , so it can accommodate the needs of tomorrow .
That sounds reasonable , if you happen to be a psychic .
But if your predictions are wrong , you waste precious time and money .
It 's not uncommon to spend days or weeks fine - tuning an overly flexible or unnecessarily sophisticated software design leaving you with less time to add new behavior or remove defects from a system .
What typically happens with code you produce in anticipation of needs that never materialize ?
It does n't get removed , because it 's inconvenient to do so , or because you expect that one day the code will be needed .
Regardless of the reason , as overly flexible or unnecessarily sophisticated code accumulates , you and the rest of the programmers on your team , especially new members , must operate within a code base that 's bigger and more complicated than it needs to be .
To compensate for this , folks decide to work in discrete areas of the system .
This seems to make their jobs easier , but it has the unpleasant side effect of generating copious amounts of duplicate code , since everyone works in his or her own comfortable area of the system , rarely looking elsewhere for code that already does what he or she needs .
Over -engineered code affects productivity because when someone inherits an over - engineered design , they must spend time learning the nuances of that design before they can comfortably extend or maintain it .
Over -engineering tends to happen quietly : Many architects and programmers are n't even aware they do it .
And while their organizations may discern a decline in team productivity , few know that over - engineering is playing a role in the problem .
Perhaps the main reason programmers over - engineer is that they do n't want to get stuck with a bad design .
A bad design can weave its way so deeply into code that improving it becomes an enormous challenge .
I 've been there , and that 's why up - front design with patterns appealed to me so much .
The Patterns Panacea
When I first began learning patterns , they represented a flexible , sophisticated and even elegant way of doing object - oriented design that I very much wanted to master .
After thoroughly studying the patterns , I used them to improve systems I 'd already built and to formulate designs for systems I was about to build .
Since the results of these efforts were promising , I was sure I was on the right path .
But over time , the power of patterns led me to lose sight of simpler ways of writing code .
After learning that there were two or three different ways to do a calculation , I 'd immediately race toward implementing the Strategy pattern , when , in fact , a simple conditional expression would have been a perfectly sufficient solution .
On one occasion , my preoccupation with patterns became quite apparent .
I was pair programming , and my partner and I had written a class that implemented Java 's TreeModel interface in order to display a graph of Spec objects in a tree widget .
Our code worked , but the tree widget was displaying each Spec by calling its toString ( ) method , which did n't return the Spec information we wanted .
We could n't change Spec's toString ( ) method since other parts of the system relied on its contents .
So we reflected on how to proceed .
As was my habit , I considered which patterns could help .
The Decorator pattern came to mind , and I suggested that we use it to wrap Spec with an object that could override the toString ( ) method .
My partner 's response to this suggestion surprised me .
" Using a Decorator here would be like applying a sledgehammer when a few light taps with a small hammer would do . "
His solution was to create a small class called NodeDisplay , whose constructor took a Spec instance , and whose one public method , toString ( ) , obtained the correct display information from the Spec instance .
NodeDisplay took no time to program , since it was less than 10 simple lines of code .
My Decorator solution would have involved creating more than 50 lines of code , with many repetitive delegation calls to the Spec instance .
Experiences like this made me aware that I needed to stop thinking so much about patterns and refocus on writing small , simple , straightforward code .
I was at a crossroads : I 'd worked hard to learn patterns to become a better software designer , but now I needed to relax my reliance on them in order to become truly better .
Going Too Fast
Improving also meant learning to not under - engineer .
Under - engineering is far more common than over - engineering .
We under - engineer when we become exclusively focused on quickly adding more and more behavior to a system without regard for improving its design along the way .
Many programmers work this way I know I sure have .
You get code working , move on to other tasks and never make time to improve the code you wrote .
Of course , you 'd love to have time to improve your code , but you either do n't get around to it , or you listen to managers or customers who say we 'll all be more competitive and successful if we simply do n't fix what ain't broke .
That advice , unfortunately , does n't work so well with respect to software .
It leads to the " fast , slow , slower " rhythm of software development , which goes something like this :
You quickly deliver release 1.0 of a system , but with junky code .
You attempt to deliver release 2.0 of the system , but the junky code slows you down .
As you attempt to deliver future releases , you go slower and slower as the junky code multiplies , until people lose faith in the system , the programmers and even the process that got everyone into this position .
That kind of experience is far too common in our industry .
It makes organizations less competitive than they could be .
But there is a better way .
Socratic Development
Test - first programming and merciless refactoring , two of the many excellent Extreme Programming practices , dramatically improved the way I build software .
I found that these two practices have helped me and the organizations I 've worked for spend less time over - engineering and under - engineering , and more time designing just what we need : well - built systems , produced on time .
Test - first programming enables the efficient evolution of working code by turning programming into what Kent Beck once likened to a Socratic dialogue :
Write test code to ask your system a question , write system code to respond to the question and keep the dialogue going until you 've programmed what you need .
This rhythm of programming put my head in a different place .
Instead of thinking about a design that would work for every nuance of a system , test - first programming enabled me to make a primitive piece of behavior work correctly before evolving it to the next necessary level of sophistication .
Merciless refactoring is an integral part of this evolutionary design process .
A refactoring is a " behavior - preserving transformation , " or , as Martin Fowler defined it , " a change made to the internal structure of software to make it easier to understand and cheaper to modify without changing its observable behavior " ( Refactoring : Improving the Design of Existing Code , Addison - Wesley , 1999 ) .
Merciless refactoring resembles the way Socrates continually helped dialogue participants improve their answers to his questions by weeding out inessentials , clarifying ambiguities and consolidating ideas .
When you mercilessly refactor , you relentlessly poke and prod your code to remove duplication , clarify and simplify .
The trick to merciless refactoring is to not schedule time to make small design improvements , but to make them whenever your code needs them .
The resulting quality of your code will enable you to sustain a healthy pace of development .
Martin Fowler documents a rich catalog of refactorings , each of which identifies a common need for an improvement and the steps for making that improvement .
Why Refactor to Patterns ?
On various projects , I 've observed what and how my colleagues and I refactor .
While we use many of the refactorings described in Fowler 's book , we also find places where patterns can help us improve our designs .
At such times , we refactor to patterns , being careful not to produce overly flexible or unnecessarily sophisticated solutions .
When I explored the motivation for refactoring to patterns , I found that it was identical to the motivation for implementing nonpatterns - based refactorings : to reduce or remove duplication , simplify the unsimple and make our code better at communicating its intention .
However , the motivation for refactoring to patterns is not the primary motivation for using patterns that is documented in the patterns literature .
For example , let 's look at the documented Intent and Applicability of the Decorator pattern ( see Design Patterns : Elements of Reusable Object - Oriented Software by Erich Gamma , et al. Addison - Wesley , 1994 ) and then examine Erich Gamma and Kent Beck 's motivation for refactoring to Decorator in their excellent , patterns - dense testing framework , JUnit .
Decorator 's Intent : Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically .
Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality .
Decorator 's Applicability :
To add responsibilities to individual objects dynamically and transparently ; that is , without affecting other objects .
For responsibilities that can be withdrawn .
When extension by subclassing is impractical .
Sometimes a large number of independent extensions are possible and could produce an explosion of subclasses to support every combination , or a class definition may be hidden or otherwise unavailable for subclassing .
Motivation for Refactoring to Decorator in JUnit : Gamma remembered the following reason for refactoring to Decorator : " Someone added TestSetup support as a subclass of TestSuite , and once we added RepeatedTestCase and ActiveTest Case , we saw that we could reduce code duplication by introducing the TestSetup Decorator . "
( Note : This was from a private e-mail . )
Can you see how the motivation for refactoring to Decorator ( reducing code duplication ) had very little connection with Decorator 's Intent or Applicability ( a dynamic alternative to subclassing ) ?
I noticed similar disconnects when I looked at motivations for refactorings to other patterns .
Consider the examples in the table below .
Based on these observations , I began to document a catalog of refactorings to patterns to illustrate when it makes sense to make design improvements with patterns .
( To see the work - in - progress , visit http://industriallogic.com/xp/refactoring/ ) .
For this work , it 's essential to show refactorings from real - world projects in order to accurately describe the kinds of forces that lead to justifiable transformations to a pattern .
My work on refactoring to patterns is a direct continuation of work that Martin Fowler began in his excellent catalog of refactorings , in which he included the following refactorings to patterns :
Form Template Method
Introduce Null Object
Replace Constructor with Factory Method
Replace Type Code with State / Strategy
Duplicate Observed Data
Fowler also noted the natural relation between patterns and refactorings .
Patterns are where you want to be ; refactorings are ways to get there from somewhere else .
This idea agrees with the observation made in Design Patterns : " Our design patterns capture many of the structures that result from refactoring .
Design patterns thus provide targets for your refactorings . "
Evolutionary Design
Today , after having become quite familiar with patterns , the " structures that result from refactoring , " I know that understanding good reasons to refactor to a pattern are more valuable than understanding the result of a pattern or the nuances of implementing that result .
If you 'd like to become a better software designer , studying the evolution of great software designs will be more valuable than studying the great designs themselves .
For it is in the evolution that the real wisdom lies .
The structures that result from the evolution can help you , but without knowing why they were evolved into a design , you 're more likely to misapply them or over - engineer with them on your next project .
To date , our software design literature has focused more on teaching great solutions than teaching evolutions to great solutions .
We need to change that .
As the great poet Goethe said , " That which thy fathers have bequeathed to thee , earn it anew if thou wouldst possess it . "
The refactoring literature is helping us reacquire a better understanding of good design solutions by revealing sensible evolutions to those solutions .
If we want to get the most out of patterns , we must do the same thing :
See patterns in the context of refactorings , not just as reusable elements existing apart from the refactoring literature .
This is perhaps my primary motivation for producing a catalog of refactorings to patterns .
By learning to evolve your designs , you can become a better software designer and reduce the amount of work you over - or under - engineer .
Test - first programming and merciless refactoring are the key practices of evolutionary design .
Instill refactoring to patterns in your knowledge of refactorings and you 'll find yourself even better equipped to evolve great designs .

Make of it what you will , but Arc is now officially released .
This part of Graham 's announcement is a gem :
I worry about releasing it , because I do n't want there to be forces pushing the language to stop changing .
Once you release something and people start to build stuff on top of it , you start to feel you should n't change things .
So we 're giving notice in advance that we 're going to keep acting as if we were the only users .
We 'll change stuff without thinking about what it might break , and we wo n't even keep track of the changes .
I realize that sounds harsh , but there 's a lot at stake .
I went to a talk last summer by Guido van Rossum about Python , and he seemed to have spent most of the preceding year switching from one representation of characters to another .
I never want to blow a year dealing with characters .
Why did Guido have to ?
Because he had to think about compatibility .
But though it seems benevolent to worry about breaking existing code , ultimately there 's a cost : it means you spend a year dealing with character sets instead of making the language more powerful .
This sure made me smile ...

Every so often , once every 10 or 15 years maybe , there 's a nightclub show as special as the Elvis Costello performance Thursday at the Great American Music Hall .
Maybe not even that often .
Costello has such a history with San Francisco , it 's not surprising that he came here to give this one - time - only performance of his entire first album , with most of the same musicians playing the songs in the same order as on the record 30 years ago .
" We 're turning the record over , " he said when he reached " ( The Angels Wanna Wear My ) Red Shoes , " the song that led off side 2 of his 1977 classic , " My Aim Is True . "
Costello , whose ambitious artistic agenda in recent years has cut across rock , pop , jazz and classical boundaries , does n't usually engage in such self - celebration , but he did this for a friend .
Austin de Lone is a highly regarded Mill Valley keyboard player whom Costello has known since he first came to the States .
De Lone 's son , Richard , suffers from Prader - Willi syndrome , a rare , incurable disease that leaves victims perpetually starving .
Revenue from the two sold - out shows commenced fundraising for the Richard de Lone Special Housing Project .
Not only did Costello , 53 , perform " My Aim Is True " song by song , making a strong case for the album as one of the great premieres in rock history , but he followed the 50 - minute performance of the album with another 50 minutes of songs he wrote around the same time , one unknown gem after another .
It was a daring , intimate look deep into Costello 's songwriting notebooks that will undoubtedly never be repeated .
Backing him onstage were three members of Clover , a long - defunct Marin County rock group that accompanied Costello on the original recording sessions and never played with him again .
Guitarist John McFee judiciously decorated the buoyant , chugging sound of the band .
The tightly focused songs allowed for only a couple of brief guitar breaks , but McFee , who has played with the Doobie Brothers since 1981 , tucked shimmering little accents around the end of verses throughout the show .
Keyboardist Sean Hopper , who became a founding member of Huey Lewis and the News after Clover broke up in 1978 , joined Clover bassist John Ciambotti , who worked for a time with Lucinda Williams and currently is a chiropractor in Southern California .
Pete Thomas of Costello's longtime band the Attractions replaced Clover drummer Mickey Shine , although Costello acknowledged Shine during the show .
Clover 's two vocalists were not involved in the " My Aim Is True " sessions , so the reunion also was absent Nashville songwriter Alex Call and Huey Lewis , who called himself Huey Louis when he belonged to Clover .
In between performing the " My Aim Is True " songs , Costello talked about making the album .
" It was never conceived as a record , " he said .
" It was a bunch of demos of songs for ( British guitarist ) Dave Edmunds to cover . "
He remembered spending the night in the crummy London studio where the record was made and being told to sleep with the lights turned on to keep the rats away .
He said he woke up sometime in the night with the lights off and " the sound of rustling . "
After charging through the " My Aim Is True " tunes , Costello brought out an acoustic guitar and , explaining he decided to do only songs he wrote in 1977 , played a half dozen that few in the crowd had ever heard .
He admitted to salvaging spare parts from some of these unpublished early efforts , like " Imagination " or " Blue Minute , " for later songs .
Each of the tunes would have fit comfortably on the album .
" I Don't Want to Go Home " had the bluff and bite .
" Cheap Reward " snarled properly .
With the band back behind him , McFee on pedal steel , Costello brought out the secret country and western flavor of the sessions .
" My manager used to say , ' Journalist coming on the tour bus - hide the George Jones tapes , ' " said Costello , who eventually recorded his song " Stranger in My House " with Jones .
Costello even sang a Clover song , " Mr. Moon , " from the band 's 1971 second album , " Forty - Niner . "
Costello remembered the store in London where he bought the record .
" The mystique of this area and all the music coming out of it was very great to me , " he said .
" One of the groups we mythologized most was Clover . "
It 's a tribute to Costello 's restless creativity that in only the past couple of years he has passed through town with four bands .
He played Oakland 's Paramount Theatre with the Attractions , giving a textbook lesson in rock quartet dynamics .
He returned to the Paramount with New Orleans songwriter Allen Toussaint and Toussaint 's large band .
He did last year 's Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival with a thrown - together ensemble that included dieselbilly guitarist Bill Kirchen and de Lone , who also gave a brief opening duo performance Thursday .
It was a rare and open night - as open as the songbooks on the music stands - another brilliant performance from the redoubtable Mr. Costello .
Bear managers and park wardens have tried aversive conditioning before : in Banff , for instance , they used to drive up to bears eating roadside vegetation and blast them with water cannons .
But as St. Clair points out , that kind of hazing not only violates several principles of animal learning theory ( among them , that punishment should be immediate , consistent and not signaled in advance ) ; all it ultimately teaches a bear is that , through a series of our bylaws , the only humans who will hurt it are humans in uniforms arriving in trucks between the hours of 9 and 5 .
According to St. Clair , hazing also ignores a breakthrough in animal psychology known as the Garcia Principle ( after John Garcia ’s work with rats in the 1970s ) , which suggests that , no matter how hard you try , you may never be able to get an animal to associate food with pain .
“ It makes complete sense , ” St. Clair says .
“ In terms of its survival , a bear has had no evolutionary reason to associate food with danger . ”
But what if every time a bear put its face in the trash , you sneaked up , pulled out a slingshot and hit it in the head with a marble ?
What if you considered the flipside of the Garcia Principle , which suggests that animals can learn an association between pain and sound ( which is why a bear looks up when a tree limb cracks ) , and five seconds before you whacked that bear with a marble , you blew a whistle in its face ?
Could you reach deep into its ancient evolutionary machinery and teach the bear that just the sound of a whistle was reason enough to high - tail it out of the trash ?
That , at any rate , was the hypothesis , and starting in 2005 Homstol joined with two other young biologists , Nicola Brabyn and Mary von der Porten , to see if they could , as Homstol puts it , “ restore normal wary bear behavior ” among a group of chronically unwary bears , including a small , swift - footed yearling they took to calling Oscar when he showed up at the transfer station last June .
At 100 pounds , newly on his own , Oscar was having a hard time finding food and avoiding being pushed around by bigger bears .
At the transfer station , though , he was getting in and out of Dumpsters with ease , and when Homstol , Brabyn and von der Porten took baseline measurements of his response to humans , Oscar ’s score was “ indifferent . ”
When they tried to measure his “ displacement distance ” — at what distance does a bear run and hide from an approaching human ? — they came within 10 yards of Oscar , which is the least amount of space they will put between themselves and any bear , and Oscar did n’t displace ; he did n’t even move .
“ We were wallpaper , ” Homstol says .
From the transfer station , Oscar moved into residential neighborhoods , often traveling with other young males .
( When food is abundant , Whistler ’s bears abandon territoriality and become uncharacteristically social , sometimes even leaving their dens in winter to pick up extra calories . )
Together Oscar and one of his companions lingered by condos , trying to remove screens from windows and break into garbage sheds .
When a conservation officer darted the other bear to collar him , Oscar remained within steps of the officer , trying to engage his tranquilized companion in play .
For five days , from dawn to dusk , Homstol , Brabyn and von der Porten followed Oscar everywhere , and every time they found him in circumstances they deemed “ inappropriate ” or “ conflict , ” they pulled out their slingshots and fired at him with marbles .
The five - day blitz had some effect :
At the sight of an approaching human , Oscar began to move off , sometimes at a “ lope , ” sometimes even a “ run ” ; and his displacement distance increased to 30 yards .
“ I felt like Dennis the Menace , ” says Homstol , who has a way with a slingshot .
“ But the thing worked like a charm . ”
Following the end of his five - day treatment , Oscar stayed out of trouble for about a week .
But soon thereafter , with no more dawn - to - dusk hammering , he was again hanging out in yards and on porches , checking out houses and garages .
Once , Homstol got a call regarding a familiar - sounding , small - bodied yearling who had broken into a truck , where he sat in the passenger seat as if waiting for a ride .
By the time I was in town , some five weeks later , Homstol was coming to realize that , however effective aversive conditioning might be in the short term , it may simply require too much manpower and probably wo n’t work on bears that have already progressed down the food - conditioning pathway , especially in communities that ca n’t secure their waste .
“ We just ca n’t keep up , ” she said .
“ Between the C.O. ’s and us , there are only six people trying to teach all these bears . ”
As for Oscar , whatever wariness he learned from five days of marbles seemed to be slipping away without further upkeep , and Homstol concluded that if he stayed in Whistler he ’d soon be breaking into houses and end up with a bullet in his chest .
She and the town ’s conservation officers decided to dart him , put him in a trap and — because he was young , healthy and not the worst offender they ’d ever seen — give him a one - way ticket out of town .
“ Poor Oscar , ” she said .
“ Maybe if we ’d gotten to him sooner . ”
For several days , Homstol and I went looking for the yearling in her truck .
By then , he was a well - known and easily - recognized bear , and driving through town we followed not only his radio signal but also a trail of leads from residents who called in a small bear with collar meeting Oscar ’s description .
He seemed to be everywhere at once — at this barbecue pit , at that garbage shed — but whenever Homstol arrived at the scene , Oscar had given her the slip .
I have a lot to learn .
By Friday , anyway .
I have a Pharmacology exam followed by a Pathophysiology exam this coming Monday .
Once again , I find myself behind .
It ’s the funny kind of behind where you look at the stack of notes on your desk ( 2 ″ of one , 3 ″ of the other ) and sort of chuckle .
“ Ha .
This is going to be funny . ”
Cue despair .
Looking at it now , I ’m tempted to start the passive bragging of impossible odds .
“ You have no idea how hard it is , ” I ’d say .
“ Medical school is like trying to take a drink from a fire hose , ” I ’d brag .
And that ’s total bullshit .
At the beginning of each course , we ’re given a syllabus telling us how we ’re going to be graded , the question break - down for each test , and the schedule of lectures each day for the next 4 - 5 months .
Nothing is going to sneak up on you unless you ca n’t read the print on the page ( in which case you ’re blind and things sneak up on you all the time ) .
But it ’s sunny outside or snowing outside or Tuesday .
Whatever .
You ’re in medical school to become a doctor , not to be in a classroom ( scheduling conflicts here ) and you find yourself out on the weekends , maybe catching a movie on the weekday , and so on .
You blow off the first week of any course because the material is supposed to be introductory and you certainly blow off the first week after any exam to recuperate .
Maybe you take off two weeks if it was especially difficult and draining .
Eventually though , the next exam is closer than the last exam and you have to return to the desk and pretend to be a serious student .
The first week back studying , you wo n’t be as efficient and as familiar with the material as you were leading up to the last test , so there ’s some built - in catching up to do .
You ca n’t understand the material taught TODAY because you blew off the introduction , so until you catch up , you keep falling behind .
By the time you ’re back in your stride the exam is so close you can feel it ’s breath on your neck and you still have material to cover on a first pass .
Let ’s not forget : you have n’t reviewed or committed anything to memory at this point .
It ’s now that you understand the truth :
Medical school is like trying to eat five pancakes every morning for breakfast .
You know you can do it .
A Premed advisory committee endorsed you saying , “ He has the stomach for it .
He ’s committed . ”
And you prove them all right .
Every day you show up with your first - year optimism and your annoying hunger for learning and you clean that plate ( just kidding , it ’s adorable ) .
But you begin to notice that those pancakes are slowing you down a little each day and the sugar highs and lows are screwing with your sleep .
Smart person that you are , you decide to pass on the flapjacks one day .
You think to yourself , “ Self , I ’m going to eat ten pancakes tomorrow so that I do n’t have to eat any today . ”
But it never stops .
Turns out that “ self ” is n’t the most responsible lender , and before you know it there are 40 pancakes in front of you and your plate needs to be clean by tomorrow .
So yeah , at this point it looks impossible .
But really , it ’s your fault .
In the future , as I like to imagine it , I ’ll be in charge of all medical school admissions .
The process will be six weeks long and will consist of nothing more than showing up each morning to eat five pancakes , at which point you can then go about whatever you were going to do that day .
At the end of the five weeks a few jaded , newly diabetic hopefuls will come to my office and , mixed with both pride and resignation say , “ I did it .
I finished those goddamn pancakes . ”
“ Wow , ” I ’ll say .
“ That ’s very impressive .
You must be very proud , and your parents must be very proud .
Just one more thing . ”
They ’ll reflexively clutch their stomachs , shifting their girth from one hip onto the next and groan , “ What ’s that ? ”
“ Regurgitate it . ”

Science reporter , BBC News , San Francisco
Noctilucent , or " night - shining " , clouds appear as thin bands in twilight skies , some 80 km ( 50 miles ) above the surface .
The AIM probe has now returned the first truly global pictures of these phenomena which appear to be increasing in frequency and extent .
Scientists say their observations show how the clouds alter rapidly , hour by hour and day by day .
They hope their studies will reveal the key triggers to the clouds ' formation and why these triggers appear to be undergoing long - term change .
AIM is getting the first truly global view of the unusual clouds
Earth 's highest clouds
" These are things we do n't understand and they all suggest a possible connection to global change ; and we need to understand that connection and what it means for the whole atmosphere , " he told BBC News .
Dr Russell was speaking here at the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting .
He is the principal investigator on the Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere ( AIM ) mission , a 195 kg ( 430 lb ) satellite that was launched in April of this year .
Sitting 600 km above the Earth , the spacecraft has the perfect vantage point from which to study the clouds that are also sometimes referred to as Polar Mesospheric Clouds .
They form at high latitudes during summer months in an extremely cold ( - 160C ) , dry ( 100,000 times drier than the Sahara Desert ) , and low - pressure ( 100,000 times less than at the Earth 's surface ) environment .
The changes in frequency and brightness have been observed over the past 30 years of satellite observations
They are normally apparent in summer months at high latitudes - at about 50 - 65 degrees north and south
They have been seen recently as low as 40 degrees North and have become a popular target for amateur photographers
One study implicated water in space shuttle exhaust plumes as a contributor - and AIM will be following up this theory
" We 'd never seen a picture of the whole polar region before , to see these clouds on a daily basis .
That in itself is a revelation - it shows how variable they are from day to day , from orbit to orbit , " he added .
From the AIM images , it is clear the locations where the clouds form seem to rotate around the Arctic with a period of about five days .
That rotation in longitude is also seen in the temperature data .
" The interesting thing is that the magnitude of the temperature changes is only about five degrees Fahrenheit ( 3C ) , " said Dr Scott Bailey , AIM 's deputy principal investigator from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University .
The AIM spacecraft looks over and through the clouds
AIM 's data also shows the clouds to be much brighter than was previously thought .
There are unprecedented observations , too , of the precursors to the clouds - small ice crystals just 5 - 8 nanometres ( billionths of a metre ) in size .
In addition , AIM can see structures that were thought only to occur in " normal " clouds in the lowest few kilometres in the atmosphere .
The team believes these features form and break up as a result of pressure waves coming up from below .
" There are rings in the clouds that appear quite frequently , " Professor Gary Thomas , an AIM co-investigator from the University of Colorado .
" They 're extremely variable .
In just a few minutes , these holes are gone and others can appear .
And some of these rings are huge - 300 - 400 miles across . "
Noctilucent clouds need cold temperatures , the presence of water vapour , and small dust particles around which the water can condense and freeze out to create ice crystals .
Something must be changing in this " recipe " to alter the clouds ' behaviour in recent years .
The AIM team is confident its spacecraft will take it closer to understanding the key factors in play .

Editor 's Note : Harvard Business School professor John Quelch writes a blog on marketing issues , called Marketing Know : How , for Harvard Business Online .
It is reprinted on HBS Working Knowledge .
For all the coverage of the Presidential primaries , only half of eligible voters will likely cast ballots in November .
While 20 percent of U.S. adults are political junkies , the rest can't spare the time , do n't think their vote will matter , see no important differences among the candidates , or are turned off by the electoral process and candidates ' campaign tactics .
They are the " vanishing voters " of U.S. politics .
There are 5 structural reasons why this is the case .
In U.S. general elections , voters usually see only 2 viable candidates on the ballot .
That 's one reason turnout is low .
In any other product category , there are many more choices .
As a result , consumer interest — and consumption — is higher .
In representative democracies , the consumer has to live with the majority decision .
That also dampens enthusiasm .
Not so in commerce .
You can buy or own whichever brand , or suite of brands , you wish .
In U.S. politics , citizens vote on a specified date once every 2 , 4 , or 6 years .
Maybe they have to register in advance , wait in line at the polling station , and use an out - of - date polling machine to do so .
The commercial marketplace is much more convenient .
Consumers can cast their votes at millions of points - of - purchase every day .
Some politicians understand that Branding 101 requires the development of a distinctive , appealing message , delivered consistently over time .
But politicians can't win by targeting a single niche segment .
They have to win a majority on election day , and doing so often means parsing words , trying to have it both ways , and allegedly flip - flopping on issues .
In addition , the winner - takes - all system often leads candidates to desperate tactics such as negative advertising to tear down their opponents rather than promoting their own virtues .
Citizens can be forgiven for being cynical .
A final reason for consumer indifference to politics may be the effectiveness of commercial marketing .
Most consumers have stronger relationships with brands like Starbucks ( the " third place " after home and work ) than with their elected representatives or the umbrella political brands , Democrat or Republican .
Around $ 20 per vote will be spent on political advertising in this year 's presidential campaign .
Yet there are reasons for hope .
Citizen interest in this year 's primaries is high because there is no obvious winner and genuinely different candidates are competing on both sides .
The Internet has greatly increased the opportunity for non-establishment , underfunded candidates to develop viable grass - roots campaigns .
Voter questions and candidate answers in town meetings are now the standard .
In other words , this year 's election process so far seems more open and democratic than ever .
Around $ 20 per vote will be spent on political advertising in this year 's presidential campaign .
By commercial standards , and given the importance of the purchase decision , that does n't seem high .
What 's needed in politics is not less marketing but better marketing : focusing on current and emerging customer needs , developing product and service solutions , informing interested citizens about them , and making them easily accessible .
I remember Leonard Marsh , 1 of the 3 founders of Snapple , explaining the brand 's success : " We never thought of ourselves as any better than our customers . "
Politicians need to view citizens not as occasional voters , donors , and taxpayers but as their customers .
What do you think ?

( CNN ) -- Mitt Romney claimed a much - needed victory in Tuesday 's Michigan Republican primary , making the race for the GOP presidential nomination anybody 's game .
Mitt Romney speaks to supporters after his Michigan win. more photos »
" Tonight marks the beginning of a comeback -- a comeback for America , " the former Massachusetts governor said .
" Let 's take this campaign to South Carolina and Nevada and Florida and all over the country .
Let 's take it all the way to the White House , " he said to a cheering crowd .
Some political analysts said Michigan was a must - win for Romney , who finished second in Iowa and New Hampshire .
Romney , who won the overshadowed Wyoming caucuses , is a Michigan native and his father was governor of the state in the 1960s .
Forty - one percent of people who voted in the GOP primary said Romney 's Michigan ties were important to them , according to exit polls .
Watch Romney declare victory »
With 81 percent of precincts reporting , Romney had 39 percent of the vote compared to Arizona Sen.
John McCain 's 30 percent .
Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee had 16 percent of the vote , followed by Texas Rep. Ron Paul with 6 percent .
Former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson had 4 percent , and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani trailed with 3 percent .
Despite receiving little support from Michigan , Giuliani was happy , according to Steve Forbes , the national co-chair of the Giuliani campaign .
Giuliani has largely skipped the early voting states and devoted his resources to Florida and the delegate - rich " Super Tuesday " states that hold primaries February 5 .
" I think the McCain defeat tonight simply underscores how volatile this race is -- how fluid it is , and also underscores how wise Rudy Giuliani was to focus on Florida .
We 're going to do very well [ in Florida ] .
That means he 'll do well on February 5 , and that means we 're going to get the nomination , " Forbes said .
Check out the CNN analysis of the results »
Huckabee congratulated Romney after his win , but pledged to take South Carolina 's January 19 Republican primary .
Watch Huckabee say he's not disappointed »
" It looks like I won Iowa .
John McCain won New Hampshire .
Mitt Romney won Michigan .
But ladies and gentleman , we 're going to win South Carolina , " Huckabee said .
McCain , who won Michigan in 2000 , told his supporters he " did n't mind a fight . "
" We 're ready for the challenge ahead , " he said .
" We fell a little short tonight , but we have no cause to be discouraged . "
Watch McCain congratulate Romney »
On the Democratic side , CNN projected that Sen. Hillary Clinton would win Michigan .
See scenes from Michigan 's primary »
The New York senator was the only front - runner on the ballot .
Party officials voted to strip Michigan of its Democratic delegates for its decision to schedule the primary so early .
In a show of solidarity with the party , the top- tier Democratic presidential candidates , except for Clinton , asked that their names be removed from the ballot .
But some Democratic leaders in the state urged supporters of Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois and former North Carolina Sen .
John Edwards , Clinton 's closest rivals , to vote " uncommitted " in the primary .
Under state law , their supporters cannot cast write - in votes for them .
But if at least 15 percent of the voters in a congressional district opt for " uncommitted , " delegates not bound to any candidate could attend the national convention .
That could allow Edwards or Obama supporters to play a role in candidate selection -- if the national party changes its mind and decides to count Michigan 's delegates .
With 81 percent of precincts reporting , Clinton had 57 percent of the vote and 38 percent of Democratic primary voters had selected " uncommitted . "
Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich received 4 percent of the vote .
In 2008 , more than in recent campaigns , the delegate count may prove important .
Narrow losses -- which still add to a candidate 's delegate total -- could keep more than one hopeful in contention .
" For the first time since 1988 , this is a delegate race , " Clinton aide Howard Wolfson said last week .
Romney was expected to win at least 12 Michigan GOP delegates , according to CNN estimates .
McCain was expected to win at least 9 .
Nine of 30 delegates had not yet been allocated .
Most of Michigan 's Republican voters had the same thing on their mind -- the economy , according to exit polling .
A majority of Michigan Republican primary voters -- 55 percent -- said the economy is the most pressing issue facing the nation .
That compares to 18 percent who said Iraq , 14 percent who named illegal immigration , and 10 percent who pointed to terrorism .
Michigan has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country -- 7.4 percent , compared with 5 percent nationally -- and the top- tier Republicans vowed to make the revival of Michigan 's economy a priority .
The next contests come Saturday , when the Democrats face off in Nevada and the Republicans fight for South Carolina .
The wide - open GOP race is a sign of ongoing dissatisfaction with the Republican electorate , according to Ari Fleischer , former press secretary for President Bush .
" I think South Carolina will be inconclusive .
It 's not going to be what it used to be because it 's too much of a jumble .
Florida will be a vital springboard to February 5 , " Fleischer said .

All About Michigan • U.S. Presidential Election
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Congress moved closer on Wednesday to slashing lead content in toys and devoting more government resources to product safety regulation , but final action was not expected until next year .
Democratic presidential candidate U.S. Senator Barack Obama ( D - IL ) ( R ) sorts toys collected by his campaign and donated to Toys for Tots in Londonderry , New Hampshire December 19,2007 .
REUTERS / Brian Snyder
After a surge of recalls of lead - tainted toys , many of them made in China , the House of Representatives voted 407 - 0 for a bill that would nearly eliminate lead in toys and boost funding for the Consumer Product Safety Commission ( CPSC ) .
“ This legislation represents a quantum leap forward in strengthening the Consumer Product Safety Commission ’s watchdog role on behalf of American consumers , ” said Illinois Democratic Rep. Bobby Rush , a key backer of the House legislation .
A similar bill is moving through the Senate , but congressional aides said negotiations over language were still under way and a floor vote would not come until next year .
In the interim , Illinois Democratic Sen . Richard Durbin said that a 2008 budget bill passed by the Senate on Tuesday included a nearly 30 - percent CPSC budget increase , the largest increase in more than 30 years .
With bipartisan support for broader reform and future funding increases , however , lawmakers said they were confident that a House - Senate compromise could be reached soon and a final bill sent to President George W. Bush for consideration .
“ Something very close to this bill will be on the president ’s desk .
We will have a bill - signing ceremony in the Rose Garden sometime later in this Congress , ” said Texas Republican Rep. Joe Barton in House floor remarks .
“ This bill has the toughest lead standards in the world for children ’s products , ” Barton said .
Consumer product safety grabbed the public spotlight and Congress ’ attention earlier this year amid scores of recalls of products by Mattel Inc , RC2 Corp and other companies due to excessive lead content and other hazards .
The ensuing uproar led House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and a few other lawmakers to call for the ouster of CPSC Acting Chairman Nancy Nord .
But she refused to quit , while Congress stepped up efforts to reform the agency and tackle the lead problem .
Nord thanked the House for passing its bill and urged the Senate to “ follow the House ’s lead in passing bipartisan and sensible product safety legislation . ”
The House ’s bill would require a gradual reduction of lead content in children ’s products , with the limit going down to 100 parts per million effective four years after enactment .
It would also require manufacturers to include tracking labels on products to speed recalls of toys for children aged 12 and younger , while mandating independent safety testing of toys by labs accredited by the CPSC .
The National Association of Manufacturers , an industry group , called the House bill “ strong , bipartisan legislation to give the CPSC resources it needs to carry out its duties . ”
The CPSC back in the 1980s had a staff of 1,000 .
Today , it has 420 people and only a tiny toy - testing office .
The bill would steadily increase the CPSC ’s budget to $ 100 million by fiscal 2011 .
Plus , it would raise penalties for failing to cooperate with the CPSC to $ 10 million from the current $ 1.25 million , while giving the beleaguered agency $ 20 million to modernize its toy - testing laboratory .
Nord is one of only two commissioners now serving on the CPSC , which was created in the 1970s to regulate hazards in about 15,000 different consumer products .
The House bill would restore the CPSC to its full complement of five commissioners .
Consumers Union and other public interest activist groups praised the House vote .
“ The issue now moves to the Senate , ” they said in a statement .
“ We hope to work with both the House and the Senate to get a strong final CPSC reform bill to the president as soon next year as possible . ”

“ The situation is very tense , ” Mayor David J. Berger said .
“ Serious threats have been made .
People are starting to carry weapons to protect themselves . ”
Surrounded by farm country known for its German Catholic roots and conservative politics , Lima is the only city in the immediate area with a significant African - American population .
Black families , including Mr. Manley ’s , came to Lima in the 1940s and ’ 50s for jobs at what is now the Husky Energy Lima Refinery and other factories along the city ’s southern border .
Blacks make up 27 percent of the city ’s 38,000 people , Mr. Berger said .
Many blacks still live downwind from the refinery .
Many whites on the police force commute from nearby farm towns , where a black face is about as common as a twisty road .
Of Lima ’s 77 police officers , two are African - American .
“ If I have any frustration when I retire , it ’ll be that I was n’t able to bring more racial balance to the police force , ” said Chief Garlock , who joined the force in 1971 and has been chief for 11 years .
Tarika Wilson had six children , ages 8 to 1 .
They were fathered by five men , all of whom dealt drugs , said Darla Jennings , Ms. Wilson ’s mother .
But Ms. Wilson never took drugs nor allowed them to be sold from her house , said Tania Wilson , her sister .
“ She took great care of those kids , without much help from the fathers , and the community respected her for that , ” said Ms. Wilson ’s uncle , John Austin .
Image Residents of Lima , Ohio , posted a sign at the house where Ms. Wilson , 26 , was killed and her 14 - month - old son was injured .

Tarika Wilson ’s companion , Mr. Terry , was the subject of a long - term drug investigation , Chief Garlock said , but Ms. Wilson was never a suspect .
I ’ve got a treat for you readers today !
A friend of mine was lucky enough to attend the last Comicon in San Diego and she was nice enough to write a little summary of it to post on the site .
I ’m green with envy –the pictures make me really wish I could ’ve been there .
Maybe I ’ll have the time and the money when the next one comes around .
I certainly plan on trying to get into TGS as soon as finances permit .
Major conventions like that are a goldmine of cool stuff no one knows about yet .
Without further ado , here is what Jada had to say about her experience this years Comicon ;
An otaku-tastic experience !
To say the least , my first convention experience has left me with nothing but fond memories and a life long passion .
The first night was Preview Night , which basically gives you time to get your bearings and understanding of the massive building layout as well as spend tons of money in the exhibition hall .
The exhibition hall was a world all on its own ; filled with almost everything I could think of to satisfy my fan girl desires .
The next four days of the convention were completely action packed and exhilarating , and it all depends on how you plan them to be .
For my trip , there were several points of extreme interest in the 2007 convention .
A slight few examples include : - Milla Jovovich appearing in person for the Resident Evil : Extinction panel .
- Avatar the Last Airbender panel with Bryan Konietzko and Dee Bradley Baker appearing in person .
- The Square Enix merchandise stand .
( It was massive . )
- The Artistsâ€ ™ Alley where you could find many of your personal favorite artists and get a one - of - a - kind sketch that will leave friends jealous forever more .
A few might complain that the lineups are out of hand , but this too I found to be an adrenaline high all on its own .
With conversational skills you can easily find that the majority of the people in line with you are potentially best friends with identical or at the least , very similar interests .
Another high point of the convention was the mass amounts of cosplay ( good and bad ) everywhere you turned .
I found myself hauling loads of pictures back to my laptop at the end of each day .
I am very much anticipating the 2008 convention and plan to try my best and go every year .
All together it was absolutely thrilling and my only advice still stands as , â€œpack light and bring many suitcases !â€ 
She sent along a few pictures to include with the post that I ’ve got here for you .
I love the Lego Batman and the Darth Vader helmet contest .
The controversy came with the first daffodils in March , shortly after Peter Singer , the father of the animal rights movement , reviewed a reissue of the book '' Dearest Pet : On Bestiality ' ' ( Verso ) , by the Dutch biologist Midas Dekkers , for Nerve , an online sex magazine .
Three months have passed and still the sun has not set on the latest tempest surrounding Mr. Singer , the provocative author of '' Animal Liberation ' ' and a professor of bioethics at Princeton University 's Center for Human Values .
Mr. Singer has received his share of human venom before this .
Protesters have called him a Nazi for his view that in some cases infanticide and euthanasia are morally justifiable .
The furor this time concerns sex with animals .
In his review , titled '' Heavy Petting , '' Mr. Singer noted that almost all of the taboos on nonprocreative sex ( taboos against homosexuality , oral sex , contraception and masturbation ) have vanished .
But one notable exception still stands : the taboo on sex with animals .
'' Heard anyone chatting at parties lately about how good it is having sex with their dog ? '' he asked .
The persistence of the bestiality taboo , he wrote , reflects humans ' ambivalence about animals .
We know we are like them , but we think we are better , and so we want '' to differentiate ourselves , erotically and in every other way , from animals . ''
Of course , the taboo does not prevent fantasies .
Mr. Singer described the illustrations in Mr. Dekkers ' book , including ''a 17th - century Indian miniature of a deer mounting a woman ' ' and a 19th - century Japanese drawing of a very busy giant octopus groping a woman .
Nor is the taboo always effective in real life .
Mr. Singer noted that some men have sex with hens , and certain people do n't stop the family dog from making free with them , which occasionally leads to '' mutually satisfying activities . ''
The kittens climb all over Summer the rabbit Six abandoned kittens have found an unexpected new mother figure - a pet rabbit .
Veterinary nurse Melanie Humble took the three - week - old kittens to her Aberdeen home .
The kittens seemed to think Summer the rabbit was their mother and began to climb all over her and try to feed from her .
Efforts will be made to find the four males and two females permanent homes in the coming weeks .
Melanie , 29 , told the BBC Scotland news website : " The abandoned kittens were handed in when they were about three weeks old and I took them home .
" Summer the rabbit was taken inside on Bonfire Night because of the fireworks and the kittens seemed to really like her and thought she was their mother . "
' She 's gigantic '
She added : " They were trying to get milk from her and climbing over her .
And Summer was not bothered by them at all .
" Summer is five months old and she 's gigantic .
It is lovely to see them all together .
" They are all doing well and Cats Protection will re-home them . "

What are these ?
What to make of Ron Paul , the internet 's poster boy for the presidency ?
The Texas Republican , whose campaign traction seems confined almost entirely to the internet , is lagging after Iowa and New Hampshire .
While he's no threat to win the GOP nomination , let alone the White House , the phenomenon of his online popularity bears scrutiny .
For some of us who look more than 20 feet beyond our noses , it ’s troubling .
If the internet has the power to legitimize the national candidacy of someone as extreme as Ron Paul , then maybe it should be regulated .
( Kidding .
Just kidding . )
It 's not hard to understand Paul 's appeal to the internet cognoscenti .
He 's a libertarian ( to use the word in its simplest form ) , and if any political philosophy can be said to broadly appeal to inveterate online devotees , that 's the one .
And he brings impeccable libertarian credentials to the table , which manifest themselves in some very beguiling ways .
To wit :
He opposed the Patriot Act , breaking ranks with his own party to do so .
He voted against the imposition of a national ID card .
He 's on record opposing the National Security Agency 's domestic - spying program .
He favors lifting the embargo against Cuba .
( I threw that one in for me , not you . )
This is catnip for many of you , I know .
For me , too , actually .
( Politics does make strange bedfellows , eh , comrades ? )
He almost sounds rational .
But he 's not .
Like all absolutists – and make no mistake , libertarianism is absolutism as surely as atheism is faith – Paul is ill suited for this particular job .
He 's running for president of the United States , remember , not for a seat in some gerrymandered Texas congressional district .
If elected , he would be leading the most powerful nation on earth , one whose every action has repercussions in every corner of the world .
We ’ve already seen what happens when that trust is placed in the hands of the incompetent .
You can't be a good president in the 21st century when your chief concerns are the sovereignty of the American taxpayer and his right to bear arms .
It ’s too insular .
Isolationism is no longer an option , and has n't been for years .
The world is too small and you can thank , or blame , technology for that reality .
The stakes are far too high , as we 've learned since Sept. 11 , 2001 , to act like we can do anything we damned well please anytime we damned well feel like it .
And this guy wants to pull us out of the United Nations .
Terrific .
The United States as rogue elephant .
What a splendid idea .
Applaud Paul for championing your privacy rights if you will , but consider some of his other views , well documented , before throwing the baby out with the bathwater .
Speaking of babies , his libertarian defense of individual rights does n't extend to women , apparently .
Paul , an obstetrician in another life , opposes abortion .
More specifically , he supports a state ’s right to ban abortion .
In other words , he does n’t want Washington telling you that you can’t have an abortion , but if Montgomery , Austin , Salem or Richmond say you can ’t , that ’s OK .
He also equivocates on stem cell research , supporting it " generically " but again fobbing it off as a states - rights issue ( like the old Confederacy , states rights is a major plank in the Paul platform ) .
His chief concern is n't so much the morality of the research as who pays for it .
That 's a new one on me : turning the stem cell debate into a taxpayer - rights issue .
But there ’s more .
Domestically , a Paul administration would be so extreme in the defense of individual property rights as to make the Reagan years look like socialism .
Paul says the federal government has helped damage the environment by “ facilitating polluters , subsidizing logging in the national forests and instituting one - size - fits - all approaches that too often discriminate against those they are intended to help . ”
He ’s right in the sense that the Bush environmental record is abysmal , but Paul ’s solution – let the private landowner protect his own land – is naiveté bordering on sheer lunacy .
If Chauncey Moneybags owns 40,000 acres up near the Idaho - Montana border and decides to cash in by letting the timber boys do a little clear - cutting , who ’s going to stop him ?
Paul says Chauncey can do whatever he wants to with his land .
How is that helping the natural environment ?
( I ’m assuming here that ’s the environment Paul refers to . )
There are 300 million of us now , not 30 million , and we ca n’t all go running around unsupervised .
This is where libertarian ideals get a little unwieldy .
Besides , we ’re not all John Waynes , saddled up and gazing with flinty eyes across the prairie .
Some of us can barely cope .
Sometimes , Ron , them dad - gum polecats in Washington jest have to step in and take charge .
Dang it all .
And the foreign policy of a Paul administration ?
Replace the eagle with an ostrich and you 'll have some idea .
Paul says he ’s for free trade and he wants “ to be friends , ” but rejects the idea of the United States being part of any convention that subjects us to international law or restraint .
He likens the United Nations to a modern - day Simon Legree – that 's my hyperbole , not his – straddling Lady Liberty with a bullwhip and coldly , gleefully , stripping her bare .
The U.N. has been the bogeyman for American conservatives since the end of World War II because of its internationalist mandate .
The right has never accepted that a U.N. vote contrary to the wishes of the United States does not translate to anti-Americanism .
If there is anti-American sentiment along the East River these days , it 's because we 're swaggering around like the high school bully , and we 've pissed a lot of people off .
As for military matters , Paul ’s objection to the U.S. invasion of Iraq was not that we ignored world opinion and attacked unilaterally , but that we violated the Washingtonian - Jeffersonian doctrine of “ avoiding foreign entanglements . ”
Iraq was deliberate aggression , a crime , but here ’s a news bulletin just in for strict constitutionalists like Paul : George Washington and Thomas Jefferson have been dead for two centuries .
Our world is just ever so slightly different from the one they knew .
Realities have changed .
If Virginia Sen .
Tom Jefferson were roaming the halls of Congress today , he 'd probably be a Democrat .
Hell , he might not even own any slaves .
But this is the consciousness that Ron Paul would bring to the arena of international relations , the consciousness of 1796 .
The modern world is all about interaction , interdependence and active engagement , not isolationism .
Sorry , Ron .
I miss candlelight and hoop skirts , too , but you ca n’t go back .
Anyway , those two big oceans that used to insulate us from all that foreign chicanery have shrunk to the size of Walden Pond .
Half my e-mail comes from “ out there , ” where people talk funny .
We drink French wine , drive German and Japanese cars , and talk to our service reps in Bangalore , India .
The guys making shepherd ’s pie at the Irish pub down the street are from Central America , and all the meter maids in this town are Chinese .
Avoid foreign entanglements ?
Who ’s kidding whom here ?
If we avoid foreign entanglements what do we plan on doing for an economy ?
Who are we going to offshore all our jobs to ?
I ’ve been called a utopian and a fool and worse for my own humanistic philosophy , which , like libertarianism , preaches the value of a single human being ( but in the the more rational context of one being part of the whole ) .
Fine .
I ’m a fool .
But when push comes to shove , I ’d rather be my kind of fool than yours .
May the best candidate win .
Oh , wait .
I do n’t have one .

$ 70 Low Cost Menu for 4 to 6
My $ 45 menu has been so popular that I ’ve taken a shot at another one .
I tried to duplicate the $ 45 price tag , but it was just too hard .
Instead I ’ve developed a relatively low cost menu .

As with all of my recipes , I include plenty of milk for growing children and pregnant or nursing mothers .
Orange Juice is served every morning but Thursday .
On that day there are 2 other fruits served in addition to raw cabbage which is very rich in Vitamin C .
The menu assumes 1 /2 - cup of orange juice for each person every day that it is served .

Claim : Tapping the side of a soda can will prevent its contents from foaming over when you open it .
Status : False .
Origins :
Our desire to exert mastery over seemingly bad - intentioned inanimate objects fuels belief in the oddest things .
A shaken soda can will spew foam at us when it ’s opened , so we ’re quick to embrace a bit of “ secret knowledge ” that promises to put us back in charge of things and keep the lurking menace of frothing soda at bay .
Unfortunately ,
science does n’t work under the principle that if you wish for something strongly enough it will come true — what works in theory does n’t always work so well in practice .
The fizz gets into carbonated drinks through a process involving the forcing of carbon dioxide and water together under pressure .
An unopened can of pop is almost bubble - free because the high pressure maintained inside the container forces the carbon dioxide to stay incorporated in the liquid around it .
When you open the can , you reduce the pressure — bubbles of gas quickly form in the liquid , grow , and rise to the surface , where the carbon dioxide is released into the surrounding air .
Shaking a can of soda will a create a zillion little bubbles as the agitation unbinds the carbonation from the solution ; the more bubbles there are , the more carbon dioxide is looking to break loose at the first opportunity .
Thus , when you open a just - shaken can , it ’s foam city .
Tapping the can will not scare the carbon dioxide into staying inside , nor will it frighten the bubbles into collapsing back into the solution .
Some people advocate the theory that the tapping process looses collected bubbles from wherever they ’ve adhered to the inside of the can and causes them to rise to the top of the solution , thereby lessening the amount of “ stuff ” they expel when the can is opened .
However , tapping does nothing to reincorporate the carbon dioxide into the solution , the key element to preventing the dread foam - out .
While tapping a can may reduce the amount of spew somewhat , in practice in does n’t generally prevent the soda from foaming over when the can is opened ( and much of the reduction in spew is likely attributable to the extra time the tapping process provides for the carbon dioxide to be reabsorbed into the soda ) .
Results will vary depending upon the type of soda used , the level of agitation the can is put through , and the time taken up by the tapping / waiting process , so we tried a variety of experiments and chose one as a representative example .
In this trial , we used cans of cream soda , shook each one vigorously for ten seconds , and then tried opening them : 1 ) immediately 2 ) after ten seconds had elapsed ( without our doing anything more to the can ) and 3 ) after tapping the sides of the can briskly for ten seconds .
We repeated this trial three times , obtaining the same results each time :
Still photographs do n’t do justice to the results , but in the first case foam shot into the air and ran down the sides of the can ; in the second case foam did n’t spurt into the air but did overflow the top and run down the sides of the can ; and in the third case slightly less foam overflowed the top and ran down the sides of the can than in the second case .
The bottom line is that if you do n’t want soda to spew out at you , let the can sit unopened for a while after it ’s been shaken .
Time heals most things , especially when one of those things is delinquent carbonation just itching to have at you .
Also , a chilled can of soda generally wo n’t foam nearly as much as an unchilled one .
On the flip side of that coin , a warm soda that ’s been given a good shaking makes for a suitable peace offering when the warred - with party is a pesky little brother .

Despite persistent rumors of MacBook Pro updates , we 've yet to see the rumored Penryn , Multi - touch trackpad MacBook Pro revisions .
However , there appears to be ongoing evidence that the MacBook Pro updates are imminent .
The current MacBook Pros which were released in June carry a system identifier label of " MacBookPro3, 1 " .
One reader notes that an application called MiniBattery Logger provides public battery tracking logs , and recently revealed an entry with an identifier of " MacBookPro4, 1 " .
" MacBookPro4, 1 " is presumably the identifier for the unreleased MacBook Pro revisions .
The author of the application states that the identifier is obtained automatically from the system , though there are no guarantees that it was n't faked .
However , this same new " MacBook Pro4, 1 " identifier has also been found in the latest developer seeds of Mac OS X 10.5.2 from Apple .
In contrast , the public version of Mac OS X 10.5.1 does not contain the " 4,1 " identifier .
In many ways , all this does is verify what we have presumed to be true ... that MacBook Pro revisions are coming , and soon enough that the Mac OS X 10.5.2 will support them , but it 's still somewhat reassuring for those waiting patiently for the new MacBook Pros .
Update :
We 've received confirmation that the battery log information came from an Apple IP address , so it is believed to be authentic .
As the Supreme Court deliberates on the most recent Guantanamo Bay cases and whether detainees can be denied of access to a real court , the Washington Post is reporting that American officials held a teenager for years despite their knowledge that he was innocent .
Indeed , only months area the U.S. seized Murat Kurnaz in Pakistan , it concluded that he was not guilty .
However , he sat for four more years in Cuba .
A German intelligence officer confirmed in a memo months after his capture that “ USA considers Murat Kurnaz ’s innocence to be proven , . . .
He is to be released in approximately six to eight weeks . ”
Instead he was declared dangerous by two of the Bush Administration ’s military tribunals , which have been ridiculed internationally as sham proceedings .
It is a case that reaffirms the need and value of access to true courts .
If he had been brought before a real judge in a real legal proceeding , Kurnaz could have been released not long after his capture .
Yet , the Administration in the current Supreme Court cases insists that President Bush can deny any such access to the courts .
Unlike the prior two cases where the Court ruled against the Administration , President Bush is now able to claim congressional authority under a bill secured at the end of the last Congress .
The consolidated cases , Boumediene v. Bush and Al Odah v. United States , Nos. 06-1195 and 06-1196 , were heard in oral argument this week .
In 2002 Lakhdar Boumediene and five other Algerian natives were seized in Bosnia .
The President is using the Military Commissions Act of 2006 ( MCA ) , which eliminates federal courts ’ jurisdiction to hear pending habeas applications from detainees who have been designated .
In oral arguments , Justice Breyer asked a question about the failure of the act to offer a reasonable alternative to habeas in an exchange that fit the Kurnaz case ( as well as those before the Court ) :
BREYER : “ I ’m from Bosnia .
I ’ve been here six years .
The Constitution of the United States does not give anyone the right to hold me six years in Guantanamo without either charging me or releasing me . ”
The MCA provides for federal court review on the limited question of whether the CSRTs followed their own made - up procedures , and not on the big important matters of , er , you have the wrong guy .
CLEMENT : “ I ’m not sure he can make that argument . ”
BREYER : “ Exactly ! ” . . .
If he cannot make that argument , how does this become an equivalent to habeas ? ”
Once again , many democrats are fuming about the failure of the democratic senators to filibuster the legislation , which is a fundamental denial of American values .
Instead , as in other areas , the democrats either supported the legislation or publicly opposed without using their ability to stop it .
Now , we are again being held up to international rebuke for our double standards .
In the meantime , cases like Kurnaz demonstrate the value of judicial review to prevent abuses .
With Sam Alito on the Court , this will be close .
It will come down to Kennedy .
What is curious is that the case was originally denied but then , in a rare act , the Court reversed the decision and accepted the case .

PORT WASHINGTON , N.Y. ( MarketWatch ) --
Unanswered in the growing debate over the need for monetary and fiscal stimulus is the question can conventional remedies cure an unconventional economic problem ?
In the past , when the U.S. economy ran into trouble , there were tried and true remedies that policymakers could implement in order to turn things around .
The Federal Reserve would swing into action by cutting interest rates and injecting additional liquidity into the banking system .
Then , with a lag traceable only to the normal workings of the political process , the Congress and the president would join in by cutting taxes and increasing government spending .
And on those rare occasions when this softness would occur in a year divisible by four ( a presidential election year ) , the political process would miraculously go into overdrive , since it became a question of saving one 's own political skin as well .
However , this is not your father 's recession , thus what worked in his day may not work this time around .
Yes , fans , this time it really is different .
First you have the housing crisis .
While housing has led us into and out of recessions many times before , it 's going to take more than monetary or fiscal ease to get us out of today 's jam .
There is an oversupply of houses that , nationwide , would take almost a year to work off at current sales rates .
And that 's assuming both supplies and sales hold steady .
But supplies are rising even as homebuilding is falling because of growing foreclosures .
Meanwhile , sales are declining because prices are still too high while lending standards have tightened dramatically .
Lower interest rates will not be of much help .
For one thing , they wo n't prevent many mortgage loans from resetting to higher rates .
For another , as noted above , banks are reluctant to lend while many borrowers do n't want to ( or can 't ) borrow .
Freezing or otherwise modifying rates on loans in jeopardy is bad policy for three reasons :
(1) It would not be fair to those who were more careful when they bought their home .
(2) It will create a moral hazard -- the notion that the government stands ready to bail people out of bad decisions .
(3) It will set a precedent of government intervention changing the rules of the game for investors , since many of these mortgages have been turned into securities , as everyone knows by now .
On the fiscal side , spending increases need to be targeted at the unemployed by boosting jobless benefits , otherwise they wo n't be of much help , near term .
For their part , tax cuts will have limited effects as well : unless they are structured to encourage more spending immediately , they will simply go toward paying down debts and / or replenishing depleted savings accounts .
Let us not forget some fundamental principles as well :
1. Inflation is first and foremost a monetary phenomenon , and by easing money the Fed is laying the groundwork for a pickup in the already rapid pace of price increases later on .
2 . Tax cuts and spending increases mean Washington must borrow more .
If it borrows from the financial markets , it will push interest rates higher .
If it borrows from the Fed , the money supply will grow faster .
At any rate , for these remedies to cure what ails us , housing prices need to fall to their equilibrium level .
As I said on Dec. 3 and Dec. 17 , this means a drop of at least 25 % .
See Dec. 17 column here .
See Dec. 3 column here .
The quicker home prices fall , the sooner the housing market will stabilize , the faster holders of mortgage - backed securities will be able to judge their worth , thus triggering renewed bank lending , and the sooner the economy can get back on its feet .

There I stood at the pharmacy counter , with a head cold , sniffing away , and begging for some product that contains pseudoephedrine , which works like a magic nose unclogger .
The stuff you can get off the shelf now contains the similar - sounding drug called phenylephrine , but it might as well be a placebo .
It just does n't work , and most everyone knows this .
You can still get the good old stuff from the pharmacist but you will be suspected for this grave action .
The government , you see , says that people have been buying the old stuff and turning it into methamphetamine .
This is why Congress and the administration passed the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic
Act of 2005 , which rations the amount you can buy and requires that you prove your identity and sign a special form .
And , yes , this act is now part of the monstrosity called the Patriot Act .
I went over this whole subject last year , but this year , I really began to smell a rat , about which more below .
" Thanks Bush " I muttered as I signed the form under the glare of the pharmacist who has been trained to treat me like a possible criminal .
It 's remarkable really .
Two years ago , buying Mucinex was no different from buying toothpaste or shampoo .
Today , it is a big deal and you get on some government list as possible suspects .
And yes , they do arrest people for buying too much , as the stuffy - nosed William Fousee of New York found out earlier this year .
The data that demonstrate a national crisis of meth usage seems pretty darn thin to me , with reports of increased workplace positive tests balanced by reports of decreased usage among the young .
In any case , one has to wonder about a national law that would so dramatically affect the health of millions in order to stop some guy from making meth in his basement .
In the name of saving us from ourselves , the government has made it far more difficult for us to stay feeling healthy .
Laws are passed for a reason .
If not health , what possible motivation could the government have had for imposing this law ?
Possibly to create a national database of the stuffy nosed ?
Not likely .
Let 's follow the money a bit .
It seems that most all pseudoephedrine is manufactured in China and India , and very cheaply , much more cheaply than it can be made in the United States or Europe .
What that means is that these companies do n't have lobbyists in Washington who can make an effective case for their product .
Contrast this was phenylephrine , the world 's largest manufacturer of which is located in Germany .
The company is called Boehringer - Ingelheim , according to MSNBC .
It developed the drug in 1949 for use in eyedrops .
In the last two years , virtually every manufacturer of cold medicine has changed its formula to include the Boehringer drug .
Some continue to make the old formula available but only with special access .
Is it possible that the move against wonderful pseudoephedrine and in favor of useless phenylephrine was really a form of protectionism in disguise ?
That it was really about rewarding a well - connected company at the expense of companies without connections ?
If that sounds cynical , take a look at this .
It seems that our friends at Boehringer Ingelheim are rather interested in American politics , with 73 % of its donations going to Republican candidates for federal office .
You can see here that Boehringer even has a PAC located in Ridgefield , Connecticut .
Someone with more time than I have ought to check to see how the people it supported for Congress voted on the act that resulted in a massive shift toward their product , and has nearly kept its competitive product off the market .
Oh and look here .
It turns out that this company spent $ 1.85 million on lobbying in 2005 , and this was a huge upsurge over all previous years .
The following year it spent $ 922,000 , and it decline in 2007 .
And here is the Boehringer 2006 annual report , which triumphantly announces that " the phenylephrine business continued growing at a high level . "
( Their 2007 report is not yet online . )
Now , before you call me a crazed conspiracy theorist , consider this amazing coincidence .
The main company that stands to benefit from a law — passed in the name of the patriotic war on drugs — that effectively marginalizes in main competition and gives a boost to its inferior product spent millions in lobbying and campaign donations in the very year that the law was passed .
There is no record of any substantial spending before the push for the law began , and spending has been declining since the law passed .
So let me go out on a limb here and say what any reasonable person would strongly suspect .
The reason you can't get Mucinex and Sudafed that work without jumping through hoops is n't really about stopping basement meth users .
It is really about the racket going on in Washington in which the law is used to benefit influential producers in cahoots with the political class at the expense of less influential producers and the American people , who should have the freedom to choose .
Remember : there is a story like this behind just about everything government does .
If you comprehend that , you can understand why people like Albert Jay Nock said that the state is always and everywhere the enemy .
Researchers at the University of Alberta have shown that Viagra , the popular drug prescribed for erectile dysfunction , can improve heart function and potentially save the lives of people with specific heart problems .
Viagra 's unexpected benefit has led the U of A researchers to encourage doctors to consider the drug when a patient has a failing right ventricle of the heart , a dire condition for which there are currently no treatments available .
The research will appear next week in Circulation , a journal of the American Heart Association .
" There are a number of medical conditions in both children and adults for which there is a need to boost the performance of the right ventricle , and this drug can be clinically and immediately relevant to help these patients , " said Dr. Jayan Nagendran , a cardiac surgery resident at the U of A and the first author of the paper .
“ Sometimes the right ventricle can fail rapidly and even result in death , like in lung transplant surgery , for example .
In such a case , Viagra may increase the right ventricle 's performance and save the patient . "
Nagendran added .
" We have a number of drugs and therapies available to treat the left ventricle of the heart to prevent it from failing or to treat it after it has failed , but we do n't have anything for the right ventricle .
The phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors , which include Viagra , Cialis and Levitra , may offer some important benefits in this case , " said Dr. Evangelos Michelakis , a U of A cardiologist , the Canada Research Chair in Pulmonary Hypertension and the senior author of the paper .
In a healthy person , phosphodiesterase type 5 constricts arteries in two places in the body — the lungs and the penis .
In the lungs , it prevents excessively low blood pressure .
In the penis , it prevents excessive engorgement .
However , undue phosphodiesterase type 5 can constrict these arteries too much and cause problems , as it does in the case of pulmonary hypertension , where lung arteries constrict and put a strain on the right ventricle of the heart .
Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors allow the arteries to relax so that blood can flow more easily .
In 2002 , a U of A research team led by Michelakis published the first evidence that Viagra may improve pulmonary hypertension in humans .
This work was later conformed by larger trials and Viagra — sold under the name Revatio — is now approved all over the world for pulmonary hypertension .
Researchers assumed Viagra 's benefit in pulmonary hypertension is restricted to its ability to relax the lung arteries .
In fact , there was evidence phosphodiesterase type 5 was not expressed in the normal ventricles , explaining the lack of Viagra effects on the normal heart .
However , the U of A researchers , acting on a hunch , studied human hearts and showed that phosphodiesterase type 5 is expressed in large amounts in thickened ( hypertrophied ) right ventricles , but not in healthy hearts .
They replicated their results in animal models and also showed that Viagra enhanced the output of hypertrophied right ventricles .
Michelakis noted that this might be the first example of a drug that can improve the function of the right ventricle ( which is diseased in pulmonary hypertension ) , without affecting the left ventricle ( which is normal in pulmonary hypertension ) .
" This selectivity is important and has direct clinical implications , " Michelakis added .
" Relaxing the lung arteries alone may not be sufficient to help the patient , if the right ventricle is too weak to push blood through them .
A drug such as Viagra , with a combined beneficial effect both in the lung arteries and the right ventricle of the heart , offers a significant advantage . "
" Viagra is a drug that millions of people take every year , and we 've just learned something new and essential about how it works , " Nagendran said .
Michelakis agreed , adding , " This drug can have an immediate and direct clinical application , so we 're pretty excited about these findings . "

1. Smallpox
Triumph : The Eradication of Smallpox .
A global campaign led by D.A. Henderson of the CDC ( then the Communicable Disease Center ) tracks smallpox down to its last redoubts in south Asia and Africa .
The last case of wild smallpox is reported in 1975 , when Ali Mao Maalin , a Somali vaccine worker , becomes ill with a mild form of the disease ( he survives ) .
( Chapter 6 , “ Fighting Measles , Remodeling Society ” )
The eradication of smallpox has a long history .
In 1721 , the Congregationalist minister Cotton Mather of Boston introduces variolation , in which a bit of fluid from a smallpox boil is scratched into a patient ’s skin , infecting him or her with a generally milder form of the disease .
( Chapter 1 ; “ Experimenting on the Neighbors ” ) .
In 1798 , a rural English doctor , Edward Jenner , introduces smallpox vaccination using vaccinia , a virus grown on the underside of the cow .
( Chapter 2 , “ The Peculiar History of Vaccinia ” ) .
Tragedy :
In 1901 , smallpox vaccine contaminated with tetanus kills an estimated 90 children , mostly in the Philadelphia area , after manufacturers rush “ green , ” contaminated vaccine to market to fight a smallpox epidemic .
This is one of many disease outbreaks linked to contaminated smallpox vaccine .
Even when the vaccine is free of contaminating bacteria , it can be dangerous .
In 1971 , after a campaign led by Dr.C. Henry Kempe , pediatricians end the routine vaccination of American children against smallpox -- to prevent the estimated 10 deaths a year from the vaccine itself .
( Chapter 3 , “ Vaccine Wars ” ; Chapter 6 , “ Battling Measles , Remodeling Society ” )
2. Diphtheria
Triumph : In the 1890s , New York City bacteriologists William H. Park and Hermann Biggs begin administering diphtheria antibodies , grown in horses .
Later , a combination of antibodies and diphtheria toxins are administered , allowing children to build a more robust immune response .
Finally , in 1928 the city begins using diphtheria toxoid , made from deactivated diphtheria proteins .
The disease once known as " childhood 's greatest scourge , " is nearly eradicated in the United States by the end of World War II .
Outbreaks still sometimes strike in far - flung or medically weakened places , including several former Soviet republics in the 1990s , after soldiers from Afghanistan bring home a virulent form of diphtheria .
( Chapter 4 , “ War is Good for Children ” )
Tragedy :
The use of antisera grown in horses and other animals creates a laboratory for immune system disorders .
Horse proteins frequently cause serious reactions in children given diphtheria serum .
The terms anaphylaxis , allergy and serum sickness are coined in the early 20th century to descibee the immune responses to foreign proteins contained in vaccines and sera .
3. Polio
Triumph : Franklin Delano Roosevelt contracts polio in 1921 , and three years later he purchases Warm Springs , a spa in Georgia , so that polio patients like himself could get decent occupational therapy in an atmosphere of fellowship .
Roosevelt convinces his law partner , Basil O’Connor , to administer Warm Springs .
O’Connor ’s philanthropy , eventually called the March of Dimes , becomes the major source of funding for vaccine development .
In 1955 , Jonas Salk ’s inactivated polio vaccine is licensed amid much jubilation .
Five years later , a live , oral polio vaccine created by Albert Sabin at the University of Cincinnati comes on the market , and soon becomes the dominant vaccine .
By early 2007 , Sabin ’s vaccine has nearly eradicated polio worldwide .
The Western Hemosphere 's last case of wild polio is reported in 1991 .
Tragedy : Experimental vaccines developed by John Kollmer and Maurice Brody in the late 1930s cause hundreds of cases of polio .
Shortly after the Salk vaccine is licensed , improperly inactivated vaccine causes a polio epidemic of its own , paralyzing about 200 people and giving thousands transient cases of the disease .
Then scientists discover , in 1961 , that the Salk vaccine had been grown in monkey kidney tissues contaminated with SV40 , a virus that causes cancer in lab animals .
Epidemiological evidence later suggests that the virus has caused few , if any , cancers in the children who received it .
Sabin ’s live vaccine causes about one case of polio for every million doses administered , usually affecting people with compromised immune systems .
4. Measles , Rubella and other Viral Vaccines
Triumph : Viral vaccines produce two Nobel prizes in the postwar era .
The first goes to Max Theiler of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in New York , who shows that when yellow fever virus is grown in a series of tissues , the virus loses most of its virulence and becomes suitable to use as a live vaccine .
The second goes to John Enders , Frederick Robbins and Thomas Weller at Harvard University , who show it is possible to grow and attenuate viruses in tissue cultures–pieces of tissue from humans and various animals , pasted to the side of laboratory glassware .
The work of Enders , Robbins and Weller facilitates Salk ’s vaccine .
Sam Katz , another Enders protegee , helps create a live measles vaccine by growing measles in human amniotic and chick tissues in 1954 .
Pharmaceutical companies make a variety of measles vaccines starting with this recipe .
The maker of the Merck vaccine , Maurice Hilleman , goes on to attenuate mumps virus in a similar medium in 1965 , and grows rubella virus in duck embryos , eventually creating the first measles - mumps - rubella , or MMR vaccine .
Before these vaccines , measles struck about 3 million American children each year , killing or crippling about 10,000 kids every year .
Rubella , which strikes in waves , left an estimated 30,000 children with severe birth defects during an epidemic in the mid-1960s .
In 2002 and 2005 , respectively , the Panamerican Health Organization declares that measles and rubella transmission has ceased throughout the Americas .
Tragedy : Yellow fever vaccine is a lifesaver , but difficult to make .
In the early 1940s , scientists at the Rockefeller Institute find they need human serum to stabilize the vaccine .
In early 1942 , vaccine contaminated with hepatitis B virus is injected into 300,000 American troops , prostrating thousands of them in the months following Pearl Harbor .
Many of the early measles vaccines are poorly made ; two of the killed - virus vaccines , made by Pfizer and Lilly , respectively , are faulty because the inactivation process has damaged some of the measles proteins , resulting in “ atypical measles ” –- with severe allergic reactions and pneumonia -- when the patient encounters the " natural " measles virus .
5. Whooping Cough
Triumph : Whooping cough has been one of the most severe and deadly childhood illnesses .
Often fatal to infants , it produces a prolonged cough and shortness of breath for around three months , and sometimes causes permanent lung damage .
In the 1940s , Pearl Kendrick and Grace Elderling at the Michigan Department of Health develop the first reliable whooping cough vaccine .
Working with Margaret Pittman of the National Institute of Health , Kendrick develops tests for the efficacy and safety of this vaccine , made from killed pertussis bacteria .
In the United States , whooping cough vaccines reduce what had been a devastating childhood illness , with thousands of deaths each year , to a far less severe threat .
But immunity to whooping cough wanes , and many older people contract whooping cough–and spread it –without realizing they are sick with the disease .
There are currently as many as 1 million cases of whooping cough each year in the United States–and at least 20 deaths .
Tragedy :
While whooping cough vaccine has prevented more death and suffering than perhaps any vaccine currently in use , it has been devilishly hard to make reliably and safely .
The whole cell vaccine is causes seizures , high fevers and rarely , permanent brain damage .
Parents who believe their children have been damaged by the vaccine file many lawsuits in the 1980s .
These suits threatened to drive vaccine makers out of the business until Congress in 1986 passes a law to compensate vaccine - injured children , while giving a measure of liability protection to manufacturers .
We did n't see this on the Courtney Love New Year 's resolution list :
Date washed up rocker
Nevertheless , Kurt Cobain 's widow has decided to follow such a course of action , as she 's been seen around town on the arm of former Smashing Pumpkins singer , Billy Corgan .
Having sort of seen Courtney Love nude , we can't exactly claim we know what Corgan is thinking on this one .
Then again , since 1979 - the song , not the year - this frontman has n't exacty been in demand , either .
Still , we imagine Billy and Larry Birkhead sharing a drink some time in the future and wondering what the heck they were thinking .

Three of the nation ’s largest investment banks said they have borrowed from a program created this week by the Federal Reserve to stimulate lending amid concern that Wall Street faced a cash shortage .
“ We have tested the window because we want to remove the stigma from the window , ” said Morgan Stanley Chief Financial Officer Colm Kelleher in an interview yesterday , referring to the Fed lending program .
“ It ’s meant to be there for normal business .
It ’s not meant to be there as a last - recourse thing . ”
Erin Callan , chief financial officer of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. , said the company used the window Tuesday night , adding : “ We wanted to show some leadership . ”
Michael DuVally , a spokesman for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. , said his firm also is “ testing ” the Fed facility , which opened Monday , and will use it “ if doing so makes sense from an economic and funding diversification point of view . ”
Wall Street firms were reluctant to turn to the Fed earlier this week because of concern that it might make them appear financially weak , The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday .

Click to viewUDC is one of a handful of companies pioneering OLED development and manufacturing techniques for the big boys such as Samsung , Sony , LG and of course , the US Department of Defense .
No one 's written about how they make these displays , panels that 'll make up our next generation of super - slim HDTVs , until now .
This week , Benny and I visited Universal Display Corporation 's headquarters in Princeton , NJ for an exclusive tour of the factory , where we witnessed just how they make 'em .
We gowned up , donned stylish hairnets and observed OLED panel fabrication up close , a process that involves expensive super - heated dope and something called a shadow mask .
( Sounds like fairly nice evening in Vegas , does n't it ? )
Advertisement
OLEDs ( organic light - emitting diodes ) differ from LCDs in that they do n't need a backlight of any kind , because each pixel is made of a phosphorescent particle that lights up on its own when excited .
The trick is getting the particles onto the glass , plastic or metallic screen — the substrate , they call it — in an orderly fashion .
There are a few techniques , but here 's the basic process :
1 . The phosphorescent colored particles , or " dope , " are prepared .
The three colors , red , green and blue , are actually made from powders that are red , yellow and orange .
To this day no one is certain why .
The powder is carried in vials to the fabrication room .
Advertisement
2. Meanwhile , in a Class 100 clean room ( shown in video and gallery under UV protective yellow - tinted glass ) , the substrate is prepared to be fused with the particles .
I think I saw a salad bar in the back , but our guide , Janice Mahon , VP of Technology Commercialization , only laughed knowingly .
Intel has Class 10 clean rooms , btw , but Jesus says his mom's house is even cleaner than that .
3 . Here 's where the magic happens : dope meets substrate in a sticky act of love .
In the big business of OLEDs these days there are four ways to make this happen :
• Vacuum Thermal Evaporation -
This is UDC 's tried and true technique , a hot and steamy method involving super - heated dope that evaporates up into a grid , known as the shadow mask , that is placed over the substrate .
First the red particles are evaporated , then the grid is shifted ever so slightly , then green is evaporated , then a final shift for blue .
In the end , the panel has RGB pixels evenly distributed across the whole thing .
Since you have to hang the shadow mask up under the substrate , there 's a chance it could sag on larger screens , so VTE is aimed at smaller screens .
• Organic Vapor Phase Deposition -
This is where the vapor is heated up then streamed into a system of " showerheads " that deposit the particles on a cooled substrate .
• Ink - Jet Printing -
If the dope can be mixed into liquid form , it can run through technology similar to the stuff inside your printer .
Precise depositing of dots on a substrate is easy , but the challenges are turning the dope into a liquid and then depositing the right amount in little wells on the substrate where they can dry .
Advertisement
• Organic Vapor Jet Printing -
It 's what it sounds like , a printing technique that lets you shoot particles through a printhead and straight onto the substrate .
The benefit of this is that you do n't have to turn the stuff into a liquid first , and you do n't have to worry about getting the particles to dry later .
But it 's still really really hard .

Glass is the easiest thing to use to make OLEDs , because it is rigid and because it is not porous : moisture and oxygen can't get in and ruin the little glowing organic molecules .
Plastic is the worst , because it is easily penetrated .
Metal foil is a middle ground , because the metal side keeps the molecules secure , but the glowing side still needs a special coating , and wo n't last as long as a glass OLED .
Like phosphors in a plasma TV , OLED materials fade over their lifetime , even when tightly sealed .
At this point , red and green last hundreds of thousands of hours , so they could easily last as long as other technologies .
But blue is still an issue .
In any situation , it 's going to be the first to go , though some OLED panels are now being rated in the 50,000 - hour range .

FALLUJA , Iraq ( Reuters ) - Residents of Falluja have seen their streets emptied of cars , motorbikes and even bicycles for more than two months under a vehicle ban aimed at curbing violence in the Sunni Arab town .
And they are split .
While some welcome the increased security , many complain that it is a form of collective punishment against a town which is synonymous with the insurgency against U.S. forces in Iraq ’s western Anbar province .
“ The decision to stop car movement is very unjust and an attempt to increase depression and poverty on the city , ” said Abdul - Karim Khalid , a 30 - year - old car mechanic .
“ My work has stopped and I have been forced into unemployment .
I have spent all my money to ensure my family lives . ”
But his friend Saad Farhan says the vehicle ban is preferable to the violence that has blighted the town .
“ Before this was implemented , we greatly feared masked gunmen who killed civilians and escaped using cars , ” said the 33 year old , who sells car accessories .
“ We do suffer from a lack of work , but we have the blessing of relative quiet now , ” Farhan said .
Iraqi authorities imposed the ban in the town to prevent drive - by shootings and car bombings that have plagued Falluja .
According to a declassified U.S. intelligence report , attacks in the former insurgent stronghold of 300,000 people have dropped from nearly 200 a month in December to fewer than 30 in June .
The vehicle ban was first imposed on May 25 , a day after a suicide car bomb hit a funeral for a tribal leader opposed to Sunni Islamist al Qaeda , killing 27 people .
In 2004 the U.S. military launched two major assaults on Falluja to end the control of al Qaeda fighters and other Sunni Arab militant groups who had imposed strict Islamic laws on the town .
The assaults left much of the town destroyed .
After taking control of the town , U.S. soldiers required residents to have their fingerprints taken and their irises scanned for identification cards that allowed them to leave and re-enter Falluja .
Police chief Colonel Faisal al - Zobaie said he expected the vehicle ban to be lifted at the beginning of September .
“ Police patrols are working night and day to pursue and capture terrorists so we can clean the city from their evil , ” he said .
Commuter buses and food trucks are allowed to drive through the city only with special badges .
Taxi driver Jamal Hussein , 46 , blamed local authorities and U.S. forces for the loss of his earnings .
“ They are trying to kill the people of Falluja very slowly .
For more than two months , I sat at home looking at my car during the day and night because I ’m prevented from driving it .
Is this right ? ”
Here 's an interesting and even - handed account of the case against AIPAC's Keith Weissman and Steven Rosen for passing along classified information .
Emotionally , I 'm torn between amusement at the idea of seeing AIPAC's ox gored and the reality that the precedent the government is seeking to put in place here has some grim implications for press freedom .
I am sure , however , that this line of argument is absurd :
“ It ’s absurd for anyone to think that the Israelis have to enlist people to spy , ” says Sandra Charles , a former Pentagon and National Security Council official who consults in Washington for Persian Gulf Arab governments .
“ They can go to the highest levels of the administration if they want to find out what the thinking is on US policy . ”
Charles might want to visit Jonathan Pollard in prison if she really thinks Israel would never try to enlist spies .
The fact that so many US government officials are willing to talk to Israeli officials or Israel 's friends is precisely the point , it makes Israeli espionage possible , not superfluous .

On the heels of his widely publicized scolding by the King of Spain ( big poppa ) , the people of Venezuela came out in their numbers to show the dictator who ’s boss .
After weeks of boasting that his polls show him securing a safe victory , Chavez lost his bid to rule Venezuela indefinitely .
Thank -
God , is all I have to say !
Who does this guy think he is ?
Victory for Chavez would have meant not only indefinite rule but the advancement of his socialist agenda .
What does this mean ?
Well according to those who propagate socialism , it means nobody will be poor and everybody will be working merrily to build a better nation .
Of course this is exactly what it will be like , or at least that is what we will read in the censored newspapers .
The encyclopedia Britannica defines socialism as a system of social organization in which property and the distribution of income are subject to social control rather than individual determination or market forces .
This basically means you cannot work your way up the ladder and become rich like Oprah Winfrey or Bill Gates .
You can do the work but your wealth is controlled and the amount of property you own is regulated .
No “ American dream , ” exists with this system .
Does this sound similar to something else ?
Yes you guessed it .
Socialism is just the precursor to Communism .
In a socialist society , the media is owned and controlled wholly by the government .
No independent objective voice will exist to hold government officials accountable for their actions .
Chavez has already shut down the only independent media house in Venezuela .
What happens when politicians are not subject to public scrutiny ?
Dictatorship .
Corruption .
Abuse and Neglect .
Yes he may be helping the poor now but anybody who opposes freedom of the press has something to hide .
Chavez may have lost the battle but the war has just begun

Topping the list of furry villains is the Cookie Monster , whose penchant for devouring cookies and the odd plate or two is no longer deemed appropriate behaviour for modern children .
His alter ego , Alistair Cookie , host of MonsterPiece Theatre , " modelled the wrong behaviour " by smoking a pipe and eating it , according to Sesame Street producer Carol - Lynn Parente .
Back then , Big Bird 's bumbling friend Mr Snuffleupagus was still imaginary , which might encourage " delusion behaviour " .
And trash - loving Oscar the Grouch has been targetted for his blatant bad manners and questionable hygiene .
" We might not be able to create a character like Oscar today , " Parente told The New York Times .
Like the whitewashing of Enid Blyton books , the move has sparked howls of protest and charges of political correctness sucking the fun out of childhood .
Children 's book author Andy Griffiths , creator of the popular " Bum " series , said children loved dark , mischievous characters such as those who lived on Sesame Street .
" Kids love seeing their primal desires acted out in the form of things like gluttony or violence , and literature or TV is a place they can safely experience these desires , " he said .
" I think it 's an entirely healthy and appropriate thing for a children 's TV program to be doing . "
Griffiths said children could tell the difference between fantasy and reality and did not blindly mimic the behaviour of clearly fictional characters .
" People who claim to be protecting children always make the assumption that what children see is what they will do , " he said .
" Underlying that is the assumption that kids can't tell the difference between fantasy and real life and I have found that to be consistently bogus . "
Andrew Fuller , a clinical psychologist and consultant on children 's television production , said a sanitised world was far more dangerous than the whacky world of Sesame Street .
" Unless we expose kids to a diverse range of characters and behaviour they will not be prepared for the real world , " he said .
The ABC , which has broadcast Sesame Street since 1971 , would no longer consider the original episodes suitable children 's material , head of children 's programming Tim Brooke - Hunt said .
" We might screen them in the context of a discussion about what was happening back then , but now they are not appropriate as children 's TV , " he said .
" The reality is that the majority of kids are not going to copy this behaviour , but as producers of these shows we have to think about what might happen with the minority .
" If even a small number of kids might do it you have a problem . "
But he admitted such lengths could threaten the joy of childhood .
" Yes , I suppose there is that danger , but I just hope parents do n't look to TV to give their children all their fun . "
Huckabee gave speech to white supremacists Max Blumenthal
Published : Friday January 18 , 2008
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This As South Carolina 's Republican primary election draws nearer , Mike Huckabee has ratcheted up his appeals to the racial nationalism of white evangelicals .
" You do n't like people from outside the state coming in and telling you what to do with your flag , " the former Arkansas governor told a Myrtle Beach crowd on January 17 , referring to the Confederate flag .
" If somebody came to Arkansas and told us what to do with our flag , we 'd tell them what to do with the pole .
That 's what we 'd do . "
Making coded appeals to white racism is nothing new for Huckabee .
Indeed , well before he was a nationally known political star , Huckabee nurtured a relationship with America 's largest white supremacist group , the Council of Conservative Citizens .
The extent of Huckabee 's interaction with the racist group is unclear , but this much is known : he accepted an invitation to speak at the group 's annual conference in 1993 and ultimately delivered a videotaped address that was " extremely well received by the audience . "
Descended from the White Citizens Councils that battled integration in the Jim Crow South , including at Arkansas ' Little Rock High School , the Council ( or CofCC ) has been designated a " hate group " by the Southern Poverty Law Center .
In its " Statement of Principles , " the CofCC declares , " We also oppose all efforts to mix the races of mankind , to promote non-white races over the European - American people through so - called " affirmative action " and similar measures , to destroy or denigrate the European - American heritage , including the heritage of the Southern people , and to force the integration of the races . "
The CofCC has hosted several conservative Republican legislators at its conferences , including former Representative Bob Barr of Georgia and Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi .
But mostly it has been a source of embarrassment to Republicans hoping to move their party beyond its race - baiting image .
Former Reagan speechwriter and conservative pundit Peggy Noonan pithily declared that anyone involved with the CofCC " does not deserve to be in a leadership position in America . "
During a lengthy phone conversation in 2006 , CofCC founder and former White Citizens Council organizer Gordon Lee Baum detailed for me Huckabee 's dalliances with his group .
Baum told me that Huckabee eagerly accepted his invitation to speak at the CofCC 's 1993 national convention in Memphis , Tennessee .
Huckabee 's plan was complicated , however , when Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker journeyed out of state and appointed a state senator to preside over the governorship .
The Arkansas state legislature passed a resolution forbidding the lieutenant governor from leaving Arkansas until Tucker returned , thus preventing Huckabee from attending the CofCC 's conference .
In lieu of his appearance , according to Baum , Huckabee " sent an audio / video presentation saying ' I can't be with you but I 'd like to be speaker next time . ' "
( The CofCC promptly replaced Huckabee with Michael Ramirez , a right - wing cartoonist whose work is currently syndicated to 400 newspapers by the Copley News Service . )
Baum 's account of Huckabee 's videotaped message was confirmed by a CofCC newsletter obtained by Edward Sebesta , a veteran observer of the neo-Confederate movement .
" Ark. Lt. Governor Mike Huckabee , unable to leave Arkansas by law because the Governor was absent from the state , sent a terrific videotape speech , which was viewed and extremely well received by the audience , " the 1993 newsletter ( Vol. 24 , No. 3 ) reported .
The following year , in 1994 , the CofCC held its national conference in Little Rock , Arkansas to accommodate Huckabee .
According to Baum , Huckabee initially agreed to speak before his group , but became apprehensive when the Arkansas media reported that he would be joined on the CofCC 's podium by Kirk Lyons , a white nationalist legal activist who has hailed Hitler as " probably the most misunderstood man in German history . "
" He did n't know anything about Kirk Lyons or anyone else , " Baum said of Huckabee .
" He said he would show up if we took Lyons off . "
But Baum refused to remove his friend Lyons from the bill .
Huckabee , who was more concerned about receiving bad publicity than by the racist underpinnings of the CofCC , withdrew his promise to speak .
The CofCC replaced him this time with former Arkansas Supreme Court Justice Jim Johnson , a White Citizens Council founder who organized the mob that rioted against the integration of Little Rock High School and later served as the star narrator of Rev. Jerry Falwell 's discredited film , " The Clinton Chronicles . "
In the end , Huckabee 's aborted relationship with the CofCC benefited the group .
" We had the biggest crowd in our history because of the publicity " surrounding Huckabee 's planned appearance , Baum said of his 1994 conference .
The CofCC has since rebuked Huckabee for his insufficiently intolerant political behavior .
Unfortunately , Huckabee has never rebuked the CofCC .
Instead he embraced the group , ignoring its well known legacy of promoting racism and only severing ties when his political ambitions were threatened by bad publicity .

Home sales in Southern California plummeted in September to a two - decade low , and a rash of grim housing - market assessments Tuesday suggested the worst is yet to come .
“ We ’re on our way down and still picking up speed , ” said Christopher Thornberg , a Los Angeles - based economist who four years ago warned that the pace of housing price gains in the region could n’t be sustained .
The gloom extended to Washington , where Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. called the U.S. housing downturn the “ most significant current risk to our economy . ”
Paulson echoed a prediction by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke on Monday that the slump would be a “ significant drag ” on economic growth into next year .
Adding to the sobering picture , the National Assn. of Home Builders said its builders ’ confidence index hit a record low .
The index , which tracks builders ’ views of market conditions and sales expectations for the coming six months , fell to 18 from 20 in August .
It has been below 50 -- above which indicates a positive industry outlook -- since May 2006 .
In Southern California in September , home sales in six counties -- Los Angeles , Orange , Riverside , San Bernardino , San Diego and Ventura -- fell 48.5 % from the same month last year .
They were at their lowest since DataQuick Information Systems , a real estate service , began compiling such statistics in 1988 .
The median price in five of the counties slipped , and in Los Angeles County it moved up only 1.2 % .
The relatively high price of property in L.A. County can prop up the region ’s median -- the point at which half the homes sell for less and half sell for more -- even as overall sales fall .
Garden Grove real estate broker Patrick Schwier , who specializes in apartment buildings , said he had sold 70 % fewer buildings this year compared with the same period in 2006 , and recently saw one sale fall through when the potential buyer ’s loan application was rejected .
Schwier said he saw two more years of falling sales and prices .
“ Prices were too inflated when credit was easier , ” he said , and now home prices , though they ’ve been slipping , still “ do n’t make sense .
And they will drop until they make sense . ”
DataQuick President Marshall Prentice blamed the declines on the trouble people had last month obtaining jumbo loans , which are for more than $ 417,000 -- loans many buyers need to purchase property in Southern California , where the median price in September was $ 462,000 .
“ It ’s likely there will be some catch - up sales activity as jumbo loans become available again , ” Prentice said .
Delores Conway , director of USC ’s Casden Real Estate Economics Forecast , said September sales were probably hurt by tighter lending standards that went into effect in August in response to the sub - prime mortgage meltdown .
But she said weak sales and prices also showed the market was correcting itself after years of surging prices .
Los Angeles mortgage broker Mitchell Ohlbaum , however , said that although jumbo financing was tougher to obtain for many of his clients , all were able to finance their purchases .
“ We had some challenges , but we were able to get them done , ” Ohlbaum said .
Thornberg discounted the overall credit squeeze ’s effect on the housing market .
He said housing prices , pumped up for years by questionable mortgages , had to drop considerably .
The median income of L.A. County homeowners , he said , is at 60 % of what ’s required to buy a median - priced home in the county , assuming a housing budget of 35 % of gross income .
Many people have mortgages they can’t afford , such as those that start with a very low “ teaser ” interest rate that rises dramatically over time .
When those loans reset at higher rates -- as many are scheduled to next year -- the market could be in for another shock as more over - extended homeowners go into foreclosure .
“ This thing ’s going to get worse when the peak of resets occur next year , ” Thornberg , the L.A. economist , said .
His prediction : Southern California sales and prices will decline into 2009 .
In Washington , Paulson said , “ The longer housing prices remain stagnant or fall , the greater the penalty to our future economic growth . ”
The Treasury secretary said the government should take some steps , such as nationalizing standards for the licensing and monitoring of mortgage brokers , which could clamp down on predatory behavior by unethical lenders .
But he stressed that there was no call for a government bailout .
“ When investors are relieved of the cost of bad decisions , they are more likely to repeat their mistakes , ” Paulson said in a speech at Georgetown University Law Center .
“ I have no interest in bailing out lenders or property speculators . ”
Paulson has urged private - sector action , calling a meeting last month to discuss bond - market troubles .
Three big banks announced plans Monday for an $ 80 - billion fund to buy bonds whose values have plummeted in the wake of the credit crunch induced by the sub - prime mortgage troubles .
The comments he made in the speech at Georgetown marked a change in tone by the administration .
Until now , President Bush and his advisors had suggested that the problems appeared to be contained to the housing sector and would not trigger a recession .
Mickey Levy , chief economist at Bank of America Corp. in New York , said Paulson ’s giving a speech about housing was enlightening .
“ The fact that he addresses this issue reflects heightening concern by the administration regarding the implications for the rest of the economy of the housing downturn and the growing problem with housing finance , ” Levy said .
Ken Goldstein , an economist with the Conference Board in New York , countered that as bad as the situation might be now , “ it ’s not intensifying . ”
“ My view is that indeed , we ’re mired in a slump in housing .
I do n’t really think it ’s getting much worse , ” Goldstein said .
“ But I do agree it will take until 2009 until we start to see housing improve a little bit . ”
The bad news continued Tuesday as Countrywide Financial Corp. , the nation ’s largest mortgage lender , reported it would take a pretax restructuring charge of $ 125 million to $ 150 million to cut expenses because of slower lending .
The Calabasas - based mortgage giant said it might cut 10,000 to 12,000 jobs .
D.R. Horton Inc. , the nation ’s second - largest home builder , said its new - home orders fell to a six - year low in the third quarter because of customer cancellations and tighter financing .

What Natasha does on the bed in the dingy room with flaking orange paint so shames her she cannot bring herself to use the word .
She calls it " so and so " and sells it here from midday to midnight , six days a week .
On a very good day she makes £ 45 .
With each 30 - minute session earning £ 2.50 that works out at 18 different men , many drunk , some violent .
She tries to forget the very good days .
" I do n't want to be with a strange man who wants to kiss your whole body .
Some suck you up and leave red marks .
It 's ugly . "
Natasha shuddered .
" Ugly , ugly , ugly . "
Three years ago she won two beauty contests and was runner - up in another two , including Miss Best Legs , on Nicaragua 's impoverished Caribbean coast .
With dreams of modelling she boarded a bus for the distant capital , Managua .
But Nicaragua has not fully recovered from its 1980s war and remains the second - poorest country in the Americas after Haiti .
Economic necessity kills many dreams .
Now 19 , she is a veteran of Salvadoreño , a bar and brothel in a tough barrio known as Costa Rica .
The days pass in a miasma of beer , sweat and perfume .
" I would not wish my worst enemy to be here , " she said .
" This is the worst thing you can do . "
Not quite , it turns out .
There is an even worse alternative : doing nothing .
Two months ago police raids shut brothels across the city , expelled clients and sent sex workers home .
The leftwing Sandinista government billed the crackdown as a socially progressive effort to protect women from exploitation .
The would - be beneficiaries did not see it that way .
Their work , however ghastly , was a ticket out of poverty .
Dozens of prostitutes from Salvadoreño led a revolt against what they said was a violation of rights .
Emerging from the shadows of their trade , they went public and mounted an unprecedented media campaign to overturn the ban .
Astonished by the protests , the authorities relented and within a week the women were back at work .
" It was just before Christmas and we badly needed money for our families , " said Carolina Hacks , 23 , another worker at Salvadoreño .
" But then we always need money , we 're the breadwinners for our children and parents . "
The Managua - based Central American Health Institute , a non-governmental organisation which funds medical treatment and disease prevention and is known by its Spanish initials ICAS , welcomed the end of the crackdown .
" That sort of repression drives the trade further underground and makes the women less accessible to us , " said Zoyla Segura , a health worker .
" This protest was something positive because it showed an awareness of their rights . "
Profiting from the earnings of prostitution is illegal but authorities have long turned a blind eye to the bars , massage parlours and strip clubs which employ most of the city 's estimated 1,500 sex workers .
Salvadoreño , a courtyard of plastic tables where men drink knee - high bottles of beer , has been operating for 35 years .
Traders wander in , hawking snacks , baby clothes and pirated DVDs .
Everything is for sale , including the waitresses who provide " servicios " in the seven bedrooms adjacent to the bar .
Sex costs £ 3.25 , of which 75 p goes to the business and the rest is pocketed by the prostitute , said Marta Lorena , the manager .
" We have 25 chicas working here .
It 's good money for them and for us . "
Though she has gained weight from sipping endless sodas Natasha , who did not want her surname published , retains beauty pageant glamour and is the most sought - after chica .
Her earnings support her mother , aunt and younger brother in Bluefields , a sleepy , humid town which feels more Jamaican than Nicaraguan .
Even on a quiet day she earns more than a doctor or teacher .
On Sunday , her day off , she studies banking at a university , but graduation is at least five years away .
The relative privacy of the work is a consolation .
" There are bars where you dance naked and you 're touched up courtesy of the house . "
Natasha has declined work at more upmarket brothels which pay more for a session but have a lower turnover .
" For now this is my life , " she said , gesturing to the rumpled bed , bare light - bulb and cracked walls .
When a client is especially repellent she urges him to hurry up .
If one turns violent she shouts and bar staff come to her aid .
" Three years and I 'm still not used to it .
You can imagine what it was like on my first day .
I 'd just had one boyfriend before coming here . "
By chance last year the ex-boyfriend visited the bar and spotted her .
" I was so ashamed .
I ran out and cried and cried .
I hope never to see him again . "
Other men from Bluefields have also recognised her .
" I do n't care if the whole of my town knows I 'm here but not my family , not my mum .
I told her I 'm married and that my husband gives me the money .
" That 's a lie . "
I have a very bad opinion of Colin Powell after his puppet role was revealed in the Iraq war , but I 'll get to that later .
This quote from his interview in GQ is very relevant to the political debate about terrorism , especially today of all days .
Q : Is n’t the new global threat we face even more dangerous ?
Powell :
What is the greatest threat facing us now ?
People will say it ’s terrorism .
But are there any terrorists in the world who can change the American way of life or our political system ?
No .
Can they knock down a building ?
Yes .
Can they kill somebody ?
Yes .
But can they change us ?
No .
Only we can change ourselves .
So what is the great threat we are facing ?
I would approach this differently , in almost Marshall - like terms .
What are the great opportunities out there — ones that we can take advantage of ?
It should not be just about creating alliances to deal with a guy in a cave in Pakistan .
It should be about how do we create institutions that keep the world moving down a path of wealth creation , of increasing respect for human rights , creating democratic institutions , and increasing the efficiency and power of market economies ?
This is perhaps the most effective way to go after terrorists .
Many people have turned into scared little bedwetters after the 9/11 attacks who threw their civil rights to the wind while supporting a pre-emptive doctrine which will lead us down the road to hell .
I talk about the right wing blogosphere and their talk show buddies of course .
Being a NYer , the attacks stunned me , but NY picked itself off the floor and went on with life .
These people see jihadists in their rear view mirror every time they get on the highway ...

Nation Giuliani continues his conservative shift Favors fewer rights for same - sex unions Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani continues to discard the moderate and liberal positions of his past .
The latest is civil unions for same - sex couples , which the Republican presidential candidate has been backing away from in recent months .
A campaign aide told the Globe this weekend that Giuliani favors a much more modest set of rights for gay partners than civil union laws in effect in four states offer .
Giuliani has described himself as a backer of civil unions and is frequently described that way in news reports .
But he began distancing himself from civil unions in late April , when his campaign told The New York Sun that New Hampshire 's new law goes too far because it is " the equivalent of marriage , " which he has always opposed for gays .
Giuliani's aides offered little explanation of what specific rights he would support for same - sex couples .
In an interview and follow - up e-mails , Maria Comella , the campaign 's deputy communications director , told the Globe that Giuliani supports domestic partnership laws similar to the one he initiated in New York in 1998 .
The New York law primarily ensures benefits to partners of municipal employees .
The law created a registry of partnerships that also helps city residents obtain partner benefits from private companies that extend them .
However , most of the registrants are unmarried heterosexual couples .
Comella said Giuliani has always supported the New York model of domestic partnership laws but she did not explain what is widely viewed as an inconsistency in his position .
" It 's really disappointing he 's stepped back from his position on civil unions , " said Joe Tarver , spokesman for the Empire State Pride Agenda , a group that advocates for gay rights in New York state that worked with and against Giuliani on a number of issues during his eight years as mayor .
Calling the former mayor 's shifting stance " pretty un - Giuliani - like , " Tarver said : " It 's quite obvious he 's playing to the people whose votes he needs to get the Republican nomination . "
Tarver has company .
Representatives of New York groups who advocate for abortion rights , gun control , and rights for immigrants , also said Giuliani 's actions on the presidential trail , presenting himself to a more conservative GOP electorate , bears little resemblance to the man they knew as the stand - up mayor of Gotham in the 1990s who was open to moderate and liberal arguments .
More than any candidate in the Republican presidential field , rival Mitt Romney has been tagged with the flip - flopper label .
But Giuliani , with late shifts on civil unions and federal campaign finance laws , is a political makeover in progress .
On Aug. 6 , he called his past support of the 2002 McCain - Feingold campaign finance law a mistake , deciding after two election cycles that it does not work .
Giuliani 's transformation is , in many aspects , subtler than that of Romney , who has reversed his support for abortion rights .
Giuliani often cites a states ' rights rationale as the basis of his new views , though his objection to states adopting civil unions is a notable exception .
What was right for his city when he was mayor might not be for other states , he says frequently to explain changing stances .
Of Giuliani 's past assertions endorsing civil unions , Comella said the definition has changed over time beyond what Giuliani supports .
Giuliani has used the terms civil unions and domestic partnerships interchangeably , as in comments in 2004 to Fox News 's Bill O'Reilly .
" I 'm in favor of . . . civil unions , " Giuliani said .
" So now you have a civil partnership , domestic partnership , civil union , whatever you want to call it , and that takes care of the imbalance , the discrimination , which we should n't have . "
But that was nearly four years after Vermont became the first state to enact civil unions , which provided marriage - like benefits to same - sex partners .
" It 's about rights and benefits more than the title , " Comella wrote in an e-mail to the Globe .
" The mayor supports the benefits and rights as they are written in the domestic partnership law in New York City . "
Like New Hampshire , civil union laws in Vermont , Connecticut , and New Jersey " confer upon same - sex couples all of the state ( though none of the federal ) rights , protections , and obligations afforded married spouses , " according to the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation , a national advocacy group .
Benefits of domestic partnerships can also be broader than those under the New York law .
Giuliani is attempting to become the first GOP presidential nominee since Gerald Ford in 1976 to support abortion rights .
But he has wavered significantly from his once steadfast support for Roe v. Wade , the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion .
Moreover , he has done an about - face on the issue of late - term abortions and has made numerous statements over the years about public funding of abortions that have been viewed as inconsistent .
Most recently he decided to support the Hyde Amendment of 1976 ( which he opposed while mayor ) , which banned federal funding for abortions under the Medicaid program except in cases of rape , incest , and danger to the life of the mother .
" We were pretty dumbfounded as an organization when we heard him say things like he'd be fine either way if Roe v. Wade was overturned or kept , " said Mary Alice Carr , spokeswoman for the New York state affiliate of NARAL Pro-Choice America , referring to Giuliani 's remarks during a televised GOP presidential debate in May .
When he ran for a second term as mayor in 1997 , Giuliani scored a 100 - percent rating on the abortion rights group 's questionnaire and as mayor held events to mark the anniversary of the landmark court case , which he termed historic , she said .
" His record was so clear , " Carr said .
Until recently , Giuliani , who has always said he personally opposes abortion , had many times expressed opposition to a federal ban to the late - term procedure that is called partial - birth abortion by its opponents , who consider it infanticide .
In 1996 and 1997 , President Clinton vetoed bills that would have made it a federal crime for doctors to perform the procedure .
Giuliani voiced his support for Clinton 's actions and as recently as 2000 , when he was briefly a candidate for the US Senate , said he would " vote to preserve the option for women . "
This year , however , he endorsed the federal partial - birth abortion ban signed by President Bush in 2003 and in April praised a US Supreme Court ruling upholding the ban .
" As long as there 's provision for the life of the mother , then that 's something that should be done , " Giuliani said in February while advocating the ban in an interview .
However , the 1997 bill vetoed by Clinton and the one signed by Bush six years later contained almost identical language concerning what Giuliani cites as the critical requirement for his support of a ban -- an exception if the procedure was required to save the life of a mother .
" One of the things we always said about Rudy Giuliani , and it's his political capital , really , is what you see is what you get , " Carr said .
" He was always in your face .
To now see a guy who says it does n't matter either way on Roe v. Wade , we do n't understand who this guy is . "
Chung - Wha Hong , executive director of the New York Immigration Coalition , has a similar view on Giuliani 's hardening stance on immigration .
" When he was mayor , he spoke up for what was fair , " she said .
As mayor , Giuliani fought in the courts to preserve the city 's right to withhold from federal officials the immigration status of city residents who received benefits from the city .
He was a great defender of immigrants , legal and illegal , and , in 1994 , at a press conference declared : " If you come here and you work hard and you happen to be in an undocumented status , you 're one of the people who we want in this city .
You 're somebody that we want to protect , and we want you to get out from under what is often a life of being like a fugitive , which is really unfair . "
Giuliani , who became known as " America 's mayor " for his efforts after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , now frames the immigration issue in terms of protecting the country from terrorists .
He vigorously opposed the comprehensive immigration measure that died in Congress this year .
He says he opposes amnesty for undocumented immigrants and favors strong border security and a tamper - proof ID card .
" It 's very disappointing that he 's not showing more depth of understanding , " Hong said .
" Despite his strong record on understanding immigrant issues as a local official . . . it sounds like he 's resorting to simplistic , anti-immigrant rhetoric rather than coming up with a workable plan . "
As a chief executive who presided over a sharp decline in crime in New York , Giuliani was a staunch supporter of strict gun control laws , including at the federal level , and was a high - profile supporter of the federal ban on assault weapons that expired in 2004 .
But as a presidential candidate he describes himself as " a strict constructionist " on the Second Amendment right to bear arms , advocating that reasonable restrictions be legislated by the individual states .
" As mayor , he talked about the need for strong federal laws because cities were at the mercy of the states with weak laws , " said Jackie Kuhls , executive director of New Yorkers Against Gun Violence , a statewide group .
" He clearly knows that as a fact but he 's backing away . "
" Disappointing is too weak a word , " said Kuhls .
" I think he is pandering . "

It was embarrassing enough that Mark Stahnke woke up in a neighbor 's yard without his pants .
Then he remembered they contained a cashier 's check for $ 41,093 , meant for his son , and several hundred dollars in cash .
But he got it all back Friday , including the pants , thanks to a man and his dog .
Stahnke said he does n't know what happened between when he left the bar and when he woke up the next morning , and police were skeptical when he filed a report on Monday .
" We 're used to hearing weird stories , but with his intoxication we figured this one would be different , that the amount of money would n't be exact , " Police Lt. William Graham said .
" How do you get so intoxicated that you lose your pants ? "
Stahnke said he had met his son at a bar and does n't remember much afterward .
" I woke up cold not knowing where the heck I was , and I did n't realize it at first because I still had my shoes and socks on , " he said .
" When I got up , I realized , my God , I do n't have any pants . "
Tim Curzan 's dog , Joe , found the pants at an intersection , according to a police report .
He found the cashier 's check and tried twice , unsuccessfully , to deliver it and the cash to where he thought the owner lived .
On Wednesday , the pants were still at the intersection , so Curzan took them to the police , who contacted Stahnke to claim his belongings .

Canadian Christopher Paul Neil , a 32 - year - old English teacher who has taught in South Korea and Vietnam , is being sought in the infamous case of a serial pedophile who extensively photographed himself raping
Thai boys as young as six , uploading the 200 + pictures to the Internet , but digitally altering the photographs to hide his own identity ( although not those of the victims ) .
His whereabouts are currently unknown , and it is believed that he is attempting to evade capture .
German experts attempted to uncover an identifiable picture of the suspect by undoing the manipulations , giving the above final image .
This was enough to get an ID on a suspect , Christopher Paul Neil , who has posted on the Korean Job Discussion Board using the name Peter Jackson .
a current picture of Christopher Paul Neil at Bangkok Airport
Among other things , his posts mentioned how he got around the mandatory criminal records check for English teachers .
Police checks are NOT needed to get a visa .
Public schools will want one but you should be able to stall them .
Often they want teachers SO quickly that they will “ wait ” for some things .
I never gave a police check for my last public school job .
I was in Vietnam at the time and getting one was n’t easy .
I delayed and never heard about it again .
and how to hide things from inspectors :
[ I ] ’ve never heard of porn been a problem in Korea .
On my first trip there in 2000 I remember reading the customs declaration form while on the plane .
I was SO nervous for the remaining hours on the plane because I happened to have a couple Penthouse magazines in my bag .
I ended up tossing them in the bin at the airport washroom , only to find out that no one would have found them anyway .

I did n’t work with him ( his former school has been informed , and if they know anything , they ’re not telling at this point . )
To be perfectly honest , I perceived him as the kind of guy who did n’t have much luck with girls and would be comfortable purchasing sex ( just based on his overall presentation and some comments he made regarding working girls in Thailand . )
I would n’t have been surprised if he had had a fake degree or passport– but I would never ever have guessed that he was sexually into children .
We did n’t discuss it , and I never saw him around children .

WASHINGTON - The American Civil Liberties Union expressed its outrage that Attorney General Alberto Gonzales lied to Congress in order to make a case for reauthorization of the Patriot Act in 2005 .
The Attorney General testified that he was unaware of any civil liberties abuses that had taken place with the use of NSLs , which allow FBI agents to request records without court approval .
But contrary to Gonzales ' testimony internal FBI documents show he was well aware of the abuses .
The documents were received through a freedom of information request from the Electronic Frontier Foundation .
He and other members of the administration went on to testify that no abuses of the Patriot Act had ever occurred before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in April of 2005 .
The following may be attributed to Caroline Fredrickson , Director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office :
" Congress has been hoodwinked by the Attorney General and it's time for consequences .
From the US Attorney scandal to warrantless wiretapping , this administration has misled the American people time and again .
We know now that Mr. Gonzales provided false testimony in order to build a case for reauthorization of the Patriot Act .
It is now apparent that Congress and the public simply cannot afford to take anything this administration says about the war on terror at face value .
" Evidently , the Attorney General has shrugged off any obligation he has to protecting the rights of Americans and his brazen attitude has seeped into the Department of Justice he heads .
There is a pervasive and systemic problem within the Justice Department and pinning Mr. Gonzales as the fall guy will not solve it .
Cutting off the head will not kill this beast .
" No government should have these broad powers in the first place and it has become painfully obvious that our government cannot be trusted to police itself .
This administration seems to think that the end justifies the means and when it comes to the means , it 's anything goes .
Without Mr. Gonzales ' false testimony , the Patriot Act may not have been authorized in its current form .
Now , more than ever , is the time to reopen and re-examine the Patriot Act . "
In a related development , Congress has asked the administration for information on the domestic spying program nine times , and has now issued subpoenas to the administration .
The White House must comply by July 18 at 2 p.m. For updates visit www.subpoenawatch.org.

Antiparticles are the mirror image of ordinary particles
Di-positronium , as the new molecule is known , was predicted to exist in 1946 but has remained elusive to science .
Now , a US team has created thousands of the molecules by merging electrons with their antimatter equivalent : positrons .
The discovery , reported in the journal Nature , is a key step in the creation of ultra-powerful lasers known as gamma-ray annihilation lasers .
" The difference in the power available from a gamma-ray laser compared to a normal laser is the same as the difference between a nuclear explosion and a chemical explosion , " said Dr David Cassidy of the University of California , Riverside , and one of the authors of the paper .
" It would have an incredibly high power density . "
As a result , there is a huge interest in the technology from the military as well as energy researchers who believe the lasers could be used to kick - start nuclear fusion in a reactor .
Mirror world
Di-positronium was first predicted to exist by theoretical physicist John Wheeler and its component " atoms " - positronium - were first isolated in 1951 .
These short - lived , hydrogen - like atoms consist of an electron and a positron , a positively charged antiparticle .
Positron Emission Tomography makes use of antiparticles
Antiparticles are the mirror image of ordinary particles .
There is an antiparticle for each type of particle in the Universe .
For example , a positively charged proton has a corresponding negatively charged antiproton .
Conventional thinking states that both antimatter and matter should have been created in equal quantities at the birth of the Universe .
The dominance of matter in our world is one of science 's most enduring mysteries .
Antimatter only makes fleeting appearances in our Universe when high - energy particle collisions take place , such as when cosmic rays impact the Earth 's atmosphere .
They are also made in the lab in particle accelerators such as Europe 's nuclear research facility , Cern .
These appearances are always short lived because antiparticles are destroyed when they collide with normal matter .
The meeting leaves a trace , often as high energy x-rays or gamma-rays .
These emissions are used today in PET ( positron emission tomography ) scanners to study activity in the brain .
Short lives
The transient nature of antiparticles has made creating and studying di-positronium problematic .
" We 've known about this molecule ; we 're not surprised that it exists but it 's taken us more than 50 years to create it in the lab , " said Dr Cassidy .
To make the molecule , Dr Cassidy and his team used a specially designed trap to store millions of the positrons .
A burst of 20 million were then focused and blasted at a porous silica " sponge " .
" It 's like having a trickle of water filling up a bath and then you empty it out and you get a big flush , " said Dr Cassidy .
As the positrons rushed into the voids they were able to capture electrons to form atoms .
Where atoms met , they formed molecules .
" All we are really doing is implanting lot of positrons into the smallest spot we can , in the shortest time , and hoping that some of them can see each other , " said Dr Cassidy .
By measuring the gamma-rays that signalled their annihilation , the team estimated that up to 100,000 of the molecules formed , albeit for just a quarter of a nanosecond ( billionth of a second ) .
Laser beam
Dr Cassidy believes that increasing the density of the positronium in the silicon would create an exotic state of matter known as a Bose - Einstein condensate ( BEC ) .
Bose - Einstein condensate are like a super- atom
BECs are usually produced by supercooling atoms so that they merge and begin to behave like one giant atom .
They have been used in many experiments such as the 2003 Harvard study in which scientists were able to trap light .
" At even higher densities , one might expect the material to become a regular , crystalline solid , " wrote Professor Clifford Surko , of the University of Californian , San Diego , in an accompanying article .
Taking it one step further , scientists could use the spontaneous annihilation of the BEC , and the subsequent outburst of gamma-rays , to make a powerful laser .
" A gamma -ray laser is the kind of thing that if it existed people would find new uses for it everyday , " said Dr Cassidy .
He highlighted an experiment at the National Ignition Facility ( NIF ) in the US where scientists envisage using 192 lasers to heat a fuel target to try to kick - start nuclear fusion .
" Imagine doing that but you no longer need hundreds of lasers , " he said .
Albright : Bush policies on Pakistan are ' incoherent ' David Edwards and Jason Rhyne
Published : Tuesday November 13 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This President Bush has overseen an " incoherent " US policy towards Pakistan , according to former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright , who says that the White House has not acted decisively enough to promote democratic rule in that country .
Appearing on MSNBC's Morning Joe program , Albright told host Joe Scarborough that the current situation in Pakistan , where Gen. Pervez Musharraf has imposed martial law and declared a special emergency rule , is due in part to a serious strategy mistake on the part of the Bush administration .
" I do think that there has been an incoherent policy , " Albright said after being pressed by Scarborough as to whether President Bush 's Pakistan policy was flawed .
The former Clinton administration secretary of state said the US had too largely focused on supporting Gen. Musharraf himself -- and had not done enough to help the Pakistani people achieve a democracy .
" Because clearly we are dependent on [ Musharraf ] , but I think that what has not happened is enough push towards a democratic government there , " she continued .
" That we have just taken for truth everything that Musharraf tells us , and that we should not be in a position where we 're just dependent on this one guy without the support of the people of Pakistan . "
Musharraf suspended the Pakistani constitution on Nov. 3 , fearing the nation 's supreme court would find his recent reelection as president to be illegal .
Former Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto , who survived an Oct. 19 assassination attempt after returning to the country from exile , has called for the increasingly unpopular leader to step down .
" Nobody should underestimate the difficulties of Pakistan , " Albright said earlier in the program , adding that the US was " in this very bad situation where a country that we are quite dependent on on fighting terrorism and dealing with Afghanistan -- which has a nuclear weapon -- is now in a state of disintegration ... "
Previously in the segment , Albright had voiced her support for Sen.
Hillary Clinton in the Democratic presidential primary and outlined how she believed the US could improve is image internationally .
" Well , I think we have to restore our reputation , which has been deeply damaged by Iraq mostly , because we went into a war that we did n't have the proper intelligence on and that certainly has turned out badly , " she remarked .
" I think that what has to happen is the United States does have to be a major power , but I think we need to do things in cooperation with other countries .
Mostly , we have to change the face of America that is viewed publicly , which is a country that is still identified with issues such as Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo . "
Sen. Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) echoed many of Albright 's views on US policy towards Pakistan in a Tuesday blog entry at Huffington Post . " [ W ]e should refocus U.S. assistance to Pakistan so it is more aligned with the needs of the Pakistani people and less with a military leader who has undermined democracy , " wrote Feingold .
" Only a comprehensive foreign policy -- one that moves beyond the administration 's myopic , country - by - country approach -- will make Pakistan , and in turn the U.S. , more secure .
If we fail to take that approach , we will have failed to learn the painful lessons of history and will be bound to repeat them ... "

Wrapping Polyhedra
Another twist on the problem is that the paper may be colored differently on its two sides .
For example , wrapping paper typically has a patterned side and a white side , and kami ( common origami paper ) typically has a colored side and a white side .
If you are wrapping a gift , you probably want only the patterened side of the paper showing .
If you are folding origami , say out of paper that is black on one side and white on the other , you might want to use the two colors to produce a particular effect of colors showing at different places in the shape .
For example , it is possible to fold a single square of paper into a black - and - white checkerboard or a zebra with its stripes .
The above zebra is an origami model designed by John Montroll .
It appears in his book African Animals in Origami , Dover Publications , 1991 , pages 94-103 .
Universality Result
This result was proved by Martin Demaine , Joseph Mitchell , and myself .
We also give three algorithms for optimizing various metrics of the folding .
For example , if we can choose the piece of paper to be a thin rectangle , we can wrap a polyhedron with arbitrarily little wastage of paper : the amount of double coverage can be reduced to as close to zero as desired .
Alternatively , you can specify the locations of the seams ( visible edges or creases of paper ) in the wrapping , according to any decomposition of the faces into convex polygons .
In particular , unless the faces have holes , there are methods for optimizing the number or total length of seams .
( If the faces have holes , some of these problems become NP - complete , while others are conjectured to be NP - complete . )

The latest version appears in Computational Geometry : Theory and Applications ( 2000 ) .
The paper also appears in the Proceedings of the 15th Annual ACM Symposium on Computational Geometry ( 1999 ) , and in the Proceedings of the 3rd CGC Workshop on Computational Geometry ( 1998 ) .
Joseph O'Rourke briefly describes this work in his ``Computational Geometry Column 36 , '' which appears in International Journal of Computational Geometry and Applications , volume 9 , number 6 , pages 615 - 618 ; and SIGACT News , volume 30 , number 3 , issue 112 , September 1999 , pages 35 - 38 .
Optimization
More generally , what is the largest scaling of a given shape that can be wrapped by a given piece of paper ?
The decision version of this optimization problem is , given a desired shape and a piece of paper , can the shape be wrapped by the piece of paper ?
Most of these problems remain open .
Several specific instances have been explored , with conjectured optimal solutions , in Serhiy Grabarchuk 's Wrapping Puzzles .
One version that has been explored more rigorously is wrapping a cube with various rectangles .
Another such variation is disk hiding .
Both of these topics are described below .
Wrapping a Cube
The only instance of wrapping of which I know that has been solved is wrapping a cube with a square .
The solution has been conjectured for a while .
For example , John Conway showed it to me at a conference in 2000 .
A picture of the solution is shown on MathPuzzle and on Juergen Koeller 's Origami Cube page .
That this solution is optimal was finally proved by Michael L. Catalano - Johnson and Daniel Loeb in ``Problem 10716 : A cubical gift , '' American Mathematical Monthly , volume 108 , number 1 , January 2001 , pages 81 - 82 ( posed in volume 106 , 1999 , page 167 ) .
Two interesting variations on the cube - wrapping problem are posed by Henry Larson , in ``Problem 628 : A Cube Pattern Puzzle , '' Journal of Recreational Mathematics , volume 10 , number 2 , 1978 , page 129 .
A rectangular 9 - by - 12 piece of paper can be cut into either a union of six squares ( hexomino ) or into an arbitrary connected polygon , and then that cut - out piece must be folded into the largest cube possible .
Solutions to these puzzles appear in Journal of Recreational Mathematics , volume 11 , number 3 , 1978 , pages 219 - 223 .
The first puzzle was solved by Kenry A. Kierstead , and can be solved by enumeration ; the resulting side length of the cube is around 3.053 .
The second puzzle was solved by Racine Carré with assistance from the poser : there is a way to wrap a cube with surface area arbitrarily close to the area of the rectangle , based on cutting and folding it into a thin strip .
This method works for any rectangle .
Disk Hiding
The initial paper on this problem is ``Hiding Disks in Folded Polygons , '' by Therese Biedl , Martin Demaine , Anna Lubiw , Godfried Toussaint , and myself , which appears in the Proceedings of the 10th Canadian Conference on Computational Geometry .
We distinguish wrappings by how many simple folds they require .
( A simple fold is a fold along a single line . )
For folding a square with 2 , 3 , 4 , or more folds , we give conjectured optimal wrappings of the largest disk , which remain open .
In the following figure , we give the best known ``nontrivial '' foldings with k folds , nontrivial in the sense that they do not approximate the solution for j folds for j < k .
Only the 1 - fold case is known to be optimal .
The conjecture is that 5 folds do not help .
The most interesting general result is when just a single fold along a line is allowed .
What is the largest disk that can be hidden by a single fold of a given polygonal piece of paper ?
If we unfold the hiding and examine the top and bottom copies of the disk , we discover that any such hiding determines two disjoint equal - radius disks packed in the polygonal piece of paper , and vice versa :
Thus , the problem becomes this : what is the largest pair of nonoverlapping equal - radius disks that can be packed into a given polygon ?
We proved that this question can be answered in polynomial time .
Specifically , for convex polygons , our algorithm runs in O ( n2 ) time on a real RAM , and for nonconvex polygons , it runs in O ( n2 ) time multiplied by the number of bits desired in the answer .
( This last part is required for solving degree - 8 polynomial ( monomial ) equations . )
Recently , this problem has been explored in several followup papers .
The references are given below .
For convex polygons , Bose , Czyzowicz , Kranakis , and Maheshwari ( 1998 ) developed a linear - time algorithm , and Kim and Shin ( 2000 ) developed an O( n log n ) - time algorithm .
For simple polygons , Bespamyatnikh ( 1999 ) developed an O( n log3 n ) - time algorithm using parametric search .

A reworked and massively improved MultiMediaCard subsystem was announced for the 2.6.24 kernel release .
SDIO and SPI are about to be supported natively for the first time and will hopefully provide the way for many more drivers .
Pierre Ossman , the MultiMediaCard ( MMC ) subsystem maintainer , announced the new related patches for the Linux kernel almost two weeks ago .
He described the patchset as “ probably … one of the biggest ones for the MMC layer
so far ” and highlighted the SDIO and SPI support as the major improvements .
SDIO
Secure Digital Input Output ( SDIO ) describes a way to use the SD card slot not only for SD cards but also for other devices which are designed for this form factor .
The range of possible applications ranges from GPS receivers over small cameras to network or Wi-Fi adapters :
( Photo taken by Andreas Frank Afrank99 and released under Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike 2.0 ) .
With the new SDIO stack Linux finally has its own stack and is therefore independent from proprietary implementations :
Gone are the days of having to rely on proprietary stacks for SDIO support in Linux .
So no more spotty support for hosts and possible GPL problems .
As a result we can expect better support of the mentioned device types for the future .
But first of course the drivers have to be ported and that will take some time .
This also depends on how well the standard is implemented in the devices .
As Pierre points out this might be a problem and that the driver maintainers have to keep an eye on it .
Still , a set of ported drivers is already ready : sdio_uart is a driver for standarized GPS and UART interfaces ( with the second not tested at announcement time ) , libertas_sdio supports Marvell ’s 8686 Libertas wifi chip and hci_sdio supports standardized bluetooth interfaces .
Especially the first one is aiming at standardized devices which will make it easier to use entire sets of devices .
SPI
With the new Serial Peripheral Interface Bus ( SPI ) support users will now be able to use their SPI controllers for MMC , SD and SDIO .
However , the question if specific hardware is really supported by the new SPI support depends on the quality of the standard implementation in the hardware .
Pierre Ossman has as least one card that does n’t work in SPI mode .
Nice to see that another Linux kernel subsystem is reworked to reach a firm and solid base .
While there is quite some work going on in the graphics world I wonder what the plans for ALSA are .
As a member of the " baby - boomer " generation , I , like at least half of my cohort , have experimented with marijuana in my youth .
Many people , like me , even inhaled it and found it quite enjoyable .
But , these days we are being warned that marijuana is " more dangerous " than ever , and that our youth is in grave danger because today ’s weed is " up to 30 times more powerful " than weed in the 60’s and 70’s .
We ’re being told that we must " protect the children " and that we should join the chorus of voices pounding it into our children ’s heads that " drugs are bad . "
First , I reviewed some of the available " literature " about marijuana .
I found that marijuana contains over 400 chemicals .
That was interesting , but not really useful , as I also have discovered that a single coffee bean contains some 1,200 chemicals , while common tea contains a whopping 4,000 .
Clearly , this was not the real issue .
I learned , and of course remembered , that smoking marijuana caused your eyes to get bloodshot , your mouth to get dry , and your appetite to become insatiable .
Could the modern super - weed make your eyes even redder , or your " cotton - mouth " 30 times as dry ?
Was it possible to get an even more pronounced case of the munchies ?
Curious minds need to know .
Being curious by nature , I knew there was only one way to get to the bottom of the issue : find out for myself .
Since I ’m now a balding middle - aged guy with a beer belly , I knew that getting some marijuana might be quite difficult .
Kids would likely think I was a " narc " or worse yet , I might get caught .
There was only one logical thing to do : go to the marijuana Mecca -- Amsterdam .
I knew that in Amsterdam people could walk into a " coffee shop " and buy marijuana just like any other commodity , and by gosh that ’s exactly what I found .
Upon arriving and checking into my hotel , I walked a few blocks and went into one of the shops .
At the counter I found a menu listing various kinds of weed and hashish that were available .
I told the counter person that I was interested in trying something really strong , and he recommended I try the " White Widow . "
I bought some and sat at a nearby table to smoke it .
The first thing I noticed was that the weed was soft and sticky and gave off an incredible smell .
This was indeed much different than the weed we smoked in the past , which was dry and brown and smelled not much better than dried lawn clippings .
By looks alone , I knew this weed must be " better . "
In the past , the weed we smoked was mostly stems and seeds with a bit of stringy vegetation attached to it , but this weed was devoid of seeds and had virtually no leaf material attached .
I put a little into a pipe and lit it .
I took two or three hits then waited to see what happened .
Holy smokes , this was indeed some very powerful weed !
Way better than anything I had smoked in my past .
Back then , the weed was so crappy , we would often glue several rolling papers together and make a " joint " the size of a cigar just to get high .
No way I was going to try that trick with this weed .
I sat in the coffee shop for a good hour in a state that can only be described as " totally baked . "
After a short while , I left to walk about in the city and stopped in several other shops sampling the wares along the way .
I spent three days in the pot capital of the world and tried many varieties of weed and hashish .
The conclusion I draw from the experience was much the same as the one I drew from my first experience with smoking marijuana : no way this should be illegal .
If you find yourself getting worried about today ’s weed and the " harm " in store for today ’s youth , think back to the days when you were told the same .
Today ’s weed is more powerful , but no matter how hard I tried , I could not smoke myself unconscious .
Do n’t lie to your kids and do n’t swallow the propaganda -- find out for yourself and tell your kids the truth .
The most dangerous thing about today ’s super - weed is the same one we faced in our youth : getting caught .
ARROYO GRANDE , Calif. ( MarketWatch ) --
Yes , America needs a recession .
Bernanke and Paulson wo n't admit it .
And investors hate them .
We 're all trapped in outdated 1990s wishful thinking about a " new economy " and " perpetual growth . "
But the truth is , not only is a recession coming , America needs a recession .
So think positive : Let 's focus on 17 benefits from this recession .
To begin with , recession may be an understatement .
Jeremy Grantham 's GMO firm manages $ 150 billion .
In his midyear report before the credit crisis hit he predicted : " In 5 years I expect that at least one major ' bank ' ( broadly defined ) will have failed and that up to half the hedge funds and a substantial percentage of the private - equity firms in existence today will have simply ceased to exist . "
He was " watching a very slow motion train wreck . "
By October , it was accelerating : " Train hits end of track at full speed . "
Also back in August , The Economist took a hard look at the then emerging subprime / credit crisis :
" The policy dilemma facing the Fed may not be a choice of recession or no recession .
It may be between a mild recession now , and a nastier one later . "
However , the publication did admit that " even if a recession were in America 's long - term economic interest , it would be political suicide " for Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to suggest it .
Then The Economist posed the big question : Yes , " central banks must stop recessions from turning into deep depressions .
But it may be wrong to prevent them altogether . "
Wrong to prevent a recession ?
Why ?
Because recessions are a natural and necessary part of the business cycle .
Remember legendary economist Joseph Schumpeter , champion of innovation and entrepreneurship ?
Economists love Schumpeter 's " creative destruction : " Obsolete firms get destroyed and capital released , making way for new technologies , new businesses , like Google .
And yet , nobody 's willing to apply Schumpeter 's theory to the entire economy ... and admit recessions are a natural part of the business cycle .
Instead , everyone persists in the childlike fairy tale that " all growth is good " and " all recessions are bad , " a bad hangover of the '90s " new economy " ideology .
So for the folks at the Fed , Treasury and Wall Street , " eternal growth " is still America 's mantra .
Unfortunately , the American investors ' brain has also developed this blind obsession with " growth - at - all - costs , " coupled with a deadly fear of all recessions , as if recessions are a lethal super - bug more powerful than Iran with a bomb .
Our values are distorted :
It 's OK to be greedy and overshoot the market on the upside -- grab too many assets , take on too much debt , make consumer spending a religion , live beyond our means , ignite hyperinflation along the way .
Growth is good , even in excess .
And yet , recessions are a no - no that drives politicians , economists and investors ballistic .
Well , folks , you can block all this from your mind , you can argue that recessions are not a part of Schumpeter 's thinking , that they are inconsistent with your political ideology .
But the fact is , we let the housing / credit boom become a massive bubble , it popped and a recession is coming .
So think positive , consider some of the benefits of a recession :
1 . Purge the excesses of the housing boom
No , it 's not heartless .
Not like wartime calculations of " acceptable collateral damage . "
Yes , The Economist admits " the economic and social costs of recession are painful : unemployment , lower wages and profits , and bankruptcy . "
But we can't reverse Greenspan 's excessive rate cuts that created the housing / credit crisis .
It 'll be painful for everyone , especially millions of unlucky , mislead homeowners who must bear the brunt of Wall Street 's greed and Washington 's policy failures .
2. U.S. dollar wake - up call
Reverse the dollar 's free fall and revive our global credibility .
Warnings from China , France , Iran , Venezuela and supermodel Gisele have n't fazed Washington .
Recession will .
3. Write - offs
Expose Wall Street 's shadow - banking system .
They 're playing with $ 300 trillion in derivatives and still hiding over $ 100 billion of toxic off - balance sheet asset - backed securities , plus another $ 300 billion hidden worldwide .
A lack of transparency is killing our international credibility .
Write it all off , now !
4. Budgeting
Force fiscal restraint back into government .
America has been living way beyond its means for years :
A recession will cut back revenues at all levels of government and cutbacks will encourage balanced budgeting .
5. Overconfidence
A recession will wake up short - term investors playing the market .
In bull markets traders ride the rising tide , gaining false confidence that they 're financial geniuses .
Downturns bruise egos but encourage rational long - term strategies .
6. Ratings
Rating agencies have massive conflicts of interest ; they are n't doing their job .
They 're supposed to represent the investors , but favor Corporate America , which pays for the reports .
Shake them up .
7. China
Trigger an internal recession in China .
Make it realize America 's not going into debt forever to finance China 's domestic growth and military war machine .
A recession will also slow recycling their reserves through sovereign funds to our equities .
8. Oil
Force the energy and auto industries to get serious about emission standards and reducing oil dependency .
9. Inflation
Expose the " core inflation " farce Washington uses to sugarcoat reality .
10 . Moral hazard
Slow the Fed from cutting interest rates to bail out speculators .
11 . War costs
Force Washington to get honest about how it 's going to pay for our wars , other than supplemental bills that are worse than Enron - style debt financing .
12 . CEO pay
Further expose CEO compensation that 's now about five hundred times the salaries of workers , compared with about 40 times a generation ago .
13 . Privatization
Stop the privatization of our federal government to no-bid contractors and high - priced mercenary armies fighting our wars .
14 . Entitlements
Force Congress to get serious about the coming Social Security / Medicare disaster .
With boomers now retiring , this problem can only get worse : A recession now could avoid a depression later .
15 . Consumers
Yes , we 're all living way beyond our means , piling up excessive credit - card debt , encouraged by government leaders who tell us " deficits do n't matter . "
Recessions will pressure individuals to reduce spending and increase savings .
16 . Regulation
Lobbyists have replaced regulation .
Extreme theories of unrestrained free trade plus zero regulation just do n't work ; proven by our credit crisis , hedge funds ' nondisclosures , private - equity taxation , rating agencies failures , junk home mortgages , and more .
Get real , folks .
17 . Sacrifice
" We have not seen a nationwide decline in housing like this since the Great Depression , says Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf .
As individuals and as a nation Americans have always performed best in crises , like the Depression or WWII , times when we 're all asked to make sacrifices .
Pampering us with interest - rate cuts and tax cuts during the Iraq and Afghan wars may have stimulated the economy temporarily , but they delayed the real damage of the '90s stock bubble while setting the stage for this new subprime / credit crisis .
Wake up , the train wrecked .
Time to think positive , find solutions , demand sacrifices .
What does symmetry have to do with physics ?
Lie Group Representations
Weights
Final words
Let 's recap : I introduced the idea of symmetry groups , sets of operations that leave something unchanged .
A particular type of group is the Lie group , it 's a group where everything is smooth enough that you can do calculus with them .
I also talked about Lie algebras which you can think of as elements of Lie groups that are infinitesimally close to doing nothing , or as rates of change of elements in a Lie group .
As my ultimate goal is talk about physics , it 's time for a paragraph on that subject , just so we do n't lose sight of where we 're going .
So imagine a game of pool .
Pool is a game of physics , the outcome of any play depends on factors such as friction , collision angles , the coefficient of restitution of the balls ( ie. their bounciness ) and a whole host of other factors .
But despite the complexity of the factors involved , we know that they are invariant under rotation .
What I mean is that if we were to rotate the table and everything on it by some random angle ( eg. from a North - South orientation to a NW - SE orientation ) it makes no difference to the game .
( Well , maybe the floor has a slight tilt , so let 's rotate the room as well if that 's the case . )
If everything is rotated together then you end up with a situation that 's essentially identical .
One of the fundamental principles of physics is that the laws of physics do n't care about the absolute orientation of anything .
We called the set of rotations in a plane SO ( 2 ) so we can summarise this by saying that pool has SO ( 2 ) symmetry .
But does it have SO ( 3 ) symmetry ?
Obviously rotating the table so that it tilts will change the way the game plays out .
But that 's because of an ' accident ' of history , we just happen to be on the surface of the Earth and there 's a gravitational field directed downwards .
But from the point of view of fundamental physics there 's nothing special about ' down ' .
If we were to tilt the pool table and then tilt the entire Earth underneath it , we should still expect to see no change to the physics of pool .
In fact , we get to try this experiment out every day because the entire pool / Earth system rotates through ( approximately ) 360° every day and we do n't notice any change in the way pool tables work .
So pool actually has SO ( 3 ) symmetry , but because of stuff going on in our neighbourhood ( ie. a having a planet under our feet ) , it looks like it only has SO ( 2 ) symmetry .
SO ( 3 ) is a fundamental symmetry of physics , but that fact that on Earth gravity messes this up and leaves us with SO ( 2 ) symmetry is a phenomenon known as symmetry breaking .
More of this later , back to the mathematics .
I 've talked about how groups can act on spaces .
For example SO ( 3 ) acts on 3D space and SO ( 2 ) acts on 2D spaces , ie .
planes .
But there 's some flexibility here and we can decouple the group from the space it acts on .
The way SO ( 2 ) acts on a plane is given by a certain rule .
We can make up new rules and study those .
For example , we could allow SO ( 2 ) to act on 3D space by this rule : rotate your x and y coordinates using the same rule as in the plane , and leave z unchanged .
So if a certain 2D rotation ( ie. a 90 degree rotation ) maps the point ( x , y ) to ( y , -x ) , then according to this new rule it maps ( x , y, z ) to ( y , - x , z ) .
We could make up other rules .
For example we could apply SO ( 2 ) to y and z , and leave x untouched .
In fact , we can make infinitely many rules like this because there are infinitely many axes ( by axis I just mean direction ) we could choose to leave untouched .
We can define a representation to be a rule that takes an element of a group and turns it into a transformation on a space .
We 're interested mainly in what are called linear representations ( I 'll give some justification for this in part 3 ) .
These are representations where the transformations map the origin to the origin , map straight lines to straight lines , and map the midpoints between pairs of points to the midpoints between pairs of points .
It 's not hard to see that rotations do all three of these things .
In fact , as I will only talk about linear representations , I 'll drop the word linear from now on .
I just showed how SO ( 2 ) has multiple representations because of the different ways in can be applied to 3D space .
But we can also define alternative rules for how to apply SO ( 2 ) to the same space , eg. the plane .
Here 's a really simple one called the trivial representation : we simply say that elements of SO ( 2 ) do nothing .
It 's not very interesting , but it is a perfectly valid representation .
Here 's another : apply elements of SO ( 2 ) backwards .
So if we have an element of SO ( 2 ) that says " rotate by 10° clockwise " the backwards rule says " apply a 10 degree rotation anticlockwise " .
It 's a different representation .
But if you look at the plane from underneath , it actually looks just like the original representation .
So even though these are different representations , there 's a sense in which it 's equivalent to the original one .
But here 's a representation of SO ( 2 ) that really is different to the original one :
If the element of SO ( 2 ) says " rotate by x° " we rotate by 2x° instead .
We can think of it as a double - speed rule .
We apply the rotations in SO ( 2 ) twice .
If we run through the elements of SO ( 2 ) starting at 0° and working our way up to 360° , then the representation rotates our space twice as fast and ends up rotating the space twice .
What about a half - speed rule ?
Sounds like it might work .
But it fails for a simple reason .
A 360 degree rotation is the same as a zero degree rotation .
But the half - speed rule says that the former should rotate by 180° and the latter should rotate by 0° .
These are distinct rotations , so our rule does n't make any sense .
As a result we 're restricted to rules that are n- speed rules , where n is an integer .
It 's not hard to see that if we choose n to be a negative integer then by looking at the plane from underneath we get the same rule as using -n , looking from above .
So we can discard the ones corresponding to negative integers .
And we 're left with one rule for each non-negative integer .
In fact , these are all the representations that are possible on a 2D plane .
[ Optional " advanced section " : Now go back to 3D again .
When we apply SO ( 2 ) to 3D space we find that SO ( 2 ) always leaves some axis fixed .
So given a 3D representation of SO ( 2 ) , our 3D space always splits into a 1D space that 's left unchanged , and a 2D space .
You can think of SO ( 2 ) as using the trivial rule on the 1D space , and using any of the rules in the previous paragraph on the 2D space .
Something similar happens in any dimension of space .
The representation of SO ( 2 ) will split up into pieces with some axes left untouched , and others , always grouped in pairs , that transform like in the previous paragraph .
In other words , the representations of SO ( 2 ) can be broken down into fundmental building blocks which we call irreducible representations .
In the previous paragraph I actually classified all of the irreducible representations of SO ( 2 ) .
We can use the properties of SO ( 2 ) to understand other Lie groups .
The idea is that not only is SO ( 2 ) frequently a subgroup of Lie groups , it 's often a subgroup in multiple ways , ie .
there are multiple ways to find a copy of SO ( 2 ) in SO ( 3 ) .
We 've already seen that SO ( 2 ) can be embedded in SO ( 3 ) by interpreting rotations around any fixed axis as elements of a sub - SO ( 2 ) .
But notice how if we find two different embeddings of SO ( 2 ) , they are forced to " interfere " with each other .
For example , let 's choose an SO ( 2 ) that acts on the x-y plane as described above .
Suppose we now pick another SO ( 2 ) subgroup .
No matter how we choose it , it must act on either x or y .
There simply is n't room to find two SO ( 2 ) 's that do n't at some point overlap with each other .
But imagine the group of 4 - dimensional rotations , caled SO ( 4 ) .
( It 's not that scary , it 's just like SO ( 3 ) except that we can make rotations that " mix up " any pair of directions , or combinations of such rotations . )
We could pick one SO ( 2 ) that acts on the x-y plane and another that acts on the z-t plane ( assuming the fourth axis is called 't ' ) .
But we wo n't be able to pick more than two for the same reason as before .
Suppose we pick as many SO ( 2 ) 's as are possible .
Then what we have is whats known as a maximal torus
Here 's a feeble attempt at drawing all of this .
One of the SO ( 2 ) 's inside SO ( 4 ) rotates one pair of axes into each other , the other one rotates the other pair :
Now think about representations of a Lie group .
These are a rule that tell you how each element in the group transforms our space .
As the elements of our SO ( 2 ) subspaces obviously live in the group the rule must apply to these also .
So a representation on a group also gives a representation of all of the SO ( 2 ) 's in it .
So each SO ( 2 ) making up our maximal torus must basicaly act like we described above : by rotating some pairs of axes around at some " speed " and leaving other axes untouched .
So if we pick a maximal torus of a Lie group , any representation splits up into a bunch of pairs of axes and each pair has an integer " speed " associated to each SO ( 2 ) in the maximal torus .
The tuple of " speeds " for each pair of axes is known as a weight .
By interpreting the weights as the coordinates of points , the collection of weights that arise from any particular representation can be drawn in a diagram .
The dimension of the diagram is the number of non-interfering SO ( 2 ) 's in the maximal torus .
And if you want to see what these diagrams look like , Garrett Lisi has some nice ones in his paper .
Note that that paper also contains some " root diagrams " .
I do n't have time to talk about those except to say that ( 1 ) they are weight diagrams for one particular special representation and ( 2 ) they tell you a lot about the geometry of all possible sets of weights for a particular Lie group .
One last thing for the " advanced " section : a similar analysis can be carried out for Lie algebras as opposed to Lie groups .
When physicists draw diagrams of weights they are often talking about the weights of Lie algebras , but these things are intimately related .
There 's probably one important message to take from this section : there are a lot of constraints on representations , you can't just make up any old rule .
So just knowing that a given Lie group acts on some space you already know a lot of information , even if you do n't know what the exact representation is .
BTW
One of the biggest applications of representation theory is in chemistry where you can read off information about the number of electrons allowed in atomic orbitals directly from representations of SO ( 3 ) . ]
That was pretty tough .
Next time I 'll talk about physics and it should get a bit easier .
I 'll explain why much of modern physics is the study of Lie group representations and I'l explain the ' exceptional ' and ' simple ' in the title of Garrett 's paper ( And I apologise for all of my sins of omission .
For example , the analysis above only works for certain types of Lie group and really everything should be done using complex numbers , not real numbers .
But I 'm trying to compress a few hundred pages of mathematics into a single posting . )

We 've seen a couple helmet systems that monitor impacts -- including prototype football helmets -- but Riddell is bringing the tech to market with the Revolution IQ HITS ( Head Impact Telemetry System ) helmet , which contains a system of sensors that stores data about the last 100 impacts , which can later be wirelessly transmitted to a laptop for analysis .
Up to six $ 999 helmets can be linked to each $ 299 HITS receiver , and players and trainers can access data via a web app for later evaluation .
The helmet is shipping now , and apparently the University of Missouri and several other NCAA schools have already placed orders .

Pakistan 's Bhutto Under House Arrest , 5,000 Supporters Rounded Up
The Pakistani information minister says she is free from house arrest .
Nov. 9 , 2007  --
The Pakistani information minister Tariq Azeem Khan said the ' restraining order ' on Pakistani opposition leader Benazir Bhutto had been lifted .
He made the announcement during a an interview broadcast on Sky TV .
He also said he hoped the state of emergency would be lifted ' very soon ' and reiterated the fact that elections would take place by February 15th
Bhutto was placed under house arrest earlier in teh day , and police rounded up 5,000 of her supporters who were planning to hold a protest rally .
Bhutto , the former prime minister of Pakistan who just returned to the country from nearly a decade in exile , called for the rally to protest President Gen.
Pervez Musharraf 's declaration of emergency rule .
" The government has been paralyzed , " Bhutto shouted to supporters across a barbed - wire barricade erected by police , The Associated Press reported .
Earlier President Bush called for Bhutto and her supporters to be freed and again for the end of emergency rule .
It is " crucial for Pakistan 's future that moderate political forces work together to bring Pakistan back on the path to democracy , " the White House said in a statement .
Later after she was unable to leave her house , ABC News reached her by phone " We told the police they should either give us an arrest warrant or allow us to proceed . "
Bhutto said on " Good Morning America . "
" How often can Gen . Musharraf bring the entire public [ to a ] standstill to stop a single public meeting ?
I plead with the international community not to be taken in , for him to retire as army chief , for him to hold elections and to restore the constitution . "
ABC ' Martha Raddatz was outside Bhutto's house when supporters tried to drive Bhutto out of her compound , but said riot police quickly moved in .
Two buses blocked Bhutto's car while she shouted over a megaphone to be released .
Bhutto had hoped to go rally with her supporters .
" Do not raise hands on women .
You are Muslims .
This is un -Islamic , " she shouted .
In front of Bhutto 's compound throughout the day , supporters would come usually one by one .
And one by one they were arrested , Raddatz reported .
The city of Rawalpindie , where the rally was to take place , was in lockdown and there were only sporadic clashes .
Also in Peshawar Friday a suicide bomber struck at the home of the Pakistani minister for political affairs , Amir Muqam .
Four people were killed , but Muqam was not hurt , according to the AP .
There have been waves of bombings in recent months targeting Pakistani officials , which have been blamed on Islamic militants .
It was for this reason Musharraf said he was declaring martial law earlier this week .
But while Musharraf is going after his opposition , ABC News visited an area just 150 miles from where the Taliban is taking over .
The Swat Valley , once a popular tourist site , now has Taliban fighters wielding weapons , closing schools and taking over police stations .
People have fled from here by the hundreds of thousands , fearing the entire valley will fall to the Taliban .
Still many local citizens told ABC News that Musharraf seems more worried about Bhutto than the extremists .
Bhutto , for her part , said she is determined to get out of her compound before day 's end .
ABC 's Martha Raddatz and The Associated Press contributed to this story .
Who got there first ?
Successful tests on a German device manufactured in 1863 were covered up to maintain the Scot 's reputation , the previously unseen files have revealed .
They show the " Telephon " , developed by German research scientist Philipp Reis , could transmit and receive speech .
It is alleged UK businessman Sir Frank Gill was behind the cover-up .
The evidence is contained in files from the archives of the Science Museum in London .
The documents were rediscovered in October by the museum 's curator of communications , John Liffen .
Contract bid
Gill was chairman of Standard Telephones and Cables ( STC ) , the company that conducted the tests on Reis 's ' device .
The company was at the time bidding for a contract from the American Telephone and Telegraph Company , which evolved from the Bell Company .
Gill thought that if word got out of the test results , it would scupper STC 's chances of winning the contract .
Some researchers have argued for many years that Reis beat Bell to the invention of the telephone .
The archived documents seem to support their claims .
A memo , dated 18 March 1947 , from Gerald Garratt , a predecessor of Mr Liffen 's , show STC 's reports on Reis 's device were given to him under the strict condition that they would never be publicly referred to or published without permission .
STC then became anxious to retrieve the documents .
In a subsequent letter , Garratt wrote : " I am left with the thought that there is something so secret about [ the documents ] as to be a matter of first class historic interest .
" You must know as well as I the old controversy : ' Did Bell invent the telephone ? ' and I have here an unpublished manuscript of over 400 pages which proves pretty conclusively that he did n't .
" Does your anxiety to retrieve these reports rather suggest that you agree ? "
In 1955 , LC Pocock , a research scientist in STC 's acoustics laboratory , wrote a letter to Garratt explaining : " [ Frank Gill 's ] decision was that he did n't want the STC name mentioned in any further controversy that may arise as a result of the Reis device . "
The " Telephon " could transmit speech very faintly .
It could receive good quality speech but only at a low efficiency .
" If by telephone , you mean a device that could communicate over any sort of distance , then [ Reis ] did invent the telephone , " said Mr Liffen .
Scottish - born scientist Alexander Graham
Bell is often credited with making the first transmission of speech from one point to another by electrical means in 1876 .
But , as with so many of these " world firsts " , there are competing claims .
Researchers Antonio Meucci and Elisha Gray were also known to be working on speech transmission devices at the same time as Bell and Reis .
Light bulb recycling made easy for Londoners
There ’s good news for Londoners wishing to recycle their old light bulbs , both incandescent and energy saving .
Ryness Lighting and Electrical have taken it upon themselves to educate London residents about the dangers of not disposing of light bulbs safely .
Currently the majority of used light bulbs go to landfill sites , where glass and metal go to waste .
More importantly energy saving light bulbs must be recycled as they contain sodium and mercury , which are hazardous materials .
If dumped in household waste and allowed to enter our landfill sites the mercury in particular can seep into out drinking water and the habitat around it .
The mercury from a single fluorescent tube is enough to pollute 30,000 litres of water beyond the safe drinking level in the UK .
As London ’s only lighting and electrical company we feel that it is our duty to let our customers know the potential harm that is being done to the environment , and offer a service which will allow you act ethically without added hassle or charge .
Effective immediately , Ryness will recycle any of your old light bulbs for free .
Just bring your old light bulbs into any Ryness store and they will ensure that they are all correctly disposed of .
If you shop with them online , Ryness will arrange a collection of your used light bulbs from your home .
You can find out more about this by emailing [ email protected ]

Oct. 26 , 2007  --
For those Americans so inclined , rest assured : A federal appeals court has just made it easier to take naked pictures of yourself and post them on the Internet .
The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati earlier this week ruled that a federal anti-child pornography law , the Child Protection and Obscenity Enforcement Act , violates the First Amendment .
The law required " producers " and distributors of certain sexually explicit pictures and films to keep detailed records of the names and ages of their subjects and allow the government to inspect those records .
The court 's ruling , which held that the law restricted constitutionally protected speech , is likely to be a boon to the online pornography industry , which has lately seen the rise of YouTube - inspired sites , such as YouPorn and PornoTube , which feature amateur , user - generated photos .
" This law had really huge implications for the adult entertainment industry and , really , for any consenting adult couple who took nude photos of themselves , " said Clay Calvert , co-director of the Pennsylvania Center for the First Amendment at Pennsylvania State University .
Charles Miller , a spokesman for the Department of Justice , said the government had not decided whether it would appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court .
" We are disappointed in the court 's ruling , " Miller said .
" The statute was enacted to protect those who are underage from being used as performers in sexually explicit media . "
The case was brought by Connection Distributing Co. , which publishes a swingers ' magazine that featured sexually explicit photographs of couples who want to meet other couples .
Connection argued that the law , which carried up to five years in prison for violations of its record - keeping requirements , would deter readers from buying the ads .
The court agreed , saying the law , though designed to stop child pornography , would " chill " constitutionally protected speech .
The statute defines a " producer " of pornography as anyone who makes certain kinds of sexually explicit material .
" To appreciate why speech would be chilled , consider the following , " Judge Cornelia Kennedy wrote in the majority opinion .
" A couple wishes to take photographs of themselves engaging in sexual activity .
To do so means compiling records , affixing statements , maintaining such records for at least five years and opening their property up for visitation by government officials to inspect the records . "
The ruling , which applies in Ohio , Kentucky , Tennessee and Michigan , has particular resonance for what Calvert called a " new frontier " of adult content — user - generated pornography Web sites , which usually sell advertising rather than subscriptions .
While pornographic DVD sales continue to fall , the Web site YouPorn , for example , now ranks as one of the Top 100 most visited Web sites , according to Alexa , which tracks Internet traffic .
" The adult industry is latching onto the Web 2.0 banner just like mainstream sites are , " said Frederick Lane , author of " Obscene Profits : The Entrepreneurs of Pornography in the Cyber Age . "
" This ruling will make it much easier for adult sites to use a user - driven Web site model . "
Until now , he said , the statute " was a pretty large club hanging over their heads . "
On a recent visit to New York City , the weather was cold and crisp .
On such days , my husband ( David ) and I always share a small brown bag full of freshly roasted chestnuts from one of the street vendors who seem to be on every other NYC street corner .
After letting the chestnuts cool down for a few minutes , David always peels these delightful treasures so I do n’t have to take my mittens off !
They are so rich , sweet and tender !
When I saw fresh chestnuts at the grocery store , I thought it would be great to roast some at home for startcooking .
For comparison sake , I bought a jar of pre-packaged chestnuts as well .
Before I begin , I would like to point out that Water Chestnuts are from an aquatic plant and are a totally different food than the chestnuts ( from a tree ) that I am about to roast .
To Roast Chestnuts :
Preheat your oven to 425 degrees F .
Wipe the chestnuts off with a damp towel and set them on a cutting board , flat side down .
With a small , sharp knife cut an X in each chestnut .
( There are special chestnut - X - cutting knives that you can buy – see comments below .
I would only recommend buying one of these knives if you roast a TON of chestnuts . )
The X allows the steam to escape while they are cooking .
( Do not omit this step , otherwise the chestnuts could explode in the oven ! )
This will also make peeling a lot easier .
For safety sake , you may feel more comfortable cushioning the chestnut on a ( clean ) dish towel to cut the X .
Put the chestnuts in a baking pan with the X facing up .
It will take 20 - 30 minutes to roast the chestnuts .
When cooked , the shells will burst open , and the chestnut will be golden brown .
The tricky part is actually knowing when they are done .
If you over - cook OR under - cook them , they will get hard and the inner skin will be very difficult to remove .
Now comes the hard part : peeling them !
You need to peel them while they are still warm .
Let them cool just enough so that you can touch them , then start peeling .
Be very careful not to burn your fingers !
Be sure to buy extra , because once they are open you may well discover that some have actually turned bad and are not edible .
This task is not as easy as David makes it look .
My thumb is killing me !
So now comes the test : comparing the fresh chestnuts to the ones from the jar .
There are four things to consider :
Appearance Taste and Texture Price Convenience
Freshly Roasted ( on the left ) Vs. From a Jar
1. Appearance
First let me say that the chestnuts I bought from Whole Foods did not end up looking at all like the magnificent ones from the street vendor .
( Of course the 7 or 8 chestnuts from the street vendor that actually end up in your brown bag do n’t look like the ones they have on display either ! )
The ones from the jar have a preserved look about them .
2. Taste and Texture
They both tasted delicious but the ones from the jar actually had a moister texture .
3. Price
The 17 fresh chestnuts from Whole foods cost $ 4.67
I ended up with 12 usable ones .
( Yes there are only 11 in the above photo because I ate one ! )
Two I could not get peeled , two disintegrated when I tried to peel them and one was rotten .
The 7.4 ounce jar cost $ 8.99 .
100 % were usable .
4. Convenience
When I was a kid , whenever my mom would bake , we would always have to shell the walnuts .
( Way back then ! )
It was significantly cheaper to buy unshelled walnuts .
It is a very labor intensive activity .
Today , having to shell your own nuts sounds like it is on par with having to go milk the cow to get fresh milk !
Peeling your own chestnuts is not an easy task !
Conclusion :
All in all , my first preference is to buy them off the street vendor in NYC .
ONLY as a special treat , is it worth the effort to roast the chestnuts yourself .
The look , the taste and the aroma is wonderful .
BUT , for use in a recipe , I would probably skip roasting them myself and just buy the jar !
Cheers !

10 Creative ways to cut up your credit cards
Readers of Gather Little by Little know that I prefer a lifestyle without credit cards and that I ’m a huge advocate of cutting up credit cards if you are n’t disciplined enough to use them wisely ( like me ) .
How do I define “ disciplined ” ?
You are disciplined if you pay off your balance monthly and have no credit card debt .
I debated writing a serious article , but instead decided to have a little fun .
So to help inspire you to cut up your credit cards , here are 10 creative ways you can cut up your credit cards :
# 10 – Scissors
This is probably the most popular but most boring way to cut up your credit cards .
All you need is : well , a pair of sharp scissors and all of your credit cards .
Cut along the length of the card .
Cut it at least twice , once through the magnetic strip on the back and next through the account number .
I also found these neat hand shredder ’s which look like a good option as well , especially since the picture shows them being used on a Chase card !
# 9 – Shredder
Next up is the paper shredder .
This option causes a great deal more noise and is more fun than scissors .
It ’s nice to see that card shredded into small bits of plastic .
Be careful though , not all shredders are made to shred plastic , so read the manual .
Mine has a special slot just for credit cards and CDs further emphasizing this must be a popular option .
# 8 – Hatchet or Ax
Using a sharp hatchet or ax is another option .
This of course requires a little more strength and I would suggest you be outside .
All you need is some like a log or stump to place the card (s ) on and swing away !
# 7 – Blow Torch
Nothing better than watching you credit card catch on fire and melt away .
It ’s a great way of “ sticking it to d’man “ .
You ’ll need something to hold the card .
I ’d suggest a small metal vice .
Light the torch and burn away !
# 6 – Chainsaw
Oh yeah , nothing like the sound of a chainsaw to put fear into the eyes of those pesky little credit cards .
Tape or mount your credit card to a log or stump , hold the chainsaw correctly and let it rip .
Now is that manly or what ???
# 5 – Blender
The blender will absolutely tear your credit card to itsy bitsy pieces .
If you want to see the results before you do it , check out this video .
The more cards you have , the better the effect !
I love how they let their little boy put the cards in .
We let our kids shred our cards in the shredder .
# 4 – Sledge Hammer or Hammer
You know all of that built up frustration and anger you ’ve had with yourself and the credit card companies ?
Now you can finally take it out on your card .
Find a hard non-breakable surface and beat that credit card into smithereens .
Give it a good whack for me !
# 3 – Give it to your dog
Our golden retriever absolutely loves to tear apart plastic .
So if your dog is anything like ours , turn your credit card into a chew toy .
Not only will you dispose of your credit card , but your dog will have a blast .
Just make sure he / or she does n’t take off to the pet store with it .
# 2 Hole puncher
You know as well as I do that credit card company has been taking one notch at a time out of your finances … sometimes even a big notch .
Here ’s your chance to notch them back .
Turn that credit card into little dots and throw some confetti !
# 1 Shoot it
Take your card down to the local shooting range , mount it on a target and have a blast .
This is the ultimate way to dispose of your credit card and vent a little of that built up tension .
For added effect , use a shot gun .
Disclaimer : Please use extreme caution when doing any of the above suggestions and you do them at your own risk … so be careful !

Why and How " The Global War On Terror " Is A Lie
by ron corvus
Unfortunately , most Americans believe in prosecuting the " Global War On Terror . "
The MSM has beat it into the hearts and minds of Americans non-stop , 24/7/365 since 9/11 .
Even the most so - called " liberals " believe in prosecuting the " Global War On Terror . "
Hillary Clinton , Barack Obama , John Edwards , Ted Kennedy , John Kerry , etc. , all rightfully bash Bush , but snap to attention instantly when anyone charges them : " Do you want to win this ' War On Terror ? '
Or not ?
Do you want al Qaeda to win the ' Global War On Terror ? ' "
Hillary , Obama and Edwards ALL bash Bush and his warmongering self , but gladly and dutifully support the unlawful , unconstitutional Bush Doctrine of pre-emptive strikes and subsequent military occupations .
All the Republican candidates and Hillary , Obama and Edwards believe the U.S. government has the exclusive right to execute unprovoked , unilateral military strikes against anyone who the U.S. government deems a " terrorist threat . "
This is a bi-partisan belief amongst all politicians - but the glue that holds them together are the following lies :
1. ) 9/11 was an unprovoked attack on the U.S .
2. ) The 9/11 hijackers attacked us because they hate our freedoms , hot dogs , apple pies and Chevrolets ;
3. ) If we do n't attack them over there , we 'll have to fight them over here ;
It is this virtual " See and Say " of myopic beliefs which drive our nation further into conflict and war profiteering .
I believe it is essential that Americans realize 9/11 was NOT an unprovoked attack , but rather a very much provoked attack .
The MSM should n't even call it 9/11 anymore ; they should call it , " What goes around , comes around . "
Americans are led to believe the U.S. government 's role in 9/11 is as innocent as Snow White - nothing could be further fom the truth .

Howard Knopf reports that the Federal Court of Appeal took just 24 hours to render its decision in the iPod levy case , quashing the Copyright Board of Canada 's decision to certify a tariff on iPods .
It was clear during yesterday 's hearing that the court reacted favourably toward the argument that this case covered the same terrain as its 2004 decision that rejected the iPod levy .
Howard quotes the court as stating that
I read that case as authority for the proposition that the Copyright Board has no legal authority to certify a tariff on digital audio recorders or on the memory permanently embedded in digital audio recorders .
That proposition is binding on the Copyright Board . . .
While this kills the application of the private copying levy to iPods ( subject to a possible appeal by the CPCC ) , it also means that Canadians who copy music from their CDs to their iPods are not covered by the exception and thus arguably infringe copyright .
The issue therefore moves from the Federal Court of Appeal to Industry Minister Jim Prentice who must decide whether he will amend the law by creating a clear , uncompensated exception to format shift ( as the United Kingdom has just proposed ) or leave millions of Canadians in legal limbo .
( CNN ) -- Republican presidential candidates seeking a win in South Carolina 's primary -- and an edge in what so far has been a wide - open race -- were hoping voters would head to the polls despite bad weather .
Voters hurry through the rain to cast ballots Saturday at a senior center in Bluffton , South Carolina .
Rain and snow were falling in some places Saturday .
CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras said as much as 4 inches of snow could fall in the western and northern parts of the state .
Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee , who was victorious earlier this month in Iowa caucuses , said the snow was " something we hoped would n't happen . "
But , Huckabee said , " We have to take the weather for what it is .
We do n't get to choose it .
I just hope that our voters are so committed that it does n't affect the fact that they are going to vote , because ... it 's a mission that they have to deal with today . "
Malfunctioning voting machines plagued Horry County , which contains the cities of Myrtle Beach and North Myrtle Beach .
" Human error " put the machines offline in 80 percent of the county 's precincts during Saturday 's voting , according to county spokeswoman Lisa Bourcier
By 4 p.m. ET , only about four of the county 's 118 precincts were without a working machine , Bourcier said .
Polls closed at 7 p.m. ET .
The campaign of GOP contender Sen .
John McCain had sought to obtain a court order to extend voting in the northeastern county by an additional hour but were unable to do so .
McCain did very well in Horry County when he ran for president in 2000 .
Bourcier said that voters in the affected precincts used paper ballots and any scrap of paper available to cast their votes .
She said the county was bringing in 40 to 50 extra people to count ballots after polls close , and , she said , officials were aware that an order extending voting hours was possible .
Bourcier said the problem was caused by " human error . "
The last step in preparing the machines for Election Day is a " clearing " test that resets the machine data to zero .
That test was not done on most of the machines , which locked them and made them unable to function , she said .

Katon Dawson , chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party , said that he had confidence the problem was being fixed .
" We expect a full and fair count , " Dawson said in a telephone interview with CNN .
" In South Carolina , our citizens take the right to vote very seriously .
We have full confidence in our state elections commission , which is running this primary .
Any questions that have arisen are being addressed . "
He noted that " there is always a backup in case there is an election machine malfunction and a ballot can't be cast . "
Historically , the path to the GOP presidential nomination has gone through South Carolina , which relishes its role of being the political gateway to the South .
Residents like to point out that no one since Ronald Reagan has reached the White House without a South Carolina win .
" South Carolina is the state where the Republican base passes judgment on the candidates , " CNN senior political analyst Bill Schneider said .
" If conservatives are going to rally behind any single contender , we 'll see that happen in South Carolina . "
South Carolina 's Democratic presidential primary will be held on Saturday , January 26 .
As of around 11 a.m. , about 140 people had turned out to vote in the Seven Oaks precinct of Lexington County , South Carolina .
Some of them , however , complained about phone calls earlier in the week from campaigns .
" It 's a little much , " said Kay Burns , who said she voted for Sen.
John McCain of Arizona because " I like what he stands for . "
Others said they voted for Huckabee .
" I like the fact he 's a Christian , " said voter Stacee Groome .
Kay Burns ' husband , Ellus , said he voted for former Sen.
Fred Thompson of Tennessee because of his " presentation , maturity and Reaganism . "
Burns said the most important issues for him are the economy and international relations .

Should a company let its people telecommute ?
Is it good or bad for productivity ?
Does working from home make employees more stressed because it blurs the boundary between work and private life ?
Or is it good for families because it cuts down on time commuting and gives people more time at home ?
And is it true that most of the employees who work from home do so in the nude ?
Pennsylvania State University have just published a meta-study that looks at these questions .
It ’s called “ The Good , the Bad , and the Unknown About Telecommuting : Meta -Analysis of Psychological Mediators and Individual Consequences . ”
Catchy , huh ?
The study analyzes the results of 46 other studies on telecommuting involving a total of 13.000 employees .
The overall conclusion ?
Telecommuting is good for both employees and for the workplace .
You can find the whole study here ( pdf ) .
Main findings
Here are the findings that struck me as being the most interesting .
For some reason , the study completely neglected to look at the nude / clothed aspect of telecommuting .
On that one , your guess is a good as mine .
1 : Telecommuting gives employees a sense of freedom at work
In other words , you feel that you have more control over your work environment .
In fact , this turned out to be the root cause of many of the other effects found in the study .
2 : Telecommuting is good for the family
A lot of people fear that telecommuting harms family life because it blurs the boundary between work and private life and pressures people to work when they ’re at home .
This study found that the opposite is true and that telecommuting reduced conflicts between work and family .
From the study :

3 : Working from home 1 or 2 days a week does not harm relations to co-workers or managers
However , working from home 3 days had a positive effects on the family , but also had a negative effect on workplace relationships .
The study also says that managers must adapt to accommodate telecommuting , or it wo n’t work :
4 : Telecommuting makes employees more productive
The study looked at both self - perceived efficiency and how efficient managers thought their telecommuting employees were .
And while employees themselves did not feel more productive , the study did find a positive link between telecommuting and the manager ’s rating of employees ’ efficiency .
The study also looked for signs that spending less time in the office would harm employees ’ career expectations by giving them less time to demonstrate value to managers .
The study found no indication of this .
5 : Telecommuting makes people happier at work
There was a positive link between telecommuting and job satisfaction .
The study also showed that employees who can work from home are less likely to quit .
My take
All of these findings make a lot of sense to me , and it just underlines what I always say :
Who knows better than you , when and where you do your best work ?
I ’ve always assumed that the employees of any given company are responsible adults , capable of making decisions for themselves .
If they ’re not , why were they hired in the first place ?
The great thing about this study is that it clearly suggests that even though the effects may not be huge huge , telecommuting is good for both employees and for the workplace .
Your take
What about you ?
Do you work from home ?
Would you like to ?
How would working from outside the office a few days a week affect you ?

Life changes .
That is probably the only thing that is certain when it comes to life and lifestyles .
When the Internet was in its early days , probably
The march was not initially planned but it rose out of our decision recently to adopt more acts that resemble or are acts of “ direct action . ”
The recent protests in Olympia , Washington , where young activists are disrupting shipments to the military base , the violence against activists at the “ No Borders Camp ” on its last day , the Morton West students , and our own incident surrounding the arrests of three protesters during the Oct 27th march have brought us together in more solidarity than ever before .
We are now growing into a power governments cannot suppress and are reaching a level that students were at during the Vietnam War .
Following the march , we held a rally where I stood up and spoke .
I wrote out something lengthy , which I will publish here .
When you get up in front of people , you start to speak and realize you are preaching to the choir and wonder if you should be wasting your voice .
I went on for about two or three minutes but in the cold evening in Chicago and in the heat of the moment , I left out what had led me to this point .
I did n’t really know until last night how I got to where I am today , but I have managed to figure out my biography is the story of an optimistic bookish peaceful loving boy that has met betrayal and become greatly disappointed lately .
I am not frustrated ; in fact , faced with an increasing fascist state , I have become a person who is constantly looking within himself for that creativity needed to take on the powers that be .
I do feel let down as everyone has felt in their life .
Having found a few political leaders I can trust whose time is now and who should be rising to lead America with support from Americans , I am frustrated that people are n't searching for solutions as vigorously as me .
It would be all too easy to demand an end to capitalism and join an anarchist movement but that ’s not where I stand on America .
I believe in democracy and I like the power of the people .
I have followed Democrats closely over the years and I have followed the crimes and misdemeanors of the Bush administration obsessively over the past seven years .
And I have an idea of where Americans stand , and we will not be abandoning what our " Founding Fathers " instituted anytime soon .
And why should we ?
I owe much gratitude to Bush & Co. for making me the activist and political thinker that I am today .
Had they not inspired me to react , I would be a sarcastic tranquil man just pursuing film for his own personal gain .
Since Bush 's rise to power and relentless grabbing of power that has been met with little or no opposition , I have read over 100 books on the Bush administration , liberals , democrats , party politics , U.S. foreign policy , American history , people ’s history , and imperialism / fascism / civil rights .
It has been eye - opening and earth shattering to my life .
As Henry David Thoreau said , “ A truly good book teaches me better than to read it .
I must soon lay it down , and commence living on its hint .
What I began by reading , I must finish by acting . ”
Great people 's books have taught me well ( Zinn , Chomsky , Palast , Moore , etc. )
Even several comedians ( Jon Stewart , Bill Maher , Lewis Black , George Carlin ) have had a profound impact on my mind .
I have now made it my mission to fight for regime change here at home the same way Bush & Co. has fought for regime change in the Middle East .
This regime begins in three ways : through civic associations ( which is why I have been joining and dedicating my time to as many groups as possible seeking to raise awareness on issues and politics ) , regime - busting protest movements ( which is why I marched today and would consider traveling to Washington , D.C. for a future protest ) , and through supporting the transformation of mainstream parties or the creation of third parties ( which is why I support Dennis Kucinich for President and if I had conservative inclinations , I would support Ron Paul and I also am following the Green Party closely hoping they beat many of these weak , spineless , hapless , gutless Democrats who are doing nothing but getting in the way of regime change in America ) .
America needs impeachment of Bush and Cheney but regime change does not just stop there .
Regime change means “ no democracy lite . ”
As Charles Derber puts it in “ Regime Change Begins at Home , ” we must tear down five pillars : transnational corporations ( which turn us from active citizens into entertained passively managed brainwashed consumers ) , corpocracy ( which turns Washington , D.C. over to corporate raiders to run our government for profits ) , social insecurity ( which forces most of us to spend our days running in place just to survive , anxious about whether we can pay the bills , get affordable housing and health care , and afford retirement ) , empire ( which builds American military power while undermining relations with our allies , breeding more hatred of Americans around the world , decreasing our national security ) , and the corporate mystique ( which promotes ideology of freedom but robs us of the values and capacity to escape our condition as servants of the corporate order ) .
We must erect in the place of the five pillars we tear down five new pillars : an active citizen ’s network ( where ordinary citizens turn the wheels of democracy in communities and in D.C. ) , a new democracy ( where ordinary people run the show ) , real social security ( where tenants get ownership and legal protection ) , collective security ( where Americans create a neighborhood association with all countries of the world abandoning imperialist ambitions ) , and citizen empowerment ( where the America walks its freedom talk ) .
Can this really happen you say ?
It has to happen .
I probably have more hope than anyone but that is because I know I will be fighting this until the bitter end and making a career out of covering our taking back of America .
Evidence in history proves that if we the people of America fight we can win .
Our grassroots movements have time and time again kept democracy alive .
The American tradition is founded in a Declaration of Indepedence and Constitution that advocate for this regime change in America .
And let ’s face it , we need regime change for selfish reasons and should not be afraid to stand up for our interests ( jobs , health care , education , housing , our environment , poverty , and an end to war and racism ) .
An end to war as we know it is upon us and within reach but will not be achieved without fighting and utilizing the civil liberties that as Americans we are all entitled to .
We must invest and support leaders who wish to throw off the ties that bind us .
We must put our money where our mouth is .
We must buy responsibly and avoid irresponsible products that contribute to the militarization and pollution of America .
We must find ways to not be reckless consumers .
And we must not let the bleak midwinter drive us indoors and into hiding at a time when the U.S. government we live under is more dangerous , imperialistic , complicit , and silent in their actions and inactions every day .
As Bush & Co. leave office and corporate money shifts the pendulum of democracy from one side to the other , it is the American people who must defend the future of America .
With a Democrat taking office ( presumably unless the Democratic nominee runs a pitiful campaign and loses to Giuliani ) , we face a situation even worse than when Bush was in power because Americans trust Democrats to bail us out after Bush leaves office .
A wave will come crashing down upon them when they realize that the DLC and other Democrats have been co-conspirators with the Bush administration all along .
Having supported a co-conspirator ( John Kerry ) , I now am in the right place ( supporting Dennis Kucinich , the sole power behind impeachment and the sole voice standing up to the DLC ) .
In the words of Martin Luther King Jr. :
We will not build a peaceful world by following a negative path .
It is not enough to say we must not wage war .
It is necessary to love peace and sacrifice for it .
We must concentrate not merely on the negative expulsion of war but on the positive affirmation of peace .
We must see that peace represents a sweeter music , a cosmic melody , that is far superior to the discords of war .
Somehow , we must transform the dynamics of the world power struggle from the negative nuclear arms race , which no one can win , to a positive contest to harness humanity 's creative genius for the purpose of making peace and prosperity a reality for all the nations of the world .
In short , we must shift the arms race into a peace race .
If we have a will - and determination - to mount such a peace offensive , we will unlock hitherto tightly sealed doors of hope and transform our imminent cosmic elegy into a psalm of creative .
" Who can be serene in a country where both the rulers and the ruled live without principle ? " ( Henry David Thoreau , Civil Disobedience )
Let us defend this dear country of ours in the name of peace and freedom for a better future in America .

A young mother was told to leave a college study group along with her sleeping baby - because she was a health and saftey risk .
Liz Cooper , 25 , and five - month - old Dominca Jimenez , were at an evening group study session in the college 's library and IT room when security staff asked her to leave .
The mother - of - two , who is studying in the evening for a degree in early years health , was told the decision was made on health and safety grounds because of dust , temperature and hard - edged surfaces .
Ms Cooper , from Darwen , Lancs , said staff at St Mary 's College in Blackburn had supported her when she was pregnant and had told her she could take the baby in with her for short periods .
But now she said she had been been told that she can only have Dominica with her in the breast - feeding room or the baby - changing facilities .
Sarah Flanagan , spokeswoman for the college , said the decision was made on health and safety grounds .
Scroll down for more ...
Ms Cooper said : " The breast - feeding facilities are all well and good , but if I can't take her onto the rest of the site , what is the point ?
I 'm not going to take her to college just to feed her .
" It 's not as if I was in a lecture at the time , it was a small study group .
The college accommodates people will all sorts of disabilities and other learning needs , so why not mums ?
" The college is saying that the problem is health and safety , because of dust , temperature and hard - edged surfaces , but that 's exactly the same as you would find in a supermarket at home or anywhere else , so I do n't see the problem .
" She was asleep and quiet and I was carrying her in a sling so she was n't disturbing anyone .
If she had woken up and cried I would have immediately left the room .
" I was very embarrassed and upset - they called me away from my group and asked me to leave .
It was absolute madness and I was made to feel like a criminal .
" I was working in a group of four people and there were only another four people there - they were n't being disturbed either .
" It seems like I have to be either a student or a mum and I can't be both . "
Ms Cooper usually leaves the baby with her partner Fior Angel Jimenez while she is in classes .
She said she would now have to find babysitters every time she needed to use the library for quick pieces of work and her husband was unavailable , disrupting the little girl 's routine .
Zara Guest , who was studying with Ms Cooper , said : " Dominica was asleep in her sling and not causing any trouble .
It 's a real shame that they reacted like that .
" They should use a bit of common sense - there was no - one about . "
The spokeswoman said Ms Cooper had been given permission to take Dominica into college with her for short visits , but guidance from the Health and Safety Executive meant they could not allow the baby in the library or other areas .
She said : " We are also conscious of the noise disruption that a baby may inadvertently cause to these study areas .
" Liz was given the opportunity to finish her task at the computer and then left .
" We are confident that our reception and Higher Education staff have behaved with the utmost professionalism and are disappointed that Elizabeth feels otherwise .
" Earlier this week we wrote to Elizabeth to reaffirm our offer of breastfeeding facilities and invited her to discuss this matter with the principal , Kevin McMahon . "
Cllr Maureen Bateson , a former chairman of Blackburn and Darwen 's children 's services committee , said the college should be more flexible and come up with a compromise .
" I sympathise with Ms Cooper - I know it 's difficult to juggle motherhood and studies and I hope the college can find some better way of working with her , " she said .
It should come as no surprise that Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City is still viewed as a presidential savior in 2008 .
Despite his disclaimers , the mayor remains a lively talking point .
Just look at his landing on the cover of Newsweek .
His moves from Democrat to Republican to independent seem to endear him only more to the pundits .
His huge fortune does n't hurt either for a public official who gets things done efficiently in an often dysfunctional city .
During his tenure , Bloomberg has been able to operate without scandal and has quietly served his constituents well , according to nearly every source .
Why the Bloomberg phenomenon ?
Consider the front - runners of the two major parties .
For the Republicans , Rudy Giuliani continues to amaze .
His endorsement by Pat Robertson makes them the prominent odd couple of the campaign so far .
A few years ago , Rudy would have most likely denounced Robertson as a near nutcase .
Then comes the case of Bernard Kerik , Rudy 's police commissioner when he has mayor and later his business partner .
According to a federal indictment last week , Kerik is a white - collar criminal .
If his trial comes during a campaign with Rudy as the GOP nominee , it wo n't be helpful .
Still , Giuliani tops the Republican field as a defender of gay rights , abortion rights , and gun control .
Conservatives can be difficult to figure when they embrace his record .
On the Democratic side , Sen. Hillary Clinton does not wear well in a book by author Sally Bedell Smith .
Clinton comes across as a mercurial figure — domineering , secretive , scheming , often angry , and , of course , ambitious .
Forget the ambition because most politicians are that way .
But Smith 's portrayal of Clinton is disquieting .
Some of her traits are troublesome for a potential president .
And she is far ahead in her party while Rudy still has a fight on his hands in the GOP .
If the voters decode in a few months that it will be Rudy vs. Hillary , that third New Yorker Michael Bloomberg may hear the call .
Third - party candidates have done poorly in the nation 's history , but this could be different .
For journalists , it would be a great story to cover .
Alleged Halliburton gang rape survivor says she was given ' special drink ' David Edwards and Jason Rhyne

The former Halliburton / KBR employee accusing the company of attempting to cover up her gang - rape in Iraq is now speaking out about her ordeal -- saying she felt " imprisoned " after reporting the incident , and was told by her superiors to keep quiet or lose her job .
Appearing in an interview with ABC's Brian Ross , Jamie Leigh Jones spoke about what she describes as horrifying circumstances surrounding her rape and it's aftermath as handled by officials at KBR , a then - subsidiary of private security contractor Halliburton .
" I was worried about being in a war zone .
I was worried about insurgency , " said Jones , who did n't anticipate danger from her own coworkers .
But on her fourth night in a Green Zone barracks in Baghdad , Jones says she accepted a " special drink " from male KBR employees .
" Then I do n't remember anything at all after that , " she said .
" I woke up naked , I was bruised .
And then when I sat on the toilet , that 's when I realized my inner thighs were very bruised and I was bleeding pretty bad .
And then I knew I had been raped . "
After a US Army medic confirmed that she had been raped by multiple men , Jones says she was placed under armed guard in a metal shipping container -- outfitted with a bed and a sink -- and told to keep quiet about the rape or lose her job .
" I felt imprisoned , " she told Ross .
" I was n't able to call my parents until one of the KBR guards felt sorry for me and let me call . "
Ross reports that no investigation is currently underway in the case .
The Crime Victims Office at the Department of Justice indicates it has closed it's probe of the rape , citing a lack of jurisdiction over the private contractors in Iraq .
" It 's a boys will be boys culture , " said Jones ' attorney , Todd Kelly .
" The men who are there believe they live without laws , they live without restrictions . "
Jamie Leigh Jones talks to ABC about being raped while working for Halliburton in Baghdad .

The bill has to be signed into law by Mayor Ebrard
The local assembly voted unanimously in favour of the bill enabling patients living in the city to suspend treatment if it only prolongs life .
Family members of terminally ill people who are paralysed but can express themselves can also sign the order if two witnesses are present .
The bill still has to be signed into law by Mayor Marcelo Ebrard .
It could still be the subject of a legal challenge in this conservative Catholic country .
However , Hugo Valdemar , a spokesman for the Archdiocese of Mexico , told El Universal newspaper that the Catholic Church had no issues with the measure , which only applies to Mexico City .
But Mr Valdemar added that the Church was concerned that the bill could be a first step towards legalising euthanasia , which he said would be unacceptable .
Liberal laws
The measure allows " death without unnecessary suffering when death is inevitable " said assembly member Victor Hugo Cirigo .
It states that under no circumstances could drugs be supplied which could cause the death of a patient .
Patients wishing to forgo treatment would have to sign a release before a public notary indicating their desire to stop treatment .
Immediate family members would make the decision for minors and mentally impaired patients .
Health workers could declare themselves conscientious objectors and opt out of treating patients who decide not to lengthen their lives .
The bill also allows patients to specify if they want to donate organs .
The left - wing congress in Mexico City has recently passed a series of laws which are considered liberal in Latin America , such as legalising abortion in the first months of pregnancy and allowing gay marriages .

 Americans are concerned about Iran 's nuclear program but split on whether military action should be undertaken if diplomacy and economic sanctions fail to stop it , according to a new USA TODAY / Gallup Poll .
The findings underscore public concern about an Iranian threat and a partisan divide over how to respond .
Iran has emerged as a key issue in the presidential race , especially among Democrats .
POLL RESULTSIran 's nuclear program
While 46 % of those surveyed say military action should be taken either now or if diplomacy fails , 45 % rule it out in any case .
Republicans are twice as likely as Democrats to endorse taking military steps .
" If you had more follow - on questions — on what if the military action was unilateral , ( for instance ) — then support would tend to diminish , " says Steven Kull , director of the Program on International Policy Attitudes at the University of Maryland .
" But it does indicate that approximately half of Americans are concerned enough that they would at least seriously consider it , and that 's worth noting . "
Tough talk from President Bush and Vice President Cheney about Iran 's nuclear program seems to have generated concern about a potential threat and alarm about the prospect for premature U.S. military action .
In the telephone survey of 1,024 adults Friday through Sunday : • Three of four Americans say they are concerned that the United States " will not do enough to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons . "
On this issue , there is bipartisan accord : 35 % of Republicans and 36 % of Democrats say they are " very concerned " about that prospect .
• However , three of four Americans also express concern that the United States " will be too quick to use military force " against Iran .
On that , partisans disagree .
Just 25 % of Republicans are " very concerned " about the premature use of military force , compared with 57 % of Democrats .
Presidential candidates Barack Obama and John Edwards have tapped Democrats ' unease on the issue in recent days , criticizing Hillary Rodham Clinton for backing a Senate resolution that designated the Iranian Revolutionary Guard a terrorist organization .
In a speech Monday in Iowa City , Edwards warned that the Bush administration " is repeating the march to war with Iran " as it did in the lead - up to the war with Iraq .
Meanwhile , Bush reached an unwelcome record .
By 64%-31 % , Americans disapprove of the job he is doing .
For the first time in the history of the Gallup Poll , 50 % say they " strongly disapprove " of the president .
Richard Nixon had reached the previous high , 48 % , just before an impeachment inquiry was launched in 1974 .

Many Harvard officials , Dr. Faust said , feared that cost was driving the choices students made about graduate school and careers and that it had created what amounted to a two - class system among Harvard undergraduates .
Mr. Fitzsimmons referred to it as “ the upstairs downstairs syndrome . ”
The officials said , for example , that often only the wealthy students can afford to pursue highly valuable but unpaid research opportunities with professors , take unpaid summer internships , study abroad or even spend time with their friends .
Under the new financial aid rules , the university said , a family making $ 120,000 would have to pay about $ 12,000 for a child to attend Harvard College , compared with more than $ 19,000 under current policies .
A family making $ 180,000 would pay $ 18,000 , down from $ 30,000 .
The university also plans to substitute grants for loans in all financial - aid packages and will no longer consider home equity in calculating aid .
The change in home equity considerations alone will mean , on average , a reduction of $ 4,000 a year in cost for those families whose home equity would previously have been a part of the financial aid calculation .
Harvard officials say they do not want families borrowing against their homes  or selling their homes  in order to send their children to the university .
“ If you had an oil well in the backyard , you could sell the oil , ” Mr. Fitzsimmons said .
“ But you need to live somewhere . ”
Currently , 763 students whose family incomes are between $ 120,000 and $ 180,000 receive some financial aid from Harvard , which has a total of 6,600 undergraduates .
The new policy will apply to them next year , officials said .
Only a handful of universities have anything even remotely close to Harvard ’s financial resources , and it was not clear how many could afford to follow .
Yale tersely said in response only that it was planning an announcement next month on expanded financial aid .
RIVERSIDE , Calif . -
Two engineers at the University of California , Riverside are part of a binational team that has found semiconducting nanotubes produced by living bacteria - a discovery that could help in the creation of a new generation of nanoelectronic devices .
The research team believes this is the first time nanotubes have been shown to be produced by biological rather than chemical means .
It opens the door to the possibility of cheaper and more environmentally friendly manufacture of electronic materials .
Study results appear in today 's issue of the early edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The team , including Nosang V. Myung , associate professor of chemical and environmental engineering in the Bourns College of Engineering , and his postdoctoral researcher Bongyoung Yoo , found the bacterium Shewanella facilitates the formation of arsenic - sulfide nanotubes that have unique physical and chemical properties not produced by chemical agents .
" We have shown that a jar with a bug in it can create potentially useful nanostructures , " Myung said .
" Nanotubes are of particular interest in materials science because the useful properties of a substance can be finely tuned according to the diameter and the thickness of the tubes . "
The whole realm of electronic devices which power our world , from computers to solar cells , today depend on chemical manufacturing processes which use tremendous energy , and leave behind toxic metals and chemicals .
Myung said a growing movement in science and engineering is looking for ways to produce semiconductors in more ecologically friendly ways .
Two members of the research team , Hor Gil Hur and Ji-Hoon Lee from Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology ( GIST ) , Korea , first discovered something unexpected happening when they attempted to remediate arsenic contamination using the metal - reducing bacterium Shewanella .
Myung , who specializes in electro - chemical material synthesis and device fabrication , was able to characterize the resulting nano - material .
The photoactive arsenic - sulfide nanotubes produced by the bacteria behave as metals with electrical and photoconductive properties .
The researchers report that these properties may also provide novel functionality for the next generation of semiconductors in nano - and opto-electronic devices .
In a process that is not yet fully understood , the Shewanella bacterium secretes polysacarides that seem to produce the template for the arsenic sulfide nanotubes , Myung explained .
The practical significance of this technique would be much greater if a bacterial species were identified that could produce nanotubes of cadmium sulfide or other superior semiconductor materials , he added .
" This is just a first step that points the way to future investigation , " he said .
" Each species of Shewanella might have individual implications for manufacturing properties . "

Myung , Yoo , Hur and Lee were joined in the research by Min-Gyu Kim , Pohang Accelerator Laboratory , Pohang , Korea ; Jongsun Maeng and Takhee Lee , GIST ; Alice C. Dohnalkova and James K. Fredrickson , Pacific Northwest National Laboratory , Richland , Wash . ; and Michael J. Sadowsky , University of Minnesota .
The Center for Nanoscale Innovation for Defense provided funding for Myung 's contribution to the study .
The University of California , Riverside is a doctoral research university , a living laboratory for groundbreaking exploration of issues critical to Inland Southern California , the state and communities around the world .
Reflecting California 's diverse culture , UCR 's enrollment of about 17,000 is projected to grow to 21,000 students by 2010 .
The campus is planning a medical school and already has reached the heart of the Coachella Valley by way of the UCR Palm Desert Graduate Center .

SAN FRANCISCO –
For the first time , scientists have proof in human subjects that a derivative of an ingredient in red wine combats some symptoms of aging .
Sirtris Pharmaceuticals announced the results here on Monday at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference .
Resveratol , naturally found in red wine , stimulates a gene known as SIRT1 , which has been linked with extended lifespans in rodents .
The new study is the first time similar effects have been replicated in humans .
" We believe that this is the first time that a drug candidate has shown efficacy in a disease of aging by targeting the genes that control aging , " said Christoph Westphal , CEO of Sirtris .
Sirtris was co-founded by David Sinclair , a Harvard Medical School researcher , who discovered SIRT1's role in regulating lifespan .
His early work was in yeast , and he later showed that stimulating SIRT1 through a calorie - restricted diet helped animals live longer .
Then , Sinclair found resveratol , which stimulates the same gene with results similar to calorie - restriction but without the diet .
Resveratrol 's effects in mice touched off a storm of excitement among people , including Sinclair , who began taking the drug in its over - the - counter form hoping to extend their lifespans .
Sirtris ' proprietary formulation of the drug significantly reduced blood sugar in 67 diabetic patients as compared with a placebo group .
The results are an important milestone in bringing resveratrol - related drugs to market .
The study , however , ran just 28 days and had conservative goals : to measure whether a resveratol formulation called SRT501 , which is five times easier for the body to use than naturally occurring resveratol , was safe and had some activity in humans .
Getting the drug through the regulatory process will take until at least 2012 , the company said .
The results partially answer skeptics like Steven Austad , a cellular biologist and longevity researcher at the University of Texas , who expressed doubts about the impact of resveratol in humans to Wired News last year after mouse studies showed longevity gains .
" People in the research community tend to think of mice as small little furry humans with long tails , but they 're not , " Austad said at the time .
" We do n't know what it will do . "
Sirtris can now say it does know what SRT501 does , at least for a small number of patients over a short period of time :
It works .
Patients in the trial were given 2,500 or 5,000 milligrams of the drug in liquid form .
Both groups had positive outcomes with no side effects .
Westphal said during a question - and - answer session following his presentation at the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference that the unusually high doses were necessary because resveratrol is not a very potent molecule .
That 's why the company is also working with other molecules – potential drugs – that are unrelated to resveratrol but also stimulate the SIRT1 gene .
Some of the molecules could be up to 1,000 times more potent than resveratrol , he added .
Still , SRT501 was effective enough that Sirtris is continuing to push the drug through clinical trials .
" Based on the positive results , and the fact that there are a lot of desirable characteristics to SRT501 , we 've initiated a Phase IIa study combining SRT501 with the most common diabetic drug , metformin , " said Westphal .
" Those data are back in the second half of this year . "
Sirtris had an initial public offering of its stock back in May of 2007 and is up 23 percent since that time .
Following the clinical trial announcement , the stock gained 1.5 percent in after - hours trading .
If there 's one thing scientists have a knack for ( other than avoiding sexual contact with other human beings ) , it 's turning seemingly innocent things into horrifying specters of terror .
Atoms were just innocent old building blocks of matter up until they were used to level two Japanese cities .
Apparently bored with the military weapons as an outlet for their evil , scientists are upping their pant - soiling quotient by genetically engineering monsters out of our livestock and pets .

5 Super -Speed Mice
Good lord , what is it ?
Biologists at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland have taken ordinary field mice and , rather than bopping them over the head , opted to genetically modify them by limiting the biochemical process which allows for explosive bursts of energy .
The end result of this limitation is that endurance energy becomes massively increased , thus enabling them to " run up to four miles at a speed of 20 meters a minute for five hours or more without stopping . "

The mice also live longer , eat more , mate more often ( and for three times as long ) and when provoked , inform you in thick Russian accents that they " must break you . "
They do take longer to recover than their unmodified brethren , and suffer greater muscle damage from the exertion in what one researcher called a " double - edged sword . "
Fellow researchers , upon hearing this , declared it to be an awesome idea and immediately set about engineering Double - Edged - Sword - Mice .
For the love of god , why are they doing this ?
Well , Cleveland is boring .
Also , the enzyme responsible for this behavior , PEPCK - C ( apparently , the only enzyme sponsored by PepsiCo ) could potentially be used to fight a bevy of debilitating afflictions such as McArdle 's Disease , Cystic Fibrosis and Chronic Weak - Kneed Pansy Syndrome .
Lead project researcher Prof .
Hanson grudgingly admits that it is " very possible " their results could also be used to produce muscle enhancing drugs that could easily be abused for their potential to greatly enhance any and all athletic abilities .
After the interview , Prof .
Hanson returned to his work , watching mice run on itty - bitty treadmills , swim about in tiny mouse - pools , and wear miniscule Christmas sweaters , though he readily admits that last one is " just because . "

We strongly suspect that the motivations for the experiments will be made much clearer when they try to splice a Mexican accent into the super mouse and outfit him with a tiny sombrero , finally bringing to fruition a seemingly impossible dream :
What 's going to happen to us ?
Though super - fast , super - enduring mice might seem to be a plague of cuddles and wuddles rather than death and destruction , we would remind you of their disease carrying tendencies .
Field mice are the Tommy Lee of nature , spreading disease like tiny little Motley Crue reunion tours .
Mice literally decimated Europe in the Middle Ages by carrying the bubonic plague .
Now , imagine if those same mice were physically incapable of tiring , could cover five times the ground , and breed all the way up until they die - at three times the age of a normal mouse .

Even more terrifying a prospect , however , is the " very possible " potential for this modified enzyme to be used as a drug in humans .
The drug would enhance every single aspect of physical performance , while increasing both life span and libido .
This sounds initially like a wonder ; it 's all the promises of your spam mail subject lines coming to life and all you have to do is freebase a super - mouse !
That is , until you listen to Prof.
Hanson , himself , who admits that " On the downside , they eat twice as much as control mice , but they are half the weight and are very aggressive .
Why this is the case , we are not really sure . "
There 's a series of posts I 've done for Daily Kos about how the Feds are preparing for an influenza pandemic , including disaster preparedness , and pandemic preparedness , as well as a review of the National Response Framework that the federal government uses to approach disasters and disaster management .
A recent position paper by the ACLU has brought this back into the headlines .
How far the Feds can and will go to contain a pandemic and protect your health is an important topic both to discuss and to track .
The ACLU report provides an opportunity to review selected aspects of this topic .
Background
Flu pandemics are different than other disasters because they are extensive ( they happen everywhere ) , significant ( a quarter of the population might be affected , with a third of the population unable to report for work because of illness or health care obligations for dependents and others ) and require careful planning to help prevent spread of disease as well as to mitigate the disruption a pandemic would bring to our worldwide just - in - time economic system .
One aspect of this planning includes the use , and consideration of , isolation and quarantine at the beginning of a pandemic outbreak , when containment is still theoretically feasible ( although many experts doubt if containment is indeed ever feasible ) .
From Flu Wiki :
Isolation and quarantine are two public health strategies designed to protect the public by preventing exposure to infected or potentially infected persons .
In general , isolation refers to the separation of persons who have a specific infectious illness from those who are healthy and the restriction of their movement to stop the spread of that illness .
Isolation is a standard procedure used in hospitals today for patients with tuberculosis and certain other infectious diseases .
Quarantine , in contrast , is very unusual and generally refers to the separation and restriction of movement of persons who , while not yet ill , have been exposed to an infectious agent and therefore may become infectious .
Quarantine of exposed persons is a public health strategy that is intended to stop the spread of infectious disease .
Both isolation and quarantine may be conducted on a voluntary basis , and this is usual , or compelled on a mandatory basis through legal authority .
Back in 2005 , George Bush held a news conference in which he proposed military intervention .
The United States may need to quarantine regions of the country if localized outbreaks of a pandemic flu occur , US President George Bush said today during a press conference in Washington , DC .
Bush suggested expanding presidential power over state - run National Guard operations to implement such quarantines in the event of a pandemic .
By executive order ( April 1 , 2005 ) pandemic influenza was added to the Public Health Service Act of 2003 as a quarantine disease .
However , there was considerable push - back from the public health community at that time ( link is to a Boston Globe op - ed from George Annas :
WHENEVER THE world is not to his liking , President Bush has a tendency to turn to the military to make it better .
The most prominent example is the country 's response to 9/11 , complete with wars in Afghanistan and Iraq .
After Hurricane Katrina , Bush belatedly called on the military to assist in securing New Orleans , and has since suggested that Congress should consider empowering the military to be the ' ' first responders " in any national disaster .
On Tuesday , the president suggested that the United States should confront the risk of a bird flu pandemic by giving him the power to use the US military to quarantine '' part[s ] of the country " experiencing an ' ' outbreak . "
So we have moved quickly in the past month , at least metaphorically , from the global war on terror to a proposed war on hurricanes , to a proposed war on the bird flu .
Of all these proposals , the use of the military to attempt to contain a flu pandemic on US soil is the most dangerous ...
Planning makes sense .
But planning for ' ' brutal " or '' extreme " quarantine of large numbers or areas of the United States would create many more problems than it could solve ...
Public health in the 21st century should be federally directed , but effective public health policy must be based on trust , not fear of the public .
Since then , and until recently , the voluntary nature of quarantine and containment has been stressed by CDC , HHS and federal disaster planners .
Contemporary Concerns
On Monday of this week , the ACLU issued a strongly - worded report entitled Pandemic Preparedness : The Need for a Public Health — Not a Law Enforcement / National Security — Approach , co-authored by George Annas , the same author of the Boston Globe editorial from 2005 ( more after the flip ) .
The latest sign that growth in consumer spending , the mainstay of the U.S. economy , is slowing ?
A nip and tuck in spending on cosmetic surgery .
The slowdown was a hot topic at the meeting of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons in Baltimore this fall .
One breast - implant maker sees hints of a slowdown in demand .
The number of vision - correction surgeries appears to be falling as well .
" This whole mortgage credit crisis is making people think twice , " said J. Peter Rubin , a Pittsburgh plastic surgeon .
" It 's something I 've noticed and some colleagues have noticed as well . "
While anecdotal , the industry chatter is the latest worrying hint of a broader slowdown in consumer spending , which accounts for 70 % of the U.S. economy -- and fodder for a broader debate on how deep such a slowdown might bite .
The big question is whether the triple whammy of falling home prices , still - high energy prices and a credit crunch will crimp consumer spending so much that the nation slides into recession .
Consumers spend more on housing , health care , education , travel , restaurants and other services -- $ 4.6 trillion last year -- than they do on food , gasoline , clothing , electronics , cars and other goods -- $ 3.6 trillion .
Spending on services such as education and housing tends to be less sensitive to economic swings .
But discretionary spending , such as elective medical procedures or airline tickets , is susceptible to cyclical pressures .
Consumers sound pessimistic .
On Friday , the Reuters / University of Michigan 's index of consumer sentiment reported a decline in early December to a level lower than any month since 1992 -- except for the month following Hurricane Katrina .
Gloom among lower - income households more than offset gains in better - off households .
The Conference Board 's survey is similarly weak .
Besides rising mortgages delinquencies and home foreclosures , delinquencies in the auto - loan market are ticking up to the highest level in several years , and lenders are tightening terms .
Student loans are weakening too .
After Moody's Corp. cited rising default rates in student loans as reason to consider downgrading notes created by First Marblehead Corp. , the student - loan packager on Friday halved its dividend and said it would n't do another offering of bonds backed by student loans this quarter .
( See related article1 . )
Also Friday , Federal Reserve data suggested credit - card spending has slowed .
Consumer credit increased at an annual rate of 2.3 % in October , faster than September 's 1.6 % .
But that was less than half the pace of earlier in the year , and the acceleration in the growth of credit - card debt offset a second month of declines in the category that includes auto loans .
Credit - card issuers have been pulling back , with approval rates across the industry dropping to 33 % from 41 % a year ago , said Robert Hammer , chief executive of R.K.
Hammer , a bank - card advisory firm .
Many are raising fees and interest rates .
Brad Tober of Buffalo , N.Y. , recently got a notice that Capital One Financial Corp. was replacing the 9.9 % fixed rate on his credit card with a variable rate of about 19 % .
The 21 - year - old college student said he had n't paid a bill late or done anything that he anticipated would lead to a higher rate .
A spokeswoman for Capital One attributed the change to " business and economic " factors .
The broadest measure of consumer spending , one which includes food , energy and all other goods services , grew at a 2.7 % annual pace in the robust third - quarter .
Still , forecasters expect a substantial slowing in the current quarter , an important one to retailers depending on holiday sales .
Economists at Macroeconomic Advisers , a St. Louis forecasting firm , expect consumer spending to grow a mere 1.1 % seasonally adjusted pace in the current quarter .
To be sure , some economists expect the economy to keep rolling , despite what consumer - confidence surveys show .
" The surveys are useful for telling you the mood of consumers ... but they 're not that useful for forecasting how much consumers are going to spend , " said Dean Croushore , a University of Richmond economist whose research suggests declines in confidence do n't regularly foreshadow downturns in spending .
" Pay attention to what people do , not what people say .
As long as people 's incomes are doing fine and they have money to spend , they 'll spend it . "
The labor market has held up , a good sign since most Americans ' incomes come from their jobs .
The government said yesterday that employers added 94,000 jobs in November , roughly the average for the past six months .
The unemployment rate held steady at 4.7 % .
But even here there are some signs of weakening .
Initial claims for unemployment benefits are running at a four - week moving average of 340,000 , the highest since October 2005 .
Fed policymakers ' latest forecast shows the jobless rate rising to between 4.8 % and 4.9 % next year , and the outlook has darkened since those projections were made in late October .
The Christmas season will fill in some blanks .
Consumer purchases of big - ticket items , such as cars and furniture , are far more volatile than purchases of services .
When times get tough , spending that can deferred often is .
That 's where plastic surgery comes in .
Last year , Americans spent an estimated $ 11.4 billion on plastic surgeon fees and probably close to $ 4 billion more when facility fees and anesthesia are included , according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons .
Breast jobs and tummy tucks are n't covered by insurance , so patients need a chunk of cash -- or a healthy credit line .
So far , the slowdown in some plastic surgeons ' offices appears to be affecting big - ticket surgeries rather than less costly procedures such as anti-wrinkle facial injections .
Some surgeons say business did n't pick up this fall as much as usual .
Others say they have been busy but have lighter bookings for next year .
Patients typically go under the knife in January and February to allow time to recuperate before bathing - suit weather arrives .
Breast - implant maker Mentor Corp. in Santa Barbara , Calif. , says the surgeons who are its customers have noticed a drop in patient interest .
Since last November when the Food and Drug Administration returned silicone implants to the cosmetic market after a 14 - year partial ban , Mentor 's sales have been strong .
But the company detected some disturbing signs at the end of the quarter ended Sept. 30 .
In a conference call with analysts , Mentor Chief Executive Joshua Levine , sounded a cautionary note .
Some plastic surgeons , he said , are seeing a drop - off in patient consultations , which is " usually a little bit of a precursor to lighter surgical calendars maybe 45 to 60 days out . "
He said he was n't sure if a significant slowdown was on the way , but warned , " If we 're going to have a real problem in the broader economy , we wo n't escape that . "
Investors treated his remarks as an inflection point .
The impact was heightened because it followed laser maker Cutera Inc. 's announcement that it would discontinue giving financial guidance to investors .
Cutera , of Brisbane , Calif. , said that " a number of factors , including recent signs of a slowing market growth rate , have made it more difficult to accurately predict our future financial performance . "
Cutera lasers as used for hair removal and skin rejuvenation among other aesthetic therapies .
Companies that lend money to consumers for such procedures say the business has been growing so quickly that it 's nearly impossible to detect cyclical swings .
" We have n't noticed a change in cosmetic surgery , " said Mike Testa , president of General Electric Co. 's Care Credit unit , which specializes in consumer loans for dental and medical procedures .
But people generally commit to cosmetic surgery and take out a loan months later , so it may be too early to see a trend , he said .
Care Credit has , however , noticed a downturn in another popular procedure -- laser vision - correction surgery .
Volume dropped 10 % in October , the sharpest decline the firm has ever seen in such procedures , Mr. Testa said .
Over the past five years or so , the volume of such surgeries has closely tracked the Conference Board 's consumer confidence index , said Dave Harmon , president of Market Scope LLC , a market - research firm in Manchester , Mo. Last month , Mr. Harmon cut his 2007 estimate of vision - correction surgeries by 2.6 % to 1.38 million .
In recent years , he says , 80 % of the change of volume in such surgeries can be explained by changes in consumer confidence .

Brand spanking new
What 's the meaning of the phrase ' Brand spanking new ' ?
Entirely new .
What 's the origin of the phrase ' Brand spanking new ' ?
For those of us of a certain age the word ' brand ' turns our thoughts to Hollywood B - feature movies and images of cowboys branding cattle on the open range .
That 's not the origin of this phrase , but it 's not a million miles away in terms of meaning .
A hot burned wooden stake has been called a ' brand ' since at least 950 AD .
' To brand ' means to ' make an indelible mark of ownership ' , especially with a hot stake or iron .
This verb usage has been known since the Middle Ages and is clearly derived from the earlier name ( we might say brand name - but we 'll come to that later ) .
The earliest citation of ' brand new ' is in John Foxe 's Sermons , 1570 :
" New bodies , new minds and all thinges new , brande - newe . "
Terms that are old often come to us with a variety of spellings .
In this case there are many variants , notable ' bran new ' , for example :
John Gay's , The What d'ye call it ? - a farce , 1714 : " Wear these Breeches Tom ; they 're quite bran - new . "
The Times from 1788 : " The liquor fpoiled a bran new pair of fattin breaches . "
[ Note that The Times persisted in printing the long form of ' s ' characters ( which resemble the letter ' f ' with a short cross - bar ) as late as 1788 .
This form had been commonplace in printed material until about 1780 , when it went into a sudden decline . ]
Other spellings include ' brent ' and ' brank ' :
Burns , Tam o' Shanter , 1790 : " Nae cotillon brent new frae France . "
Scott , St. Ronan's , 1824 : " Yeomen with the brank new blues and buckskins . "
These spellings are n't , of course , different words but simply alternative pronunciations of ' brand ' .
Not just ' new ' , not just ' brand new ' , but ' brand spanking new ' ,
It is sometimes put about that ' brand new ' comes from marketing jargon , where terms like ' brand loyalty ' etc. are commonplace .
That 's about a thousand years too late as the origin , but again , it does have the same meaning as the early form .
A ' brand ' in marketing terms comes from the meaning of the word as ' a particular class of goods , as indicated by a trade mark ' .
So , that 's ' brand new ' ; what about the double form ' brand spanking new ' ?
Spanking is little more than an intensifier in this phrase .
The word does have a distinct meaning , unrelated to ' slapping with the hand ' , which is ' exceptionally large or fine ' ; for example , Fanshawe 's Love for Love 's sake , 1666 :
" What a spanking Labradora ! "
As with the spellings there are variants of the intensified form - ' brand span new ' , ' spick and span new ' , etc .
These citations pre-date any known version of ' brand spanking new ' :
Henry Angelo's Reminiscences , 1830 : " His feet were thrust into a bran - span new pair of fashionable pumps . "
The Whitby Glossary , 1855 : " Brandnew , Brandspandernew , fresh from the maker 's hands , or ' spic and span new ' . "
It appears that whoever coined ' brand spanking new ' did so by appropriating the imagery of ' spick and span ' , the rhyming of ' bran ' and ' span ' and the meaning of ' spanking ' to produce a satisfying - sounding phrase with some appropriate associations .
Whatever the intent of the early users of the phrase it is , in Eric Partridge 's meaning of the term , a catchphrase , that is , it has caught on .
It appears to have been coined around the turn of the 20th century and is still in common use .
The earliest printed citation I can find is in a story about a luckless sea captain , in Harper 's New Monthly Magazine , April 1860 , titled Captain Tom : A Resurrection :
SHE arrived in Los Angeles with $ 600 in borrowed cash , a failing heart and arthritis in both knees .
She spoke no English .
She had not seen her firstborn son , Tuan , in the 20 years since he fled Vietnam for the United States as a teenager .
Judging from the letters he sent home , he had prospered here .
He was repairing watches , living in Santa Ana .
Inexplicably , four years ago , his letters had stopped coming .
Now , Hai Nguyen had crossed the ocean herself , hoping to find her son before she died .
She had one lead , the address in Santa Ana .
She took a cab there from the airport .
She went to the door to find that her son was long gone , leaving no clue behind .
She shuffled away with her single suitcase , not knowing what to do next .
He could be anywhere .
She had no grasp of America ’s immensity , though a friend who knew the country tried to warn her :
It would be like finding a needle at the bottom of the sea .
Where would she start looking , in a country of 300 million strangers ?
Still , how could she go to her grave without trying ?

So in September , a tiny 57 - year - old woman began stubbornly pushing a pair of green , worn - out plastic flip - flops along the sidewalks and strip malls and alleys of Southern California , past street signs she could n’t read and storefronts she could n’t fathom .
She did n’t have long -- just a few months before her visa expired in January , maybe less before her legs buckled or her heart quit or her cancer returned .
Or her money ran out .
She had a husky voice and thick , rough hands .
Her skin was the deep brown of the Vietnamese poor who spend their lives in the sun .
She printed fliers with Tuan ’s face and stuffed them in the hands of street people and business owners and anyone who might listen .
She found her way to Little Saigon in Westminster , the country ’s largest Vietnamese American enclave .
There , people sympathized .
They gave her couches to sleep on , bowls of soup .
In their own flight from starvation and violence , many had said goodbye to their families in Vietnam , often forever .
Parents cleft from children was one of the community ’s defining stories .
So was arrival in the States with little save hope .
But in other ways she was hardly familiar , this worn - looking woman who had single - mindedly chased hope 8,000 miles , knowing so little , and having no time to count the odds .

HE was 16 when she sent him to the boat .
For his passage out of Vietnam , the price was two bars of gold that she spent a year buying on layaway .
It was 1986 , and Ho Chi Minh City was a desperate place .
Everyone she knew was starving .
She knew Tuan ’s escape would be risky .
Once before , the scrawny , gap - toothed boy had tried to flee the country only to be seized by police and thrown into jail for six months , to return home even more haggard and emaciated than before .
Now , around midnight at a big marketplace , she handed him to the boat captain who would smuggle him away .
She had packed her son a bag with three changes of clothes , sweet rice , moon cakes and lemon bars .
She could tell him nothing about America -- not what it looked like , not its language or customs , not its size or landmarks .
She knew it only as a mythical country over the sea where people had opportunity and plump cheeks .
America was , in one popular phrase , the Jungle of Money .
Advertisement
But it was inconceivably far , and many died on the way .
She tried to hold her tears , not wanting to scare Tuan or make him hesitate .
Existence had been a day - to - day struggle since 1973 , when her husband , a Vietnamese army soldier , died fighting the Communists .
Orphaned of his father as a toddler , Tuan would now face life without his mother , a misfortune that a Vietnamese proverb found even more profound .
Lose your father , you can still eat a poor meal of rice with fish , the proverb went .
Lose a mother , you lick the leaves littering the streets .
It conjured the crumbs clinging to castoff leaves used to pack food .
But as she saw it , there was no choice .
On the night they said goodbye , it was raining lightly .
She kissed him and told him , I love you .
Write .
She watched him go .
He seemed eager .
Advertisement
She did not know if she would see him again .
She had two other children to take care of , a son and a daughter .
To feed them , she peddled grain from her bicycle and fruit at the market .
There was no money to send them away too , or she would have .
*
SOON Tuan ’s letters started arriving .
He wrote of many days at sea , of running out of food and water and then being rescued by a commercial fishing boat that took them to Malaysia .
Of how he found his way to the United States , to Minnesota , which was so cold he moved on to Denver , then farther west , to Southern California .
His letters came steadily for years .
He wrote that he was doing well , learning to repair watches .
He said nothing to worry her .
He sent a picture of himself , smiling .
His muscles were thick .
His cheeks were full .
America had been good .

In Vietnam , where a mother ’s worth is largely defined by the accomplishments of her kids , to say “ I have a son in America ” conferred instant pride and status .
Everyone understood that fate had smiled on the family .
In 2001 , doctors diagnosed Nguyen with ovarian cancer and gave her two months to live , a prediction she was able to defy with chemotherapy and surgery .
Tuan sent $ 500 and spoke of visiting .
Then his letters stopped coming .
Twice , medical bills forced her to move to smaller quarters , so she thought perhaps his letters were getting lost .
A year passed without word from him , and another , then a third and a fourth .
Her cancer seemed to be in remission , but her overall health was poor .
She had developed a heart condition , osteoporosis , arthritis .
She knew she was dying , and her final wish was to see him .
She gathered her savings , which had been meant to buy her burial plot .
Her younger son , who worked as an ambulance driver , and her daughter , who sold clothes out of a small shop , scraped together loans .
Finally she had $ 1,400 , enough for a ticket to California .
It was her first time on a plane outside the country .
Crossing the ocean , she could n’t eat or sleep .

*
SHE was not in America long before her money ran out .
She had covered mile after mile on foot , stuffed fliers into hundreds of hands , and still there was no sign of him .
At wit ’s end , she pleaded with Nguoi Viet , the country ’s largest Vietnamese - language paper , based in Little Saigon .
It published her story and a 5 - year - old picture of Tuan , the one of him smiling with full cheeks .
Soon , local radio picked it up .
Donations started pouring in , as well as tips .
One led her to the Westminster Police Department , where she learned two things that shocked her , upending her image of the solid , prosperous life Tuan had lived in the States .
At some point , she learned , her son had been incarcerated for robbery .
At another point , he had stayed at the Los Angeles Mission .
That meant he had been homeless , the orphaned beggar from the proverb .
The possibility of a plummet so extreme had not occurred to her .
The Vietnamese had flourished in the United States , and the community had a reputation for taking care of its own .
What had happened to her son ?
Advertisement
She took a cab to the mission , but he was n’t there .
She printed and distributed more fliers , this time offering a $ 1,000 reward .
It was money she did n’t have , but she was desperate .
She got word that a man who looked like her son dug up recyclables in the trashcans at John Wayne Airport .
For a week , she went there every day , waiting .
No luck .
She had reconciled herself to the possibility that she would find him dead .
But even that , she reasoned , would be some consolation , better than not knowing .
Chasing every lead , she took cabs to the Asian Garden Mall and Chinatown and across the San Gabriel Valley .
She searched homeless shelters and alleys , parks and strip malls .
All through the land of promise , to her astonishment , the concrete was littered with human shapes crouched under reeking blankets .
Advertisement
She went from shape to shape , slowly lifting the blankets off ragged , hollow - eyed faces that smelled of beer , off men with tangled hair and dirty hands .
They cursed in words she could n’t understand and yanked their blankets back , many of them , sinking back into their covers .
Some just looked at her in bewilderment .
She looked into dozens of hopeless faces .
There were other mothers ’ sons , but not hers .
Sorry , she said , over and over .
Sorry .
Sorry .
Sorry .
It was one of the few English words she had learned .
She shuffled forward long after her knees burned with pain and her breath came short .
When it got too bad , she would sit down on a bus bench and rest .
She thought of giving up , taking a plane home to die without him .
Then she would get up and keep walking .
Finally , in November , there came an improbable call from a restaurateur in San Jose , a woman named Huong Le who had seen Nguyen ’s story on Vietnamese - language television .
She said Tuan had been living behind her restaurant for the last couple of months at the Lion Plaza shopping center on King Boulevard .
He slept on the sidewalk on a patch of cardboard .

On Nov. 19 , a woman moved by her story offered her a ride from Orange County to San Jose .
It was about noon when she found the restaurant .
Her son was n’t there , but restaurant employees said they had been taking care of him .
When he was hungry , he ’d knock lightly on the rear kitchen door and they would pass him beef noodles and rice , bread and pork .
He rarely spoke , they said , and often stood completely immobile .
But they found him polite , unthreatening .
Look for his blanket , they told Nguyen .
It ’s blue and yellow fleece .
We gave it to him .
After three hours of searching , there in a parking lot across the street , she spotted the blanket .
It was just another filthy shape , curled upon a sheet of blue vinyl against some bushes , beside castoff rolls of iron fencing and rusted steel bars .
From the blanket protruded one shoe with a gashed sole .
On the ground were takeout containers filled with rotting Vietnamese food .
She had been searching in the United States for three months , lifting blankets off men and women who had somehow fallen into its sewers .
Now she knelt and lifted one more .

RIGHT away she knew it was him , even through his thick , tangled beard and his long , unkempt hair .
He was sleeping , curled in a fetal position , and she startled him awake .
She knelt , looking closer .
She recognized his overbite , his eyes that were so much like his father ’s , the scar on his left brow he got as a kid , jumping on a bed with his brother .
She was shaking .
Looking at him , she could n’t speak .
When words came , she told him through her tears who she was and that she had come across the world to find him .
You have the wrong person , he said .
You ’re not my mother .
My mother is sick in Vietnam and ready to die .
Advertisement
She begged him to let her hug him , but he refused .
His only possessions were his blanket , a windbreaker , a pocketknife , and 69 cents .
Why would you want to hug a homeless man ?
he said .
Would n’t you be ashamed ?
She planted herself on the pavement , refusing to budge .
Afraid he would run away , she grabbed his collar and held him .
He kept saying , Let go of me , woman .
But she had not flown 8,000 miles and walked for three months to go home without him .
She talked the restaurant into calling the police , hoping they would hold him .
Advertisement
They took him to the Santa Clara Valley Medical Center for observation in the psychiatric unit .
They shaved him and cleaned him and gave him a room .
She came every day , to sit with him .
He said little .
Mostly he sat slouched forward , staring at the floor , his hands folded in his lap .
He seemed to recognize her but would not acknowledge it .
Perhaps he just could not grasp the improbability of a poor woman from Vietnam coming to find him in a land so large .
When he did speak , he told of having been chased by men who meant to harm him .
She did not know what it meant , whether it was a real memory or part of what doctors called his mental illness .
They had diagnosed him with an unspecific psychotic disorder .
There were details of his time in the United States that she did n’t ask about .
So she would not learn that in 1995 , he and several other men had burst into an Arcadia home and used a rope to tie up a man and his wife before making off with their cash and jewelry .
That police had labeled him a gang member .
That a judge had sentenced him to 10 years in state prison , though he was released in five .
That he went to prison three more times on parole violations , finally going free in January .
Advertisement
I ’m nobody , he kept saying .
You do n’t want anything to do with me .
Hoping to break through , she brought him photos of his brother and sister back in Vietnam , of aunts and nieces and nephews .
She spoke of taking him home to Vietnam .
She did not dwell on whether such a trip was even possible .
She had to return in January , when her visa expired .
It was not clear whether authorities would let him go too .
For now , though , she had arranged a place for them to stay , at the Cao Dai Temple in San Jose , when the hospital released him .
She ran her hand up and down his back and promised she would n’t leave him .
She would take care of him from now on .
She told him that it did n’t matter to her , whatever had happened , whatever he ’d done .
She blamed herself for sending him across the world with no one to watch over him .
Advertisement
Five days had passed since she rescued him from the streets , and all he would call her is “ aunt , ” a generic Vietnamese term for an older woman , not necessarily of blood relation .
Now , he spoke a word she had not heard him utter in 20 years .
Mother .

Back in 2006 , George R.R. Martin , the creator A Song of Ice and Fire series which led to HBO 's Game of Thrones , visited Victoria , B.C. - home of AbeBooks - on a book tour .
HBO Productions had not yet purchased the broadcast rights for the Fire and Ice novels .
George was kind enough to speak to our former colleague Andrea Warner - the interview sheds light on his long career and his motivations when writing .
Let 's remember that George R. R. Martin was a star of science fiction and fantasy writing long before Game of Thrones came along - his first published story ran in the February 1971 issue of Galaxy Magazine .
AbeBooks :
Do you remember the first story you wrote when you were a kid ?
George : First story ...
I probably still have it in a drawer somewhere .
I 'm a real pack rat ; I save everything .
I have this drawer , a trunk - it depends on how you define a story .
I have this booklet ; it 's like a space encyclopedia that I wrote as a kid .
One of those tablets , with the marble covers , you know , where you take your pen and you fill in the white part until it 's black and blue ?
It 's all written in that .
An Encyclopedia of the Planets , with me doing the artwork , which mostly consisted of me drawing a circle , and then me writing a few things about the planet .
It 's a strange mixture of fact and fiction .
It 's got Mars on it , like Mars is the red planet and it has canals , and then it's got the planet Orm or something that I made , where I made up stuff about it .
And it 's got planets from Flash Gordon and Rocky Joe Space Ranger , which is a show I watched , mixed with planets that are entirely my own invention , as far as I know , mixed with real planets .
It 's sort of block printed .
It must have been first grade , because I had n't learned handwriting yet , which I think is second grade .
( Laughs )
AbeBooks : Wow .
That shows a lot of dedication at such a young age .
George :
Of course it 's not finished .
I did n't finish anything for decades .
Game of Thrones Boxed Set
AbeBooks :
So you had an interest in science fiction since you were quite young ?
George : Yeah , that 's sort of what I 've always really read .
I often think comic books were the things that made me a reader .
You learn to read in school with Dick and Jane , but the Dick and Jane stuff was so dull !
( Laughs ) Run , Dick , run .
See Spot run .
You know , the stories were stupid , even for a first or second grader .
Years later I saw some of the famous McGuffey readers , go back further , things that my mother 's generation would read from in the 1930s or 1920s , and those things were filled with real stories from real writers that the kids were learning .
But my generation , the baby boomers , we had Dick and Jane , and that could n't convince me to keep reading .
But Batman and Superman could : they were much more interesting than Dick and Jane .
And when I found comic books I loved them and continued to read those for years .
AbeBooks : I know you 've done some work in Hollywood over the years .
Have you ever thought of working or adapting something for a Batman franchise or something similar ?
George :
Well , you know I have my own Wild Card series , which is sort of my own version of Super Heroes , but you can't just adapt whatever you want for Hollywood .
You have to wait for a studio to hire you and I had interviews for some Super Hero type jobs , but I never actually got any .
They 've done some good adaptations in recent years .
The X - Men and the Spiderman franchises in particular have done good work .
My first publication in a professional magazine , I was n't paid for it , but it was Fantastic Four # 17 .
It was a letter .
( Laughs ) .
It said something like , " Stan Lee , better than Shakespeare . "
AbeBooks :
Which writers do you most admire ?
George :
It would be a long list .
Writers had the biggest impact on me when I was young ; you 're more impressionable .
You have less life experience , you 're more likely to be wowed .
I read science fiction , fantasy , horror , all interchangeably , I did n't make sharp genre distinctions as other people do these days .
Robert A. Heinlein certainly was my favorite writer .
I was given , by a friend of my mother , a hard cover copy of , Have Spacesuit - Will Travel , Scribner 's Juveniles .
It was the first actual science fiction book I read , and was for many years the only hard cover book I owned because we could n't afford hard covers .
But , it hooked me on science fiction , so instead of buying four comic books , I 'd buy one paperback book for 35 cents .
In junior high I read Tolkien 's Lord of the Rings , and that 's still a book I admire vastly .
I re-read it every few years , or at least dip into it .
H.P. Lovecraft had a great impact on me at a certain point .
Horror , his stories scared the hell out of me .
Robert E. Howard - you know , Conan the Barbarian is great for a 13 - year - old boy .
It 's a good age to discover Conan .
Certain writers you have to read at certain ages .
AbeBooks : I agree completely .
George : Like , I missed Edgar Rice Burroughs .
Years later in my Hollywood age , I got hired by Disney to adapt A Princess of Mars , so I picked up Edgar for the first time , and ( laughs ) he's ... not a good writer to sample at 45 .
AbeBooks :
When you were coming up with the series Ice and Fire , what sorts of inspirations did you draw on ?
George :
To a certain extent , it depends on when you 're talking about .
The first notion of the series came to me in ' 91 , when I was mostly working in Hollywood .
The first chapter came to me very vividly .
I did about 50 pages until Hollywood called again , and I had to put it in a drawer for what turned out to be a couple of years .
At that stage I did n't really know what I had .
A couple years later , I came back to it and found it still as fresh as when I 'd written it .
Finally I wrote about 150 pages and a brief summary of where I saw the story going .
At that point I visualized it as a fantasy trilogy , with only three books instead of the seven I now visualize .
AbeBooks :
There 's a certain attachment that you have to the characters as you 're reading the series , and then all of a sudden , they 're dead .
( George laughs )
It 's nail - biting !
Did any of your editors ever express concern that major characters were going to be killed off ?
George : No , everybody seems to like that .
Game of Thrones first edtions
AbeBooks :
It 's great to read , it just terrifies me .
George :
Well , that 's the idea - that you should care .
If the character 's in peril , you should be afraid to turn another page .
AbeBooks : I read that Tyrion is your favorite character .
George : Does n't mean he 's safe .
( Laughs )
He 's the easiest character to write .
I like his wit , and he's got a certain amount of torment and angst to him , which makes for good drama .
AbeBooks :
Not many of your characters are free from sin , in many ways , which is interesting .
George : I wanted to affect a certain human reality .
I do n't like fantasy where everybody is either a hero or a villain , black or white .
I prefer to paint with shades of grey .
I think it 's more true to life .
We 're all of us angels and demons in the same skin .
We do good things and the next day we maybe do terrible things .
AbeBooks :
Some critics have described your work as " high " fantasy .
What does that mean to you ?
George : Well , it 's Tolkien - esque fantasy .
I mean , you can slice the onion as many slices as you want , but some critics , for their convenience more than anything else , divided the broad area of fantasy into sub-genres , like " urban " fantasy or " dark " fantasy .
AbeBooks : I 've read very little fantasy in my life , but I immediately took to your books .
I think it 's partly the political intrigue as well .
George : I read fantasy , but I also read historical fiction and I wanted to give these books some of the flavor of good historical fiction .
In that sense it 's probably grittier and more realistic than most epic fantasy .
AbeBooks :
A lot of people really strive to find parallels between reality and these stories .
George : I 've certainly been inspired by things from real history .
I try to avoid one - to - one correspondence .
I mean , there are certain similarities .
You can look at Aegon the Conqueror and William the Conqueror .
There are certain similarities , but there are important differences .
William the Conqueror did n't have dragons or marry his two sisters .
( Laughs )
Those are rather important distinctions .
AbeBooks : Marrying the two sisters brings up an interesting point .
There are some that label your work as " dirty " because there is incest and graphic sexual scenes .
Are you faced with people saying , " I really like the work , but sometimes there 's just too much sex ? "
George : I get those letters sure .
Not a lot of them , but ...
AbeBooks :
Well , historically , it 's part of life .
George : Sure .
Well , you can't marry your sister anymore , but I 'm sure there are people who still sleep with them .
( Laughs )
There are a million books out there , which is my reaction when I get one of these letters .
You do n't happen to like a lot of sex in your fantasy , then there are 37 other authors you could read who do n't have sex in their fantasy .
Have fun .
It 's an important part of human life and necessary for any kind of realistic portrayal .
That 's my audience .
It 's a sad commentary on American morals that the sex is the thing that people object to .
I find that sad , but it is true .
I can describe an axe entering a person 's skull and no one objects , but if I describe a penis entering a vagina , there 's an outcry .
AbeBooks :
Some people say , " Oh , I avoid fantasy because the cover art is too dorky " or something .
I notice that this cover for A Feast for Crows is very different than any of the covers previously .
George :
They 've re-packaged the whole series and now the old books have been re-issued with matching , understated cover art .
There 's a lot of evidence that my books seem to be the fantasy series for people who do n't like fantasy .
And my publishers think there would be more of them if we could reach them , so they 've gone with this understated cover art , precisely to get those people who say , " Well , I do n't want to be seen carrying this thing with horses and knights and castles and dragons on the cover . "
It 's annoyed some of the original fans .
I get letters saying their sets do n't match anymore .
And , also from people who loved the old art .
AbeBooks :
It worked though .
I mean , number one on The New York Times bestseller list .
George :
It does seem to be working .
Even with something as successful as Harry Potter , re-issuing them with the more adult cover .
AbeBooks : I do n't know how they could possibly sell more copies of Harry Potter .
I thought everyone in the free world owned one .
George :
No , they 're trying to reach all the people who 've never read anyone except Dan Brown .

The owners of hipster music Web site Stereogum , which include former AOL executive Bob Pittman , former MTV digital guru Jason Hirschhorn and founder Scott Lapatine , have signed a deal to flip their equity stakes in the company to BuzzNet.com , The Post has learned .
According to a source close to the transaction , the deal values Stereogum at around $ 5 million .
This source stressed , however , that Stereogum was n’t being sold outright and that its owners were n’t cashing out of the Web site .
Rather , they have simply traded their equity stakes in Stereogum for an ownership percentage of BuzzNet , which is a fast - growing pop culture and music social - network .
Pittman , who now runs investment firm The Pilot Group , Hirschhorn and Lapatine own 100 percent of Stereogum .

122,295,345 votes were cast in the 2004 election for presidential candidates , yet Americans seem content to sit listening to the news and actually care what a few Iowa voters think .
I could n't count the number of times I 've heard , or read , that the Democrats now have a three way tie in Iowa , with Obama leading the pack with 28 % of the vote based on the latest poll .
That may mean something to someone , but I really could n't care less if 140 people in Iowa prefer Obama over Clinton or Edwards or Barney Fife , for that matter .
What 710 people sitting around cornfields in Iowa think about the candidates means virtually nothing to me , yet American voters seem to put so much stock in the Iowa caucuses .
Let 's take a real look at the latest poll on presidential candidates in Iowa .
The poll consisted of 500 likely Democratic caucus participants and 500 likely Republican caucus participants .
The poll was taken November 25 through November 29 and the participants were asked to identify their pick for president .
The top three results in both parties are as follows :
REPUBLICANS % of Votes Actual #
Of votes DEMOCRATS % of Votes Actual # Of Votes Huckabee 29 % 145 Obama 28 % 140 Romney 24 % 120 Clinton 25 % 125 Giuliani 13 % 65 Edwards 23 % 115 Total 66 % 330 76 % 380
While the top three in the Republican Party received 66 % of votes with only 4 % of participants undecided , the top three in the Democratic Party received 76 % of the votes with 7 % undecided .
The difference in votes between Obama 's 140 and Edwards 115 is only 25 while uncommitted votes represent a total of 35 votes .
What I find interesting about the latest poll is the number of actual participants polled .
The October 1 - 3 2007 poll consisted of 804 participants – 399 from the Democratic Party and 405 from the Republican Party , while the prior poll completed on May 12 - 16 , 2007 consisted of 801 participants – 400 from the Democratic Party and 401 from the Republican Party .
These polls may influence some voters in our country , but all they do is leave me with unanswered questions .
Why did the first two polls have a different number of participants from each party ?
Where did they come up with the additional 200 participants for the latest poll ?
What is the criterion for participating in an Iowa caucus poll ?
How would the poll results from the first two polls differ if the additional 200 participants had voted ?
David .
Q Mr. President , thank you .
I 'd like to follow on that .
When you talked about Iraq , you and others in the administration talked about a mushroom cloud ; then there were no WMD in Iraq .
When it came to Iran , you said in October , on October 17th , you warned about the prospect of World War III , when months before you made that statement , this intelligence about them suspending their weapons program back in '03 had already come to light to this administration .
So ca n't you be accused of hyping this threat ?
And do n't you worry that that undermines U.S. credibility ?
THE PRESIDENT : David , I do n't want to contradict an august reporter such as yourself , but I was made aware of the NIE last week .
In August , I think it was Mike McConnell came in and said , we have some new information .
He did n't tell me what the information was ; he did tell me it was going to take a while to analyze .
Why would you take time to analyze new information ?
One , you want to make sure it 's not disinformation .
You want to make sure the piece of intelligence you have is real .
And secondly , they want to make sure they understand the intelligence they gathered :
If they think it 's real , then what does it mean ?
And it was n't until last week that I was briefed on the NIE that is now public .
And the second part of your question has to do with this .
Look , Iran was dangerous , Iran is dangerous , and Iran will be dangerous if they have the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon .
The NIE says that Iran had a hidden -- a covert nuclear weapons program .
That 's what it said .
What 's to say they could n't start another covert nuclear weapons program ?
And the best way to ensure that the world is peaceful in the future is for the international community to continue to work together to say to the Iranians , we 're going to isolate you .
However , there is a better way forward for the Iranians .
Now , in 2003 , the Iranian government began to come to the table in discussions with the EU - 3 , facilitated by the United States .
In other words , we said to the EU - 3 , we 'll support your efforts to say to the Iranians , you have a choice to make :
You can continue to do policy that will isolate you , or there 's a better way forward , so that it was the sticks - and - carrots approach .
You might remember the United States said at that point in time , we 'll put the WTO on the table for consideration , or we 'll help you with spare parts for your airplanes .
It was all an attempt to take advantage of what we thought was a more open - minded Iranian regime at the time -- a willingness of this regime to talk about a way forward .
And then the Iranians had elections , and Ahmadinejad announced that -- to the IAEA that he was going to -- this is after , by the way , the Iranians had suspended their enrichment program -- he said , we 're going to stop the suspension , we 'll start up the program again .
And that 's where we are today .
My point is , is that there is a better way forward for the Iranians .
There has been a moment during my presidency in which diplomacy provided a way forward for the Iranians .
And our hope is we can get back on that path again .
But what is certain is that if Iran ever had the knowledge to develop a nuclear weapon and they passed that knowledge on to a covert program , which at one time in their history has existed , the world would be more dangerous .
And now is the time for the international community to work together .
Q Mr. President , thank you .
Just to follow , I understand what you 're saying about when you were informed about the NIE .
Are you saying at no point while the rhetoric was escalating , as " World War III " was making it into conversation , at no point nobody from your intelligence team or your administration was saying , maybe you want to back it down a little bit ?
The father and uncle of a young Kurdish woman began life sentences last night for arranging her " barbaric and callous " murder to restore their family 's " honour " .
Ari Mahmod , 51 , recruited a gang of thugs who tortured , raped and strangled his niece Banaz Mahmod , 20 , before cramming her body into a suitcase and burying it in a pit , where it lay for three months .
The brothers had decided Ms Mahmod was to be killed because she had fallen in love with a man they felt was unsuitable .
Ms Mahmod 's father , Mahmod Mahmod , 54 , left his home in Mitcham , south - west London , on the morning of the murder so that she could be killed there .
An older sister was in the house at the time .
An associate of Ari's , Mohamad Hama , 31 , who was recorded in prison boasting of kicking and stamping on Ms Mahmod 's neck " to get her soul out " , was also sentenced to life yesterday .
He pleaded guilty to murder .
The three men showed no emotion as they were ordered to serve a minimum of 60 years .
As they were sent down , relatives wept in the crowded public gallery .
Ari , a respected businessman whom the judge described as " the force behind the enterprise " , was told he would spend a minimum of 23 years behind bars , while Mahmod will serve 20 .
Hama will serve a minimum of 17 years .
Ms Mahmod 's sister Bekhal broke down in court as she described her as a good person , a " smart , fun and attractive lady with a caring personality " who wanted , above all , to be happy .
Speaking from behind a screen , in a black burka , she read an emotional statement on her love for her sister and her continuing fear for her own safety .
She said : " As I am separated from my family I have no one to share my memories of Banaz and no one to share my grief .
" If there 's one thing I could wish for it would be to have Banaz back .
I love her and I miss her . "
Ms Mahmod 's boyfriend , Rahmat Sulemani , 29 , told the court she was the " sweetest person in the world .
She only wanted to do good things for people . "
They had planned to marry and had already planned names for their children .
Mr Sulemani , whose grief has driven him to attempt suicide , said : " Banaz 's death has destroyed me completely inside and day after day I 'm falling apart . "
She was subjected to a series of sexually violent acts during a two - and a - half hour ordeal carried out by Hama and at least three men who have fled the country .
She had told police on four occasions that her family had threatened to kill her , and reported a murder attempt by her father .
There is now an IPCC investigation into the police handling of the case .
Brian Barker , the common serjeant of London , told the Mahmods : " You are both hard and unswerving men for whom apparent honour in the community is more important than the happiness of your flesh and blood and for whom killing in the name of honour is to be put above tolerance and understanding . "
He described Ms Mahmod as a young woman with personality and determination .
" Having endured a short and unhappy marriage , she made the mistake of falling in love with an accomplished man that you and you family thought was unsuitable .
So to restore your family honour you decided that she should die . "
He praised the courage of Bekhal and Mr Sulemani , for giving evidence at " considerable risk " to their own safety and commended Detective Inspector Caroline Goode for her " diligence and skill " in pursuing the case .
Edited extracts of Bekhal Mahmod 's statement to court :
" I find it really hard to say how much her death has affected me .
Words just do not say enough ... I left home when I was 16 , but I stayed in touch with [ my sister ] Banaz .
I knew what was happening to her , and how unhappy she was in her marriage .
When she split from her husband I knew of it .
The last time I saw Banaz alive was in 2005 ...
I have a picture , as I saw her on that occasion , wearing a grey tracksuit .
She did look rundown ... I have nothing of Banaz except two pictures , and I find it very hard to grieve for her .
As I am separated from my family , I have no one to share my memories or share my grief with .
I wish with all my heart I had taken her with me in 2005 because she would then still be alive .
Banaz was a smart , fun and attractive lady .
She had a very caring personality and got on with everyone .
As we grew up Banaz would tell me she wanted to be a professional person , a doctor or a lawyer .
Above all she wanted to be happy and have a loving husband and children ...
Since her disappearance I can honestly say there 's not been one night without having nightmares about what has happened to her .
Banaz herself does not come into my dreams or nightmares , and that upsets me ; I would like to see her again .
Because of the circumstances of Banaz 's death , I know I shall never be safe again , and constantly have to look over my shoulder .
I cry and become very upset when I think what 's happened to her .
My life will never be the same again .
If there 's one thing I could wish for it would be to have Banaz back .
I miss her and love her .
Banaz was very dear to me and a special sister and friend .
The world was not good enough for Banaz ; at least now she can rest like an angel . "
When you want to see something small , you use an optical microscope ; when you want to see something really small , you can use some form of electron microscope ; when you want to " see " individual atoms or molecules , you break out the scanning probe microscopes .
Scanning probe microscopes work by running a very sharp tip over a surface and forming the image of the surface from a signal read from the tip — akin to a record player reading the grooves on a record in order to play sound .
The first of these microscopy techniques , scanning tunneling microscopy ( STM ) , was developed by IBM researchers in 1981 and resulted in its inventors receiving the Nobel Prize in physics a short five years later .
STM relies on quantum mechanical tunneling effects ; as the microscope 's tip is scanned over a surface , electrons tunnel from the tip into the surface , the tunneling current is measured and can be transformed into an image .
STMs are capable of imaging particles as small across as 1 angstrom and can measure changes in height as small as 0.1 angstroms .
The image to the right is an STM image of a gold surface ; the individual gold atoms are clearly visible .
One of the biggest drawbacks of STM is speed : while the current between the tip and surface can change in a nanosecond , it takes considerably longer to image properly — typical speeds are on the order of 10 kilohertz .
New research , reported in last week 's edition of Nature , from groups at Boston University and Cornell University have devised a simple modification that is capable of greatly speeding up the operation of a STM .
The researchers found that by adding an external radio frequency ( RF ) source to the setup that they could measure the resistance at the tunneling junction .
This measurement is carried out by examining the characteristics of the wave that gets reflected back to the RF source .
With knowledge of the junction resistance , the researchers can easily deduce the distance between the tip and the surface .
This method allowed for 100 to 1000 fold increase in measurement speeds .
The researchers who developed this technique have dubbed their modified method as RF - STM , they believe that this technique will be applicable to a number of scientific and technological problems .
Since the technique is so simple , the researchers list three reasons that this will be an attractive method : only minor modifications are needed to an STM , the needed RF components are easy to obtain , and finally the added RF circuit can work under a wide variety of conditions .
In addition to developing the novel method , the researchers discuss some of the more incredible applications that this technique could make possible .
The researchers discuss how this setup can be used for atomic scale thermometry — measuring the temperature of just a few atoms .
This would allow a scientist or engineer to easily study the nanoscale heat flow in an advanced semiconductor chip .
Since heat flow is the limiting factor in clock speeds and densities , such rapid scale thermal imaging would provide a useful analysis tool .
In the closing paragraph of the article the authors state that " electron tunneling is expected to enable quantum mechanically - limited position detection . "
Basically the device could be used to measure distances at the edge of measurability according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle .
" This STM will be used for a lot of good physics experiments , " said article author K.C. Schwab .
" Once you open up this new parameter , all this bandwidth , people will figure out ways to use it .
I firmly believe 10 years from now there will be a lot of RF - STMs around , and people will do all kinds of great experiments with them . "

Search Engine Optimization and Marketing ( SEO / SEM ) .
Everyone is talking about it .
( We are ! )
Many business owners know the power of ranking high on the search engine results page .
More and more continue to realize it everyday .
Every business wants to be at the top of Google and Yahoo ’s search results .
The number 1 spot for a search term gets about 50 % more clicks than the second result , and that could mean the difference between making and breaking your business online .
Because of this desire to rank high , it ’s easy to get sold on empty promises .
Unfortunately , there are a lot of shady companies out there that offer services that do nothing but waste your time and money .
There are things to look for to tell whether a search optimization and marketing company is going to help your business , or just plain sell you snake oil .
This article will get into the “ red flags ” to look for that should make you run for the hills .
The company uses Google Adsense or other contextual advertising on their site
Contextual advertising , like Google ’s Adsense , is a great way for web site owners to make money from their web site .
They are blocks of ads that make them money every time someone clicks on them .
If the web site ’s purpose is to provide information in the form of articles , or provide a free service , then contextual advertising is great for providing income for the web site owner .
But why would a search company , or any business web site for that matter , have contextual advertising on it ?
If they ’re really trying to grow and promote their business , why would they allow competitors to advertise on their own web site ?
It dilutes their message and shows that they ’re more concerned about making a quick buck than staying in business for the long term .
The company promotes Web Site Submission to hundreds of search engines
This is probably the biggest “ snake oil ” service out there .
If a search company is promoting “ submission to hundreds of search engines , ” they ’re still stuck in the 1996 .
Today , there are only 4 search engines that get the huge majority of traffic : Google , Yahoo , MSN , and Ask .
And the algorithms ( technology ) of today ’s search engines are complex enough to find your web site without having to submit it to them .
This worked well 10 years ago when there were hundreds of search engines out there .
But over time , the landscape of search has tightened up .
Now , any reputable search marketing company must focus on ranking your business in the major search engines , rather than wasting resources on the 1 % of leftover search traffic .
Web site submission only needs to be used for brand new web sites , and you only need to submit to the major four .
It ’s Too Good to be True !
“ Get ranked # 1 in Google for $ 49.95 ! ”
“ Rank your web site in the Top 3 Positions for $ 99 in less than a week ! ”
Getting a web site ranked for anything is tough work .
It ’s certainly not rocket science , but it is a time consuming task that requires thoughtful planning and hard work .
There is a lot competition out there , and it grows every single day .
Any company that can promise top rankings on the major search engines for pennies is likely full of it .
There are only 2 ways that a search company can deliver on these false promises .
1 ) They got very , very lucky .
2 . ) They are using shady , bad practices .
Spamming a web site to the top of the search results may work for a week or so , but eventually your web site will get busted and you could get de-listed from Google , Yahoo , MSN , and Ask all together .
When it ’s “ Too Good to be True , ” it ’s eventually going to catch up with you and hurt your business , and your wallet .
No Permanent E-mail Address / Web Site / Contact Information
Any reputable search company will have a web site , and if they do they will have an e-mail address with the web site address in it .
If you ’ve received an e-mail promoting search optimization and marketing services from an e-mail account that ends in @gmail.com , @msn.com , @yahoo.com , etc. , then run away !
They ’re either not serious about what they do , or just spamming you to make a quick buck with a throw away e-mail address .
If they do have a web site , but you ’re finding it hard to find any credible contact information , be weary .
An e-mail address is n’t good enough .
They should at least have a phone number , physical mailing address , or employee profiles so you know they are legitimate .
They “ Add / Optimize Meta Keywords and Descriptions ” for a ridiculous fee
Meta Keywords and Descriptions are hidden tags on your web pages that describe each page with keywords and a lengthy description .
They were important many years ago , but were abused by spammers .
Today , they should still be used but they hold very little influence on your rankings .
Adding or optimizing Meta tags should be a standard practice for a good search optimization and marketing company .
If they ’re writing your page titles and web page content , then adding Meta tags is a semi-automatic task .
Stay away from any company that simply promotes adding or optimizing Meta tags for hundreds or thousands of dollars , especially if they ’re not going to touch anything else on your web site .
Conclusion
As the search optimization and marketing industry grows , there will be more and more shady companies out there that will promote services that do nothing but waste your time , your money , and put your business web site at risk .
On the bright side , as the search industry standardizes , there will be more , easier ways to find reputable search engine optimization and marketing companies .
You will be OK if you do your homework by comparing companies , reading testimonials , and talking to the people that work there .

With 53 seats in the US House of Representatives , California has long dominated congressional and electoral politics .
Now mathematician Paul Edelman says that a much - needed rehaul of the way these seats are assigned would knock them down three notches .
Edelman , who is also a law professor at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee , is proposing a different method for apportionment , the process that divvies up the 435 congressional representatives based on state populations .
He claims his method is fairer than the existing one because it comes closest to the " one person , one vote " ideal set forth by the US Supreme Court .
The current method " takes no account of what the law has to say " , argues Edelman , who outlined his method in a talk on 6 January at the Joint Mathematics Meetings in San Diego , California .
The electoral map is basically constructed by looking at population numbers that are tallied every decade by the US Census Bureau .
A state 's percentage of the national population should be reflected in its percentage of seats in the House .
But this results in a lot of fractional numbers of seats that need to be cleaned up .
Over US history , four main mathematical methods have been used to do this , all with various strengths and weaknesses .
One for you , one for me
The Hamilton method , used from 1850 until 1900 , is the simplest .
In this method , an ' ideal ' district size is determined by dividing the US population by 435 ( the number of seats ) .
The state populations are then divided by this ideal size to find their deserved fraction of seats .
In 2000 , for example , California was entitled to a quota of 52.44 seats .
The states are then ordered by the size of their fractional remainders .
Those with the biggest remainder are the first to be rounded up and given an extra representative .
Remaining seats are distributed , down the list , until all 435 seats are meted out .
The other methods round up or down without regard to rank .
But this can easily result in a total of more or less than 435 seats .
So then the ' ideal ' district size is adjusted and the numbers re-crunched until the right number of seats comes out of the mix .
These methods — Jefferson , Webster and the current one , Huntington - Hill , which has been in effect since the 1940 census — use different rounding points .
For example , the Huntington - Hill method rounds up or down from the geometric mean of the nearest integers ( so if California deserves 52.44 seats it is rounded down , as the geometric mean of 52 and 53 is 52.4976 ) .
Since the geometric mean is proportionally larger for higher numbers , the current method has an inherent bias towards giving small states a boost up — something Edelman and others have criticized .
Minimally unfair
Edelman 's method is instead designed to minimize the difference between the most over - represented state and the most under - represented one , in terms of the difference between the actual number of people per representative and the ideal number .
This is done through an iterative process that evaluates 385 scenarios to find this minimum total deviation .
He argues that this comes closest to matching the ideal of “ one person , one vote ” .
Using his method for populations in 2000 , Montana , Delaware , South Dakota , Utah and Mississippi would each gain one seat ; Texas , New York , Florida , Ohio and North Carolina would lose one ; and California would lose three .
“ That could very well freak people out , ” says Edelman .
The method is “ interesting ” but has a few problems , says Don Saari , director of the Institute for Mathematical Behavioral Sciences at the University of California at Irvine .
The method has even more of a bias towards small states than the existing method , he argues .
And it does n't necessarily come up with unique solutions — there could be many ways to achieve equal ' unfairness ' .
And , like the current method , it can overshoot and adjust a state 's seat up or down by more than one vote .

Saari prefers the simplicity of the Hamilton method , which is the only one that ensures a state wo n’t be rounded up or down past the nearest integer .
As the populations of big states grow and those of small ones shrink , Saari says , the over - and undershooting of the current method will become more pronounced — and certain states will probably complain .
“ I expect we ’ll see challenge after challenge , ” he says .
That probably wo n’t happen until the next census in 2010 – when the winners and losers under the new population counts become apparent .
Then the bickering will begin , Edelman says .
It 's good to be prepared for that , he adds , with a good analysis of the various options available .
" I was spending time every week trying to keep the machine free of viruses and worms , " said Mr. Tucker , a vice president of Salesforce.com , a Web services firm based here .
" I was losing the battle .
It was cheaper and faster to go to the store and buy a low - end PC . "
In the face of a constant stream of pop-up ads , malfunctioning programs and performance slowed to a crawl or a crash -- the hallmarks of spyware and adware -- throwing out a computer " is a rational response , " said Lee Rainie , director of the Pew Internet and American Life Project , a Washington - based research group that studies the Internet 's social impact .
While no figures are available on the ranks of those jettisoning their PC's , the scourge of unwanted software is widely felt .
This month the Pew group published a study in which 43 percent of the 2,001 adult Internet users polled said they had been confronted with spyware or adware , collectively known as malware .
Forty - eight percent said they had stopped visiting Web sites that might deposit unwanted programs on their PC's .
Moreover , 68 percent said they had had computer trouble in the last year consistent with the problems caused by spyware or adware , though 60 percent of those were unsure of the problems ' origins .
Twenty percent of those who tried to fix the problem said it had not been solved ; among those who spent money seeking a remedy , the average outlay was $ 129 .
By comparison , it is possible to buy a new computer , including a monitor , for less than $ 500 , though more powerful systems can cost considerably more .
Jackpot or Mistake ?
Man Sues Over $ 1.6M ' Jackpot '
The casino has refused to pay , calling the " jackpot " a computer malfunction .
Oct. 25 , 2007  --
For about an hour last August , Gary Hoffman was a very lucky man .
Hoffman was playing the nickel slot machines at the Sandia Resort and Casino on an Indian reservation in New Mexico when he appeared to hit the jackpot : the machine said he won nearly $ 1.6 million .
" I became ecstatic , " he said .
But the ecstasy was short - lived .
Hoffman says in a lawsuit filed earlier this year that Sandia refused to pay , claiming that the machine malfunctioned .
Instead , he said , they gave him about $ 385 and a few free meals at the casino .
" I won money , fair and square , and I 've been cheated out of my winnings , " Hoffman told ABC News .
The casino says it 's not responsible for what it describes as a computer error and says it offered Hoffman the maximum payout of $ 2,500 for that particular slot machine .
But , a jury may never decide who is right .
Lawyers told ABC
News that gamblers like Hoffman may have little legal recourse against Native American casinos , which sometimes operate beyond the reach of U.S. courts .
' I Was a Winner '
Hoffman , a retired Albuquerque city employee , was playing a " Mystical Mermaid " slot machine on the morning of Aug. 16 , 2006 , when he thought he hit it big .
The nickel slot said he'd won $ 1,597,244.10 .
Patrons and casino employees came to congratulate him .
He even got a marriage proposal , Hoffman said .
But , soon he was asked to come to an executive conference room , where he says he was told the casino refused to pay .
A casino employee " became quite intimidating with me , pointed his finger in my face and said , ' You did n't win .
We 're not paying you any money .
Do you understand what I 'm telling you ?
You 're not getting any money , ' " Hoffman said .
A technician from the slot machine manufacturer arrived at the casino within the hour and the casino cordoned off the machine .
" I was a winner and I walked out empty handed , " Hoffman said .
Computer Malfunction
A technical report said the slot machine 's computer malfunctioned , and incorrectly made it appear as if Hoffman won more than the machine is able to pay out .
The slot machine has a disclaimer that says it pays a maximum of $ 2,500 and warns that malfunctions void all winnings , said Paul Bardacke , Sandia 's lawyer .
The technical report , prepared for the casino by Gaming Laboratories International , showed that the machine 's memory malfunctioned , causing the slot to treat a losing spin as a winner -- what the report called an " erroneous jackpot . "
The machine manufacturer , International Gaming Technology , blamed the problem on a software program .
Bardacke said Sandia offered Hoffman the maximum payout of $ 2,500 .
" If he had gone into a bank and deposited $ 1,000 and got back a deposit slip that said a million dollars , he does n't get to keep the balance , " said Bardacke .
" It does n't work that way . "
" He knew it was wrong ; he knew it was incorrect , " Bardacke said of the " jackpot . "
" That 's why he took a picture of it immediately . "
Hoffman appealed through the tribe 's internal review process but lost .
Then he took the casino to court .
Jeremy Kleiman , the vice chairman of the commercial gaming subcommittee of the American Bar Association , said that courts normally look at the player 's expectations when deciding disputes about gambling .
" The information seemed to indicate this was a stand alone slot machine with a maximum payout of $ 2,500 , " he said .
" So when you sit down your expectation is to win no more than $ 2,500 .
This is not a fraud situation where a carrot was fraudulently dangled in front of a customer 's face . "
Hoffman contends that the machine went into bonus play , which he said would have given him amplified winnings .
The GLI report , however , says that the machine was already going haywire when it went into the bonus rounds , and the casino maintains the maximum jackpot was $ 2,500 .
Sovereign Immunity
Regardless , a jury may never get chance to hear Hoffman 's case .
Native American tribes , as independent nations , have their own court systems and can be sued in state courts only under limited circumstances .
New Mexico law generally does not allow tribes to be sued in a state court over a contract dispute , Kleiman said .
Hoffman 's lawyers say they should be able to sue the tribe over what they call big business .
" They spent millions of dollars getting these customers , these gamblers , to come in and gamble money , then when someone hits it big , they say , ' Sorry , we are not going to pay you , " said Hoffman 's lawyer , Sam Bregman .
" The jury is going to be outraged by that . "
If the case does make it into court , expect more wrangling over who is ultimately responsible for the malfunction .
GLI , hired by the casino to test the slot machine , said that the jackpot was caused by a problem with the machine 's memory .
A spokesman for International Gaming Technology blamed a separate software program for the mix - up -- something GLI 's technicians say is not possible .
As for Hoffman , Sandia officials say he has visited the casino more than 70 times in the first six months of 2007 , a claim Hoffman did not dispute .
Cases like Hoffman 's may still be bad for business , gambling experts say .
" The players have to have an enormous amount of trust in the casino and in the slot machine , " said slot machine expert John Robison .
" The player can not go inside and look at that random number generator and figure out what really happened on the machine , " he said .
" If the machine tells you you won , well then I think you 've won . "

Bartman , 27 , has never said a word beyond the statement .
He has vanished from the public eye , like a perfectly executed trip into the witness - protection program .
Is he still a Cubs fan ?
Is he married ?
How has he dealt with having his name associated with the biggest failure in his favorite team 's dubious baseball history ?
I wanted to know .
Deep down , every Cubs fan wants to know .
This is why I 'm in Chicago .
The research begins
I start by throwing Bartman 's name into Google , which is putting a cramp into the business of private investigators everywhere .
The results are sickening .
" Death to Steve Bartman " message boards .
Blogs that encourage Cubs fans to , " not let him do this to us " and to " seek revenge . "
Then there are the doctored photos .
Bartman hiding in Saddam Hussein 's bunker .
Bartman pushing the button that set off the World Trade Center bombings .
Bartman holding a match to the Hindenburg explosion .
And a mug shot with Bartman as the lead suspect in the Washington , D.C. , sniper shootings .
There are T - shirts : " Sit Down Steve . "
" The Curse Lives -- Thanks Steve . "
And , " Cub fan Rule No. 1 : Keep both hands on your Old Style . "
And then this shirt , mocking the MasterCard " priceless " commercials :
Tickets to Cubs game : $ 200
Chicago Cubs hat : $ 20
1987 Walkman : $ 10
F-----g up your team 's chances of winning the World Series : Priceless
No wonder Bartman has gone into hiding , using his press release as his only public words .
No wonder his family and friends protect him like an innocent family member who has been accused of a crime he did n't commit .
Armed with stacks of information , I move to the telephone .
I start calling people who know people who know Bartman .
Names from old stories , people who commented on television in the days after the infamous night , people who know people .
The old friend of a friend of a friend trick seems to get the job done in my line of work , but each time I reach someone close to Bartman , I get nowhere .
Now I know why .
" I 'd really like to tell you Steve 's a great guy , " a college friend of his from Notre Dame tells me .
" But I 'd rather Steve not know I talked to a reporter . "
And if I do n't use a name ?
" He still could figure it out , " he tells me .
" And it 's not worth it .
He has been through enough . "
His co-workers at an international consulting firm , including my mother 's former co-worker 's current co-worker 's son ( hey , the Six Degrees of Steve Bartman was worth a shot ) , wo n't return my calls .
Most of the people in his neighborhood refuse to talk .
Only his next - door neighbor Ron Cohen , through his explanation of why I should " leave Bartman alone " and not " bring back uncomfortable wounds of the past , " says much of anything .
Cohen has spoken about his neighbor in the past , on morning talk shows and in television interviews , and clearly does n't want to continue being one of the few glimpses into Bartman 's life .
But he does , but only because I refuse to hang up , talking about the Cubs , the weather , anything I can to keep him on the phone .
" Look , " Cohen says .
" He 's doing well now .
He 's fine .
He leads a normal life , as far as I know .
Every so often , I see him head into the house , I wave , ask how he 's doing and he always smiles back . "
What about the rumors that he was transferred to London ?
Or that he had plastic surgery ?
Or shaved his head ?
Any of it true ?
Cohen laughs .
" What a farce , " he says .
" Every rumor I hear I do n't run next door and check to see if it 's true because none of them are true . "
" Now go on with your life , " he tells me , his tone sounding like a father encouraging his son to put dreams of being a private detective behind him .
" There 's more important things in the world than the Cubs . "
This time I laugh .
Although it 's beginning to seem that it would be easier to get into George W. Bush 's inner circle than make contact with Bartman , I 'm too far into the search to quit now .
Does anybody care ?
Close your eyes and picture life as Steve Bartman .
Imagine the Cubs being the core of your existence and having your name and photo right alongside the billy goats and black cats of past Cubs failures .
Imagine the realization you likely will never visit Wrigley Field again .
Your eyes will never gaze upon the dark green ivy , bright green scoreboard or muted brown bricks .
Imagine turning on a random St. Louis Cardinals game , watching Albert Pujols chase a foul ball into the front row at Busch Stadium and listening as it sparks a 10 - minute conversation about you .
It 's enough to prompt a swoon into a lifetime of unspeakable depression .
To better understand the pain , I call the psychology departments at Northwestern and the University of Chicago .
They do n't seem interested in local problems , so I enlist the help of Dr. Richard Lustberg , a New York - based sports psychologist who has worked with everyone from Little Leaguers to major leaguers in his 30 years practicing and studying sports psychology .
Lustberg has never met with Bartman , never spoken with him .
But he insists he can help me .
His ego is immense .
He tells me that if ESPN flies him to Chicago , he can convince Bartman to join us on a trip to Wrigley Field .
I tell him he 's nuts .
" It 's what I do for a living , " Lustberg explains .
" I get people to talk .
Just give me a shot . "
I politely decline , but press him for insight into Bartman 's head .
The way Lustberg talks , with his authoritative , non - stop psychobabble , he sounds like he has the entire situation figured out .
" He simply loved the Cubs too much , " Lustberg takes 15 minutes of premium couch time to explain .
" That 's why it hurts . "
I argue that it 's impossible .
That if Bartman loves the Cubs too much , then I love the Cubs too much .
" That 's why you think this is such a big deal , " Lustberg said .
" But in the grand scheme of things , it is n't .
Nobody cares .
And that 's what I would try to tell Steve . "
Preposterous .
Clearly , the lifelong New Yorker does n't get Chicago sports .
Bartman 's blunder is one of the biggest sports stories in the Windy City 's modern sports history .
Jordan 's six championships , Super Bowl XX , Sosa 's Summer of '98 and Bartman .
But Lustberg does n't budge .
He challenges me to ask 100 random Chicagoans -- white , black , young , old -- if the name Steve Bartman means anything to them .
He contends less than half of the city will recognize the name .
I laugh again , hang up the phone and head to Blues Fest , a melting pot of Chicago 's multicultural diversity in Grant Park .
On this humid , overcast Sunday , the park is filled with more than 100,000 people .
I talk to everyone from homeless men begging for change to the economically elite sipping on wine and nibbling on cheese .
I talk to police officers , preachers , garbage men , yuppies , even four Indian women sitting on a park bench bobbing their heads to the blues .
I ask every single one of them , 100 people total : " Does the name Steve Bartman mean anything to you ? "
Twenty - seven say yes .
Seventy - three say no .
One " no " is a guy wailing on a harmonica in a tattered Cubs hat .
When I clue him in that Bartman has something to do with the Cubs , he still can't guess .
" I just wear the hat , " he says .
Cracking the code of silence
Lustberg had helped me , but in the wrong way .
His argument was that nobody cared .
I argue Cubs fans care .
Plus , I care immensely , and that burden must be eased .
I soldier on and put in a call to Jeff Lashey , an executive vice president and crisis management expert at Edelman , one of the world 's top public relations firms .
PR agencies usually are the enemy in stories such as this , always looking to place things in a positive spin .
Good PR is about staying on message , but with Bartman the message is doom .
So I go straight for the jugular , seeking to learn how they would advise Bartman if he hired them .
Lashey is downright energized about my call , a break from the monotony of helping Fortune 500 companies overcome PR disasters .
He begins by analyzing Bartman 's statement .
According to the expert , the message was flawless .
" It was very personal , with his own real feelings and emotions in it , " Lashey said .
" And that 's an effective way to deliver your message .
He did it right . "
So right , that Lashey says Bartman has every right to not talk to me .
Or anyone else for that matter .
" It depends how much he wants to bleed his heart , " Lashey said .
" If he feels he needs to further convey what this has all been like for him , then maybe I would say do a select interview .
If he 's still struggling with how he 's going to live his life and this is just going to re-ignite the pain , then maybe you do n't go that route . "
But in this day and age , everybody talks .
From victims of child abuse to mistresses of convicted murderers , everyone ends up telling their stories to " Dateline , " or " 20/20 " or " Entertainment Tonight . "
With offers from media outlets across the nation , why would Bartman be any different ?
We 're approaching the two - year mark .
Surely , it 's time for his story to be told .
Lashey , a former television reporter , can't keep the instincts from his previous job from kicking in .
In one sentence he blows up the argument from the shrink and further fuels the fire that people still care .
" If I were a sportswriter , I 'd do what I could to get him to talk to me , " Lashey said .
" Because whether he wants to admit it or not , that one play may have changed the course of baseball history .
" I was sick when I watched that happen .
Absolutely sick to my stomach .
But I still want to know what happened to him . "
The Stakeout
I need to find Bartman .
See him .
Know if he 's doing as well as his neighbor suggests .
So , I head to his parents ' home in Chicago 's comfortable north suburbs .
Although many offspring leave the nest as they close in on their 30s , I have pieced together the fact Bartman currently lives at home .
The address is easy to find -- it 's still plastered all over the Internet .
So armed with the facts and just the facts , I head out a little before 7 a.m. on a quiet Friday .
I head from city to suburbs , finally making my way down a quiet , peaceful street Norman Rockwell would have painted .
Dozens of members of Congress sent a letter Tuesday to the chief executive of Mattel , accusing the company of not living up to its promise to keep lead - tainted toys out of children ’s hands .
The letter was prompted by Mattel ’s decision not to issue a nationwide recall of a blood - pressure cuff in a toy medical kit sold under the Fisher - Price brand .
The legislators said they were disturbed by the company ’s “ lack of action . ”
Lead was found in a plastic part of the toy , and current federal laws ban lead only in paint on toys .
Lawmakers are considering a law to limit lead in all material in toys .
The letter , signed by 56 members of Congress , quoted Mattel ’s chief executive , Robert A. Eckert , as saying in September that the company “ will do the right thing . ”
“ We challenge you to live up to your words , ” it said , “ and set a standard for the entire industry by completely eliminating the use of lead in all the children ’s products manufactured by Mattel . ”
Below is a transcript of testimony in the Japanese Parliament that was broadcast live nationwide on NHK television .
The Member of Parliament talking about 911 is Yukihisa Fujita from the Democratic Party of Japan .
After the testimony Mr. Fujita says he got lots of phone calls from other members of Parliament thanking him for having the bravery to bring up 911 in Parliament .
He also got one death threat .
Meanwhile , I asked the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan to invite him for a press conference .
Each of several attempts to send an e-mail to the FCCJ about this resulting in my hotmail account freezing and my computer crashing .
Also , it was amazing to watch the shameless verbal acrobatics of American corporate journalists trying to prevent this press conference from taking place .
Fortunately , journalists from the rest of the world supported a press conference and we will try to get it to take place as soon as possible .
The secret government 's control of Japan is falling apart .
A few weeks ago one of Japan 's leading commercial TV networks also broadcast a 911 truth program during prime time .
One other national network and several local networks have also broadcast such programs .
The people of Japan do not want to finance genocidal mass murderers any more /// Head of the committee :
We will now begin the first session of the defense and foreign affairs committee .
We will now start discussing the special anti-terror law .
.
We now call on Mr. Yukihisa Fujita Fujita standing in front of microphone : .
This will be the last televised broadcast of this committee for so I would like to talk about the origin of the war on terrorism which was the attacks of 911 .
On September 11 of 2002 I went to a theater house for a charity concert to help build a school in Afghanistan .
They chose to have the charity concert on that day as a gesture of respect for the dead .
Normally 911 commemorative events are for the people who died in New York but the people who held this event decided that more innocent people died as a result of 911 in Afghanistan than in New York .
So they built a grade school near where the statue of Buddha was destroyed in Bamiyan .
The name of the school is " the school of hope . "
They also lit candles to commemorate the dead both in Afghanistan and in New York in the year 2002 , one year after the attacks .
So , when discussing these anti-terror laws we should ask ourselves , what was 911 , what is terrorism ?
So today , I would like to talk about the beginning of the war on terror .
So , I would like to ask the people who call this law an anti-terror law to realize that the biggest victim of the war on terrorism has been Afghanistan so I believe helping the people of Afghanistan should be our biggest priority .
I would like to ask Mr. Inuzuka about this .
Tadashi Inuzuka walking to the microphone : As Mr. Fujita says the main purpose of this law is to provide peace and security to Afghanistan .
And , as he says , the biggest sufferers have been the people of Afghanistan .
Afghanistan has 1.7 times the land area of Japan and 20 some million people live there .
Also , because of a drought on the Eurasian continent close to 5 million have died due to water shortages .
Even now 1 million people live close to the main battlegrounds .
So , the main purpose is to provide stability to those war zones so in that context what should Japan do ?
However , instead of providing support by providing fuel to the U.S. forces we at the Democratic Party have decided that providing water is more important .
The philosophy behind our anti-terror law is to get the ruling party to help deal with this problem .
Head of the committee : Mr. Fujita Mr. Fujita : I would like to talk about the origins of this war on terrorism .
You may recall that in November I asked you if terrorism was war or if it was a crime .
And the whole start of this war on terrorism was 911 .
What I want to know is if this event was caused by Al Qaeda or not .
So far the only thing the government has said is that we think it was caused by Al Qaeda because President Bush told us so .
We have not seen any real proof that it was Al Qaeda .
I would like to know why the Prime Minister thinks it was the Taliban who was responsible for 911 .
Committee Chief , I want to ask the Prime Minister because he was chief cabinet officer at the time .
Prime Minister Fukuda :
Since the attacks we have communicated with the U.S. government and other governments at different levels and exchanged information .
According to secret information obtained by our government and reports put together by foreign governments the 911 attacks were carried out by the international terrorist organization known as Al Qaeda .
Mr. Fujita :
So , you are talking about both secret and disclosed information .
My question is has the Japanese government carried out its own investigation using the police and other resources ?
It is a crime so surely an investigation needs to be carried out .
When a Japanese journalist was shot in Myanmar you carried out an investigation .
In the same way over 20 Japanese people died on 911 so surely the government carried out its own investigation and decided that Al Qaeda was responsible .
So , what kind of investigation did you carry out ?
At the time you were Chief Cabinet Secretary so surely you would know better than anybody so I want to ask you about your investigation .
Prime Minister Fukuda : After the 911 attacks the National Police Agency sent an emergency anti-terror team to New York .
They met with U.S. government officials and gathered information about missing Japanese .
Mr. Fujita :
So you are saying over 20 people died as a result of a crime and most of those people were working in New York .
Also there were some Japanese who died in the four airplanes that were hijacked .
I would like to know exactly how many people died in the buildings and how many died in the airplanes .
I also want to know how you confirmed this .
I would like the Foreign Minister to answer for me .
Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura standing at right in front of microphone :
We found the bodies of over a dozen Japanese following the simultaneous terror attacks carried out on September 11 2001 .
We were also informed about the death of 11 more people by the U.S. authorities .
In total 24 Japanese died in those attacks .
Of those 2 were in the airplanes .
Mr. Fujita : I would like to ask what flights the two Japanese who died in the airplanes were on and how you determined who they were .
If the foreign minister does not know it is OK to get a bureaucrat to answer : Foreign Ministry division chief Ryoji Tanizaki :
Since this a question of fact , I will answer .
As the Foreign Minister said , of the 24 people who died two were on the airplanes .
One of them was on United Flight 93 and the other was on American airlines flight 11 .
As for how we know this , well I do not have the information in front of me but we were told by U.S. authorities and , in general , they use DNA testing .
So we believe that is how we know about those two people .
Mr. Fujita :
So you are saying you do not know because you do not have the documents .
Also , you say you believe there was DNA testing but you do not know .
So what I want to say today is that this was a crime and crimes are supposed to be investigated .
So the government needs to inform the victims families of the results of their investigation .
Also , instead of just observing the anniversary of 911 every year you must be gathering information and reacting to it .
So , during the past six years have you been supplying the families of the deceased with information ?
I would like to ask the Foreign Minister to answer .
Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura :
So you do not want to ask any more about how we confirmed the deaths of Japanese but want to know about reports to the victims families ?
We provided the families with information about the bodies and about compensation funds .
Also , for the 13 Japanese whose remains we found , we helped the families deal with the bodies .
We also financial support visits to the World Trade Center site for the families on every anniversary .
Mr. Fujita : Since
I do not have much time I would like to ask about the suspicious information being uncovered and the doubts people world wide are having about the events of 911 .
Many of these doubters are very influential people .
In such circumstances I believe the Japanese government , which claims the attacks were carried out by Al Qaeda , should be providing the victims families with this new information .
In that context I would like to ask several questions .
First of all I would like to get all members of the committee to look at this panel and look at the pictures I have provided you with .
This is concrete evidence in the form of photographs and other types of information .
The first photograph has computer graphics attached to show how large the plane that hit the Pentagon was .
A 757 is quite a large airplane with a width of 38 meters .
So as you can see even though such a large plane hit the pentagon there is only a hole that is too small for the airplane .
This is a photograph taken of firemen at work and you can also see there is no damage of the sort an airplane that large should make .
I would also like you to look at the lawn in front and notice that there are no airplane parts on it .
Let us now look at the third picture , which is also of the pentagon taken from a U.S. TV news report has captions that show the roof of the Pentagon is still intact .
Again even though a huge airplane is supposed to have hit , there is not enough corresponding damage .
Now let us move to the next photograph .
Here is a photograph of a hole , as Minister Komura knows the Pentagon is a very strong building with many walls .
Yet the airplane has pierced them .
But as you know , airplanes are made of the lightest possible material .
An airplane made of such light material could not make a hole like that .
Next I would like to show a photograph of how the airplane hit the building .
The airplane made a U - turn , avoiding the Defense Secretary 's office and hitting the only part of the Pentagon that had been specially reinforced to withstand a bomb attack .
Also , in the middle of page five we have a comment from a U.S. airforce official .
He says I have flown the two types of airplane used on 911 and I cannot believe it would be possible for someone who is flying one for the first time to be able to carry out such a maneuver .
Also , as you know , they have not recovered the flight recorders from most of these 4 airplanes .
Also , there were more than 80 security cameras at the Pentagon but they have refused to release almost all of the footage .
In any case , as you have just seen there is no picture of the airplane or of its wreckage in any of these photographs .
It is very strange that no such pictures have been shown to us .
As you know Japan 's self - defense forces have their headquarters in Ichigaya .
Can you imagine if an airplane hit a major city , if an hour and a half after an airplane hit New York that an airplane could hit the Pentagon ?
In such a situation how could our allies allow such an attack to take place .
I would like the Defense Minister to answer this .
Defense Minister Fuyushiba Ishiba : I have not prepared so I will have to answer ad - lib .
If such a situation took place then the airforce would send fighters up to shoot down any airplanes .
This is what happened with an attack on the German constitutional court .
In the case of Japan our reaction would depend on what kind of airplane it was , who was flying it and what their purpose was .
However , according to our laws it might be hard to order an airplane to be shot down just because it was flying at a low level .
We would probably have self - defense forces fly with it and ask for a cabinet decision .
Since an airplane would have many people on board we would have do discuss what to do .
This happened a long time ago but a Cesna airplane was flown into the house of a person called Yoshio Kodama .
There was also an All Japan Airways flight bound for Hakodate that was hijacked and had the pilot killed .
It would be best if such a thing never happened but we need to prepare new laws for such situations and discuss them in Parliament .
Mr. Fujita :
Since we are running out of time I would like to present a new piece of evidence .
Please look at this panel .
The first picture is one you see often of the two towers that were hit by hijacked airplanes .
I could understand if this happened right after the airplanes hit but here we can see large piece of material flying a large distance through the air .
Some flew 150 meters .
You can objects flying in this picture as if there was an explosion .
Here is a picture I took from a book .
This lets you see how far the objects flew .
The third picture is of a fireman who was involved in the rescue talking about a series of explosions in the building that sounded like a professional demolition .
We cannot present video today so I have written a translation of what the fireman said .
Here his is saying " it went boom boom boom like explosions were going off . "
Here is something said by a Japanese research team of officials from the fire department and the construction ministry .
The interviewed a Japanese survivor who said that while she was fleeing there were explosions .
This testimony appears in a report prepared with the aid of the construction ministry and the fire department .
Now I would like you to see the following picture .
Normally it is said that the twin towers collapsed because they were hit by airplanes .
However , one block away from the twin towers is building number 7 .
It can be seen in the following map a block away from the WTC .
This building collapsed 7 hours after the WTC buildings were attacked .
If I could show you a video it would be easy to understand but take a look at this photograph .
This is a 47 story building that fell in this manner ( He drops and object to demonstrate ) .
The building falls in five or six seconds .
It is about the same speed as an object would fall in a vacuum .
This building falls like something you would see in a Kabuki show .
Also if falls while keeping its shape .
Remember it was not hit by an airplane .
You have to ask yourself if a building could fall in that manner due to a fire after 7 hours .
Here we have a copy of the 911 commission report .
This is a report put out by the U.S. government in July of 2004 but this report does not mention the collapse of the building I just described .
It is not mentioned at all in here ( he waves the book ) .
FEMA also issued a report but they also fail to mention this building .
Many people believe , especially after seeing the story about building number 7 , that something is strange .
Since this is an incident where many people died people think is should be investigated .
We are running out of time but I would also like to mention the put options .
Just before the 911 attacks , ie on September 6th , 7th and 8th there were put options put out on the stocks of the two airlines United and American that were hit by hijackers .
There were also put options on Merril Lynch , one of the biggest WTC tenants .
In other words somebody had insider information and made a fortune selling put options of these stocks .
The head of Germany 's Bundesbank at the time , who is equivalent to the Governor of the Bank of Japan , said there are lots of facts to prove the people involved in the terror attacks profited from insider information .
He said there was lots of suspicious trading involving financial companies etc prior to the attacks .
The had of the Bundesbank was willing to say this much .
I would like to ask the Finance Minster about these put options .
Did the government of Japan know about this , and what do you think about this ?
I would like to ask Finance Minister Nukaga about this .
Finance Minister Fukushiro Nukaga : I was in Burkina Fasso in Africa when I heard about this incident .
I decided to fly immediately to the U.S. but when I got to Paris I was told there were no flights to America .
So I only heard what was reported later about the facts .
I know there have been reports about the points you raise .
So we made it obligatory that people provide ID for securities transactions and for suspicious transactions to be reported and we made it a crime to provide money to terrorist organizations .
We believe the international financial system should not be abused .
In any case , terrorism is a horrible thing and must be condemned .
This type of terrorism cannot be stopped by one country but needs to be stopped by international society .
Mr. Fujita : I would like to ask finance specialist Mr. Asao to tell me about put options .
A group of people with large amounts of money , clear insider information and financial expertise would have been necessary for such a thing to take place .
Could a few terrorists in Afghanistand and Pakistan carry out such a sophisticated and large scale set of transactions ?
I would like to ask Mr. Asao to respond .
Keiichiro Asao : I understand put options are a deal to sell stocks at a fixed price .
In this case somebody must have had insider information to carry out such transactions because nobody could normally predict these airlines would have their planes hijacked .
So , I believe this was certainly a case of insider trading .
Mr. Fujita : Prime Minister , you were Chief Cabinet Secretary at the time and as somebody has already noted , this was an incident of the sort that humanity had never previously experienced .
Also , there appears to be a lot more information about this incident coming out now than came out in the months after the attacks .
Now that we are an internet and visual society , this information is being made public so if we look at the situation now , the whole starting point for these two laws , the start of the war on terror itself , as you have seen from the information I have presented , has not been properly investigated or analyzed .
So I do not believe the government has acted properly by investigating this incident or asking the U.S. government for an explanation .
So far we have not started refueling U.S. ships yet so I think we need to go back to the beginning and not just simply and blindly trust the U.S. government explanation and indirect information provided by them .
There were too many victims so I think we need to start again from the beginning .
We need to ask who the real victims of this war on terrorism are .
I think the citizens of the world are its victims .
Here in Japan we have disappearing pensions and disappearing records about victims of Hepatitis C contaminated blood but everything I have presented on facts and confirmable evidence .
Let us talk about the vanishing black boxes , vanishing airplanes and vanishing remains .
Also lots of the remains of these buildings have disappeared .
Even FEMA says that prevented it from carrying out a proper investigation .
We need to look at this evidence and ask ourselves what the war on terrorism really is .
I can see the ministers nodding in agreement but I would like to ask Prime Minister Fukuda .
Please look at me .
I have heard that when you were Chief Cabinet Minister at the time you felt many strange things about these attacks .
Do you not think it was strange ?
Prime Minister Fukuda : I never said I thought it was strange .
Mr. Fujita : Prime Minister what about the origin of the war on terror and the idea of whether it is right or wrong to participate in it ?
Is there really a reason to participate in this war on terror ?
Do we really need to participate ?
I would also like to ask about how to really stop terrorism .
Prime Minister Fukuda :
We believe based on evidence provided to us by the U.S. government that the attacks of 911 were carried out by Al Qaeda .
We need to put an end to Al Qaeda terrorism .
That is why international society is united in the fight against terrorism .
Here , concerning a law passed by the Democratic Party last year and based on UN resolution 16595 .
This is a resolution passed in response to the terrorist attacks on the U.S.
So you passed the law agreeing with the UN did n't you ?
Mr Fujita :
Did you confirm about the bodies and the facts behind the resolution because that is why you claim to be participating in this war on terrorism .
So I believe to end terrorism we need to pass a law that actually helps the people of Afghanistan .
I would like Mr. Inuzuka to talk about the law and about the fight against terrorism .
Tadashi Inuzuka : Among the many problems raised by MP Fujita the thing we need to worry most about is that the people in Afghanistan can live in peace and without worries .
That is the core of the issue of ending terrorism .
Without discussing this but just operating behind the back lines by supplying oil and not thinking about the entire situation or the people involved it is nonsense to debate this law .
This law should be made for peace and security in Afghanistan .
Our country needs to pass a real anti-terror law .

The best look to make yourself attractive
A study of hundreds of volunteers at Stirling and Aberdeen Universities found averting the eyes even a fraction can make you appear less attractive .
In the Royal Society 's Proceedings B journal , they say the direction of gaze plays a role alongside a symmetrical face or healthy skin .
An expert said it may stop people wasting energy on pointless courtships .
It suggests that how attractive you find someone is governed partly by how likely you are to be successful
Professor Ruth Mace
University College London
The study used pictures of male and female faces which had been subtly digitally manipulated .
In one picture , a woman might be looking straight at the camera , while in the next , a tiny adjustment meant she would be looking marginally to the left or right .
The difference was so small that it was not immediately obvious to the viewer .
However , after these pictures were shown to 460 men and women , who were asked to rate them for " attractiveness " , it became clear that it was having a pronounced subliminal effect .
In some pictures , there was an eight - fold difference in ratings between the " straight to camera " and averted gazes .
While many studies have found links between face shape , expression and other physical " cues " to attraction , this is one of the first to look in more detail at the direction of gaze .
The researchers wrote : " Mating effort is a finite resource that should be allocated judiciously , and preferences for direct gaze in opposite - sex faces would increase the likelihood of allocating mating effort to potential mates who are most likely to reciprocate . "
Success stakes
One of the paper 's authors , Dr Claire Conway , said : " People prefer faces that appear to ' like ' them , showing that attraction is not simply about physical beauty . "
Professor Ruth Mace , a researcher into evolutionary anthropology at University College London , said that while this seemed an obvious principle , it could be a sign of evolution at work .
She said : " It 's a pretty clear signal whether a person is interested in you or whether you are wasting your time .
" But it suggests that how attractive you find someone is governed partly by how likely you are to be successful . "

The Best VoIP Provider for You
One question that often pops up when choosing a provider is : “ What is the best VoIP provider ? ”
Unfortunately , there are too many factors to consider to simply pick one reigning provider .
What you can do is ask yourself the following questions to help narrow down your search :
In which country are you located ?
How will you use the VoIP provider 's service ?
How many users will have access to your phone system ?
How many phones / devices do you plan on connecting ?
How many international calls do you place every month ?
Do you have specific features you need to use ?
How much are you willing to pay ?
Choosing the Right Type of VoIP Service
There are four major types of VoIP service providers :
Choose the service that is appropriate for your calling needs .
Residential VoIP plans are cheaper than business VoIP plans because : ( 1 ) they have fewer features and ( 2 ) residential phones are used less frequently than business phones .
Do n’t use a residential VoIP service for a home - based business unless you ’re willing to pay overage fees or to have your VoIP service canceled .
VoIP providers are serious about enforcing their Fair Use guidelines .
Wholesale VoIP services are good if you need to run your own service provider , set up a calling card , or run a call center .
Note : most business VoIP providers can offer some kind of call center software .
Number of Users and Number of Phones
Know how many users / phones you will have on your VoIP phone system .
Most business VoIP providers charge per extension , so knowing how many extensions you will need is important for determining which VoIP provider offers you the best deal .
The number of phones is also important .
If you have phones in your conference room or your break room that are not used very often , you probably do n’t need those phones to be fully - featured extensions .
Features and International Calls
Each provider will disclose international calling rates on their website and a list of features on their website .
We give a standardized list for each provider ( with explanations on our VoIP Calling Features page ) but providers experiment with different features all the time .
Check their website ( using a link on their details page ) to verify how each feature works .
You can use our quote request form at the top of the page if you ’d like us to pair up with providers that best fit your needs .
Unfortunately , we do n’t generate quotes for residential VoIP providers at this time .
Still , whether you ’re looking for residential or business service , you can rest assured that you ’ll save hundreds to thousands of dollars a year once you ’ve switched to IP phone service .
Julia Sweeney , the former Saturday Night Live actress who now performs her one - woman show Letting Go of God , addressed the crowd at the Freedom From Religion Foundation convention in October .
Her remarks are hilarious .
She presents them around the theme of what she has learned since she started performing her show .
You can download the audio here ( MP3 ) .
The transcript below is courtesy of Freethought Today
It ’s lengthy , but well worth the read :
I want to just talk about the ten top things that I ’ve learned about people since I started performing my show , “ Letting Go of God . ”
I ’ve been engaged in so many conversations with people .
I get so many e-mails .
A lot of people , you know , hate me , and are worried about God and all eternity and everything .
But mostly I get fantastic letters from people who have gone through a similar experience .
First , I have to say Katha Pollitt is fantastic and I could have listened to her all night .
I was laughing when Katha was talking about these virginity rings .
What could be hotter for a teenager than sex while you ’re wearing a virginity ring ?
That is the worst idea in the world !
Omigod !
Did n’t they learn anything from the Catholic girls in uniforms ?
It ’s just so funny that they would think virginity rings would be a good idea and that it would keep teenagers from having sex .
I also think Katha ’s really on to something about being culturally isolated in America and how that turns people toward the church .
I think that is so potent , that idea , and so true .
But even my mother , who ’s a practicing Catholic , is coming around .
I ’ve noticed you get a big reaction when you say you ’re an atheist or that you do n’t believe in God–at least from your quasi-religious or going - along - with - it family and friends .
They hate you !
It ’s a big drama .
They suddenly get much more religious .
Now that it ’s been a few years , it ’s very interesting .
Boy , now they do n’t go to church every Sunday anymore .
I ’ve really watched that with my mother .
She told me about a friend of hers , whose daughter has two young kids , who had to move to some area in Washington state where she did n’t have any family and she has to work .
My mother was saying , of course all positively : “ And fortunately , there ’s this church that takes the kids after school .
They pick them up at school and take them to the church and they do homework with them and they feed them a snack and she can come pick them up at 5:15 .
Is n’t that so wonderful ? ”
Of course , I was horrified .
But as a mother , I understand .
Wow , how fantastic would that be if somebody picked your kid up and did homework with them and gave them snacks so that you could be at work ?
And yet it ’s so insidious .
Everybody thinks they ’re doing such a good thing .
I said to my mother , “ Oh , you know , that really bothers me .
Because I think while they ’re doing homework they ’re slipping in whatever religion this is . ”
And even she did n’t know how to react .
She said , “ Yeah , but you know , that ’s a good thing for her . ”
That ’s true , and I understand it , but I just think that is where we need to turn our attention in the future .
OK .
So here ’s the ten things that have really come to the forefront for me , talking to so many people about religion .
Number one : People want to be good .
People want to sacrifice for the common good .
This is just part of our heritage as human beings .
I believe we have evolved to have this feeling .
We all know how good it feels to help your neighbor do something or contribute , or make some self - sacrifice to do something .
Everybody wants that feeling .
This is where religion can sneak right in and hand this feeling over to people .
All this good will that we ’ve evolved to have can be just sucked up by an organization that is really doing things that are probably not for the greater common good .
Yet they can deliver that hit to people of feeling like they ’re doing something good .
For example , I just turned 48 (! ) and I ’m still friends with about eight girlfriends in Spokane I ’ve known since second grade , who are my age .
Six are practicing Catholics , one is at the Universal Church and one converted to Judaism .
But all of them do good things with their church , help build women ’s shelters .
They ’re all involved .
They all have that feeling .
When I talk to them about religion , they do n’t say , “ Oh , did I feel good yesterday thinking how Mary was a virgin and conceived Jesus ! ”
They do n’t say anything about Catholicism .
They talk about the community work that they ’ve done .
And that ’s what they connect with their church .
They assign that good feeling to their church .
I just observe that over and over again .
That wish to do good seems to be such a universal human trait and I think that religion does ill will with that .
Number two :
The second thing I ’ve noticed is a code of behavior is often necessary .
Katha kind of touched on this .
People need 12 - step programs .
They need structure .
I do n’t like the whole higher power of the 12 - step program .
But just today , I got a letter saying , “ I ’m a physicist , I ’m a scientist , I have 700 degrees and yet I know Jesus is the son of God because my life was a wreck and I could n’t get out of bed .
I accept Jesus as my personal savior and now I do these ten things and the proof is in the pudding .
. . . ”
As I say in my show , what William James said : “ It does n’t work because it ’s true , it ’s true because it works . ”
Number three :
The next thing I ’ve noticed is : People want to be in a club .
We evolved and here we are .
I ’m very glad about my club with you !
People need to be in a club .
We evolved in groups of small tribes .
They say that the average person has about 200 people in their address book because the tribes were around 200 people .
That ’s about how many people we can keep relationships straight with .
We like to feel affiliated .
Obviously , there was an evolutionary advantage to us to have this feeling .
I think religion , once again , in the absence of anything else , just swoops in .
In a way , in the last three years , even though I ’ve completely rejected religion and I ’ve done the show about how I rejected it , I ’ve seen what works about religion .
I ’ve seen the underbelly of the beast .
Because it does deliver .
It makes people feel good .
It gives them a code of behavior .
And they ’re in a club .
And it ’s easily identifiable .
I also agree with Katha that these things are changing .
I think it ’s an incredibly exciting time to be part of this group and all of these groups and people saying what they really think .
But I also think that religion delivers those basic needs for people who do n’t want to think too deeply about it .
I know , no big news to you , but for me , these are the things I ’m turning over in my head .
Four : People love to hate .
People feel closer to other people if they have a common person they do n’t like .
Come on , everybody knows that ’s true !
And it ’s true for us , too .
Religion delivers on that , too !
It gives people an instant common enemy , whether it ’s Islamic fundamentalists or secularists , that ’s immediately there and provided .
At Saturday Night Live , we were never closer than when Steven Seagal hosted –because we hated him so much !
That was when I actually found out where everyone who was on staff lived in the city .
I became close to everyone in our common hatred .
Religion provides that .
I understand talking about how much we do n’t like religious fundamentalists and they are so worthy of our hatred .
But I try not to get too much into that .
Because that ’s so easy .
That ’s really delivering easy hits .
Five :
The market does not like informed or skeptical citizens .
Advertisers and big companies that are short - term profit driven align themselves , consciously or unconsciously , with religion , because they both have common interests : keeping people needing things and not quite giving them what they need .
I really notice that over and over .
To me , one of the creepiest things is this alignment between big business and conservative religion .
Six : I feel that bashing religion is more popular than understanding it , or even standing firm about your point of view without bashing .
I think in the long term , understanding it is really the way to win .
Seven : Mostly , people are not introspective .
This has been a really profound realization for me .
I was raised in Catholicism .
I thought while everyone was praying they were thinking deeply about the hardest questions .
Turns out that ’s not true .
I do n’t think they are really thinking about anything .
I do n’t think –this is sad and maybe cynical–but I do n’t think most people are very interested in why they do the things they do , and why they believe the things they believe .
I know that makes me sort of a pessimist , but I came to this conclusion through thousands of e-mails and conversations .
Eight : Mostly people feel uncomfortable not knowing an answer .
Uncertainty is highly stressful .
It ’s undesirable .
And religion provides answers .
Science provides some answers , and those are often deeply unsettling and deeply humbling in a way that is very unnerving .
For example , to realize the universe does n’t care about you specifically is a very difficult thing .
When I think back to how I loved being a Catholic and I loved the nuns and the whole humility thing , I was kind of , “ Oh , that ’s so fantastic !
I ’m so humble , I ’m so humble ! ”
What could be more arrogant than thinking that there ’s a god out there wondering if you ’re performing the five offices of the day ?
That is arrogance taken to the extreme .
Nine :
We ’ve evolved our consciousness , I think , to have a great capacity to live in denial about things that make us feel uncomfortable .
I do this about a lot of things .
I think we all have to admit that we do this , just not about religion .
I stopped and looked at the uncomfortable answers with religion and I decided to go with the evidence .
But there is some adaptive advantage to being maybe ridiculously optimistic about things or not really knowing , just going on faith .
I think it ’s not good , but we have to admit that we all do live in denial to some degree .
And I have a tenth observation .
I even wrote this down .
This is bad –I should not end on this , I should end on something good !
I wrote : Life is meaningless .
That is not good ad copy .
What can I do about that ?
People say , “ But then life ’s meaningless ! ”
Then I go into my song and dance : “ But life is meaningful to me !
And I have my meaningful life .
Just being aware is so meaningful .
Blah blah blah . ”
And it ’s true .
I do feel that way .
But that is a bitter pill to swallow .
I do n’t think everyone can swallow that pill .
That maybe the universe is n’t so excited about these homo sapiens and has not been looking forward to our appearance all this time !
That ’s hard to admit .
Finally , I want to say three other things , and then I ’ll be done .
The biggest , the greatest harm that religion did for me is that it quelled my natural wonder about the world .
I did n’t really wonder about science .
When I took chemistry , first of all it was boring the way they presented it and all the guys just wanted to make stink bombs .
I did n’t think of it as being like cooking –I mean , I love to cook .
If they ’d presented it that way I would have been in .
But I felt that there was this answer to everything .
God gave us the 92 elements , or however many there are !
Everyone knows the real answer :
It ’s God !
I feel so cheated by that .
That ’s why I wish I could sue the Catholic church .
It ’s not for whatever those priests were doing , it ’s because I did n’t let my natural wondering continue , the thing that makes me the most human , the thing that makes me the most different from other species–my natural desire to know the answer .
It cut that off for me .
And I just think that is the most heinous thing that religion does .
I have a seven - year - old daughter .
We went to the Atheists Alliance convention and I was on this great parenting panel .
Everyone was talking about how they read a different myth from the world to their child every night .
And I was thinking , “ I can barely make dinner !
My god , I ’m so behind on the myths ! ”
So I have been trying to throw a myth in here and there .
I was telling my daughter recently about Adam and Eve .
I thought , OK , let ’s just start with the basic stuff .
So I was telling her , oh , there ’s this story , and it ’s about how the world began .
It ’s not how the world began , but it ’s a story .
There ’s Adam and Eve and then there was this tree of knowledge and God said , “ Do n’t eat from the tree of knowledge . ”
Then the snake came to Eve and Eve went to Adam and before you knew it everyone was having apple pie .
Then God came and was so mad about it and they had to leave the garden .
So Mulan goes , “ Well , how did God know they were eating the fruit ? ” I said , “ Oh , that ’s a good question !
I ca n’t remember . ”
So just today I looked it up .
Actually , it ’s very interesting because God comes in and says , “ Who was eating the fruit ? ”
Then Mulan said , “ But God knows everything and there ’re only two people . ”
I love her questions .
Then we got into the thing about the other animals .
Could they not eat the apple ?
Because we have an apple tree in our backyard and sometimes squirrels are eating them .
Could no animals eat it ?
Only the people could n’t eat it ?
So I read that chapter of Genesis again .
You know , I ’ve gone through my whole story .
I just knew vaguely what the Genesis story was .
Then I took a bible study class .
Then I was horrified by the bible .
Then I read comparative religion .
The story turns up here and there and everywhere .
You ca n’t turn around without seeing that story somewhere in the world .
But I just have n’t looked at it for a few years .
So today I read it again , and it is so beautiful .
That story is so obviously about enlightenment .
It is so obviously about human beings becoming aware that they ’re conscious and they are going to die and that they are naked and that they can do good and bad to each other .
Even when God says , “ From now on , Adam , you have to eat from the soil , from your crops , ” it ’s such a beautiful story about us learning how to till the land and farming .
How did that beautiful story get so fucked up !
It ’s such a great enlightenment story .
It ’s about saying goodbye to God .
It ’s about saying , “ I ’m eating the apple .
And now I take the consequences of eating the apple .
I know I ’m going to die .
And I know that I can do right and wrong .
And I know I have to cooperate and have pain in childbirth .
I ’m aware of it .
I ’m not an animal that is n’t aware of those things . ”
I was just arrested by the beauty of that .
So I just wanted to share that .
My last story is about my daughter .
I did n’t know what to do about the Santa Claus thing .
I start my show all about how I found out there was no Santa Claus , and how one thing just led to another .
So then I became a mother and I really felt uncomfortable about lying to my daughter .
I was very in conflict about how to handle Santa Claus because , of course , it ’s fun and fantastic and great .
I really do believe it ’s a secular celebration and it ’s part of our culture and I want to participate in that .
On the other hand , it involves all this lying , and I really want my daughter to know that I would not lie to her .
Maybe if the Nazis were coming and we were running away , under extreme circumstances I would lie , but not about Santa Claus .
I just did n’t want to do that !
I was very uncomfortable so I did n’t tell her about Santa Claus for a really long time .
Somehow she got to be three and a half without hearing about Santa , and then it was almost like she was too smart .
‘ Cause I was going , “ Well , there ’s this guy .
He ’s going to come over when we ’re asleep . ”
She ’s like , “ What ? ! ”
And I did not sell it .
I was so half - assed : “ Yes , he comes when we ’re sleeping . ”
She goes , “ Well , I ’m not going to sleep in my bed by myself when there ’s somebody coming in the house ! ”
Then I go , “ He leaves presents . ”
And she ’s like , “ Um , how does he get in ? ”
And I go , “ He comes down the chimney . ”
And she goes , “ WHAT ? ”
So we put out carrots for the reindeer and cookies .
And I went and ate them .
Omigod !
Then I went in her room and I say , “ Santa Claus was here . ”
She goes , “ I ’m not going out there ! ”
It was horrifying .
So now she ’s older .
Finally she started picking up on stuff , like the tooth fairy .
‘ Cause when we were in Iceland last year at the atheist conference she lost her tooth .
We did this big elaborate ritual of putting the Icelandic money under the pillow .
And then , I saved her tooth .
So eight months ago , I ’m in the living room and Mulan comes in with this little baggie that had her tooth in it and says , “ What is this ? ”
I ’m like , “ That ’s apparently a child ’s tooth . ”
And she goes , “ Uh - huh .
Are you the tooth fairy ? ”
I said , “ Yes , I am . ”
And she goes , “ And who is Santa Claus ? ! ”
So I said , “ OK . I ’m Santa Claus . ”
So it ’s out .
But then I go , “ But do n’t tell Coco , do n’t start telling kids at school . ”
I could see her little head working .
She goes , “ Well , all those letters I wrote to Santa Claus ?
So that was just writing them to you ! ”
And I go , “ Yeah , that ’s right . ”
She goes , “ Huh .
So I do n’t need to write a letter , I can just tell you what I want ? ”
And I said , “ That ’s right .
And I can just tell you what I want . ”
She goes , “ Oh . Well , what if I still want to believe in Santa Claus ? ”
And I go , “ Well , you can go ahead .
Yeah , you can believe in Santa Claus . ”
And she goes , “ Well , I think , yeah , I think there is a Santa Claus .
And I think if I ’m good I get an American Girl doll ! ”
So it was this whole hilarious thing .
We ’re going to Mexico City for Christmas this year .
My fiancee , Michael , and I are in the car and Mulan ’s in the back and she ’s asking all these questions about Mexico .
Now it ’s triply awkward , because it ’s already out , but now we ’re kind of half - pretending it ’s true .
She goes , “ So how does Santa Claus get to Mexico ? ”
And I go , “ He ’s magic ! ”
Then she goes , “ Ah , but does he come on Christmas Eve , or does he come on Christmas Day in Mexico ? ”
And I go , “ Mulan , as you know , I ’m Santa Claus , so , you know . . . whatever day you pick . ”
She goes , “ No , no !
I believe in Santa Claus ! ”
I go , “ OK . ”
She goes , “ So , what if they do n’t like have a chimney ? ”
Michael says , “ I think believing in Santa Claus is sort of like believing in God .
If you want to do it , that ’s fine .
Just do n’t ask too many questions . ”
Which I thought was the greatest answer .
やり始めればスムーズに仕事をこなすけれど、やろうとしても乗り気じゃない。とりあえず仕事しなくちゃいけないから、簡単にできる仕事からなんとなく始めてしまう。そして、気が重い仕事はどんどん先に伸びていく・・・。
つまらない作業にモチベーションをあげる
まず、仕事が完了するまでに行うすべての行動をリスト化する。このリスト化の作業は、作業全体の１割程度費やしても問題ないはずだ。それほどリスト化には効果が高い。次にリストができたら行動を行う時間を決める。午前中にはこれとこれ、と大まかに入れよう。みっちり入れないこと。仕事は何があるかわからないし、普通に仕事したら時間が半分余るような余裕を入れておく。
そして余った時間に、時間が決められていない緊急性の低い作業を埋めていく。
リスト化が終わったら、作業を開始する。終わった作業については終わった時間を記入し、線を引く。これが仕事に変化を与えることになり、目に見える変化になる。この変化がマンネリを防ぐ。
このリスト化を進めていけば、単純にやっていれば飽きそうなことでもモチベーションを高めて効率的に作業ができるはずだ。重い仕事というのは複雑だったり、量が多すぎたりするけれどそれを意識させないためにリスト化する。１つ１つの作業に分けて考えてみればなんてことはない作業。
フローのように仕事して、不安をなくして黙々とこなしていく。そうすれば重い仕事は気にならなくなる。予定を立てて、不必要なことを考えなくてもいいようにしよう。

I 'm guessing George Bush is going to be at least as pissed about this story getting out as he was pissed about the hospital confrontation story getting out .
They 're planning to spy on Americans , this is a big new deal , and they 're not actually telling us about it .
The former officials spoke on condition of anonymity to protect relationships with intelligence agencies .
[ my emphasis ]
A former senior NSA official said the difference between monitoring networks in order to defend them and monitoring them to collect intelligence is very small .
" If you 're going to do cybersecurity , you have to spy on Americans to secure Americans , " said a former government official familiar with NSA operations .
" It would be a very major step . "
Current and former intelligence officials , including several NSA veterans , warned that the agency 's venture into domestic computer and communications networks -- even if limited to protecting them -- could raise new privacy concerns .
Note the sources and level of classification and the implications of this move .
The plan calls for the NSA to work with the Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies to monitor such networks to prevent unauthorized intrusion , according to those with knowledge of what is known internally as the " Cyber Initiative . " [ my emphasis ]
In a major shift , the National Security Agency is drawing up plans for a new domestic assignment : helping protect government and private communications networks from cyberattacks and infiltration by terrorists and hackers , according to current and former intelligence officials .
That 's not exactly what this article says -- but it 's close .
The NSA - - our nation 's most effective spy agency -- is going to adopt major new duties in policing our public internets .
The article provides some details about the scope of the program .
The article mentions networks running our power grid , nuclear plants , and smart cards that run building and computer security .
Now to be fair , security of these networks is a real issue .
As the article points out , a serious hack attack could bring down the electrical grid .
As someone who remembers what it 's like for a whole region to lose power for just 3 days , it would be really devastating if it were more sustained or widely dispersed .
And as the article also points out , the Chinese can already hack at will , which means we 're pretty vulnerable for a country pretending to be an uncontested superpower .
I suspect one of the reasons for involving the NSA is to put the efforts to guard against hacking under the same power of obligation as we do spying .
Bush has already been through about 5 or 6 cybersecurity czars : Richard Clarke from 2001 to 2003 , Howard Schmidt for just three months after that , Rand Beers for a month , Amit Yoran from later in 2003 to 2004 , I 'm missing one from 2004 to 2005 , it went vacant for a year , then Greg Garcia for the last year .
One after another one quits because Bush wo n't force private companies to cooperate , which makes cybersecurity difficult if not pointless .
Yoran is quoted in this article as describing that as the problem with US cybersecurity .
Among the main challenges , he said , is that the Homeland Security Department has been given responsibility for the problem but lacks the authority and expertise to compel other agencies and the private sector to follow its lead .
The NSA has the expertise and the authority -- particularly with the amended FISA -- to compel communications companies to work with it .
And do n't forget that there 's that broad - ranging definition in the amended FISA of targets " relating " to foreign intelligence -- as cybersecurity could be understood to include .
Gorman gives one more hint about the direction of this program .
The new cybersecurity effort aims to build , in part , on an existing NSA program , code - named Turbulence , which has had a troubled start , the senior intelligence official said .
Turbulence is a program that has already caused headaches , both because of the creative funding used for it ( hiding it from Congressional oversight ) and its disorganization .
Dubbed ' Turbulence , ' the NSA 's ambitious effort is part bloodhound and part attack dog .
It attempts to continuously troll cyberspace to sniff out threats from terrorists and others , then rapidly tip off analysts who can mobilize defenses .
With the potential to be a powerful anti-terror weapon , it has become NSA Director Lt. Gen. Keith B. Alexander 's top priority .
With annual costs approaching $ 500 million , Turbulence is so secret that its existence has never been revealed publicly .
Inside the agency , Turbulence 's most sensitive activities are sequestered behind passwords known to few .
Turbulence also appears to be aptly named .
Delays , technical problems and what critics call a vague game plan have sparked rising skepticism inside the agency and in Congress .
Even Alexander has been growing increasingly impatient , former NSA officials said .
Early tests of the Turbulence technology ' are not going very well , ' said a former top NSA official who maintains contact with agency colleagues .
' They have had trouble with the delivery . '
Meanwhile , lawmakers have been angered by the NSA 's method of funding Turbulence , which more than a year into its existence does not appear anywhere in the agency 's budget , according to current and former officials .
The NSA , they said , has funneled money from older , largely defunct programs into new ones that are part of Turbulence while breaking up the initiative into smaller programs - limiting Congress ' oversight .
With Democrats in control of Congress , Turbulence is expected to come under greater scrutiny .
[ snip ]
Turbulence includes nine core programs , with intriguing names such as Turmoil , Tutelage and Traffic Thief .
Among their goals : mapping social networks based on intercepted communications , embedding technology on networks to collect data , and searching for patterns across hundreds of NSA databases .
Put two and two together , and it appears that this is an effort to use the NSA 's ability to compel cooperation to apply it to the search for domestic hacking , using social networks and databases .
I can see why that would raise privacy concerns .
Using the name " Josh Evans " , the trio were said to have duped Megan into believing that " Josh " had the hots for her .
However , the flirting soon turned into abuse and " Josh " incited a barrage of hate posts from other users that drove Megan to take her own life .
The Meiers were not aware that " Josh " was fictitious or that their neighbour knew about the deceit until six weeks after their daughter 's death last October .
St. Charles County prosecutor , Jack Banas , has asked the county 's police department to find out who is behind the site , which has the offensive title of Megan Had It Coming .
The Drew family have not commented publicly , but Drew 's attorney , Jim Briscoe , denied that his client had any involvement .
" I can categorically say that she did not write it , " Briscoe told foxnews.com .
The author of the 3000 - word post says the blog is an attempt to tell the other side of the tragic story that has ruined the lives of two families and turned an unwelcomed spotlight on a once quiet middle American neighbourhood .
Megan Had
It Coming includes the assertion that Megan was a " total psycho and everyone knew it " , that she was a " total bitch to everyone around " and that " she had it coming with all the shit she did " .
The I'm Lori Drew post asserts that it was Megan who first " coordinated a MySpace attack on my daughter " using friends ' accounts because her parents had banned her from the social networking site for making a fake profile that she used to " bully a classmate " .
On Monday , Banas , after re-investigating the case , found that there were no grounds to charge Drew , her daughter or Drew 's 18 - year - old employee who has been named as Ashley Grills .
He also said that contrary to earlier police reports , Lori Drew - who was 48 at the time - did not instigate the Josh Evans profile , nor did she use the fake profile to communicate with Megan .
While she knew about the ruse , she was apparently unaware that the girls had used the Josh profile to attack her neighbour 's daughter .
" Our daughter died , committed suicide , and she still did n't say a word , " Megan 's mother Tina Meier said after the announcement that there would be no prosecution .
" I still feel what she did is absolutely criminal . "
And that mitigating statement appears to have done nothing to quell the angry mob - most of it based in cyberspace - that has been going after Lori Drew and her family ever since the story broke in local newspaper last month .
Sarah Wells , the blogger who first outed Lori Drew as the neighbour involved in the MySpace hoax , is unrepentant , despite the new claims .
" I do n't regret naming Drew , " she said in an email response to a series of questions .
Despite the collateral damage that Drew 's daughter would suffer as a result of her mother 's public humiliation , Wells also said she did not think it would set a good example if Lori Drew 's actions were " accepted " .
" I think it is probably a good thing for [ the daughter 's ] development to see her mother pay the price of public scorn for her actions , if no other price ... to know that society is disgusted by such acts , " she wrote in her email .
As the story gain more attention , internet avengers took matters into their own hands .
They plastered photos of the Drews and Ashley , their addresses , phone numbers and email details over the internet including on sites like People You 'll See in Hell and Rotten Neighbors .
Local businesses that advertised in Lori Drew 's coupon book business have also been harangued and targetted with boycott threats .
" It 's fair for people to say to Drew 's clients , ' sever your ties to her or we wo n't want to do business with you as long as you are associated with her ' , " Wells said .
The Drew 's lawyer , Jim Briscoe , told the the NBC's Today show on Tuesday that the bad publicity has forced his client to close her business and caused her daughter to drop out of school .
A series of physical attacks on the Drew house - including a brick throwing incident and a paint gun attack - has cast doubt on whether the family could continue to live in the community , Briscoe said .
The suburban street where the families live , Waterford Crystal Drive , has been transformed into a real life version of Wisteria Lane , the fictional street in the TV series Desperate Housewives , with neighbours taking sides , the nation 's press trawling the neighbourhood for leads and an increased police presence following the attacks .
There is an amazing new technology that promises much cheaper solar energy and it ’s not hedged on future technology or unresolved production issues .
The technology is Inflatable Solar Concentration , it exists today and is being developed by a company called Cool Earth and the name is fitting because this technology is nothing short of cool .
The concept of Inflatable Solar is born out of the need to save the planet from energy conflict and environmental damage and Nobel prize winning scientists from around the World are gathered t o make it happen .
The goal is to reduce the cost of Solar by an incredible 25 x in 3 years from $ 5.00 per watt to about 20¢ , and they ’re well on their way to doing so .
Inflatable Solar works by concentrating light and focusing it onto photovoltaic cells , increasing the energy impacting the cells many times over .
The design costs ( 400 x less ) per collected area than conventional mirrors and yet is so stable that it can withstand 130 mile an hour winds .
The 2 meter wide bubble design also has the advantage of protecting the delicate mirror surfaces from rain , insects and dirt .
Each in a series of concentrators are suspended on support cables that also control movement of the collectors .
A grid of poles suspend the system high in the air making for usable land under the grid for farming ranching or other purposes .
The idea is thought to have greater potential than wind energy which is limited by its material cost and relative smaller area of possible installation .
Bush associates still consolidating their hold on US media Diane Sweet
Published : Wednesday December 26 , 2007

Print This Email This Longtime associates of President George W. Bush are consolidating their hold on American media with a string of recent acquisitions .
Conservative media mogul Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp. earlier this month announced the sale of 8 of its US television stations to a private equity firm -- Oak Hill Partners -- for an estimated $ 1.1 billion dollars that is expected to close sometime in 2008 .
The deal leaves Murdoch with another 27 television stations in major US cities such as Boston , New York City , and Los Angeles , as well as The New York Post , a controlling interest in British Sky Broadcasting , movie studio 20th Century Fox , and Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones & Co Inc. Oak Hill Partners lead investor Robert M. Bass , a longtime associate of President Bush , is also the founder of the Ft. Worth , Texas - based Bass Brothers Enterprises .
Oak Hill issued a statement announcing the stations would be jointly managed by a broadcast holding company , Local TV , that was created by Oak Hill for the purpose of purchasing 9 other television stations from The New York Times previously this year .
Conservative ties for the Bass Brothers Robert Bass , along with his brothers Lee , Ed , and Sid , from a wealthy Texas oil family , all attended Yale University where Ed was a classmate and friend of George W. Bush .
The Bass family , through various political action committees , were heavy - hitting contributors to Bush 's gubernatorial campaigns in Texas , according to the student watchdog group University of Texas Watch .
Robert Bass is also the founder and chairman of Aerion Corporation , which has been the recipient of several very lucrative DARPA contracts for the development of supersonic laminar flow wing studies , along with research and test flights .
News Corp. had originally intended to sell off nine of its US television stations ; however Bass 's subsidiary , Local TV , could not purchase WHBQ - TV in Memphis , Tennessee as it had previously purchased CBS affiliate WREG - TV : " Federal Communications Commission rules allow market duopolies but only one of the two stations under a single owner can be among the market 's four top - rated stations there and there must be least eight unique station owners in the market once the duopoly is formed . "
Local TV , LLC From Local TV , LLC 's homepage : " The company will immediately focus on back office and administrative functions , " adds Lawrence .
" Then we will move to creating specialized knowledge teams for TV assets , addressing market - specific challenges and opportunities with special swat teams , developing vertical and homegrown content , and finding new ways to deploy capital .
And that is just the beginning . "
The site also lists among its holdings in a statement issued online prior to the News Corps purchase , 23 large and mid-size stations , as well as the nine small to mid-sized stations purchased from The New York Times .
A Who's Who of America 's top scientists are launching a quixotic last - minute effort this week to force presidential candidates to detail the role science would play in their administrations – a question they say is key to the future of the country , if not the world .
" Right now we have a confluence of issues facing candidates : embryonic stem cell research , global warming , science and technology education , biotechnology and energy policy – it's just becoming an avalanche , " says Lawrence Krauss , a physics professor at Case Western University , and author of the bestselling The Physics of Star Trek .
" I think at some level , you have to get some insight into what the candidates know , or what they 're willing to learn . "
Behind the call is a growing fear that the United States is falling behind in science and technology education , and that a leader who is scientifically illiterate wo n't be able to keep the United States ahead in the global economy .
The candidates did not respond immediately , but most of the Democratic contenders for the White House have released science policies .
And Sen. Hillary Clinton has repeatedly slammed the Bush administration 's science record .
Republican candidates can be forgiven for not immediately responding to the call for a dialog on science .
Iowa front - runners Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee were busy sparring this week over whether Romney believes Satan and Jesus Christ are brothers – a relatively obscure doctrine of Romney 's Mormon faith .
In a May televised debate , three of the Republican candidates – Huckabee , Tom Tancredo and Sam Brownback ( who has since dropped from the race ) – indicated that they do n't believe in evolution .
Against this backdrop , the push for a science debate might look like a partisan dig at a devolving GOP , a perception bolstered by the list of signatories .
These include Chris Mooney , author of The Republican War on Science , and attorneys Eric Rothschild and Stephen G. Harvey , the two lawyers who won a 2005 landmark legal challenge of a Pennsylvania school district board 's decision to teach " intelligent design " as an alternative theory to evolution .
But also on board are 11 Nobel laureates in science , the editor of Scientific American , the president of Princeton University , Bill Nye the Science Guy , and other academic luminaries in the field .
Krauss calls the drive bi-bipartisan , noting the inclusion of Norm Augustine , the retired CEO of Lockheed Martin , and Richard Garwin , who was on the White House 's Science Advisory Committee under both Democratic and Republican administrations .
Minnesota Republican congressman Jim Ramstad is also on the list .
That so many scientists are involved is a sign of the times , says Al Teich , the American Association for the Advancement of Science 's director of policy .
" I think scientists are more political now than they have been in a long time , " says Teich .
" I think it 's mostly as a result , not of neglect , but of having many aspects of science ignored in the current administration 's statements and policies , and the editing of scientific reports by junior officials in the White House . "
Recent polls show that much of America still believes in creationism .
But they also show that the majority of voters do n't care whether a candidate believes in evolution or not .
A June USA Today Gallup Poll found that 54 percent of Americans surveyed said that it would make no difference to them if a presidential candidate said that they do n't believe in the theory of evolution .
And 70 percent of those surveyed said that a candidate 's view on evolution was n't relevant .
But that 's precisely the point , notes Krauss .
A candidate 's position should matter because it undergirds so much of the science - driving policy ; bad science leads to bad decisions .
He equates not believing in evolution to not believing in the laws of gravity .
" What we need to do is raise the public discourse so that ( not believing in evolution ) is not an acceptable statement , " he says .
HARDLY a week goes by without a new reason to be gloomy about the dollar .
The latest scare is that members of the oil - rich Gulf Co-operation Council ( GCC ) might loosen their links to the greenback , depriving the foreign - exchange markets of a reliable buyer of the troubled currency .
The United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) , through its central bank governor , recently hinted that it would like to free itself from the dollar peg , but would prefer to do it in concert with the other GCC members — Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , Qatar , Oman and Bahrain .
Last May Kuwait broke ranks and decided to track a basket of currencies .
Since then , the Kuwaiti dinar has risen by nearly 5 % against the dollar .
Now others might follow Kuwait 's lead .
Someone close to the GCC says that some members are advocating a substantial revaluation — perhaps by as much as 20 - 30 % — if the dollar 's slide continues .
Another option being talked about would be to link the Gulf currencies to euros as well as dollars , with up to half the basket in the European currency .
Further discussions will take place at a council summit on December 3rd and 4th .
Futures markets are already pricing in a slight loosening of the dollar peg — though the UAE 's central bank sought to quell speculation on November 22nd by cutting short - term interest rates .
The immediate problem for the Gulf states is that the inflationary effects of the oil - price boom are being amplified by their yoke to a weakening currency .
Inflation , which until 2003 was rarely above 3 % in the Gulf , is now around double - digit rates in Qatar and the UAE ( see chart ) .
Even in Saudi Arabia , where inflation has been more muted , it picked up to nearly 5 % in September .
Much of the pressure is from rising world food prices , which are a bulky item in consumer - price indices .
A revaluation would help cap inflation by making imported food cheaper .
But housing costs are the biggest contributor to inflation in the UAE and Qatar , say Gerard Lyons and Marios Maratheftis , economists at Standard Chartered Bank .
Spurred by strong oil revenues , these two economies have been growing at an annual rate of 8 - 10 % , drawing in more workers from overseas and pushing up rents .
The rigidity of the exchange - rate regime gets in the way of policies that might temper these forces .
Countries with pegs to the dollar have to mimic the policy of the Federal Reserve .
If a GCC state tried to tighten its monetary policy when , as now , the Fed is easing , it would push its currency above the dollar peg .
The trouble is , a policy setting that is right for recession - threatened America is wrong for the GCC , especially at a time when oil prices are reaching record highs , as they briefly did on November 21st , of $ 99.29 a barrel .
The pressures are made worse by speculative deposits , in anticipation of a revaluation , that drive down interest rates and add more fuel to the boom .
The broad - money supply grew last year at an annual rate of 15 - 40 % in GCC countries , according to Standard Chartered .
If , as seems likely , some GCC members let go of their existing dollar pegs , what might they put in their place ?
The simplest gambit would be a one - off revaluation : keep the link with the dollar but at a higher exchange rate .
That would cap import prices and soak up the speculative hot money that has added to liquidity .
It should also take the steam out of asset markets — and perhaps housing costs — by making investments more expensive for foreigners , including imported workers .
Yet a revaluation would not address the problem of policy inflexibility ; the GCC would still be yoked to the Fed .
A bolder course would be to follow Kuwait 's lead and peg to a basket of currencies .
Mr Lyons reckons that the dollar accounts for around 70 % of the Kuwaiti basket , the rest made up of the euro and other currencies .
Fuzziness about the precise make - up of the currency weighting allows Kuwait some discretion on interest rates — a “ great benefit , ” says Mr Lyons .
But even this is not ideal .
Benchmarking to any rich - world interest rate is unlikely to suit the Gulf , since high crude prices depress income for oil importers but boost it for oil exporters .
Brad Setser of the Council on Foreign Relations suggests one way around this problem is to have oil as one of the prices targeted in the basket .
A revaluation has costs .
The huge stock of dollar assets held in the GCC would be worth less in terms of the home currencies .
But unchecked inflation would also erode the domestic value of foreign assets and in a more damaging way .
A shift towards a looser peg in the GCC would undoubtedly hurt the greenback .
At the very least , dollars would be purchased at a slower rate — leading to what Mr Lyons calls “ passive diversification ” .
At worst , the policy might encourage others to follow , sparking panic sales of American assets .
That is the main reason why Saudi Arabia is reluctant to move now , when dollar sentiment is so precarious .
But given the inflation problem elsewhere in the GCC , the odds are that one or two more members will follow Kuwait .
It 's fairly easy to have a good , consistent morality without belief in a supreme being supreme beings and an objective morality .
All it takes is empathy - the ability to understand that others have feelings and thoughts like you do , and that they should be treated by you the same way you 'd want them to treat you .
That there 's no difference between whether it 's you hurting them or them hurting you .
Then just a little nudge more by the realization that not everyone likes and dislikes the exact same things .
At that point , it 's very easy to treat others with fairness and respect .
A morality based on that is a very good one .
It wo n't cover all issues , but then again , there is n't an existing one that does .
If you are only following a morality because of the threat of punishment , whether here or in a theoretical afterlife , then you are n't a moral person .
True morality is not killing because it's not right , and not just because of fear of jail or hell .
On May 22 , 1955 , Ronald Mallett 's father , a 33 - year - old TV repairman from the Bronx , died of a sudden heart attack .
Mallett ( pronounced M'lette ) was 10 years old and the trauma of the event , not unnaturally , knocked him for six .
A year later , he read H.G. Wells 's classic novel The Time Machine , which gave him the idea to build a device that would allow him to return to 1955 and save his father 's life .
So far the story is fabulous , painful and babyish , the stuff of Hollywood - but fast - forward 47 years to June 2002 and the same Ronald Mallett , now professor of theoretical physics at the University of Connecticut , is delivering a paper in Washington to about 50 physicists at an International Association for Relativistic Dynamics conference , in which he explains how a machine involving a circuit of lasers could , in theory , send a particle backwards in time .
It has long been known that Einstein 's relativity allows for certain forms of theoretical time travel .
If you whizz off into outer space at the speed of light , you will find upon your return that time passed much quicker for those on Earth than it did for you in your rocket .
The unsolved practical problem is how to get a human body to move at such a speed .
Einstein tells us this can not be done .

Early in the morning of April 9 , 1948 , commandos of the Irgun ( headed by Menachem Begin ) and the Stern Gang attacked Deir Yassin , a village with about 750 Palestinian residents .
The village lay outside of the area to be assigned by the United Nations to the Jewish State ; it had a peaceful reputation .
But it was located on high ground in the corridor between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem .
Deir Yassin was slated for occupation under Plan Dalet and the mainstream Jewish defense force , the Haganah , authorized the irregular terrorist forces of the Irgun and the Stern Gang to perform the takeover .

Some of the world 's best - known atheists , including British scientist Richard Dawkins , appear in the documentary , but they are unhappy with it .
They say they agreed to appear in a documentary called Crossroads , but have ended up instead in Expelled : No Intelligence Allowed .
They had expected Crossroads to be a debate about creationism versus Darwinism , but Expelled supports intelligent design ( ID ) , a variation on creationism .
The premise of Expelled is that scientists sympathetic to intelligent design are penalised by being denied academic posts .
The film , to have its premiere on February 12 in cinemas across the US , is fronted by Ben Stein , an actor and New York Times columnist .
The timing may be linked to the 2008 presidential election , where creationism versus Darwinism often features in candidates ' debates .
Professor Dawkins , who is speaking at the Atheist Alliance convention in Crystal City , Virginia , said in an email that had he known the film 's premise he would not have agreed to take part .
" At no time was I given the slightest clue that these people were a creationist front , " he said .
Other atheists said they were uneasy about the way they felt they had been duped .
Paul Zachary " PZ " Myers , a biology professor at the University of Minnesota and a leading critic of creationism , reproduced on Prof Dawkins ' website a letter from Mark Mathis , a producer for Rampant Films .
It says : " We are in production of the documentary film Crossroads : The Intersection of Science and Religion ... we are interested in asking you questions about the disconnect / controversy that exists in America between evolution , creationism and the intelligent design movement . "
Professor Myers agreed to do the interview , but was surprised to see his name appear instead in what he described as " this new ID creationist movie " - Expelled .
Stein denied in the New York Times that he had misled anyone .
" I do n't remember a single person asking me what the movie was about , " he said .
The film company said the movie 's title was changed on the advice of marketing experts .

In the early 20th century , there was a sharp increase in the number of people openly seeking to have one or more of their healthy limbs surgically removed from their bodies .
It ’s not a dramatic new weight loss program , but rather a disorder where a person is tormented by the overwhelming desire to have one or more of their limbs amputated .
It is known as Body Integrity Identity Disorder ( BIID ) or Amputee Identity Disorder , and it involves an urge so powerful that it leads many sufferers to damage the offending limbs beyond repair in order to bring about amputation .
Individuals who have this bizarre condition typically refer to themselves as “ amputee wannabes . ”
Sufferers of BIID often complain that they do not feel “ whole ” while in possession of the limbs in question .
An amputee wannabe has a very fixed idea of which limb is unwanted , and what level of amputation will make them a “ whole ” person .
The most commonly expressed desire is to have a leg removed above the knee , but sometimes the person is looking to rid themselves of an arm , a leg below the knee , or sometimes multiple limbs .
The disorder usually includes feelings of intense jealousy at the sight of an amputee .
An individual stricken with BIID will commonly “ rehearse ” the amputated state in private and in public by pretending that the limb is not present , sometimes binding the arm or leg so it can not be easily moved .
Some even design and fabricate prostheses to allow themselves to appear to have the amputation they desire .
Since there are very few surgeons willing to separate a person from his or her healthy limbs , some sufferers of Body Integrity Identity Disorder go so far as to destroy the limbs in question so that amputation becomes the only option .
There are reports of individuals freezing the unwanted arm or leg with dry ice , or creating a wound and deliberately infecting it .
Some have used even more extreme measures , such as shooting one ’s own leg with a shotgun , cutting off a limb with a chain saw or homemade guillotine , or allowing the limb to be run over by a train .
An ordinary person who must have a limb amputated due to injury or infection is typically emotionally devastated by the loss ; but astonishingly , individuals with BIID who successfully banish the unwelcome limbs describe feelings of “ completeness and enablement ” after amputation , and rarely express regret even after many months .
Some theorize that BIID is an extreme demonstration of Munchausen syndrome , a condition where the sufferer feigns or creates symptoms of illnesses in himself or herself in order to gain attention , sympathy , and comfort .
The role of “ patient ” is a familiar and comforting one , and it fills a psychological need in people with Munchausen’s .
BIID seems to have a similar pathology , where the subject seeks the special attention given to the disabled .
A number of people with this disorder also exhibit acrotomophilia , which is a strong sexual attraction to amputees .
Considering this , along with the strong jealousy towards amputees and the complaints of not feeling “ whole , ” it seems that sufferers of BIID do n’t want to lose a limb so much as they want to gain an amputation .
Most amputee wannabes describe feelings of shame and unworthiness , and a keen awareness that their ambition to abandon perfectly healthy limbs is bizarre .
People with this condition gain little help from psychiatric or psychological therapy , and any treatment merely helps to control the desire rather than to abolish it .
It is not a well understood disorder , and there is no known effective treatment aside from giving them the subject the amputation they desire .
A surgeon in Scotland named Robert Smith has amputated the legs of two otherwise healthy people who were suffering from BIID , but after some negative publicity the procedure was effectively banned by the National Health Service in the UK .
But if nearly all sufferers of Body Integrity Identity Disorder report feeling much happier and more “ complete ” after the removal of a limb , and there is no other effective treatment , is it necessarily a bad thing to allow them what they desire ?
An unfortunate coincidence has emerged from the New Hampshire primary results that is at least worth noting , if only for the sake of trivia ( or democracy ) : Hillary Clinton performed better , and Barack Obama worse , in counties where votes were counted using Diebold machines .
Whether you call it sour grapes or citizen journalism , the Brad Blog has the details .
We have absolutely no idea how someone might have pulled something like this off , and we certainly do n’t want to suggest that it is in the character of the candidate or her campaign to do so .
The point is , voting machine security is essential to our democratic process , and remains a problem that has not been resolved .
As long as these devices have serious vulnerabilities , doubt is possible , and a healthy democracy cannot function effectively in the shadows .
Update :
For the record , the Brad Blog has not endorsed and does not support any of the candidates , but is focused on making sure elections are fair and accurate .
Our apologies if we implied that the Brad Blog was upset over a Clinton victory .
As promised , in my long , and much - updated original piece from last night , first expressing concerns and asking questions about the NH results , folks today have been looking at the precinct numbers to compare the difference between those which “ counted ” ballots on Diebold op - scan systems ( for about 80 % of NH ’s voters ) , versus those that still hand - count ballots in the Granite State ( about 20 % of the votes ) .
Ben Moseley of The Contrarian , most succinctly covers what other folks have found as well today .
Namely , a 7 point overall bump for Clinton over Obama where the machines were used instead of hand - counts …
I just spent the last two hours putting together a spreadsheet of the Democratic results of the NH primary for each town with almost all but a few towns reporting , and the results were somewhat surprising .
… I say “ somewhat ” because some people will say this entirely foreseeable .
What the informal statistics show is that Hillary Clinton received a 4.5 % boost in towns using Diebold voting machines compared to towns that did n’t .
Meanwhile , Obama was hurt in these towns showing a 2.5 % decrease in the Diebold towns .
Moseley responsibly notes , however , that there could well be other reasons for Clinton ’s popularity in areas where Diebold ’s machines are used , in lieu of actually counting ballots .
For example , hand - counting in NH is generally done in the more rural areas and smaller precincts .
Perhaps Obama is more popular , or Clinton less , in such areas for any number of reasons .
The comparisons are only anecdotally useful for that reason .
However , had the hand - counted results matched up similarly to those in Diebold areas , it might well have been a sign that there was little to worry about .
( Even if I personally think not counting ballots is always something to worry about .
But that ’s just me , one of those whacky pro-Democracy fellers , I guess . )
Moseley a blogger and political science student from American University , writes about Clinton ’s Diebold bump : “ Does this show election fraud ?
Right now I ’m not sure , but the possibility definitely remains and must not be taken off the table . ”
Then , in two updates , he offers a coupla more eye - brow raisers …
Update : Some more statistics from the data shows that Obama in non-Diebold towns garnering 38.7 % of the vote to Clinton ’s 36.2 % .
The results in Diebold towns show the exact opposite : Clinton with 40.7 % of the vote and Obama with 36.2 % .
Not only are the positions swapped but the informal statistics have the second place candidate holding 36.2 % in both cases , which could easily be a pure coincidence .
What does n’t make a lot of sense to me right now and this could be a mathematical mistake on my part is where Clinton got the extra 2 % of votes in Diebold towns .
All the other numbers almost exact for every candidate , even Edwards who recieved 17 % of the vote in Diebold towns compared to 17.6 % in non-Diebold towns .
That still does n’t make up for the extra 2 % vote Clinton is receiving when she leads in certain towns compared to when Obama has the lead .
Update II : Another thing to keep in mind when looking at these statistics is that the Diebold machines create a 7 point difference ( +4.5 for Clinton , - 2.5 for Obama ) which is exactly what the polls had been predicting .
Again , I ’m not explicitly stating there has been fraud , but in a supposed democracy such as ours , skepticism is a virtue and necessity .

Pentagon draws ' Three - day blitz ' plan for Iran Adam Doster
Published : Saturday September 1 , 2007
Print This Email
This A national security expert revealed to The London Times that the Pentagon has " drawn up plans for massive airstrikes against 1,200 targets in Iran , designed to annihilate the Iranians military capability in three days . "
Speaking at a meeting organized by the conservative foreign policy journal The National Interest , Alexis Debat -- director of terrorism and national security at the Nixon Center -- said the U.S. military had concluded : " Whether you go for pinprick strikes or all - out military action , the reaction from the Iranians will be the same . "
It was , he added , a " very legitimate strategic calculus . "
According to the paper , one Washington source said the " temperature was rising " to launch an Iranian attack inside the Bush administration .
This information comes on the heels of reports from the International Atomic Energy Agency last week that cited " significant cooperation " with Iran over its nuclear program , including the slowing of uranium enrichment .
Israel , a close ally of the United States , has warned it will not allow Iran to acquire nuclear weapons , making its own preparations for airstrikes .
If the United States back downs , it is said to be " ready to attack . "
The entire article can be read HERE .
RAW STORY recently reported that European analysts had prepared a paper declaring the US had the capability for such a strike .
According to the analysis , the United States has the capacity for and may be prepared to launch without warning a massive assault on Iranian uranium enrichment facilities , as well as government buildings and infrastructure , using long - range bombers and missiles .
The paper , " Considering a war with Iran : A discussion paper on WMD in the Middle East "  written by well - respected British scholar and arms expert Dr. Dan Plesch , Director of the Centre for International Studies and Diplomacy of the School of Oriental and African Studies ( SOAS ) at the University of London , and Martin Butcher , a former Director of the British American Security Information Council ( BASIC ) and former adviser to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the European Parliament  was exclusively provided to RAW STORY late Friday under embargo .
" We wrote the report partly as we were surprised that this sort of quite elementary analysis had not been produced by the many well resourced Institutes in the United States , " wrote Plesch in an email to Raw Story on Tuesday .
Plesch and Butcher examine " what the military option might involve if it were picked up off the table and put into action " and conclude that based on open source analysis and their own assessments , the US has prepared its military for a " massive " attack against Iran , requiring little contingency planning and without a ground invasion .
That story , by Larisa Alexandrovna , is available here .
it is becoming more and more obvious that elements of the government carried out -- or at the very least -- aided and abetted the 9/11 attacks
doesn't
That 's
do
And for those who think that the majority of Americans who question 9/11 are crazy , psychoanalyze
!
Why do two - thirds of all Americans think it is possible that some federal officials had specific warnings of the 9/11 attacks , but took no action to prevent those attacks ?
The defenders of the official version of 9/11 argue that " the high percentage is a manifestation ... of an American public that increasingly distrusts the federal government . "
In other words , they argue that the approximately 200 million people who say that the emperor has no clothes have an illogical distrust of the emperor , and so they are seeing things .
They 've got the whole cause - and - effect backwards .
In fact , the American public increasingly distrusts the federal government because .
Despite the say - nothing media , the American public is getting the fact that the government 's story about 9/11 just does n't add up and that the vast majority of people in every relevant field who have examined 9/11 say so .
The reason two - thirds of the American public believe the emperor has no clothes is because he .
. . and yet he and his cabinet are demanding that we compliment him on his clothes .
why we distrust him .
Whatwe trust ?
Our eyes and our brains .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Top Bush administration officials are shifting into damage - control mode after a House committee narrowly approved a resolution that labels the killings of Armenians in Turkey during World War I as " genocide . "
The House Foreign Affairs Committee passed the measure 27 - 21 Wednesday evening , even though President Bush and key figures lobbied hard against it .
The Web site of Turkish President Abdullah Gul carried a statement calling the decision " unacceptable , " saying it " does n't fit a major power like the United States . "
State Department spokesman Sean McCormack issued a statement expressing " regret " for the committee 's action , warning the resolution " may do grave harm to U.S. - Turkish relations and to U.S. interests in Europe and the Middle East . "
The nonbinding House resolution says the deportation of nearly 2 million Armenians from the Ottoman Empire between 1915 and 1923 , resulting in the deaths of 1.5 million of them , amounted to " genocide . "
Turks strongly reject the genocide label , insisting there was no organized campaign against the Armenians and that many Turks also died in the chaos and violence of the period .
Turkish officials had warned approval of the resolution could jeopardize U.S. relations with their country , a NATO member that has been a key U.S. ally in the Middle East and a conduit for sending supplies into Iraq .
Undersecretary of State Nick Burns said Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice would call the Turkish leadership Thursday to express " deep disappointment " with the vote .
Watch why Rice and Gates oppose the resolution »
" We want to convey to the Turkish people and the Turkish government a message of respect and a message of support for them and the hope we can continue to work together with them , " Burns said .
The president , Rice and Defense Secretary Robert Gates all warned against passing the resolution .
" We all deeply regret the tragic suffering of the Armenian people that began in 1915 .
This resolution is not the right response to those historic mass killings , " Bush said at the White House .
Rice and Gates said Gen. David Petraeus , the top U.S. military officer in Iraq ; U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker ; and Adm. William Fallon , head of the U.S. Central Command , also raised concerns about the resolution .
Gates said good relations with Turkey are vital because 70 percent of the air cargo intended for U.S. forces in Iraq and 30 percent of the fuel consumed by those forces flies through Turkey .
U.S. commanders , Gates said , " believe clearly that access to airfields and roads and so on in Turkey would very much be put at risk if this resolution passes and the Turks react as strongly as we believe they will . "
Nabi Sensoy , Turkey 's ambassador to the United States , said the resolution 's passage would be a " very injurious move to the psyche of the Turkish people . "
He predicted a " backlash " in the country , saying there would be setbacks on several fronts : Turkish - American relations , Turkish - Armenian relations and the normalization of relations between the nations of Turkey and Armenia .
But House Democratic leaders said earlier if the Foreign Affairs Committee passed the resolution , they intended to bring it to the House floor .
The resolution 's sponsor , Rep. Adam Schiff , D - California , said the measure already had 226 co-sponsors , more than enough votes to pass " and the most support an Armenian genocide resolution has ever received . "
The resolution calls on the president " to ensure that the foreign policy of the United States reflects appropriate understanding and sensitivity concerning issues related to human rights , ethnic cleansing and genocide documented in the United States record relating to the Armenian genocide , and for other purposes . "
A similar resolution passed the committee by a 40 - 7 vote two years ago , but it never reached the full House floor .
House Republican leader John Boehner , noting the critical military and strategic alliance with Turkey , said bringing the resolution to the floor would be " totally irresponsible . "
" Let the historians decide what happened 90 years ago , " Boehner said in a written statement .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer met with Turkish officials in Pelosi 's office Wednesday morning .
Hoyer said he and Pelosi informed the officials that they support the resolution .
Hoyer said he told officials that while he considers Turkey a strong ally , " this was about another government at another time . "
" I believe that our government 's position is clear -- that genocide was perpetrated against the Armenian people approximately 90 years ago and during the course of the First World War .
And I believe that remembering that , noting that , is important so that we not paper over or allow the Ahmadinejads of the next decade or decades to deny a fact , " Hoyer said .
The term genocide is defined in dictionary.com as " the deliberate and systematic extermination of a national , racial , political , or cultural group . "
But the description is hotly disputed in Turkey , the predominantly Muslim , but modern and secular , pro-Western ally of the United States .
Turks argue that all peoples -- Armenians and Turks -- suffered during the warfare .
But Armenians maintain there was an organized genocide by the Ottoman Turkish authorities , and have been campaigning across the world for official recognition of the genocide .
The resolution arrives at a particularly sensitive juncture in U.S. - Turkish relations .
The United States has urged Turkey not to send its troops over the border into northern Iraq to fight Kurdish separatist rebels , who have launched some cross - border attacks against Turkish targets .
Observers of U.S. - Turkish relations have argued the House resolution could make Turkey less inclined to use restraint in dealing with its longstanding problems with the Kurdistan Workers Party .
" The United States has a compelling historical and moral reason to recognize the Armenian genocide , which cost a million and a half people their lives , " Schiff said .
" But we also have a powerful contemporary reason as well .
How can we take effective action against the genocide in Darfur if we lack the will to condemn genocide whenever and wherever it occurs ? "

Horses that wind up as No. 274 did last month here in Shipshewana , near the Michigan state line , may once have carried children on their backs , pulled wagons on a farm , even been to the races .
Now they are lame , aged , fractious or unwanted for any of various other reasons .
Some are young , never broken in to begin with .
The slaughterhouse closings themselves may have added to the population of the unwanted .
In some parts of the country , auctioneers say , the closings have contributed to a drop in the price of horses at the low end of the market , and the added distance in the shipping of horses bound for slaughter , combined with higher fuel costs , means that some small or thin horses are no longer worth the fuel it takes to transport them .
Add to that a rise in hay and grain prices , as well as a general economic slowdown .
“ First time in my life I ’ve seen livestock that has no value , ” said Devin Mullet , owner of Kalona Sales Barn in southeastern Iowa .
After his monthly auction in October , Mr. Mullet said , he shot 28 horses that had failed to fetch any bids .
Since then , he has monitored horses coming in for sale , turning away those he thinks are worthless  often yearlings and the aged , which tend to yield less meat .
( Horse meat for human consumption is shipped to countries including Belgium , France , Italy and Japan . )
But opponents of horse slaughter say its domestic demise is a victory , if an incomplete one , in their fight to protect animals they see as devoted companions .
The percentage of Americans favoring impeachment of President Bush and Vice President Cheney is approaching the percentage who favored impeachment of President Nixon in 1973 - 74 .
Public opinion has reached this high level even before Congress has started any impeachment investigation of the Bush - Cheney administration .
The public is way ahead of Congress , suggesting that it is time for the U.S. House of Representatives to move forward with the impeachment process .
In October 1973 , a Gallup Poll results showed only 28 percent favored Nixon 's impeachment and removal from office .
That was after a summer of well - publicized Senate Watergate Committee hearings .
Just nine months later , the day before Nixon resigned , nearly two - thirds of Americans believed there was enough evidence for an impeachment trial , and 55 percent thought Nixon should be removed from office .
That is how drastically opinion shifted once Congress acted and revealed the full extent of Nixon 's abuses of power .
Now , without any impeachment investigation by Congress , we already see the public 's desire for impeachment action approaching the level that led to Nixon 's departure from office .
Now , 55 percent of Americans believe that " President Bush has abused his powers as president , which rise to the level of impeachable offenses under the Constitution , " and 34 percent believe he should be removed from office .
For Vice President Cheney , 52 percent believe he committed impeachable offenses , and 43 percent believe he should be removed .
Perhaps most telling is that 64 percent of Americans believe that President Bush has abused his powers , and 70 percent believe that Cheney has done so .
Polling was conducted by American Research Group Inc. , on Nov. 9 - 12 .
Maine people feel much the same way .
According to a recent poll by Critical Insights Inc. , 40 percent of Maine adults say they favor " the U.S. House of Representatives beginning impeachment proceedings against Vice President Cheney , " and 38 percent against President Bush .
Not surprisingly , Maine Republicans and Democrats differ substantially on this matter .
Among Maine Democrats , 58 percent favor impeachment proceedings against Cheney , and 54 percent against Bush .

One in six Maine Republicans favors impeachment proceedings against Cheney , and one in eight against Bush .
Maine independents are about evenly split on the impeachment of both Bush and Cheney .
By any historic gauge , the nation clearly believes that we have a major problem with our president and vice president , although the Democrats in control of Congress have refused to even start an impeachment investigation .
They are dismissing the sizable portion of citizens calling for Congress to act as the Constitution directed to keep presidential power under control .
In Maine , as well as across the country , The Constitution grants Tom Allen , Mike Michaud and Congress the tool of impeachment to address the problem that a majority of Americans now recognize .
This impeachment tool is designed to keep our rulers ' power in check - to prevent drifting into a situation of absolute power by an individual or a small controlling group .
Impeachment is the tool being demanded by 43 percent of Americans who not only recognize the problem , but even call for the drastic action of removing Cheney from office .
House Democratic leadership is acting in a timid and irresponsibly political fashion .
Likely , they want to keep the Republican executives in power and all Republican politicians " on the ropes " until the 2008 elections .
Or perhaps they misguidedly believe that there are more important activities for Congress than heeding this historically strong demand to address these obvious abuses .
Whatever the motivation , Democratic congressional leaders continue to shirk their oaths of office by allowing the executive branch to ignore laws and plan expanded warfare without congressional authorization .
Public opinion and Constitutional responsibility are commanding congressional Democrats Tom Allen and Mike Michaud as strongly as in Nixon 's day .
Will they recognize the strength of public sentiment and the dire condition of our nation and take the required corrective action of impeachment investigation ?
Or will they choose to ignore the call and allow present and future presidents to control the people and their representatives - an authoritarian power that the Constitution directed Congress to prohibit ?

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Republican presidential candidate Fred Thompson on Tuesday urged more defense spending and a much larger military to shore up what he called major weaknesses in national security .

In a speech at the Citadel military college in the early primary voting state of South Carolina , Thompson planned to call for a significant boost in the size of the Army to 775,000 troops and the Marine Corps to 225,000 members .
He did not describe how he would pay for the increases in the prepared remarks .
The Pentagon already is expanding the Army to 547,000 by 2010 from 482,000 and the Marines to 202,000 from 175,000 .
“ We have major shortcomings in U.S. defense capabilities .
To confront these shortcomings , we must address several key priorities , ” Thompson said .
“ Too many commitments today leave our armed forces capable of meeting too few contingencies tomorrow ...
Half - measures and small increases will no longer do . ”
The U.S. military has had trouble recruiting in recent years , in part because of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
It now offers cash inducements and has relaxed academic requirements for new recruits .
Thompson is running second behind former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani for the Republican presidential nomination in most recent polls but has been widely criticized for running a lackluster campaign so far .
He won a welcome boost on Tuesday , gaining the endorsement of the National Right to Life Committee , a lobbying group that has led the fight against abortion rights .
That might boost him in Iowa which on January 3 holds the first binding vote in the state - by - state presidential nomination battles .
In his speech , Thompson also planned to call for boosting defense spending to 4.5 percent of U.S. gross domestic product , excluding the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
That would be up from about 4.1 percent of GDP now , which Thompson says includes money for Iraq and Afghanistan .
“ We must begin by rebuilding our military with the full recognition that national security comes at a price , ” he said .
President George W. Bush on Tuesday signed a $ 460 billion measure to fund the Pentagon for the 2008 fiscal year that began October 1 and Congress is weighing a separate $ 196 billion bill to fund the two wars .

No matter what industry it ’s in , labour conflict comes with a very high price tag .
Not just for the companies , and not just for the workers striking , but also for the economic lungs and peripheral jobs of the communities they ’re in .
The entertainment industry is not immune from that … as a matter of fact , it ’s probably more prone to this than most others .
According to the Hollywood Reporter , by the end of the month , the WGA strike will cost the Los Angeles economy roughly $ 80 million per day , and cost 33,000 jobs .
AND FOR SOME REASON THESE TWO SIDES HAVEN ’T SAT DOWN TOGETHER AT THE TABLE SINCE NOVEMBER 5TH !!!!!
I ’m not saying either one of these sides should have caved in … but to be costing the community $ 80 million per day , and effecting the jobs and livelihood of 33,000 OTHER people … you would at least think both sides would be sitting at the negotiating table TRYING to hammer out a deal instead of playing proverbial chicken !
The two sides have agreed to restart negotiations on November 26th .
A FULL 3 WEEKS after their last meeting .
3 weeks of not even talking .
3 weeks of other people having their livelihoods jeopardized .
3 weeks of the local economy getting hammered .
Good job guys … good job .
This is n't a Haskell tutorial , but it is a Haskell introduction .
I do n't want to try to teach Haskell , but I do want to break the ice and get you interested enough in Haskell so that you 'll explore the language more fully .
I 'm not going to go into detail on some of the most basic operations ( list construction and syntax for example ) you 'd expect to see in a tutorial .
You 're smart enough to work it out by example , but clearly a read of a proper Haskell tutorial will help before you get your hands too dirty .
I 'm going to assume that you already know how your way around Visual Studio and Windows™ .
All of the most important points are of interest to anybody thinking about learning Haskell , but if you 're using some other environment I can't help you do basic things like compile the program .
I was researching an article for kirit.com on “ zeugma ” and came across a Yoda quote on Wikipedia :
Fear leads to anger .
Anger leads to hate .
Hate leads to suffering .
This is an example of hypozeuxis which means the repetition of the same verb for several subjects .
It immediately struck me that this would be a perfect thing to try for my first foray into Haskell .
I also figured it would be interesting for people who had n't tried Haskell before .
So what we 're going to do is to start with a list like this :
[ " fear " , " anger " , " hate " , " suffering " ]
And end up with a string like this :
" Fear leads to anger .
Anger leads to hate .
Hate leads to suffering . "
In order to get there I 'm going to cover some of the more interesting and important points in functional programming .
I 'll show a little bit about how algorithms are created and written , how lists are manipulated and the basics of how pattern matching works .
I 'll also cover something called partial application ( closely related to currying ) and two of the most important functional algorithms , map and fold .
I 've chosen these topics as they 're the ones that are easy to start with , easy to understand given the problem that we 're working on and because they 're all fundamental building blocks of functional programming and functional idioms .
The first thing you 'll need of course is Visual Haskell which can be downloaded and installed via the Visual Haskell home page .
You need to download the one for your compiler , .NET Studio 2003 uses the 7.1 download and .NET Studio 2005 uses the 8.0 download .
Using Visual Haskell
Once you 've got it installed you should have a Haskell group to choose from when creating a new project to add to a Visual Studio solution .
We 're going to start off with a command line Haskell program .
Visual Haskell will make the project files you need and you will get a single file that contains a simple “ Hello World ” program .
Tip 1 — Visual Haskell gets really , really , really upset if you have spaces in any of the directories between the disk 's root and the Haskell project .
This is the code that we 've been given by Visual Haskell to start with :
module Main where main = do putStrLn " Hello , world ! "
Tip 2 — The Haskell compiler really , really , really upsets Windows .
It looks to me like the compiler is self modifying , so if it crashes it is because Windows has stepped in and stopped it .
You may need to log out and back in again if this happens in order to see the dialogue box asking you to make an exception for it , or you can find it via control panel ➜ system properties ➜ advanced ➜ performance ➜ settings ➜ data execution prevention ( phew ) .
The file you need to make an exception for is “ C: \Program Files \Visual Haskell\bin\ghc.exe ” .
Ignore everything except the string .
In Haskell the string that we see is really just syntactic sugar for a list of characters .
To start let 's change this code to the following ( I 'm going to rely on your intellect to be able to work out which bits we 're changing and which bits we 're leaving alone ) :
main = do putStrLn " fear leads to anger "
Tip 3 — There seems to be no simple way to run the program and actually see what it did .
The executable is tucked down in some sub - directory where it is hard to find , but if you want to see what output you get then find it you must .
You will have to run the program from the command prompt because the command prompt to see program output use .
So far so good , we have a great starting point .
Starting to code
Haskell has an operator which concatenates two lists ( i.e. adds one list to the end of another ) which is ++ .
We can break this first part of the problem down into splitting out the parts of the string that we need :
main = do putStrLn ( " fear " ++ " leads to " ++ " anger " )
You 'll immediately notice that as you edit the code you get little red wiggly lines wherever there is an error .
Frankly the errors do n't make sense to me , but if you started off editing to this :
main = do putStrLn " fear " ++ " leads to " ++ " anger "
You would have got a more or less incomprehensible error message which will appear as a tool - tip if you hover over the expression , and will be confirmed by the compiler if you try to compile the code .
I think that a little thought will convince you that it's a precedence problem , hence the extra brackets .
You can see this as well from the placement of the wiggly line .
It only sits under the putStrLn “ fear ” part of the code .
This gives a visual indication that the compiler sees this :
main = do ( putStrLn " fear " ) ++ " leads to " ++ " anger "
And that it does n't like what it sees .
Our first function
We now know how to make a simple expression so we should be able to turn this into a function , after all we 'll want to appply “ leads to ” to three different pairs of words .
We 'll call the function interstitial .
A function looks a bit like an assignment in other languages , but really it 's better to think of it like a mathematical formula :
interstitial left right = left ++ " leads to " ++ right
Writing a function does n't get much easier than that .
Tip 4 — Haskellers tend to use very short identifier names .
I 'm going to use longer ones as I think they look less cryptic .
As you get better at Haskell and more used to the syntax you 'll find yourself using shorter names .
Using the function is pretty obvious too :
main = do putStrLn ( interstitial " fear " " anger " )
Note that the brackets here are n't anything to do with surrounding the arguments to apply to the function like in most other languages .
The brackets are here just to ensure that the expression is handled in the right order .
Running this we get :
fear leads to anger
Not a bad start .
We 've played a bit with lists and seen that they can be combined and we 've also written our first function .
Lists and tuples
The next thing we 're going to do is to stop using putStrLn and to start to use print .
This is simply because that putStrLn will only write out a list of characters ( a string ) whereas print will print out any old thing to the best of its ability .
Try the change and you will get this as your output :
" fear leads to anger "
Back to our starting point :
[ " fear " , " anger " , " hate " , " suffering " ]
We can see that we 're going to have to do some duplication here , but what form are these duplicates going to take ?
So far we 've seen lists and , important as they are , they 're not the only useful way to structure data .
If we want to store the distances that I 've walked each time I 've got up and paced around whilst thinking about this introduction we might get something like this :
[ 2 , 3 , 3 , 3 , 3 , 4 , 10 , 3 ]
The fridge is three meters away .
The list stores an unspecified number of similar data points .
If I want to specify a location though I need an ordered collection .
I 'm writing this at ( 13.912205 , 100.582629 ) — click to see in Google Earth .
Co-ordinates like this are always given in the same order : latitude then longitude and there are always two of them .
This is called a tuple and of course the type of each datum does n't have to be the same and tuples can also nest .
If we include my height above sea level then the co-ordinate might look like this : ( 13.912205 , 100.582629 , ( 5 , metre ) ) .
Tuples are also very important in Haskell and they have a special syntax which is the same as the one we would normally use — they 're simply comma separated values between brackets .
Our basic sentence structure that we want to end up at ( if you factor out the “ leads to ” which interstitial will add for us ) looks a bit like this transformation :
[ " fear " , " anger " , " hate " , " suffering " ] [ ( " fear " , " anger " ) , ( " anger " , " hate " ) , ( " hate " , " suffering " ) ]
Each tuple represents a sentence and the tuples together represent the three sentences in Yoda 's hypozeuxisism .
The big question is “ can we write a function that gives us the latter from the former ? ”
A more complex function
We 'll call our new function inner_duplicate .
Before we can tackle that we need to know one other bit of syntax and think through properly what we have so far .
We 've already seen the list concatenation operator ++ .
This takes two lists and returns a single list , but we have to look carefully at our initial data .
[ " fear " , " anger " , " hate " , " suffering " ]
This is n't actually a list of characters .
Because each string is a list of characters this is actually a list of a list of characters .
We can see that there is a problem if we try this :
" fear " ++ [ " anger " , " hate " , " suffering " ]
The reason this does n't work is that we 're trying to append a list of characters to a list of list of characters and this does n't work .
If we want to do that we need another operator that carries out this specific thing .
That operator is the colon , : , ( often called cons ) and it takes an item and a list of items and returns a copy of the list with the new item at the front .
Try this :
main = do print ( " fear " : [ " anger " , " hate " , " suffering " ] )
We can also add more than one item at a time :
main = do print ( " fear " : " anger " : [ " hate " , " suffering " ] )
Although this does n't work :
main = do print ( " fear " : " anger " : " hate " : " suffering " )
Remember that the operator adds to the front of a list so it needs a list to operate on .
We can give it an empty list like this though :
main = do print ( " fear " : " anger " : " hate " : " suffering " : [ ] )
All of this is a rather round - about way of getting to pattern matching which is really a lot like what we 've done to make lists but in reverse .
Pattern matching — the opposite of list creation
What we want to do is to take the fist term with the second and then repeat this with the second and the rest of the list until we 're down to the last two when we just pair them up .
It 's easier than it sounds , but a diagram might help :
" fear " : " anger " : " hate " : " suffering " : [ ] ( " fear " , " anger " ) : " anger " : " hate " : " suffering " : [ ] ( " fear " , " anger " ) : ( " anger " , " hate " ) : " hate " : " suffering " : [ ] ( " fear " , " anger " ) : ( " anger " , " hate " ) : ( " hate " , " suffering " ) : [ ]
Replace the words with some symbols and you might describe the algorithm in this way :
inner_duplicate first : second : the_rest = ( first , second ) : ( inner_duplicate second : the_rest )
This handles all but the last step which can be expressed like this :
inner_duplicate first : second : [ ] = ( first , second ) : [ ]
Actually this is more or less exactly the way to write it in Haskell .
The only thing that we need to do is to add some brackets so that the pattern matching is done first :
inner_duplicate ( first : second : [ ] ) = [ ( first , second ) ] inner_duplicate ( first : second : the_rest ) = ( first , second ) : ( inner_duplicate ( second : the_rest ) )
If this looks like magic it 's only because it should .
Try it out :
inner_duplicate ( first : second : [ ] ) = [ ( first , second ) ] inner_duplicate ( first : second : the_rest ) = ( first , second ) : ( inner_duplicate ( second : the_rest ) ) main = do print ( inner_duplicate ( " fear " : " anger " : " hate " : " suffering " : [ ] ) )
[ ( " fear " , " anger " ) , ( " anger " , " hate " ) , ( " hate " , " suffering " ) ]
Interstitial injection
We need to quickly revisit our interstitial function because at the moment it does this :
interstitial “ fear ” “ anger ” ➜ “ fear leads to anger ”
And what we need now is this :
interstitial ( “ fear ” , “ anger ” ) ➜ “ fear leads to anger ”
When we look at it like this re-writing the function is surprisingly easy :
interstitial ( left , right ) = left ++ " leads to " ++ right
Now that we can take the tuples in our list how can we execute this ?
The obvious thing to do is to write a function that does it .
We have a list of binary tuples and we are going to get a list of strings instead .
Here 's one simple way :
do_interstitial [ ] = [ ] do_interstitial ( head : the_rest ) = interstitial head : do_interstitial the_rest main = do print ( do_interstitial ( inner_duplicate ( " fear " : " anger " : " hate " : " suffering " : [ ] ) ) )
Again we have a simple recursive function .
Empty lists are always just empty and for any other list we just apply our function to the head before carrying on with the rest .
I 've picked out the expression interstitial head in bold above because it's the only bit of the definition that actually uses the interstitial function itself .
The rest of it has exactly the same form no matter which function we want to apply to a list .
It is also a pretty common thing to do .
In fact its so common that it would be a real pain to have to do all of this typing every time we want to do something to each element in a list .
There has to be an easier way , and of course there is .
We can use map .
Enter the map
map is a very clever little function .
What you do is to give it a function and a list and it applies the function to each element in the list and returns us a new list with the results .
This explanation sounds very complicated , but the idea is actually quite simple as we can see by writing our version of it .
We 'll call ours do_function and we 'll just re-write our version of do_interstitial for it .
First off , the base case .
Remember we have to take a function as our first argument and the list as the next so we will get this :
do_function function [ ] = [ ]
Just the same except for the extra parameter we 're ignoring .
The next part looks just like the second line of do_interstitial except now we 're using the function that 's passed in ( and we have to pass it on in the recursive call ) .
do_function function ( head : the_rest ) = function head : do_function function the_rest
That does n't look too bad so far .
Here 's us calling it :
main = do print ( do_function interstitial ( inner_duplicate ( " fear " : " anger " : " hate " : " suffering " : [ ] ) ) )
I 've written the two arguments to do_function on separate lines otherwise we 're likely to get confused by all the brackets .
So if we think we understand how do_function works we should be able to replace it with the standard map function .
All we do is delete our version and use the normal one :
module Main where interstitial ( left , right ) = left ++ " leads to " ++ right inner_duplicate ( first : second : [ ] ) = [ ( first , second ) ] inner_duplicate ( first : second : the_rest ) = ( first , second ) : ( inner_duplicate ( second : the_rest ) ) main = do print ( map interstitial ( inner_duplicate ( " fear " : " anger " : " hate " : " suffering " : [ ] ) ) )
Yes , this is the entire program at this point !
And the output we get looks like this :
[ " fear leads to anger " , " anger leads to hate " , " hate leads to suffering " ]
Making Curry
This section actually contains a bit of terminology abuse , but it seems so common in Haskell that I 'm going to do it anyway .
What we are doing here is partial application rather than currying .
We are taking a function and applying an argument and getting back a function that takes the rest of the arguments .
Currying does n't take any values .
It just takes a function and returns a function .
The difference is in how the arguments are applied to the two functions in order to get the result out .
A binary function that was curried would be converted from a function that takes two arguments at the same time into a function that takes one argument and returns a function that takes one argument and returns the result .
In both cases two arguments are still needed , but before you curry the function you must supply them both together , but after currying you supply them one at a time getting back a function as an intermediate value .
It 's another of those things that 's simpler than it sounds .
In Haskell it is common to define all functions in curried form which I guess is one of the causes of the lax terminology .
The one thing that bothers me ( apart from that we have n't quite finished as we do n't have a single string yet ) is that the text “ leads to ” is buried in that interstitial function .
Would n't it be better to pull it out somehow ?
Haskell does provide a mechanism to do this and it is called Currying .
The technical definition of Currying is quite complex , but for our purposes we do n't need that .
Let 's start by pulling the string out anyway so we have this :
interstitial inner ( left , right ) = left ++ inner ++ right
The problem we have is how do we now get the string in there ?
The way we 're using map takes a function that does this :
interstitial ( “ fear ” , “ anger ” ) ➜ “ fear leads to anger ”
But now we 're doing this :
interstitial “ leads to ” ( “ fear ” , “ anger ” ) ➜ “ fear leads to anger ”
What we need to do is to wrap the interstitial up with the first argument to give us this sort of thing :
( interstitial “ leads to ” ) ( “ fear ” , “ anger ” ) ➜ “ fear leads to anger ”
This is actually exactly what partial application is .
We can apply any number of arguments to a function and we get back either an answer if we 've given it all of the arguments , or a function that takes the rest of them .
Again it 's harder to explain than to use :
main = do print ( map ( interstitial " leads to " ) ( inner_duplicate ( " fear " : " anger " : " hate " : " suffering " : [ ] ) ) )
All we do is to call interstitial with the first argument and then pass the function we get back to map which will repeatedly apply the function to the tuples in the list until we get all of our strings .
Hypozeuxis
The code that we 've got so far is certainly pretty cool , but we 've still got the actual program logic mixed up with the text we 're working with .
We should be able to separate them by writing a function that takes the “ leads to ” and the word list and applies the logic to it .
Here it is :
hypozeuxis verb words = map ( interstitial verb ) ( inner_duplicate words ) main = do print ( hypozeuxis " leads to " ( " fear " : " anger " : " hate " : " suffering " : [ ] ) )
It should now be clearer what the core of the logic is .
interstitial places a verb phrase between two other words .
places a verb phrase between two other words .
inner_duplicate duplicates the words in a list of words except for the first and last word .
It gives us back pairs of words .
duplicates the words in a list of words except for the first and last word .
It gives us back pairs of words .
map then runs interstitial on our list produced from inner_duplicate .
Finally hypozeuxis ties this logic up in a neat and easy to digest package .
It is n't quite finished though because we 're getting a list of sentences , not a single string representing the entire phrase and we 're also not getting capital letters at the start of the sentences .
Sentences and paragraphs
This is what we have now :
[ " fear leads to anger " , " anger leads to hate " , " hate leads to suffering " ]
Here is what we'd like to see :
“ Fear leads to anger .
Anger leads to hate .
Hate leads to suffering . ”
Hopefully we can see how to convert one of our strings into the right sentence form .
We just need to pull out the first letter , do a case conversion on it and then put a full stop at the end .
The one thing we do n't know how to do is the case conversion , but Haskell has a built in function , toUpper .
In order to use it though we have to pull in the right external module .
We do that by adding an import after the module Main where like this :
module Main where import Data .
Char
If you think about using the pattern matching we had earlier you can probably work out pretty quickly how to get our sentence function working :
sentence ( first : the_rest ) = ( ( toUpper first ) : the_rest ) ++ " . "
The pattern on the left separates out the first letter of the string and the expression on the right stitches it all back together again .
This sort of thing should be starting to feel familiar by now .
Personally I always feel like I have n't actually told Haskell what to do yet , but the program works anyway .
Paragraphs
The final basic building block that we need to learn about is folding .
Like map , fold is a basic functional idiom that abstracts a particular type of looping construct .
Whereas map is used to transform a list into a different list by applying a function to each element , a fold is used to transform a list into a value through the repeated application of a binary function .
The complication with fold is that there are all sorts of binary functions , some are left associative , some right .
There are also differences in how the result is “ primed ” , do we start with the values in the list , or do we start with a value we supply ?
This gives us four general folds that we can choose between :
foldl — Takes a function and initial value then applies the function to the previous results and each element in turn .
This is left associative .
— Takes a function and initial value then applies the function to the previous results and each element in turn .
This is left associative .
foldl1 — Takes a function and applies it to the first two elements in the list then successively applies the function to the result and each other value .
Also left associative .
If the list only has a single element then that element is returned and the function is not used .
— Takes a function and applies it to the first two elements in the list then successively applies the function to the result and each other value .
Also left associative .
If the list only has a single element then that element is returned and the function is not used .
foldr — Right associative version of foldl .
That is it starts with the last element in the list and moves backwards .
— Right associative version of .
That is it starts with the last element in the list and moves backwards .
foldr1 — Right associative version of foldl1 .
This means it starts with the last two values and moves backwards .
Before we can choose between these we should probably look at the function we 're going to use .
Here is a very simple function :
inner_space left right = left ++ " " ++ right
A bit of thought will tell us that this can be used either left or right associatively and give the same answer .
We also know that a paragraph of just one sentence is that sentence so either of foldl1 or foldr1 should work .
main = do print ( foldl1 inner_space ( map sentence ( hypozeuxis " leads to " [ " fear " , " anger " , " hate " , " suffering " ] ) ) )
If we run this we get the string we wanted .
Now what ?
Here is the complete listing that we have ended up with :
module Main where import Data .
Char inner_space left right = left ++ " " ++ right interstitial inner ( left , right ) = left ++ inner ++ right inner_duplicate ( first : second : [ ] ) = [ ( first , second ) ] inner_duplicate ( first : second : the_rest ) = ( first , second ) : ( inner_duplicate ( second : the_rest ) ) sentence ( first : the_rest ) = ( ( toUpper first ) : the_rest ) ++ " . " hypozeuxis verb words = foldl1 inner_space ( map sentence ( map ( interstitial verb ) ( inner_duplicate words ) ) ) main = do print ( hypozeuxis " leads to " [ " fear " , " anger " , " hate " , " suffering " ] )
A few things to notice :
There is no if statement or looping constructs .
There 's nothing that looks like standard program flow constructs at all .
More Haskell
The first most obvious thing is that much of the program can be re-worked to use more of the Haskell libraries and maybe a bit more advanced syntax .
Here are some ideas :
Use inner_space and a foldl1 to implement interstitial so that the spaces around the verb phrase are added for us .
and a to implement so that the spaces around the verb phrase are added for us .
The only difference between the two versions of interstitial we wrote is actually that one is curried and one is n't .
Can you work out how to convert between them ?
This is hard if you 've not come across currying before .
If you can do this then you should be able to work out how to unify inner_space and interstitial
Further learning
The first place to go from here is to look at Simon Peyton Jones ' A Taste of Haskell lectures from OSCON '07 .
There 's a part 1 and a part 2 and slides PDF .
There is a Haskell book in the process of being written at Wikibooks .
There you can also find links to YAHT — Yet Another Haskell Tutorial .
On Haskell.org is a much more complete list of books and teaching materials .
Finally , there is also a #haskell channel on Freenode .
People there are very helpful and answered my stupid questions very quickly .
It can be a bit like drinking from a fire hose .
Do n't expect to understand everything that you 're being told , especially at first …
Do n't be afraid to ask again if you did n't understand the answer the first time ( but say which bits you did n't understand ) .
Practical use
An obvious question now becomes “ What can I do with it ? ”
One thing that Haskell is very good for is prototyping , especially for prototyping and testing algorithms .
It is an especially good way of making sure that you actually understand how something works even if you have to do a final implementation in another language .
Visual Haskell makes it very easy to make command line executables which are useful , but not always easy to integrate into larger systems ( at least on Windows ™ ) .
Visual Haskell can be used to create DLL s and COM servers , but it is not especially straight forwards and there is no direct IDE support .
Even if you never write a single line of production code in Haskell it will still be worth learning more of it .
It will profoundly change the way that you look at programming and how you approach problems .
This is one of the best practical uses of the language because you get the benefit every time you even think about software development .
The Nobel Peace Prize was created by Alfred Nobel , the inventor of dynamite .
Nobel asked that the prize be awarded “ to the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between the nations , for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses ” .
This , unfortunately , has not always been the case .
Here are the ten most controversial recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize :
10 . Jimmy Carter
Jimmy Carter ’s 2002 Nobel Peace Prize — awarded for the “ decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts , to advance democracy and human rights , and to promote economic and social development ” — had from the start wrought controversy that was exacerbated further by politically - tinted statements offered by the chairman of the Nobel Peace Prize committee ( seconded and affirmed by Gunnar Staalsett , another member of the 5 - member , secretive Nobel Committee ) .
9. Wangari Maathai
Wangari Maathai , 2004 winner of the Nobel Peace Prize , created controversy by appearing to lend credibility to the theory that HIV was invented by white scientists to destroy black people but later apologized for giving the illusion of being a conspiracy theorist .
8. Al Gore
Al Gore won the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize for his work on raising public awareness of Global Warming .
There has been some contention on whether the work was related to the stated purpose of the prize or not .
In addition , there is much controversy surrounding his work in the area of Global Warming and , in fact , even controversy over whether Global Warming poses a real threat to mankind .
Recently a UK High Court judge decreed that the government could only send a copy of “ An Inconvenient Truth ” to every school if it was accompanied by guidelines to point out “ nine scientific errors ” and to counter his “ one - sided views ” .
In his film , Al Gore called on Americans to conserve energy by reducing electricity consumption at home .
In August 2006 , Gore ’s electricity bills revealed that in one month he burned through 22,619 kilowatts – more than twice what the average family uses in an entire year .
7. Rigoberta Menchú
Rigoberta Menchú won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1992 .
There has been some evidence pointing to her as a fraud in her purported autobiography of her life in Guatemala in the late 1950s , portrayed in her 1987 book I , Rigoberta Menchu — where some facts regarding her family history and circumstances were specifically altered by her to supposedly better propagandize her leftist - leanings ( brought to light through exposé by anthropologist David Stoll ’s researches ) .
6. Henry Kissinger
Kissinger received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1973 for his work on the Vietnam Peace Accords , despite having instituted the secret 1969 – 1975 campaign of bombing against infiltraiting NVA in Cambodia , the alleged U.S. involvement in Operation Condor — a mid-1970s campaign of kidnapping and murder coordinated among the intelligence and security services of Argentina , Bolivia , Brazil , Chile , Paraguay , and Uruguay — as well as the death of French nationals under the Chilean junta .
He also supported the invasion of Cyprus resulting in approximately 1/3 of the island being occupied by foreign troops for 33 years .
Some peace activists go so far as to suggest that the Nobel Peace Prize has become irrelevant due to Kissinger being a laureate .
5. Yitzhak Rabin
Rabin won the prize jointly with Shimon Peres and Yasser Araft in 1994 .
Rabin , while in the Israeli military , had ordered the expulsion of Arabs , from areas captured by Israel during the 1948 War .
He had also been responsible for the aggressive Israeli crackdown of the First Intifada while Defense Minister .
Rabin also continued to authorise the construction of settlements in the occupied territories despite the peace agreement .
4. Shimon Peres
Awarded the prize jointly with Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat , Peres was responsible for developing Israel ’s nuclear weapons arsenal , and was later blamed for the Qana Massacre .
The Qana Massacre occurred in 1996 when the Israeli military shelled a villiage of 800 Lebanese civilians who had gone there to escape the fighting .
106 were killed and around 116 others injured .
Four Fijian United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon soldiers were also seriously injured .
3. Yasser Arafat
Arafat won the 1994 prize along with Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin .
Arafat was regarded by critics as a terrorist leader for many years .
Kåre Kristiansen , a Norwegian member of the Nobel Committee , resigned in 1994 in protest at the awarding of a Nobel Peace Prize to Yasser Arafat , whom he labeled a “ terrorist ” .
2. Cordell Hull
Cordell Hull was awarded the Nobel Prize in Peace in 1945 in recognition of his efforts for peace and understanding in the Western Hemisphere , his trade agreements , and his work to establish the United Nations .
In 1939 , the ship SS St Louis sailed out of Hamburg into the Atlantic Ocean carrying over 950 Jewish refugees , mostly wealthy , seeking asylum from Nazi persecution just before World War II .
Roosevelt showed modest willingness to allow the ship in , but Hull , his Secretary of State threaten to withhold their support of Roosevelt in the 1940 Presidential election if this occurred .
Roosevelt denied entry to the ship .
The ship was forced to return to Germany and many of the passengers ultimately ended up dying in Concentration Camps .
1. Menachem Begin
Menachem Begin ( 6th Prime Minister of Israel ) was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1978 for his contributions to the successful closure to the Camp David Accords in the same year ( the award was jointly given to Begin and Anwar Sadat ) .
Unfortunately , Begin had also previously been head of the militant Zionist group Irgun , which is often regarded as a terrorist organization and had been responsible for the King David Hotel bombing in 1946 .
Final Thoughts
While the controversial people listed above enjoy ( or enjoyed ) their Nobel Peace prizes , Mahatma Gandhi was never awarded one ( though he was nominated five times ) .
In addition , in the fields of science , great men such as Nicola Tesla and Thomas Edison were not awarded prizes because of their animosity towards each other .
If Tesla had won , the money would probably have prevented him from filing for bankruptcy in 1916 , and the face of modern society may have been very different .

Mr Murray is working as normal : picture courtesy of MEN
Ian Murray , a Cheadle Hulme taxi driver who has served on the bench for 12 years , walked out of Manchester Magistrates ' Court on Thursday .
Zoobia Hussain , 32 , of Crumpsall , who is charged with criminal damage , plans to write and complain , her lawyer said .
Mr Murray said he had been concerned about the defendant 's identity .
' Deeply embarrassed '
If a complaint is received , Mr Murray will automatically face an internal investigation , a spokesman for the Judiciary of England and Wales said .
Hussain 's lawyer , Judith Hawkins , said : " She [ Mrs Hussain ] remains shocked and distressed .
Mrs Hussain remains shocked and distressed
Mrs Hussain 's lawyer , Judith Hawkins
" She suffered hurt feelings and felt intimidated and deeply embarrassed by the treatment she received at court .
" She is also concerned for the feelings of others who were present in court . "
Mrs Hussain covered her entire face apart from her eyes when she faced the three magistrates .
A statement from the Judiciary of England and Wales said : " Mr Murray is concerned about questions of identity when the full veil is worn in court .
" However , he agrees that he acted unwisely in disqualifying himself without giving reasons , and acknowledges that he should have sought the advice of his legal advisor in court , and discussed the provisions of the national guidelines with his colleagues on the bench , before taking action .
" Mr Murray is supportive of those of different faiths and cultural traditions and acknowledges and regrets his action could be misinterpreted . "
Mr Murray is " continuing to work as normal " while no complaint exists , a judiciary spokesman said .
Mrs Hussain 's case was dealt with immediately after Mr Murray withdrew and was adjourned until 18 July .

Captain Lance is angry at crew member Karen .
Karen
Shueh , a cherubic store clerk , has arrived with the words everything will be taken away written backward on her forehead in black ink .
She ’s participating in a public - art project .
“ The artist is Adrian Piper !
She deals with the politics of viewing and the power of looking at people . ”
Lance frowns and grunts out the closest thing to a Trader Joe ’s reprimand : “ I ca n’t have people with words on their forehead working here ! ”
Karen scowls and trudges toward the bread aisle .
It ’s early summer and I ’m elbow - deep in the rye - bread drawer , midway through a 6 p.m. –to–2 a.m. shift on my new job , crew member at Trader Joe ’s on 14th Street , the first city outpost of the West Coast foodie retailer , which has been gridlocked with shoppers since its opening in March 2006 .
It serves up Tofutti bars , pappadam chips , and reams of gluten - free , dairy - free , and sodium - free organic grub on the cheap .
The 14th Street store grosses over $ 1 million weekly ; it ’s apparently one of the highest - grossing locations of the 285 nationwide .
It is , in a sense , the poor man ’s Union Square Whole Foods , one fifth the size and in the armpit of the square .
A second city location opened in Forest Hills on October 26 ; next up , one on Court Street in Cobble Hill .
But those customers do n’t come in for the hummus and low prices alone .
Supermarket employees have never looked so appetizing , or so poignantly arty — remember Jake Gyllenhaal cast implausibly as a stock boy who thought he was Holden Caulfield in The Good Girl ?
That ’s the sort of person Trader Joe ’s seems to recruit .
The store uses cute , clean - looking , multiethnic twentysomethings in the same way as other hip retailers ( say , Urban Outfitters ) :
It ’s part of the shopping experience .
To see what it ’s like , I decided to work there .
It turned out to be frustratingly difficult to get hired .
The Joe ’s employees are less - established versions of the typical Trader Joe ’s shopper :
Our customers “ read The New Yorker , not People magazine , ” explains an employee handout .
So does the floor staff .
( It ’s not surprising that there are non-Gyllenhaalian workers unloading pallets after - hours . )
Today ’s crew includes a filmmaker , an actor , two fashion students , two painters , a film - production intern , and a martial artist .
They ’re mostly college graduates — University of Washington , New York University , the University of Maine — here with dreams of making it in the city ’s bourgeois bohemia , but currently stuck serving it hummus .
Most are from comfortable backgrounds .
The young workers are attracted to Trader Joe ’s for its groovy , noncorporate aura and also because it , unlike most of the sorts of jobs arty kids do while waiting for their big break , offers health insurance .
Karen , a peppy Northwestern graduate , hurls expired breads at a cart while happily talking to me at full volume — her only volume — and pulling at her red Raggedy - Ann skirt .
She falls silent only during our involuntary gagging at wet moldy bread .
She wants to be a studio assistant or perhaps work at a public - art organization like Creative Time , and works at three galleries and sneaks into art lectures at Barnard .
Trader Joe ’s serves as her art supply : “ I take unused receipts and dried onions and corn husks .
The utility knife they give us has been very useful .
And those huge Saran wraps that the grocery pallets come in — I love those !
I take those home . ”
Some of her work has been shown at P.S. 122 .
But for now , she ’s mired in the bread aisle — “ Breadway . ”
For her efforts , Karen , 23 , makes $ 11.25 an hour , in the middle of the $ 9.50 - to - $ 12.50 crew range , minus $ 92 per month for health insurance .
She also spends hundreds on food at a 10 percent discount .
Shanice , a 21 - year - old CUNY student carrying a clipboard , hollers over .
“ Hey , Karen , ai n’t you supposed to be on register ?
They lookin’ for you . ”
Karen hates register .
She whimpers to Shanice about how occupied she is in Breadway .
Shanice raises her eyebrows .
I ’m left alone , squatting to reach the bottom - shelf pitas near the doorway .
Two black stiletto boots appear an inch from my nose .
A woman in a bright - orange blouse asks me for a product that sounds like “ oloveria juice . ”
I check the shelf and ask her to spell the name .
She sneers : “ You should know how to spell aloe . ”

It ’s not easy to enlist with Trader Joe’s .
I dropped off an application that represented me as well qualified ( college grad , extensive retail experience ) .
Silence ensued .
I called six times .
On the seventh , a manager sighed and scheduled an interview so that I would stop calling .
My interview took place in a citrus - smelling stockroom corner .
“ You ’re lucky you got an interview , ” said Gregory , a distractingly handsome manager , pointing to the weekly stack of 200 applications .
“ If you do n’t hear from us in a week , well … that ’s the breaks . ”
I did n’t hear in a week .
So I called some more .
An important part of the Trader Joe ’s experience is the mandatory three - hour “ Captain ’s Talk . ”
Captain Lance ’s job is to keep the crew shipshape .
Trader Joe ’s is one of those companies where the culture pretends that the work is fun .
Lance is a jovial , chubby , goateed guy , a dedicated and relentlessly wholesome company devotee .
About a quarter of the staff fits this description .
Lance lives 90 minutes away , in New Jersey , and has worked in other Trader Joe ’s across the country .
He is a spouter of state - of - the - art corporatespeak , like “ kaizen . ” Kaizen is supposedly Japanese for “ one percent improvement each day . ”
Staffers seem to think it means helping others , or they deploy it sarcastically ( “ Let ’s kaizen , guys ! ” ) .
Lance has a lot of hokeyness to catch the new hires up on .
In the store ’s nautical parlance , there are captains , first mates , second mates , merchants , novitiates , and crew members ( better known to gay customers as “ hot sailors ” ) .
Lance gabbed for a while about the “ wow customer experience ” and pointed at us .
“ Everyone is coming in because of you .
They want to see you and you and you ! ”
The high point came when we each had to read aloud from a gooey company pamphlet called “ Customer Experience : A Trader Joe ’s Love Story . ”
Another new hire , a Pete Doherty look - alike in a black Johnny Thunders Born to Cry T - shirt , a black fedora , and black jeans , spoke in a flat monotone : “ Without [ customers ] , we ’d be lonely , bored , and lovesick .
Yes , we can build a beautifully elaborate cruise ship out of cases of pineapple , but if no one comes to buy any … we ’re sunk . ”
As a new employee , I am assigned to a warm , mid-twenties clerk who is also directing a Restoration comedy , dramaturging a friend ’s show , and performing in a comedy troupe .
But she has a lot of student - loan debt , so in addition to Trader Joe ’s , she ’s a waitress .
Today , she also has a cold .
“ We get eight colds a year from the people coming through , ” she says .
We stalk Rachel Dratch through the store and laugh hysterically while watching a safety video called “ More Wow , Less Ow . ”
And then the fun is over .
She hands me a back brace and work gloves .
I ’m supposed to stock produce “ with energy ” and “ with both hands . ”
Five thousand daily customers means that 50,000 items need to be restocked ( 1,500 by me ) .
It ’s entertaining in short spurts .
You dance to the music and break all your nails instantly .
The orange - brown floors and walls are pleasant .
Concrete tasks are strangely fulfilling .
“ Arianne , stock the tomatoes . ” I can do that .
For a few hours , anyway .
Nonstop manual work is unforgiving and makes cubicle hell alluring .
You ’re prostrate to a punch - in clock , in nine - hour spurts that quickly spiral into a miserable flume of muscle pain and ennui .
Merchant Vinny is the oldest - looking 22 - year - old kid you ’ve ever seen , which might be related to his commute from Danbury , Connecticut .
He leaves the store at 1 a.m. , hops on Metro - North , and arrives home at 3 a.m .
This struck me as strange until Gregory , the guy who hired me , mentioned that he used to commute 90 minutes from Brooklyn to their store in Westchester “ to get in with the company . ”
Vinny tells me to come at midnight for a tasting party .
“ You ’re held to a higher standard here .
Unlike at Shop Rite , you need to tell customers about their food . ”
I arrive to find 45 employees gathered around fold - up tables along the meat wall .
Ten crew members from the morning shift are here , along with dozens of artists of indeterminate art — only the fashion graduates are discernible , in buttoned cardigans and tank tops created from Trader Joe ’s T - shirts .
It ’s a cliquey crowd , not unlike high school , but devoid of Queen Bee girls and King Jock guys .
It seems odd to me that such a smart , creative group would come back at midnight by choice .
Melody Louisdhon , a bubbly girl I ’ve seen many times , stands giggling in the corner , despite the fact that she no longer works here .
She came because , for these kids , the city can be a hostile place .
It ’s a cabless lifestyle of fearing the mailbox , and college friends who have moved on to jobs in their fields and who do n’t understand .
The tasting features friends who understand and free grub .
And sex .
The crew can seem like an ongoing soap opera of sleeping around .
Much of the sex is born out of the job : Crew members are constantly mobile , able to strategically station themselves alongside whomever they ’d like .
Once the store empties at night , I watched flirting extend to groping .
After work , they frequent Beauty Bar down the street and sometimes go home together .
It ’s the only activity they can afford .
The tasting buzzes with last night ’s gossip , something about a crew member sleeping with his girlfriend ’s roommate .
He ’s a “ Trader Joe Ho , ” a term mainly reserved for guys , who see far more action than you ’d expect for impoverished grocery workers .
“ My theory on it , ” says Melody , who ’s 22 , “ is that the only people the girls see are the guys at work .
It ’s slim pickings , so they pick the best of the bunch . ”
Melody ’s rundown of recent staff activities is a bewildering chronicle of secret assignations and multiple partners , complete with character analysis ( “ She ’s very clingy and has mothering issues ” ) .
Everybody seems to know everybody else ’s business and is getting busy with them , too .
With little money and rotating schedules , relationships die quickly .
On a crew of hundreds , one of the few long - term couples I saw was Konny Lopez and Josh LaFaze — and they came prepackaged .
“ My boyfriend ’s from SoCal and he told me what a great company it was , ” says Konny , 21 , a senior studying filmmaking at the New School .
So she and Josh , 24 , filled out applications together .
She knew they were unusual .
“ Long - term relationships are definitely not the norm .
It ’s just a stressful work environment and turnover ’s high , and so the turnover for relationships is , too . ”
Ahmed Alabaca and Clyff join us .
Clyff , who went to art school , with black eyes and spiky black hair , would like to get in on the after - hours action .
“ Just walk up to her while she ’s stocking , ” says Ahmed .
“ Say , ‘ I think we should get to know each other , baby . ’”
Clyff considers this , tapping his fork against his chin .
He tries it .
“ Hey , ba -by . ” I suggest that he try complimenting her outfit ( the part that ’s not a regulation T - shirt ) , then asking her out for a drink .
He practices on me , with just enough nervousness that I want to say yes .
Today ’s crew includes a filmmaker , an actor , two fashion students , and two painters , here to make it big .
Until then , they make hummus .
He wanders off , leaving me with Ahmed , 23 , a composer fifteen minutes into his three - movement masterpiece , which he pecks at daily from 1 to 7 a.m .
He plays with the Brooklyn Symphony Orchestra and is nursing a rejection by the Manhattan School of Music .
I frequently see him jotting down rhythms on receipt paper , singing in the frozen - food aisle , and drumming carts .
Once he gets into , say , stocking tofu , he can compose in his head .
He is perhaps the least - disgruntled staffer , because his previous jobs were worse .
He worked at Jamba Juice for $ 8.25 an hour , for a boss he describes as “ very sexist and grabbing on people . ”
Benefits were ostensibly available , yet he did n’t have the hours to access them .
Then he worked at New York Sports Club for $ 7 an hour .
To him , Trader Joe ’s , and its nautical lingo , does n’t seem bad at all .
“ It ’s like a crew on a boat .
You ’re on an ocean for years and years .
And this becomes your family . ”
He shares a railroad bedroom in Bushwick and pays $ 325 a month .
“ In layman terms , it ’s ghetto , but it ’s nice actually . ”
His pay has gone up from $ 10.75 to $ 11.20 an hour , and he ’s helped out financially by his roommate , who works at John Varvatos .
“ The pay is decent for what my bills are , ” he says .
“ But most people here move to non-affordable places like Williamsburg or Astoria . ”
I kept seeing Melody hanging around .
A pretty 2006 New School grad with high cheekbones and thick lips , she never thought she ’d get dragooned into Trader Navy .
We met at a burrito joint in South Williamsburg , where she pays $ 867 a month .
“ I made sure that I was the best college intern at MTV for two semesters , in the best internship that led to the best job .
My thesis was done early , my apartment was ready to go , I had my job in the bag . ”
Then MTV downsized her division .
Melody flailed in freelance production - assistant work , panicked , and was enticed by the steady paycheck , health insurance , and flexible hours .
The trouble is , “ flexible ” hours can be a wash cycle of preassigned rotating shifts spanning 5 a.m. to 2 a.m .
The break room ’s message board was peppered with crew members ’ begging to swap shifts to attend auditions and shows .
Actors and musicians realize that they ’re already working a lot — most work 36 hours a week — so they might as well go full time and bank the extra money and 15 percent retirement fund .
( Unlike a lot of big supermarket chains , Trader Joe ’s is n’t unionized . )
It can take even more gumption to get out of Trader Joe ’s than it does to get in .
“ After six months , I was like , ‘ Okay , Melody .
You do not want to be here . ’”
She began interviewing for jobs in TV .
“ I would be in an apron , making garlic - hummus samples .
Then I ’d go into the kitchen , frantically change into a suit and makeup , spray myself with massive amounts of perfume to cover the garlic , dive across town , rush back , sneak into the store , put the apron on , and say , ‘ Want some garlic hummus ? ’ ”
Eventually , the Oxygen Network hired her as a programming assistant .
She gave two weeks ’ notice , but for one of those weeks she worked both jobs , 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. at the Oxygen Network and until 11 p.m. at Trader Joe’s .
“ I felt bad because I would ’ve left them shorthanded , and you ca n’t screw over your friends , ” she says .
Which all leads to the pressing question :
Why is Melody still at Trader Joe ’s daily ?
“ Because my friends are at Trader Joe ’s more than they ’re at home . ”
And some ca n’t afford cell phones .
“ If I want to talk to them , I have to go to the store .
Last night , I went in to ask what movie we were going to . ”
It ’s Friday night .
Chaos in the chips aisle .
The variety of products — twelve types of salsa !— makes me begin to understand the necessity of that tasting .
The questions are relentless :
What are the black marks on the flaxseed chips ?
( Flaxseeds . )
Do you carry sweet - potato chips ?
( I ’m sorry , ma’am .
Here at Trader Joe ’s , we rotate out a quarter of our 4,000 products so that we can introduce you to new exciting foods !
Like the parsnip chips !
Would you like to try ? )
I unload chunky salsa , peach salsa , corn salsa , salsa verde , chipotle salsa , salsa auténtica .
I decide that the glass jars are exceedingly well designed because they do n’t break when I drop them .
More shoppers surge in , and my shoulders ache from the surprisingly heavy salsa .
Carpal - tunnel problems are common on the crew ; I ’m doped up on muscle relaxants to quell a lower - back problem .
Finally , I drop a jar from the top shelf .
It was inevitable .
It shatters , splattering my sneakers in salsa .
People cheer .
I am reassigned to stamping salmon expiration dates , this time with Daeha , a droll screenwriter and University of Washington grad who has n’t cut his hair in two years .
He somehow pulls off a leg - length ponytail with hipster glasses .
Today is his 29th birthday .
At 1 a.m. , Daeha and I spend an hour discussing dialogue writing .
Daeha reads court transcripts to study speech cadences .
He lives at the Chelsea Center hostel , where in exchange for a free room he cleans during the day , then works nights here .
I gently point out that he ’s essentially working sixteen - hour days to break even .
But he ’s hardly alone in that in New York these days .
Facebook has banned photos of breast - feeding .
But such images have graced churches and art galleries for hundreds of years .
Ruth Moss explores what went wrong
Facebook , the social networking website with over 39 million users , has started removing breastfeeding photographs posted by its users .
Why ?
Apparently they contravene its obscenity policy .
Before you begin to tut , let ’s understand the idea behind this decision .
The makers of Facebook ca n’t police all the photographs on their site and consequently – apparently – remove every photograph that displays exposed breasts .
They want to be fair .
If a woman has a topless photograph removed , she could point to a breastfeeding picture and say : “ Well you can see her breast too .
Why is she allowed that photograph but not me ? ”
One could argue that in the majority of breastfeeding pictures , you ca n’t see that much breast anyway .
You can actually see more exposed breast in a picture of a woman in a bikini than you can in a picture of a woman nursing her infant .
However , I think this ignores the larger point .
How on earth did we get to a point where we could even consider images of breastfeeding obscene ?
Consider that , as far back as the 12th century , images of breastfeeding were commonplace in Europe , mainly in churches as symbols of the Madonna and Child .
Many of these images are not at all what we would term discreet .
Baby ’s face is not covered with a cloth .
The mother is shown ‘ letting it all hang out ’ , showing – shock horror – an entire breast uncovered !
Travel forward to the 14th century , and you have an artist such as Jean Fouquet , who painted a mother who is not even feeding her child , but preparing to feed him , showing an entire breast including nipple under her undone top .
Same century , take a look at one of Luca Signorelli ’s paintings , showing a woman holding her own breast , expressing milk into her toddler ’s ( yes , I said toddler ) eager mouth .
Skip a few centuries - full of breastfeeding images and we come to Pablo Picasso , of course , in the early 20th century , depicting a woman in a pink dress feeding her baby , hand clutching a breast full of milk .
The 1920s ’ image that sticks in my mind is the Mary Cassatt painting of a woman with her dress loosened to feed her baby , who is more interested in playing with her face ( my son is going through that phase at the moment .
It ’s both amusing and maddening ) .
But from the 1930s ’ up until today , the images of breastfeeding in European art become fewer .
Cut to the 20th and 21st centuries and what images of breasts do we see constantly ?
Pictures of gravity - defying breasts in ‘ lads ’ mags ’ such as Zoo , Nuts and Loaded , not to mention Page 3 .
Nearly every time you switch on MTV Dance , you ’re greeted with a bevy of scantily clad dancers dressed to titillate male heterosexual fantasies , bumping and grinding their pneumatic boobs .
So , what happened ?
It seems more than a coincidence that the reduction of breastfeeding images in art coincides with the rise of infant formula and bottle feeding .
In 1845 , the India rubber nipple for the bottle was invented and the first commercially available infant formula was invented in 1867 .
In the late 1950s ’ , the formula Enfamil targeted a marketing campaign at hospitals and from then on , the instance of formula - feeding rocketed and we ’ve never quite recovered .
( Please do n’t think , by the way , that this is yet another go at mothers who choose to bottle - feed their babies .
There are more than enough people out there who want to put mothers down for the choices they make .
I ’m not one of them . )
So here ’s my theory , for what it ’s worth .
It ’s a vicious circle .
The marketing men ( and yes , they were mainly men ) start to push infant formula to mothers .
Breastfeeding is undermined .
We see fewer and fewer women breastfeeding in public .
It becomes the exception rather than the rule .
Fewer pictures are taken or painted of breastfeeding mothers .
Well – after all , there are n’t many left to paint !
And then enter Page 3 , in 1970 .
It ’s not that breasts were n’t sexual before , but now , without their primary function , they are purely sexual .
So women start to feel embarrassed at getting a breast out in public to feed a baby , because , well , you would n’t want a man to see it would you ?
And the trend towards the sexualisation of the breast continues .
In 1994 , Loaded magazine was launched .
By now if you do breastfeed in public , well , all right , I suppose , but you ’d better be discreet , cover up , after all .
Ten years ’ later and we see the launch of Nuts and Zoo and eventually Facebook .
And now , with popular culture absolutely saturated with images of breasts as purely sexual objects , we ca n’t see a breast at all without thinking it is purely sexual .
Facebook , wanting to ensure its users are n’t exposed to explicit material , ban all pictures of exposed breast as “ obscene ” and that ’s how we got here .
When discussing this matter with friends , I had mainly supportive comments , but also had a few negative comments along the lines of : “ I do n’t mind breastfeeding , but why would you want to take a picture of it ? ”
One breastfeeding mother on Facebook even suggested that there is “ nothing wrong with feeding in public , but you should at least be discreet and take a muslin sheet out with you ” .
I say to breastfeeding mothers , be discreet if that ’s your choice , but if you want to , feel free to ‘ whip ’em out ’ and let your baby suckle .
Do n’t let anyone put you off .
Take a look at pictures of breastfeeding mothers through the ages at a website such as www.breastfeedingart.net and perhaps try out a few of the poses that were deemed so acceptable they were hung in churches and are still hung in public art galleries .
Take pictures of yourself nursing your baby and share them with your friends and family .
Get some modern images of breasts being used for the original purpose intended by nature out there in the public domain .
And whether you breastfeed discreetly , whip ’em out , bottle - feed or do n’t have children , please , every time you see a picture of a “ bikini clad beauty revealing all ” , remember that breasts have a primary function too , and this is n’t it !
And of course , if you ’re a Facebook user , join the “ hey Facebook , breastfeeding is not obscene ” petition , currently running at over 20,000 people .
Then perhaps , one day , we wo n’t be embarrassed by images of breastfeeding , but rather feel slightly icky about images of breasts as purely sexual objects .

This story gets worse and worse with every passing minute :
A source involved with the mayor 's operations at the time tells CBS 2 HD that Nathan took flagrant advantage of that police car and driver .
The source says Nathan forced police to chauffeur her friends and family around the city -- even when she was n't in the car .
That set off alarms with ethics watchdogs .
" The rules are clear , you can't use city resources for private reasons , " said Gene Russianoff of the New York Public Interest Research Group .
" And if you 're using a city car , a police driven car to chauffeur around relatives , unless they 're explicitly protected and their deemed to be the subject of potential security threats , it 's just wrong . "
NYPD officers , chauffeuring around not just the mayor 's girlfriend , but her friends and family , too .
Nice .
' Cuz they 're too good to deal with traffic , like the rest of you scum .
Oh , you wanna see another neat trick ?
Watch this :
Nathan 's detail was approved by the NYPD after a stranger made an unspecified threat to her .
The commissioner at the time was Bernard Kerik , who was recently indicted on tax fraud charges in an unrelated matter .
Some stranger .
Unspecified threat .
OK , whatever .
And , oh yeah , let 's tooooootally believe Bernie Kerik .
Right ?
Bahahaha !
Meanwhile , ask Rudy to explain himself and what do you get ?

IT ’S Monday morning , and you ’re having trouble waking your teenagers .
You ’re not alone .
Indeed , each morning , few of the country ’s 17 million high school students are awake enough to get much out of their first class , particularly if it starts before 8 a.m .
Sure , many of them stayed up too late the night before , but not because they wanted to .
Research shows that teenagers ’ body clocks are set to a schedule that is different from that of younger children or adults .
This prevents adolescents from dropping off until around 11 p.m. , when they produce the sleep - inducing hormone melatonin , and waking up much before 8 a.m. when their bodies stop producing melatonin .
The result is that the first class of the morning is often a waste , with as many as 28 percent of students falling asleep , according to a National Sleep Foundation poll .
Some are so sleepy they do n’t even show up , contributing to failure and dropout rates .
Many of our presidential candidates have been relatively silent on how they plan to save our troubled education system .
For those still searching for a policy that might have a positive impact , here ’s an idea : stop focusing on testing and instead support changing the hours of the school day , starting it later for teenagers and ending it later for all children .
Indeed , no one does well when they ’re sleep - deprived , but insufficient sleep among children has been linked to obesity and to learning issues like attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder .
You ’d think this would spur educators to take action , and a handful have .
Parasitic sea lice infestations caused by salmon farms are driving nearby populations of wild salmon toward extinction .
The results show that the affected pink salmon populations have been rapidly declining for four years .
The scientists expect a 99 % collapse in another four years , or two salmon generations , if the infestations continue .
" The impact is so severe that the viability of the wild salmon populations is threatened , " says lead author of a new article in Science ( December 14 ) Martin Krkosek , a fisheries ecologist from the University of Alberta .
Krkosek and his co-authors calculate that sea lice have killed more than 80 % of the annual pink salmon returns to British Columbia 's Broughton Archipelago .
" If nothing changes , we are going to lose these fish . "
Previous peer - reviewed papers by Krkosek and others showed that sea lice from fish farms can infect and kill juvenile wild salmon .
This , however , is the first study to examine the population - level effects on the wild salmon stocks .
" It shows there is a real danger to wild populations from the impact of farms , " says Ray Hilborn , a fisheries biologist from the University of Washington who was not involved in the study .
" The data for individual populations are highly variable .
But there is so much of it , it is pretty persuasive that salmon populations affected by farms are rapidly declining . "
According to experts , the study also raises serious concerns about large - scale proposals for net pen aquaculture of other species and the potential for pathogen transfer to wild populations .
" This paper is really about a lot more than salmon , " says Hilborn .
" It is about the impacts of net pen aquaculture on wild fish .
This is the first study where we can evaluate these interactions and it certainly raises serious concerns about proposed aquaculture for other species such as cod , halibut and sablefish . "
The data are from the Broughton Archipelago , a group of islands and channels about 260 miles northwest of Vancouver that is environmentally , culturally , and economically dependent on wild salmon .
To pinpoint the effect of salmon farms , the study used a large dataset collected by the Canadian federal government 's Department of Fisheries and Oceans ( Fisheries and Ocean Canada ) that estimates how many adult salmon return from the ocean to British Columbia 's rivers each year .
Extending back to 1970 , the data covers 14 populations of pink salmon ( Onchorhynchus gorbuscha ) that have been exposed to salmon farms , and 128 populations that have not .

Sea lice ( Lepeophtheirus salmonis ) are naturally occurring parasites of wild salmon that latch onto the fishes ' skin in the open ocean .
The lice are transmitted by a tiny free - swimming larval stage .
Open - net salmon farms are a haven for these parasites , which feed on the fishes ' skin and muscle tissue .
Adult salmon can survive a small number of lice , but juveniles headed from the river to the sea are very small , thin - skinned , and vulnerable .
In the Broughton Archipelago , the juvenile salmon must run an 80 - kilometer gauntlet of fish farms before they reach the open ocean .
" Salmon farming breaks a natural law , " says co-author Alexandra Morton , director of the Salmon Coast Field Station , located in the Broughton .
" In the natural system , the youngest salmon are not exposed to sea lice because the adult salmon that carry the parasite are offshore .
But fish farms cause a deadly collision between the vulnerable young salmon and sea lice .
They are not equipped to survive this , and they do n't . "
Salmon bring nutrients from the open ocean back to the coastal ecosystem .
Killer whales , bears , wolves , birds , and even trees depend on pink salmon .
" If you lose wild salmon there 's a lot you are going to lose with them -- including other industries such as fishing and tourism , " says Krkosek .
" An important finding of this paper is that the impact of the sea lice is so large that it exceeds that of the commercial fishery that used to exist here , " says Jennifer Ford , a co-author and fisheries scientist .
" Since the infestations began , the fishery has been closed and the salmon stocks have continued declining . "
" In the Broughton there are just too many farmed fish in the water .
If there were only one salmon farm this problem probably would n't exist , " Krkosek says .
" Over the years the number of farmed fish has increased , " says Morton .
" There used to be only a few farms , each holding about 125,000 fish .
But now we have over 20 farms , some holding 1.3 million fish .
The farmed fish are providing a habitat for lice that was n't there before . "

The researchers observed that when farms on a primary migration route were temporarily shut down , or fallowed , sea lice numbers dropped and salmon populations increased .
" Even though they have complicated migration patterns they all have one thing in common -- overall , the populations that are declining are the ones that are going past the farms , " says Mark Lewis , a mathematical ecologist at the University of Alberta .
" There are two solutions that may work -- closed containment , and moving farms away from rivers , " says Lewis .
Closed containment means moving the salmon to pens that are completely sealed off from the surrounding environment in contrast to the open - net pens currently in use .
In a May 16 , 2007 provincial government report , the B.C. Special Committee on Sustainable Aquaculture recommended a move towards closed containment within 5 years .
" If industry says it 's too expensive to move the fish farms or contain them , they are actually saying the natural system must continue to pay the price , " says Daniel Pauly , Director of the University of British Columbia 's Fisheries Centre , who was not involved with the study .
" They are , as economists would say , externalizing the costs of fish farming on the wild salmon and the public . "
Morton , who has been studying the impacts of aquaculture for 20 years , says that , " Wild salmon are enormously important to the ecosystem , economies , and culture .
Now it is clear they are disappearing in place of an industry .
People need to know this and make a decision what they want : industry - produced salmon or wild salmon . "

THE SCANDAL unfolding around the firing of eight U.S. attorneys compels the conclusion that the Bush administration has rewarded loyalty over all else .
A destructive pattern of partisan political actions at the Justice Department started long before this incident , however , as those of us who worked in its civil rights division can attest .
I spent more than 35 years in the department enforcing federal civil rights laws — particularly voting rights .
Before leaving in 2005 , I worked for attorneys general with dramatically different political philosophies — from John Mitchell to Ed Meese to Janet Reno .
Regardless of the administration , the political appointees had respect for the experience and judgment of longtime civil servants .
Under the Bush administration , however , all that changed .
Over the last six years , this Justice Department has ignored the advice of its staff and skewed aspects of law enforcement in ways that clearly were intended to influence the outcome of elections .
It has notably shirked its legal responsibility to protect voting rights .
From 2001 to 2006 , no voting discrimination cases were brought on behalf of African American or Native American voters .
U.S. attorneys were told instead to give priority to voter fraud cases , which , when coupled with the strong support for voter ID laws , indicated an intent to depress voter turnout in minority and poor communities .
At least two of the recently fired U.S. attorneys , John McKay in Seattle and David C. Iglesias in New Mexico , were targeted largely because they refused to prosecute voting fraud cases that implicated Democrats or voters likely to vote for Democrats .
This pattern also extended to hiring .
In March 2006 , Bradley Schlozman was appointed interim U.S. attorney in Kansas City , Mo . Two weeks earlier , the administration was granted the authority to make such indefinite appointments without Senate confirmation .
That was too bad : A Senate hearing might have uncovered Schlozman ’s central role in politicizing the civil rights division during his three - year tenure .
Schlozman , for instance , was part of the team of political appointees that approved then - House Majority Leader Tom DeLay ’s plan to redraw congressional districts in Texas , which in 2004 increased the number of Republicans elected to the House .
Similarly , Schlozman was acting assistant attorney general in charge of the division when the Justice Department OKd a Georgia law requiring voters to show photo IDs at the polls .
These decisions went against the recommendations of career staff , who asserted that such rulings discriminated against minority voters .
The warnings were prescient : Both proposals were struck down by federal courts .
Schlozman continued to influence elections as an interim U.S. attorney .
Missouri had one of the closest Senate races in the country last November , and a week before the election , Schlozman brought four voter fraud indictments against members of an organization representing poor and minority people .
This blatantly contradicted the department ’s long - standing policy to wait until after an election to bring such indictments because a federal criminal investigation might affect the outcome of the vote .
The timing of the Missouri indictments could not have made the administration ’s aims more transparent .
This administration is also politicizing the career staff of the Justice Department .
Outright hostility to career employees who disagreed with the political appointees was evident early on .
Seven career managers were removed in the civil rights division .
I personally was ordered to change performance evaluations of several attorneys under my supervision .
I was told to include critical comments about those whose recommendations ran counter to the political will of the administration and to improve evaluations of those who were politically favored .
Morale plummeted , resulting in an alarming exodus of career attorneys .
In the last two years , 55 % to 60 % of attorneys in the voting section have transferred to other departments or left the Justice Department entirely .
At the same time , career staff were nearly cut out of the process of hiring lawyers .
Control of hiring went to political appointees , so an applicant ’s fidelity to GOP interests replaced civil rights experience as the most important factor in hiring decisions .
For decades prior to this administration , the Justice Department had successfully kept politics out of its law enforcement decisions .
Hopefully , the spotlight on this misconduct will begin the process of restoring dignity and nonpartisanship to federal law enforcement .
As the 2008 elections approach , it is critical to have a Justice Department that approaches its responsibility to all eligible voters without favor .

The Bush administration has taken a staunch " no nukes " approach to Iran , rarely differentiating between nuclear power and weapons , but when asked about Iran 's nuclear program this morning on This Week , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice claims that the U.S. has absolutely no problem with Iran having nuclear power , they just need to give up their goal of producing nuclear weapons .
Uh oh , I think somebody is going to be getting a nasty phone call from Dick Cheney very soon ...
Rice : " ... We have not even rejected the idea that Iran should have civil nuclear power and in fact , would be prepared under certain circumstances to participate in that .
They just have to give up the fuel cycle -- the enrichment and reprocessing that can lead to the technologies that can lead to a nuclear weapon .
Rice is also asked about the Kyl / Lieberman amendment and if the Bush Administration intends to use it as an excuse to invade Iran .
Condi reassures Stephanopoulos that the president 's powers to protect the country are fully intact -- essentially saying he does n't need the amendment to invade , but that they had no plans to move on it .
Um , why does n't that reassure me ?

Japan says its whaling is for research purposes
Media reports say an Australian customs vessel saw five whales being harpooned and hauled on to a Japanese ship .
The Japanese fleet had stopped hunting for three weeks while it was pursued in Antarctic waters by the campaigners .
Australian Foreign Minister Stephen Smith held talks with his Japanese counterpart in Tokyo on the issue .
A ministry spokesman said Mr Smith had " expressed disappointment that whaling had resumed in the Southern Ocean " .
He also " conveyed the Australian government 's strongly held view that Japan 's whaling programme should cease " .
But the two had " agreed to disagree " on whaling .
Protesters ' return ?
Before the meeting , Japan 's Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura told reporters the issue would " inevitably " be raised .
" Minister Smith may bring up the whaling issue , or I may bring up the harassment issue , " he told reporters .
Australia has declared a whale sanctuary in parts of the Southern Ocean where the Japanese fleet has been , but Japan does not accept Canberra 's authority .
As the protesters left the scene , a member of the Sea Shepherd group vowed to come back and continue harassing the whaling fleet .
" This is a retreat for supplies only .
We have not surrendered the sanctuary to the whale killers , " Paul Watson said .
The Japanese fleet plans to kill about 900 minke whales and 50 fin whales by mid-April as part of what it describes as a scientific research programme .
Other nations and environment groups say the research goals could be achieved using non-lethal methods , and call the programme a front for commercial whaling .
Concerned that a midday snooze might ruin a good night 's sleep ?
Fret not ; ongoing research from NewYork - Presbyterian Hospital / Weill Cornell Medical Center indicates that napping has little effect on sleep onset -- and that a nap today may be beneficial for mental processing tomorrow .
People over age 60 sleep two hours less per night than their younger counterparts .
Patricia Murphy and Scott Campbell , associate director and director , respectively , of the Human Chronobiology Laboratory at NewYork - Presbyterian / Weill Cornell , have evidence that a midday nap may improve daytime performance and mood in the elderly and others .
Their research subjects are all normal sleepers .
" By learning more about how normal people sleep , we may gain a better understanding of what is happening in the bodies and minds of those with sleep disorders , " says Murphy .
Study participants spend several sessions in the sleep lab , attached to scalp electrodes and a wrist activity monitor that record their sleep and wakefulness states .
They are then asked to perform arithmetic , decision - making and reaction time tests after napping and on the following day .
The subjects showed improved cognitive performance immediately after a nap and into the next day , when compared with days that did n't include ( and were n't preceded by a day with ) a nap .
Napping did not seem to affect nighttime sleep .
COALINGA , Calif . 
When any of the 5,300 inmates at Pleasant Valley State Prison begin coughing and running a fever , doctors do not think flu , bronchitis or even the common cold .
They think valley fever ; and , more often than they would like , they are right .
In the past three years , more than 900 inmates at the prison have contracted the fever , a fungal infection that has been both widespread and lethal .
At least a dozen inmates here in Central California have died from the disease , which is on the rise in other Western states , including Arizona , where the health department declared an epidemic after more than 5,500 cases were reported in 2006 , including 33 deaths .
Endemic to parts of the Southwest , valley fever has been reported in recent years in a widening belt from South Texas to Northern California .
The disease has infected archaeologists digging at the Dinosaur National Monument in Utah and dogs that have inhaled the spores while sniffing for illegal drugs along the Mexican border .
AUGUST 20 -- Next year , the U.S. military will begin production of a new line of Meals , Ready - to - Eat , those indestructible chow packages that help sustain American soldiers .
MREs , which are distributed to servicemen during operations where regular meal preparation is not possible , are packaged to last for three years ( or six months in 100 degree temperatures ) .
The new MREs were developed , in part , after a late - 2005 taste test involving 400 soldiers stationed at Fort Greeley in Alaska .
Each serviceman involved in the field evaluation filled out comment forms , which were then compiled in a report prepared by Department of Defense officials .
A copy of that entertaining document , filled with the blunt appraisals of junior Frank Brunis , can be found below .
Eight complete meals were tested , with mixed results .
One soldier complained that a chicken and dumplings MRE triggered , 'a flatulence symphony in my tent all night . '
A stuffed cabbage MRE led one evaluator to exclaim , ' The meal sucked !
Do you even try this crap before you give it to us ? '
That same MRE also led another reviewer to write , ' Do n't ever give the stuffed cabbage to a soldier again , even POWs deserve better . '
One evaluator questioned whether the new MREs should actually be tested by non-military diners : ' Soldiers will eat all of this nastiness no matter what , because we have to eat . '
Not all reviews were negative , however , especially when it came to a chicken loaf MRE with a tasty dessert .
' The vanilla pudding is so good that I ripped it open .
Licked the inside and rolled around on top of it like a dog , ' one enthusiastic soldier noted .

Learning to Play Using Low - Complexity Rule - Based Policies : Illustrations through Ms. Pac - Man , a new paper published in the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research 30 details a very successful experiment in teaching an AI to play Ms Pac Man :
The researchers had agents play 50 games using different RL methods .
They found that methods utilizing the cross-entropy policies performed better than methods that were hand - crafted .
As they explained , the basic idea of cross-entropy is that it selects the most successful actions , and modifies the distribution of actions to become more peaked around these selected actions .
During the game , the AI agent must make decisions on which way to go , which are governed by ruled - based policies .
When the agent has to make a decision , she checks her rule list , starting with the rules with highest priority .
In Ms. Pac - Man , ghost avoidance has the highest priority because ghosts will eat her .
The next rule say that if there is an edible ghost on the board , then the agent should chase it , because eating ghosts results in the highest points .
One rule that the researchers found to be surprisingly effective was the rule that the agent should not turn back , if all directions are equally good .
This rule prevents Ms. Pac - Man from traveling over paths where the dots have already been eaten , resulting in no points .
This evening on " Hardball " MSNBC 's David Shuster started off the hour with a dead on debunking of President Bush 's rhetoric from his speech earlier today in which proclaimed that a U.S. pullout in Iraq would have the same consequences as our withdrawal from Viet Nam .
The president says that America 's departure sparked the Khmer Rouge 's murderous rule , but as Shuster points out , the killings started well before the U.S. pulled out and that it was a mistake to go into Cambodia in the first place as we only made the violence worse .
As for Bush 's claim that pulling out of South East Asia emboldened America 's enemies , Shuster had this to say :

Shuster : " ... But he was n't talking about our enemies at the time , including communists and the Soviet Union during the cold war .
Instead , President Bush spoke of Osama Bin Laden who mentioned Viet Nam a few years ago in declaring America would be weak in fighting al Qaeda .
... Bin Laden , however , is running al Qaeda from somewhere along the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan , not from inside Iraq .
John Amato :
It 's time MSNBC gives David his own show and have him guest host " Meet the Press . "
They can plug him in after Olbermann to capitalize on his ratings or have him replace the laughable -- no ratings -- Tucker Carlson .
Tweety 's show has problems too ...
One advantage that backers of Blu-ray have touted in the format battle with HD DVD is its extra helping of " unbreakable " DRM called BD +.
It 's not unbreakable after all .
SlySoft , makers of AnyDVD , have released a new beta of their AnyDVD HD disc ripping application that it claims can successfully crack and rip Blu-ray discs protected by BD +.
That did n't take long .
Just last week the company said that a crack was imminent , with full support for decrypting discs with BD + protection coming by the end of the year .
According to a SlySoft employee 's post in the company forums , the AnyDVD 6.1.9.6 beta has full support for playback of Blu-ray discs with BD +.
" All available BD + titles can be copied with AnyDVD ripper , or can be watched on HTPC without HDCP using PowerDVD 3104 and AnyDVD , " reads Tom 's post .
Finalized in June 2007 , BD + uses a small virtual machine that launches when a Blu-ray disc is inserted and runs in the background while the disc is playing in order to keep the disc 's content locked down .
If it finds evidence of tampering or copying , playback can be disabled .
The code is specific to each disc , which is intended to make it more difficult to crack , and is erased from memory once the disc is ejected .
The end result is an additional layer of protection in addition to the AACS encryption used by both Blu-ray and HD DVD , which was cracked back in April .
Unlike the cracking community that defeated AACS , SlySoft will keep its crack under tight wraps .
The company relies on sales of its products to fund its anti-DRM activities .
Releasing the code in the wild would allow other developers to benefit from SlySoft 's effort , something that they company says it can't afford .
The cracking of BD + is an indication that the VM that runs the BD + code has been successfully reverse - engineered by AnyDVD .
The Blu-ray Disc Association has not yet commented on the reported hack , but it can't be pleased that the extra layer of security it has touted as a key differentiator between it and HD DVD has apparently been compromised within months of its official launch .
This is n't game over by any means : the studios are bound and determined to lock down the precious HD content as tightly as possible .
But the news of BD +'s apparent defeat demonstrates that industry is going to have to devote significant time , money , and manpower to it as it attempts to stay ahead of hackers .
About three years ago a group of friends and I were out at the local Bowling Palace for some strikes and drinks .
Upon entering the bar , the bouncer grabbed my driver 's license and swiped it through a card - reader before returning it to me and allowing entry .
Three weeks later , I started recieving junk - mail from the Bowling Palace .
Fast - forward to a year later .
Again with a group of friends , entering a local restaurant for drinks and dining .
Inside , a pimply kid is taking IDs and swiping them through a similar reader that is generating paper receipts .
Below his chair is a pile of dozens of receipts .
I pick one up and observe it contains , among other things , the name and driver 's license number of the person being scanned .
When my turn comes to be scanned , I refuse .
The kid says everyone gets scanned , even my 36 - year - old self ( my friends say I do n't look a day over 40 ) .
I refuse again , as do several others in my party .
I allow him to carefully examine my ID but not to scan it .
He calls the manager .
I tell the manager I wo n't be scanned because of the 1 ) lack of security for my personal information ( reciepts everywhere ) and 2 ) I do n't consent to be entered into their database .
Manager says that the information is n't being recorded , the scanner is only for verification .
I ask her how she can prove that .
Manager says the information wo n't be used and I wo n't get mail .
I continue to protest , she verifies my ID manually and allows entry .
I follow this with a series of emails to the manager of the restaurant .
He tells me the state mandates the scanner and he has no choice in the matter .
I say , fine , I 'll take it up with them and ask him to provide me with the appropriate contact information .
He does not provide this information .
Research with the state is futile ( typical bureaucracy ) .
I observe that no other local restaurants or bars utilize these scanners .
Fast - forward again to this weekend .
Attending a popular restaurant festival in the same town , we connect via cell with a number of friends and agree to meet in the festival 's beer garden .
As you surely expect by now , entry was barred by bouncers ( of the same restaurant ) , wielding ID scanners attached to PDA's .
I refuse to have my ID scanned and am told that " everyone gets scanned . "
I ask him why .
I 'm clearly of age and am willing to have my ID examined by a nearby police officer .
He refuses , reiterating that " everyone gets scanned " .
Since my party is inside , I ask the officer if I can enter temporarily to get my wife .
He agrees .
Once inside , I schnooker the bracelet guy to get an entry bracelet and stay inside .
Everyone did not get scanned ( nor did another in my party who followed my lead ) .
Are we as a society now comfortable providing identification for electronic entry into a database that contains , at a minumum , name , address , and driver 's license numbers , for a transaction as simple as entry into a dining establishment ?
Are we willing to unwittingly " opt- in " to vendors ' marketing when compelled to do so under the presumption of verifying our age ?
Considering the cost of identity theft ( $ 56.6 b in 2006 ) , is the officers ' reaction justified or naive ?
Is this simply the beginning of the completion of the marketing circle where RFID tracks what you do , when you do it , how and with whom , and the messages that you receive all along the way ?
Have you " been scanned " and how was it positioned to you by staff — and was your visit followed by marketing materials ?
Or am I just paranoid ?
Should I be setting up an appointment for a tin -foil hat fitting ?
I imagine a world where I have complete control of how my identity is used , and I am appropriately compensated for its use .
I am fine with letting marketers track my behavior , tastes and preferences , but I want to be compensated for it .
I would happily be the " boy in the bubble " and have every purchase , TV show , radio program , mp3 , shopping trip , restaurant selection , web site visit , download , whatever , tracked .
But , I know there 's value to this and I want control .
Crazy or forward - thinking ?
James Wisdom updates :
Thanks for all the comments on this post .
After seeing the numerous suggestions to " use a strong magnet to erase the stripe " I did some looking online regarding this idea .
The consensus is that " common household magnets are not usually powerful enough " to wipe the ( black ) high coercivity stripe found on my ID ( and most licenses and credit cards today ) .
Some sources ( and commenters ) say the most reliable way to wipe the " HiCo " strip is by mechanically damaging the strip itself .
So , it appears I have an experiment on my hands — to discover :
1 . If a strong magnet bought online will wipe the strip , and if not ,
2 . What mechanical means could to be employed to do so .
But let me say that I find this technique of addressing the practice of unnecessarily swiping of identification to be marginal .
While it succeeds in the purpose of withholding my information , it fails in letting the vendor understand that there are good reasons why this practice should n't be happening in the first place .
Regardless of the results of this experiment , I will continue to object vociferously whenever I encounter this practice , and I appreciate your doing the same .
Thus , follow me now as I seek out a card - reader and strong magnet .
It turns out that card - readers can be had for about $ 50 on eBay .
I also discovered a number of intriguing " portable " card readers for sale .
One might wonder what sort of vendor would need a portable card reader that stores its password - protected information for later retrieval ?
That 's because the main purpose of these devices is for thieves to swipe your card and collect the data in the process of a regular business transaction .
EG waitress swipes card at her restaurant reader for dinner , then swipes the card through her own card reader for later enjoyment — a practice known as " skimming . "
For magnets , I purchased several " high energy Rare Earth Neodymium " magnets from Amazing Magnets ( which I had seen recommended on Instructables and elsewhere ) .
Once I receive my goodies a new update will be posted with my findings .
As a side - note , along the way I came across an Instructables article describing how to decode the barcode on your driver 's license .
Out of curiosity I did so and was pleased to see that the barcode of my driver 's license only contains the same information as is found on the front of the license ( not my SSN ) .
it 's a fun activity for paranoids and requires only a scanner , a photo editing program , and a computer .
The program in the article did n't work for mine but if you look in the comments another is linked that did the trick .
Dave Smith writes :
Scanning of IDs has been around for some time now .
When I left the industry a few years back , DL scanners were just coming of age .
Regardless of whether there is a mag stripe , the scanner will attempt to scan all the text , using OCR technology , as well as your picture .
An ID scanner will be loaded with a template from each state that will funnel the information into the proper database fields .
These scanners are huge time savers when issuing college IDs .
If you 've ever stood in line waiting to get a school ID ( 15 + years ago ) you know what I mean .
At first , the industry did n't get much resistance and people thought the technology was pretty neat .
Nowadays I 'd never let my ID knowingly be scanned , although there is some legitimacy to getting your ID scanned at a bar or drinking establishment though .
Bar owners today face a certain amount of liability if they serve alcohol to a minor , or a drunk patron .
Say the minor gets drunk , leaves and takes out a telephone pole on the way to the next bar .
He claims he showed ID and the bar served him alcohol .
The bar can now go back and check their scans and validate the claim .
Usually , even if somehow the ID fooled the scanner , the bar owner would n't be held accountable .
Or if the minor or patron was at Bar A , got smashed , left and got pulled over and told the police he was at Bar B or C .
The owners of B and C check their scans and find no records .
Bar owners B and C are cleared .
Some bars have only an age verification scanner that will record the scan , storing only the DL number , then flash a green or red light indicating a valid ID .
RFID is still too expensive for the masses but technology does exist that requires only that the card be on your person .
IDs are scanned by just walking through a scanner , as at WalMart .
More and more , though , because people feel violated by the ID scans , bar owners are installing high quality video surveillance systems .
A picture is worth 1000 words !

HBO strives to avoid bias charges in Florida 2000 docudrama Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday December 26 , 2007

Print This Email This Recount wants to avoid controversy that surrounded 9/11 miniseries
This spring , premium cable subscribers will be able to relive the drama of the contested 2000 presidential election when HBO debuts its new film Recount .
In creating the controversial docudrama , the network sought to allay concerns that beset some of its predecessors in fictionalizing real - world events by allowing the actual people portrayed in the movie to suggest script revisions and visit the film set , The Politico reports .
The most persistent warning being heeded by HBO comes from last year 's controversial ABC miniseries The Path to 9/11 .
That film , written by an avowed conservative activist , was widely criticized for its negative portrayal of former President Bill Clinton 's efforts against al Qaeda and the implication that members of his national security team allowed Osama bin Laden to slip away .
One of the writers credited on the ABC project , Peter Lance , told RAW STORY earlier this year that the miniseries ' producer " distorted " the findings of his book , 1,000 Years for Revenge , in producing the anti-Clinton assault .
" I was sickened , " Lance said .
In an effort to avoid similar controversy , Recount writer Danny Strong pored over several books , including Jeffrey Toobin 's Too Close to Call and Deadlock : The Inside Story of America 's Closet Election , written by the Washington Post 's political team , according to Politico .
Strong also personally interviewed the film 's main subjects , Democratic operative Ron Klain , Bush confidant James Baker III and Bush / Cheney attorney Ben Ginsberg .
Former Clinton officials Sandy Berger and Madeline Albright complained about their depiction in Path to 9/11 , and ABC was forced to add a disclaimer to the film and cut some scenes just before it was aired last year on the fifth anniversary of the terror attacks .
Producer Cyrus Nowrasteh , whose earlier credits include the Showtime movie The Day Reagan Was Shot , claimed earlier this year that the miniseries '
DVD release was being delayed because of meddling by Hillary Clinton , a claim her campaign denied .
Lance suggested the miniseries took his book 's reporting on the FBI 's failures and turned them into successes .
Furthermore , he said , Nowrasteh misled him on how his material would be used and then failed to properly compensate him .
HBO and the Recount producers are trying to avoid the same sort of problems by showing the scripts ' early drafts to players in the recount drama .
Some noted small problems with liberties taken in their portrayals , but there so far have been no major dust-ups of the type that affected Path to 9/11 , according to Politico .
" ' I 'm not sure it 's possible to boil down everything that happened in those 36 days into 120 minutes , but I know the people involved were trying to capture the chess match nature of the recount , ' GOP lawyer Ginsberg told Politico , reserving full judgement on the film until he sees the final product .
" If they achieve a bipartisan balance in telling the tale , it will be a fast - paced , entertaining and educational movie . "
Oh my gosh .
Those crazy New Yorkers – Democrats and Republicans , alike – had the audacity to insist that airlines provide food , water , clean toilets and fresh air when passengers are stuck in planes for extended periods of time .
The nerve !
The freeloading airline industry continues to lower the bar every year and now they are suing to maintain that right .
This from the same industry who gladly gobbled up $ 15 billion from taxpayers only to lavish executives with millions and cut workers salaries and benefits , sometimes even while in bankruptcy .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Elderly people with high blood pressure may be more likely to develop thinking and learning problems that can lead to dementia , researchers said on Monday .
Hypertension was linked to one of two types of mild cognitive impairment , a condition that can foreshadow the development of dementia , but not the type strongly associated with Alzheimer ’s disease , according to the study published in the journal Archives of Neurology .
People with mild cognitive impairment can have difficulties with language , memory , attention span or other mental functions significant enough to be noticeable to other people and to be detected in tests .
One type significantly affects memory , and the other does not .
The impairment is not enough to interfere with daily life and the person does not show other symptoms of dementia .
The elderly people with high blood pressure in this study often had a form of mild cognitive impairment that can be a precursor to vascular dementia , the second most common form of dementia after Alzheimer ’s disease .
It is often associated with stroke .
High blood pressure raises the risk for stroke .
“ It looks like hypertension leads to a cognitive impairment which is actually not really memory impairment but impairment in other cognitive domains , ” in particular , language and the ability to perform familiar tasks , Dr. Christiane Reitz of Columbia University Medical Center in New York , one of the researchers , said in a telephone interview .
The researchers tracked 918 people in New York , average age 76 , who did not have mild cognitive impairment when they entered the study from 1992 through 1994 .
EXAMS AND TESTS
They were given physical exams and cognitive tests when they entered the study , and then were reexamined about every 18 months .
They were followed for an average of 4 - 1/ 2 years , during which 334 of them developed mild cognitive impairment .
Those with high blood pressure had a 40 percent increased risk of developing mild cognitive impairment , and , more significantly , a 70 percent higher risk for the “ non-amnestic ” form that does not involve broader memory difficulties .
“ These findings suggest that prevention and treatment of hypertension may have an important impact in lowering the risk of cognitive impairment , ” the researchers wrote .
Previous research has been inconclusive about a link between high blood pressure and either mild cognitive impairment or dementia , they added .
Another study focusing on the health consequences of high blood pressure appeared in the journal Archives of Internal Medicine .
Those researchers tracked a nationally representative sample of 4,646 U.S. adults .
About three - fourths of those who had conditions such as coronary heart disease , stroke , diabetes or others that raise the risk for cardiovascular complications also had high blood pressure , the study found .
Karl Rove begins his racist smear campaign in the WSJ against Obama --- and is not even subtle about it .
He sends out the call to the right that this is where they will need to go to smear him .
Her remarks helped wash away the memory of her angry replies to attacks at the debate 's start .
His trash talking was an unattractive carryover from his days playing pickup basketball at Harvard , and capped a mediocre night .
What imagery does that conjure up for you ?
Oh , the days of playing some hoops with his posse and working on his slam dunk .
Then he takes it a step further with more race baiting tactics :
He is often lazy , given to misstatements and exaggerations and , when he does n't know the answer , too ready to try to bluff his way through .
Rove could n't help himself and had to bring in the " lazy effect " to describe Obama .
Do n't vote for him because he 's soooo " lazy " --- just like all minorities .
Did he say Obama had a " fence around his heart " somewhere in the op-ed ?
There is no point in trying to debate whether Obama is " lazy " or plays " basketball " because that 's what the right wants us to do .
They muddy the waters with endless canards knowing full well that the media will allow enormous amounts of time debating them instead of the issue at hand .
" Was Valerie Plame even a CIA undercover agent ? " is a typical example of this tactic by the right even after Gen .
Hayden , the head of the CIA declared her one .
And as we witnessed --- the talking heads gave valuable air time to rehash this nonsense instead of focusing on the real issue of the outing of an undercover CIA agent .
We use a phrase called " Dog whistle politics " to describe coded messaging :
" is a term used to describe a type of political campaigning or speechmaking using coded language , which appears to mean one thing to the general population but which has a different or more specific meaning for a targeted subgroup of the audience .
This op - ed by Karl Rove does n't even bother with coded messages because its blatant racism is so evident on the surface .
He 's telling his base to to pull out every racist stereotype you can find to attack Obama with --- use it early --- and use it often .

Experts say more needs to be done to promote Aids awareness
If the decision is made into law , Maharashtra would be the first state in the country to have such a scheme .
Officials attending the meeting said that compulsory testing was necessary in a state where HIV awareness is low .
But they say that the proposal will not be enforced until extensive public consultations have taken place .
The state of Andhra Pradesh announced similar plans in 2006 but they were abandoned .
India has one of the highest numbers of people with HIV in the world .
' High risk '
Supporting the use of compulsory Aids tests before marriage in Maharashtra , lawyer Jaya Nair of the state 's Law Graduates Association said the move was essential for a society where HIV prevalence is so high .
Some Indian politicians are actively encouraging HIV tests
The association has petitioned the Mumbai High court and Supreme Court over the issue , as well as making representations to the state parliament .
" We do not care what people do in their personal lives and this is not to intrude on their space , " said Ms Nair .
" However , there are an increasing number of cases where a person does not know , or deliberately hides , his or her HIV status and goes ahead with an arranged marriage .
" The spouse and the children are at high risk and bear the brunt of it all their lives . "
Another supporter of the proposal , radio broadcaster Pankaj Athawale , said that if it goes ahead the authorities will have to be on the alert for fraudulent certificates which might be used to cover up an individual 's HIV positive status .
' Not comfortable '
Opposition to this proposal comes from different quarters .
Guidelines laid down by the National Aids Control Organisation say that no - one should be forced to undergo a mandatory HIV test , and the results should not be used as preconditions for employment or providing healthcare .
The organisation argued that tests should be taken ahead of marriage only if both parties are in agreement .
" I do n't think it should be compulsory .
I am not comfortable with forcing people to do any kind of testing , " said human rights lawyer Siddharth Narrain .
Management executive Prajakta Bengali argued that such an idea has a long way to go before it becomes socially acceptable .
" Families go through several rounds of horoscopes and planet charts but they will not agree to HIV testing , " she said .
The proposals have not been universally well received
" And this is not about rural people or the poor .
Most of the educated urban people would have issues even talking about it .
Implementing this test would be near impossible . "
But at a community clinic in north Mumbai , frail Sarita [ not her real name ] - who has been HIV positive for the last five years - wishes she had been tested before getting married .
" My husband never told me , and died as an outcast Aids patient in a local hospital , " she said .
" Only after he was admitted was I told to go for tests , and the doctors discovered that I had contracted [ the illness ] too .
" Over the last few years I have lost family support and I cannot work like before .
I was cheated and the person who cheated me is dead .
I wish things had been different . "

At long last , Zombie Panic : Source for Half - Life 2 has been released !
For those who have been playing Zombie Panic for Half - Life 1 , must be very eager to play the Source version .
But of course , it is always possible you never heard of Zombie Panic before .
Thus , a small explanation of the modification :
The basic idea of the Zombie Panic is to create solid game play that is based on a classic zombie outbreak scenario , the living dead are coming for the last remaining humans , and these survivors must fight them off and live through the day .
Everyone joins a server , in the beginning you can either choose to join the human team or you can volunteer to be the first zombie .
If no one volunteers the game will pick one human randomly and the game begins .
The starter zombie 's goal is to , of course kill the humans while the human goal is to stay alive as long as possible , complete objectives , or even wipe out all the zombies .
The catch is that when a human is slayed he will simply join the ranks of the undead , now ready to finish off his old living teammates .
The humans can't tell by the player list who 's alive and who 's not , eventually there will only be one survivor still standing if all goes wrong , facing all the zombies which use to be allies , with his back to a wall .
The zombies only have a certain number of reinforcements ( lives ) , when a zombie is killed they lose 1 life from the counter .
However , when a human is killed they gain 1 life .
If the zombies only have 1 respawn left the humans can win the round by killing off the remaining undead left on the map .

WHY IS IRAN STILL IN THE CROSS - HAIRS ?
CLUES FROM THE PROJECT FOR A NEW AMERICAN CENTURY
In the latest escalation of tensions with Iran , on January 5 , 2008 five Iranian patrol boats surrounded three U.S. ships in the Strait of Hormuz , coming within a " threatening " 200 meters .
A voice with a thick accent then said in English , " I am coming at you – you will explode in a couple of minutes . "
The U.S. ships prepared to strike , when the patrol boats backed off .
That is how the Pentagon told it , but Iranians have questioned where the threatening voice came from , and Pentagon officials have admitted that they could not confirm that it came directly from the Iranian crews involved .
They have also admitted that the voice and the video film were recorded separately , adding to the mysterious circumstances .
1
Skeptical observers might think that the two countries were being goaded into World War III – either that , or that someone wanted to convince American viewers that Iran indeed remained a threat , despite a recent National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) finding that the country is not engaged in a nuclear weapons program as formerly alleged .
Before President George W. Bush left for his Middle East visit on January 8 , he told the Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot , " Part of the reason I 'm going to the Middle East is to make it abundantly clear to nations in that part of the world that we view Iran as a threat , and that the NIE in no way lessens that threat . "
2 Rep. Ron Paul ( R - TX ) said in a recent MSNBC news broadcast that there is still a " great possibility " of nuclear action against Iran .
The target has just shifted from nuclear power plants to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard , which has been declared a terrorist organization .
Paul said , " [ T ] here are still quite a few neoconservatives who want to go after Iran under these unbelievable conditions . "
3
The question is , why ?
One popular theory holds that the push for war is all about oil ; but many countries have oil , and we do n't normally invade them to get their assets .
Why go to war for Iran 's oil when we can just buy it ?
Another theory says that the saber - rattling is about defending the dollar .
Iran is threatening to open its own oil bourse , and it is already selling most of its oil in non-dollar currencies .
Iran has broken the petrodollar stranglehold imposed in the 1970s , when OPEC entered into an agreement with the United States to sell oil only in U.S. dollars .
4 But as William Engdahl pointed out in a March 2006 editorial , Iran is not alone in wanting to drop the dollar as its oil currency ; and war with Iran has been in the cards as part of the U.S. Greater Middle East strategy since the 1990s , long before it threatened to open its own oil bourse .
5
The Greater Middle East strategy . . .
Could the published plans for that program hold some clues ?
Iran was targeted in the infamous policy paper titled " Rebuilding America 's Defenses , " published by the Project for a New American Century ( PNAC ) in 2000 .
The document was patterned from an earlier blueprint called " A Clean Break : A New Strategy for Securing the Realm , " drafted for Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu in 1996 .
6
In a May 2005 summary of the PNAC directive , Professor Michel Chossudovsky described PNAC as a neo-conservative think tank linked to the Defense - Intelligence establishment , the Republican Party and the powerful Council on Foreign Relations ( CFR ) , which plays an important role in the formulation of U.S. foreign policy .
In " Rebuilding America 's Defenses , " PNAC called for " the direct imposition of U.S. ' forward bases ' throughout Central Asia and the Middle East , with a view to ensuring economic domination of the world , while strangling any potential ' rival ' or any viable alternative to America 's vision of a ' free market ' economy . "
7
Strangling any potential rival or viable alternative to America 's vision of a free market economy . . .
Could that be it ?
It is a matter of historical interest that the notion of a " free market " economy has n't always been " America 's vision . "
In the nineteenth century , " free trade " was something many Americans resisted .
They saw it as a British scheme to exploit America of its resources , at a time when British bankers had a corner on the gold that was the exclusive coin of international trade .
When the gold standard was abandoned in 1971 , the U.S. dollar became the world 's reserve currency in its stead .
Many disillusioned people in developing countries today suspect that America 's global " free market " is another form of exploitation -- prying countries open to be plundered of their physical and human resources in return for loans of the dollars necessary to buy oil at inflated prices .
Oil is the bait for ensnaring the world in the debt trap , and the terrorism that must be suppressed is the rebellion of any locals who will not be ensnared quietly .
The weapon in this economic war is debt , and the bullets are compound interest .
The story has been widely circulated that when Albert Einstein was asked what the most powerful force in the universe was , he replied , " compound interest . "
The story is probably apocryphal , but it underscores the force of the concept .
Compound interest has allowed a private global banking cartel to control most of the resources of the world .
The debt trap was set in 1974 , when OPEC was induced to trade its oil only in U.S. dollars .
The price of oil then suddenly quadrupled , and countries with insufficient dollars for their oil needs had to borrow them .
In 1980 , international interest rates shot up to 20 percent .
At 20 percent interest compounded annually , $ 100 doubles in under 4 years ; and in 20 years , it becomes a breathtaking $ 3,834 .
8
The impact on Third World debtors was devastating .
President Obasanjo of Nigeria complained in 2000 :
All that we had borrowed up to 1985 was around $ 5 billion , and we have paid about $ 16 billion ; yet we are still being told that we owe about $ 28 billion .
That $ 28 billion came about because of the injustice in the foreign creditors ' interest rates .
If you ask me what is the worst thing in the world , I will say it is compound interest .
9
Could the " viable economic alternative " that threatens the Western economic model be one that declares the collecting of interest to be illegal ?
That is the model Iran is now holding out to the world .
In 1979 , Iran was established as an " Islamic Republic , " designed to enforce the principles of the Koran not just morally or religiously but as a matter of state government policy .
Afghanistan , which is also in the cross-hairs of the U.S. war machine , and Pakistan , which the U.S. is trying hard to control , are also Islamic Republics .
The economic principles of the Koran include Sharia banking , which forbids " usury . "
In the Koran , usury is defined as charging not just excess interest but any interest .
That is also how the term was defined under Old English law until Protestant scholars redefined it in the seventeenth century , opening the Christian world to a form of economic advantage formerly available only to Jewish money lenders .
In Jewish scriptures , charging interest was forbidden between " brothers " but was allowed in dealings with " foreigners . "
( See , for example , Deuteronomy 23:19 , " You must not make your brother pay interest , " and 23:20 , " You may make a foreigner pay interest , but your brother you must not make pay interest . " )
This point is raised here not to indict the Jewish people ( who are not the " global bankers " ) but for its historical relevance in tracking the divergence of two religious systems .
Charging interest on loans has been accepted banking practice throughout the Judao - Christian world for so long that we do n't think there is anything wrong with it today , but that has n't always been true .
The history of interest is detailed in an article in The World Guide Encyclopedia , which is published in Uruguay and has a Third World / Islamic slant .
It states :
The practice of usury – lending money and accumulating interest on the loan – can be traced back 4,000 years .
But it has always been despised , condemned , restricted or banned by moral , ethical , legal or religious entities .
. . .
During the prophet Muhammad 's lifetime , criticism of usury became established .
This stance was reinforced by his teachings in the Qur'an , around 600 AD .
. . .
Judaism 's criticisms of usury are rooted in several passages of the Old Testament in which charging interest is scorned , discouraged and prohibited .
. . . [ I ]n Deuteronomy , [ the ban ] extends to all loans , excluding trade with foreigners .
The word " foreigner " is interpreted in general as " enemy " and , armed with this text , Jews employed usury as a weapon , as other people 's needs could be transformed into submission .
. . .
The prohibition of usury was adopted as a major campaign by the earliest Christian Church , following on from Jesus ' expulsion of the money - lenders from the temple .
. . .
[ T ]he Catholic Church of the 4th century AD banned the clergy from charging interest , a rule that was later extended in the 5th century to the laity .
. . .
[ A ] round 1620 , according to the theologian Ruston , " usury passed from being an offense against public morality , which a Christian government was expected to suppress , to being a matter of private conscience , and a new generation of Christian moralists redefined usury as excessive interest " .
. . .
[ I ]t is interesting to contrast the clear moral mandate expressed through Pope Leo XIII 's Rerum Novarum ( 634-644 AD ) about " ravenous usury " as " a demon condemned by the Church but practiced in a deceitful way by avaricious men , " with Pope John Paul II 's encyclical Solicitude Rei Socialis ( 1987 ) which omits any explicit mention of usury , except for a vague reference to recognizing the Third World debt crisis .
This " demon " governs current global relations , condemning most of the world population to living under the sign of debt : i.e. , each person born in Latin America owes already $ 1,600 in foreign debt ; each individual being conceived in Sub - Saharan Africa carries the burden of a $ 336 debt , for something that its ancestors have long ago paid - off .
In 1980 the Southern countries ' debt amounted to $ 567 billion ; since then , they have paid $ 3,450 billion in interest and write - offs , six times the original amount .
In spite of this , that debt had quadrupled by the year 2000 , reaching $ 2,070 billion .
10
Islamic scholars have been seeking to devise a global banking system that would serve as an alternative to the interest - based scheme that is in control of the world economy , and Iran has led the way in devising that model .
Iran was able to escape the debt trap that captured other developing countries because it had its own oil .
Few Islamic banks existed before Iran became an Islamic Republic in 1979 , but the concept is now spreading globally .
With the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989 , the viable economic model that threatens the global dominance of the Western banking clique may no longer be Communism .
It may be the specter of an Islamic banking system that would strip a private banking cartel of the compound interest scheme that is its most powerful economic weapon .
President Bush assured allies before his Mideast trip , " It 's important for the people in the region to know that while all options remain on the table , that I believe we can solve this problem diplomatically , and the way to do that is to continue to isolate Iran in the international community . "
11 Isolate Iran from whom ?
Isolation is something that is done to prevent contagion .
The contagion to be contained may be the creation of an Islamic State pursuing the principles of Sharia law , something that is now the rallying cry for many Muslims around the world .

A Kind of Exile
By Kevin Stoda
As some readers have noted recently , I have been using GOOGLE search as an indirect barometer to measure the buzz by which Americans and others around the globe are discussing the topic of impeachment for our infamous President George W. Bush and his mentor , Vice - President Richard Cheney .
Discussion on the web can take a variety of forms .
They can be educational .
They can be pro , con , neutral , or just for the sake of curiosity by a variety of writers on the web , i.e. those who are just in general interested in the topic of “ impeachment ”  .
On Monday July 23 , 2007 , I had reported rise of interest in the key words “ Bush ”  , “ Cheney ”  and “ Impeachment ”  of 300 more results in less than Â¾ of day .
( Original Article )
Well , if you watch the entire video of the interview Obama did with the Reno paper , or if you use you mouse to advance to the 20 minute mark , you 'll hear him say ; " The Republican approach ...
I think it has played itself out .
I think it 's fair to say the Republicans were the party of ideas for a pretty long chunk of time there , over the last ten to fifteen years .
In the sense that they were challenging conventional wisdom .
Now you 've heard it all before .
You look at the economic policies , when they 're being debated among the Presidential candidates and it's all tax cuts .
Well , you know , wwe 've done that , we tried it .
It 's not really going to solve our energy policies , for example ... "
Sure , I 'm sure he was just thinking out loud and he never actually said that he liked the Republican ideas , but the dude did say it .

USB 2.0 is way cooler then the previous version as it could run up to 480 Mbps .
However , that is going to be smashed through soon due to the release of the USB 3.0 standard .
This new standard will be capable of transfer speeds up to 4.8 Gbps which is a HUGE leap of 10 times .
The 3.0 specification should be with us early this year with products arriving in 2009 – 2010 .
USB 3.0 will be backwards compatible with 2.0 and 1.1 .
Also it will feature some more efficient protocols which will shut down to preserve power when not in use .
The cables will be parallel optical which allows for the higher speeds .
Bring it on !

Organisers of a topless motorbike parade in the New Zealand city of Christchurch hope to take their stunt to Australia .
The so - called Boobs on Bikes parade was held to promote an erotica expo and a group of about 20 motorcyclists - a mixture of men and women - took off their tops while they rode through the South Island city .
Organiser Steve Crow said Boobs on Bikes was an exercise in equal rights and was allowed after a test case he brought in 2005 that determined women could appear topless in public .

Dear Mr. President ,
Twice within the past few weeks you have spoken publicly about the advancing of the human spirit , once at a banquet here in Washington , and again , to ex-prisoners of Castro , in Miami .
Therefore , I invite your personal attention to last Friday 's raid , by U.S. Marshals , on a legally constituted church organization , The Founding Church of Scientology , at 1812 19th Street , N.W. , Washington 9 , D.C. , in violation of the United States Constitution .
The purpose was to seize an instrument used in our confessional , and religious literature .
Mr. President , would you greet with equanimity , a loud interruption , by public servants , sworn to uphold the Constitution , of your private confessions to your priest ?
It happened here .
Please help to restore the Constitutional guarantee of religious freedom by whatever means at your command .
Sincerely ,

Women have been thrown out of men ’s bathrooms , men who identify as women have been thrown out of women ’s bathrooms and , of course , men have been known to get into trouble in men ’s rooms .
But women minding their own business inside women ’s rooms have rarely been an issue , until now .
Yesterday , a New York woman filed suit against a West Village restaurant for being thrown out of a women ’s room there by a bouncer who , she said , did not care she was really female .
The woman , Khadijah Farmer , 28 , who lives in Hell ’s Kitchen , said in an interview that she was at the Caliente Cab Company restaurant on Seventh Avenue with her companion and a friend after the gay pride parade on June 24 when she left the table to go to the women ’s room .
While she was there , a male bouncer burst in .
“ He began pounding on the stall door saying someone had complained that there was a man inside the women ’s bathroom , that I had to leave the bathroom and the restaurant , ” Ms. Farmer said .
“ Inside the stall door , I could see him .
That horrified me , and it made me feel extremely uncomfortable .
I said to him , ‘ I ’m a female , and I ’m supposed to be in here . ’

And so , YBNBY provides a pictorial guide to the Ten best female streakers of all time .
( NSFW )
But while no - one - male or female - probably gives a damn about seeing male dangly bits jogging across a tennis court , I thought there might be a little more interest in a Hall of Fame for the great female streakers to grace our sporting arenas .
Streaking - a curiously British phenomenon ( that guy who streaked behind David Niven at the Oscars notwithstanding ) .
While I was growing up , it seemed that almost every national sporting event in England was interrupted by a naked runner - usually a short ugly hairy man who proved to the crowd just how cold the weather actually was ( see Seinfeld , shrinkage ) .
Erica Roe
24 year old Erica with an impressive 40 “ bosom was the grandmother of female streakers , having famously bared herself before the Queen of England at an England vs Australia match in 1982 .
Sheila Nichols
Sheila was aged only 19 when she invaded the hallowed turf of Lords Cricket ground in 1989 .
She is shown here breaking the two cardinal rules of female stripping - 1 ) trim well , and 2 ) never cartwheel .
Melissa Johnson
The first streaker to take to the grass at Wimbledon , during the Mens singles final in 1996 .
Balls dropped everywhere .
Tracy Seargant
Indoor bowls , a curiously British phenomenon which my own grandfather used to play religiously .
Quite what the old codgers thought of 22 year old waitress
Tracy is anyone 's guess .
This happened at the Indoor Bowls Championship in 2000 .
I believe in some circles the balls themselves are called ' Woods ” , so there 's definitely an erection joke in there somewhere .
Jacqui Salmond
The old saying goes “ Men seldom make passes at women who wear glasses ” .
Err , I 'm not sure that applies if that 's ALL they 're wearing .
Naked women and golf - to some men , I 'm guessing this equals nirvana .
( To quote Monty Python , “ Golf 's not too popular around here ” )
Michelle Cassidy
I would only consider topless to be a half - streak , but Michelle 's fine form deserves inclusion for her spirited jaunt on the Wembley turf during the 1995 Rugby League World Cup Final .
Suzanne Pegg
Suzanne is seen here wearing Varsity colours at an Oxford vs Cambridge Rugby match at Twickenham in 1997 .
Apparently Suzanne was a student at - wait for it - Tit Hall College .
Yep , sometimes the jokes just write themselves .
Michelle Newton
It 's not all young nymphs on the greens .
British Mom Michelle Newton streaked out onto a Sunderland soccer pitch to win a $ 100 bet .
However , as she was arrested and fined $ 200 for her trouble , it was n't exactly a financial success .
Naomi McDonald
A rare thing amongst female streakers ( unlike their more outgoing male counterparts ) , Naomi is a serial streaker , having pulled off naked runs at both International cricket matches and Wimbledon .
Lynsey Dawn Mckenzie
Lynsey 's sprint into streaking history happened during an England vs West Indies cricket match in 1995 .
She 's one of the few streakers to go on to make a living taking her clothes off , as a professional ' big boob “ model .
So fire up google and you 'll find plenty of shots .
My thanks goes to the Streakers Hall of Fame where you can find these and many more streakers featured .

Longtime Scientologist Nancy Cartwright — best known as the voice of Bart Simpson — last year gave the church $ 10 million to help spread the word of founder L. Ron Hubbard across the globe .
It was all part of Scientology ’s Global Salvage effort , which aims to “ de- aberrate ” Earth — meaning to rid mankind of psychological ills and other “ aberrant ” behavior .
Surprisingly , Nancy , 50 , forked over twice as much as the Scientology ’s most prominent member , Tom Cruise , who only gave $ 5 million in an installment plan .
Here are some of the celebrity gifts to Scientology from 2007 and their corresponding awards :
Nancy Cartwright , 50 , Patron Laureate Award : $ 10 million .
Kirstie Alley , 57 , Diamond Meritorious Award : $ 5 million .
John Travolta , 53 , Gold Meritorious Award : $ 1 million .
Kelly Preston , 45 , Gold Meritorious Award : $ 1 million .
Priscilla Presley , 62 , Patron Award : $ 50,000 .

What if he was anti-social , self - obsessed or - perish the thought - unattractive in the flesh , she thought .
Worse still , what if there was a mutual dislike between them ?
Fortunately for her , Joanna need n't have worried .
Within minutes of Steve arriving for their date , she found him to be charming , articulate and handsome .
But then he should be , given that Joanna was paying £ 350 for his company .
The 36 - year - old interior designer from Winchester , had chosen to " hire " Steve , a male escort , to accompany her to an important business ball that evening .
" I wanted to go the ball , but certainly not alone , " recalls Joanna , whose marriage to a chartered accountant - with whom she has two children - ended six years ago .
" As a successful single woman , I 've found social occasions difficult . "
It was a conversation with a group of girlfriends that prompted Joanna to choose this controversial solution to her social quandary .
" One of my friends had read something about high - flying women hiring male escorts to chaperone them to parties and business events .
We were all giggling about the idea of paying a beautiful man to grace your arm , but quietly I started to think it actually was n't a bad idea . "
Of course , the image most women will have of male escorts is probably inspired by Richard Gere as the highest - paid lover in Beverly Hills in American Gigolo .
And sure enough , when Joanna tentatively began to look online , she found scores of websites featuring men who were clearly using the term " male escort " as a smokescreen for prostitution .
Adamant she would never pay for sex , Joanna was about to give up when she happened on a website which advertised one of the few strictly non-sexual agencies - and which claimed its 1,000 or so female clients are predominantly successful career women aged 30 to 55 .
Joanna 's criteria for a male escort were simple enough : a man of similar age who would engage in intelligent conversation and social repartee while being convincing in his role as her " old friend " .
Sex was not on the agenda .
This was , Joanna insists , a business transaction between two professionals .
All well and good , but surely many observers would conclude it's a rather sorry state of affairs when an attractive , successful woman cannot find a decent man .
Joanna , naturally , does n't see it that way .
" Steve did n't disappoint in any respect , " she says .
" He was an intelligent , articulate professional who worked evenings as an escort as a means of meeting people .
We spent half an hour chatting in the bar so that we could get to know one another other and concoct a story about how we had met .
" At the ball , I introduced him to people as " my really good friend , Steve " and said we'd met years ago through work .
No one suspected a thing .
Steve chatted effortlessly with other guests while being very attentive to me , fetching drinks and asking if I was OK .
" When he led me to the dance floor , I could almost feel the envy emanate from other women as this handsome and sporty man twirled me around .
" At no time were Steve 's intentions towards me anything other than honourable , and at the end of the night we simply shook hands , said how lovely the evening had been , and that was it . "
In the three years since her first foray into male escorts , Joanna has hired them frequently , citing her children and career as the reasons she has little interest in conventional dating practices .
She says : " I can't be bothered with dating , as it's fraught with complications , and lots of men do n't like an Alpha female who concentrates as much on her business as I do .
" For the same reason , I can't be bothered with sex - I 'm not into one - night stands , but I do n't want lots of complicated strings attached to a relationship , so it 's easier to go without and hire men solely as companions . "
To this day , only her best friend knows quite how she manages to arrive at every social engagement with a perfect man on her arm .
Joanna is aware , however , that much as she is happy to pay for a man 's company , it 's not something she wants others to know about .
" Part of me wants to keep my male escorts a secret because of the seedy social stigma they 've got , and part of me thinks :
' To hell with it , let 's just tell everyone and get it out in the open . '
" But I 'm not sure I 'd ever walk into a business dinner or ball and say : ' Hello , this is so - and - so , I hired him ! ' "
Yet Joanna is far from unique in her penchant for disposable men - and in her lack of embarrassment that she cannot attract a man .
Cultural anthropologist Jean Smith is n't surprised by the trend for successful , well - paid women hiring male escorts .
" Men have done it for hundreds of years , and women are finally getting in on the act , " she suggests .
" The trend stems from women 's growing independence .
They 're increasingly successful in professional life , and they 're now taking control of their relationships , too .
" More of them are hiring chaperones who ensure they get all the benefits of male company without having to complicate it with sex and love , or rowing over who puts the rubbish out . "
Jennifer Hallam , 36 , is a management consultant with a transatlantic remit , which means numerous business trips .
Six weeks ago , inspired by a girlfriend who hires escorts , she paid £ 400 for the company of a man named James .
" I was in Newcastle on business for a few days , " she says .
" I 've never been to the city , did n't know anyone , and the prospect of watching TV in my hotel was depressing . "
Jennifer wasted little time in calling a local escort firm she found in Newcastle .
Its website states that sex with the escorts is forbidden .
" James sounded perfect - 30 years old , over 6ft tall , fit and educated , " Jennifer adds .
" I hired him to show me the sights of the city .
" I was nervous about hiring him , of course , but only because escorting has such a seedy stigma and I would never pay for sex .
That would be far too humiliating .
" But at the moment I really do n't have time in my life for complicated relationships with men .
Did I get a kick out of being with a gorgeous man ?
Of course I did .
It was a lovely way to spend what would have been an otherwise dull few hours . "
Young people today , even Christians , frequently told the survey that Christianity today is no longer what it was supposed to be .
They say it changed and changed for the worse .
And one result of this is a large increase in the numbers of people who are not Christians .
Simply put , each new generation has a larger share of people who are not Christians ( that is , atheists , agnostics , people associated with another faith , or those who have essentially no faith orientation ) .
The new book refers to this group as " outsiders " because they are describing what Christianity looks like from an outsider ’s perspective .
Among adults over the age of 40 , only about one - quarter qualify as outsiders , while among the 16 to 29 segment , two - fifths are outsiders .
This represents a significant migration away from the dominant role that Christianity has had in America .
Unusual Interpretations for Standard Controls
Most of these games are older titles .
Although there are a few more recent games that use a strange control method for the sake of challenging the player , these days they tend to be niche titles like Donkey Kong : King of Swing , which only uses shoulder buttons .
1. Dual Joystick ( Shooting )
Representative games : Robotron : 2084 , Inferno , Smash TV , Total Carnage ( Williams , arcade ) , Space Dungeon ( Taito America , arcade ) , Front Line ( Taito , arcade ) , Geometry Wars and sequels ( Bizarre Creations , Xbox 360 , DS and Wii )
Control description :
There are two joysticks on the control panel .
The left stick moves the player around , and the right one determines the direction of fire .
That means there is no fire button ; the act of pushing the right stick signifies intent to shoot , if the game does n't actually have automatic fire .
Adaptability :
Moderate to high .
Most controllers these days have two analog sticks .
Best of all , mind , would be two digital sticks , especially for Robotron .
The scheme in use :
In creating the dual joystick control style , Eugene Jarvis solved a problem with 2D run-and - gun shooting games that has since become so ingrained into the genre that it seems strange to think it was fixed so early .
Since Robotron : 2084 , there 's been Commando , Ikari Warriors , Gauntlet , Alien Syndrome , Zombies Ate My Neighbors , Gain Ground , Mercs , and Gauntlet Legends , along with scores more .
All of these games support player facing only because of the need to specify what direction shots will go , so in all of them , in order to shoot in a direction the player must first move in that direction , unless ( like Gauntlet ) , the player can't shoot while moving at all .
This might seem at first to be a control style for ambidextrous people , and there is a certain head pat / tummy rub aspect to it at first , but it 's not hard to get the hang of .
Most importantly , it makes the act of shooting at enemies while running from them much easier .
All of these games feature hordes of monsters following the player constantly .
In a game with the more common scheme , where the player must move the joystick to change facing , fire , then resume running , shooting behind always slows the player down .
Design lesson :
It is going against the grain of current design trends to recognize that all player ability is ultimately granted .
It is not always true that the player should be able to do everything he'd expect he could in real life .
For more modern games this must usually be explained , but for older , more abstract games this is not as important .
This said , I know of no game on the list of button - shooters above that gains much from forcing the player to jerk the joystick backwards to fire at approaching opponents , and some ( especially Commando ) would be greatly improved with Robotron controls .
2. Joystick and Dial
Representative game : Aztarac ( Centuri , arcade )
Control description :
The control panel contains a dial and an analog joystick .
Moving the joystick controls position .
A trigger on the joystick controls firing , a little unintuitively , since it 's the dial that aims the gun in any direction .
Adaptability :
Poor .
Attempts to map the dial to an analog stick could work , but would turn the control scheme into Robotron redux .
It 's a little more difficult to aim with a dial , but it could potentially allow for far more precise shooting than a joystick , digital or analog , could provide .
The scheme in use :
This one 's a bit obscure .
Aztarac is a very rare Centuri vector arcade game that Wikipedia tells us saw production in that fateful year , 1983 .
It 's got extra - sharp graphics for a vector game , and is a tremendous challenge to play .
KLOV states that only 500 machines were made , making playing Aztarac as its designer , the late Tim Stryker , intended nearly impossible for most people .
The player 's spaceship can fly freely in eight directions with the joystick , and can aim in many more directions using a dial to control aiming .
The object of the game is to roam around a huge area of space looking for enemy ships to destroy before they can fly in close enough to destroy a star base , destroying it .
Contact is all that 's required to destroy a base , and after the first couple of levels enemy ships begin flying in very rapidly and in ever - wider formations .
Although the player has infinite ships , losing all four bases means the end of the game , and before too long it becomes very challenging to get even one base through the attacks .
After three or four levels , enemy formations become so large that they wo n't entirely fit on the screen at once , forcing the player to both fly around to find the ships and use the dial to shoot them when they show up .
Unlike Robotron , which is more - or - less constant shooting , Aztarac has long periods of silence while the player either flies out to meet the aliens or waits for them to arrive .
When found , the player must take care of large groups of them very rapidly .
The act of " hosing them down " is fairly well - suited by the dial aiming control .
One thing Aztarac -- and for that matter Geometry Wars , which uses an analog stick to handle aiming -- have above Robotron is that the player can shoot freely in all directions .
Design lesson :
Aztarac does have a couple of problems with its control .
In addition to a stick and a dial there are two buttons : the fire button , which would be impossible to use effectively if it was n't on the joystick , and a radar button .
The game 's pace is fast enough later on that taking a hand off the dial and pressing the radar button can be fairly disruptive , especially since it does n't seem to pause the game while it 's held .

CNN aims to find out by opening an I - Report hub in Second Life , a three - dimensional virtual world created entirely by its residents .
There , CNN will look to those most familiar with the virtual world -- the Second Life residents themselves -- to determine what constitutes news " in-world . "
Developer Linden Labs opened Second Life to the public in 2003 .
According to its
Web site , Second Life is inhabited by millions of " residents " from around the globe .
However , traffic at any given time hovers around 40,000 users .
See the many views of Second Life . »
Just as CNN asks its real - life audience to submit I - Reports -- user - generated content submitted from cell phones , computers , cameras and other equipment for broadcast and online reports -- the network is encouraging residents of Second Life to share their own " SL I - Reports " about events occurring within the virtual world .
" The thing we most hope to gain by having a CNN presence in Second Life is to learn about virtual worlds and understand what news is most interesting and valuable to their residents , " said Susan Grant , executive vice president of CNN News Services .

" If Israel dares to make an adventurous move against Syria , it will pay a heavy price , " a member of Hizbulla 's political council warned Thursday .
In an interview with the Nazareth - based Kul al - Arab newspaper scheduled to be published on Friday , Dr Ahmad Malli warned Israel against considering an attack on Syria , saying that the Lebanese organization would respond to such an offensive with full force .
Tension IAF sends fighter jets to Israeli - Syrian border Hagai Einav Syrian aircraft detected flying over Syrian part of border .
After determining planes were not engaged in hostile activity , Israeli jets return to their base IAF sends fighter jets to Israeli - Syrian border
" Since 2006 we have begun a new stage in the Arab - Israeli conflict and have demonstrated this during the Israeli aggression in July ( the Second Lebanon War ) .
If anyone wants to make an adventurous move , it will baer responsibility for this aggression . "
Asked whether he was referring to aggression both against Lebanon and against Syria , Malli replied , " We are all in one Middle East . "
Ahmad Jibril , secretary - general of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine , also warned Thursday that if Israel attacked Syria or Hizbullah his organization would also respond .
In an interview with the al - Hadat newspaper , which is published in Arabic in the Galilee city of Tamra , Jibril warned that Israel planned to invade Syria in coordination with Arab countries .
The interview is scheduled to be published Friday .
According to Jibril , if such an attack takes place , Iran and Hizbullah will stand by Damascus and respond in full force .
" I believe that the Israelis and the Americans will carry out attacks against Syria as soon as possible , in other words in the near future .
I do not reject the possibility that the Israeli aircraft will attack us – the Palestinians in Syria .
" I also do not reject the possibility that they will attack the Palestinian headquarters in Damascus .
We , the Palestinians in Syria , will not stand idly by .
We will be at the front posts .
I also believe that Hizbullah will take part in this war , " he said .
Jibril added that Israel 's plan was to isolate Syria from Iran and the rest of its allies , after identifying it as the weakest link .
" I stress that the plan to isolate Syria will not go by easily , " he declared .
" I am certain that this war will last for months and will open doors which have not been opened in the past . "
We 've all had those days ( weeks " ¦ months " ¦ ) at work .
Nothing seems to go right .
Anything that can possibly go wrong does go wrong .
Stuff you did n't even know could go wrong goes wrong .
But before you throw in the towel , check out these tyrannical bosses and think to yourself , " At least I have n't been beheaded " ¦ yet " ¦ "
1. Faye & Ray Copeland
When I retire , I look forward to traveling , spending a lot of time volunteering at a no- kill animal shelter , writing " ¦ the usual stuff .
Faye and Ray Copeland , however , decided that when they retired they would become serial killers .
From 1986 to 1989 , the elderly couple hired workers to help them around their farm in Missouri .
After being tipped off by a former neighbor , police searched the farm and found five bodies buried .
Faye insisted she was innocent , but evidence against her included a list in her handwriting of farmhands hired " “ 12 of them had X's scrawled next to their names .
Of those 12 , five of them were found dead .
Police also found a cozy quilt inside the house made of the clothing of the men the Copelands had killed .
Ray and Faye were the oldest couple ever sentenced to death in the United States at the ages of 75 and 69 respectively .
2. Elizabeth BÃ¡thory
No matter how good the pay was at Elizabeth BÃ ¡thory 's castles , it was n't worth it : the Hungarian countess killed hundreds of girls and women , many who were employed as maids and servants on her property .
She did n't just kill her victims , oh no .
She tortured them first .
During her trials , it was discovered that the methods she used to kill included starving , freezing , beating , burning and biting .
Oddly , though , she was never sentenced to death .
Her accomplices were , but Elizabeth was merely bricked up inside of a room at her house for the rest of her life .
A small slit was left open so she could receive food .
She was put under house arrest at the end of 1610 ; she died in August of 1614 .
3. Rolandas Milinavicius
After reading this you might think twice about asking for a raise this year .
In July 2007 , a Georgia business owner shot and killed his only two employees when they asked for a little more compensation on their paychecks .
Rolandas Milinavicius told police that he was stressed out because the business was accruing a lot of debt and the talk about raises just pushed him over the edge .
I would assume that legal fees and not having an income at all due to being in prison would probably hamper his finances more than anything else he could have done .
I could be wrong though ; I 've never owned a business .
4. Henry Clay Frick
Back in 1892 , Henry Clay Frick was not a boss you wanted to cross .
Frick and his business partner Andrew Carnegie ended their working relationship when Frick reacted a little " ¦ rashly " ¦ to the Homestead Steel Strike .
In 1892 , a labor strike impacted the Homestead Works of the Carnegie Steel Company .
Frick was staunchly anti-union and thought he would thwart picketing workers by having Pinkerton agents access the grounds via the river .
When the agents got close enough , they fired into the crowd which was enough to start a full - blown riot .
By the time the chaos was broken up by the state militia , several men were killed and many were wounded .
Thanks , boss .
5. Henry VIII
It 's common knowledge that Henry VIII had no qualms with having people close to him killed " “ wives , employees , friends , contemporaries , whatever .
He had Sir Thomas More beheaded when More dared to disagree with King Henry 's religious ideas .
Prior to his death , More had served as Henry 's Lord Chancellor .
Another employee was the king 's minister , Thomas Cromwell .
He supported Henry when he was tired of Anne Boleyn and wanted to marry Jane Seymour .
Jane died soon after childbirth and Cromwell quickly urged Henry to marry Anne of Cleves .
The marriage was a disaster .
Cromwell divorced them , but being of no further used to Henry , he was sentenced to death for treason .
The young executioner hacked at Cromwell 's head three times before he finally succeeded in beheading him .
After that , Cromwell 's head was boiled and place on a spike on London Bridge .
6. Leona Helmsley
Obviously real estate mogul Leona Helmsley would have been pretty horrifying to work for " “ she was n't called the Queen of Mean for nothing .
Stories of her ruthlessness abound .
Lawyer Alan Dershowitz said he once had breakfast with Leona at one of the Helmsley hotels and the waiter brought him a cup of tea with a tiny bit of water spilled on the saucer .
Alan says Leona grabbed the cup from him and smashed it on the floor , then demanded that the waiter get down on his hands and knees and beg for his job .
Some stories claimed she would fire maids on the spot if she found so much as a crooked lampshade in a hotel room .
One maid , when working through lunch , snagged an apple from the kitchen to quell her hunger .
Of course , Leona fired her .
See , your job really is n't that bad .
Or is it ?
What are your bad boss horror stories ?
Dr. Mankiw , I have been a reader of your blog for the last few months .
Before that , I was a reader of your textbook and an ( undergraduate ) admirer of your work .
After graduating from the University of Texas with an economics degree last spring , I joined Teach for America and wound up teaching high school social studies in Baltimore .
At the end of last year , I was able to convince my principal to let me teach an economics course to second semester seniors this spring ....
I thought I would write to ask you the following question :
If you could teach every American teacher three economic concepts , what would they be ?
Thank you ,
[ name withheld ]
A new teacher of economics writes for some advice : I organized my principles text to put the most important concepts toward the front of the book .
If I had limited time to teach a basic course , I would try to get through the first 10 chapters ( out of 36 in the book ) , perhaps skipping chapter 2 on methodology and 5 on elasticity .
Summarizing these chapters in three big ideas is hard , but here goes : 1. Comparative advantage and the gains from trade .
2 . Supply , demand , and the efficiency of market equilibrium .
3 .
Market failure , such as externalities , and the role for government .
The lesson is that we can all gain from economic interdependence and that markets are a good , but not always perfect , way to coordinate people in an interdependent world .
Traveling is just about seeing and visiting new places and also giving back at the same time .
But we go more profoundly .
It is more than just giving and visiting places ....

Where has your Floating Point floated to ?

For those of you who think floating point computation is easy , I recommend as an antidote : Jean - Francois Colonna , The Subjectivity of Computers Communications of the ACM , v.36 , n.8 , August 1993 where he demonstrates the five ** algebraically equivalent ** formulae for computing x[ n ] = ( R+1 ) x [ n - 1 ] - Rx [ n - 1 ] ** 2 produce wildly different results even for fairly innocuous values of R and x [ 0 ] .
Canadian TeleSat Anik E - 2 Down ( A. Wexelblat , RISKS - 15.41 )
Colin Perkel < colin.perkel@guildnet.org >
The trouble began with Telesat 's Anik E - 1 going down .
This caused major problems for the Canadian Press news agency and its affiliate Broadcast News , as well as several other organizations .
One casualty was telephone service to the North .
After eight hours , Anik E - 1 was brought back on line but within minutes , Anik E - 2 , the country 's main broadcast satellite , also went on the fritz .
This knocked out TV transmission of several specialty channels , including CBC Newsworld ( 24 hour news service ) , to all areas where there are no fibre optics .
These channels were switched to other satellites and most services were restored in a couple of days .
Anik E - 2 cost about $ 350 million to send up , and is not insured .
Montreal - based Telesat says it is working on a possible rescue plan that could take months .
For the time being , the satellite is expensive space junk .
The coincidence of the two failures sparked all kinds of speculation : that either someone at Telesat screwed up big time , or a disgruntled grunt ( perhaps from sweeping layoffs recently ) sabotaged the bird .
There was also a suggestion Telesat engineers damaged E - 2 while trying to get E - 1 back in business .
These scenarios have all been denied .
The official line is that an unusually strong magnetic storm did the damage ( although other satellites nearby were not affected ) .

The Toronto Star , January 27 , 1994 , p.D2 .
OTTAWA ( Special [ Southam News ] ) —
Canada 's main broadcast satellite may resume operating within three months , the president of Telesat Canada says .
`` It is my firm belief we will restore service " , Larry Boisvert told reporters Tuesday at the company 's suburban Ottawa headquarters .
Technicians are trying to use the satellite 's 10 thrusters , normally used only to control major variations in position , to restore the fine aim needed to offer full service .
As of yesterday morning , Telesat had restored all service lost last week except for channels used by two broadcast channels and eight channels usd by Telesat 's telephone company owners .
The company is also unable to offer television news services live feeds for mobile crews .
The current troubles mean the company will again lose money in 1994 , Boisvert said .
Meanwhile , Telesat technicians say there is no way to repair the damage inflicted last Thursday on the $ 286 million satellite 's stabilization system by a space energy storm .
The technicians are , however , trying to devise a novel method of keeping the Anik E - 2's antennae pointed at earth , working with the device 's U.S. - based subcontractor .
The damaged satellite is not insured .

Re : Lightning on the Ethernet ( Eddy , RISKS - 15.41 )
Jon Peatfield < J.S.Peatfield@amtp.cam.ac.uk >
This is n't the story as it usually is told .
;-)
True the two maths departments ( applied maths and theoretical physics ( DAMTP ) and pure maths and mathematical statistics ( DPMMS ) ) are next door to each other , and that DAMTP was involved in this , but DPMMS was n't ( to the best of my knowledge . )
Nice rumour though , blame the pure maths dept .
When I joined DAMTP in September '91 it was the week following the largest thunderstorm in several years .
Sure enough many machines had got fried by the storm .
Mainly it was serial lines which had died , though a few other bits and pieces had also been zapped .
We did however see a large number of giant packet storms on one of our first floor segments afterwards .
A number of people were involved in the tracking down of the fault , as it did n't seem to be any of the machines on the network .
After a while the link going outside and over into manufacturing Engineering ( Eng - Div E ) , was found and it turned out that the fault was a PC at the far end of this wire which had lost all sense and was filling the net with garbage .
The network was terminated before the window in DAMTP and we were happy .
Later checks showed that this had been installed temporarily ( several years before ) as building work was expected to disrupt the area where fibre links were laid but had never actually happened .
We had the now much shorter segment on the first floor TDR'd and found it was over a 100 M over max length .
How long it was when it ran half way round Eng - Div E is unknown .
Much later when searching for a fault on the ground floor we found another cable going out of a window , and cut it back / terminated it .
Noone complained so we do n't know where it had gone in the past .
Before anyone points out just how bad our network is , let me say " WE KNOW " The ethernet in this building was installed by someone who did n't know what they were doing .
They worked for the UCS and we can't get funds to replace it .
We had no records of where cables go , nor their lengths .
As time passes we are replacing / rewiring sections piecemeal .
As I stare at the 2 30 M coils of coax on the wall behind my desk which stop my feet getting tangled in the ethernet I wonder how many other networks like this one there are .
All links between DAMTP and DPMMS are done with fibre , and always have been .
DAMTP and DPMMS are MAC level connected so there is / was no need for other links .
Indeed at the time of the incident DAMTP and DPMMS shared at least 2 machines ( though no longer . )
It is n't clear that unix - support had anything to do with this , other than they got told the story like everyone else who visits us .
The risks are obvious , never believe anything that unix - support tells you !

Re : Spontaneous recovery from " NOMAIL " setting
" Al Stangenberger " < forags@nature.berkeley.edu >
Something like this happened recently on ECOLOG - L ( sci.bio.ecology on Internet ) .
I forget the specifics , but basically a mailed - in submission somehow triggered a flood of duplicate messages being sent out .
In order to stop the replication the list owner set everybody 's status to NOMAIL but there was no record of which users were already in NOMAIL status thus there was no way to reverse the process once the error was fixed except by setting everybody back to MAIL status .
I do n't know if this was the listserver in question , but am cc-ing to the list owner who might be able to explain it more fully .

Spontaneous recovery from " NOMAIL " setting ?
Ron Ragsdale < R_RAGSDALE@oise.on.ca >
Setting " NOMAIL " to leave a LISTSERV keeps open the option of an easy return , but it may also lead to an unexpectedly full emailbox .
Early in January , I began receiving regular messages from a LIST that I had set to NOMAIL in 1991 ; the LIST owner told me I was set to NOMAIL , but messages only / stopped when I sent an UNSUBSCRIBE message .
Earlier this week ( JAN. 16 ) , I received my first update from RISKS in several years , under the same conditions , with my membership set to NOMAIL .
Today , I received 80 messages from a LIST I had left ( through NOMAIL ) about four years ago and quickly sent an UNSUBSCRIBE message ( which was acknowledged ) .
A student of mine has been doing research on a number of lists and a substantial fraction of the respondents tell about similar phenomena ?
Is the NOMAIL setting really a time bomb that may flood your mail directory unexpectedly ?
( I was fortunate in TELNETing from Berkeley today just as the avalanche had begun . )

Spontaneous recovery from " NOMAIL " setting ?

List Management is more art than science ... I know , I 'm a list - owner of multiple lists at multiple host locations .
As good as the Revised LISTSERV software is , the list owners , users , and sysadmins can and do make mistakes ( like the time I accidentally added another college president to a list that I maintained when I mistyped the userid ) .
One of the features of R - LISTSERV is for the owner to make changes to recipients ' options , using various wild - card techniques ... without asking for confirmation , or for what the options were before they were set .
Also , a user can be subscribed under multiple userids , yet only receive a single distribution .
Why ?
so that ( s ) he can post to a private distribution list from multiple sending addresses .

Re : Verify your backups
rob horn < horn%temerity@leia.polaroid.com >
We have a practice that once per week we select one file at random and request that it be restored from backup from the previous week .
It is amazing what you learn by doing this .
The range of things that fail , problems that arise from odd causes , automatic systems that mysteriously stop working , is incredible .
Even when all concerned know that this is the regular practice , things go wrong .
So everyone who is willing to put in the time and effort to make backups should also perform at least this rudimentary QC check .
Do n't ever stop .

Bad backups ( historical note )
Dick Hamlet < hamlet@cs.pdx.edu >
The note from managers of wuarchive .
wustl.edu about loss of archive files because backups were not usable reminds me of an experience with early DEC timesharing systems ( c. 1968 , 4 - series PDP - 10 operating system ) .
( Incidently , why do I so often get the feeling that problems solved in the 1960s will reappear forever , and that each succeeding group of systems programmers has less time / talent / interest for attacking them ? )
I was system programming director at Computer Center Corp. ( C^3 ) , a Seattle service bureau .
We used 1/ 2 " mag tape for backup of disk files .
Only after we lost the entire disk did we discover that our sole mag tape unit ( the cheapest we could buy , of course ! ) could not read all that it wrote , and that the dump / restore software ignored all tape errors !
( This was the same system in which the FORTRAN library disk i-o routine did retry for read failure , but did it on the NEXT disk block instead of the one that had failed .
It was remarkably successful -- the were NO permanent failures ever logged ! )
Our fix for the backup program was to write checksums on tape .
That way , we could check the tapes off line , and not slow the dump by doing a real file compare after the tape was written .
How many dump systems today read back what has been written for backup ( much less check it or do a file compare ! ) unless there is a restore request ?

CRYPTOGRAPHY : POLICY AND TECHNOLOGY TRENDS Lance J. Hoffman , Faraz A. Ali , Steven L. Heckler , Ann Huybrechts December 1 , 1993 CONTENTS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 1 . INTRODUCTION
2 . TECHNOLOGY 3 . MARKET ANALYSIS 4 . EXPORT CONTROLS 5 . PUBLIC POLICY ISSUES 5.1 EXECUTIVE BRANCH 5.2 CONGRESS 5.3 TRENDS 6 . POTENTIAL SCENARIOS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
During the past five years , encryption technology has become easily available to both individuals and businesses , affording them a level of security formerly available practically to only military , national security , and law enforcement agencies .
As a result , a debate within the United States about the proper balance between national security and personal freedom has been initiated .
Law enforcement and national security agencies would like to maintain tight control over civilian encryption technologies , while industry and individual and privacy rights advocates fight to expand their ability to distribute and use cryptographic products as they please .
This report analyzes trends in encryption technology , markets , export controls , and legislation .
It identifies five trends which will have a strong influence on cryptography policy in the United States : * The continued expansion of the Internet and the progressive miniaturization of cryptographic hardware combined with the increasing availability and use of strong cryptographic software means that the strongest encryption technologies will continue to become more easily obtainable everywhere in the years ahead .
* Additional growth in networked and wireless communication will fuel a strong demand for encryption hardware and software both domestically and abroad , causing the U. S. high - technology industry to be increasingly interested in selling encryption products overseas and in modifying current export restrictions .
*
Due to the responsibilities and bureaucratic dispositions of key Executive Branch agencies , products using strong encryption algorithms such as DES will continue to face at least some export restrictions , despite the widespread availability of strong encryption products overseas .
*
The American public is likely to become increasingly concerned about its privacy and about cryptographic policy as a result of the increased amount of personal information available online and the growing number of wireless and networked communications .
The development and increasingly widespread use of the National Information Infrastructure will heighten these concerns .
* Encryption policy is becoming an important public policy issue that will engage the attention of all branches of government .
Congress will become increasingly visible in this debate due to its power of agency oversight and its role in passing laws accommodating the United States ' rapid rate of technological change .
Agencies will remain very important since they have the implementing and , often , the planning responsibilities .
Since individuals and industry have more direct influence over Congress than over most other branches of government , Congress may place somewhat more emphasis on personal freedom than many other government actors .
Four potential scenarios are likely : mandatory escrowed encryption , voluntary escrowed encryption , complete decontrol of encryption , or domestic decontrol with strict export regulations .

At the GOP debate on Wednesday night , several candidates said then when it comes to gays in the military , they 'd rely on military leaders for advice .
" I 'm going to listen to the people who run the military , " Mitt Romney said .
Good idea .
Marking the 14th anniversary of legislation that allowed gay men and lesbians to serve in the military but only if they kept their orientation secret , 28 retired generals and admirals plan to release a letter on Friday urging Congress to repeal the law .
“ We respectfully urge Congress to repeal the ‘ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ’ policy , ” the letter says .
“ Those of us signing this letter have dedicated our lives to defending the rights of our citizens to believe whatever they wish . ”
The retired officers offer data showing that 65,000 gay men and lesbians now serve in the American armed forces and that there are more than one million gay veterans .
“ They have served our nation honorably , ” the letter states .
Gifted , Talented , Addicted
by Douglas Eby , Talent Development Resources
Writer Pearl Buck commented , " The truly creative mind in any field is no more than this : A human creature born abnormally , inhumanly sensitive . "
Winner of a Nobel Prize in Literature in 1938 , she also added , " By some strange , unknown , inward urgency they are not really alive unless they are creating . "
A number of people with exceptional abilities have used drugs and alcohol as self - medication to ease the pain of that sensitivity , or as a way to enhance thinking and creativity .
Sometimes they risk addiction .
Beethoven reportedly drank wine about as often as he wrote music , and was an alcoholic or at least a problem - drinker .
Among the many other artists who have used drugs , alcohol or other substances are Aldous Huxley , Samuel Taylor Coleridge , Edgar Allen Poe , Fyodor Dostoevsky , Allen Ginsberg , composers Beethoven and Modest Musorgski , F. Scott Fitzgerald , Raymond Chandler , Eugene O'Neill , Edna St. Vincent Millay , Dorothy Parker , William Faulkner , Ernest Hemingway , Thomas Wolfe , John Steinbeck , and Tennessee Williams .
At least five U.S. writers who won the Nobel Prize for Literature have been considered alcoholics .
Astronaut Edwin ' Buzz ' Aldrin said that he had been an alcoholic for several years before the Apollo 11 mission of 1969 , and had quit drinking only two days before the historic flight , but resumed after his return to Earth .
He became an active crusader against alcohol abuse .
Scientist Carl Sagan was reportedly a regular user of marijuana from the early 60's until his death in 1996 , using it on occasion to inspire some of his acclaimed scientific papers .
Richard Feynman ( 1918 - 1988 ; Nobel Prize in Physics , 1965 ) used marijuana and LSD while in his mid 50's , mostly while exploring consciousness in a sensory deprivation tank .
Naturopath Andrew Weil wrote in his book The Natural Mind ( 1971 ) about the advantages of " stoned thinking " in understanding health and diagnosing illnesses , and says he has tried about every drug in his book From Chocolate to Morphine .
While the National Institute on Drug Abuse says addiction to hallucinogens is almost unknown , some research they publish indicates that people who use or abuse one kind of drug are vulnerable to abusing other drugs , which may lead to addiction .
Actor Johnny
Depp admits getting drunk to deal with his sensitivity , and having to go to functions like press appearances : " I guess I was trying not to feel anything . "
He thinks drug use " has less to do with recreation and more to do with the fact that we need to escape from our brains .
We need to escape from everyday life .
It 's self - medication and that 's the problem . "
Writer and producer David Milch ( Hill Street Blues , NYPD Blue and Deadwood ) , when he was an undergrad at Yale , did " a lot of pharmacological research " as he has described his years - long addiction to heroin and alcohol .
Jane Piirto , Ph.D. , Director of Talent Development Education at Ashland University notes in her article " The Creative Process in Poets " that the " altered mental state brought about by substances has been thought to enhance creativity - to a certain extent .
But , she adds , " The danger of turning from creative messenger to addicted body is great , and many writers have succumbed , especially to the siren song of alcohol . "
She quotes poet Charles Baudelaire on using alcohol to enhance imagination : " Always be drunk .
That is all : it is the question .
You want to stop
Time crushing your shoulders , bending you double , so get drunk - militantly .
How ?
Use wine , poetry , or virtue , use your imagination .
Just get drunk "
an unconscious strategy
Addiction psychologist Marc F. Kern , Ph.D. , notes that altering one 's state of consciousness is normal and that a destructive habit or addiction is " mostly an unconscious strategy - which you started to develop at a naive , much earlier stage of life - to enjoy the feelings it brought on or to help cope with uncomfortable emotions or feelings .
It is simply an adaptation that has gone awry . "
Charles Baudelaire was an example of that .
He wrote in Artificial Paradises [ Les Paradis artificiels , 1860 ] : " You know that hashish always evokes magnificent constructions of light , glorious and splendid visions , cascades of liquid gold . "
But he led a debauched , violent , and ultimately tragic life , dying an opium addict in 1867 .
The cultural climate , the zeitgeist , can have a profound effect on how people think of addiction , and what substances they use or abuse .
As described in the article Addiction : a Myth of Modernity ? by William Pryor , Dr. John Stith Pemberton , a medical herbalist , developed in the late 1880s his " Pemberton 's French Wine Coca , which he copied from Vin Mariani , a blend of Bordeaux and coca .. [ which had testimonials from ]
Thomas Edison , Emile Zola , Queen Victoria and no fewer than three Popes .
" In 1885 the good citizens of [ Atlanta , Georgia ] adopted strict temperance legislation forcing Dr Pemberton to find a way of taking the alcohol out of his tonic .
" After much experimentation he concocted a syrup made from coca leaves , kola nut ( chewed in many West African cultures for its high caffeine content ) and damiana ( a mild psychoactive South American herb used to treat coughs , constipation and depression ) .
" The syrup was taken mixed with soda water .
He called it Coca Cola . "
Pryor notes that in that era , " The population as a whole held psychotropic substance use in a rather different way from the febrile and contradictory attitudes we hold today , despite a few well - chronicled exceptions like that of laudanum - crazed Coleridge .
" In the late 19th century the only mind - altering substance to be illegal , and that in small pockets , was alcohol .
The most - used medicines were opium and its derivative morphine . "
Dr. Pemberton died in 1888 at age 56 , from morphine addiction .
Pryor declares , " Addiction is a construct of modernity , one that knows no boundaries of class , circumstance or intellect , a mythic construct that seems to explain what is nigh on inexplicable , our strange response to the pain of being human . "
That pain can have multiple dimensions , including existential aspects , and be especially poignant for highly sensitive gifted and talented people .
Linda Kreger Silverman , Ph.D. , director of the Institute for the Study of Advanced Development and the Gifted Development Center in Denver , Colorado , notes in her article " Emotional Intensity " that intensity " is one of the personality concomitants of giftedness .
It is natural for the gifted to feel deeply and to experience a broad range of emotions . "
to dull sensitivity
Polish psychiatrist Kazimierz Dabrowski and psychologist Michael Piechowski have called this capacity for feeling " emotional overexcitability , " and found that five such areas of " excitability " are strongly correlated with high intelligence .
Bill Tillier , a scholar of Dabrowski's work , noted in the Dabrowski Discussion Group newsletter that the " use of intoxicating substances to dull sensitivity would be considered an unsatisfactory and low level solution in Dabrowski 's terms and would have to be seen as a negative disintegration ... a maladaptive response .
" Dabrowski would probably suggest that in the face of strong overexcitability one needs to relax and " weather the storm " without resorting to distortions of reality or the use of intoxicating substances . "
In their article " A Bioanthropological Overview of Addiction , " Doris F. Jonas , Ph.D. and A. David Jonas , M.D. consider that such a " nervous system so exquisitely adapted to perceiving the minutest changes in environmental signals clearly becomes overwhelmed and produces dysphoria when its carrier must exist among the exponentially increased social stimuli of a modern environment . "
Those with a less sensitive nervous systems are , they write , " better adapted to our more crowded living conditions .
The more sensitive can only attempt to ease their discomfort by blunting their perceptions with alcohol or depressive drugs or , alternatively , by using consciousness - altering drugs to transport their senses from the dysphoric world in which they live to private worlds of their own . "
In her article " Overexcitability and the gifted , " Sharon Lind says that people with emotional excitability â€œare acutely aware of their own feelings , of how they are growing and changing , and often carry on inner dialogs and practice self - judgment . "
If they also experience psychomotor excitability , when feeling emotionally tense , they may " act impulsively , misbehave and act out . "
Drug and alcohol abuse can be one form of this .
Heather King , a National Honor Society scholar , and a commentator for All Things Considered on NPR , says in an article of hers ( Quitting the Bar , Twice ) that she made a decision to go to law school because it would force her â€ œto study so hard I would naturally cut down on my drinking .
" Somewhere along the line I would be transformed from a person with a nervous system so sensitive that , when sober , merely being addressed by a fellow human being almost caused me to hyperventilate , into a bold , assertive , self - confident advocate for victims of racial oppression and gender discrimination . "
Her addiction grew from her need to deal with her " sense of alienation and deficiency , this intuition that I had missed some kind of essential truth available to everyone else ... it was the very reason I so ceaselessly craved the oblivion of alcohol .
" People sometimes ask me , How could you have gotten through law school drunk ?
My answer is that there is no way I could have gotten through law school if I had n't been drunk . "
A concept related to excitability is " CNS augmenters " who have central nervous systems which augment or enhance the impact of sensory input .
In his article Somatosensory Affectional Deprivation ( SAD ) Theory of Drug and Alcohol Use , James W. Prescott , Ph.D. cites studies indicating that being an " augmenter " is linked to substance abuse .
Stephanie S. Tolan , a well known author of young adult and children 's fiction , as well as an author and speaker on exceptionally gifted children , says in her article Discovering the gifted ex-child that gifted people " frequently take their own capacities for granted , believing that it is people with different abilities who are the really bright ones .
" Not understanding the source of their frustration or ways to alleviate it , they may opt to relieve the pain through the use of alcohol , drugs , food or other addictive substances or behaviors .
Or they may simply hunker down and live their lives in survival mode . "
A push toward addiction often starts at a young age .
In the book Gifted Grownups : The Mixed Blessings of Extraordinary Potential , Lisa , 14 , talks about being given Valium by a doctor : " Taking pills or smoking a joint helped get me through the day . "
She said gifted kids take drugs " To dull themselves ... there is so much of the wrong kind of stimulation going on around you . "
Acclaimed writer and memoirist Anne Lamott [ left ] has been very candid about her years of drug and alcohol abuse in her Salon.com column and elsewhere .
In a PBS profile , she commented about starting in eighth grade : " You 're completely hormonally challenged up the ying - yang and on top of all these feelings they make you go to dances .
I stood around , and no one asked me to dance , and then I had like a beer and a half .
And boys asked me to dance and I was home free .
" I think things started to work for me a little bit better when I started to take drugs and to drink alcoholically .
I started to drink pretty regularly by the time I was 13 .
I got very drunk on a nightly basis from the time I was about 19 ' til 32 . "
She now finds being sober a " grace " supported by her Christian faith .
Psychiatrist Leon Wurmser , M.D. comments in his article Drug Use as a Protective System that anxiety " of an overwhelming nature and the emotional feelings of pain , injury , woundedness , and vulnerability appear to be a feature common to all types of compulsive drug use . "
In her memoir Looking for Gatsby : My Life , actor Faye Dunaway admits eating compulsively " to counter the stress of filmmaking .
I 've never stopped guarding against a return to that kind of emotional reliance on food , and as I grew into this sophisticated world , alcohol .
I 'm finally beyond that now , but it was the pendulum I would swing on for years . "
Many gifted people are also susceptible to mental health issues such as mood disorders , and may self - medicate .
Writer and actor Carrie Fisher at times took 30 Percodan a day , and said in an article , " Drugs made me feel more normal .
They contained me . "
At age 28 she overdosed , and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder .
" Maybe I was taking drugs to keep the monster in the box , " she said .
The use of substances , and the attitudes about that use or abuse , are very much tied to the social climate of the times .
Researcher Stanton Peele , J.D. , Ph.D. notes that although definitions of addiction are " putatively rational and scientific , they are actually historical and political .. not based on pharmacological criteria , but in order to create a basis for disapproving of and proscribing drugs . "
One arena in which drugs are often prescribed is for the treatment of learning disorders such as ADD / ADHD .
A report titled Substance Abuse and Learning Disabilities : Peas in a Pod or Apples and Oranges ?
says there is an addiction or abuse risk with these disorders : " ADHD affected individuals have a high incidence of substance abuse , and ADHD is further associated with an earlier onset of substance abuse and a greater difficulty shaking addiction .
" Studies show that as many as half of those suffering ADHD self - medicate with drugs and alcohol .
An individual with ADHD is twice as likely as one without ADHD to abuse substances . "
Addiction may be a convenient term , but the concept is not simple , and there can be a wide spectrum of behaviors and qualities of relationship with various substances .
Studies have reported that individuals exposed to stress are more likely to abuse alcohol and other drugs .
But there are , of course , healthier strategies to manage stress .
One of the crucial questions is how much does use of a substance or engaging in a behavior help us cope , versus limit the expression of our unique selves and talents .
Dealing with addiction can be not only life - saving , but releasing .
As musician Elton John has commented , " A lot of good things have happened to me , and it 's all because of sobriety .
I went into treatment [ for drug and alcohol addiction ] , and I emerged with my eyes open . "

The tagline for home improvement superstore Lowe 's may be " Let 's Build Something Together , " but that " something " sure is n't good PR when it comes to dealing with public criticism online .
One angry customer was so dissatisfied with Lowe 's work and customer service that he was spurred into putting up a web site called Lowes - Sucks.com in order to air his grievances .
Lowe 's was unhappy with this public display of dissatisfaction and took a " creative " approach to getting him to take it down — accusations of trademark infringement .
After a bit of back and forth , Lowe 's has relented by making an offer to settle out of court , but has suddenly fallen silent upon the customer 's counteroffer .
Let 's back up a little bit .
Lowe 's customer and Ars Technica reader , Allen Harkleroad , had a fence installed at his home by a Lowe 's " professional . "
Upon further inspection , however , Harkleroad discovered that the $ 3,500 job came complete with what he considered to be shoddy workmanship .
Fence posts were loose , parts became easily disjointed , and the gate door did not fully close , among other things .
Harkleroad said that his dogs were able to escape several times , and that when he complained to customer service , he was told that the installer would need to come back out to fix the fence .
When he called the installer , he said that Lowe 's had to tell him to go fix the fence .
Harkleroad decided that he would refuse to pay the remainder of his balance until the situation was fixed , but Lowe 's was having none of that .
The billing department told him that it was n't their problem and proceeded to turn Harkleroad 's account over to collections .
It was at this point that Lowes - Sucks.com was born , but Lowe 's was having none of that either .
Last week , Harkleroad received a cease - and - desist letter from the company , accusing him of unauthorized use of the company 's intellectual property on his site .
" Your use of the Lowe 's Marks and your registration of www.Lowes-sucks.com is unauthorized by LF , distorts the goodwill of LF 's federally - registered trademarks , and constitutes infringement of LF 's trademark rights , " reads the letter signed by Lowe 's trademark manager Rebecca Green .
Part of the problem with this accusation is that Harkleroad 's site contains absolutely no logos , graphics , or other " marks " from Lowe's , and otherwise would not be identifiable as being related to Lowe 's at all except for the name in the URL and the content of the site itself ( which is unlikely to be mistaken for the company 's official web site ) .
Harkleroad also points out that the infringement notice failed to identify the alleged trademark infringements , and fails to recognize that the site is a parody .
" I also might remind you that USC 15 1125 ( a ) is in correct [ sic ] in regards to your claim of infringement , you need to come up with something better than that .
Better go grab that US
Code book you are referring from and find something that you believe matches more closely , " wrote Harkleroad in response to the letter .
At that point , the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) hopped on Harkleroad 's side to provide legal counsel and help defend him against what he claims were abuses of the law in an attempt to bully him — the story was also picked up by a number of online news outlets .
Suddenly , Lowe 's attorneys made Harkleroad an offer on Monday to settle the issue out - of - court , which Harkleroad discussed optimistically on his site .
" My thanks to Lowe 's for allowing us to ( possibly ) come to a mutually acceptable agreement for both parties , that is of course if this all gets finalized as I do believe it will .
If it does this will be the last post or comment I make about the issue on this web site , " he wrote .
But that 's apparently where the story has ground to a halt once again .
Harkleroad tells
Ars that he and his attorney made a counteroffer to the settlement , and have since not heard back .
" I think they are thinking that for the most part the issue is over , " he told us .
He has declined to comment on the details of the offer and counteroffer , but Harkleroad says that he has not heard any word back for several days .
Harkelroad 's attorney , EFF staff attorney Corynne McSherry , acknowledged that the two parties are in discussions about a settlement , but declined to provide details as the " discussions are confidential . "
She did , however , point out that the courts have been clear that " gripe sites like this are protected — in fact , they want people to speak freely and share information about their experiences with various companies . "
She said that trademark holders sometimes lose sight of the point of trademark law , which is to protect consumers and provide them with good information about a company 's product .
Sites like Lowes - Sucks.com provide information on someone 's consumer experience , she said , which is not only allowed under trademark law , but protected by the First Amendment .
" There is no legal question here that they do n't have a trademark claim , " McSherry told Ars .
This is n't the first time companies have attempted to use some arbitrary aspects of intellectual property law to silence public criticism online .
Universal Music Group sent DMCA takedown notices to YouTube over a highly critical video of rapper Akon was posted by Michelle Malkin — eventually the EFF got involved and the clip was restored to YouTube .
The EFF also filed a lawsuit against " paranormalist " Uri Geller for sending DMCA takedown notices over videos that were not created by him , but by another company that had created a documentary that was critical of his work and posted it to YouTube .
So what is the lesson to be learned in all of this ?
While Harkleroad 's case with Lowe's is not quite over , it appears as if the company is backing off of its trademark infringement claims ( Harkleroad notes on his web site that the issue of officially retracting the claim is still being worked out between the attorneys ) .
But the attempt to even make such a claim is still troubling , given the Internet 's availability as a public soap box , where nearly anyone with grievances to air is allowed to do so .
In another case where Viacom " mistakenly " misused the DMCA to have a parody taken down , the company agreed as part of its settlement with the EFF to educate its reviewers about fair use and promised not to challenge the use of its content if it is " creative , newsworthy , or transformative . "
The EFF is n't exactly known for backing down over cases like this , so we look forward to hearing about whatever resolution may come out of the Lowe 's case .
Harkleroad told us that if the two are unable to come to a resolution , he is still willing to take the case to court in Georgia .
France at a Standstill Five Million Civil Servants Join Strikes
It 's Black Tuesday for French President Nicolas Sarkozy .
Five million French civil servants have gone out on strike , joining millions of others already on the streets protesting planned reforms .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Real estate investor Matthew Martinez is the point man for a private equity group that plans to invest $ 200 million in Florida condo developments .
But recent forecasts show many housing markets in the Sunshine State are looking at double - digit drops in home prices .
What is he thinking ?
" The smart money is thinking about buying there right now , " says Martinez .
" It may be six to 12 months early , but it 's a good time to be searching for deals . "
Local housing markets that have fallen far , yet have the potential to recover soon , are ripe targets for " vulture investors , " who buy cheap in the hope that prices will rebound .
One area suffering from steep declines is the Miami / Ft. Lauderdale / Palm Beach region , where prices are expected to drop as much as 12 percent .
The correction comes after years of intense real estate speculation .
" We believe in the long - term viability of the Florida real estate market , but we 're buying on rental economics , " Martinez says .
" People had been purchasing on condo economics and those numbers no longer apply . "
He 's looking for 15 percent or higher discounts off previous condo prices to make his purchases viable .
He then plans to convert the apartments back into rental units .
For vulture investors , it 's not only about the discounts .
In order to hold a real estate asset for the several years it might take to turn around , properties have to generate ample cash flow while they wait .
The mortgage meltdown mess and stagnating housing markets have reduced home ownership , according to the Census Bureau , adding to the number of the nation 's renters .
As a result , demand for rental housing has grown .
Marcus & Millichap Real Estate Brokerage projects average rents nationwide will jump 14 percent for the three years ending this coming December .
Rents in Florida have jumped .
Orlando is expected to finish up 21.2 percent for the three years , Ft. Lauderdale 20.5 percent and West Palm Beach 18.6 percent .
The rent increases should provide a price - safety net , especially for condos , since investors will buy as the spreads between rents and mortgage payments diminish .
Today the nationwide median mortgage payment of $ 1,566 is still 80 percent higher than the median monthly rent of $ 943 , but that 's down from a couple of years ago , when the difference was close to 100 percent .
When markets were extremely hot , the investor mind - set was very different than it is today , according to Danielle Babb , who owns properties in the Southwest .
" They were looking for flips , now they 're looking to buy and hold , " she says .
According to Babb , more investors are eyeing various markets but are being extremely cautious .
" They 're concerned that the market has not yet hit bottom . "
Investors will look to buy in areas where home prices are reasonably low and rents reasonably high , according to Babb , with an eye for the long haul .
" What we 've got is a market that has reverted to what it was like six years ago .
People no longer look at their houses like lottery wins , " says Jim Gillespie , chief executive of real estate brokerage , Coldwell Banker .
But according to Jonas Lee , of Redbrick Partners , a private equity firm that invests in real estate , sellers are reluctant to slash prices .
If owners want to sell quickly , within 90 days , they may have to come down about 15 percent , he says .
Lee is also interested in Florida , and the Boston and D.C. areas as well .
Some of the down markets he's not considering include the Central Valley cities of California , where prices in places like Stockton soared for several years .
Moody 's projects prices there will fall 25 percent .
Lee does n't like Stockton 's prospects because , " It was so overpriced there and there are few constraints on building . "
If prices start to recover , developers can quickly build again , putting a damper on price growth .
" Investors will look to areas with job growth and low unemployment , especially in smaller communities where there has n't been big price appreciation and rents have n't gone down , " according to Gillespie .
" In those places , the return is much greater . "
Usually , Muslim groups like the Organization of the Islamic Conference are quick to defend any affront to the image of Islam .
The organization , which represents 57 Muslim states , sent four ambassadors to the leader of my political party in the Netherlands asking him to expel me from Parliament after I gave a newspaper interview in 2003 noting that by Western standards some of the Prophet Muhammad ’s behavior would be unconscionable .
A few years later , Muslim ambassadors to Denmark protested the cartoons of Muhammad and demanded that their perpetrators be prosecuted .
But while the incidents in Saudi Arabia , Sudan and India have done more to damage the image of Islamic justice than a dozen cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad , the organizations that lined up to protest the hideous Danish offense to Islam are quiet now .
I wish there were more Islamic moderates .
For example , I would welcome some guidance from that famous Muslim theologian of moderation , Tariq Ramadan .
But when there is true suffering , real cruelty in the name of Islam , we hear , first , denial from all these organizations that are so concerned about Islam ’s image .
We hear that violence is not in the Koran , that Islam means peace , that this is a hijacking by extremists and a smear campaign and so on .
But the evidence mounts up .
Islamic justice is a proud institution , one to which more than a billion people subscribe , at least in theory , and in the heart of the Islamic world it is the law of the land .
But take a look at the verse above : more compelling even than the order to flog adulterers is the command that the believer show no compassion .
It is this order to choose Allah above his sense of conscience and compassion that imprisons the Muslim in a mindset that is archaic and extreme .
If moderate Muslims believe there should be no compassion shown to the girl from Qatif , then what exactly makes them so moderate ?
When a “ moderate ” Muslim ’s sense of compassion and conscience collides with matters prescribed by Allah , he should choose compassion .
Unless that happens much more widely , a moderate Islam will remain wishful thinking .

Why the Claim that Progressive Secular Values and Policies Are Bad For Societies is a Great Big Lie
The propaganda industry that is the social and religious right never ceases in its campaign to perpetuate a myth .
It is the all critical cutting edge of a long standing wedge strategy that cannot fail if anti-progressive traditionalism is to retain its legitimacy .
The myth is that societies that adopt progressive secular values are doomed to societal collapse and chaos .
Among its prominent proponents is “ Culture Warrior ” Bill O’Reilly who has announced that social traditionalists must battle the forces of progressive humanism to save the nation as part of the Culture War proclaimed by Pat Buchanon .
Still more virulent – even O’Reilly sometimes objects to her tactics – is Ann Coulter who blames just about everything that has gone wrong from murder to abortion to Nazism on secularism and its common consort , evolutionary science .
Ken Ham ’s new and very popular Answers in Genesis Creation Museum outside Cincinnati -- after teaching its visitors that the Earth was formed a couple of thousand years before the Pyramids , and that The Flintstones were correct in showing humans riding dinosaurs -- agrees with Coulter on the dire dangers of secularism and Darwinism .
The more genteel Discovery Institute , which favors Intelligent Design creationism without the Biblical wackiness , also wishes to counter “ materialism ’s destructive cultural consequences . ”
Although the Catholic Church has no particular problem with evolutionary theory , Benedict contends that a secular society is a “ dictatorship of relativism ” that invariably leads to a “ culture of death . ”
The notion that traditional religious values are what makes America great is summarized in one of Reagan ’s favorite dictums , that the nation is a “ Shining City on the Hill ” that stands as an outstanding example to the rest of the world .
Religious forces have succeeded in whipping popular opinion those who do not agree with customary views of faith and creation into outright societal fear factors .
The wing of the secular community that has taken the biggest hit are the atheists , which studies show most Americans do n’t want to marry , or become president .
If the claims being made by the religious right are not correct , then they are slanderous lies .
There is something funny about the premise that progressive secularism promotes societal dysfunction .
North of the border is a nation that is much more secular and progressive than ours , Canada .
Same across the pond in western Europe .
Two thirds of the French do not believe in a supreme being , and even more do not in Scandinavia .
In all western nations solid majorities , up to 80 % , accept human descent from animals , except for America where only half do so .
Of the 19 most prosperous democracies , 18 are markedly less religious and more socio-economically progressive than America .
This divergence acts as an enormous social experiment of some 800 million persons that can be used to test and compare the success of different systems .
What is funny is that the news from the lands of secular progressivism is , on the main , pretty good .
If failure to adhere to traditional religious values leads to murder and mayhem , then why has it not done so in Canada , France , Sweden et al ?
Why are n’t the right wing think tanks churning out study after study showing that the secularized democracies are suffering from plaques of social ills , problems that do not afflict the comparatively traditional and conservative USA ?
The reason is that they can’t .
From what I hear , progressive Danes are not having sex in the streets , and when lethal violence occurs there it is likely to involve religious - political passions .
As time went by I got tired of how the socio- religious right was bashing secular societies while it was obvious that their charges were at best questionable .
I also was frustrated that no one seemed to be doing the sociological science needed to determine the true situation .
One thing led to another and I ended up conducting the first technical study on the subject and published it in The Journal of Religion and Society .
Here is what I have found .
All of the secular progressive democracies , and only the secular progressive democracies , are enjoying remarkably low rates of homicide , incarceration and childhood mortality , long lifespans , moderate abortion levels , as well as low rates of STD infection , and teen pregnancy .
In comparison , the more socially , religiously , politically and economically conservative USA is over all # 1 in terms of societal dysfunction , often suffering social ills at extreme levels compared to the rest of the west .
Murder rates are many multiples higher in American than in any other 1st world nation .
Crime - ridden cities like Detroit , Baltimore , DC , Atlanta , and New Orleans are not found in the other advanced nations .
No other country in the world , even huge China , has so many people in prison as does the USA , an amazing 2 million .
Most of them are Christians and Muslims , atheists and agnostics are rather scarce .
This country has half a dozen times more inmates per capita than the western norm .
In some other prosperous democracies mortality in infants and young children is half that seen here .
Only the Irish and Danes do not live longer than Americans .
Levels of teen gonorrhea infection are dozens to literally hundreds of times higher in the USA than in Europe and Canada .
Gonorrhea and syphilis have been nearly exterminated in the Nordic countries .
The Papacy claims that “ the proabortion culture is especially strong precisely where the Church ’s teaching on contraception is rejected . ”
Actually , abortion rates are very high in nations where it is illegal , and are about a third higher in America than in the other advanced democracies .
Pregnancy rates among teens that are not married are two to dozens of times lower in secularized democracies than in the USA .
The only nation that edges out ours in high levels of divorce is Sweden .
One reason America has such high levels of divorce is because evangelical born agains are notoriously prone to splitting up .
Likewise , levels of other social dysfunction from murder to STDs to unwed pregnancies tend to be higher in those parts of the states that are the most conservative Protestant .
As with all things the situation is not entirely one sided .
The USA does not score worse than average in terms of suicide ( although the tendency of Scandinavians to kill themselves is exaggerated ) .
Levels of nonlethal crime appear to be substantial in many secular democracies , and in some places may match American rates .
Americans have a high rate of marriage and fertility , although whether the latter is an advantage in an age of overpopulation is open to question .
Interestingly the highly secular French reproduce nearly as fast as Americans , and the most Catholic democracies are the least fertile .
But the USA is performing so dreadfully badly in so many ways that the positives cannot overcome the negatives .

I did n’t make any of these up .
Each of these powers came from actual heroes or villains from comic books and / or cartoons .

1. Stretching –
And the strangest thing about this one ?
Quite a few superheroes from comics have this ability : Mr. Fantastic , Elongated Man , Plastic Man , Skin , etc .
2. Ability to transform into any form of water – Zan is definitely the lesser of the two Wonder Twins .
His sister can become any animal .
Zan ?
He can become water , ice , or steam .
Yipee .
3. Ability to control plants and accelerate their growth – A few superheroes / villains have this one .
If you ’re a vegetarian , this might be useful , having an unlimited supply of food .
Otherwise ?
Pretty useless in any urban area .
4. Shrinking – Quite a few superheroes have this ability too .

6 . Good morals and harmonic “ niceness vibes ” – Created to be the antithesis of the villain Lobo , Goldstar has the powers of… a boyscout .
7. Neutralizing other people ’s powers – Leech and Elmo pretty much just suck away other mutants ’ powers .

10 .
A pariah effect that enables one to overwhelmingly compel people to run towards or away from specific target that is focused on – Tag gets the award for most randomly useless power .
11 . Extend razor sharp spikes of bone through one ’s skin – Absalom and Marrow are not only freakishly ugly from having bones poke through their skin , and all they can really do with it is break off their protruding bone and hit people with it .
12 . Able to generate pyrotechnic flares to create brilliant light and explosive force – Jubilee and Dazzler can make fireworks .

Kucinich addresses many issues at Reno rally
By James Ball ( JBALL@RGJ.COM ) , RENO GAZETTE -JOURNAL
Touching on issues ranging from Yucca Mountain to the Patriot Act and the war in Iraq , presidential hopeful Dennis Kucinich spoke to a crowd of several hundred people in Reno Saturday .
Despite a steady snowfall outside , a standing - room - only crowd packed into two meeting rooms at the Reno - Sparks Convention Center to hear what the Ohio Congressman and Democrat had to say about issues he 's most closely associated with : the environment and opposition to the war and the Bush administration in general .
Those expecting Kucinich to deliver harsh words about the president were n't disappointed , as the half - hour campaign speech soon turned to talk of impeachment .
" On the way over here , I was reading a 50 - page document that relates to Articles of Impeachment for the President of the United States , " Kucinich said to a standing ovation .
" And I want you to know that I 'm actually preparing this document for submission to the House . "
Kucinich said under the current administration , citizen 's rights to due process and fair trial are in jeopardy .
" This is a moment when we 're called upon to reclaim our country , " he said .
" You give me your vote , I 'll give you back your country . "
" Think about this .
The government has an engine of sustainability so that the Department of Transportation focuses on developing mass transit solutions .
The Department of Housing and Urban Development develops green housing with natural light and passive solar .
The Department of Energy incentivizes the production of wind and solar and green energy , " he told the crowd .
But most of those on hand were n't there to hear about global warming .
Bill Cantella of Reno made his way throughout the crowd , handing out Kucinich pamphlets and stickers simply reading " Impeach , " while others wore shirts and held banners bearing the same sentiment .
Cantella said Kucinich's " everyman " appeal draws him to the candidate .
" The most appealing thing about him to me is that he's not connected with special interests , international corporations and he does not accept campaign contributions from corporations or PACs . "
Cantella said .
" He 's not connected to the military industrial complex , oil companies and health insurance companies that rule our lives . "
He was quick , however , to point out that shunning such donations could , in fact , hurt Kucinich 's chances in a race populated by high - profile candidates like Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama on the Democratic side .
" That 's probably his biggest problem , " Cantella said .
" Because you have to have a lot of money to win the presidency of the United States . "
Kucinich 's wife , Elizabeth , who was raised in England , spoke about the perception that her husband traditionally has been seen as a fringe , extremist candidate .

Renters losing their homes without missing a payment Adam Doster
Published : Saturday November 17 , 2007

While the housing foreclosure crisis of 2007 negatively impacted many homeowners with shaky financial histories , thousands of families are losing their homes without ever missing a payment .
These residents are renters who had the unfortunate luck of living in houses whose landlords defaulted on their mortgages  a large but little noticed externality of the subprime fallout .
While it remains unclear many renters have been evicted because of foreclosures , the Mortgage Bankers Association took a survey earlier this year and found that one in eight foreclosures was non -owner - occupied .
But the association acknowledges that this figure likely underestimates the problem because building managers have an incentive to register as owner - occupied for tax reasons , even if the units are rented .
According to the New York Times , in Nevada , which has one of the highest foreclosure rates in the country , 28 percent of mortgages that were in default earlier this year were for homes not owner - occupied , more than twice the national average .
Arizona , Florida , and California , all states hit hard by foreclosures , are well above the national average as well .
 This is an explosion ,  said Judith Liben , a lawyer at the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute .
 This is nt business as usual .
These are investors that overleveraged themselves , and the renters are collateral damage in the mortgage crisis . 
Although the stakes are lower for renters than homeowners , mostly because renters do not stand to lose years of equity , many renters feel blindsided by the news that they could be evicted , especially if they have been diligent in their rent payments .
Cash for moving expenses and deposits on new rental properties can also be a financial drain , especially for tenants who had no idea their buildings were in danger of foreclosure .
On Thursday , the House passed a comprehensive mortgage act that includes protections for renters .
 The House act ,  reports the Times ,  which the lending industry has opposed , would require new owners to continue the leases of tenants for up to six months after foreclosure . 
Senator Christopher J. Dodd , Democrat of Connecticut , who introduced similar legislation in the Senate , said in a statement ,  A foreclosure doesnt differentiate between a homeowner and a renter residing in a defaulting property . 
Currently , most state or local laws do not provide this protection .

Le site lobbyfacts .eu dévoilé cette semaine par l’association Corporate Europe Observatory ( CEO ) permet enfin de juger de l’importance de ces « représentants d’intérêt ».
On a du mal à dire combien ils sont , entre 15.000 et 30.000 personnes selon les estimations .
Pas besoin néanmoins de connaître leur nombre exact pour savoir que les lobbyistes occupent le devant de la scène à Bruxelles .
Dans le minuscule quartier européen – 4 km2 environ – leurs bureaux ont essaimé partout autour des trois institutions de l’UE ( Commission , Parlement et Conseil ) afin de tenter d’influer sur le processus législatif communautaire .
Le site lobbyfacts .eu dévoilé cette semaine par l’association Corporate Europe Observatory ( CEO ) permet enfin de juger du poids de ces « représentants d’intérêt ».
Depuis quelques années , l’Europe a créé un registre d’enregistrement pour ces lobbyistes , consultable par chaque citoyen .
Mais le site était un tel fouillis qu’il faut des heures de labeur avant d’espérer autre chose que des données parcellaires .
D’où lobbyfacts.ue , une interface qui permet d’explorer sans maux de tête cette gigantesque base de données .
Principal enseignement : on peut enfin connaître le hit - parade des entreprises qui dépensent le plus en lobbying à Bruxelles .
Et le vainqueur est… l’Amérique !
Ce sont en effet trois entreprises américaines ( dans l’ordre Philipp Morris , ExxonMobil et Microsoft ) qui arrivent aux trois premières places , chacune dépensant plus de 4,5 millions d’euros par an à Bruxelles .
General Electric est également dans le Top 10 , signe que si Henry Kissinger ne savait pas à quel numéro appeler l’Europe , au moins ses compatriotes ont compris l’importance de l’UE .
Derrière les trois leaders américains , on trouve deux sociétés européennes qui célèbrent à leur manière le couple franco - allemand si important en Europe ( Siemens et GDF Suez ) .
Enfin il faut noter la présence au huitième rang du chinois Huawei , qui était il y a peu dans le viseur de la Commission européenne pour des pratiques supposées de dumping .
On peut donc imaginer que Huawei a su faire entendre ses arguments .
Ce hit - parade offre donc un aperçu intéressant des rapports de force économique .
Mais ce n’est qu’un aperçu incomplet : le registre d’enregistrement – même si c’est un progrès notable par rapport à ce qui ce passe dans certains Etats membres – n’est pas obligatoire , et beaucoup d’entreprises influentes l’évitent soigneusement .
Jean - Claude Juncker , le futur président de la Commission européenne , a promis d’y remédier .
Gerhard Schröder voudrait alléger les sanctions contre la Russie
Gerhard Schröder est ce qu’on appelle en Allemagne un « Russland - versteher » , un homme qui comprend la Russie .
Même en pleine crise ukrainienne , il l’assume .
«
Je revendique le fait de vouloir comprendre la Russie , ses gens et son leadership politique .
Je n’en ai pas honte , au contraire , j ’en suis fier » , a déclaré hier l’ancien chancelier allemand à Rostock , à l’occasion d’une conférence organisée par le Land de Mecklembourg - Poméranie avec des leaders économiques et politiques russes et allemands .
Le père de deux filles adoptives russes , devenu président du conseil de surveillance de Nord Stream , le gazoduc contrôlé par Gazprom , plaide pour la confiance et moins de confrontation dans les relations avec Moscou , alors que les sanctions pèsent déjà fortement sur les relations commerciales .
Au premier semestre , les exportations allemandes vers la Russie ont chuté de 15 % . «
Les sanctions réciproques créent des dommages immenses pour les deux parties » , déclaré le père de l ’Agenda 2010 , le programme de réformes entrepris par l’Allemagne dans les années 2000 .
Même si elle est consciente du coût des sanctions , Angela Merkel reste ferme .
« Nous sommes malheureusement très loin » d’adoucir les sanctions , a indiqué la chancelière en début de semaine , jugeant que l’histoire nécessitait parfois d’avoir le « souffle long ».
A Berlin , on s’attend à une crise qui durera plusieurs années …
Bruxelles demande à Londres des explications sur sa politique de lutte contre l’obésité
La presse britannique va encore pouvoir s’en donner à cœur joie contre Bruxelles .
Alors que la Grande - Bretagne compte le plus fort taux d’obèses et de personnes en sur-poids parmi les pays européens , un vrai sujet de santé publique , la Commission européenne a annoncé hier qu’elle ouvrait une procédure d’infraction contre le système d’étiquetage « anti-obésité » adopté outre - Manche .
Bruxelles se demande si cet étiquetage est judicieux et n’amalgame pas malbouffe et produits du terroir .
Outre - Manche , un étiquetage note en vert , orange ou rouge la valeur calorique et la teneur en gras , gras saturés , sel et sucre des aliments .
Il est pour l’instant entré en vigueur en Grande - Bretagne sur une base volontaire .
Nombre d’associations de consommateurs louent sa simplicité et le citent en exemple dans la lutte contre l’obésité .
En revanche , l ’industrie agro-alimentaire ne l’apprécie guère .
D’autant plus qu’il peut entrer en contradiction avec ses arguments marketing .
L’Italie bataille depuis des mois contre ce dispositif , au motif qu’il risquerait de disqualifier le parmesan ou d’autres produits du terroir .
Au nom du marché unique et de la libre circulation des biens , la Commission européenne demande donc des explications au gouvernement britannique .
Il a deux mois pour répondre .
Un de ses porte - paroles explique que Bruxelles s’inquiète du « caractère simpliste » de cet étiquetage , qui pourrait « créer des idées fausses chez le consommateur » et « rendre plus difficile le marketing de certains produits et empêcher la libre circulation des biens ».

A local woman 's low - slung jeans , which offer a view of her buttocks , landed her in Portsmouth District Court on Monday .
PORTSMOUTH —
A local woman 's low - slung jeans , which offer a view of her buttocks , landed her in Portsmouth District Court on Monday .
Elli Skiff , 27 , who cites her address as the Cross Roads House homeless shelter , 600 Lafayette Road , was summoned to the court for arraignment on a charge of criminal trespassing .
Police allege that , on Sept. 1 , Skiff was asked to leave Newington 's Fox Run Mall and after refusing to do so , was charged with the misdemeanor crime .
According to mall security , Skiff was instructed to leave because of her revealing pants .
Following her arrest , Skiff was released on $ 500 personal recognizance bail .
She is scheduled to return to the district court on Nov. 8 for trial .
I was just talking to a friend who said he booked a trip to Ireland on Aer Lingus .
This made me wonder what would happen if that airline merged with , oh , let ’s say Continental Airlines .
This new company , potentially named Conaerlingus , would get people ’s attention .
But would you be concerned about your flight going down ?
For some reason this reminds me of one of the great mysteries of life :
Why do attractive women pay for massages ?
For most of us , there ’s a good reason we pay another human to rub us for an hour .
If we did n’t offer money , or reciprocate with some rubbing of our own , no one would take the job .
But if you are a hot woman , lots of people would volunteer to spend an hour rubbing your nearly naked body for free .
So in a sense , an attractive woman is n’t paying for the same thing everyone else is .
For her , the massage is always free , and she ’s paying someone to pretend it is n’t .
Moving along , I have long maintained , and have been mercilessly mocked for , my opinion that voting is irrational for an individual .
While I support the system as a whole , wherein potential revolutionaries are transformed into docile citizens via the illusion of having some influence on election outcomes , it is irrational to vote as long as many others do .
Here ’s a better take on this idea from some people who have something I do n’t , i.e. credibility :

What did my three topics today have in common ?
( There is a real answer . )
[ Answer :
All three topics are things that happen before you get screwed . ]
Brazil 's power generators are on Defcon red in anticipation of a whopping power surge at the end of hit soap opera Tropical Paradise , which could theoretically blackout the entire country should the flow of juice prove inadequate .
According to AP , TV Globo says 90 per cent of the nation 's TV viewers will be glued to their sets on Friday " to learn who murdered the scheming villain Tais and to find out if Bebel , the Pygmalion - like prostitute , will live happily ever after " .
An anonymous power company spokesman explained : " We are worried about a possible blackout caused by a sudden surge in electricity at the end of the program .
When it is all over , millions of people will get up from their armchairs and sofas to turn on the lights of their living rooms , open the refrigerator for a cold beer or heat a meal in the microwave oven . "
Mercifully , he added that " extra generating capacity is customarily geared up for during soccer games and other programs that attract large audiences " , so the powers that be have plenty of previous experience to allow them to judge the total megawatts required to cover 150 million shaken Brazilians simultaneously opening their fridges in search of a beer after learning Bebel the Pygmalion - like prostitute was finally carried off into the sunset by an Albanian human slave trafficker .
For those of you not familiar with these so - called telenovelas , a good one will become a national obsession running over the average 200 episodes .
And if you 're thoroughly sick and tired of fellow office workers banging on about their favourite contestant in Big Brother , you should count yourselves lucky you do n't have to sit through relentless analysis along the lines of " so , do you think Teresa the mulatta slave girl will eventually succumb to the charms of Jose , the cruel yet devilishly handsome son of the sugar plantation owner , or will he sensationally reveal that they are in fact brother and sister after his father 's dalliance with Dolores the feisty housemaid ?

Under Bush 's watch , decay of public firefighting has spawned billion dollar private industry Miriam Raftery

Print This Email This Trade group founded in 2000 now represents 10,000 private firefighters SAN DIEGO - After the Great Fire of London in 1666 , insurance companies started issuing plaques to show private fire brigades which homes to save -- and which to let burn .
Insurers organized their own firefighting companies .
Not having a plaque didnt mean your home went totally ignored , but it certainly didnt help .
Today , a decline in public funding for firefighting services has sparked explosive growth in the private sector .
The worlds largest insurance company  American Insurance Group  now has  Wildfire Protection Units  in 150 US zip codes .
During the 2007 California wildfires , AIGs firefighters saved homes in wealthy areas , while less fortunate neighbors were left with rubble .
A trade group for private firefighters founded in 2000 now represents 10,000 private firemen .
Rancho Bernardo , a wealthy San Diego community that lost 365 homes during the October fires , has just one fire station for a 24 - mile area .
The city fails to meet the minimum standards for accreditation recommended by the National Fire Protection Association , which requires a minimum of one station for every nine miles .
In a blistering interview earlier this month , San Diego Fire Chief Tracy Jarman told the San Diego Union - Tribune that the city was left on its own to fight the October wildfires and was woefully unprepared , despite the fact that some richer homeowners had their own private army .
With two fires blazing into Rancho Bernardo , Jarman called Cal Fire to request immediate air support and 150 strike teams from the state : 750 fire engines and 3,000 firefighters .
Cal Fires response ?
Nothing was available .
But while Cal Fire balked , AIG firefighter Sam Crays was saving homes for clients .
` We love putting out fires , '' Crays told Bloomberg News , noting that his unit was able to extinguish a fire in a nearby uninsured home .
But , he added , adjacent homeowners werent always so lucky .
 There were a few instances where we were spraying and the neighbor 's house went up like a candle . 
Last month , former San Diego fire chief Jeff Bowman told a Congressional hearing that he left his job in April 2006 over abject frustration because repeated recommendations went unheeded .
He said he urged the County buy at least 50 fire engines , each staffed by at least 12 firefighters and add 22 fire stations .
 People have to understand that there will eventually be loss of life on a massive scale if nothing happens ,  said Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - CA ) , who convened the hearing on the Southern California fires .
The senator described seeing pockmarked  areas of burned neighborhoods in Rancho Bernardo , where obviously the fire wasnt fought ,  yet a few houses remained oddly unscathed amid the rubble .
 It s a terrible mistake to have to go to private firefighting ,  the California Democrat told RAW STORY after the hearing .
 I deeply believe that San Diego has to change the size of its fire resources . 
Private firefighters deployed in California wildfires Firebreak Spray Systems Company , a private company headquartered in Oregon , treated about 200 homes in Rancho Bernando and other enclaves fortunate enough to afford premium insurance during the recent fires .
 We had eight trucks responding to fires there in Southern California ,  Firebreak CEO Jim Aamodt said .
The companys private fire brigade sprayed homes with Phos - Chek , the same fire retardant chemical used in forest fires .
 None that we treated burned ,  Aamodt added .
 We identified 12 saves in which we were able to either put our fires , or they burned right up to the Phos - Chek line . 
The company offers pre-treatments and automated sprinkler applications to its clients , as well as dispatching trained wildlife firefighters to treat homes and brush during actual fires .
Firebreak also offers concierge - style fire protection services for AIG policyholders during wildfires .
AIG has also sent private firefighting teams to other richer areas in Sun Valley , Idaho , Malibu , California and Colorado resort communities .
 We are getting a tremendous amount of insurance interest now since this publicity hit ,  Aamodt said .
Private firefighting spreads nationally Fighting fires has become big business .
The National Wildfire Suppression Association ( NWSA ) , a trade organization founded in 2000 , now represents over 200 private companies and 10,000 wild land firefighters .
The private firefighting industry is estimated to be worth billions of dollars .
Some cities and counties are now hiring private contractors to replace public services provided by unionized firefighters .
According to the Heartland Institute , a conservative pro-privatization think tank , Lakewood , Illinois has contracted with American Emergency Service Corporation to provide fire protection .
The companys employees are non-union ; Heartland asserts that wage and benefits costs are lower than those incurred by fire districts that hire their own firefighters and paramedics . 
Another private firefighting contractor , Rural / Metro , provides private fire protection services to over 25 communities , according to the companys website .
Other contractors offer specialties ; Halliburton , for instance , focuses on dousing oil well fires .
Other large companies with fire protection divisions include Kellogg , Brown , and Root and Spain - based Avialsa .
The U.S. government also uses private contractors to abet firefighting efforts on federal lands .
The practice began during the Clinton administration in response to a decline in the logging industry and a shortage of lumberjack - firefighters to combat forest fires .
Since 2000 , the industry has mushroomed .
Not every marriage between private firefighting contractors and government entities is made in heaven .
In Florida , the town of Estero hired Wackenhut Corp. to run its fire department .
But after a private firefighter was killed , the Occupational Safety and Health Administrated cited the company for safety violations .
As a result , Estero canceled the contract and resurrected its public fire department .
According to an audit report on Forest Service firefighting contract crews conducted by the U.S. Department of Agricultures Office of Inspector General , private crews used in the 2002 Biscuit Fire in Oregon , insufficiently trained and inexperienced crews negatively impacted firefighting efforts .
 We had crew performance problems on the fire line .
We also had issues of falsified training records ,  Rod Nichols , information officer with the Oregon Department of Forestry , told RAW STORY .
Some companies hired undocumented immigrants and sent non-English speaking crews out with supervisors who did not speak Spanish , he added .
 Since then , we believe weve overcome a lot of those problems ,  Nichols said .
He cited changes in procedures , discipline and dismissal of some offending companies and a reduction in private crews among the improvements made .
 In the past 10 years , wild - land firefighting has transformed from a federal government responsibility to a massive , extremely lucrative , private enterprise ,  Slate Magazine wrote in a 2002 article sharply critical of the practice .
 Privatizing firefighting was supposed to cut costs .
But it has done nothing of the sort .
Last summer , which was an " average " fire season , was the most costly on record .
The 2001 fire season cost an average of $ 1,340 per acre to fight fires in national forests 270 percent more than it did in 2000 , the magazine said .
The politics of private - firefighting Some private firefighting firms or their owners have made hefty donations to the Republican Party and prominent elected officials .
Mike Wheelock , owner of Greyback Forestry Inc. in Oregon , one of the largest and most elite private firefighting contractors with substantial federal contracts , gave a whopping $ 25,000 to the Republican National Congressional Committee in 2006 , as well as large donations to George W. Bushs presidential campaign and other prominent GOP leaders .
Privatization of government services is a key plank promoted by prominent Republican leaders including conservative strategist Grover Norquist  the Washington maven famously quoted for his desire to shrink government to be small enough to drown it in a bathtub .
In 2005 , a media strategist for California Gov. Arnold Schwarzeneggers told campaign donors of a plan to promote a `phenomenon of anger aimed at turning California voters against firefighters and other public employee union members to help pass ballot initiatives aimed at breaking up public unions and , perhaps , support privatization of firefighting and other public services .
 What were going to hear more of is sort of blaming the victims of these natural disasters who dont pay the higher premiums to get this special service ,  author of The Shock Doctrine : The Rise of Disaster Capitalism Naomi Klein said on Democracy Now !
Radio in July .
 You 're starting to hear the language of personal responsibility ` It s up to you to protect you and your family .
You cant look to the government .
The history of private firefighting is rife with controversy , and historians disagree on whether private firefighters have deliberately avoided protecting homes other than those insured .
Last year , San Diegos City Council approved a ballot initiative aimed at privatizing some city services .
But critics contend privatization could lead to problems such as Philadelphia encountered , when fire hydrants froze due to lack of maintenance .
Feinstein grills San Diego officials California politicians leveled sharp criticism at city leaders at Feinsteins hearing last month .
Other California politicians pointed fingers at the federal and state government for failing to coordinate swift dispatch of military aircraft armed with state - trained spotters in the first 48 hours of the fires .
 Im a real private sector guy , but when Rome is burning , you have to have first responders ,  said Republican Congressman Elton Gallegly , who represents Californias Ventura and Santa Barbara counties .
Feinstein is proposing legislation that would offer incentives for purchasing firefighting equipment to local governments that adopt fire - safe building codes in wildfire - prone areas .
San Diego officials note that some improvements have been made since the 2003 Cedar Fire .
The County has spent $ 117 million , including purchase of firefighting helicopters and vehicles , upgrading communications , removing dead trees and other measures , according to Supervisor Dianne Jacob , who supports creation of a county fire department .
San Diego city officials were quick to fault voters for failing to approve a bond measure which would have increased funding for firefighting services .
But former Chief Bowman laid blame squarely on elected officials .
 I doubt if the average voter understands that only 17 cents of every property tax dollar goes to local government ,  Bowman remarked .
 What it takes is leaders who will stand up ,  he said , adding that public officials should educate voters on how tax dollars are spent and why more money is needed .
Fire and police protection are the two most important services  and should be publicly provided , Feinstein said .
 I think people now see this is a pattern and everything they hold dear could just dissolve . 
“ The Central Intelligence Agency owns everyone of any significance in the major media . ” ~ William Colby , former CIA director
THOSE DEMOCRATS WHO DON'T KNOW HISTORY , ARE DOOMED TO REPEAT IT :
When Bill Clinton was first running for President , he had a revolutionary challenger in the Democratic Primary , named Jerry Brown .
Brown had been the former Governor of California , as well as the State Chair of the California Democratic Party .
He had been revolutionary , pushing hard for labor rights for farmworkers to protect them from agri-industrial poisons , he ’d funded those large wind energy projects along the length of California , and had introduced satellite conference calls to California Government .
The corporate interests he threatened needed to divorce this man of the people , this man of vision . . . from the people he served so well .
So , they called him “ Governor Moon Beam . ”
The name caught on .
What it was in reference to , although few in the media or public looked beyond that funny name as they laughed at Brown , was Brown ’s idea of using satellite phone technology for meetings .
Rather than having state legislators fly back to Sacremento everytime they needed to meet , they could use this new technology and save time , energy , etc .
Of course today , everyone , all companies use this technology , and it was brilliant back then .
But , “ Governor Moonbeam ” was the label some bright boys hired by the corporate powers Brown was slapped with .
It made people laugh at him .
It worked .
Then years later after serving as California State Chair of the CA Democratic Party , Brown decided to run for President .
BUT , he refused to take a donation over $ 100 .
WHY ?
Because he ’d learned as State Chair that money had taken over politics .
He had raised more money than any other Chair before , but no matter how much he raised , they always needed more .
Brown said that in that system you lose touch with real people , real needs .
You lose touch with the reality of America , when you only have time to sit down with people who can write multi- thousand dollar checks .
He refused to accept more than $ 100 donations from any one person .
The corporate media made fun of him .
So in his Presidential campaign , Brown lived among ordinary people , depended on them for rides , and broke bread with them at their tables .
He refused to accept more than $ 100 donations from any one person .
The corporate media made fun of him .
Then Brown won Colorado , beating Bill Clinton soundly .
The foundations of American power were shaken .
Almost immediately , Ted Koppel ’s Nightline , brought on several anonymous , hooded figures , to character assassinate Brown .
It was all lies but Koppel did n’t seem to care , and the public did n’t care .
Oh , those who really knew Brown were outraged , but the public bought it .
His campaign was ruined , and Bill Clinton , the chosen one , sailed into power so that he could later enable trade agreements that would decimate American labor , and war crimes abroad .
His crimes included ad hoc bombings , boycotts and sanctions designed to starve human beings into submission , and supporting ethnic cleansing in brutal counterinsurgency warfare , and the devastation by bombing designed to return rogues to the stone age and keep them there .
Of course it was “ all for a good cause ” we were told .
I bought it .
I thought , geez he ’s a Democrat , this ca n’t really be a bad thing .
On June 26 , 1993 , Clinton bombed Baghdad to pay them back for an unproven plot to kill President George Bush .
Eight Iraqi civilians , including the distinguished Iraqi artist Layla al - Attar were killed in the raid , and 12 more were wounded .
This kind of unilateral action in response to an unproven charge is a violation of international law .
In 1998 Clinton bombed Afghanistan and the Sudan .
Unknown numbers were killed in Afghanistan ( and by the missiles that accidentally landed in Pakistan ) , and the pharmaceutical factory destroyed in the Sudan was the major source of medical drugs in that poor country .
All evidence points to the fact that the Sudan factory destroyed had no connection whatever to chemical weapons or Bin Laden , and was bombed on the basis of insufficient and poorly evaluated data .
But following the attacks on U.S. embassies in Africa , Clinton felt compelled to act for internal political reasons once again , and there are no international constraints or costs to him or his country if he chooses to bomb small and weak countries to score political points at home .
Clinton
’s sanctions on Iraq were brutal .
According to UNICEF , more than one - million Iraqi children under five suffered malnutrition , which resulted in 4,000 to 5,000 children dying per month beyond normal death rates .
In the US war against Yugoslavia under Clinton , there were attacks on Yugoslav Television and 60 % of overall NATO targets were civilian , including 33 hospitals and 344 schools , and 144 industrial plants .
Targets included hotels , libraries , museums , churches , monasteries , youth centers , theatres , and housing estates .
And today , we have a Hillary and Obama , darlings of the corporate media , who will end the war in Iraq . . . sort of . . . and have made no indication they will in any way change the business as usual in global politics and war empire .
Then , on the other hand , we have Ron Paul , who wishes to decimate the CIA militarist global empire and end this misery that supports resource theft and slave labor markets for corporations .
Who will the media make fun of ?
Who will the media smear ?
What I find the saddest , is that Liberals and Progressives , who ’ve I ’ve worked side by side with in anti-war and human rights causes . . . will bleat like sheep , and parrot all the character assassinations the CIA plants in their corporate media lackey ’s mouths .
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RvLL--vSsA
For her courage her own Democratic Party leaders turned on her or turned away from her as the CIA controlled media hounds were unleashed upon her .
This brave woman is now the Green Party Candidate , and if she garners the kind of support Ron Paul has , the CIA controlled media will turn on her again .
And as before , the Democratic leadership will parrot the media 's attacks on her .
It will be liberals and progressives who will turn on the last greatest hope we have of saving our democracy and ending the brutal CIA run global corporate empire .
After 9/11 , when the Democrats were licking the boots of Bush and the neo-cons , there was one shining knight who stood tall against them .
Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney demanded to know what happened to the $ 2.3 TRILLION Rumsfeld said the Pentagon " lost . "
She demanded to know more about the connections between Bush and the Bin Laden family , and she demanded to know who ordered the mysterious war games to be held coincidentally on 9/11/2001 , and why they were not called off when the attacks began .
For her courage her own Democratic Party leaders turned on her or turned away from her as the CIA controlled media hounds were unleashed upon her .
This brave woman is now the Green Party Candidate , and if she garners the kind of support Ron Paul has , the CIA controlled media will turn on her again .
And as before , the Democratic leadership will parrot the media 's attacks on her .
Suddenly , I wake up and can hardly believe that I ever knew these people in the first place .
It ’s like invasion of the body snatchers , and they are all screaming their alarms at Ron Paul , the one candidate who has not been replaced with the soul of a CIA militarist pod .
On NBC's Meet the Press last week , Ron Paul shook the foundations of the illegal war mongering power structures of America .
He 'll have hell to pay .
His only hope is that the people he is standing up for , the average peace and justice loving American , will stand up for Ron Paul .
Michael Cohen Responds Further
Below are further thoughts from Michael Cohen , following on this ( from me ) and this ( from him ) .
He sent it to me after posting it as a comment at L'Homme de Poor .
As an exciting bonus , I 've responded myself at the end .
It 's worth reading if you 're interested in this subject , but I would encourage you not to be .
Look what happened to me .
• • •
From Michael Cohen :
It pains me to have to enter this debate again , but after reading the back and forth here ( and as the man ultimately responsible for this entire debate ) I feel the need to weigh in one last time .
Let me , as quickly as possible , try to clarify a few points .
First and foremost , we must remember one salient fact about Iraq 's WMD programs after 1991 - the country had an affirmative responsibility to reveal to the UN the extent and history of their WMD programs .
This is a crucial point .
Iraq had to not only destroy what they had , but they were required to come clean about the programs they had developed in the past .
Again , this was an affirmative responsibility - well it was more than a responsibility , it was international law as signed through UN resolutions .
Saddam HAD to comply and just to make sure he did , the Security Council authorized the use of force to ensure their enforcement .
And why did he have to comply – because he had invaded a sovereign nation , was defeated and was then forced to comply with said resolutions in order to achieve a cessation of hostilities .
These are not minor points and it ’s important to remember them .
This entire crisis , from 1990 to the present day was indeed set in motion by Iraq ’s invasion of Kuwait in the Summer of 1990 .
Now back to 1998 .
People can talk all they want about Saddam 's motivation for not complying with inspectors .
But it 's largely irrelevant to the underlying issue .
His responsibility was clear and as UN report after UN report makes clear , he evaded that responsibility .
Now , in my post I argued that UNSCOM reports , " make clear that the United Nations believed Iraq was not being honest about its WMD programs . "
I can't even imagine why this is under debate .
Read the reports .
They lay out in great detail what UNSCOM believed .
Jonathon Schwartz does n't agree and uses a quote from Scott Ritter , another from a Canadian inspector and another from Rolf Ekeus , two years after the period in question .
Astoundingly , he uses these quotes to attack my argument and in turn calls me misleading .
This is breathtaking and I 'm a little stunned that the folks at this site let him get away with it .
Let 's be clear the basis for my argument is an OFFICIAL UN report .
It has the imprimateur of the United Nations .
Scott Ritter can say whatever he wants , but these reports make clear the OFFICIAL position of the United Nations regarding Saddam 's WMD programs .
To say that my evidence is a bit stronger than Jonathon ’s is quite the understatement .
I agree with the folks here that the debate between kicked out and withdrawn is a distinction without a difference .
But facts are facts and the reality is that Saddam prevented the inspectors from doing their job .
Amazingly , this is point confirmed by none other than Mr. Schwartz who in his initial response to me concedes that Saddam was " blocking the inspections . "
That is the crux of the issue .
In the summer / fall of 1998 Saddam stopped complying with UN inspectors .
I do n’t think anyone disagrees with this point .
Still do n’t believe me , here ’s the NYT from November 1998 : " In its most serious challenge to the United Nations in more than a year of intermittent crises , Iraq said today that it was ending all cooperation with international arms inspectors and would close their long - term monitoring operations immediately .
The action , announced in Baghdad after a meeting of President Saddam Hussein and his top advisers , goes beyond even the Iraqi ban on spot inspections imposed since August and in effect bars almost all surveillance of Iraq 's weapons programs . "
http://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=FA0E12FB395B0C728CDDA80994D0494D81
It was from that act by Saddam that the crisis with the UN ensued and inspectors were eventually forced to leave .
Now we can argue over why Saddam stopped complying .
Jonathon ’s notion that Saddam did so out of concern for his safety is , I believe , patently absurd .
Was he concerned for his safety when he made every effort to prevent inspectors from doing their job in the previous seven years ?
Let us also remember that in 1998 Saddam did n’t plead that his life was at risk if he complied with UN inspections – he complained that inspections of his presidential palaces was an affront to Iraqi sovereignty .
Since inspectors were allowed , under UN resolutions , to go wherever they wanted , whenever they wanted this was an absurd claim .
But really the motivation is meaningless .
Saddam refused to comply .
Under the resolutions he signed , he had no right to do so .
He could have gone back to the Security Council , presented evidence that UNSCOM was infiltrated by US spies or claimed that his safety was at risk .
I believe he did neither .
Instead he stopped complying with inspectors , in effect forcing their withdrawal .
The entire crisis of 1998 was precipitated by Saddam ’s actions .
For me to argue that Saddam prevented UN inspectors from doing their job is not misleading – it ’s a fact .
Finally , the notion that the United Nations agreed “ there was a “ defensible case ” for war in Iraq ” is dismissed as misleading – it is anything but .
Before I get into this point , let ’s do a little but of history .
In the Fall of 2002 , the US went to the Security Council and demanded that Iraq comply with the UN resolutions they had been ignoring for the previous four years ( I mistakenly wrote five in my initial post ) .
The Security Council responded by passing Resolution 1441 , which warned of “ serious consequences ” for Iraq if they failed to comply with the resolutions they had already signed .
Now some will argue that Security Council resolutions are rarely enforced , citing resolutions related to Israel as an example .
Please find me a resolution that warns Israel of “ serious consequences ” if it fails to comply .
Moreover , many of the harshest resolutions related to Israel are General Assembly resolutions , not Security Council resolutions .
However , whatever the case of earlier resolutions , “ serious consequences ” in the lexicon of UN verbiage is pretty tough language .
In fact , it ’s tougher than the language put forth in the cease fire resolution of 1991 , which states rather tepidly that the Security Council , “ Decides to remain seized of the matter and to take such further steps as may be required for the implementation of the present resolution and to secure peace and security in the area . ”
Let us not forget , it was these words , in part , that the US , backed by the UN , used to enforce compliance in the months and years after the end of the Gulf War .
It was not simply the Bush Administration , but there were others who believed that if Saddam had refused to comply , the US would have been under legal right to use military force to ensure compliance .
Now , Jonathon cities the words of UN ambassadors from other nations saying that the resolution was not an automatic trigger to force – but those are political statements .
From a legal standpoint , I would imagine that the US could have legally claimed that the “ serious consequences ” referenced in 1441 was enough legal cover to go to war – IF SADDAM REFUSED TO COMPLY .
Here ’s the rub : the gambit worked .
Saddam let the inspectors back in , which from my perspective invalidates the entire US basis for war .
But to say that Security Council did not provide a defensible basis for war – well it ’s a matter of conjecture , not “ wetter than a drowned fish ” and not misleading .
This gets me to the most frustrating element of this debate .
I , for one , agree with Jonathon and other who argue that the war in Iraq was wrong .
My only point of disagreement is whether there was a justifiable / defensible case for war .
On this point , the facts speak for themselves : Saddam was refusing to comply with UN inspectors , he had a track record of aggressive behavior against his neighbors ; he had used WMD twice , once against Iran and once against the Kurds and most important , by the Fall of 2002 , nearly everyone agreed – on both sides of the Atlantic and the political aisle – that Saddam had stockpiles of WMD .
Here ’s another crazy fact : his own generals thought he had them !
Congrats to Jonathon for being a correct skeptic , but the evidence was overwhelming that Saddam had something to hide and he had n’t come clean .
Moreover , as I said earlier , it was not the responsibility of the US and others to prove that Saddam had WMD – it was his responsibility to prove that he did n’t .
Only after the UN Security Council voted 15 - 0 and threatened force did Saddam kind of , sort of come clean – yet even then he never acknowledged that he did n’t publicly have WMD .
Why , is a question that only he could have answered .
Maybe someday he ’ll let Satan know .
In the end , the defensible case for war did not measure up to scrutiny .
While the United States may have been justified in threatening war , I do n’t believe for a second that war with Iraq made any rational sense .
On this point , I think we all agree – and hopefully we can leave it at that .
I appreciate that Michael Cohen took the time to write this .
However , as it stands , I think this is pretty much the end of the road for any useful discussion .
That 's because of Cohen 's focus here on international law .
That would be fine , except ... the United States has absolutely no interest in international law , beyond its usefulness in legitimizing what we want to do anyway .
If the UN does what we tell it to , great .
If they do n't , but we can try to claim they did ( as with Cohen 's no - fly zone and 1441 examples ) , that 's fine too .
But if not , we 're certainly not going to let something as preposterous as words on paper stop us .
That 's not surprising , given our power and the fact our government is made up of human beings .
But it is what it is .
I 'd guess Cohen is well aware of this , but perhaps he 's not .
I remember having an exchange on Iraq with Lee Feinstein sometime in 2002 - 3 .
He was making exactly the appeal to international law that Cohen is , how it must be obeyed at all times in every way to the exact letter and it's the only thing that ever matters , etc .
I sent him a long list of gigantic violations of international law by the US and our allies and asked if he felt the same concern in those cases .
He said something like : " Huh . I never thought of it that way . "
( Feinstein apparently just joined Hillary Clinton 's presidential campaign as her director for foreign policy and national security . )
Now , if Cohen will acknowledge this — that the US consistently , including when Cohen was at the UN , uses international law to wipe its international ass *— and thus our actions re Iraq obviously had nothing to do with law and everything to do with power , then we could move forward .
Short of that , it 's like having a long discussion about Phil Spector 's horrible behavior toward women with O.J. Simpson .
Finally , here are a few specific objections — not everything by any means , but just what I had time to get to .
1. Jonathon ’s notion that Saddam did so [ blocked inspections ] out of concern for his safety is , I believe , patently absurd .
( a) It 's not my notion .
It 's the conclusion of the CIA .
Cohen writes as though what happened is some kind of unfathomable mystery .
It 's the exact opposite .
We actually invaded Iraq , took it over , and captured its government documents and top officials .
If people want to know what happened , the best evidence we have is in the CIA 's report .
It will tell you that — particularly after Hussein Kamel 's defection — Iraq 's actions were motivated by exactly what they claimed they were motivated by at the time .
That was predominantly concerns over Saddam 's safety , Iraqi national security , and a belief that there was no point to cooperation with UNSCOM because ( as the Clinton administration itself said repeatedly ) we would never allow sanctions to be lifted whether Iraq was disarmed or not .
In addition to what I previously quoted , here 's more :
The IIS [ Iraqi Intelligence Service ] , responsible for counterintelligence , was the lead organization charged with monitoring UN inspection activities and personnel ...
The IIS believed that all foreigners were spying on the security of Saddam Husayn or were seeking military or security information ...
As soon as the UNSCOM mission began focusing on presidential sites , the SSO [ Special Security Organization ] became actively involved in the inspection process ...
The SSO was primarily responsible for the security of the President and other key members of the Regime , security of Presidential palaces and facilities , and ensuring the loyalty of key military units , principally the RG and SRG ... [ SSO officers ] were also to hide any contingency war plans , anything dealing with Saddam ’s family , SSO personnel rosters , or financial data which could have posed a risk to Iraq national security ... The SSO officer on - site had authority to use whatever means was necessary to keep the team from entering the site before it was fully sanitized ...
Saddam , Tariq ‘ Aziz , and other senior Regime officials realized by August 1998 that Iraq would not be able to satisfy UNSCOM and the UN Security Council and have sanctions lifted .
This led Saddam to suspend cooperation with UNSCOM ...
Etc. , etc. , etc .
( b) Even if we knew nothing at all about the underlying reality , I 'd find it weird for Cohen to characterize as " patently absurd " the idea that Saddam Hussein was motivated by his personal safety .
Paranoid dictators as a class often are .
Beyond that , two seconds after the UN resolutions on WMD were passed in 1991 , the George H.W. Bush administration said it wanted to see Saddam overthrown whether Iraq disarmed or not .
The Clinton administration repeatedly said it wanted Saddam overthrown .
In 1998 Congress passed a law saying the policy of the US regarding Iraq was regime change .
If Iran declared its policy toward the US was regime change , would Cohen find it absurd if the U.S. Secret Service sometimes blocked Iranian spies from wandering around the White House ?
( c) Cohen also found it patently absurd to think Iraq did n't have any banned weapons .
I think he might usefully consider whether he could learn something from that about his judgment on Iraq generally .
2 . Let us also remember that in 1998 Saddam did n’t plead that his life was at risk if he complied with UN inspections
Here are some examples of what Iraqi officials said about the conflict between Iraq and UNSCOM .
Note that Michael Cohen was chief speechwriter to Bill Richardson when Richardson was US Ambassador to the UN from 1997 - 98 .
Lehrer Newshour
January 14 , 1998 JIM LEHRER : The U.N. Security Council resolution passed today unanimously says Iraq 's behavior is unacceptable .
What 's your reaction to that , sir ?
NIZAR HAMDOON [ Iraqi ambassador to the UN ] : ... We are not saying that Iraq should dictate the composition of the team , but in the same time we cannot accept this unprecedented composition of this particular team , which has never happened before , to see a team that is heavily dominated by the Americans and the Brits .
JIM LEHRER : What 's the problem with that ?
NIZAR HAMDOON : Well , given the -- policy of the United States , of the United Kingdom , Iraq thinks that such teams are only going to create more suspicions , going to create tensions , and problems ... we all know about the plans the U.S. Government has for Iraq to overthrow the regime ... For that reason we cannot accept .
And :
AFP
November 11 , 1997
The United States pressed other powers Monday to slap a travel ban on Iraq as Baghdad dug in its heels , refusing to allow US experts to take part in enforcing UN sanctions ...
In talks earlier , Aziz reiterated Baghdad 's position that the UN special commission on disarmament was dominated by Americans carrying out a plot by Washington to overthrow Saddam .
AFP
November 10 , 1997 UN Secretary General Kofi Annan on Sunday debriefed three envoys returning from a fruitless mission to Baghdad , and described the 10 - day UN - Iraq crisis as " serious " ...
But Saddam also signalled he was still open to compromise , and explained the actions against the US inspectors were " defensive . "
Iraq accuses them of spying for the US administration in hopes of ensuring Saddam 's overthrow .
And :
CNN
November 7 , 1997 TARIQ AZIZ , IRAQI DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER : This is not U.N. conduct .
This is a confusion between United Nations objectives and the United States objectives against Iraq , and UNSCOM is being used as a means and a cover .
CNN : The Iraqis accuse American inspectors of behaving in a provocative way , spying on presidential security units and seeking to weaken and topple President Saddam Hussein .
Here 's a little more on Iraq 's stated concerns regarding UNSCOM .
The other guest on Larry King Live that night was Cohen 's boss Bill Richardson .
November 13 , 1997
Larry King Live AZIZ : Well , in the present circumstances , as you know very well , the American administration is planning a military attack on Iraq ... When another country is planning a military attack on you and sends a spy plane , a spying plane under the cover of the United Nations , what does that mean ?
They want to update their information about our air defenses , about our military units , about our sensitive sites ... and then use this updated information to have a precise -- precise targets .
Here 's an US Air Force history of Desert Fox :
In response to Saddam ’s intransigent behavior President Bill Clinton declared on December 16 that Hussein had “ abused his last chance ” and that he had directed US forces to strike military and regime security targets in Iraq ... the President only hinted at a broader political goal , one beyond the immediate aims of crippling Iraq ’s WMD programs .
The best way to eliminate the threat Saddam posed to the security of the Middle East and the world , the President claimed , was “ with a new Iraqi government " ...
President Clinton ’s reference to a “ new Iraqi government ” could certainly be seen as an implied objective of DESERT FOX ... [ F ] rom the large list of WMD - related targets , US and British aircraft would eventually strike only eleven during DESERT FOX and these were nearly all missile - related ...
The final DESERT FOX target list contained roughly 100 sites or facilities , including the eleven noted above ... American and British planners benefited from the wealth of information on Iraq ’s WMD and security apparatus gathered over several years by UNSCOM .
3 . Only after the UN Security Council voted 15 - 0 and threatened force did Saddam kind of , sort of come clean – yet even then he never acknowledged that he did n’t publicly have WMD .
Iraq 's National Assembly passed a law banning WMD in early February , 2003 .
Saddam Hussein said this in an interview with Dan Rather broadcast on February 26 , 2003 :
SADDAM : I think America and the world also knows that Iraq no longer has the weapons .
And I believe the mobilization that 's been done was , in fact , done partly to cover the huge lie that was being waged against Iraq about chemical , biological and nuclear weapons ...
RATHER : Will the new proposed United Nations resolution , the one that 's just out this week -- will this make any difference at all in your position ?
SADDAM : The basic position , there is no change .
We have not pursued any weapons of mass destruction .
Saddam also delivered a speech in Arabic on Iraqi national TV , described in Hans Blix 's book :
Saddam did make a speech on his son's television channel ...
In it , he noted that Iraq had had weapons of mass destruction in the past , but that it had none now .

In conclusion : I am very , very tired .
* International ass joke borrowed from here and then modified under fair use conventions .
It happened again .
There I was , meeting with someone who I thought had nothing to do with books or publishing , and it turns out his new book just came out .
With more than 75,000 books published every year ( not counting ebooks or blogs ) , the odds are actually pretty good that you ’ve either written a book , are writing a book or want to write one .
Hence this short list :
Lower your expectations .
The happiest authors are the ones that do n’t expect much .
The best time to start promoting your book is three years before it comes out .
Three years to build a reputation , build a permission asset , build a blog , build a following , build credibility and build the connections you ’ll need later .
Pay for an eidtor editor .
Not just to fix the typos , but to actually make your ramblings into something that people will choose to read .
I found someone I like working with at the EFA .
One of the things traditional publishers used to do is provide really insightful , even brilliant editors ( people like Fred Hills and Megan Casey ) , but alas , that does n’t happen very often .
And hiring your own editor means you ’ll value the process more .
Understand that a non-fiction book is a souvenir , just a vessel for the ideas themselves .
You do n’t want the ideas to get stuck in the book … you want them to spread .
Which means that you should n’t hoard the idea !
The more you give away , the better you will do .
Do n’t try to sell your book to everyone .
First , consider this : ” 58 % of the US adult population never reads another book after high school . ”
Then , consider the fact that among people even willing to buy a book , yours is just a tiny little needle in a very big haystack .
Far better to obsess about a little subset of the market –that subset that you have permission to talk with , that subset where you have credibility , and most important , that subset where people just ca n’t live without your book .
Resist with all your might the temptation to hire a publicist to get you on Oprah .
First , you wo n’t get on Oprah ( if you do , drop me a note and I ’ll mention you as the exception ) .
Second , it ’s expensive .
You ’re way better off spending the time and money to do # 5 instead , going after the little micromarkets .
There are some very talented publicists out there ( thanks , Allison ) , but in general , see # 1 .
Think really hard before you spend a year trying to please one person in New York to get your book published by a ‘ real ’ publisher .
You give up a lot of time .
You give up a lot of the upside .
You give up control over what your book reads like and feels like and how it ’s promoted .
Of course , a contract from Knopf and a seat on Jon Stewart ’s couch are great things , but so is being the Queen of England .
That does n’t mean it ’s going to happen to you .
Far more likely is that you discover how to efficiently publish ( either electronically or using POD or a small run press ) a brilliant book that spreads like wildfire among a select group of people .
Your cover matters .
Way more than you think .
If it did n’t , you would n’t need a book … you could just email people the text .
If you have a ‘ real ’ publisher ( # 7 ) , it ’s worth investing in a few things to help them do a better job for you .
Like pre-editing the book before you submit it .
Like putting the right to work on the cover with them in the contract .
And most of all , getting the ability to buy hundreds of books at cost that you can use as samples and promotional pieces .
In case you skipped it , please check # 2 again .
That ’s the most important one , by far .
Blurbs are overrated , imho .
Blog mentions , on the other hand , matter a lot .
If you ’ve got the patience , bookstore signings and talking to book clubs by phone are the two lowest - paid but most guaranteed to work methods you have for promoting a really really good book .
If you do it 200 times a year , it will pay .
Consider the free PDF alternative .
Some have gotten millions of downloads .
No hassles , no time wasted , no trying to make a living on it .
All the joy , in other words , without debating whether you should quit your day job ( you should n’t ! )
If you want to reach people who do n’t normally buy books , show up in places where people who do n’t usually buy books are .
Media places , virtual places and real places too .
Most books that sell by the truckload sell by the caseload .
In other words , sell to organizations that buy on behalf of their members / employees .
Publishing a book is not the same as printing a book .
Publishing is about marketing and sales and distribution and risk .
If you do n’t want to be in that business , do n’t !
Printing a book is trivially easy .
Do n’t let anyone tell you it ’s not .
You ’ll find plenty of printers who can match the look and feel of the bestselling book of your choice for just a few dollars a copy .
That ’s not the hard part .
Bookstores , in general , are run by absolutely terrific people .
Bookstores , in general , are really lousy businesses .
They are often where books go to die .
While some readers will discover your book in a store , it ’s way more likely they will discover the book before they get to the store , and the store is just there hoping to have the right book for the right person at the time she wants it .
If the match is n’t made , no sale .
Writing a book is a tremendous experience .
It pays off intellectually .
It clarifies your thinking .
It builds credibility .
It is a living engine of marketing and idea spreading , working every day to deliver your message with authority .
You should write one .
Here ’s the prequel to this post …
